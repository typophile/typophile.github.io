body: Dear All, <BR> <BR>I hope you can help and I hope this is the right forum.  Just
  installed the Linotype Essentials 1 and 2 sets of fonts on my new Mac &#40;OSX 10.38,
  Quark 5.01 and 6, Suitcase X1, ATM Lite&#41; and I have a problem. <BR> <BR>In both
  versions of Quark some of the fonts both display and print with the bottom of descenders
  sort of chopped off &#40;examples would be Avenir, Caecilia and Ergo among others&#41;.  It
  also happens in Word. <BR> <BR>In Quark 6, adjusting the baseline shift upwards
  slightly seems to correct &#40;a pain but it works&#41;.  In Quark 5, which I need
  to use as some of my clients still use 4, it makes no odds. <BR> <BR>Scratching
  my head here and hoping someone can come to my rescue.  Just moved from OS8 and
  Quark 4 so still finding my way round all this new software, but thhis ones bugging
  me bigtime as I have a deadline &#40;isn&#39;t it always the way&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks
  in advance <BR> <BR>Paula <BR>

    lies do you think? <BR> <BR>Paula

  body: I do believe that is the problem. We just need someone who &#42;really&#42;
    knows what they are talking about to respond to this.

  body: It is not a Linotype problem but Quarks. Same with older versions of Freehand.
    Convert the type to paths and it will print fine.

  body: Typeblog, <BR> <BR>Thanks.  How do I do that &#40;excuse my ignorance&#41;
    <BR> <BR>James, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll give that a try.  Am I right in assuming this
    will effectively make my epson look like a postscript printer?

  body: I wouldn&#39;t recommend turning type to outlines. UNLESS it is only a few
    words. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve actually heard good things about GIMP print.

  body: Hi All, <BR> <BR>Yeah.  This is a 100 odd page book and just worked out that
    Typelog&#39;s suggestion is a bit impractical <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  &#40;but thanks anyway&#41;. <BR> <BR>Installed the GIMP
    thing and have a measure of success.  Quark 6 prints things fine now.  Quark 5
    &#40;and presumably other classic apps&#41; doesn&#39;t seem to want to offer
    me anything but the original epson driver - anyone know if I&#39;m missing something?

  body: GIMP takes advantage of CUPS, which I believe is part of the OSX and other
    UNIX operating systems. Sounds like Q5 may be running under classic so it may
    not be able to take advantage of CUPS. <BR> <BR>I use a more robust version of
    GIMP, PowerRip X, which has very good printer ICC profiles and some support. <BR>
    <BR>I skipped Q5 so I can&#39;t offer much help. I&#39;m assuming it won&#39;t
    run under OSX?

  body: In ATM Light, under Classic, set the prefs to &#34;preserve character shapes&#34;
    rather than &#34;preserve line spacing.&#34; <BR> <BR>Another option is to create
    a PDF and print that.... <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'Dear James, Yes it&#39;ll only run in Classic.  Nasty side efffect of GIMP
    is that it prints at snails pace.  so deleted it.  The good news is that I think
    I was wrong and Quark 6/OSX prints fine and I was mistaken - not about 5 though.
    <BR> <BR>Dear Thomas,  Thanks for the suggestion - makes perfect sense ... but
    tried it and it still doesn&#39;t work ... <BR> <BR>but all I&#39;m going to do
    for now is open the Quark 5 doc in 6, print from there and make sure I don&#39;t
    save it.  In the process of all this, I discovered that the Quark6/OSX printing
    runs a lot faster anyway ... so there may even be an advantage of doing it this
    way. <BR> <BR>STOP PRESS: <BR> <BR>A restart and Thomas&#39; suggestion actually
    WORKED.  Thanks a million everyone.'
