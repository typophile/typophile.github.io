body: "Ok so I've been considering getting an established logo going but there are
  so many good choices out there. I've narrowed it down to 4 different ones that I
  like.\r\n\r\nI'm a freelance web designer but the site is basically non-important
  drivel and banter ... so take that into account when considering which choice. It
  needs to be professional enough to look like I didn't slap Arial on there, but cute
  / playful enough to fit the style of my site. Check out <a href=\"http://tinycrumb.com/home\">the
  site</a> for a better idea of the style I'm going for.\r\n\r\nAlso, along with which
  choice, I'd appreciate any critique on them individually, e.g., if Kerning is off
  on one particular one, if one choice is just really bad type-wise, etc...\r\n\r\nI
  am a noob though so please be nice :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: I like the closed C and rounded r of number 2. I don't understand the name.
    You might think about the name some more. Ask yourself will a client get it?

    And the name stays :) It means something to me.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion
    though. #2 is a favorite of mine too, I just can't decide.\r\n\r\nAny more?"
