  body: "I started to scan through the google version of the book but saw mostly the
    notice that the pages were not part of the preview of this 1972 book. I didn't
    see any equations. Perhaps you could pick a page with them, get the largest scale
    google offers, do a screen grab, clip the image to just the part showing equations
    and relevant text -- if possible including G, g, K, k, R, M, W, and the & -- and
    post the clipped image here.\r\nDon"
