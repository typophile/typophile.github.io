  preliminary. The logos are for green wheels, an organization based on alternative
  forms of transportation, with concerns regarding city planning, bicycle availability,
  bus routes, etc. The main thing that the organization does is put out a quarterly
  newspaper, which I am in charge of laying out. I thought that since the magazine
  addressed many different issues on multiple occasions, that it would be nice to
  have an icon for each occasion. I'm wondering if this kind of thing works for a
  logo at all."

    case you couldn't recognize the TRebuchet. That's what it is. They also made me
    use Curlz for a flier so... *pain*."

  body: "Hello Hofweber, Curls, yes, quite painful! Appreciate their enthusiasm but
    tactfully find a way to remind them that you are the designer.\r\n\r\nI am about
    to give you the safe and traditional approach for your project. \r\nIs the initial
    mark in black the Green Works primary logo? If not, I would suggest to break your
    project into stages. Get the primary logo approved by ALL stakeholders first.
    Only then would I move on to developing a supporting set of icons. First by getting
    a solid approved list of those supporting services (roads, trails). These lockups,
    including the word of the service, along with its' icon should not violate (placed
    in front of, as the orange pylon or a road in the gw) the primary mark but live
    with it/around it. Each service should be displayed with the same font. You use
    several different above. Each icon should also look as if it had been designed
    from the same hand. Rather, illustrated by the same person. The above, forgive
    me, has a clip art feel to it. The icons need to be a simple quick visual read.
    THey should be able to stand on their own and the reader should understand it
    immediately. If not, it needs work. If budget permits, hire an illustrator to
    execute these icons. You can't be all things. The icon/service word lockups should
    be a single color fill. The entire color palette should harmonize. The word and
    icon for each service should always be in the same position, same size, same overall
    weight and treatment. \r\n\r\nAgain, this is the safe approach. By safe, I do
    not mean boring. This approach is simply proven to work. Please let me know if
    I am clear on my suggestions. Most importantly, do not stuck in the pattern of
    the client taking this to option 99. THey'll like it when they they see it type
    of thing. No one wants to design for a moving target. Never drop your work on
    the table and ask them, \"So, what do you think?\" It lacks confidence. You are
    the design professional. They hired you. Tell them, constructively, why it works
    and give them little \"opinion wiggle room\". Get them involved and jazzed about
    it, just don't let them dictate everything...like using the dreaded CURLZ font.
    (They can keep that for their kid's birthday invitations.)\r\n\r\nI am one person
    with one suggestion. There are plenty of talented people here that surely have
    other suggestions. Listen to them all. Somewhere in the middle of it is where
    you'll set your compass to. Good luck and enjoy it!"

  body: "The situation with curlz is that they had already made event invitations
    without consulting me and not knowing that I would do the poster. Even with something
    as dumb as curlz it's important to maintain event identity so I let it slide.\r\n\r\nYou
    are right about the quick read being important. Unfortunately it is not within
    our budget to hire an illustrator, let alone me. I'm doing this all pro-bono as
    an exercise and self promotion, just like everyone else working there (there are
    three main people). All words shown there are the same typeface (trebuchet). The
    original logo has been approved by everyone, so I thought I would expand. I'll
    try to work on the color palette."
