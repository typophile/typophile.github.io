  Klingspor \r\n\r\n\r\nOffenbach, Germany. Formaly known as [[Rudhard'sche Giesserei]],
  renamed on January 1 1906 to Gebr\xFCder Klingspor.\r\n\r\nWell kown for designs
  from [[Rudolf Koch]] and [[Walter Tiemann]]. Also sold designs from [[Peter Behrens]],
  [[Karlgeorg Hoefer]], [[Otto Hupp]], [[Otto Eckmann]], [[Rudo Spemann]], [[Victor
  Hammer]] and [[Hans K\xFChne]].\r\n\r\nDuring the 1950s, the foundry's operations
  closed. [[D. Stempel AG]], who had owned the foundry for over a decade, continued
  distributing most of the typefaces. Many of the typefaces are sold in digital format
  today by [[Linotype Library]] (the German Linotype AG purchased D. Stempel AG in
  1985).\r\n\r\nToday, the majority of Klingspor paraphenailia, including type specimens
  and books printed in Klingspor faces, as well as many handwritten pieces by Koch
  and other designers, are housed in the [[Klingspor Museum]] in Offenbach. Their
  website is <a href=\"http://www.klingspor-museum.de\">klingspor-museum.de</a>.\r\n\r\nThe
  Klingspor foundry, as well as its suceeding museum, have always had a close relationship
  with the Offenbach School of Design, which has had various names but has been known
  as the [[HfG Offenbach]] since 1970."
