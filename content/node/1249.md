  best when using midtones instead of B&amp;W only, I&#39;m struggling to find a solution
  to it. Has anybody think of a method of using images as fonts instead of having
  to convert everything into vectors. <BR> <BR>Tilou '

  body: 'Another solution, used by Dennis Ortiz-Lopez and others, is to create several
    fonts that can be layered, one on top of the other. The base font would be the
    letter shape itself &#40;in solid B&amp;W form&#41;. The next font would be, say,
    a bevel effect, also in solid B&amp;W form, which would be printed in a greyscale
    or any color determined by the user of the font. Another font could be an outline
    layer, an inline layer, etc. <BR> <BR>Ortiz-Lopez&#39; work can be seen at: <BR>

  body: If you are going to experiment along the lines of halftone screens, it might
    be an idea to experiment with line patterns instead of dot patterns, it might
    help reduce file sizes / complexity and can look rather nice if done well. <BR>
    <BR>As for bitmap fonts, they do exist, certainly on the Mac, and can be edited
    with packages like FontLab&#39;s BitFonter &#40;<A HREF="http://www.fontlab.com/html/bitfonter.html"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.fontlab.com/html/bitfonter.html</A>&#41;. I can&#39;t
    say i am too hot on the technology side of these though - perhaps you can get
    some useful info by downloading the manual for it? <BR> <BR>Enjoy <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
