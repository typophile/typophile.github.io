  Our neighborhood is ripe for some life in it's signage because let's face it, squished
  and stretched giant arial on banner vinyl swinging from a beige awning just doesn't
  cut it.\r\n\r\nour drawback is we know very little and we're having a hard time
  finding reliable resources regarding materials, techniques, etc... i'm guessing
  at least a few typophiles have participated in this activity so I humbly request
  your insight and experience. We are mostly wondering where to start with paints
  so that cleanup and removal is as easy as possible later on\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n_will"

    store]] all the time. You can use just about any paint from the hardware store
    and any brush, though the pros probably use One Shot and horse hair. I've never
    had any trouble cleaning it off with a razor blade. This is a case where experimentation
    is a good teacher until you find someone who can tell you exactly what to do.\r\n"
