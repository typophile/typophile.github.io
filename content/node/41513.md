  body: "I don't usually venture into the \"critique\" section, but I was just browsing
    the new posts and thought \"Antarctica? Who's posting about typography in Antarctica?
    I have to see this....\"\r\n\r\nGeneral: You're heading towards a usable modern
    sans, pretty monoline. Nothing wrong with that. I'm a little surprised by the
    proportions in that the caps feel a significantly more condensed than the lowercase:
    I compare the lowercase oh to the cap Oh for instance. That could simply be one
    of the hallmarks of the typeface, as long as you're aware of it and doing it on
    purpose.\r\n\r\nDetails that need work:\r\n\r\nYour i and j dots look a bit heavy.\r\n\r\nThe
    top arch of the \"r\" seems heavier than other horizontal round strokes (there
    are times when this can work, but it's usually when that arch is very curved and
    the join is quite incised, rather than such a long flat stroke).\r\n\r\nThe left
    side of the \"j\" doesn't need such a honking big sidebearing given that the curve
    is below the baseline - just kern it away if it follows g or q.\r\n\r\nThe tilde
    is too light. There's some good writing about accent weight and design (a.k.a.
    diacritics) online, which you should dig into at some point.\r\n\r\nThe small
    \"s\" feels a bit too much like two nice curvy bits that got glued together -
    need to work on the spine in the middle. The bottom curve of the cap S needs work,
    feels very lumpy, and also has a bit of the join problem but in a different spot
    (slightly further down to the right).\r\n\r\nThe lowercase \"a\" feels a bit wide
    compared to the e and o.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the \"R\" bowl where the leg joins
    it feels a little smushed in (towards the bowl). Normally I'd expect the R and
    P bowls to be similar in shape, although the P bowl can be slightly larger/lower
    if you wish.\r\n\r\nCertain places where a round shape becomes straight the join
    looks awkward and could be slightly more gradual. For example, the bottom part
    of the P bowl (whereas the top is better).\r\n\r\nThere is some odd lumpiness
    in just a few of the curves that makes me suspect you're using more control points
    than needed, or perhaps it's just the placement that needs work. I see this when
    zooming in on the lowercase \"c\" for instance. Maybe I'm tired or imagining it,
    I dunno.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Some of the characters seem smaller. It seems your overshoot isn't very consistent.
    Consider adding overshoot to:\r\n- bowl of the <strong>a</strong>\r\n- bottom
    of the bowl of the <strong>b</strong>\r\n- bottom of the <strong>c</strong>\r\n-
    bottom of the bowl of the <strong>d</strong>\r\n- top of the <strong>g</strong>\r\n-
    top of the <strong>m</strong> (compare to <strong>n</strong>)\r\n- bowl of the
    <strong>p</strong>\r\n- bottom of the <strong>u</strong>\r\n\r\nLower the crossbar
    of the <strong>f</strong>, it's above the x-hight. I would lower the waist of
    the <strong>k</strong> slightly, as well. The <strong>s</strong> is falling to
    the left. The <strong>y</strong> is fine, but you could try what happens if you
    let the two strokes of the <strong>y</strong> meet on the baseline.\r\n\r\nI agree
    with Thomas about the caps. They are ok on themselves, but compared to the lowercase,
    they do seem to be somewhat narrow. Also the dots on the <strong>i</strong>, the
    period and the comma are very large."

  body: "If you can get narrow and happy, more power to you. I think it's a good idea.
    As of now, to me it looks too much like an artificially narrowed or 'squooshed'
    face. It has a 'reversed contrast' look even though it may not be geometrically
    if you measure it. To look equal the verticals have to be thicker than the horizontals,
    and the vertical rounds have to be thicker than the vertical stems. \r\n\r\nIf
    you *want* to go for a reversed contrast look, compare Antique Olive or the typefaces
    of [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/designer/evert_bloemsma/|Evert Bloesma]], especially
    FF Balance and Legato. A narrow face that works very well for readability is Gerard
    Unger's [[http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-vesta.html|Vesta]], though
    it is very neutral, and not what you are going for. \r\n\r\nAlso, your straight-to-round
    curves are often lumpy. At this point getting the weights and shapes good is probably
    more important, but down the road these should be worked on as this sleek style
    calls for a high polish. \r\n\r\nI know you can do 'happy' wonderfully well from
    your fat and happy typeface. This has promise, and is worth working on, but does
    have a way to go to get what you are aiming at. "

  body: Can't write a lenghty reply right now, but what I see right away is that the
    <strong>b</strong> doesn't look right to me. I quickly traced it and fiddled with
    it, and I think you can either flip the bowl horizontally, or rotate your <strong>q</strong>
    and flip its bowl horizontally as well. I think the latter looks best. It will
    beed a bit of tweaking after rotating/flipping ofcourse.

  body: "I think that the lowercase c and a are the strongest characters i see. There's
    something about the curves on the top that I feel should be mirrored in the ear
    of the lowercase r, h, et cetera. The lowercase t is really tall. Most faces have
    the t actually lower than the tittle on the lowercase i, and the h, k, l and f
    higher. On a lot of faces, the lc l is higher than the uppercase I.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems that the caps almost look like you're trying to make them monospaced, especially
    the M. Try to rely more on optics than precise measurements. This is something
    i'm trying to get out of as well.\r\n\r\nThe letterspacing that you have for your
    main image (where it just says Antarctica) works much better than on your pdf
    for test 2.\r\n\r\nI think it's a very interesting typeface, i think it's somewhere
    between Verdana and Univers. I will look forward to what becomes of it!"

  body: "It seems that the top arch of the \"r\" is too long, there's a lot of white
    space below it. When the \"r\" is between two vertical letters (\"i\"and \"l\",
    for instance, as in \"girl\"), the black and the white areas don't look very well
    balanced. Maybe the \"r\" can be narrower. On the other hand, the \"w\" look darker
    than the other letters - shouldn't it be wider?\r\nI also think that this lovely
    Beatles song will look better with smaller commas...\r\n\r\n"
