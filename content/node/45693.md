  can use font creator or fontlab for this task, but in both programs, I am forced
  to use mouse.... which gives pain and slow work...\r\nCan anyone tell me of a better
  program where renaming of glyphs is faster and more easier than above programs.......
  Thnx"

  body: You could try the [[http://letterror.com/code/ttx/index.html|TTX library]].
    It does not compile and decompile <em>all</em> fonts 100% correctly, but if it
    works for your font, you can edit it at will with your favourite plain text editor.

  body: "<cite> you can edit it at will with your favourite plain text editor.</cite>\r\n\r\nOn
    a mac you can avoid pain and slow work if you use the Unix stream editor <code>sed</code>
    instead of \"your favourite plain text editor\". For instance, if you start with
    <code>MinionPro-Regular.otf</code>, apply <code>ttx</code> to it to get <code>MinionPro-Regular.ttx</code>
    and want to replace every occurrence of <code> Scommaaccent</code> with <code>
    uni0218</code> you can use the line command\r\n<code>\r\nsed 's/Scommaaccent/uni0218/g'
    MinionPro-Regular.ttx > MinionPro-Regular#1.ttx\r\n</code>\r\nand then <code>ttx
    MinionPro-Regular#1.ttx</code> gives you the  <code>otf</code> font you want in
    <code>MinionPro-Regular#1.otf</code>. You could also place a list of substitutions
    in a sed script and apply them all to the <code>ttx</code> file (to replace all
    commaaccent names with their corresponding uniXXXX name for instance). You could
    push the scripting process further and process with a single Bash script  all
    the fontfiles in a directory; scripts help working fast, and help avoiding errors.\r\n\r\nMichel"

    user and cannot handel scripting and programming. :(\r\nI saw some people talking
    about keyboard shortcuts in fontlab... If it is possible to use them for fast
    renaming of glyphs.... Which keystrokes might be useful?"

  body: "If you can't use a script or other program (I use an old Y&Y TeX program
    & Vedit on PFA & AFM files -- the same S&R routines also work on .fea files, etc.),
    and have to work inside FontLab, you will have to use alt+G+R.  When the window
    comes up, you'll be in the new name field. Delete any name there, type in your
    new tame, tab twice & you're in the Unicode field, & type that in, & hit \"Enter\".
    BTW, you can store parts of names in \"copy & paste,\" so if using only Fontlab,
    when (for example) I name small caps, I store \".smcp\". Then all I have to type
    is A and the keystroke sequence to paste in \".smcp\". Cuts down on typos.\r\n\r\nEasier
    to use auxiliary programs, though."
