  pages set in twenty-four point text, I mean a <em>proper</em> book.\r\n<em>The Royal
  Road to Card Magic</em>, 2nd edn. I plucked a copy off the shelf of my local WHSmith,
  thinking to myself, \"Is this title familiar because I've read about it somewhere,
  or just because I've seen it on this shelf before?\", and opened it at random, as
  one does. \r\nEek! \r\nMaybe the great VC should have a quiet word with the publisher? "

  body: "Hmm, depends how far condensed it was. (95%? I think mine is ickier. 65%?
    You win!) You'd think if they were dead set on Arial (like, they were restricted
    to PC system fonts for some reason), someone would at least have said, \"...but
    we need it to be narrower. Hey, what's this font called Arial Narrow?\"\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: "Yikes. Don\u2019t think this book had the budget for that though. Seeing
    the thread about colophons, it would have been amusing had this book had one,
    i.e., being proud of the type choice and wanting to point it out to the general
    reader... but, no. \r\n\r\nNote, everything from the TOC to the index was set
    in CS; only the title page, half-title, and publisher's imprint page were set
    in regular book faces...\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver
