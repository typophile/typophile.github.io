    control over their properties and partial control over their neighbors&#39;.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Wonderful quote from that article. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, runaway capitalism
    and historic preservation don&#39;t always mesh well.'

    such gorgeous structures. ;-&#41;

  body: Bull. <BR>A project only needs a lot of money if its participants are materialistic.
    I remember at TypeCon when Jan Middendorp asked Saki Mafundikwa &#34;how do you
    get the money to do all this?&#34;, he basically replied that nobody working on
    it cares too much about wealth. Some people simply don&#39;t realize that it&#39;s
    not money that makes the world go around, it&#39;s emotion. If you really care
    about quality, avoid relying on people who only care about money and not the project
    itself. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Eventually everything falls apart or needs to be replaced. I find historic
    preservation to be a sometimes over-zealous pursuit. Not every building by Famous
    Architect needs to stand for eternity. However, I&#39;m from Philly, which is
    home to just about every &#34;first X in the United States,&#34; so I&#39;m a
    bit jaded. My concern is what replaces the torn-down building. <BR> <BR>What <i>really</i>
    bothers me is the McMansion and pre-fab home craze in the U.S. Now most homes
    are built to be cheap and generic. I can&#39;t count the number of homes in suburbia
    that have one enormous wall covered in aluminum siding, with no windows, or an
    itty-bitty one at the very top. Bleh. Those things&#39;ll tear <i>themselves</i>
    down. <BR> <BR>::takes post-rant breath::'

    <BR>Though, certainly places like the former USSR have some amazing architecture
    that was both built, and remained intact largely due to communism. The recent
    influx of capitalism there has caused a huge historical preservation battle as
    many, many historically and architecturally significant structures are being torn
    down left and right. <BR> <BR>Granted, the USSR&#39;s flavour of communism also
    had a few drawbacks in other areas ;o&#41;'

    <BR> <BR>In Yerevan, you go down to the cool, cheap and timely metro stations
    &#40;which were built towards the end of the Soviet era in Armenia&#41; and see
    lettering installations in large, classical Armenian caps, in bronze. You come
    out of the stations and are confronted by donut shops exhibiting a sick Armenian
    cut of Cooper Black, in vinyl. As this old geezer who hangs around Republic Square
    constantly heckles: &#34;Meruh kounem angakhoutyan&#34; = &#34;May I f&#42;ck
    independence&#39;s mother&#34;. The whole thing was an IMF ploy - now most of
    the big businesses &#40;like our prized brandy&#41; are owned by foreign interests.
    And did this all actually help the people of Armenia, did it &#34;trickle down&#34;,
    so to speak? Of course not, because that would be bad business... <BR> <BR>hhp'
