body: I've always been intrigued by the way Kanji looks. I think that it is the utmost
  intelligent style of typography. Again, just like everything else, the Japanese
  out do the rest of the world in almost everything....Even in the culture's most
  simplest form of communication, they make it beautiful... [img:sites/default/files/old-images/images_3781.jpg]

  body: "Japenese marks remind me of logos rather than letters. I agree that they
    are beautiful, organic and very expressive. Have you thought about studying Japanese?
    Learning how to write this way will influence they way you look at your own writing
    and how you dot each \"i\" and cross each \"t\". Japanese culture is quite amazing
    and the design coming from this part of the world is exploding. Have you seen
    the magazine IDEA or looked at the work of Tadanori Yokoo, http://www.tadanoriyokoo.com/
    You can see some of his stop animation (where he uses still imagery) to make videos,
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wYALOq22QE. \r\n\r\nI have this japanese poster
    hanging outside of my office (see below.) I was told it was a Japanese announcement
    for a Sumo Wrestling Tournament. The bigger the name means the bigger the Sumo
    wrestler. \r\n\r\nAs you can see, I love Japanese design and think it is beautiful
    as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sumotype_6364.jpg]"

  body: 'I agree. I love Japanese writing so much. I studied Japanese in high school
    for 2 years and it was so amazing to see how the formation of the characters are
    created. The only problem with Japanese writing is doing it correctly. There is
    a specific stroke order that the character is supposed to be written. That to
    me is the most difficult part of learning Japanese as well as learning all the
    characters. Learning Japanese does make you realize the beauty in creating fluid
    movement in whatever you create. '

  body: "I actually have been doing Japanese and Korean martial arts for the last
    thirteen years (on and off). This kind of put me in a position to immerse myself
    in the cultures and also pick up a nominal bit of the spoken language.For the
    most part, I've come to understand how it is organized and the concept for the
    writing of characters. I completely agree that it more resembles logos rather
    that text because that is exactly what each character is. \r\nThe rudementary
    basis for character writing, in ancient times, was basically a drawing of an idea
    that a person was trying to convey.Throughout the years the written aspect of
    the language has become slightly more simplified, in which they have now incorperated
    a phonetic alphabet. If you're looking at Kanji though, it is a bunch of different
    logos.\r\n\r\nI put this atatchment up to better explain. Notice the older, ancient
    writing which is at the top, and the Kanji, or written language at the bottom.
    If you notice, the written language actually represents the pictogram in shape,
    look close.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/knji_4911.gif]\r\n\r\nby the way...that's

  body: "I've been studying Japanese for three years now, and before I began I had
    the same sort of attitude towards the lettering. It was beautiful and artistic.
    But, as I started to put a meaning to the symbols, it completely lost the beauty
    it held in my eyes. For me, it became no more unique than writing an A or a B,
    but more time-consuming.\r\n\r\nThe two basic writing forms, Hiragana and Katakana,
    are far simpler than kanji, of course, but at this point I've even started to
    dissect kanji into their basic elements.\r\n\r\nAs CSGilmor pointed out, the kanji
    are basically simplified pictograms, and the example my teacher used the first
    day of class was kuruma, or car which looks like this: \u8ECA. With a little imagination,
    this looks like a simplified picture of a cart from above. Imagine the vertical
    line as the wheel axle and go from there. With more advanced study, it's also
    fascinating to start picking out the elements that tie the kanji together by concept.\r\n\r\nFor
    example, \u8A9E (go) means language, \u8A71\u3059 (hanasu) means speak*, and \u8A69
    (shi) means poem. In addition, they can be combined with different characters
    to form other words such as \"literature,\" \"composition,\" and \"linguistics.\"
    The three kanji are related by a relatively abstract concept of communication
    through words, but they all begin with the same strokes which make up itte, to
    say: \u8A00\u3063\u3066. On a whole different front, the symbol for 5 (pronounced
    \"go\") is \u4E94 and can be found in the upper right of \"go\" as in language.\r\n\r\nJapanese
    is a fascinating language, and I encourage anyone interested to study it. You
    may no longer be able to see the \"prettyness,\" of a block of text, but there
    are far more fascinating subtleties in the language just beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nFor
    better views of the kanji, please <a href=http://i141.photobucket.com/albums/r68/Raxacoricofallapatorius/kanjiexamples.jpg>click
    here.</a> I would include the image here, but as I'm new here I can't figure out
    how.\r\n\r\n* as in \"I speak Japanese.\""

  body: It's true the the kanji are originally Chinese characters, but in modern times
    they're as much a part of the Japanese language as the Chinese. In Chinese, the
    kanji almost always have different readings and meanings, however.

  body: The basis of Kanji is Chinese. However, the kanji was adopted by the Japanese
    in 57ad during the Han dynasty. Kanji holds the basic principals of Japanese writing.The
    actual translation of Kanji in Japanese results in "Han", relating to the Han
    dynasty.
