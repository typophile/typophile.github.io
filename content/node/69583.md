  (Bringhurst) that modern digital fonts named Janson or Jenson are based on fonts
  that were not actually created by Janson, but by Kris. I have not seen anything
  that specifically relates this to Adobe Jenson (by Robert Slimbach), however. Can
  anyoone confirm if this is the case? Bonus points for references to published sources
  on this.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am wishing for some published discussion of Slimbach's design
  process for Jenson. In particular, I am curious to know what issues were faced in
  reating the italic, based on Arrighi, to the roman.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nSarah"

  body: Janson and Jenson are two distinct designs with different creators and histories.
    Kis (not Kris) is the name associated with Janson, but that's unrelated to Jenson.
    Hope that helps with your research.

    Jenson. (I'm talking the roughly letter-size booklet with the muted dark olive
    green cover, not the specimen book.) Your best bet would be to get a copy of that.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    Sorry about that.

    box at the moment.  :(\r\n\r\nI'd contact somebody in the Adobe type team. Miguel
    Sousa and Christopher Slye are here on Typophile a fair bit. If one of them doesn't
    chime in, you can look one of them up and shoot them a private message.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT "

  body: "Unfortunately, there are all sorts of copyright issues with various illustrative
    items in the specimen books and in the Adobe Jenson big book. They originally
    had clearances to use them in print for however many copies, but of course nobody
    thought at the time about electronic versions. At one time the good folks at Adobe
    were working on getting said clearances, but that was many years/layoffs ago.
    It would be cool if it happened, but I wouldn't hold my breath.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "The first revival of Jenson was by William Morris, which kick-started the
    historicist era of typography.\r\nThat was the Golden Type, which really doesn't
    look much like the original.\r\nThen it was revived by private presses, e.g. Bertram
    Goodhue's Merrymount.\r\nThen for the largest foundry, ATF, by Morris Benton:
    Cloister.\r\nThen by Bruce Rogers: Centaur.\r\nStrangely, there was no large x-height
    ITC Jenson in the 1970s/80s, but there is ITC Legacy from the 1990s.\r\nOther
    digital Jensons today include Frere-Jones' Hightower, and my own Nicholas/Goodchild
    (with the large x-height).\r\nBenicia by Jim Parkinson, also based on the \"Morrisonian\"
    school of Jenson faces.\r\nI'm sure there are more, but I can't think of them
    right now.\r\n\r\nStrange but true: ATF published a type named Jenson, based on
    Morris' Golden Type, drawn by a fellow named Phinney.\r\n"

  body: "Christopher: Ah, but there IS a large Adobe Jenson book as well as the small
    specimen book. So I was half-right.\r\n\r\nNick: My very distant cousin Joseph
    W. Phinney (whose grand-daughter I have met, btw), certainly arranged for ATF's
    Jenson, and possibly art-directed it, but my impression is that he didn't do drawings
    per se, just referred the punch-cutter to Morris's version and gave some input.
    Although it was done at Phinney's behest, I tend to give most of the execution
    credit to the punch-cutter, whose name is escaping me at the moment. (Being in
    mid-move, of course my books are all packed, and shall remain so for a couple
    of months at least.) Of course, ATF Jenson is very derivative, so one could debate
    how appropriate any \"designer\" credit would be....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
