  More info: [[http://scripts.sil.org/CharisSILfont]]</em>\r\n\r\nI've been using
  Charis for some time now and every once a while I adjust it some more to my liking.
  I know that some you did your own modifications (e.g. Charles Ellertson, Richard
  Fink), are you willing to share your version of the font?\r\n\r\nTo set a good example,
  [[http://sunedonath.de/misc/Charta.zip|here is my version]] \u2013 unoriginally
  renamed to \u201CCharta\u201D (German for \u201Ccharter\u201D) since modified versions
  must be renamed according to the SIL license.\r\n\r\nWhat I changed (as far as I
  remember):\r\n- Added kerning\r\n- Respaced the italics (Charis' italics are too
  tight, in my opinion)\r\n- Slightly emboldened the superscript numbers\r\n- (Charta
  includes only a subset of Charis' characters)"
