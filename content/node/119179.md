body: Hi, I was wondering if there is any more of this typeface anywhere? Or something
  similar at least. I like the industrial look of it. This image I've found on this
  forum saying it was designed by Engelhardt. I couldn't find anything else similar
  to this font made by Engelhardt on the internet. Any help would be greatly appreciated
  it. Thankyou

  body: "Most of these numbers, including _7_,  are a variation of a letter pattern
    that first became popular in the Clarendon fonts of the 19th century.  The open
    counter _4_ is a variation of a Didot design, also used in some Bodonis.\r\nHere
    are the numbers from a modern font by Michael Hochleitner that draws on these
    sources. It is close to most of Knud Engelhardt's numbers. Its called Ingegorg
    Fat\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IngegorgFatNumbers_4433.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typejockeys/ingeborg/\r\nHere
    is a 19th century heavy Clarendon by Jordan Davies. Its called Clarendon 618,
    which would have been the name when it was sold as a wooden type\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Clarendon618WoodenTypeFontsNumbers_5775.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/clarendon-618/\r\nHere
    is a modern Bodoni that uses the same open counter _4_ design  as  Knud Engelhardt's
    drawing. Its Olcar Alcaide's Eurotype Bodoni Bold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/EurotypeBodoniBoldNumbers_6741.gif]

  body: "Thank you all for your answers. Sorry Don, I didn't think the exact link
    would help. I have found this site which has a font somewhat similar to what I
    was looking for. Similar more like the architecture of the letter, not so much
    the overall shape. I'm not sure if I'm saying it right. Here is the link: http://www.copenhagentype.dk/?works=palae-ny-antikva\r\n"

  body: "Don't see any numerals in Pal\xE6 Antikva. Do see a very high contrast boxy
    super ellipse letterform with triangular serifs and some ball teminals at the
    end of curled hairlines. Legible only at very large point sizes. _Q_ is ambiguous.
    But if the hairlines were considerably thickened Pal\xE6 Antikva could work with
    \ the Knud Engelhardt design.\r\nBoxy super ellipse designs were a favorite of
    Hermann Zapf and can be found in fonts like his Melior, and in various degrees
    in TC Jasper [img:sites/default/files/old-images/TCJasper_3940.jpg] Cyrus Highsmith's
    Ibis Display, Wolff Olins's Renault, Tom\xE1\u0161 Brousil's RePublic, Nick Shinn's
