  body: I am by no means an *important* designer but have a kind of interesting case
    study. I was part of a team that was charged with redesigning Betty Crocker cookbooks
    to make them more upscale - this was in the mid/late 80s. We trained the photographers,
    reworked all the designs, individualized them, etc. Upshot was they didn't sell
    as well and so Betty reverted back to their more generic midmarket look. This
    was before Martha Stewart Living & Real Simple hit the scene; I think the public
    appetite (so to speak) for more elegant cookbook design has improved since then.

  body: My college's gallery, in a joint effort by our graphics program and the local
    chapter of AIGA, put together an interesting show a couple of years ago. Titled
    LOGO [where the first 'O' is the red circle with a diagonal line through  it],
    the show featured AIGA member logo designs that were either rejected or never
    implemented. It was a pretty cool exhibit. Some of the work never made it for
    very obvious reasons, and some of it was actually very very good, but still "failed."

    can you really blame the design? It might be easier to focus on redesigns. And
    there are some baaaaddd ones out there, like Wrigleys gum. But I don't know if
    it affected sales, and that's what defines a design's success, innit? And there
    will always be some public resistance to change.\r\n\r\nThe Saks Fifth Avenue
    Optima-esque logo did nothing for me and now they are back to a redraw of their
    original script logo.\r\n\r\nOr do you just want to focus on designs that designers
    dislike?\r\n\r\nI loathe the Verizon logo - as do most designers I know, for example,
    but that doesn't seem to be a problem for them.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting one,
    the triangle on the Morgan Stanley logo that Landor got paid umpteen millions
    to design - and now it's gone.\r\n\r\nOr... a friend is rebranding Marriott. I
    told him I liked the M in the circle and he told me it's considered to be ineffective
    and they're dropping it.\r\n\r\nNone of these qualify as either risky or shocking
    tho."

    body: I suspect Morgan Stanley removed the triangle because it was curiously similar
      to some insurance company...their name escapes me at the moment, but their logo
      is essentially a solid blue triangle with their name in it.

    (and generally good) designer made a font for a client but then the client rejected
    it, or at least never bothered to use it: Unger's Capitolium, Frutiger's Devanagari,
    and LettError's MTV typeface. But I don't know about your \"big risk\" here -
    the designers did get paid.\r\n\r\nIn type design it's hard to see \"big risk\"

    if your work is successful! You put an inadvisable amount of hours into it either
    way.  :-/\r\n\r\nMaybe you could say Cassandre took big risks with the way he

    to call him \"Symbol\", since nobody knew how it was supposed to be pronounced.
    When he got the rights back from his old label, he could use the name again. Not
    so much a failed campaign as an awkward way to deal with legal restrictions. Not
    to mention typographically limiting. Though, for a while there, you could download

    to counter the perception that it appealed only to children's tastes, so they
    created their vision of a "grown-up" burger and set to work insulting their customers
    with ads that implied that it's immature to want a burger made to your preferences
    if you don't like onions. On the design front, the restaurants were filled with
    hanging signs that all showed close-up photos of little kids making disgusted
