body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\nI am writing my first article in a monthly column for a popular
  Japanese design portal/blog called CBC-NET.\r\n\r\nMy article is basically a call
  for Japanese designers to consider contemporary typefaces for their designs, basically
  a continuation of the theme for my interview series on <a href=\"http://www.aqworks.com/blog\">my
  own site</a>. \r\n\r\nOne of my arguments is that recent typefaces are more likely
  to work better on the screen, thanks to lower-contrast strokes, larger x-heights,
  more open forms. I know this isn't always the case, there is plenty of old type
  that is suitable for the screen and plenty of new type that isn't, but I suppose
  that typography for the web has become a consideration for many type designers during
  the design process. \r\n\r\nSo my question: \r\n\r\nCan you recommend some typefaces
  that I can introduce in my article where screen use was a consideration? I'm not
  really looking for OS system fonts, pixel fonts or anything that specific designed
  for the screen, but something that was designed for general use, but for which screen
  use was *one* consideration. \r\n\r\nI'm hoping to introduce a few serifs and a
  maybe one sans, the serifs because they traditionally have more trouble on the screen.
  Some low-contrast serif faces I was considering: Dolly, Fedra, Jenny. \r\n\r\nthanks
  for your help!"

  body: "As for sans, anything square and wide does better on screen, due to the pixel
    grid. Although this may be changing now due to modern antialiasing technologies
    like Cleartype.\r\n\r\nI use <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/amplitude_1_wide/\">Amplitude

    of the way it notches out the corners. Should be online in a few days, but unfortunately,
    Japanese only. \r\n\r\nChris"

    of iType, Monotype Imaging's rasterizer. But I was specifically thinking of WPF
    which is going cross-platform (at least when I last saw a blog entry on it). Also
    Windows Mobile, Windows CE, and Windows embedded on various devices. And there
    are also other implementations - such as Freetype... http://david.freetype.org/cleartype-patents.html
