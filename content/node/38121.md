body: "Hello, I am searching out ideas for a print project. I am looking for a text
  font to use with the (House) font <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=27&subpage=viewfontspecimens\"
  target=\"_blank\">Castaway</a> (which I am using for headers). This is a fun eatery
  guide. Target is vegetarians. Needs to complement whimsical illustrations and be
  easily read at 10 or 11 pts. Something on the lines of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/cafeteria/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Cafeteria</a>, but not Cafeteria as it is too condensed. Something
  playful, but no crazy hand lettering. Suggestions greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

    Grenadine</a> or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mvb_fonts/mvb_pedestria/\">MVB
    Pedestria</a> might be just the thing.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_sari_1/\">FF
    Sari</a> would complement Castaway well and can be set in long paragraphs."

  body: MVB Grenadine is great! and is right on the lines of what I am looking for.
    FF Sari reminds me of Barmeno (?) (I think that was the name) and is a good second
    choice. Thanks!
