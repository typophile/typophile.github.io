  our hardest working interns to the task of shipping everything on the 15th. The
  store will then close for a six month hiatus.\r\n\r\nThanks for everybody's support,
  your support has exceeded our target and we're optimistic about a reprint of some
  of the old classics.\r\n\r\nFor now you can get 'em while the ink is still drying:

  body: My new t-shirt arrived (in Melbourne Australia) last night. It's even nicer
    in real life, I can't wait until it warms up so I can wear it.
