  newspaper and would appreciate some critique of how it's looking so far.\r\n\r\nBackground
  information: The paper will be a tabloid (not a red-top) and I'm using the Franklin
  Gothic family for headlines. The college contains mostly art and media courses so
  I'm trying to shy away from the typical newspaper masthead. I can't spare any funds
  on buying fonts so I'm stuck with what we already have which is mostly default and
  a few free downloads. The masthead won't stretch fully across the page, it'll go
  about halfway, positioned at the very top of the page.\r\n\r\nI included both colour
  and black & white versions in the attachment.\r\n\r\nAny and all critique is much
  appreciated. As long as you can back your opinions up be as harsh as you want!"

  body: The bug on the left really breaks the focus of the flag. I wonder if you considered
    just spelling it out underneath in small caps?

  body: "Just to clarify, the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masthead_(publishing)|masthead]]
    of a newspaper lists the staff. The flag or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nameplate_(publishing)|nameplate]]
    is what you are presenting.\r\n\r\nI like that you aren't having the flag span
    the entire page width, so have you considered a vertical arrangement where the
    logo/mark/bug is focused presented on top of the word  \"bulletin\"? I feel like
    you can make that \"BCFE\" mark your flag and keep it to 1/4 or a 1/3 or the page
    width. Below is a rough  and dirty example: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/bulletin_6116.jpg]\r\n\r\n
    I made it on a 5 column measure. I dummied the headline with Franklin Gothic,
    but I think if you're going for atypical, try using Chaparral throughout the paper.
    It is a very nice typeface and much more lively and engaging than Franklin Gothic.
    \r\n\r\nThat said, I don't understand the significance of the mark's tilt. Does
    it resemble any logo or image of the school? I like the shape of the mark, and
    the curves should stay, but maybe just allow it to have straight vertical sides."

  body: "At this stage, I would think primarily in terms of creating a solid full-page
    grid. The masthead works in conjunction with the rest of the page.\r\n\r\nIn your
    attached example, the baseline of the \"bulletin\" portion of the masthead feels
    weak, because of the lowercase \"bu\". I would definitely not use lowercase with
    that particular typeface (and most faces will have the \"bu\" problem).\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, you can do a lot with the free and or stock fonts. A combination of grid
    and appropriate sizing and weighting can yield great results."
