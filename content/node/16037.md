    a massive <a href=\"http://www.magelaan.be\">name change operation</a> which included
    a corporate style system, a corporate brochure and a new website on top of all
    the other work I had to do last month.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://cgi.benl.ebay.be/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=6589225869\">The

  body: They did have auctions in the stone age, no? Same thing, just online. Only
    everyone bids but then waits till the very last second (literally) to put in their,
    hopefully, winning bid.

    right to the picture, <strong>Huidig bod:</strong> means <em>Current bid</em>.
    Right underneath the current bid amount, the button says <strong>Bod plaatsen
    ></strong> which means <em>Place bid</em>. Click it.\r\n\r\nOn the next page,
    in the right hand column, fill in your <strong>Gebruikersnaam</strong> <em>(User
    name)</em> and <strong>Wachtwoord</strong> <em>(Password)</em> and log in by clicking
    the button <strong>Veilig inloggen ></strong>.\r\n(If you are not yet registered
    to eBay, I suggest you do that on the English-language website. That'll save you
    a lot of trouble.)\r\n\r\nOn the next page, you can place your bid where it says
    <strong>\tJe maximumbod:</strong> <em>(Your maximum bid)</em> and then click the
