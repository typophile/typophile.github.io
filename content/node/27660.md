  edge. I looked at <a href=\"http://houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=4\">CHALET</a>,

  have to, but perhaps you guys, gals have an even better idea?\r\n\r\nPlease let

    body: Bryant is beautiful! <strong>I love bryant alt3.</strong> (that v.nearly
      it). The LC letters n,m,c,y,w are just divine. If only it maintained a constant
      letter thickness through the complete letter. By bolder letters it narrows in
      places. And perhaps without the rounded style, (but thats's not a must) <em>I
      am close</em>.

  body: PLT Skopex is nice but a long way from the feel that Chalet, Gotham and bryant
    give me. Fontsmith fonts all have that excentric twing to them that make them
    feel modern and characterful and yet have that pure and refined quality about
    them. Very desirable. Slighty different direction, but real must have fonts.

  body: "<em>Can i get into trouble doing this? :-?</em>\r\n\r\nYou could. Starting
    with existing font data makes your version a derivative work. Some font licenses
    allow derivative works, some don't. Those that do usually restrict what you can
    do with a derivative font. Check the license to find out.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind
    that when you buy a font, you buy a license to use the font as spelled out in
    the license, not the font itself."

    It will be used for the complete corporate ID. From Logo type to body copy.\r\n\r\nThe
    background story is this:- in the past the company hasn't been taken as seriously
    as i'd have liked, partly because of the name and partly because of the old logotype,
    <em>(a clowny fish), hmmmm</em>. \r\nI have designed a NEW logo and am looking
    for a typeface to go with it. I knew which direction i wanted to go from the begining
    so the Logo emblem works fantasmic with Gotham.\r\nI want something pure, serious,
    but with a modern twist. I am bisotted with Gotham, but i feel it needs something
    extra to make it stand out as unique, it's SO pure you don't see it. The logo
    type needs have the feel of, \"I know you don't i? but hey your different\" LOL.
    Perhaps i'll just design a logo type (the word \"clownfish\"), if it's not possible
    to make a derivative.\r\n\r\nI am now seriously considering using the original
    glyph shapes of bryant and chalet in the gotham style.\r\n\r\nWhat does a private
    commission cost? (i know thats a vague question) but give me a ball park figure.
