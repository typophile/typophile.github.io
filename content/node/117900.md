body: "I'm wondering if anyone know the intended use of U+0315, called COMBINING COMMA
  ABOVE RIGHT. Is this glyph intended to be used to represent ejectives/implosives
  in languages which use an apostrophe to indicate glottalization, or is it intended
  to represent the alternate form of the ha\u010Dek found in pairs like \u010E ~ \u010F?
  While the former will always resemble the apostrophe, the latter can differ significantly
  depending on typeface, so I'm wondering which form should ideally be used.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "When an apostrophe is used to indicate a glottal stop, that is regarded as
    a separate letter and thus not an accent mark. However, a transformation of a
    consonant could be indicated by an accent, such as palatalization, so if there
    is such a thing as glottalization...\r\n\r\nAh, yes, Wikipedia tells me that glotallic
    consonants are represented with an apostrophe in the IPA.\r\n\r\nU+0315 was added
    to Unicode in version 1.1, and is a combining diacritical mark. But I can't find
    the original proposal for adding it to Unicode."

    for compatibility with visual encodings that handled e.g. \u010F with a separate
    character from the normal ha\u010Dek. It's mostly useful these days as a component
    glyph for use in making diacritic composites for Czech and Slovak glyph sets.
    Note that although nominally a combining mark it actually requires an advance
    width, so is not usually handled with GPOS dynamic mark positioning."

  body: The glottal stop, when so signaled using one fairly common orthography, uses
    the "raised comma," U+02BC. But remember, that's just one orthography. In Polynesian,
    the glottal stop is signaled with the turned comma, U+02BB, as in Hawai&lsquo;i.
    And in some languages, the glottal stop itself is used.
