  give it a very modern look, if possible. Has anyone discovered any really new/modern
  fonts that share the structure of, yet different enough to combine with Gill Sans?\r\n\r\nI
  have a list of typefaces to combine with Gill Sans already, but I'm not getting
  the modern look offered by so many of today's fonts. They are: Scalla, Joanna, Swift,
  perpetua, Whitman, Goudy, Albertina, Aldus, Bembo, Berling, PMN Caecilia, Chaparral,
  Dante, Garamond, Golden Cockerel, Minion, Palatino, Plantin, Poppl-Pontifex, Caslon.\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n"

      the type _with_ Gill Sans. \r\n\r\nA display face would be acceptable, though
      not required."
