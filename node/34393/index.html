<p>I noticed the Lucida, wasn&rsquo;t sure if they used the Lucida Unicode installed on every Windows machine, but your sleuthing reveals all. I also think Lucida is used as the defalt sans-serif font for Web pages and not just UI, which is nice. Well done Chuck!</p>

<p>This sort of topic, for some Typophiles, may be on the edge of relevancy. Since it&rsquo;s pertinence is not obvious to experts in type aesthetics and history it should, arguably, be moved to &ldquo;Build&rdquo; since it is somewhat technical.</p>
<p>If Apple did make the Mac text-rendering APIs available to the Windows platform, it would be a significant development. There are arguably, four major font rasterizers, and this might make them all available on the same system.</p>

<p>Actually, it turns out they make some decent money off Safari, which will increase if more Windows user switch to Safari. It turns out that when you use an integrated search bar in a browser like Safari or Firefox, the browser maker gets a cut of the ad revenue from the search results:</p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/06/wwdc_2007_keynote"><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/06/wwdc_2007_keynote">http://daringfireball.net/2007/06/wwdc_2007_keynote</a></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a shame, though, that Windows Safari bypasses Cleartype.</p>

<p><cite>Even though Apple seems to make zero profit from Safari itself, bring it to Windoze will help proliferate more apps for the iPhony.</cite></p>
<p>Apple makes a profit from Google every time you use the Google search field in Safari. How do you think Firefox makes money? Same way. And if Apple can bump Safari marketshare from 5% to 10% (not at all unrealistic) then they achieve critical mass on the marketplace and double their profits from Safari.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>That&rsquo;s a great article on the difference between Apple and Microsoft rendering technologies. I have to admit that it&rsquo;s a little weird to see Apple&rsquo;s type renderer in a Windows context. It reminded me of the first time I installed linux on an old beige mac and was presented with a black screen full of ugly type on my Apple display. Weird.</p>
<p>I will say, though, that as a long time Apple user, screen designer, and type designer, I can&rsquo;t stand looking at type on Windows. I can see how the green monospaced type crowd might like Windows type rendering better, though.</p>
<p>I would argue about the &ldquo;better for on screen reading&rdquo; thing as well, but then this would devolve into an infamous typophile &ldquo;readability&rdquo; debate, where everyone cites the best evidence they have: what they personally like better. At any rate, crispness does not readability make.</p>

Contrast this with the near-universal chorus of complaints from the Safari early adaptors. What explains the disparity in reviewer&rsquo;s intolerance?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure that the Bootcamp/Safari comparison is a good one. When people look at a web browser the first question is &ldquo;How does it render stuff?&rdquo; When people fire up Bootcamp, the type rendering is not necessarily the first question. (It&rsquo;s more like, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that little red shield? What, I don&rsquo;t have virus protection? How do I get it? I have to get a subscription?&rdquo; - sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t resist). What&rsquo;s more, I think that most everybody who installed Bootcamp or parallels had a good idea of what Windows looked like before they installed.</p>
<p>That being said, I don&rsquo;t think it was a great idea to replace the default renderer, even though I like Apple&rsquo;s type much better. A good port should be a good citizen in its new environment and try to fit in. I don&rsquo;t think that Apple really intended to be a good windows citizen here, though, which might be the real root of the argument.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Carl, I&rsquo;m curious which four rasterizers you had in mind. Maybe this should be a new thread. It would be interesting to see a bunch of them head to head. These are the ones that I know of: Microsoft ClearType, Apple Quartz, Adobe (ATM?), Freetype, iType (Monotype), D-type (don&rsquo;t know if this is used anywere, but their samples look nice), Bitstream Font Fusion (never really seen this in action either, that I know of).</p>
<p>As for some other renderers: I really like the rasterizer Macromedia built into Fireworks with adjustable super-sampling, weight and sharpness. The new rasterizer for Flash is kind of a mess (see the insert image link at the bottom of the page). I really dislike the rasterizer that Adobe puts into its DTP apps. Photoshop anti-aliasing is mega-blurry, which is fine when you are going to print at 300dpi, but lousy for screen graphics. InDesign and Illustrator rely too much on hinting, distorting the type for on screen reading — bad for wysiwyg apps targeted at high res printers. It would be better for the type to show up a little blurrier, while giving a better sense of how the spacing and color are working out. I&rsquo;ve been tricked more than once into kerning a hinted line of type in InDesign, only to discover upon zooming in/printing that I had been deceived by the hinting.</p>

I guess that’s not an option for a lot of Mac apps, but I only do extended reading in Firefox, Indesign, Textedit, and Preview, so no troubles there. Regardless, Cleartype just isn’t cool enough to justify running Windows. It amazes me that all those years went into trying to make a better OS that I was sick of after five minutes.</p>

<p>No more so than large print books. IMHO web sites and software are too often coded by people who live under the deranged assumption that just because they can read minuscule screen type without much effort, so can everyone else. So I set all my browsers to render at a minimum of twelve points, do word-processing at fourteen, and generally ignore flash sites and software that use small type.</p>
<p>At least I’m technically adept enough to get by like that. I know people running OS X outside of the native screen resolution of their displays because otherwise they can’t read the menu type and are too technologically inept to get by otherwise.</p>

<p>Very true. I just miss the days when new stuff from Microsoft was a really big deal, and really cool. Now I just leave my Windows machine powered-down for months at a time and reminisce about the good old Win2k days. But I just found out that I can watch Akira in HD on an XBox 360, so I may be diving back into the Microsoft world this weekend.</p>

<p>I was just fiddling with <a href="http://typetester.maratz.com/">http://typetester.maratz.com/</a> on my PC and my Mac side by side. I&rsquo;m comming at this as a designer of websites. PC running XP IE6 FF2, Mac Safari 2 .. both sides at default settings since most leave it like it comes out of the box.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe with pc screen typography is that certain sizes of certain fonts look fantastic. But heaven forbid that you specify bold at that size. Or increase the size 1px. Case in point, Arial Bold 14px (nastified). Verdana 16px Bold (bold? bold?). Up to 17px, ok now it&rsquo;s bold, but the spacing is all wack. In fact, i would say px sizes 14+ look ghastly on my pc.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/compare_4242.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>No fair you say? Clear Type not turned on in the PC example. How many users open Control Panel &gt; Display &gt; Effects &gt; Screen Font &gt; Clear Type to click that box? My issue is what joe pc sees when he fires up his Dell box, but Ok. Now clear type is active:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/cleartype_6577.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Hey that 17px is looking much better on the pc. Beter than the mac? Debatable. How is the 16px? Craptastic spacing and contrast. Mac? Still pretty decent.</p>
<p>In conclusion: on a PC without cleartype, 10% of type options get an A, 90% get a C-. With cleartype on, the percentages improve somewhat. Out of the box on a mac, 100% get an A-. I&rsquo;ll take freedom and an A-. Call me artsy.</p>

<p>In all seriousness I think it’s incredibly difficult to objectively compare rendering, especially when you take fonts created for, or tuned for, a particular environment across to another environment. You almost have to compare each platform’s showcase fonts against each other - Verdana and Georgia for aliased TrueType, the ClearType Collection fonts for ClearType, but what for Mac OS?

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sii, I would like to be able to spec 16 pt verdana bold. Eg headlines on a news site. It is not a problem that Arial 12px and 13px are 50% identical? I recognize your :-) And WRT showcase fonts, I would rather a rendering system not require any showcase magic to look good (though I applaud Microsoft&rsquo;s commitment to commisioning type).</p>
<p>Hrant, how can you say Mac rendering is mediocre and leave no comment about CT when my example above shows PC results can be worse than mediocre?  If I ignore the horrid BOLDNESS of the M, the uber tight spacing of the ll and li combos as problems, then yes I am in denial. Also, I understand that cleartype is on by default in vista. It&rsquo;s too bad that won&rsquo;t matter for web designers until vista reaches a critical mass in a few years.</p>
<p>That aside, I spent a little bit of time creating waterfalls. They are 10px-17px reg, bold and italic for arial, verdana, and georgia.</p>
<p>Mac:
<img src="/images/old-images/waterfall_mac_4436.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>PC - no clear type:
<img src="/images/old-images/waterfall_pc_noct_4439.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>PC - clear type:
<img src="/images/old-images/waterfall_pc_ct_6182.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>The good:
Both Mac and PC with clear Type look pretty darn good. PC&rsquo;s stregnth is 10-12px size. Mac&rsquo;s strength is larger sizes and consistency across the waterfall.</p>
<p>The bad:
With PC-ct there are bad combinations you&rsquo;d want to avoid 15px arial bold, 16px verdana bold, and there is more variation from the outlines even at large sizes. Mac is not as crisp as small sizes.</p>
<p>The really bad:
While Mr. Mac and Mr. Clear Type are nice passengers, the person still driving teh bus is Mr. Shagnasty (PC without clear type).</p>
<p>In my opinion:
Considering the pluses and minuses of both, my preference is still for Mac rendering. It shines even more when rendering fonts are not designed as &ldquo;showcase&rdquo; fonts (see the times comparison earlier). Fortunately, displays are increasing in resolution and today&rsquo;s headline sizes are tomorrows text sizes. Hardware to the rescue!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I suppose one of the things that I&rsquo;ll express as a potential caveat to your analysis - is in that I sense you&rsquo;re assuming the future of computing is on the desktop.</p>
<p>With a continued penetration of 50% of all households in the US alone having a desktop in the home, I don&rsquo;t find those demographics encouraging toward development. But the mobile and wireless market poses an interesting occurrence &ndash; having potential to break penetration once the paradigm shift occurs &ndash; allowing the possibilities for concentration of type technologies being placed toward the newer paradigm. That&rsquo;s where we could see the most development impact moving forward, as the smaller realestate foot-print poses critical challenges in type rendering for both functionality and the aesthetic.</p>

So to revise my opinion, my ideal rendering system would use cleartype-style rendering at PC gamma from 0-12px and Quart at Mac gamma from 13px+</p>

<p>On my setup 10px is pretty much too small for reading, and 14px is not too large at all. I&rsquo;m not yet 30, so I think it has more to do with screen resolution than my eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The difference between the two at sub 12px is smaller than the difference above 12px. Which is why originally I said for the full size range I prefer quartz rendering.</p>
</li>

In the Safari PC test, is the gamma different than the PC? ie. does it change both variables: renderer and gamma? It doesn&rsquo;t look like it based on the screen grabs when I view on my PC.</p>

<p>These are your words not mine. I have designed enough type that I wouldn&rsquo;t disrespect an entire field of professionals with a quip. Did I not just say &hellip; I appreciate MS&rsquo;s commitment to commissioning new type in this very thread?</p>
<p>What I am saying is that type designed specifically for screen accounts for a very small percentage of what is out there. The best rendering scheme would aim to make the vast majority of other typle look good too. So to rephrase your words: I&rsquo;d rather that type designers not have to depend on hinting to maximize screen use. Who wouldn&rsquo;t? (perhaps Tom Rickner &ndash; no disrespect :-)</p>
<p><em>The degree of convenient post-rationalization here is… unsurprising. That’s what graphic designers are best at</em></p>

<p>And I&rsquo;d rather bacon not be unhealthy. But it can&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>WYSIWYG is a lie, any way you cut it. When it comes to display setting, it&rsquo;s a livable, generally convenient lie. When it comes to reading onscreen, it&rsquo;s a deadly -but sadly still convenient to some- lie. You don&rsquo;t have to rely on hinting to combat WYSIWYG (bitmaps anyone?) but you do have to rely on something besides a tarted up donkey with blinders.</p>
<p>Yes, most type is not made for the screen. But: we should encourage more of it to be; and most of all let&rsquo;s not punish the ones that are. So the best rendering scheme would not enforce a one-size-fits-all fascism.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the waterfalls Randy. Those are eye-opening. One other thing to try: If you set the anti-aliasing to &ldquo;Light&rdquo; in System Preferences in OS X, it makes for slightly sharper text.</p>
<p>Another factor: as pixel densities get higher, anti-aliaised fuzziness becomes less noticeable, while the wonky spacing and counter sizes (texture) of delta hinted renderers becomes more apparent. This is especially true for mobile devices, which are now commonly approaching 150ppi. Unhinted antialiasing looks amazing at these sizes. I&rsquo;m really interested to see what the type looks like on the iPhone. When people start freaking out about how slick it looks, they of course won&rsquo;t know that they are reacting to the type, but we type nerds are used to that :)</p>
<p>For those that think that the crisp CT type with bad spacing is more useful&hellip; I simply disagree. Ugly spacing is less &lsquo;purdy&rsquo; and less user friendly. As for designers making &ldquo;good&rdquo; fonts: at this point I would be happy with <em>different</em> fonts. I&rsquo;m so sick of the web 5. Ack. Of course with CT there is no such thing as different type: it takes every font and crunches them all into the same shapes. Seriously, look at the examples above. The Verdana renders under CT look like Arial stretched out a little. Even the pixel versions have more flavor. [edit: this is a little bit of hyperbole, there are still obvious differences - but the individual flavors of the type are much more apparent in Quartz].</p>

<p>You got that right! It&rsquo;s cool though: MS spends a ton to remake it&rsquo;s applications to look more like browsers, while Apple just makes the browser run all the apps. Tickles me even before the Leopard is loosed.
It&rsquo;d be nice though if Uncle Ying and Auntie Yang wised-up to the fact that neither &ldquo;we&rdquo; nor the &ldquo;public&rdquo; (nor the republic for that matter), are into their &ldquo;competition&rdquo; on this topic. Having caused billions in damages since it started in 92, with no end in sight, and nothing but disadvantage to all parties from the IT department to reader&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a lose-lose situation for all that just continues to be dragged on at the expense of all concerned&hellip;and for what?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Spotty spacing? First of all Randy&rsquo;s examples suffer from two major flaws: they&rsquo;re using legacy screen fonts; and they&rsquo;re not using Vista. That said, I&rsquo;ve never been highly satisfied with CT. But, again: at least it&rsquo;s trying the right thing. To me intent is the foundation.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s &ldquo;a fair amount of time&rdquo;? I certainly don&rsquo;t believe that I, or anybody else, can scientifically self-field-test extended readability. I&rsquo;ve done two things: gone to Apple stores a dozen times and spent maybe a total of two hours looking; and I&rsquo;ve taken very close looks at the bitmaps generated by the Apple renderer. Since I&rsquo;ve been looking at -and making- screen fonts since 1982, this is enough to feel safe in arriving at a very simple conclusion: Apple does not care about improving onscreen <cite>reading</cite>; they care, in that ol' Modernist way, about the pretty gray blocks. And by extension: Apple no longer cares about type. And there&rsquo;s other evidence of this in other things that Apple has [not] done. The thing is, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind that too much if it was out in the open - but instead we get the opposite: the persistence of the belief -especially among graphic designers- that Apple cares about type, in particular cares about type more than MS. This type of denialism chaps my hide.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t believe MS, as a corporation, cares about type because it cares about us. In fact no public company can care about anything besides money. But I do believe that most people in the MS type department genuinely care; a corporation is typically made up of good people from whom it tries to milk profits; they resist to a certain extent, and this resistence allows for the persistence of true benefit to people. We know who the MS type people are - we&rsquo;ve met them - they come and talk to us, ask us things. Where are the people at Apple&rsquo;s type department? We don&rsquo;t even know them. Peter? Haven&rsquo;t heard a peep from him since 2002. Who else? Nothing, nada. Are they benevolent hermits? I think a much better explanation is that the type of people who are willing/able to make onscreen reading better simply haven&rsquo;t been hired.</p>

Sorry, no vista here. Any improvement would be welcome. Again the waterfalls were generated at <a href="http://typetester.maratz.com/">http://typetester.maratz.com/</a></p>
<p>I also would love to see apple commission new type. I would love to hear that they are constantly striving to improve rendering of type. But the fact that we haven&rsquo;t seen these things doesn&rsquo;t mean that their current results are bad nor that they aren&rsquo;t working to improve things (of course I&rsquo;d rather hear about it). In the mean time we&rsquo;ve heard from at least 4 people in this thread who spend a lot of time reading text rendered on a mac, who say it works for them, at least two of which I can vouch for having a pretty critical eye for type!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I get the angst here. To me, there are areas where both Mac and PC rendering can improve, and it&rsquo;s encouraging to me that both are pretty decent. It&rsquo;s also encouraging to me (as mentioned by Christian and me), that screen resolution is increasing to the point where this is less and less of an issue. I do think there will be healthy bacon (excellent non-hinted screen type). And I also think designing fonts that work well in this environment will continue to be a niche within type design. But the focus will be on the outlines of the type itself, not extra curricular instructions. I for one welcome that possibility.</p>
<p>Coming back to the original topic: can anyone with Safari PC speak to the gamma question I posed earlier? Thanks.</p>

I have to say, cleartype is looks much better to me with the grayscale smoothing added in Vista vs my samples of straight sub pixel RGB horizontal smoohting from XP. Can anyone speak to whether Vista CT also improves spacing? I may have fallen asleep for that part.</p>
<p>Ok. Now all PC users go out and buy a new computer so you can upgrade to Vista. Oh well. I&rsquo;ve set a countdown widget for a decade so I&rsquo;ll know when I can freely use the technology availble now. I think my decade countdown for CSS is winding down.</p>
<p>SuperUltraFabulous that link is pretty funny. I wonder if there&rsquo;s anything behind the story.</p>

<p>Really? Apple is moving in a direction where they define the graphics and typographics of their OS and applications, beyond the reach of normal users and font developers. This is hardly surprising considering the relatively revolutionary nature of the changes coming in Leopard whereby type at a particular size is much less important to the UI relative to the graphic appearance of a more agile set of objects. That is to say, Apple has finally made an OS where all the items are scaleable, (zoomable) in their appearance, even if they are not zoomable in their creator applications. As we all know from Adobe&rsquo;s success, zooming is a big boost to the user&rsquo;s perception of font quality. Apple&rsquo;s not stupid, ya know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More interesting reading.&rdquo;
Not really. This is someone talking about what someone else who doesn&rsquo;t know what they are talking about said&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vista’s rendering has two advantages over XP’s: subpixel positioning, which effectively triples interletter spacing resolution&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really? How you define &ldquo;effective&rdquo; and &ldquo;triples&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d like to know;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>(Pardon me if I&rsquo;m re-stating the obvious here) but I&rsquo;d like to point out that Randy&rsquo;s problem with the PC screenshots he&rsquo;s provided are due to the TrueType Instructions in the Verdana font, not with ClearType as a rendering system.
The TrueType instructions are effectively not used by the Mac, so the result is closer to what you&rsquo;d get by simply scaling the actual outlines, therefore it appears pretty bold. On the PC without ClearType, you see the effect of the TrueType instructions in the font, which for smaller sizes (below 20ppm) affect the weight greatly, in an attempt to make the font more legible. Cleartype makes use of some of the TrueType instructions, but overrides others, which is why Randy sees the effect as &ldquo;slightly improved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This all boils down to the advice that Simon and hrant gave; for a better comparison, use the Cleartype fonts. What you really don&rsquo;t like about Verdana on the PC doesn&rsquo;t have much to do with the rendering system - you just don&rsquo;t like the TrueType instructions in the font. (I&rsquo;ll make no comment on whether I like them - for obvious reasons.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Jason. Yep I understand what your saying. It seems like the best comparrison would be to show several unhinted fonts, several tt hinted fonts, and several cleartype fonts side by side since that&rsquo;s what lives on our computers. I chose verdana, arial and georgia not because of their prowess under a particular rendering system, but because that is what we spend 99% of our time reading on the web (and will for quite some time). I can&rsquo;t wait for Calibri to make the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; list, but I must.</p>
<p>David: the last paragraph of Stephen&rsquo;s link and your comments about resolution independence in leopard are two parts of the same argument (and also says to me that Apple doesn&rsquo;t have their heads in the sand). Which will get here first: Vista market saturation or higher resolution displays? Either way the future, for screen type at least, looks better.</p>
<p>Hrant:
<em>But I never said Apple is stupid: they’re targeting their 5%, graphic designers.</em>
At the moment I think they&rsquo;re targeting the section of the PC market that wishes they were graphic designers :-)</p>
<p><em>Apple has finally made an OS where all the items are scaleable
More Modernism. Sounds great. Doesn’t work.</em>
At 160ppi, 10px type is only 4.5 points (.0625 inches) and shrinking. So, we need things to be scalable. This is not modernism it is survival. Oh, and 16 px verdana bold is starting to look more important.</p>

It&rsquo;s true that 150 ppi is not enough (even my 1200 dpi laser isn&rsquo;t enough as far as I&rsquo;m concerned), but ppi isn&rsquo;t everything. 150 ppi with 16 bit color can carry more data than 150 dpi at 1 bit. This is true of pictures, but it&rsquo;s also true of type. There really isn&rsquo;t a correlation to this principle in the print world, since the ink is always there or not, with a maximum of maybe six colors (3bits ;). That being said, I&rsquo;d rather have a 300dpi screen to read on, for sure.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t found a TrueType renderer for my Treo 650, but as I understand it, the 700p uses ttfs and sub-pixel rendering. I haven&rsquo;t looked at it closely, though.</p>

I know it sounds like a strange idea, but that&rsquo;s because the CT fonts have less restrictive TT instructions in them. The point is that to evaluate optimal results, use fonts designed to give optimal results for each rasterizer. But because of the way tha Mac OS works, it doesn&rsquo;t much matter which font you use, there&rsquo;s no such thing as optimal tuning for the Mac.
It&rsquo;s true that if you instead wanted to test pure results, not optimized results, you should use fonts with no TT instructions.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the Mac solution is really the problem. We&rsquo;ve got different TrueType font engines here, but the Win rasterizer scales and renders type as one would expect from reading the TT (OT) specs, while the Mac rasterizer follows most of the TT (OT) specs, but virtually ignores a fairly critical section of the spec (Hint Instructions.)
I don&rsquo;t want to dredge up the old fight about whether the TT hint instruction set was a good idea (for the 12 or so of us who care ;), but technically, the Win engine follows the specs more closely, and is truer to a font developer&rsquo;s intentions, than the Mac engine.</p>
<p>However that whole idea doesn&rsquo;t affect the real quality of display type. Shifts in hardware technology, and sociological changes in the way we read and process text over the last 10 years have really changed what the &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; way to render text is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten off topic here, but my real comment on the Verdana problems is that the TT instructions in the font were designed to specifically work in a 2-bit, black and white rendering mode. They suffer more than many other faces in some greyscale rendering situations.</p>

<p>Leopard will be including a new text-engine, although I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s a rendering engine, or a overhaul of old code and possibly supporting more OT features.  ATSUI will be replaced by CoreText.  I didn&rsquo;t go to WWDC, and so I&rsquo;m not sure what exactly was discussed.  There is a mailing list, I might join it if it&rsquo;s open.  In any case, since ATSUI functioned on both OS 8.5 and OS X, but with greatly different rasterisation techniques, it might be limited to offering better frameworks for normal application developers to access type features and perhaps also expand OpenType support on the Mac.</p>
<p>Of course we&rsquo;ll have to wait until it&rsquo;s released to know since anyone who has a copy of Leopard is under NDA :(</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi there:</p>
<p>Matthew thanks for posting the scoop on the upcoming architectural changes to Leopard. As it stands right now there is some OpenType support but it is definitely incomplete. For some people, OS level support for the complete OpenType spec is irrelevant due to the fact that these same people use Adobe/Quark products which provide the total access to these features.</p>
<p>It would be a good thing if Apple was to finish the work they started with OpenType in the upcoming Leopard so people using apps MS Word, Pages, or even TextEdit can have full access to all of OpenType&rsquo;s goodies.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s interesting the three apps you noted.  Word, Pages, and TextEdit all use different engines.  Pages and TextEdit&rsquo;s are related, but I&rsquo;ve found subtle difference in mark-positioning for instance between the two when I needed to have a tilde over a lower-case q (a common Spanish abbreviation back in the day).  TextEdit can do it perfectly.  Pages is unable to, and places the tilde to the right of the q (although if I place an a in between the q and ~, it combines the a with the tilde.  You can also select the tilde and a independently, kind of cool).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that that&rsquo;s so much of an error as a warning.  To my knowledge, there is no standard way to encode glyph variants in documents in any of the go-between formats, eg, if I have a UTF-8 encoded plain text document, I can&rsquo;t actually define a glyph variant.  Some programs don&rsquo;t support them, so even if there were a way, they of course wouldn&rsquo;t be able to display it.</p>
