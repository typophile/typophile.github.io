He his 35 years old, and like many of us had a very stressed &quot;modern&quot; life. I come from a very small village and I've seen my family with no stress whatsoever. I usually spent 8 hours on work before a computer, go home eat something, and usually go and work freelancer more 4-5 hours a day&hellip; I wonder if it's necessary all of this.

		<div class="commentbody">My problem is that I love the work, and find it difficult to turn down an interesting sounding project, even if I already have too much on my plate. Recently, I started finding creative ways to deal with this, such as inviting colleagues to collaborate on projects, so I don't feel like I'm under a mountain of work that is only getting heavier, but this is only possible because I'm 100% my own boss. I feel really sorry for the people who are overworked through someone else's decision; at least I know I have only myself to blame.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I also think that the only reason why I sit again at home doing the &quot;same thing&quot; but with extra feeling and with more passion is because I LOVE WHAT I DO. This takes so much time and energy from my life that i have the same problem as you John H. I just can't turn off this design way of life. I don't know if this will change with time (kids &amp; other extras <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>) but we'll see. On this last year I also got a pile of work that I've accepted (with no time at all to do a good job) and got my friends to work on these projects. On the first years I did everything and this is a serious mistake. <BR> <BR>That 20/20 rule is a good idea! <BR> <BR>Thanks for the good vibes and support.</div>
