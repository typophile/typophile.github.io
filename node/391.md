body: Love the forums, but one problem is reading the threads where people post wide
  images. <BR> <BR>Could the templates for the threads be tweaked so that each response
  is it&#39;s own Table and/or DIV so that one large image doesn&#39;t force the entire
  thread into 200&#43; character length lines? <BR> <BR>It would make the forums &#42;so&#42;
  much easier to read...and isn&#39;t that what good typography is about? ;o&#41;

  body: If I&#39;m not mistaken, CSS could easily take care of this.  <BR>It would
    add only a few lines of code to each page.

  body: 'Yeah, it works. Give all of your text a custom class, maybe like this: <BR>
    <BR>&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;This is the text&#60;/font&#62;
    <BR> <BR>Link a stylesheet, or just add the following to your existing styles:
    <BR> <BR>.dontLookLikeCrap {width: 600px} <BR> <BR>And voila, readable text that
    will break at 600px. You could probably make the changes in 5 minutes. You just
    have to make sure that you only apply the style to text, not images within the
    post. With a little work, you should be able to parse the code to avoid applying
    this style to &#60;img&#62; tags.'

  body: Thanks! <BR> <BR>The CSS idea is good, but make it narrower than 600 please
    ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>Also, note that the min-width attribute is broken in IE/PC <IMG

  body: I&#39;ve been lurking here for a few weeks now, just registered so forgive
    me if I&#39;m out of line, but why not switch forum systems completely? <BR> <BR>phpBB
    &#40;<a href="http://www.phpbb.com/" target="_blank">http://www.phpbb.com/</a>&#41;
    is free and has many features this board doesn&#39;t have.  Plus, if it&#39;s
    not included in the basal code, I&#39;m almost certain that variable width pages
    can be added.

  body: They could, Chris, but moving forum systems can be a huge PITA. This particular
    issue is just a minor template tweak.

  body: True, it could be a PITA, though, there are advantages to changing to a more
    advanced system.
