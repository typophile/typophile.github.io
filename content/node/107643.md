  body: "My first impression is that this looks like a customized form of [[http://fontfabric.com/age-free-font/|Age]],
    a free font from Svetoslav Simov at FontFrabric. Also check out [[http://www.ffonts.net/Mathmos-Original.font?text=RIPCURL|Mathmos
    Original]], another freebie.\r\n\r\nI doubt you will find an exact match for your
    sample. It seems most likely the logo would be custom."
