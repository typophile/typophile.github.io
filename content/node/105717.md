body: "Hi everybody,\r\nI'm new to font design. I just started following some Youtube
  tutorials and some posts in this website. but I have a few issues with ligatures.
  I apologize if this topic was already covered.\r\n\r\nI wanted to make a font with
  ligatures of the 4 tones of chinese pin yin.\r\nusually these tones are defined
  by numbers. from 1 to 4.\r\nso I wanted them to appear when I type a vowel + number.
  something like this:\r\na + 1 = \u0101\r\na + 2 = \xE1\r\na + 3 = \u0103\r\na +
  4 = \xE0\r\nsame thing with e i o u\r\nI made new font with Fontlab, added the glyphs
  a_1, a_2, a_3 and a_4 of the ligatures \u0101 \xE1 \u0103 \xE0 just to try with
  these. after it works I will add other vowels. then I made a liga feature<strong>\r\nfeature
  liga {\r\n  sub a one by a_1;\r\n  sub a two by a_2;\r\n  sub a three by a_3;\r\n
  \ sub a four by a_4;\r\n} liga;</strong>\r\n1- In the preview panel I noticed that
  it works fine in the \"OpenType features\" panel (left) but it doesn't work in the
  \"preview\" panel (middle). is this normal?\r\n\r\n2- when I generate the font as
  otf and then install it in the font folder and try it in MS Word, it didn't work.\r\nit
  shows a1a2a3a4 instead of  \u0101\xE1\u0103\xE0\r\nbut when I change the liga feature
  (removing the numbers) into <strong>\r\nfeature liga {\r\n  sub a b by a_1;\r\n
  \ sub a c by a_2;\r\n  sub a d by a_3;\r\n  sub a e by a_4;\r\n} liga;</strong>\r\nit
  works in MS Word when I type:\r\na + b = \u0101\r\na + c = \xE1\r\na + d = \u0103\r\na
  + e = \xE0\r\nbut this is not how I wanted it. I wanted it with the numbers 1,2,3,4.\r\nso
  is it not possible to use the numbers (one, two, three...) in the ligatures? or
  is it an issue with MS Word?\r\nI will be very grateful if anyone has any suggestions.\r\n\r\nthank
  you for your time.\r\n\r\nNoahVN\r\n\r\n"

    think your approach is against the rules of Unicode, but this is quite another
    problem. Technically there is nothing wrong with your code."

    body: "Thanks my friend JanekZ. \r\nI just tried it in HTML document in Firefox
      and it worked without problems. now I'm confused. is the problem that MS Word
      doesn't accept ligatures with numbers in them?\r\n\r\ncould you please explain
      what you mean by \"your approach is against the rules of Unicode\"?\r\nthanks
      a lot."

  body: "I think what he means is that you're trying to use OTL as a kludge for something
    which would be much better achieved through a keyboard layout which either maps
    the vowel + number sequences to precomposed glyphs or which maps numbers to combining
    accents.\r\n\r\nThe problem with what you're doing is that \xE1 isn't a ligature
    of a + 2. By treating it as such, your text stream is still going to consist of
    a2 even if \xE1 appears on screen which is going to interfere with search algorithms,
    etc., and which means that type entered in your font isn't going to work when
    you switch to another font.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to enter pinyin characters this
    way, a keyboard layout is going to work with any font which contains the required
    glyphs, and isn't going to lead to problems with searching or displaying text.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    body: "Thanks Andr\xE9\r\n\"\u0101 \xE1 \u0103 \xE0\" are already glyphs in the
      font. so what you said could be right. but what if I make new glyphs that are
      totally different and want them to react as ligatures and appear when certain
      characters are accompanied with numbers. will that be possible to be made in
      the font itself and not in keyboard layout?\r\n\r\nthanks a lot."

  body: "I cannot support too forcefully the notion that the font is the wrong place
    to address a matter better handled by input method: for example, if you want to
    type 2nd-tone \"a\" in MS Word, you could set its automated spell-checking to
    replace an \"a\" followed by a \"2\" with \xE1.  Alternatively, there used to
    be Word macros for this. \r\n\r\nIn addition it is worth noting that Unicode officially
    uses carons (a.k.a. ha\u010Deks) rather than breves to indicate pinyin's 3rd tone.
    \ Thus Unicode's official description for \u01DA (U+01DA) is \"Latin small letter
    u with diaeresis and caron.\"  I wish it were an independent character, just in
    case I wanted to use a breve, as some folks do, but it isn't.  So if I wanted
    to put 3rd-tone \xFC in a font with a breve instead of a caron I'd probably still
    encode it at U+01DA.  But in fact I've given in and use carons when adding tone-marked
    pinyin vowels to a font: Unicode long since decided Chinese was \"ideographic\"
    (over sinologists' preferred \"logographic\"), in comparison with which ha\u010Dek
    vs. breve is small potatoes.\r\n\r\nDavid"
