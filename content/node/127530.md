  font was designed by Base Design for PSLab, im pretty sure ive seen something similar
  before ie. the wider caps on certain letters (O, G, C). see example below, or more
  examples at: https://basedesign.com/much-brand-attitude/\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

    width' being a search that won't get you far, ive spent the lat 20 minutes visiting
    various sites and having no luck. If any mixed width font comes to mind with anyone
    please share.\r\n\r\nThanks again"
