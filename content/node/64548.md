  body: "The most similar blackletter style I could find for letter shapes was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/caligra/|Caligra]]
    from Mecanorma. The lower case is very similar, and the upper case letters have
    the same basic structure, but would need to be modified to make them fancier as
    on the sign. I think this can be done mostly by adding to the letters, rather
    than re-drawing them.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
