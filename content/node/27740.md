  Carter some time ago where he discussed his method for developing the font Fenway
  for Sports Illustrated. To satisfy SI's needs, he had to create a font that seemed
  roomier than Times New Roman, but did not take up any more space. In order to implement
  this, he used a character chart/map that included a PROPORTIONAL representation
  of how often each character is used in running text (15 A's, 6 B's, 8 C's, etc.)
  This allowed him to more accurately determine whether the font was going to take
  up the right amount of room than typing ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ over and over,
  as Q, X, and Z are rarely used in running text.\r\n\r\nAt our magazine, we have
  been using Gill for years, but want to find another face that looks similar without
  cutting down our word counts. I've been Googling for an hour and don't seem to be
  searching for the right thing. Is anyone familiar with where I can find such a character
  list? \r\n\r\nMatthew"

    old days of copyfitting. These gave you an average width per character per font
    per point size, for the most common text fonts. I don't know if one is available
    online but will take a look.\r\n\r\nHave found a picture of one, but it's too
    small to read (bottom image).\r\n\r\nhttp://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:3vI4sXWPfVkJ:www.graphics-master.com/tools1.html+character+count+chart+copyfitting&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=2"

    with no luck.  I have not used them in 40 years so that is no surprise.  As Patty
    said, there were characters-per-pica tables of the more popular typefaces of the
    time in copyfitting books and even some speciman books.\r\nMy suggestion would
    be to get a known text that fits the space you require and reset it i n several
    alternates tou your existing typeface to see which fits best.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

      to find a couple alternates that have similar features and then try from there.\r\n\r\nThis
      site is awesome! Thank you all for being so helpful!\r\n\r\nMatthew"

  body: "You can also adjust H&Js to make the copy fit better. I have several H&Js
    I use - tight, normal, and loose. Gill (as discussed in another thread) is not
    well kerned. If you want a similar look you could try Agenda, Bliss, or Today
    Sans for example. Flow them in and see how they compare. Of course if you don't
    already own them that might be a challenge.\r\n\r\nHaberule, haven't heard that
    in awhile. Rubylith anyone?"

    count.\r\nI also faced such issues, and used LetterMeter to get some clues about
    where I could spare significant space regarding to the most used letters. This
    is only valid for one-language setting only, though."
