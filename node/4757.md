  body: Dmitry, are the colors set in stone? Not that its a problem but red, black
    and orange, black are used alot. You might blend in rather than stand out. Look
    at a metalic orange or floursanent color. I like 3 if you could imply motion better.
    Gradients in the archs, or dividing the arcs so pieces go from apart to solid.
    Good solid work your not far away.

  body: 4a, no doubt. <BR>More space between the name and the text could make it look
    better

  body: Dmitry, I understand the client&#39;s desire to have more forceful &#40;rather
    than primarily dynamic&#41; typography, but I&#39;m with you in saying that I
    think that revision detracts from the overall logo. It&#39;s still very effective,
    though, particularly with that nice marque. <BR> <BR>Perhaps this is a regionally
    biased viewpoint, but where I live currently &#40;in the US&#41;, orange is the
    &#34;universal colour&#34; to represent construction
