  body: The other one looks like it might have been obliqued rather than a true italic.
    Yes, the e's are strange looking. If you do in fact have leeway, why not use the
    Galliard there too? Perhaps roman to offset the italic in the logo?

    font is missing in a PDF.

    a complimentary sans.

    site that looks like this[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ac.jpg]\r\nThat looks
    like a good call about AdobeSerifMM Mark.\r\n\r\nI remember Yves made a long post
    about Adobe Font substitutions some time ago. I'm wondering how to create an Illustrator
    file with editable text that one could use to demonstrate it. Could you edit the
    font name in a file, so that it always substituted??\r\n\r\nRichard\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    fixed the image Mark. I just tried editing the font name (using a text editor)
    in a simple EPS file to something gibberish, but it syill opened without substitution
    in Illustrator :("

    as well.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aqua.jpg]\r\nSome of the characters
    seem to have been individually slanted, particularly the A, which would suggest
    that it has become some sort of \"designed\" logo, but the text must still have
    been text, or it wouldn't have substituted\u2026 ?\r\n\r\nAnd I think you're right
    about the Garamond on their site Mark.\r\n"

  body: "That artificially boldened Garamond No 5 italic is so similar to the Galliard
    ital, I reiterate why not be consistent? I bet the web designer was trying to
    match the Galliard (especially the distinctive w) and either couldn't find it
    or was too cheap to spring for it.\r\n\r\nI bet if you subbed the galliard italic
    the client wouldn't even notice the difference anyway.\r\n\r\nI noticed the A
    looked a bit slanty too."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aqua.gif]\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the
    Garamond fits with the text under the logo, too. The loose spacing indicates that
    it was artificially boldened like on the website.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Galliard
    oddities, not all cuts of Galliard are identical. The Bitstream version has a
    slightly more slanted A than the Linotype/Adobe version, not as slanted as this
    though. FYI, the Bitstream version is more \"true\" since Carter supervised its
    digitization. The spacing in the italics in the Linotype/Adobe version is not
    so good."
