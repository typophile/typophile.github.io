  body: I highly recommend Kai's <a href="http://letterlabor.de/book.php">book</a>
    on the making of Neutral. Excerpts will be published in the next issue of the
    [[SOTA]] publication <em>[[Interrobang]]</em> which will be available at <a href="http://typecon.com">TypeCon</a>
    in Seattle.

  body: It looks like a well constructed font, based on a well constructed philosophy.
    Given that his intended audience includes primarily the conceptual artist (from
    Kai's book), the idealogical underpinnings are sure to appeal. That said, I don't
    think it really adds anything new to the typographic landscape. Hats off to him
    though, I'll wager he learned a bundle in the process (ed. I did from reading
    the book excerpt, thanks for that). Congratulations on it's release. -- R
