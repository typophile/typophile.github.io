    though. <BR>Should have mentioned that before, maybe. <BR>Sorry. <BR> <BR>M.

  body: How about <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/modern-no-20/" target="_blank">Modern
    No. 20</a>? This was widely used, in spite of the fact that this is a Bitstream
    font sample at MyFonts.

  body: According to the Mac McGrew book &#39;American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth
    Century&#34;, the Modern style, looking like this dates from the mid-1800&#39;s.
    The Font Book says the face Modern No. 20 originated in 1905 at Stephenson Blake
    in England.

  body: The best guess I can make about that is some of the Numbered Gothic faces,
    such a Gothic No.3 &#40;up to numbers in the hundreds&#41;. Both Monotype and
    Linotype proliferated a wide range of widths and weights of various Gothic &#40;or
    Grotesque&#41; faces. These were being brought into use in the late 1800&#39;s,
    so the timeframe fits your samples easily. To expect all of these to have made
    it into digital form is probably wishful thinking. But you could probably find
    some reasonable &#40;and virtually indistinguishable&#41; versions at MyFonts
    by searching on the terms Gothic Sans or Grotesque. From an ID standpoint you
    are missing some &#40;for me&#41; key letters, like the g, and G, but my impression
    is that some of the <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=FB000020X1P1&amp;start=1"
    target="_blank">Font Bureau &#39;Bureau Grotesque&#39;</a> faces would be pretty
    similar.
