Both EOT and EOT lite &ldquo;seem&rdquo; to do this. The proof is in the pudding though. We will have to see what becomes of the Monotype offer of release of compression sourcecode and the Microsoft offer to release its wrapper. The major browsers need to all be on a level playing field.
As far as type designers go, I wonder what the new deal will do for the hinting regimen.</p>

So the only opportunity that we see for a single web font format across all browsers in the short term is EOT Lite.</p>
<p>We proposed EOT Lite to address the two features of EOT that the browser makers objected to: MTX font compression and URL binding. If the browser makers take up [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009JulSep/0599.html|Monotype&rsquo;s offer for MTX]], then EOT Lite would be an even better solution.</p>
<p>Regardless, EOT Lite provides an achievable solution that would give web designers a single web font format, and access to a large collection of commercial fonts that they desire (and that we want to offer!).</p>

<p>It seems that Monotype is making a great offer to the type comunity, giving MTX compression technology to the public domain. With generous actions like that, everybody wins, I think.</p>
<p>I really hope that Mozilla guys can show their positions in a more clear way at W3C forum. I&rsquo;m spending too much time reading arguments there that seem to be looking for a perfect (impossible) solution. Too platonic for me.</p>
<p>I think the proposals of Ascender (EOT Lite) and Letteror/Typesupply (.webfont 2.1) are much more pragmatic and productive for us all.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Please excuse my self-promotion, but I do think my explanation of the new EOT format is the most concise and easily understandable treatment I&rsquo;ve read so far:<br />
<a href="http://readableweb.com/jeffrey-zeldman-questions-the-eot-lite-web-font-format/"><strong>Jeffrey Zeldman Questions The EOT Lite Web Font Format</strong></a><br />
To bring readers of this site up to date:<br />
So far, even though the new EOT is a reasonable interim solution which would bring web fonts to the most people in the shortest amount of time, the folks from Mozilla FireFox and Opera have said they are &ldquo;not interested&rdquo; in deploying it, despite this one great advantage. I&rsquo;m not sure where Apple stands.<br />
Since it would appear unreasonable to not give reasons for declining to support the new EOT, bullshit reasons have been put forth, in public, in the main forum for these discussions so far, the W3C Web Fonts mailing list.<br />(Don&rsquo;t have the link handy&hellip; anyone?)
Failure to deploy the new EOT means delaying any kind of reliable cross-browser support <strong>for perhaps as long as ten years</strong>.
Please note that there is nothing to prevent a more mature and comprehensive spec such as .webfont or .zot from being developed either alongside or on the heels of an EOT solution.
Me, I guess I&rsquo;ll be boning up on my Adobe Flash skills because the way things are going, that&rsquo;s the only way I&rsquo;ll be able to see what I want to see inside a browser window for the foreseeable future. A shame. Really.</div>

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s resistance to naked font linking isn&rsquo;t supported by technical reasons: it is supported by IP and strategic reasons. As such, it is a much stronger position than the pseudo-technical case that Mozilla and Opera are trying to make against EOT Lite. Microsoft are not trying to invent technical reasons why they won&rsquo;t support naked font linking: they&rsquo;re just stating it as a policy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m delighted to add Dalton Maag to this list.</p>
<p>While we would be happy to offer our support to any format which ticks all the right boxes, EOT Lite is the one which we believe has the highest chance of cross-platform, cross-browser, and cross-device success. And the only realistic proposition for fast roll-out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d also like to see an easy-to-use and thorough subsetting tool (but that applies to font files in general) and ideally opposition to MTX fall - both on grounds of keeping the file compact to deliver real benefits over raw fonts.</p>
<p>If MTX doesn&rsquo;t gain traction, I would advocate an, if you like, extension to EOT Lite which allows the whole content to be compressed using LZMA. Obviously no out-of-the-box IE support for that, but there&rsquo;s no IE support for CFF either, so once it&rsquo;s in the spec, that may come.</p>

This is an elegant solution, combining ZOT&rsquo;s file structure with .webfont&rsquo;s xml metadata file. Worth supporting. So there is EOTL to serve the past and WebOTF for the future.</p>

<p><em>Don’t ever be fooled; unless the format you’re supporting the serving of has Electronic Permissions and Recommendations, being on these support-the-format lists is for the improperly informed, just properly afraid.</em></p>
<p>Since your EP&amp;R proposal is for a font table, it can be included within any wrapper that wraps an sfnt font. The latest WebOTF proposal used the ZOT compression model, which compresses individual tables rather than the whole font, so a tool could efficiently decompress just the EP&amp;R table to check permissions and recommendations, without needing to decompress and load the whole font first.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still far from clear who you think is going to look at this table and what you think they are going to do with the information in it.</p>

The lesson of DTP is that despite the ease of font copying and the lack of punishment for transgression, not to mention the corrupting influence of font bundling and freeware, an indie font industry has emerged based on retail purchases. Please explain how that was possible, and why would things be different for web fonts, or go stand in the corner.</div>

<p>Tough to argue with an &ldquo;existence proof&rdquo;. But if anyone can do it, I believe Mr. Berlow can!
The way things are playing out, with a little bit of luck and, I&rsquo;m assuming, the continued good faith of those parties so far participating, I believe we&rsquo;ll see an outcome similar to the one you describe with DTP, with web fonts.</p>

<p>Typical example of casual misuse of naked font linking: user has a font on his or her system and wants to use it to display text on web page. User has no clue where the font came from or what license terms may apply to it, only that it is available and he or she likes it. So the font is uploaded to a server and linked to as you describe. This is the first casual misuse. The second casual misuse happens when someone writes to that user and says &lsquo;Cool font! Where can I get it?&rsquo; and the first user says &lsquo;Oh, you can download it from my server&rsquo;. The third misuse happens when another user links to the naked font on the server to display text on his own website. The presence of a permissions and recommendations table in the font to which no browser pays any attention and that the user never sees seems to me to have no impact on this scenario.</p>
<p>Now consider the impact of a format distinction between desktop and web fonts: the existing fonts on the user&rsquo;s system are not useful on the web because they don&rsquo;t offer cross-browser interoperability. The user has to either get a new license and a new (customised, serialised, PERM&rsquo;d) font, or has to figure out a way to make a web font. Either way, the very fact that some action is required raises the question &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; which is directly answerable in terms of the existing license agreement. Simply put, the format distinction provides an opportunity to educate the user about the license, which is the distinction between casual and deliberate misuse.</p>

This leads most of the font makers I know to be concerned that naked font linking is basically just an invitation to give away all existing TTF/OTF fonts. Moving forward, with a viable interoperable format and appropriate license metadata etc., font makers can provide web fonts and earn some money from this use, but only if they&rsquo;re not competing against massively widespread unlicensed use of existing desktop fonts on the web.</div>

<p>JH&gt; Typical example of casual misuse of naked font linking: user has a font on his or her system and wants to use it to display text on web page. [etc through 3 examples where obvious &lsquo;nobodies&rsquo;, casually copy, serve and link unlicensed font IP, supposedly because it&rsquo;s &lsquo;naked&rsquo; (OpenType)]</p>
<p>Bought your red herring argument at the red herring argument store?</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s &lsquo;casual users&rsquo; are either Fired by Legal eventually, or they are Nobodies we&rsquo;d never get a license fee from&hellip; ever. All three &lsquo;casual misuse&rsquo; examples are happening soon-as-can-be in another format, just as &ldquo;casually&rdquo;. Users will send each other EOTL. Users will serve each other EOTL, and users will link to fonts on other&rsquo;s servers, in EOTL.</p>
<p>JH&gt;The presence of a permissions and recommendations table in the font to which no browser pays any attention and that the user never sees seems to me to have no impact on this scenario.</p>
<p>If no browser can pay any attention to, and no user can ever see anything from EPAR or metadata of a truly useful nature, ever&hellip; is that the better scenario then?</p>
<p>A lot that was impossible, becomes possible with EPAR, for all formats &lsquo;downstream&rsquo; and as OT is&hellip;</p>
<p>JH&gt;This leads most of the font makers I know to be concerned that naked font linking is basically just an invitation to give away all existing TTF/OTF fonts.</p>
<p>OT is a web font format recommendation of the w3c. If a founder does not have a licensable OT font for the web, and there is nothing else for a developer&rsquo;s browser(s), (for years) what is that an invitation to do?</p>
<p>So&hellip; this fear is not resolved by the means most of the font makers I know are being ponded into. And as you can see, the demonization of EPAR has begun! &ldquo;It will never do anything for anyone ever, so why do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ironically, I said the same a long time ago about any new format, then talked to 100&rsquo;s of clients and types, looked at thousands of types on clients, read a mozillion words from users, developers, permitters and recommendor&rsquo;s, confirmed that no new format will work, and that&rsquo;s how I got to EPAR.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you get here, John? What&rsquo;s your motive? Who do you represent?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

I haven&rsquo;t had a chance yet, but there&rsquo;s been some questions raised as to the reliability of EOTL in those versions. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the CSS syntax or what.
If you see anything amiss in IE6 or 7, please post!

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, I represent me, and I also try to represent fairly and accurately what other people have said to me. So when the great majority of font makers are a) refusing to license for naked font linking and b) vocally supporting distinctive web font formats, I think that should be acknowledged and I&rsquo;m not about to suggest that all those people are idiots who just don&rsquo;t get it or are being ‘ponded’ into a solution, i.e. that they can&rsquo;t figure this out for themselves.</p>
<p><em>Nobodies we’d never get a license fee from.</em></p>
<p>So that makes it okay for them to take your fonts for free? Come on, David, you know the value of typefaces and you know how much of that value resides in either absolute or relative exclusivity. Are your customers going to want to invest in fonts that every ‘nobody’ on the planet might be using on his website? Protecting the customer&rsquo;s investment is job one if we want them to continue spending money on font licenses and commissions.</p>
<p><em>And as you can see, the demonization of EPAR has begun!</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t intend to demonise the EPAR table idea. But when you say things like</p>
<p><em>A lot that was impossible, becomes possible with EPAR</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still left asking What? What?</p>
<p>Maybe you should hire someone to explain this to the rest of us, ’cause you’re doing a lousy job. So far, all you&rsquo;ve done is convince me that you think you&rsquo;re right and everyone else is wrong, but I still don&rsquo;t what you think EPAR makes possible and <em>how</em> it makes it possible.</p>

<p>Hudson says: Maybe you should hire someone to explain this to the rest of us, ’cause you’re doing a lousy job.</p>
<p>Berlow Asks Politely: Will your definition of casual misuse be prevented by a new wrapper, by EOT or any other likely action no win discussion?</p>
<p>Hudson also Asks: I’m still left asking What? What?</p>
<p>Berlow says: There is no point in you going further without Your answer to the question above.</p>
<p>Will John&rsquo;s definition of casual misuse be prevented by a new wrapper? Or will Rocky meet the Squirrel of his dreams?</p>
<p>Stay Tuned!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>None of the web font format proposals do much for casual misuse from one web site to another. This is not for lack of interest by type designers and font vendors, but because the browser makers are simply unwilling to accept anything that does much in that regard.</p>
<p>However, all of these proposals do have some degree of format barrier (garden fence) against casual misuse from as desktop fonts. This is the existing revenue stream that font makers are most worried about losing/threatening/whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily against David Berlow&rsquo;s EPAR table, but I do agree with John that it seems compatible with any other proposal that maintains the existing tables in a font, including WebOTF, EOTL, naked fonts, and just about anything else. However, if David wants to specify that he is really proposing not just &ldquo;add an EPAR table&rdquo; but &ldquo;only naked fonts with an EPAR table,&rdquo; and explain why having an EPAR table inside a dedicated web font format is a Bad Idea, I&rsquo;m all ears.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First off, let me say that I think EOTL sucks and the only reason it is likely to become at least an intermediary interoperable web font format is that it enables foundries who do not want to license for naked font linking, i.e. almost all of them, to immediately start licensing TTF-derived web fonts that will work right now in the majority of browsers in use (IE) and can work tomorrow morning in Firefox etc. as John Daggett has demonstrated with his test code. Part of me wishes EOTL would suck more than it does, so that we could ignore it and concentrate on a better format like .webOTF. But I think we&rsquo;re going to be stuck with EOTL, so the question becomes how to make the most of it.</p>
<p><em>Really the question here is not whether I can explain something, but rather, whether one should support the EOTL format without industry developed meta-data included.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never suggested that that EOTL should be supported without such meta-data, and in all my discussions I have presumed that foundries will be adding such meta-data, either in a standardised table if we can agree on that or in private tables. I do know that things like the EEULAA have been under discussion for at least two years, your EPAR table is currently only an outline of what a table might contain not a technical spec, there is already disagreement in feedback from other foundries about whether all this belongs in a single table or in multiple tables (separate tables for licensing/permissions and for recommendations), standardisation in the OT/OFF spec will take time, and still we&rsquo;re missing the explanation of who is expected to make use of this metadata and how.</p>
<p>I understand some of the things that EPAR makes possible <em>in theory,</em> but I&rsquo;m wondering how you see it working in practical terms. What are the usage scenarios, if this isn&rsquo;t just a bunch of bytes that everyone ignores? [And I don&rsquo;t ask that because I&rsquo;m trying to &lsquo;demonise&rsquo; the EPAR table, but because I&rsquo;ve seen just how keen the browser makers are to ignore anything that implies they have to do something other than or in addition to displaying the linked font. Not to mention the &lsquo;libre&rsquo; font zealots who want to ignore even the rootstrings in existing EOT fonts.]</p>
<p>Re. casual misuse, it&rsquo;s as Thomas says: a distinct format draws a line between fonts used on desktops and fonts used on the web such that a font licensed for use in one environment won&rsquo;t be casually used in the other environment. As I wrote above, the primary concern expressed by multiple font makers is casual misuse of existing desktop fonts on the web, contrary to existing licenses; other forms of casual misuse, including downloading and use of those fonts on the desktop, extend from that first misuse. The question is not, as you suggest, whether parallel kinds of misuse will also apply to EOTL or another web font format, but whether this particular kind of casual misuse of existing fonts can be to some degree prevented, such that the market for web font licensing is viable and font makers trying to sell such licenses are not competing against misuse of their own existing desktop fonts. I believe a format distinction can significantly affect this scenario, and apparently so do most of our colleagues.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m tired of the &ldquo;a web font format won&rsquo;t protect anything&rdquo; meme.</p>
<p>If we want to discourage the use of web fonts on the desktop, there is significance in creating a separate file type. The protection is twofold: First, the user has to confront the problem of &ldquo;getting the font to work&rdquo; on their desktop. This will not guarantee that they understand that they are violating a license, but it increases the likelihood of publicity and awareness of font licensing. (They Google it to find out why it&rsquo;s not working, and find out why.) Second, it&rsquo;s a legal tool, which gives lawyers (in the unlikely event the case goes to court) evidence of a deliberate act. The mere awareness that such an act would make a legal case more convincing in court is a deterrent for some.</p>
<p>Think about the copy protection on most DVDs. With a bit of knowhow, a user can work around it. But the very existence of that copy protection (which, btw, to most people first translates to &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t working when I try to copy it&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;I am not allowed to copy it&rdquo;) subsequently creates awareness of the licensing. If DVDs were easy to copy, I think there would be many more duplicates floating around by now.</p>
<p>So, to summarize, a web font format creates an opportunity for license awareness, and a &ldquo;trail of evidence&rdquo; threat to possible violators. I don&rsquo;t want to overstate the degree to which this helps, but I think it&rsquo;s non-trivial.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of other features which would offer more, and better, protection. URL binding would be nice (but we won&rsquo;t get that). Same-origin checking would be nice (if it could be relied-upon consistently). License info metadata would be nice (and at least is relatively easy to imagine).</p>

<p>The &ldquo;level of safety&rdquo; that type designers are going to get with web fonts is pretty well-settled at this point, right? So, to move on to the question that concerns people like me: does EOTL and .webOTF free things up? Are type designers ready to move on to the next phase?

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David: <em>OpenType is what web fonts are today, working right now in a majority of browsers in use&hellip; (&hellip;and can work tomorrow morning in IE.) </em></p>
<p>This simply isn&rsquo;t true. The majority of browsers in use are IE (approx. 62%, a market share that is falling but will probably remain above 50% for at least another couple of years). In case you missed the memo, Microsoft&rsquo;s rejection of naked font linking in IE appears to be a high level policy decision, i.e. it isn&rsquo;t something that an IE group engineer is just going to reverse. And even if MS were to change their mind about this, IE&rsquo;s version cycle rate is long (approx. 18 months) and its market penetration for new versions is even longer. IE can&rsquo;t do anything by ‘tomorrow morning’, but Firefox have demonstrated that they can (or, at least, sometime next week). [And let&rsquo;s be clear that in terms of market share IE and Firefox are the only two browsers that count. Everything else is a niche product.]</p>
<p>The simple, ugly fact is that EOT is the only web font format supported in the majority of browsers in use, which is precisely why an EOT-derived format looks unavoidable. You should also note that the people pushing most vociferously for EOTL on the W3C list are neither font makers nor browser makers: they&rsquo;re people who make websites. They understand that EOTL is the only option on the table that is already supported in the majority of browsers, is the the only option that doesn&rsquo;t require waiting &gt;18 months for a new IE version, and is the only option that offers a fast route to interoperability.</p>
<p>So I reject your point2 as invalid. Your point3 is debatable, probably endlessly: you think Chris, Thomas and I are wrong (along with most of your other colleagues) and we think you are wrong. But the fact that your point2 is incorrect makes point3 moot. There&rsquo;s going to be a distinct web font format, and I don&rsquo;t see any grounds to think that there won&rsquo;t be. Firefox are busy testing code for both EOTL and .webOTF; they co-developed the proposal for the latter; Microsoft are agreeable to both; font makers have indicated that they are willing to license for one or the other or both. Meanwhile, MS has said no to naked font linking in no uncertain terms, font makers have said they will not license for it, and it is dead-in-the-water as an interoperable format.</p>
<p><em>point1 We need to put meta data in existing open and published font format.</em></p>
<p>Quite probably. But I&rsquo;m still waiting for your explanation of <em>how</em> this helps, in practical terms, of what kind of scenarios you envision in which this data is used.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point in trying to draw a useful line through three points if one of those points is factually incorrect and another is open to reasonable disagreement. But one only needs two points to make a line, so why don&rsquo;t we consider the two realistic points:</p>
<p>a) There is going to be a distinct web font format</p>
<p>b) There is meta data that needs to travel in or with a font</p>

<p>However, a two-format appeals to me as a font manufacturer because I will be able to produce and market two kinds of OpenType font: one (.otf) for print and online display in bitmapped gif/png/jpeg files, that will be feature rich&ndash;and another (.eotl) that will have fewer features but more nuanced screen hinting.</p>
<p>Also, the licensing would be different, prohibiting using the .otf format online, or adapting web-format fonts from the .otf fonts.</p>
<p>Having different file format suffixes is a good way to signal the different capabilites and licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Sure, OpenType features such as small caps and figure alternates are web-viable, but I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a market for that yet.</p>

<p>No, I do not. In fact, WebOTF is attractive because it has made a very clear allowance for it by design. But I should add that I&rsquo;m still digesting the proposals, and there&rsquo;s no particular Adobe position on it yet.

<p>do you think you could clarify what &ldquo;support&rdquo; means? If it means that Adobe supports the discussion, which is what I inferred from your post at the top of this thread (#3), would it be fair to say that Adobe also supports webOTF?</p>

<p>Yes, particularly since it is something that is a maturation of preceding proposals. As you would probably guess, there is a pretty substantial leap between concepts and models that Adobe supports (by discussion) and business decisions it makes. This is not to say they&rsquo;re unrelated, but that there are a lot of meetings and tests which precede the latter. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hmmm. Thanks for the excellent input guys!</p>
<p>To revise: point2 - OpenType is not going away, as a DeskTop format. It is not being replaced as a Web format or by a Web format. OpenType is what web fonts are all deriving from now, and most likely for a generation, for all browsers.</p>
<p>To not revise point3 - a new web format will not prevent casual misuse. Users will do everything with the new format they did with OpenType. In most cases, OT web font users will not even know the difference, simply pointing to OT fonts on disk and never seeing resulting .web font files.</p>
<p>John, you have been drawing an imaginary line with words, &ldquo;simply a new format will protect&rdquo;. I say you are wrong, and am drawing the line in the OT font ahead of this nonsense. I have been on the right side, at the right time, for the format changes from Paper to Bitmap to Ikarus to PostScript to TrueType to OpenType. I have never been so accountable.</p>
<p>Because founders were not given a choice between these EOT, and whether to just add metadata to OT, and license that, they now are faced with two bad choices, (or one excellent good non-choice). Why? Because MS doesn&rsquo;t support their own format, and when it was &lsquo;our turn&quot; to add to that format, well it wasn&rsquo;t our turn. So long and thanks for the petite caps?</p>
<p>And maybe because John says (to people who don&rsquo;t know better), things like ;
&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re looking for is a format that is interoperable in terms of widespread browser support [good] and suitability to various kinds of licensing, rather than suitability only to free licensing [bad boy].&rdquo;</p>
<p>CS reprise&gt;To be honest, I’m tired of the “a web font format won’t protect anything” meme.</p>
<p>But Chris, that is why we are here. MS &lsquo;said&rsquo;  &ldquo;Our OT format is Raw, as a web font format, won’t protect anything and is not improvable by us, or anyone else.&rdquo; (although I will never get the memo). And John says OT as a web font is Naked, suited only to free licensing. ;)</p>
<p>So once again I am doing the &lsquo;right thing&rsquo;. Because there is an us in users, we are putting meta data in our OT fonts. Though I am not working alone on this I can only speak for myself and say, I am looking at near-omega lists and post-alpha tools.</p>
<p>We will be putting this meta data into our fonts in the early fall. This meta data and the tools that read it, will address outstanding and new licensing issues, initially. Later, when it can demonstrated to the <em>interested</em>, much more interesting uses will come forth.</p>
<p>The only other brief brief I&rsquo;ll give you all, is that those who support the EPAR and its meta data, do so <em>entirely</em> without a herd to embolden them. Those who oppose the addition of this data to the OpenType format, might just say <em>anything</em> going forward. So, Heads-Up and My Advice is to follow those who &ldquo;are accountable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>P.S. Chris, after this little tempest, the dedicated web font development community has to go on to repairing the latin readability meme-plex in low resolution screen typography, so you&rsquo;ll get clearer definition of a meme then. As this is &lsquo;the heart of the letter&rsquo;, the beta presentation of this will be at ATypI. You who&rsquo;ve been present here over the years, know the alpha.</p>

<p>John - the following paints a very wrong picture:</p>
<p>“[And let’s be clear that in terms of market share IE and Firefox are the only two browsers that count. Everything else is a niche product.]”</p>
<p>Just because a browser’s share of market is below a certain percentage doesn’t mean it’s not going to figure into the equation when a web site’s creators decide on using web fonts or not.
There is a strong, strong pull towards authoring for the lowest common denominator (at the cost of not providing a superior, optimal experience for those using more recent and capable browsers - a philosophy I’ve always found frustating.)
In this respect, Safari is no niche product. If web fonts can’t be delivered to Mac users, many sites will pass on it until they can.
Similarly, Chrome hasn’t got any market share worth talking about but because it’s a Google product and has a higher share among developers, what it does and doesn’t support has a far greater impact than it’s numbers would suggest.
Should Firefox support EOTL and .webOTF, that will be a very, very influential factor for the developers of Safari and Chrome. (IMHO)
Itty bitty Opera (which really is a niche product in every sense) has already signaled it has no choice but to follow where Firefox (and IE) lead.
But Safari is a big problem. Until they sign on to these formats, web fonts are still a very iffy proposition for web devs.
Those who manage web sites - especially shopping sites where dollars are on the line - have an almost irrational fear of leaving users behind. Damn near phobic.
Site managers will tend to shy away from new techniques far longer than it is rational for them to do so.</p>

<em> To not revise point3 - a new web format will not prevent casual misuse</em></p>
<p>A new web format <em>will</em> prevent casual misuse, but it will not protect against a deliberate act of misuse – this is very important difference. 
Bringing back a “garden fence” analogy – once in a lifetime everyone of us may find oneself trespassing on someone’s private property if the property has no signs and no fence around it. Simply posting the sign “no trespassing”, or putting a fence that can be easily jumped would prevent many people from trespassing. And I absolutely agree with Christopher Slye that a simple fact that web font format is different from one used on a desktop would require people to do something to web fonts to get them to work on a desktop. Many will stop right there and do nothing, some will be curious enough to find out why web fonts are not working on a desktop and what needs to be done to make them work – I am sure many will choose to not do it when they learn what they wanted to know. As a result, a web font format will significantly reduce casual misuse, and will require an informed decision for someone who is going to commit a deliberate act of converting a web font into a desktop format.</p>
<p><em>point1 We need to put meta data in existing open and published font format </em></p>
<p>I agree, but this is something we can do today, without anybody’s permission. What I particularly like about WebOTF proposal is that it offers opportunity for extensible metadata. There can be many reasons for this to be useful, and there can be many circumstances when the metadata included in the existing font may need to be different from what you want web users to see. For this reason (and compression, and other things) I have no doubt that WebOTF is a better long-term alternative to EOT-Lite.</p>
<p>On EOT-Lite:
I agree that EOTL is not an ideal solution, and we do not have much flexibility in defining what EOTL is, because of the backward compatibility with legacy IE implementations. However, it’s this very compatibility that makes it an attractive short-term solution, one that can bring web fonts to authors and all web users <em>today</em> and make web fonts a market reality for all of us tomorrow. Web authors are our potential customers, I don’t see why we should tell them to wait another five years before we can agree on (and develop implementations for) an ideal solution. Rather, I would give them something they (and I) can live with today, and present them with much better solution five years from now. I am sure that it will benefit everybody – I consider EOTL a full-scale web font trial that will provide us with valuable feedback.</p>

Vlad</p>

<p>“<em>I consider EOTL a full-scale web font trial that will provide us with valuable feedback.</em>”</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing this opinion. (This is one aspect of EOTL that&rsquo;s occurred to me and I&rsquo;ve hesitated to write about it because I thought it might be construed as a bit of a reach. But I guess I&rsquo;m not alone.)
I absolutely agree. What deployment of EOTL <strong>is going to teach us about web fonts</strong> - implementors, web designers, web devs, type designers, all of us - is tons more valuable than years of debate and best-guesstimates at the W3C could ever give us. That we can so easily take an existing real-world solution and expand it to reach so many users in so short a time is a great stroke of luck in that regard.
One hell of a trial run, indeed.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rich</p>

<p>But, David, as far as I know <em>no one</em> is opposing the addition of meta data to the OT format, at least in principle. There&rsquo;s going to be plenty of debate about what that meta data should contain and how it should be structured, but I think you&rsquo;ll find most font makers supportive of the idea.</p>
<p>EPAR is not being opposed; rather, you&rsquo;ve been asked two questions, neither of which you have answered:</p>
<p>My question: How do you see EPAR practically being used, i.e. in what kind of scenarios do you see this data being accessed and what actions result?</p>
<p>Thomas' question: do you think that ‘having an EPAR table inside a dedicated web font format is a Bad Idea’ and if so why?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Users will do everything with the new format they did with OpenType.</em></p>
<p>And some new things too. As explained multiple times by multiple people: a distinct format is a barrier to casually doing those new things to existing OpenType fonts. this is what various foundries have indicated that they want to protect against: widespread, casual and unthinking use of existing TTF and OTF fonts as web fonts, so that when entering the web font market they don&rsquo;t have to compete against unlicensed use of their own products.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>An excellent observation.</p>
<p>Vlad&gt;A new web format <em>will</em> prevent casual misuse, but it will not protect against a deliberate act of misuse – this is [a] very important difference.</p>
<p>Most users have never served a font. So&hellip; if doing something entirely new is not a deliberate act, I&rsquo;m not sure what is &ldquo;a very important difference&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Most users have never converted a font. So&hellip; if doing something entirely new is not a deliberate act, I&rsquo;m not sure what is&hellip; either.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thomas’ question: do you think that ‘having an EPAR table inside a dedicated web font format is a Bad Idea’ and if so why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I assume by &lsquo;dedicated web font format&rsquo; you mean a font format intended exclusively to be served by file name at the ends of urls, to user&rsquo;s machines with full interoperability, a format devoted to being served via linking?</p>
<p>It depends on the format. In the case of EOT, I have consistently expressed that if the font format is called, Embeddable OpenType, then the EPAR inside could say that the font is not for embedding, I won&rsquo;t support that. The format is dedicated to linking served fonts to described contents, and we have enough educational problems left from this font war. Also, as expressed much earlier, if this dedicated font format uses &lsquo;meta-data&rsquo; intended for the permitting of actual embedding, I would not like to support it&rsquo;s repurposing of that meta-data for serving or linking permissions &hellip; at all.</p>
<p>If these things are solved, and if MS doesn&rsquo;t want EPAR in OT, but it&rsquo;s arms&rsquo;re open to EPAR in EOT or EOTL, why not? But then again, does that make sense to you?</p>
<p>As for the other font format proposal, how would anybody know that having an EPAR table inside would be good? But&hellip; if I hear &ldquo;let&rsquo;s do this .webfont conversion thing, take it to the streets ASAP, and then add whatever into this marvelous extendable format&rdquo; I&rsquo;d be against that. We have a marvelous extendable format, and that must be the source of all of the new format with exception perhaps of some point-of-license microdata. Otherwise, there will so much expense in this, no one will like it.</p>
<p>So, as EOT stands, there are two things in the way? As .webfonts stands, there&rsquo;s nothing in the way yet? But they both stand in the way of OT, which is not going away.</p>
<p>John, I know the question. I&rsquo;m gathering time. &ldquo;Casual misuse&rdquo; was introduced . . . &ldquo;unthinking use of existing TTF and OTF fonts&rdquo; and &ldquo;only freely licenable&rdquo; &hellip;it all takes so much time. :-)</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s in a name? I agree that it would make no sense to call something &lsquo;Embeddable&rsquo; and at the same time have a table in the font, or even simply the license agreement in the name table, say that the font is not embeddable. It would confuse people. But EOT was never short for &ldquo;Embeddable OpenType&rdquo;, it has always been short for &lsquo;<em>Embedded</em> OpenType&quot;, and if a font is embedded but the tables say it must not be embedded then that isn&rsquo;t confusing at all: it&rsquo;s a clear violation.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that EOT Lite is only a working name, and various people on the W3C list, not least Håkon Lie, have already insisted that if this proposal is to become a recommended format then the name must be changed to something that does not reference EOT, so as to avoid confusion and to avoid the suggestion that browsers supporting &lsquo;whatever EOTL will end up being called&rsquo; need to do something, anything with EOT files.</p>
<p>So maybe its helpful to think not in terms of EOTL but instead of a distinctly named similar format that happens to be backwards compatible with EOT support in IE.</p>
<p><em>Also, as expressed much earlier, if this dedicated font format uses ’meta-data’ intended for the permitting of actual embedding, I would not like to support it’s repurposing of that meta-data for serving or linking permissions &hellip; at all.</em></p>
<p>The terms &lsquo;embedding&rsquo; and &lsquo;linking&rsquo; are used confusedly and interchangeably and without clear definition. This is why no one seems quite sure whether the OS/2 embedding bits relate to web use in any way; apparently they were originally conceived of as relating to such use, but now seem to imply something quite different, despite Microsoft historical use of &lsquo;embedded&rsquo; in the context of web linked EOT files. And then there is embedding within an application or a game, etc., whether online or on disc, and that is quite different from document embedding or web linking. Terminologically, its a mess.</p>
<p><em>If these things are solved, and if MS doesn’t want EPAR in OT, but it’s arms’re open to EPAR in EOT or EOTL, why not? But then again, does that make sense to you?</em></p>
<p>Is this what you&rsquo;ve heard from anyone at MS? I can sort of imagine the argument that adding EPAR to OT implies possible widespread system and application updates to do something (what?) with that data, whereas if EPAR is limited to a specifically web font format then only browsers are, possibly, on the hook to do something (what?) with the data. That looks to me like the kind of MS argument I&rsquo;m familiar with.</p>
<p><em>We have a marvelous extendable format, and that must be the source of all of the new format with exception perhaps of some point-of-license microdata.</em></p>
<p>I basically agree with that, and I think a distinction between font level metadata and &lsquo;point-of-license&rsquo; microdata is probably a useful one, given that it looks like we&rsquo;re going to need criteria to determine what belongs in font data and what belongs at the header level.</p>
<p>But you are going to have to move <em>Real Fast</em> if you want EPAR to be into OT/OFF before an interoperable web font format is becomes a reality. The browser makers have got it into their heads to come up with an interoperable solution to using more fonts on the web, and the factors pushing them &ndash; <em>and the degree to which they are pushing each other</em> &ndash; are well outside of the control of font makers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, the point about the vulnerability of existing desktop fonts to use as web fonts, due to ignorance of licensing terms, was made by Christopher during the pre-panel meeting at TypeCon, and I believe Ivo and others concurred. I think it is a valid concern, and in some respects more immediate than the casual and unthinking use of web fonts as desktop fonts. Without the format distinction, there isn&rsquo;t really any such thing as a web font: there is just a desktop font being used on the web and then downloaded and used on someone else&rsquo;s desktop, and without any way of telling where the font came from.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David: <em>Does this ’backward compatibility’ still include ambiguously ’web serving’ fonts permitted by founders only for embedding in a document?</em></p>
<p>Backwards compatibility means that a newly defined web font format with the same file header and fontdata arrangement as an EOT font and a recognised <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_%28programming%29">magic number</a> will be displayed in IE6, IE7 and IE8 using existing EOT handling. Because the newly defined format is specifically a format for web font linking, it shouldn&rsquo;t be used for any font that is only licensed for embedding in a document. Where&rsquo;s the issue?</p>
<p>Historically, there&rsquo;s a terminological and practical disconnect that renders the OT embedding bits virtually meaningless. The EOT spec relates them specifically to font linking on the web, only refers to such linking as embedding and to linked fonts as embedded fonts: <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/EOT/#EmbeddingLevel"><em>Applications that implement support for font embedding must not embed fonts which are not licensed to permit embedding. Further, applications loading embedded fonts for temporary use (see Preview &amp; Print and Editable embedding below) must delete the fonts from the device when the document containing the embedded font is closed.</em></a> Sure, terminologically it is confused, but this was the spec for a font file format specifically intended for linking in web pages using @font-face: &lsquo;embedding&rsquo; in this context can only mean web linking.</p>
<p>But in the long period during which EOT was largely ignored by font makers and web designers (outside of complex script countries), the embedding bits came to be associated with document embedding rather than web linking, to such an extent that the browsers now implementing naked font linking feel justified in simply ignoring the embedding bits entirely as if they have—and have never had—any relevance to web font linking.</p>
<p>This is where, theoretically, something like EPAR comes in, to clarify what the embedding bits now only obscure or confuse. But <em>if</em> the existing embedding bits had retained in peoples' minds their EOT-specified relationship to web linking, and <em>if</em> the Monotype vs. Adobe court decision over PDF embedding had not determined that these bits did not constitute a technological protection under the terms of the DMCA, <em>then</em> I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d see any naked font linking of TTF and OTF fonts, because the non-IE browser makers have indicated that they refuse to get involved in any enforcement that might make them liable under DMCA, and more generally just don&rsquo;t want to get involved in anything that looks like rights/permissions management. In other words, naked font linking is only possible for them because they consider the embedding bits completely ignorable.</p>
<p>So this is why I&rsquo;m wondering how EPAR is supposed to affect any of this? It seems to me that either EPAR is ignorable, in which case these browsers will ignore it as they ignore the embedding bits, or it is not ignorable, in which case they will refuse to touch fonts that contain it, as they refuse to touch EOT fonts that contain rootstrings.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Whew! So ask a simple question&hellip;</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s answer, is that EOT cannot be changed, (except to provide less protection as the &lsquo;other&rsquo; browser-makers see fit). So if one browser maker (MS) wants to repurpose our permissions, and the rest want to ignore them completely, we have to make sure a competent and dedicated format is developed so users at least can be informed if they choose.</p>
<p>Maybe EPAR is ignorable, designed that way to suit the needs of browsers, but it is apparently without competition in this area, and as such, it is already irreplaceable.</p>
<p>From the EOT spec:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;There exists a need for a mechanism to allow people who have licensed the font for use with their documents a way to also use the font for their web content without violating the EULA agreement which they have accepted.&rdquo; </strong></p>
<p>EOT is not only not solving this problem: it makes a single permission, into a double permission, without permission.</p>
<p>So my position remains that without having one permission (at LEAST), dedicated exclusively to &ldquo;serving&rdquo;, a font format is not a web font format.</p>
<p>EOT was made as a PDF competitor. Precisely because it failed to do that, I&rsquo;d rather not allow it to become a killer of PDF font embedding. It&rsquo;s not really good at anything, and that&rsquo;s why we ignored it John.</p>
<p>This week, let&rsquo;s count actual heads on this.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, why are you talking about EOT?</p>
<p>EOT is irrelevant. We&rsquo;re not talking about licensing fonts for EOT, we&rsquo;re talking about licensing fonts for new formats, one of which has the practical benefit of being recognised by EOT implementations in existing IE browsers. From a licensing perspective, its something distinct from EOT, and hence what EOT did or did not permit isn&rsquo;t an issue. You specify in your license agreement for the new format web fonts what is allowed and what is is not allowed, and the fact that it is a new format clarifies the scope of the license agreement, i.e. the license applies to this file format, not to any other.</p>
<p>Among the points agreed by the browser makers on the W3C list is that under ‘EOT Lite’ implementation</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the new EOTL fonts will need to be recognisably distinct from EOTC (‘EOT classic’) fonts, such that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EOTL fonts will be backwards compatible with EOTC handling in IE7–8 but EOTC fonts will <em>not</em> be forwards compatible with EOTL handling in browsers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There&rsquo;s also generally agreement that EOTL should be renamed in some way that does not reference EOT, specifically so that browsers are not led to believe that they need to do anything with existing EOTC fonts.</p>

<p>The Cufón &ldquo;system&rdquo; uses one Javascript file to perform swaps with HTML tags (&lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, etc.), and separate Javascript files contain the font data.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, I linked to the EOT spec in order to point out that the OS/2 embedding bits were explicitly specified in terms of what we now call web linking, not document embedding. You can say that EOT incorrectly interprets these embedding bits as permitting web linking, but one could just as easily say that font makers have incorrectly interpreted them as permitting document embedding as something distinct from web linking. Best, perhaps, to say that the embedding bits were poorly and ambiguously specified in both the OT and EOT specs.</p>
<p>I think this ambiguity should be addressed in the new EOT-derived web font format. But how to do this? The easiest way would be to simply state that the OS/2 embedding bits are irrelevant to web linking in the new format, and should be taken neither as permission to link nor as denial of permission. In other words, for the purpose of web linking, these bits are ignorable. This is easiest because it is what the non-IE browsers are already doing with regard to embedding bits in naked font linking.</p>
<p>How about if the text of the EOTL proposal is changed to specify that the embedding bits are not indicative of permitting web font linking, and that fonts should only be converted to EOTL &ndash; i.e. whatever it ends up being called &ndash; if the license explicitly permits this. Does that resolve the problem? So long as the <em>functional</em> compatibility of EOTL, i.e. the ability of these new format fonts to function like EOT in IE6–8, is not affected (because that would render the format pointless), there is nothing in the EOTL proposal that isn&rsquo;t open to revision.</p>

<p>Agreed. What&rsquo;s in a name, you asked? What sin a name, I answer. TrueType became TrueType Open, became OpenType, became Open Font Format (did I miss TrueOpen, somewhere).

<p>Thomas&gt; John: Your proposal sounds reasonable to me.</p>
<p>Funny, so did &lsquo;your&rsquo; proposal of around 2002, Thomas, to use these bits for document embedding permissions. Actually, we had no choice, PDF was a loaded gun, put to our heads, and founders were &lsquo;given&rsquo; an offer we couldn&rsquo;t refuse. But it must seem funny now to someone.</p>
<p>I, at least however, went on stage, and gave a presentation called, &ldquo;Email; Type into the breach&rdquo;. I said we were missing a mechanism. Now, I can&rsquo;t wait anymore for the names to be straightened out, I&rsquo;m doin' it myself.</p>

Not with this. Pawns on a chessboard we are, for sure.

<p>That said, there are decisions to be made regarding font-linking. It&rsquo;s been reported that Font Bureau is going to be offering web font licenses shortly. True?</p>

<p>I agree. My concern now is that since EOTL seems to be moving toward at least interim support as an interoperable web font format <em>whether we like it or not,</em> it should not, in your words, get in the way of something like EPAR. So I want to figure out how to revise the EOTL proposal such that the ambiguity over embedding bit meaning is removed. And the best way to do that seems to be to explicitly state that the embedding bits should <em>not</em> be regarded as either permitting or denying web font linking, i.e. that they should be ignored for this purpose. This seems to me to suit everyone: it gives the okay to the non-IE browsers to do what they are going to do anyway, while removing the ambiguity that causes concern to font makers, and pointing users toward the license agreement rather than possible misinterpretation of the embedding bits. Does this make sense to you, David? Is this something I can usefully push on the W3C list as a means to ensure that EOTL doesn&rsquo;t get in your way?</p>

<p>@David: At the time, in 2002, it seemed more reasonable to use the embedding bits to determine Acrobat behavior than to just let Acrobat embed any and all fonts.

Almost all foundries were okay with preview/print embedding, while form field fill-out and more exotic options were pretty far from commonplace in PDF at the time.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick&gt; David, I’ve found it useful to upgrade my typefaces as OpenType (.otf).</p>
<p>Yeah, granted, but the same upgraded-ness could be signified by saying your new fonts were TT4 vs. TT3.</p>
<p>Rich &gt;&hellip;Font Bureau is going to be offering web font licenses shortly. True?</p>
<p>In essence, clients willing today to choose the format recognized by the majority of browsers, may get a custom licensed web font to serve, but only during business hours can the &lsquo;shortly&rsquo; occur.</p>
<p>Thomas&gt; I don’t think that was much of a gun at anybody’s head&hellip;it seemed more reasonable to use the embedding bits to determine Acrobat behavior than to just let Acrobat embed any and all fonts.</p>
<p>Thomas&hellip; I switched the sentence order, that&rsquo;s all. You were saying? ;)</p>
<p>So that being said, I think I should change the discussion vector slightly.</p>
<p>John&gt; It must be a chaturanga board, because there are definitely more than two players. :)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just 2-d.</p>
<p>John&gt;  the point he has just raised on the W3C list should be given some attention&hellip;</p>
<p>Font families, is one of about, 30 points, in my opinion. Nearly each and every category of the developing EPAR table, will need a subset of a working group working on it. It&rsquo;s just 30-d.</p>
<p>My understanding has always been that this discussion was towards the formation of a W3C working group on fonts (better perhaps on typography). We have too many formats, and not enough reasons for them.</p>
<p>John&gt; I want to figure out how to revise the EOTL proposal such that the ambiguity over embedding bit meaning is removed. And the best way to do that seems to be to explicitly state that the embedding bits should not be regarded as either permitting or denying web font linking, i.e. that they should be ignored for this purpose.</p>
<p>I think the best way is to remove the format, not ignore it&rsquo;s parts. A standard format should not have additional &lsquo;features&rsquo; hidden by lack of documentation, or documented to be unused. Layering ambiguity does not help. Some tests are being run on this with us and Ascender.</p>
<p>John&gt;&hellip;it gives the okay to the non-IE browsers to do what they are going to do anyway,</p>
<p>No different than if they were using OT.</p>
<p>John&gt; Does this make sense to you, David?</p>
<p>What makes sense to me, is that EOT is no longer dressed to solve the problem for which MS proposed it. So, I don&rsquo;t think it is a good candidate for temp or full time employment into the future.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know from MS, how to revise <em>their OT spec</em> to suit their needs, regardless of how expensive they want me to get in revising <em>their OT font format</em>. What would it take? if they continue to say NO, then I&rsquo;m done, because OT is not going away from the desktop, or the web, so it&rsquo;s the new gun to our heads and no one can change that position, we can only change what&rsquo;s in the chamber. That&rsquo;s my plan, that&rsquo;s been my plan, that remains my plan.</p>
<p>I do appreciate how hard you too are working this problem.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>See, we disagree about this. Microsoft have already changed that position by saying that naked font linking will not be supported in IE, which means it won&rsquo;t be an option for most browser users. At that point, it hardly matters whether the other browsers support it or not, because a non-interoperable web font format is not a web font format with any future. The non-IE browser makers appear to understand this, which is why they are busy testing code for both EOTL and WebOTF.</p>
<p>Because of the compatibility benefit of EOTL, I&rsquo;d say that this is very much the gun to our heads at the moment or, rather, the gun currently being pushed with the most pressure. So I think it is important to get it as clean as possible, to avoid infection if the gun goes off. :)</p>

<p>Maybe! But then again, maybe MS just likes the networked user, is not involved in the world wide web the same way as others and that sticks out as time goes by, even more than it has on this issue.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David: <em>So a developer would have to read the font specification in order to learn how to legally font serve? Yum!</em></p>
<p>No, the web developer reads the EULA or, maybe one day, has an EPAR reading tool that tells him whether a font may be legally served on the web. The point of making an explicit statement re. embedding bits in the format spec is to make it <em>legally</em> unambiguous that these bits are not to be taken by user agents, font conversion tools etc. as permitting web linking for fonts.</p>
<p>Actually, the more I think about this, the less it appears to be in any way limited to an EOT-derived format: the ambiguity of the possible interpretation of embedding bits is an OT problem and affects any use of fonts on the web, including TTF/OTF. Simply adding an EPAR table without clarifying the status of the embedding bits doesn&rsquo;t resolve this ambiguity: it just adds the possibility of embedding bits and EPAR fields being contradictory.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a suggestion for a two-pronged clarification:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Revise text re. embedding bits in the OT spec to make clear what is and is not meant by &lsquo;document embedding&rsquo;. State that embedding bits henceforth do not apply to web linking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revise the text re. embedding bits in the EOTL proposal to explicitly state that embedding bits do not apply to web linking. [I still think this is necessary, even if the OT spec is revised, because this interpretation of embeddding bits is directly contrary to the old EOT spec, and hence needs to be explicit in the new format proposal.]</p>
</li>

<p>Umm, no. My sources tell me the aim is to create a defacto standard with, at least, Mozilla and MSFT on board. A working group would, hopefully, follow. Certain W3C members have made it clear that they have no interest in going down this path. No matter how common-sensical and beneficial to end users it might be.
This gibes with my overall impression of the situation as it&rsquo;s evolved, as well.</p>

<p>The same is true for every vendor that claims to &ldquo;support&rdquo; WOFF. AFAIK no one has clarified what &ldquo;support&rdquo; means for any of the vendors on the supporters list. I think it&rsquo;s valid to ask everyone what support means, not just Monotype - hence the unfair comment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First of all, to make things clear (again ;) - nothing has changed in my position wrt WebOTF/WOFF. I liked this technology back then (<a href="http://typophile.com/node/60220#comment-361492)">http://typophile.com/node/60220#comment-361492)</a>, and I still like it today. 
The reason for my post was the realization that the list of foundries maintained by Tiffany (<a href="http://tr.im/sF8B">http://tr.im/sF8B</a>) didn&rsquo;t mention Monotype, and I figured I should make it clear. We do support WOFF in the same context as it&rsquo;s defined on that page: &ldquo;The term “support” is understood to be general approval of the proposal and its intentions, not an exclusive commitment to it, or a formal endorsement of it.&rdquo;</p>
