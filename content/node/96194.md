    heart and an ampersand are also available. That said, it would not be difficult
    (or illegal) for someone to create a caps-only (maybe with small caps) display
    font. \r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n"

  body: "Hrant - I don't know  the terms of the Kontour Type Foundry's EULA, but I'll
    bet that it was much less expensive for Swarovski to design their own cake topper
    metal letter than to license Odile (or any other appropriate set of initials).
    \ I'd also imagine that the constraints and economics of metal fabrication  played
    a big part in their design considerations.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
