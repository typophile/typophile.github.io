body: "I will provided the \"Question of the Week\" and give my answer. I hope in
  return, you share your answers.\r\n\r\nQ: Who would win a fight, Batman or Ironman?\r\n\r\nA:
  My money would be on Ironman. The guy can fly or jet around. Batman? He needs his
  vehicle and he can only glide, technically can't fly.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

  body: Batman can do super-precision kerning in the dark, but Ironman has the raw
    materials to potentially mold his own fonts. Hard one.
