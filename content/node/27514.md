  the past, and found that bugs in it caused my system to mess up. I've also used
  Font Agent Pro and it was ok but found it to be bothersome at times, so currently
  just using font book. I was curious to know what others used, and how it worked
  out for them."

    9 did.

  body: "I've dabbled with all the usual culprits, but starting out in a new job where
    they had no money for any font management software I thought IU'd give Explorer
    a whirl. Having used it for a couple of months now I can happily report I've been
    pleasantly surprised by its robustness, reliability and general features. Not
    to mention the appealing UI.\r\n\r\nActivation is quick (although I think Fontagent
    seemed a little more responsive at times), organising fonts within the structure
    is intuitive and its handling of system fonts also seems refreshingly sensible.
    Most importantly for me it seems to be able to preview large lists of fonts with
    ease (something that suitcase always seemed to struggle with). Its worth noting
    I'm working with a small font library ... nothing gargantuan and litho-house-esque,
    but overall I'm amazed at the quality of a product like this for the price ;)
    so much so on reinstalling my home machine recently it was the app I opted for
    there as well."
