<div class=commentbody> (The poignant thing seems to be that it took "Just Hranting" almost two days to compose that dubious response.) <br> <br>I find myself agreeing with Hrant on this one. When readers (especially those ignorant or indifferent to linguistics and elements of typographic excellence) are constantly fed inferior product, they tend to become conditioned to accept it as the norm. <br> <br>While we may indeed "read best what we read most," it doesn't change the probability that we might read "even better" what is carefully designed to streamline and capitalize on the science and psychology behind human comprehension. <br> <br>"Just Hranting [et al]"'s rants seem to be attempting to prove the point that we can make sense out of what s/he is typing in his/her childish misspellings and errors. Indeed we can decipher them, but I don't think anyone would seriously argue that his/hers is the best way to communicate. <br> <br>(Or, perhaps more likely, given recent posts, I'm giving him/her too much credit, and s/he is simply lashing out childishly.) <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody> Didn't morrison once said: 'if typography has been done well, the reader won't notice it'. Isn't that the whole point/dilemma we have as typedesigners? If we put to much charateristics into a typeface, to make it recognizable for example, readability often suffers. <br> <br>On top of that: <br>I once had a discussion my grandpa about the need of new typefaces and typography. His answer was *Why bother?* <br>Isn't that an important point as well? People prefer taking the way with the least of friction, commercialization is making the mass lazy and indifferent. <br>Why buy fonts, if you have 20 preinstalled? <br>Or: if people have to read stuff, they will read and buy it! Even if its giving them a headache because of the bad typography and it looks so &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;, you wouldn't even wipe your arse with it? (newsletter, technical books e.g.). <br> <br>But, I must be honest, I wouldn't know how re-educate the mass! Even if Apple, Micro$ and Linux (to name the big ones) would preinstall our favorite 10 typefaces, would the standard reader tell the difference? And after 1 year those 10 faces will have been used so often, that most type designers will discuss about the same topic as we do now.......again. <br> <br>Is this maybe an endless discussion? <br> <br>Jacques <br> <br>Ps: please don't think I'm a fatalistic guy. I will design type till I drop, even if people don't buy them. Its all your head... </div>

<div class=commentbody> > if typography has been done well, the reader won't notice it <br> <br>That's not 100% true (but what is?...): <br>1. There are different layers of transparency, and those who take the Morison doctrine too seriously only see one layer, and as a result they think that something is either readable, or worthless. For one thing, there is a difference between the conscious appreciation versus the subconscious effects of type. <br>2. It's not inconceivable that a reader can consciously appreciate a letterform, and this could add to the experience*. Yes, this ruins immersion during reading, but immersion isn't everything. <br> <br>* And reading -like anything else humans do- is an experience, not just some data-collection task. Tasks are for computers. <br> <br>> *Why bother?* <br> <br>Good question. Increasingly, type design is about personal satisfaction, not some glorious role in society. <br> <br>> would the standard reader tell the difference? <br> <br>Not consciously (and in part, they shouldn't anyway). But the intelligent graphic designer knows the value of new fonts, or fonts with particular "moods". <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> I think appropriateness belongs in this discussion as well. IMO Times had its appropriate place in time, a v. definite reason for existence. But now that we print on a much more refined newsprint that can hold a much finer serif perhaps Times Roman has had its day. Does that mean it is now a 'poor' design? Perhaps my thoughts are too random. </div>

<div class=commentbody> > Does that mean [Times] is now a 'poor' design? <br> <br>I'm fond of saying that a design is only truly good for an instant in time. <br> <br>Of course that's an over-simplification, but it's just as true as claiming that some designs are eternal. <br> <br>What makes the evaluation of a typeface over time very tricky is the unavoidable role of the technology/medium. For example, Times was great for its original target reproduction conditions, but when its digital form is printed today, it might look OK on a laser printer (with the associated "ink" gain), but in high-quality offset it's too light, and too contrasty. So, which one do we judge? <br> <br>In the end, we end up having to ask: what *is* Times? Is it the collection of all the versions of it (ignoring for the moment the naming issues), or is it a necessarily nebulous *concept* that -to some degree- has to be evaluated irrespective of any instance(s)? <br> <br>hhp </div>

I don't know any type designer that isn't fluent in their own language and that of typography - they couldn't do that job otherwise. Considering the colision of likely letter pairs isn't really an issue, because type designers consider *all* letter pairs (ie you make up test sheets of all posible combinations, which in the age of the intercap would include cap-lower-cap sets). <br> <br>The only linguistics that may come into this process are whether a certain pair may be "useful" or whether a ligature is worth making (ie fffl does occur in German, but because of the grammar/structure used wouldn't be set as a four character ligature). <br> <br>That's for Western European Roman anyway. Where designers are unfamiliar with accented characters in Central/Estern European they would seek help and reference from people with more knowledge in those areas. The same is true of those I have known who have completed Greek or Cyrillic versions of their fonts. <br> <br>However, the questions here are not of linguistics, but of established style and practice. <br> <br>As to Michael's original question, yes of course you should look at any typeface that you are developing in a composed form. It's so easy to do today that I'm amazed that one would even consider not doing so. <br> <br>The point of a typeface in the end is not to define individually perfect looking letters - because you must end up compromising on that anyway - but to develop a set of characters that work well together in text (or display). <br> <br>Building a typeface character by character is as flawed as stealing parts out of the GM plant and trying to build a Cadillac bit by bit over time (ie the trunk of a '57 with the fender of a '63...) </div>

This does *not* mean there's no difference - please don't lump my conclusions together like you did above. Maybe you see no difference between the conscious and sub-conscious natures of type? <br> <br>> Considering the colision of likely letter pairs isn't really an issue <br> <br>You're ignoring something fundamental: we don't read letterpairs, we read *words*. And *that's* the linguistics I'm talking about. Pairs are just one part of it, emphasized because it was the only part we could feasibly fool with... until now with OpenType! <br> <br>The reason not enough type designers bother with linguistics is because it's not cost-effective considering the lack of sensitivity of readers, hence the people who buy type. But money isn't everything, is it?... <br> <br>> they would seek help and reference from people with more knowledge in those areas. <br> <br>How much help? It's certainly uesful to have linguistic data available - it makes you more self-sufficient. Another major way it helps you is in making better non-Latin type (assuming you care about that...). <br> <br>> I think it's a potent reminder that "linguistics" plays a part in typography to the extent that language is a determiner of culture <br> <br>Of course, but that in no way makes linguistic awareness unimportant. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> I think maybe you're being too literal. <br> <br>What I meant by "readers can't tell the difference between Times and Garamond" is simply that for the average reader, there's not enough *conscious* difference for them to care (and caring *is* what counts, yes). This conclusion is based on having spent a lot of time as the lone font-geek among non-font-geeks. <br> <br>What I meant by "they can *feel* the difference" is that their subconscious is affected by the type, even if they don't realize it. This however might not be based on much more than wishful thinking on my part as a [part-time] type designer... <br> <br>Now, if this distinction seems contrived to you, let me ask you this "key" question: what's the difference between a display face and a text face? <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Jonathan asks rather leadingly whether I would, dare to say it, disagree with Matthew Carter - and Jonathan's Swedish customer? <br> <br>I think this isn't quite a linguistic question, but a stylistic one. There will of course be a whole slew of Swedish type users who neither know nor care about this preference to differentiate accent use in Swedish. And I doubt that anyone setting German in Sweden will actually take the trouble to set their Swedish text in the prefered style and the German in a different style - ie it cannot be linguistic if they would do the same with other languages. <br> <br>Also, you'll have experience of different punctuation prefences for region or languages, or just ignorance (French setting leaving spaces before some terminal punctuation, some putting double spaces after a period... some using three periods instead of an ellipsis :-)) - which are stylistic rather than linguistic. <br> <br>Or, for instance, some using "oe" or "ae" ligatures rather than two separate characters, or umlauat over the "i" in "naive". <br> <br>(Or Swiss-German not using [germandbls].) <br> <br>So, no I don't say that Mr Carter is wrong, but that it's a stylistic rather than linguistic issue. <br> <br>Either way it is something readily accomodated with modern type systems. </div>

<div class=commentbody> to be completely honest, there have been so many posts today that i've completely lost track of the discussion. <br> <br>i believe i was simply trying to bring 'appropriateness of type choice time/place/usage' into the discussion. <br> <br>[[that said. yes TNR did (metal version previous to digital) have very fine serifs, but when they would make the molds (can't remember the proper term, help on this please) the serifs would be exaggerated (also the reason i believe for the thicks/thins). from the reading i have done most newsfaces at that time weren't so daring in their design (griffiths readability series, not that these didn't contribute). this is off topic sorry. Andy, obviously i'm simply agreeing with you. did the times take advantage of the newer offset technologies? have not read up on this recently. suppose my memory is fuzzy.]] <br> <br>also forgive the lack of uc characters. it is late.

<div class=commentbody> maybe another way to put that would be: <br> <br>TNR was one of the first attempts to get beyond the more monoline text faces for newpaper.

The question is: for how encompassing an audience does one wish to design? From a marketing standpoint, is it desirable/feasible for, say, a Canadian designer to invest the time and energy to complete a font with a full complement of Greek, Cyrillic, Swedish, Vietnamese and Lapp (et al) characters, styles, alignment, accents and diacritics? <br> <br>Well, yes and no. Yes if the designer wishes to market or use the design beyond his/her back yard; no, I suppose, if this is less of a concern. <br> <br>As a new designer just preparing to dip his toe into the waters of font marketing, this is a real concern to me. I want my fonts to be as professional and universal is is feasible. Some days it seems that the more I work on a font, the farther back the finish line seems to move. <br> <br>(Architrave has a "hook-u" and a "barred-H" among others in its alternates set now, however. ;) ) <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody> Back to the original question: <br> <br>The most depressing moment in my type design experience was when I set my first "complete" face into a body of text. It was just gross. I found that my work had only started. To judge a face it needs to be seen in its context. (The breadth of that context has been debated at length here, but it really does depend on the indended audience.) <br> <br>As for "linguistic" statistics, I don't use higher math to chart the frequencies of letter pairs, but looking at some big chunks of text always helps. </div>

It isn't at all uncommon for an Australasian or European ISP to have ARIN diesignated IPs, you can guess other combinations). <br> <br>Some ISPs are clearly pan-national or even pan-continental, centralizing on a few network gateways. <br> <br>It is also not uncommon for ISPs to use private network IPs, then send all traffic thru a few common gateways (I think AOL and @Home did this). <br> <br>**** <br> <br>Are you suggesting that scripts other than Roman don't matter, and that Hindi or Cantonese/Mandarin are not written (or perhaps that their speaker's are illiterate)? <br> <br>dumb: a.Lacking the power of speech.

<div class=commentbody> It does seem to me that the Anonymouses of the world (well, of this forum anyway) do like to take Hrant's (et al) comments well out of context, apparently for the sole purpose of contrariety. It was pretty clear to me what Hrant meant in terms of setting the word "the" in Syntax, and that the discussion of other scripts is irrelevent in this context. <br> <br>The attack and implication that Hrant (of all people!) considers non-Roman/non-Latin scripts to be irrelevent is absurd to any who pay attention to these forums, and certainly lends credence to the theory that these various Anonymouses are only here to be contrary and cause trouble. <br> <br>It also strikes me that Anonymous <br>> Joe, you shouldn't really confuse "computer" with "gateway" - two very distinct things, which means you don't know what you think you know. <br> <br>and even Anon#3 <br>> Mr Hrant, even a novice sniffer knows that, though maybe Joe isn't a sniffer at all and would "guess" wrong, you can't really get very far tracing an IP address to a geographical location (Tomahawks with satellite nav are going to miss). <br> <br>certainly seem to be flaunting their belief that they can say and do almost anything on these forums, no matter how inane or inflammatory, with no risk of consequence. <br> <br>I can't help but notice how posting in general on other threads has slowed markedly since these offensive Anonymous posts began. Speaking for myself, I'm getting tired of having to wade through them as well, only to find that they are the only offerings of the forums of late. I have much better ways to spend my time if I can't find civil, reasoned discussion of typography here. I suspect that I am not alone in this feeling. <br> <br>>dumb: a.Lacking the power of speech.

<div class=commentbody> > I can't help but notice how posting in general on other threads has slowed markedly since these offensive Anonymous posts began. <br> <br>Indeed. And this is the typical pattern. On one other list the offender got increasingly rabid, eventually getting expelled, but was allowed to rejoin upon promising to refrain from personal attacks. Unfortunately, he picked up right where he had left off, and it took many more months of increasingly vicious attacks (including accusations of rape) for him to be expelled again. The worst part is that the entire process took over a year, during which many people ran away and the list was basically useless, and even now it's still pretty sickly. And in that case nobody was even anoymous... <br> <br>So, why does this happen? Clearly some people get so infuriated by certain people that trying to destroy them becomes a very important part of their lives, and for them sabotaging a public area which the reviled person frequents becomes a viable course of action. This is fundamentalist thinking - "just blow it up". And anonymity helps the cause a great deal. <br> <br>I think this forum is very valuable, and has quickly come to play an important role; the Critique area for one is a unique gem in the font world. As much as I hate censorship (and believe me I can handle any ASCII attack, with a smile), I feel there are "singularities" which have to be dealt with as exceptions, to preserve overall health. And I've come to question the value of anonymity: in *practice*, how many of the anonymous posts here have been more than just part of a smear campaign? I think maybe 2. <br> <br>Idea #1: Show the IP address for anonymous posts (MyFonts does this - but only part of the address). <br> <br>Idea #2: Anonymous posts would be allowed, but screened for offensive/deceptive content. Yes, it's subjective, and yes, it's more work for the Typophile crew, but it might be a much needed compromise. In any case, to me things are pretty clear now (again...), and the clearer things are, the sooner you act the better. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Why allow anonymous posts in the first place? It seems to me that people post anonymously not to protect the anonymity of their identity so much as to avoid accountability of their message. <br> <br>If all posts require a valid email address, a user's true identity can still be protected, but it gives the forum administrators the option to block that account should the need arise. <br> <br>Just my 44 lira... </div>

<div class=commentbody> I tend to agree with the previous post. I'm not at all sure that anonymous posting is necessary on a forum such as this. After all, this isn't the witness protection program; nobody is putting him- or herself in danger by posting an opinion or critique on type (and if for some reason they are, then perhaps they shouldn't be posting to a public forum in the first place). <br> <br>We've certainly seen the abuses in the past few days, from personal attacks to identity fraud to threats against the board itself. <br> <br>A "nom de pixel" or screen name should be protection enough for anyone who resists posting under his/her own name. <br> <br>44 more lira from me.

<div class=commentbody> > nobody is putting him- or herself in danger by posting an opinion or critique on type <br> <br>Well, probably not [much] physical danger. But "to err is human", and sometimes it's hard for otherwise rational people to separate the "pure" idea from the source, resulting in inferior discussion. Just like happened here, actually: if I had made my own posts anonymously, you can bet that the Sandpeople would have been much quieter! (Well, that's not a "positive" example, but you know what I mean.) <br> <br>But anyway, the pseudonym option is always (well, still...) available. <br> <br>> nom de pixel <br> <br>:-) <br>Or "nom d'ASCII". <br> <br>hhp </div>
