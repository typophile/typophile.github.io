    happening. <em>(As nice as the flash thingie was / may have been, it wasn't quite
    useful. No direct linking, for example.)</em>\r\n\r\nOh, and by the way, most
    of your typefaces are just breathtakingly beautiful.\r\n\r\nDav(id)"

    how quickly you pump out these amazing families so quickly as well as finding
    the time to do countless redesigns of your site. I could certainly use some masterful
    lessons in Dino's world of time management.\r\n\r\nFantastic as always!"

    than work.\r\nFor me, time management, is working all the time I can.\r\n\r\nThe
    new typefaces (Glosa and Prelo) took me 8 months of hard work,\r\nwhile the website
    took 4 days to release.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Dino, your work called my attention years ago. Since then, I usually go to
    your website to see what's new. \r\nThe website works well, I just miss more samples
    of your fonts at small sizes. It will be good to see how they look on two or more
    paragraphs.\r\nBy the way, now I'm using Andrade and Leitura in the design of
    a brazilian publication (I'm still working on it). "

    few are expecting release as Opentype families, but what about the rest?

    Even if Prelo isn't on their site yet, there's a possibility they would sell it
