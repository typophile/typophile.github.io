  body: I just received my copy, it looks interesting, but I haven&#39;t had time
    to read it. I&#39;ll post as soon as I&#39;ve read it, but I keep re-reading Elements
    of Typographic Style, which is so inspiring and incredibly insightful.

  body: I have not read it through, yet, but it is an attractive little book. It is
    a revised and much expanded version of his essay in <i>Language Culture Type</i>.

    of September, but they miscalculated or something: it&#39;s on back-order, so
    I probably won&#39;t see it for at least another month. :-&#40;'

  body: I just finished it after picking it up at Bringhurst&#39;s Center for Book
    Arts lecture. Very nicely done, both in terms of the writing and the solid form
    of the book.

    one holds a thing well made. Ahh, print.

  body: '&#34;Language Culture Type&#34; is an excellent book which I also have recently
    purchased.  I highly recomend it. It is rare to see such high-level discussion
    of typography on multicultural levels between the covers of one book. <BR> <BR>ChrisL'
