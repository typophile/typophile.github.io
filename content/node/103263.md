  recent research]] by Lawrence Zitnick\x03 on a handwriting averaging approach based
  on sampling is not only interesting, but holds enough potential to influence the
  way we do type design. Basically, the algorithm takes user stroke samples in real
  time (with the help of a pen tablet) to increase stroke consistency in a non-destructive
  manner. Take a look at the presentation video (link at the bottom); there's no need
  to put it into words.\r\n\r\nI wonder: If this algorithm could take stroke-width
  information into account, the application to the digitization process of calligraphic
  \u2018handwritten\u2019 fonts is obvious. \r\n\r\nPutting sampling aside, the paper
  suggests more: an algorithm could take an existant font, analyze frequent characteristics
  among all different glyphs (within the same font) and average independently over
  each this characteristics. This makes sense specially because the algorithm doesn't
  destroy variation, as it always averages: tendencies are reinforced. Like the idea
  behind the [[http://iotic.com/averia/|average font]], but built upon a much more
  clever procedure.\r\n\r\nEven more helpful would be the partitioning of glyphs*
  into primary components (stems, bowls, serifs, terminals, etc.) to allow global
  tweaking of weight, contrast and proportions without making use of interpolation.
  Of course, this is a na\xEFve statement, but it isn't necessarily unfeasible.\r\n\r\nLink

    that such a system with tweak ability was made, (font chameleon), and that it's

    \ Was it a sufficient improvement to merit the public whipping of the OP?"

    isolates and reads hyper-links out loud. If all it says is \u201Carticle\u201D
    or \u201Chere\u201D it provides them with no contextual information. Especially
    if \u201Cclick here\u201D is on the same page several times, and they all go to
    different places. It\u2019s pretty standard accessibility practice.\r\n\r\nSee
    <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/\">the Web Content Accessibility
    Guidelines 1.0</a> (1999):\r\nFrom section 13.1: Clearly identify the target of
    each link. [Priority 2]\r\n<em>Link text should be meaningful enough to make sense
    when read out of context -- either on its own or as part of a sequence of links.
    Link text should also be terse.\r\nFor example, in HTML, write \"Information about
    version 4.3\" instead of \"click here\". In addition to clear link text, content
    developers may further clarify the target of a link with an informative link title
    (e.g., in HTML, the \"title\" attribute)</em>.\r\n\r\nSee also <a href=\"http://www.nngroup.com/articles/top-ten-web-design-mistakes-of-2005/\">
    the Nielsen Norman Group\u2019s post on the Top 10 Web Design Mistakes of 2005</a>:\r\nFrom

    list goes on. A surprisingly common (and easy to correct) mistake thats\u2019s
    still haunting us after more than two decades. All it takes is a few more seconds
    of forethought when writing for the web."

    actually. Like, typing or copying a written letter several times and have the
    algorithm add variety to each letter\u2014or does this exist already?\r\n\r\nChris,
    you're right, though I wonder how high the chances are of a visually impaired
    person on Typophile making use of text-to-speech converters. Still, it's good
    practice and it's something I learned at my multi-media course to improve usability.
    If someone points out how to do it better, why not do it? Last year I was in a
    lecture class and I noticed a guy in front of me was designing a flyer on his
    laptop and he was using hyphens where he should have been using dashes. I pointed
    the error of his ways out to him but it took him longer than 3 seconds to find
    out how to type a dash so he said \"Never mind\". It frustrated me tremendously.
    Mind you, this is a designer, who should care about these things.\r\n\r\nChris,
    I noticed the quote on your profile and you might find this an interesting read:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem\r\nI guess it's a big distinction
    between the ability to measure and the ability to measure accurately, but it seems
    on the quantum level it's inherently impossible to measure things as they are."
