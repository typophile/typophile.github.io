body: "Does anyone know the skinny on this URW++ cut of Futura?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/\r\n\r\nLike
  who designed it and, when?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems closer to the original Renner drawing
  of futura.\r\nThe weights are more nuanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny help is very appreciated!"

  body: The "T" means it is for text sizes and was probably based on a text size cut
    of the original.
