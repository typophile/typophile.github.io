  body: Could this be <a href="http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_wilson/wilson.html">Foundry
    Wilson</a> yet again? It certainly would help if [[The Foundry]] decided to show
    complete character sets of their fonts or incorporate a test driver in their website.

  body: "It is indeed Foundry Wilson. Good eye Yves. You can see a full sample of
    the font from the Serif Font ID Guide <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_fg/foundry_wilson_full.gif\">here</a>.
