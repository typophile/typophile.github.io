body: i&#39;m curious to know what typophile readers find to be the most elegant and
  stylish typefaces, and why. also, what makes a typeface elegant? and, is elegance
  intrinsic or conferred upon? maybe it is a lot to answer. mostly i&#39;m interested
  in readers at least listing what typefaces they find to be the most elegant.

  body: Interesting question. I wouldn&#39;t combine elegant and stylish though, because
    to me the former has austerity while the second has flair. <BR> <BR>What makes
    for elegance? Narrowness seems to be the strongest factor, but also conservatism,
    rigidity and smoothness. Like Times is a very elegant face, actually &#40;which
    is why it&#39;s really a display face and not a text face - at least in digital&#41;.

  body: Stylish, almost anything by Emigre, Mason alternates are used on the new Troy
    movie poster. Elegant Sloop by Font Bureau comes to mind.

    in the definition of classy. but i hate using that word since donald trump ruined
    it.
