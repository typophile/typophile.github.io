  body: "Hey guys.\r\n\r\nIt looks like a Gotham Black variation, here's a comparison,
    the <strong>'</strong> symbol looks different. Unless they used another glyph.
    Please take a look at this comparison:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/RblwCSZ.gif\"/>\r\n\r\nPlease
    advice."

    |\u2019|.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s still Gotham."

  body: As K.C. said. Other minor variations are almost certainly due to embedding
    and extracting into and out of a video.
