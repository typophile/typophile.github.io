  chart is interesting, since I didn't agree with most of the average \"best representation\"
  dots of each color. It was done in '72, maybe that's why.\r\n\r\nMy norms, based
  on my monitor: Red - up one from shown dot. Orange - down a square. Blue & Yellow
  - one to the right."

  body: Cool. I remember reading that the Japanese sense of blue & green as seperate
    was introduced from the west. Of course shades were discerned but conceptualy
    most shades of blue & green were grouped.
