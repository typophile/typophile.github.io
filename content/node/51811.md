  to use Novarese (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/itc-novarese/). Problem is that
  the italic caps are not actually italic, which presents some problems. Does anybody
  know the reasoning behind this fact? Any good suggestions for alternatives that
  have similar qualities as Novarese?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nFred. "

    Text]] reveals a lot of Novarese influence and can make a nice, crisp alternative.\r\n\r\nThe
    upright caps in Novarese Italic are a nod to the earliest italic styles in type,
    such as those by Arrighi, ca. early 1500s, which utilized roman capitals. \r\n\r\n--
