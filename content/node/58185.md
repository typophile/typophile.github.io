body: Just wondering if anybody out there knows how the MyFonts popularity scores
  are calculated.  At first it seemed to be 5000 points per sale, then this changed
  to 5001, then later sales are 501.  Do fonts get less points per sale the longer
  they've been available?

  body: "You've touched on one aspect of how we calculate it. We certainly bias it
    towards recent sales.\r\n\r\nHowever we don't document it publicly, and I'm not
    going to here, principally because we reserve the right to tweak the formula as
    to how font popularity is exposed and utilized. It's a tricky thing to compare
    the popularity of an expensive 20-weight text family that sells a handful of copies,
    with an inexpensive display font that sells in the hundreds per week. Yet even
    within a genre and a price bracket, there's no single answer to the question of
    the best formula to use.\r\n\r\nI'd be interested to hear how other distributors
    do it, and even how foundries determine their own \"bestsellers\". How much cash
    did this family generate this week (or other period)? How many weights have been
    sold? How many sales did this family play a part in? Are last month's sales part
    of this font's current popularity? If so, what about the month before last? If
    so, to what extent? Are the families as organized by the foundry or by the distributor
    the best aggregation units for popularity scores? Perhaps we should build a grid
    with hundreds of controls so everyone who sells a font can appear high up on some
    list..."

    MyFonts doesn't release that information for the same reason Google isn't telling
    us how to get our websites to show up #1 in the results. I'm not sure why this
    surprises anyone.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "While I certainly agree that under some circumstances popularity ranking
    systems should not be publicized in great detail as that would lead some to try
    and game the system to their own advantage (as I'm sure a few will try to do anyway),
    it's not unfair to expect a very generalized explanation of the guiding principles
    of such a formula. We aren't talking about democracy or the Academy Awards here,
    after all.\r\n\r\nSummarizing what L.P. said, MyFonts' formula is biased toward
    recent sales, and there may be other factors. Not very detailed, but at least
    it's no longer mysterious. That maybe isn't all that a lot of people would want
    to know about it, but it is sufficient to assure that they aren't pulling numbers
    out of their butts while still not providing enough information that someone could
    artificially skew the results, at least not without significant personal expense."
