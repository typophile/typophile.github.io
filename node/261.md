  body: Yves -- <BR> <BR>I think you&#39;re jumping the gun again. As Eduardo stated,
    it &#42;looks like&#42; Knockout, but it&#39;s not. <BR> <BR>Notice that middle
    arm of Knockout&#39;s E does not extend all the way as in the sample. The leg
    of the R in Knockout has more &#39;swagger&#39; than the sample. Knockout&#39;s
    1 does not feature a top extension, but instead is only a vertical with a bite
    out of it -- very distinctive. The exclamation in Knockout descends with straight
    sides and then abruptly converges, unlike the consistent taper of this sample.
    <BR> <BR>In fact, this is Font Bureau&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/rhode/boldnormal/testdrive.html?s=JOCKTNUMER16%21&amp;p=36"

    developped a really nasty habit of posting  <BR>something quick quick just before
    leaving for somewhere. <BR>You&#39;re right, I bow my head with shame. :/ It appears
    I &#42;do&#42; <BR>tend to make a fool of myself these days, don&#39;t I?
