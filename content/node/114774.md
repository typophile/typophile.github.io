  a black keyline. I want it to replicate the \"Meanwhile back at the Bat Cave\" type
  from a golden age comic book.\r\nEvery other designer I know derides Comic Sans,
  but what other font would you choose for this purpose?\r\nThanks"

    | here]]. There are experts there who know of many faces, one of which may fit
    what you need.
