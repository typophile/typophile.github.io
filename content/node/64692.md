body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nThis is my first post here & I know I will get some good
  honest feedbacks.\r\nThis a logo for a technical exhibit that happens in my company
  once every year. Basically the logo is for the theme this year -- iNewvation.\r\n\r\nThe
  idea is to show that new ideas coupled with active efforts lead to innovation.\r\nThe
  logo is not something very hot .. basically trying to show \"out of the box thinking\"
  & through some movement in the logo the act of breaking out of the box! \r\n\r\nI
  have some serious doubts about the kerning and the general feel of the logo though
  as I cant say I am very adept at that and it is my first attempt at something like
  this. Would love to hear your comments on this and improve it as much as I can ...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TechfairLogo_6134.v1.jpg]"
