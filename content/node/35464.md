    this an old publication? It looks 60ish -- 70ish."

  body: This is an old Phil Martin font from around 1970 called Avalon. Red Rooster
    (a.k.a. House of Fonts) carries the URW version which is called <a href="http://roostertypes.com/view_fullfont.asp?catalogid=316802&suit=AvernusURW&individual=yes&total=3">Avernus</a>.
    This is as close to an official release of this as you're going to get. Unfortunately,
    the alternate characters, many of which are used in your sample, were not digitized.
