body: "I'm a little stuck. My client has chosen \"Engravers Lt\" for a logotype for
  a restaurant that we're working on. Not a choice I would've made, but since it was
  one of the suggestions I gave, I'd be happy to roll with it and work with it. \r\n\r\nThe
  look we're going for is classy (where have you heard that one before), contemporary,
  but not too formal, stuffy or otherwise fuddy duddy. \r\n\r\nNow I need to find
  a matching \"text\" face  to go with it. He has a preference for serif faces, but
  I'm open to both. I have suggested Neutraface to contrast with Engravers and to
  give the identity a modern edge. \r\n\r\nI am looking for something that is \r\n-slightly
  broad (like engravers), \r\n- something with both old style and lining figures and
  also \r\n- small caps. IS that too much to ask?\r\n\r\nI have tried Goudy Old Style,
  Mrs Eaves, Adobe Caslon. But it seems like none of them are working very well. Mrs
  Eaves small caps is ok but the rest of it looks too \"pretty\" for this quite androgynous
  or even \"masculine\" look we have going. \r\n\r\nOn the bright side, we're not
  really setting prose, so it does not need to be *too* readable. Just namecards and
  menus.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions at all would be welcome. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    \"contemporary\", but that term is a far cry from Engravers, so I went with the
    best fit for the type you are working with. Scotch romans, text didones, sharp
    serifs, and a few contemporary faces that share characteristics of those."

  body: "Hi Steph, \r\nThanks for your suggestions! \r\n\r\n> Some of these are not
    what I would call \u201Ccontemporary\u201D, but that term is a far cry from Engravers,\r\n\r\nExactly
    what I told the client. \"Contemporary\" is not equals to what he chose. But I
    supposed ever since the genre got mixed up with luxury goods, it became somewhat
    associated with being modern, classy and \"contemporary\". \r\n\r\nSo now, I'm
    taking a step back and trying to see through his eyes. How something like \"Engravers\"
    is contemporary, and how to use it as if it was \"modern\" and \"contemporary\".\r\n\r\nActually,
    I made a mistake, he chose AT Sackers. \r\n\r\nI first looked  at Luxury, and
    I really liked Diamond, etc, so I chose a poor man's version \u2014 engravers
    and gave Sackers as an option.\r\n\r\nThe client liked the funky \"C\" in Sackers.
    I have MAJOR MAJOR problems with the Sackers \"R\". And also the contrast. It's
    not nearly as high contrast as engravers, which I kinda prefer. But the serifs
    in Engravers, I find too pronounced. \r\n\r\nSo now I know what exactly we're
    paying for when you dish out $$$ for Luxury. \r\n\r\nBut first, I'll check out
    all your suggestions!!! \r\n\r\n "

    If there were, it would be nice to get it redrawn. I'll have to think of a low-cost
    way to fix it.\r\n\r\n"
