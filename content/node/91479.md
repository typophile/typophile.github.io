    please tell me why. I won't argue.

  body: "The first one might have some Art Nouveau potential,\r\nbut it's quite a
    distance from being of any real value.\r\n\r\nThe second one isn't highly original,
    but it does have\r\na marketable character. Is it based on anything?\r\n\r\nThe
    third one looks like you took a generic sans and\r\ntried to make it more like
    Yellow. I think Yellow is\r\na great source of inspiration, but it would be much\r\nbetter
    to start from scratch.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "hrant, the second isnt really based on anything except perhaps the strange
    thread of design that started out as German Sans and ended up becoming American
    Urban.\r\n\r\nThe original is available here, free for anyone and all purposes
    except for being sold as a font:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/mob.font\r\n\r\nThe
    version in the pic above is a slight refinement of the font.  As well as better
    letter spacing and few small tweaks, I suppose the biggest factor in decided to
    refine it was the lower case g.  I go back and fourth over whether I like the
    top right hand \"corner\" of that glyph more square, as it is in version 1.0,
    or more rounded as I am working on in version 2.0.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2gs_6406.png]"

    where there would be full-fledged\r\nelements might possibly be fruitful.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: That was the idea, hrant.  but I think the rest of the glyphs are so rounded
    and smooth, the bulged g sticks out too much.  Seeing them side by side though,
    I think I may have made the upper counter of the 2nd version g a bit too large.

    have it around.... I can't find it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Argon is somewhat related:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/82830\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ohbendy/sets/72157625196184681/"
