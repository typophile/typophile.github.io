  Palatino as a display face and Eurostile as a text face. It bugs me, to me they
  don\xB4t fit in. Is just me (I am not so experienced in this..). What is your opinion?"

    work the other way around, but I think that one would have to be mad to specify
    Eurostile for text and Palatino for display. "

  body: Oh my, you are right, the brand guidelines actually say it the other way around.
    For some reason in their brochures and advertisements it is used like I wrote.
    (now I must say LOL :-D )

  body: '@david - No nothing is going to change as it is in the Brand Guidelines,
    I as a novice typographer just wanted to hear what you who are more experienced
    thought about it, as I was wondering how it looked strange to me. - And I wanted
    to learn something at the same time. Thank you very much to everyone who has commented.'

  body: "<em>Palatino isn\u2019t a proper text face</em>\r\n\r\nIt's OK for many text
    tasks. I was in the same situation as you Miro, twenty years ago, working with
    Palatino as a corporate face, and supplemented it with Aldus for body text in
    more \"bookish\" settings."

  body: "Hrant is correct... Aldus was designed as the text face and Palatino as the
    \"advertising\" face. I do however have Feder und Stichel  from the beginning
    of the 50's where he employed Palatino as a text face and it is beautiful. Cut
    by August Rosenberger.\r\n\r\nMichael"
