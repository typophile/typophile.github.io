body: "So I've just downloaded about a hundred or so fonts in the past couple of days
  and my typeface selection is now looking a bit cluttered...\r\n\r\nI have noticed
  that when downloading non-commercial fonts, they are often not as well organised
  as I'd like and the various typeface variants appear as seperate entries when selecting
  one in illustrator for example, (e.g. \"Font\", \"Font-Bold\", \"Font-Condensed\",
  \"Font-Expanded\"); rather than as a single entry (e.g. \"Font\") with sub categories
  in the second menu (e.g. \"Bold\", \"Condensed\" etc.).\r\n\r\nI was simply wondering
  if there was a way to compile these variants into a sub-categorised form as mentioned?\r\n\r\nHope
  that makes sense... Thanks :)"

    Anal-Retentive, innit? You can always open the fonts in a font editor, rename
    them the way you want them, then generate new versions...if the EULAs allow it."

  body: Well, at least the commercial fonts you downloaded have their naming set up
    correctly (DIN Pro in the second image). Perhaps that's the reason why they usually
    cost money?

  body: "Jens has a point: those cheap (or even free) fonts don\u2019t always adhere
    to the naming conventions. It IS part of the quality control that a proper designer
    should have\u2026 and the reason why a nominal renumeration is required.\r\n"

    the EULA\u2019s of the fonts you need to edit, as many of them (even free ones)
    might not allow modifications."
