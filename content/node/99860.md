  body: Why not use clipart - google (images) for god clipart. Yes, you'll have to
    spell it out. Google ignores blanks and dashes and other punctuation.

  body: "As you may know, Christians have used the Chi-Rho symbol as a monogram for
    Jesus Christ since the 4th Century C.E.\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ChiRho_5524.jpg]\r\nIt's
    literally a monogram, formed of the Greek letters <em>chi</em> and <em>rho</em>,
    the first two letters of the name <em>Christ</em>. This makes it too specific,
    I think, for your purpose, but may give you a widely-recognized historical precedent
    to help guide your efforts."
