		<div class="commentbody">There are some things I really like (such as the shy top of the &quot;a&quot;), but I have two big complaints: <BR>- The strong head serifs are pulling the design counter-clockwise (which is not easy to counteract). <BR>- The widths are inconsistent, like look at the &quot;b&quot; versus the &quot;h&quot;. <BR> <BR>Some specific suggestions: <BR>- The &quot;f&quot; is too soft and big on top. <BR>- The &quot;g&quot; is too mannered: tame the ear, and make the head smaller. <BR>- The &quot;k&quot; is wonderful, although in the &quot;too narrow&quot; group. <BR>- Put a notch in the ear of the &quot;q&quot;. <BR>- Tame the beak of the &quot;r&quot;. <BR>- Make the &quot;t&quot; stronger. <BR>- I actually like the &quot;v&quot; et al. <BR>- Open up the &quot;x&quot;. <BR>- The &quot;z&quot; is too blocky. <BR> <BR>BTW, your vertical proportions are right on for use at small sizes (like 9 pt), and the darkish color matches that too.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Dominik, <BR> <BR>This looks nice! <BR>I don't think you went too far with the head serifs :-) <BR> <BR>f: I think it wants the same kind of terminal as your y and r. (Though I'd choose beaks not ball terminals.) Also, it curves too abruptly. Look at the c for more of the flavor. <BR> <BR>hmn: the h and n are too narrow. The m looks like 2 n's. keep the m, and widen the h and n. <BR> <BR>r: The arm joins to high (same place as the n). Lower that down for better color. I'd also make it narrower. (and do a beak like the f) <BR> <BR>s: I'd take a touch of weight out of the curves and put it into the spine. <BR> <BR>vw: take in the serifs a bit. These letters cause spacing problems as it is. More serifs mean too much white space around the letter. <BR> <BR>x: looks like he's just kicked a soccer ball. ie, the bottom right should extend below the baseline (too high now). Also, you are in the presence of an optical illusion: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21279.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>Sliding the thins left and right does two things: <BR>1. Fixes the optical illusion and makes them look like they're connected. <BR>2. Helps the shape fit into a trapazoid: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21280.gif" alt=""> <BR>You want the trapezoid shape so the letters don't feel like they are leaning, and are nicely balanced on the ground. Check your x,s,g,z <BR> <BR>y: A little wider up top (left) <BR> <BR>p: decide what you want. I'd put a serif on the left side of the decender too. Keep the form for the q. <BR> <BR>Keep it up! <BR>Randy <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm back again. <BR> <BR>I had a long fight with the uppercase. I couldn't really decide about the proportion of these. I didn't like them to have same width all over (as far as this is possible). So I took a base rectangle and tried to construct them.  <BR> <BR>Further I changed the lc &quot;s&quot; again and made it a bit narrower. I didn't like the look of two wide &quot;ss&quot; standing next to each other. (An &quot;ss&quot; ligature comes to my mind right now, because if the &quot;s&quot; stands alone at the beginning it looks a bit small now) <BR> <BR>Next thing I'll get done is the spacing. I played arround a bit and had some good results. (I used the summary in &quot;Type &amp; Typography&quot;). <BR>But after changing some character widths I quickly used FOG's autop spacing and lost it all again. <BR>The optical spacing feature in InDesign wasn't better though, the type seemed like &quot;gesperrt&quot; (I don't know the english term right now). I had to correct it by at least &quot;-50&quot; to get a good result. <BR>So I hope I can provide a text setting soon. <BR> <BR>These were my problems so far.
