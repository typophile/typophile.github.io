    to say which typeface that would fit him best? This must vary a lot from person
    to person depending on memories etc. Who knows, you might find some of mine good
    enough?\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com"

    can see the only consistent thing with Bond is the 007/gun logo and semi-clad
    women. I had to recreate the look for a job and used imagery rather than relying
    on type in the end, the more recent use a flare serif. I think I used Friz Quadrata.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/friz-quadrata-sh/\r\nTim"

    has some that could work. Glyphic Neue and a few of the Trapper variants could
    definitely work.
