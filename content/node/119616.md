    a smoke trail, though I don't like it much yet, it feels somewhat out of place,

    way to represent smoke?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/film_12_small_5096.png]"

    mind your drawing; that\u2019s absolutely legitimate. In any case, you can alter
    some detail.\r\n\r\nFor instance, i cannot regognize if the guy is wearing a coat
    or short trousers. The hat would imply a coat. So, i would close the bottom part
    above the knees and straighten the left side of the coat."

  body: "@ J\xFCrgen: I can't seem to get the smoke right, it feels too cartoonish.
    I've left it away for now. (Unless you have a suggestion on how to make it fit
    into the abstract style of the rest of the graphic?)\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't have occurred
    to me that the guy could be wearing flappy shorts. The hat and the fact that his
    legs wear skinny trousers are pretty unambiguous IMHO. I've tried manipulating
    the bottom of the coat, but whatever I did looked worse than before. Making the
    edges of the coat more symmetric actually favored the \"shorts\" impression, and
    removing the gap between them made him look like an exhibitionist rather than
    a mobster...\r\n\r\nBy the way, I had to change the title on the poster because
    the boss of the project (who is the orchestra director) apparently insisted on
    his exceptionally stupid-sounding, kindergarden-worthy, misleadingly-spelled,
    content-challenged Swiss German title. That also required me to rearrange the
    title graphically, during which I changed the font to make it fit the width of
    the doorway.\r\n\r\nFinally, I caved and added a solid black drop shadow to the
    text on the red bar after all. Can I get away with it if I blame it on the retro
    style of the poster?  ;o)  It just gives the title some clout; without it, it
    feels fuzzy and incorporeal to me.\r\n\r\n@ Gabrielle: Good catch on the reds!
    \ I changed them to be the same.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/film_19_small_3706.png]"

  body: The new title seems entirely out of place. What does singing have to do with
    film music? I do like how the typography is aligned with the doorway though. I
    don't think I would use any drop shadow at all.

  body: "@ Martin: The program is mostly film music with choir, sometimes even just
    choir a cappella. Even so, it's ridiculously off-register and nonsensical, since
    it sounds like a call to the poster reader to sing one specific song. Can't change
    it, though.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I'm supposed to add three sponsor/affiliation logos.
    That's a bit tricky. They take up a lot of space and attention unless I make them
    so small as to blend with the text, at which point they might become very hard
    to read on the flyer (which is apparently going to be A6 format?).  I could stow
    them on the top of the page with the choir and orchestra logos, but it doesn't
    fit well with the diagonal movement up there, and makes the whole arrangement
    look messy.\r\n\r\nArgh... what do you think?  I'm currently leaning towards the
    second.\r\n\r\n(As for the drop shadow: I know it's out of fashion, but I like
    it here. I'll pretend it's for retro purposes!)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/film_22_3767.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/film_23_4132.png]"
