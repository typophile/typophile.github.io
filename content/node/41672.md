  body: "From the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq\">FAQ</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>And
    logos of sports teams?</strong>\r\nThere you have to keep in mind that sports
    merchandising -- everything from baseball caps to soccer jerseys -- is big business,
    so the popular sports teams have every reason to make their logo as difficult
    to imitate as possible. Most of them are custom designed or use heavily customized
    existing fonts."
