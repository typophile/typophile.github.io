  body: "I can imagine that a future generation of digital paper would have, rather
    than visual pixels, miniature pistons which could be programmed to create braille,
    or even combine with visual pixels to create a pseudo-letterpress effect.\r\n\r\nThere's
    an interesting gallery in the Tate Modern that has high-contrast graphic images
    displayed next to blind-embossed versions. It's shocking to realize just how tactilely
    illiterate one is. "

    a nice idea. There are several dozen different braille standards in the world,
    using different sized dots at different intervals (all fixed sizes), so such digital
    paper would likely be limited to supporting a particular standard."
