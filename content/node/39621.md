body: "Hi all, \r\n\r\nFirst post, but been a reader for a long time.\r\n\r\nI'm updating
  a client's logo and ran into a snag.  The logotype basically hasn't changed since
  1975, we just updated the bug. However, the owner of this company just through a
  curve-ball and asked the we replace the \" curved y\" with a \"normal slanted y\".\r\n\r\nOf
  course this drove me nuts, I thought their original styling was good, why mess with
  it? Especially at this point - we've already jumped into laying out new web and
  print materials.  Anyway, I re-created the y, but it just doesn't look right to
  me. Also, is the kerning OK? I was considering doing this and a \"small\" version
  with more character spacing. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KellyPipe_1_5255.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
  a graphic designer - just picking up what little I know about type here and in magazines
  / tutorials. I have thick skin though, so fire away. Any and all suggestions for
  the \"y\" as well as the rest of the type and logo would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your input!\r\n\r\nDaniel Peterson\r\n[[http://artesiandesigngroup.com|Artesian

    slightly updated look. What if you slant the left side of the p as well. Both
    with the new y and the old y. that might tie the whole thing together.\r\n\r\nAll
    that said, I'm not sure you really need the bug...at least not used at the same
    time with the logotype. The logotype seems sufficiently unique to stand on its
    own."

  body: I agree with aluminum about not needing the bug. logotype really has a unique
    presence and style. slanting the 'y' and 'p' might also create a sense of moving
    forward/progress etc. currently i don't like the space created by the slanted
    'y' next to the 'p'. good luck.

  body: "Arun,\r\n\r\nWhat you pointed out is particularly what I was worried about.
    However, I don't know the right way to fix the heaviness without breaking any
    type rules or making it look disproportionate. Any suggestions on how to make
    the 'y' less heavy while still keeping the proportions? \r\nRight now, the 'y'
    has the same thickness as the other stems.\r\n\r\nThanks for the replies so far.

  body: "You could use the method of Melior\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=melior\r\n\r\nor
    try bringing the apex of the y counter down, or curving the stem and in the process
    narrowing it. Although the stems don't have to be the same weight it isn't a monoline
    style.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\nEDIT: we cross-posted your curved y is working far better."

  body: "For optical correction it's nearly impossible to tell in a gif at this size.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    your e's look like they have issues:\r\nThe thickness of the top horizontal and
    the crossbar look reversed. The crossbar needs to be thinner and the top thicker.
    The counter of the e should start roughtly in the same place as the counter of
    the p. So just lower the counter a bit to start with and then cheat it if you
    have to. And the overbite is a little severe.\r\n\r\nAlso, on the curved-tail
    y version: consider relating the bottom counter of the e and the counter between
    the tail and body. Probably need to shrink the x-height a bit and increase the
    descenders a hear too.\r\n\r\nIf you do go with the diagonal y, you'll want to
    make the left side slightly thicker than the right side. That way they will look
    even. And drop the crotch a little bit (or cheat it with a curved crotch if you
    prefer). \r\n\r\nYou could also try the diagonal y with a curved tail that echos
    the e. But my guess is that won't work.\r\n\r\nWould they consider changing their
    name to Kellipipe? :-) "
