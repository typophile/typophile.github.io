body: "How can I use for example the glyph name \"rcaron.terminal\" which has no Unicode
  value in HTML? or any other such case? Is it even possible? I think it must be surely
  but I got no clue. \r\n\r\nIt's easy for regular letters like the glyph \"\xDF\"
  where I would just type \"&#xDF\" and get that character or \"&#223\" (same result)
  but for glyphs without any Unicode value I don't know what I'm supposed to do...?
  I've tried also &rcaron.terminal; but nothing, where as something like \"&hearts\"
  would work giving a heart glyph of god knows what font, probably Arial I dunno.
  \r\n\r\nDo I need to use state some specific encoding aside from ANSI in my html
  document?\r\n\r\nie. < meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;charset=ISO-8859-8\"
  > or something... like Im really lost lol\r\n\r\nAll I found on the net was this
  http://text-symbols.com/html/unicode/ but I cant find any more info so I came here.
  \r\n\r\nPlease help! Thanks! :)\r\n"

    glyphs in websites directly. \r\nBut unencoded glyphs are usually connected to
    an OpenType feature. So you can call that and the browser might substitute the
    regular Unicode-encoded glyph with that unencoded glyph, if it supports that feature.
