  body: If a font already has such a ligature, you can generally activate it by using
    the "discretionary ligatures" (dlig) OpenType feature. The program you're using
    has to support OpenType.

  body: "This might turn into an interesting challenge for you. First of all, there's
    no standard \"shortcut\" for the c_t ligature. Second, *if* a font has the c_t
    ligature, that glyph will be either <strong>un</strong>encoded or encoded in the
    PUA block because that ligature is not part of the Unicode repertoire (unlike
    the s_t ligature at U+FB06 and other ligatures that were encoded for compatibility
    reasons).\r\n\r\nThen, assuming the font has the c_t ligature, there are two scenarios:\r\n1.
    If the glyph was encoded in the PUA block, you'll be able to insert it in most
    applications (e.g. Word, InDesign) and you're likely to find it at codepoint U+E077.

    example of a font with encoded c_t ligature is Adobe Garamond Pro]]\r\n\r\n2.
    If the glyph was not encoded, you will need an OpenType-savvy application (e.g.
    Illustrator, InDesign) to access it. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/arno/|An
    example of a font with <strong>un</strong>encoded c_t ligature is Arno Pro]]\r\nNote:
    unencoded glyphs are not accessible via Windows Character Map, nor via Mac OS
    X Character Palette."
