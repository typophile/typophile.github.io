body: "Meaning my other place in Amsterdam. The lady and I have spent the last three
  days doing a lot of little chores, like putting up curtains, cleaning, etcetera.
  And some major stuff, like (trying to) connect some radiators. That didn\u2019t
  work out like I would have liked; the guys that were supposed to do this kind of
  walked out on us \u2014 so we are getting professional help. If everything works
  out, it will be fixed next week: hot water at last!\r\n\r\nFinishing this five\u2013month\u2013project
  means that I will finally have time to pursue my longtime wish of designing a comprehensive
  type family. But first (and mostly as a way to learn the intricacies of working
  with FontLab) I plan to finish a revival I started about six years ago. Maybe more
  about that later\u2026"
