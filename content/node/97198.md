body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone recognized this type which appeared in
  a Russian book (Tango with Cows) in 1914. I think it is probably wood due to its
  size, but also I think that probably is based on a German design for roman (all
  the other types in the book have roman equivalents which were manufactured [if not
  originally designed by] german foundries.).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
