  body: "What Tomi is trying to say, is that this appears as a purely geometric shape,
    which happens to share similarities with a T. But, almost certainly it isn't a
    font.\r\n\r\n(You could find similar shaped Ts looking for \"slab serif\", but
    you'll notice that all will sport some sort of foot)"

  body: "Welcome to Typophile Brent. If you have lurked here a while you will realize
    that we get all kinds of requests, and we don't always know if someone is trying
    to play with us, so I can see where Tomi's response came from, especially on April
    Fool's Day.\r\n\r\nYou will also realize, if you spend any time here, that we
    are generally very helpful if we get anything to work with, and if your question
    is honest.\r\n\r\nOne last point: please try to make your titles more descriptive,
    so that we know which one we are looking for if we find an answer sometime well
    after the post first appears. You can see if everyone says some variation of \"I
    need help\" we would never know which thread to pick up. If you give something
    that describes your sample, like \"Slab T with no foot serif\", we would always
    find it again, if we located an answer. Also, it's good to know if you have other
    letters -- the more information you give us the more it helps.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    of why I've always found you to be a class act.
