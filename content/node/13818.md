  opened its virtual doors today:\r\n\r\n\"Village is a type co-op. We are the union
  of nine (soon to be twelve) young type foundries who have decided to go it alone,
  together. vllg.com is the information channel and boutique storefront for this group
  of equals.\"\r\n\r\nThe nine foundries are: Feliciano Type Foundry (M\xE1rio Feliciano),
  Joshua Darden, KLTF (Karsten L\xFCcke), Lux Typographics (Michael Rey, Greg Lindy),
  Orange Italic (Christian Schwartz), Thirstype (founded by Rick Valicenti, with contributions
  from Barry Deck, Magnus Rakeng, Patric King, chester, Frank Ford, Patrick Giasson,
  Claudio Piccinini, and soon Hugo d\u2019Alte), Type Initiative (Michail Semoglou,
  Keith Chi-hang Tam), Underware (Akiem Helmling, Bas Jacobs, Sami Kortem\xE4ki) and
  Village (chester, Tracy Jenkins). According to the site, \"Village is the 'house
  brand' and founding member of the type collective.\"\r\n\r\nSome <em>beautiful</em>
  typefaces are or soon will be available, some of them for the first time to the
  type community at large, including <a href=\"http://vllg.com/OrangeItalic/\" target=\"new\">Local
  Gothic</a> by Orange Italic (first conceived in 1999 and used in the TypeCon 2005
  identity) and the long-awaited <a href=\"http://vllg.com/Lux/Crank8/Example+About/\"
  target=\"new\">Crank 8</a> by Lux Typographics (seen originally in <em>Esquire</em>
  magazine). Wow.\r\n\r\nEdit: I just took a closer look at <a href=\"http://vllg.com/KLTF/Litteratra/mudTyper+Weights/\"
  target=\"new\">Litteratra</a>, by Karsten L\xFCcke. It has to be seen to be believed!"

  body: Amazing stuff. Tangentially, this raises a question I've had for some time.
    Pricing. The very attractive <em>Litteratra</em> has a price tag of $135 per license.
    While I'm sure it is worth every penny, there are equally amazing fonts sold for
    prices in the $20-40 range. I read the license and it seems very user friendly.
    So, how do they arrive at this number? I mean, if a foundry produces an excellent
    text face and lets it go for $30/weight and BigPublishingCo. purchases two or
    three licenses and sets the next Harry Potter book in that face, shouldn't the
    foundry be paid more than say TheLittleGuyCo who uses it to print a run of 1000
    pamphlets? Likewise, if MassiveRetailCo hires a hip new firm to handle there next
    international ad campaign, and the hip new firm purchases a hip new display face
    on MyFonts for $29.95, isn't the designer/foundry being ripped off? The whole
    workstations model of licensing seems flawed. That $135 buys you the right to
    have 4 copies of <em>Litteratra</em> installed but says nothing about how many
    eyeballs see it. If it's used for a local marketing strategy and 100,000 people
    see it or if it's used for a national campaign and 1,000,000 people see it the
    price is the same? That doesn't seem right. So how does this stuff work?

  body: "Beautiful! I'll be browsing often...and hopefully licensing soon.\r\n\r\nMy
    thoughts on font pricing: I agree that it doesn't seem logical, but I don't think
    anyone would be able to adequately control the licenses, audit their use, or apply
    accountability very well. Print runs are often client-driven, not designer-driven.
    If the client bumps the print quantity up, but doesn't tell the designer (the
    license purchaser), that puts everyone in an awkward position financially and
    legally. Plus, people are accustomed to the current model, which favors their
    convenience, so I don't think a change would work too well. Isn't there a foundry
    that's testing a per-word traditional typesetting model where you pay a much lower
    per-character fee for an EPS of a headline or word set in their font? That seems
    like a more reasonable approach to making font commerce easier/more affordable
    for everyone. In the case of Literatra, imaybe it has to do with expected sales?
    Lower, more rarified demand means less repeats of per-unit profit, so they bump
    up the price to compensate? Text fonts don't really work individually, they require
    italics, etc., whereas Literatra is complete as-is? Maybe? Dunno.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    I write all of this as a type consumer, not a producer/retailer."

  body: "Litteratra has about 1900 glyphs, so I think it is worth the price.\r\n\r\nConsider
    this against some other fonts with enormous character sets. Linotype's <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/57056/palatinolinotype-family.html\">Palatino
    Linotype</a> has 1325 glyphs per weight. Each wight costs 99 dollars (or Euros),
    before taxes. <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/48344/helveticalinotype-family.html\">Helvetica
    Linotype's</a> weights cost the same, but have 1866 glyphs per weight.\r\n\r\nA
    \"normal\" font has 256 characters, and costs about $25. Maybe $21 at MyFonts.com.\r\n\r\n1900
    divided by 256 is almost 7.5 (and just 7 x $20 would be $140).\r\n\r\nIf Karsten
    were working with old \"expert fonts,\" you'd have to buy at least seven fonts
    to get what you get in just one now. And just one font is way more convenient
    for the user than seven. So actually, I think that the price for Litteratra is
    fair, considering what you get!\r\n\r\nPlus, Karsten <em>is</em> the \"little
    guy.\" He doesn't have a team of glyph drawers or OpenType programmers to help
    him out. If I remember correctly, this typeface has been in production for at
    least five years! I don't think it would be fair to expect him to sell a font\u2014which
    very few fonts on the market can match in terms of capabilities, BTW\u2014for
    just around $30. That isn't the direction that other \"real\" OpenType fonts are
    going in either.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"
