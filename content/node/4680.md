  body: 'Hmmm. I think I see a pattern here. An interesting piece of graphic design
    around an uninterestingly derivative typeface. <BR> <BR>One wonders what the tragedy
    is supposed to be: what Michael Jackson has done, what he has become, or both?
    Being not very familiar with Jackson&#39;s visual style, I also wonder if the
    glasses are supposed to evoke Jackson, or perhaps Lennon? <BR> <BR>T'

  body: Thank you for the comment.   <BR>I just made a game with Michael Jackson,
    for the process of surgeries it ended up turning a tragedy. Your metamorphosis
    in wanting to be something divine or saint.   <BR>The glasses were alone for giving
    a grace in the visual. <BR>Thanx!!!!! <BR> <BR>Marcio

  body: Hi, Daniel. <BR>I agree with you on the type grunge to be of the past.Although
    I don&#39;t agree in that grunge &#34; classification. The past subject or present
    is also relative, some works not demand a type dirtier, other.   <BR>I thank the
    comment. <BR> <BR>Thanx <BR> <BR>Marcio
