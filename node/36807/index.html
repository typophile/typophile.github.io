I'm kind of assuming that the new iPod UI uses TrueType like the iPhone and the Zune, so maybe the iTunes store will provide fonts as well as ring-tones and episodes of Lost? If not I'm sure the font hacks will be on their way soon.

They should have put that 160gb hard drive inside the Touch so there would be a reason to buy it. You can only access the internet when you're near a computer or a wifi network. But what about when I look up stuff when I'm driving? Can't. That's for the iphone. Poor execution on Steve's part. As it stands, I'm waiting for the iphone to have bluetooth, real GPS, 3g, tmobile, take video, and be about $200. In the mean time I'll wait.</div>

However, it provides a useful comparison with the iPod text. We may bitch about the presence of Helvetica, but the quality of text on this high-res monitor is much more acceptable. 

At some point, probably within 2 years, Apple will offer a larger device that's more of a reader/PDA/touchscreen multi-purpose device. That's what the iPhone is a prototype for. At that point, they'll offer books for download. And I imagine they'll look quite good on a 200-ppi display. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">It would be interesting if Apple were to get into eBooks using this type of device and the iTunes store to deliver the DRM'd content. I'd love to agree with you that they'll go that way, but I'm not convinced books are considered cool enough. I wonder if they are looking beyond the browser with its PDF style pan, scan and zoom interface to a page based interface, like the NYT Reader. Also although it’s great to see all those Microsoft, Linotype and Monotype fonts on the iPhone I would have thought if eBooks were on their radar they’d be investing in screen type, and revisiting their rendering philosophy – I suppose they still have time to go there, but my magic 8-ball says ‘signs point to no.’ I guess we'll have to wait and see.    </div>

I get the argument that a device that weighs less than a book can hold a whole bunch of books and it will certainly save some trees, but do you really want to bring it to the beach? Or give it to a friend when you're done.

This is of course from a gal who makes her living in publishing...

		<div class="commentbody">But their screen rendering philosophy is changing in a couple months with the next OS release: resolution-independent type. That alone calms most of the complaints about Apple's "blurry" type. Apple's type is only blurry when it's scaled outside of native resolution. Then add more than double the current standard resolution, plus their propensity for highly esthetic templates (Pages, Keynote).... There is more than one way to solve the problem you are describing.</div>

Sure the tecnhincal issues can all be solved, but the 'problem' is that books are dull, and movies and music are cool. If anyone can make books cool, it's Apple, I guess.</div>

Actually, in this respect, Tiger already has it.  You can turn on resolution independence in Tiger but type is about the only thing that scales cleanly. This picture shows Safari running at 144, with the UI Rez window running at 72.   http://media.arstechnica.com/images/tiger/safari-scaled-2x-big.jpg

Apple DOES have a new type technology, although in part it could just be a rebranding of existing technology.  However, I don't have a beta of Leopard, and so beyond knowing of CoreText via random clues on Apple's site, I don't have a clue exactly what it is (I joined the Apple mailing list for it, but there haven't been any posts at all).  Maybe they'll be supporting more OT features, but until it's released I'd imagine only the Adobe folks on the forum here would know, and they can't say anything about it.  Given what CoreAnimation, CoreImage, CoreAudio, etc, brought to earlier versions, decent speculation could be made.

We should also consider all of the electricity (i.e., in many cases generated by carbon) that computers use, all of the growing piles of non-biodegradable obsolete gadgets, all of the discarded old computers and printers, all of the used toner cartridges, all of the dumped, non-rechargable batteries, all of the non-recyclable plastic used for those gadgets.</div>

When you start to look at the big picture -- the consequences that our way of life, work, production, etc., have on the planet -- it's a little daunting. But if we don't look at the big picture and take some serious steps to reverse the damage we have been inflicting on natural resources, wildlife, forests, etc., then we stand a good chance of causing our own extinction, and taking a lot of plant and animal species out with us. So much for our supposed intelligence.</div>
