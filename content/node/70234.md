  body: "The lower sample seems to be from a mix of fonts, with some additional editing.
    See <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/envision/\">Envision</a>, and <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/percolator/\">Percolator</a>, and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/percolator/\">Democratica</a>
    for some possible sources. Other letters may be from 'normal' fonts that have
    had bits removed.\r\n\r\n\"Hans Martin Buff\" reminds me of some of the Letraset
    'color' fonts, like Pink, Green and Orange, although they turn out to only be
    similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
