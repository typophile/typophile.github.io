  main designer about a year ago and we need to know the font/s he used for our logo.
  He had told us once before, we lost all the fonts we had around the same time he
  left. We're not exactly on speaking terms now, so we can't just ask. We believe
  it's two different fonts. With Absolute and Wrestling being one and Intense being
  another. Any help would be a huge help, so we can make new designs and projects
  and such. \r\n\r\nThanks, and have a good day. "

    like Chiller:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/chiller/\r\n\r\nnot
    the same, i know, but in the same vein...\r\n\r\nnot that i am recommending using
    this...\r\n\r\ni really thing you could do a lot better!"

  body: Yuck. Yeah, I would spend your money on hiring a designer (rather than new
    fonts) to revise your identity.

    Collection]].  INTENSE is \"Slawterhouse\" and the rest is \"Firehouse\".\r\nConsidering
    the cost of the collection, I think the advice you have been getting is worth
    considering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
