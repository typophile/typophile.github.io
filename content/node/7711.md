  for my city. It would include various signs of various sizes, maps, city guides
  etc. For some reason nobody has done it yet, and if you are first time in our city
  and want to go somewhere using the public transportation, you can easily get lost
  in 5 mins. I have been in Berlin and London, where they have quite beautifully designed
  public transportation navigation systems and would love to have one for my city.
  <BR> <BR>So I have started writing a proposal for the appropriate public persons
  and want to include several samples of how the system should/would look like. And
  of course I need the typeface for it. It should have be readable in small sizes
  and from large distances and preferably usable in setting book size type as well.  <BR>
  <BR>Our traffic sign system used Helvetica for some time and then switched to DIN.
  I have seen few signs set in Alternate Gothic as well. I don&#39;t like any of those
  choices. <BR> <BR>Are there any publicly available typefaces designed specifically
  for environment navigation? What would you suggest?'

  body: Maija, good luck with your project! Writing a cold-call proposal takes guts
    and talent. <BR> <BR>It seems to me that your choice of type will depend on how
    Baltic it&#39;s supposed to look, versus how Eurogeneric. Are the [potential]
    clients self-assured Latvian Europeans, or insecure wannabe Western-Europeans?
    <BR> <BR>Keith? I presume he got himself a life.  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'How Baltic it is supposed to look... Hmm.. see, here we come to the huge
    problem of our lack of self-definition. Apart from having almost none true &#34;utilitarian&#34;
    graphic design culture as such, we don&#39;t have an established country identity
    as well - apart from the &#39;quite sweet yet good for nothing&#39; concept called
    &#39;country that sings&#39;... It&#39;s the result of our post-soviet situtation,
    where everybody who can is busy getting rich as fast as possible and others just
    don&#39;t care, as &#39;everything is decided by someone else anyway&#39;. As
    I understand that Hrant is from Armenia, he could have quite a precise picture
    of the whole taste of the situtation. So &#39;insecure wannabe Western-Europeans&#39;
    is certainly the case.  <BR> <BR>The problem is that I expect the client to have
    no understanding of the problem and means of solving it whatsoever. So if I get
    that far, most of the energy will be spent on arguing that the design of the traffic
    is necessary as such. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll see any difference between
    Arial and Arrival, even if I print out 72 pt samples and wave them in front of
    their noses &#40;see the &#39;typeface for museum&#39; thread&#41;. You see, type
    is just something that comes with your computer and is seen in Microsoft Word
    &#39;Font&#39; box and there are three kinds of them: arial-like, timesnewroman-like
    and comicsans-like. Apart from that all letters look the same. No kidding, that
    is the common perception of type here, and explaining why it&#39;s much more than
    that is a tremendous work... and all the public persons feel extremely important,
    as they have power, but I don&#39;t, so I&#39;m their servant, not the other way
    round.. a soviet heritage, too. <BR> <BR>So, as we ourselves don&#39;t know what
    Baltic means, then what I would like to have is a well designed  and constructed,
    highly functional face. &#40;And then I start to think, who defined what: did
    the London Underground font define the sense of &#39;british looking type&#39;
    or the other way round? I guess I should do some reading of how those other designers
    came to their solutions...&#41; <BR> <BR>I saw samples of Arrival, when its design
    was discussed on this board somewhen earlier. I like Clearview better, because
    I find it to be much more versatile, although its certain &#39;Interstatiness&#39;
    leaves me wanting for something... a little different? Little more humanist? But
    it&#39;s a good design with its positive/negative contrast adjustments, perception
    tests, many weights and all. And Interstate here is far less overused than in
    US, after all.'

  body: '&#62; Hrant is from Armenia <BR> <BR>Real quick: I am Armenian, but I&#39;ve
    only been in Armenia once &#40;for 9 weeks&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; that is the common
    perception of type here <BR> <BR>This problem exists anywhere, just to different
    degrees. <BR> <BR>&#62; we ourselves don&#39;t know what Baltic means <BR> <BR>Is
    it possible you don&#39;t formally &#34;know&#34;, but you still <i>feel</i> it?
    <BR>&#34;Balticness&#34; must exists, it&#39;s just a matter of finding it. <BR>
    <BR>I believe that abstract shapes are part of culture &#40;even lacking a general
    awareness/respect of graphic design per se&#41;, so you might try to uncover the
    shapes &#40;and colors&#41; inheret to your culture. This reminds me of my recent
    trip to Novosibirsk, consulting for the corporate identity design for a Russian
    bank: during the visit it became clear to us that they needed something somewhat
    &#34;ethnic&#34; &#40;we arrived at something derived from the shape of the classic
    Russian birch tree leaf - which also looks like the wonderful onion domes on their
    curches&#41; in order to alleviate the general mistrust in banking among the people
    &#40;which causes them to keep their savings under the bed&#41;, while the bosses
    wanted something that looked like a French spaceship.  :-/ <BR> <BR>If you can
    harness the feeling of Balticness, and apply it properly, you might manage to
    strike a very fruitful chord even in an overall functional/generic approach. <BR>

  body: Fortunately, the British Transport Department isn&#39;t as ruthless as it
    likes to think and there are still many old-style signs around, especially in
    rural areas. <BR>Taking on the project of designing a signage system for a city
    must be good for a designer, but if the city implements this kind of scheme fully,
    it might destroy some of the feel of the place - the atmosphere that grows on
    a place without anyone noticing, as elements of new design mingle with old established
    features. <BR>While I understand why the MoT adopted Kinneir and Calvert
