body: Does anyone have any suggestions for a serif font that pairs well with DIN?
  I'm looking for something that works well as body copy paired with a DIN headline.
  I read some of the earlier posts on DIN/serif pairs, but was wondering if anyone
  has found something else...thanks for any and all suggestions...

  body: quite a few of the older serifs make an interesting contrast with din's clinical
    nature... try bodoni, baskerville, garamond, caslon and see if it fits your purpose
