    could find the original font in an old book.

      found the font. Its a freeware font called Tricorne Display using all the uppercase
      letters.\r\n"

  body: Tricorne might look like the font that was used on the album art, but keep
    it mind this was designed before digital fonts existed, so it's only an emulation
    of the original, and might not be a good one if it's free.

  body: Tricorne was Southern Software's "version" of Novel Gothic (see Angel71's
    post above). If SSi was true to form, the font was a renamed ripoff of someone
    else's font.
