body: "I've been sitting on this font ID question for several years now, clearly not
  trying very hard to solve it, but every once in a while it gnaws at me, so this
  is the day I post it. This is the logotype of a (now defunct) Spanish Motorcycle
  company which was quite successful in the late 60s and 70s. I'm sure that their
  particular logotype is a custom cut, in fact there are significant differences (typographically
  speaking) in the letterforms on the gas cap vs. the tank badge vs. the engine cases.\r\n\r\nThat
  said I have seen a font (or fonts) very similar to this on a bumper sticker or some
  Motorcycle mag ad from time to time and it always re-sparks the \"what font is that?\"
  question.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bultaco_5412.jpg]"

  body: "Hey! You've done it, thanks!\r\n\r\nI actually created my own complete typeface-interpretation
    of this logotype as part of my application to Design School a number of years
    ago (without knowing there was already a font like this). As it was the first
    type I'd ever designed it was built to a rigid grid (rather than making visual
    adjustments for letters) - but still a fun experiment.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
