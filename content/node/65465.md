  to submit a request for a coworker. She's been asked to recreate a very simple type
  design--for a quick-turnaround offset print job that needs a speedy diagnosis. She
  tried many variations of classic serif faces, but couldn't get the \"C\" or the
  \"T\" quite right. I didn't have any further suggestions off the top of my head.
  Also, is this semibold in weight?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help!\r\n\r\n(.pdf
