  Luc crediting me for it months ago. This features the first 200 of the 1300 glyphs
  or so, meaning no international scripts, swatches or other such goodies. I've incorporated
  the feed back from mentioning this previously, but now you can look at a fuller
  map, or download and play with it.\r\n\r\nParticularly, I'm interested in people's
  impressions on the relationship of x-height to overall size. However, I look forwards
  to your thoughts and comments in general, as I work on to release the very expanded
  version in 1Q07. \r\n\r\nDL available @:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/11970?text=Quick%20Brown%20Fox\">http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/11970?text=Quick%20Brown%20Fox</a>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dididididi_4964.jpg]"

  body: It's very 'rollerball'. What about softening up the curves so they are bigger?
    Especially on the inside of shapes. But in general too. What about opening up
    the spaces slighly - between shapes inletters and between letters too. I think
    these changes would make the face more accessible. I don't know that that's your
    goal, but...

    body: "My inspiration includes 1970's paperback novels, so 'Rollerball' comparisons
      means I am near the mark. I was shooting for funky, retro, dense and distinct
      to come to mind. Readability is desirable, but not so much.\r\n\r\nAfter I build
      the skeleton of the OpenType feature set, I plan to run out a few iterations,
      including one with larger (and interior) curves. \r\n\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.chozcunningham.com\">Choz

  body: "I'll try posting this again.\r\n\r\nInspirations include not only 70's era
    del ray pulp sci fi paperback covers, and B-movie boxes, but those corny 1980's
    \"computer age\" fonts, and Marilyn Manson's Mechanical Animals. Intended uses
    could be for sci-fi posters, retro geek-chic material, or just for where one wants
    to inject a funky in-yo-face look. \r\n\r\nThe original hand-lettering this was
    built from was actually created just before Mechanical Animals was released, but
    the album's spirit matched well, and a recent listening helped inspire the overall
    look.  Also, I did make a point of looking closely at my own bookshelf to make
    sure !Disc Inferno brought a far more modern look than a 30 year revival would
    have.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mm sampler copy_3742.jpg]\r\n\r\n<A

  body: "Hmmm, I suppose I wouldn't be posting it here after release if I wasn't dissatisfied
    in some way, would I? I think it is this:\r\n\r\nI enjoy not only the connotation,
    but I also enjoy the details, when I look at an entire word. However, any more
    than one word, and the legibility seems to drop. A lot. Why, if we read by word
    shape? Should the leading or the size of the space be altered? Is there a way
    to get a flow between words that is as fun as that between letters?\r\n\r\nI guess
    what I am looking for is a critique of metrics, not glyphs.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hownowbrowncow_6389.jpg]\r\n\r\n<A

  body: I bet even a small increase in interletter spacing would pay. What if you
    got rid of the diagonals? They seem arbitrairy ( except in the case of the Cap
    N) and are probably not helping the face to read. Instead, I think probably distract.
    You could add them to glyphs where you expect them like with the K. Or eliminate
    them altogether. What happens if you make the heavy area swith sides & be on the
    left? What if you drop the middle of the W? What if all the forms were based on
    lower case? There is more variety of form there. What if some of the shapes were
    based on unical?

  body: "I don't know about getting rid of the diagonals, the only letters that don't
    have to have them are V/W. The X and the D needed them for legibility. And then
    I felt a couple more helped them get on with the more angular shapes.\r\n\r\nI
    suspect that your assessment on the outer curves is right. I blurred some text
    and it helped. I haven't experimented with the inter-letter spacing, yet. If it
    works, I can't yet imagine why (not that I won't try it anyhow).\r\n\r\nThe thick
    strip on the left is harder to read for some reason. Shorter mid-W is a winner.\r\n\r\nI
    think uncial letters would complicate the font too much, if I am imagining them
    correctly. Might try that last. :) \r\n\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.chozcunningham.com\">Choz

  body: When you have the next edition will you show it? When you make letters with
    such strong rules I imagine it's hard to start breaking them. But I think that
    judicious rule breaking is what gives the best faces their tension & interest.
    Good luck!

    It's kinda like dating. I will post a new edition with some tweaks, but I will
    probably have to fiddle with spacing some more first.\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.chozcunningham.com\">Choz
