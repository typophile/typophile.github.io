  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">"Now" is the "other" face I have been working on since Typecon (I alluded to it in my posting of "Align")
I started it with the capitals, trying to achieve classical Roman proportions in a light monoline sans serif. I then did the small caps since I like to use caps and small caps together in heads and subheads. The caps, with or without small caps, might be usable as inscriptions when used alone but my intention from the start was for the lower case to be a text face. The proportions of the lowercase follow Roman as well.
For Now, I have only done the Light weight.  The other weights will follow.
Below is a quicky GIF and I have also attached a PDF showing text sizes down to 6 point in several languages (English, German, French, Italian, Czech, and Polish.)
OTF features include ligs, small caps, oldstyle figures, and fractions built from the nom/denom.
The Now name and Time concept come out of the use of classical proportions in the context of present-day sans serif.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks for your help!  I will look, at the M.  I think it is the points on top but it tricks me at different sizes. What about the W?
Yes, for you, a dotless lig :-)
The "ri" has always been my nemisis.  I ended up doing an calt r in "Align" just to get around that issue.  I may have to do the same for "Now".
Maybe bothe the R and P bowel are shy? I'll putz with it.

3 (lining and ranging) -- the top bowl seems to be too far to the left. OR the entire shape is skewed to far to the left.

W -- in the word NOW the O looks too small, being surrounded by all of those spikes. maybe the W is too wide as well. Does it hang lower than the O?</div>

Thanks for taking a peek!

I didn't want it to be like Futura. I was avoiding the geometric quality. I wanted a more humanist approach but not a revival or even an attempt at an inspiration from another face. I could add monocular alt a and g for those who might want it though. Mostly, I have always wanted a monoline sans that had a Roman feel and that is the impetus I had to begin the project. Futura is too Bau Haus to fit the bill.

I thought about the cap "I" but when I tried it seriffed, it looked too foreign to the rest of the caps. The lc "L" has hooked exit stroke. Maybe a seriffed cap "I" would get confused with that as well?

Now that I've looked the PDF the f looks a little strange to me as well. It is really the only glyph that you've narrowed the tip. I am not talking change it completely. I can see that overall it works with the design. I could be wrong.

I kept narrowing the f because it looked dark at small sizes (especially the ff ligs).  This may be my laser printer.  I will have to get a Lino one of these days to see what is what. 

I am still having trouble seeing the tilt to the right on the 3s both you and Dan Reynolds see. To me it seems tilted the other direction--maybe I need a few beers or at least a Mexican coffee to be able to see straight (or is it crooked:-)

The lower case is more "this is now" with semi-condensed, even-width forms.

But really, those aren't "era" features, but basic proportions. Renner mixed classic caps with neo lower case, but synthesized them with a corresponding variance of letter-width, and a uniformity of curve shape.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Chris,

This design is very attractive. I think you are on to something very nice with the caps. Really, everything looks good, but I think the direction you started with is very strong and should be honored. 

Lowercase is very nice, but consider matching the lc proportions more to the caps. They can be wider, looser, and still work in small sizes; in fact the additional air might improve readability. Please consider trying out some wider versions of abcdehkmnopqruyz. If this sounds inappropriate or uncomfortable, see Legacy Sans lowercase. I only suggest it to keep the majestic lapidary feel of the caps throughout. Right now, the lc looks like a different design than the caps. 

I think that your r is suffering from too much attention. I agree with Dan, it is too narrow. The issue of ambiguity will never go away completely, not in a clean, lapidary sans like this. See the r of Skia for an idea. It needs to have more width to be recognizable in text. if ri combos are bothersome, consider removing the spur from the i (and j). This convention from "info sans" designs seems foreign and mundane in such a stately design. i already has a dot keeping it unambiguous, and your l is differentiated, so maybe the ri combo problems are just a mirage. Try it with a simplified i and r. A ti ligature isn't a good enough reason to keep a feature that is interfering with basic combinations. 

I think your digital sign mock-up is a good illustration of the potential for this design. I want some of this for my house numbers! It's a very pleasing, open, architectural look and I think it is possible to carry that through into the lowercase. See Stellar, Legacy Sans, and Metro for some alternative approaches. Bo Berndal tried something similar with Naniara a while back; see if he solved any of the problems you are facing now. 

I like your U a lot too. It does seem a smidge pointy; maybe the lower right join could be brought up just a hair, making the angle less sharp. I would then try to soften the same feature of G. That area looks so square in the context of the rest of the caps. 

I think if you re-shape the f and j hooks to be more like arches, they will harmonize better. I know you've built a lot of ligatures already, but I find these 2 letters don't fit as well. j, f, r, and even t look a little like they are being starved. The caps and other lc are so graceful and open; keep this throughout. 

All my comments are intended to help you eliminate inappropriate or stiff features, because I think the caps are so beautiful and strong, it's a very worthwhile direction to follow. I think it's got great potential. Getting the lc might be difficult, but I know you are not looking for something easy, or else you would be playing Nintendo. I don't know if anyone has done a lapidary sans with such stately caps, and matched it well with lowercase. Be the first! 

Very exciting work! Please keep us posted. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Carl,
Thanks for taking the time to comment so thoroughly!
The lower case started out wider and looser a few weeks ago.  Since then, as the tinkering continued, it tightened up to correct holes in the color. 
I think you might be right about the ri.  It is the horizontal of the i which crashes into the r.  I will try one straight up.  The ti lig was put in to correct a similar failing in the t next to i.  I did not start off with the ti lig in mind and am not married to it so if it goes, I won't cry:-)
The join of the U was up higher before but tended to get lost so I pulled it down some.  I will take another look at it.  
I am a bit confused by your comment: "but I find these 2 letters don’t fit as well. j, f, r, and even t look a little like they are being starved."  You mention 2 letters but name three.  Did you mean the 3 letters in combination with each other?
I will also take a look at the faces you mentioned as examples!

Thanks for your help!

That's what I thought you meant.  

"...better not fixed. I still see the 3 as being skewed in comparison to the other figs."

Strangely, I see the 3s as skewed too much to the left instead of the right.
I am attaching a GIF which has "Now" at the top followed by a few other fonts. The red lines on the first showing of the 3s indicate how my eyes see the lean. The other fonts pictured look more sloped to the right than my "Now" does to me.  Am I misunderstanding you or am I really in need of new glasses?

		<div class="commentbody">I am posting a GIF file comparing several light sans faces in caps and lc. "Now" and Futura are in black while the rest are grey. I am looking at not only proportions, but how geometric (or not) the faces are. I threw in Trajan as a comparison to classical and Dax as straight out contemporary sans. 
Nick is right about the likeness of the curves holding Futura together. Futura's proportions are by far the most extreme--even more so than Trajan. I do feel that what makes the curves hold as family is their geometric nature though. Now that I look at the "M" I made for "Now", it does look a lot like the Futura "M" as noted by Nick.
"Now" does appear to be closer to classical Roman titles to me than Futura does though.  That is not by any means a fault in Futura. It is perfect the way that it is.  I am just noting the comparison as a non-qualitative observation.
At any rate, take a look and see what you all see in the comparison without my bias :-)

		<div class="commentbody">Chris,

I think it's fine to look at so many other faces. I assumed you would do that anyway. One thing I find so intriguing and pleasant about your design is that it has some of the proportions of something grand like Trajan, while also having some of the serene quality of a monoline geometric sans. blending those styles is an interesting experiment. I think Metro, as mentioned before, is a good example of that kind of synthesis, and I recall also a titling face Jonathan Hoefler made (Topaz) that has some of this too. I believe that Thomas Finney's yet-unreleased design is also intended to harness some of the simplicity of Futura while offering more humanist flexibility. Maybe he would give us a peek?....

I do also think the 3 looks tilted.  ;D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Carl,
I make it a point not to look at other typefaces (particularly ones of the same ilk) so that I don't get that image burned into my mind and just repeat it. Now that I am far enough along and my type has its own voice, I can look at the older members of the choir without accidentally singing in their key.
"One thing I find so intriguing and pleasant about your design is that it has some of the proportions of something grand like Trajan, while also having some of the serene quality of a monoline geometric sans."
That was exactly my intention except for the geometric part. There are no regular or compass-made curves.
As I tried to say in the first post (but not as poetically as you said), "I started it with the capitals, trying to achieve classical Roman proportions in a light monoline sans serif. "

I think Thomas Phinney's sans is a geometric.  I don't think Adobe would let him post it here before it's released by them. I am sure it will have major cool OTF features though. Thomas is a code writing monster machine:-)

I do like the figures in both forms, and I agree with André with not throwing out the "3" just yet. It looks more "normal" when straightened, but there is something of unique potential that I see in the tipped figure, especially in the old style "3".

It may be worth a few more refinements, and I don't believe it is just in it's axis. Set it aside for a while (as you always have the option of a straightened version).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris,

I think your new face is coming along very nicely. The overall look and spacing is looking good. The only suggestions I can think of making have to do with picky details.

I would do the top of the f more like the top of the a. There is something unbalanced about it to my eye. The a doesn't have the problem.

There are some other terminal strokes that have a similar problem, such as the tail of the y and l.

The ends of the stroke on the s would look better to me if they were perpendicular to the angle of the stroke, rather than oblique to it. More like the top right of the S. (I would change the bottom of the S in the same way.)

Overall, there are some inconsistencies in the stroke terminals--some are perpendicular to the stroke angle, some are oblique, some are perpendicular to the baseline. There's nothing wrong with having some variety, but it seems a bit arbitrary to me.

I can see why you are putting that little bend in the i and j, but I think it will call unnecessary attention to itself at display sizes.

The absence of the lefthand stroke on the f and t bugs me, but I if you feel it is important to the design, don't change it. Putting the strokes in would make it look more "normal" which may or may not be what you want.

I think you ti ligature needs the i dot.

The curves at the bottoms of the l and t need some work. I would try to make them flow more smoothly around the curve.

All for now. More later if I think of anything else.</div>

Mark, I will take a closer look at the terminals.  I think you are right about the dot in the ti lig. I very much appreciate your "expert" eye.
André, I am glad the 3 appeals to you.  It was driving me crazy :-)
Thank you both for the encouragement!

		<div class="commentbody">Mark, See my last PDF. It is new.
I have made all the changes you suggested except for adding the left bar on the f.
I redid all the terminals to make them perpendicular to the stroke; I made the f, t, y, and j curve like the top of the a.  I therefore had to redo all my ligs to match.

I think you were right about all.  It is a definite improvement.  Let me know what you think?

A general tip: Don't rush to fill your character set. You can save time down the road by putting off the building of glyphs which have identical or similar character parts as late as possible. At first, you may think a certain form is perfect and ready to start building related glyphs, but later you may well have a better idea. If you have replicated the form over many glyphs, it means lots of extra work. It's always a judgement call. I am always tempted to jump ahead to see how things are going to pan out, so I can relate.</div>

I have this problem, too. I prints a 90% or 95% gray instead of black. Some PDFs do this when I print, not just Chris's. It's a mystery to me. I have a PostScript clone printer--I suspect it has something to do with it, but it's only a guess.</div>

The problem came from the Preview software it's already installed on our operating system. For me it's Preview on Mac OSX. 

The downloaded file from  Internet, Typophile or other website is switch in a pixel file to be easy to open or to print with anykind of picture software.

The solution : launch Acrobat and print the file, you will get a 100 % black.

		<div class="commentbody">Chris,

This looks very nice, very nice. I wouldn't mind a repetitive address like 333 if it looked that good. 

I would not make a big issue of 90-degree stroke endings. Ask yourself if that is an appropriate thing for this design. Right now, I think it's more appropriate for the caps than for the lowercase. There's no reason the endings have to be exactly perpendicuar to the stroke, either. Cheating them slightly may help you down the road (like when you're drawing the bold). Mark has a good point; whatever way you treat them, make it consistent throughout the font (caps as well). See Kabel, Stone Sans, Syntax, Myriad, and Stellar. IMO, the terminal angle works for some of those and not for others. Also note how Syntax terminals change with added weight. 

I don't really see the need for the bent tops of i and j either. Since the caps (what I think of as the template) have an uncluttered, authoritative feel, I see this kind of detail as inappropriate and extraneous. How much extra stuff can you remove? Even the r can be more simple. Let go of feeling like it must have a lot of curve. I think the bent ear it has now detracts from its potential simplicity. Also consider losing the curve at the bottom of q and on the tail of y. are those features structural, or just noise? Alternatively, consider giving y a straighter, more subtly curved tail. 

Re: the feel of the caps: I finally realized what I think is not jelling between caps and lc: The caps seem majestic and timeless, the lc feels informal and friendly. Both are pleasing, but I think their styles are so different it makes for a confused stylistic voice. I really do enjoy the caps a lot, and would not mind a cap/small cap font, but if you are going to add a lowercase, I would hope it would have the same expansive, authoritative feel. The informal shape and narrowness of bowls (bdpqg) and the large x-height may be factors in this cuddly feel. I think the caps are the rarer, more intriguing thread to follow here, and you can always make a copy of your current working file to test out some different lc shapes (abeghnostu). 

To reiterate another of Mark's fine points: do not expand this out until all the basic design issues are resolved: Proportions, x-height, spacing, shapes of alphabetics, and the like. Do not get attached to single letters (g, r, i, f); they will hold the entire design back from developing. Some letters do give you more trouble, subtler problems. Sometimes you will wrestle with one single letter for months while all the others wait patiently. In the end, when you see the face in 18-inch alminum letters on the side of a building in London, it will all be worth the fuss. Keep up the good work!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Chris, just back and late to the party. This is your best so far, I think--but I have traditional tastes in type. The critiques you've gotten in this thread are really great also. 

I would only add to Carl's interesting observation about the lower case this: Lucas de Groot I think on his web site somewhere compares his Thesis, The Sans, to Frutiger, and comments how Frutiger looks old-fashioned compared to his. Well old fashioned but also more classic. The biggest difference I see is that the bowls of the pdpq are more circular in Frutiger and more modelled in The Sans. 

The element of informality in the lower case might be reduced, and the whole have a more classic feel if you did more round stems--closer to the o--on the bdpq. Also eliminating the bent stems would take you back in a more formal direction, but you might not want to go that far. At any rate, I think Carl is right that this direction is worth pursuing. Good luck. Killer Caps!  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, actually more accurate would be 'more circular bowls' on the lower case, which is what I was trying to say in my jet lagged fog. Or maybe at least more oval, and less assymetrical. 

Oh, I also see now rereading this thread that Nick Shinn already pointed out how Renner had unified his upper and lower case by keeping the curves of similar character. That is basically the same point I was trying to make.  

Also looking again at your alternates, to my eyes the combination of your two story a and one story g somehow work best in this face. </div>

Héctor,
I am in the process of preparing files for all 3 of my types (Leporello, Align, and Now) to send to some foundries to see if they have interest in selling them. If I do not get a positive response from anyone, I will sell them myself through MyFonts. Since no-one has heard of me, I assume my work will have a better distribution through an established foundry.

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, sorry I've not commented until now. The typeface is beautiful, and others have had very good critiques. Here's my 3 cents worth :-)

The f-ligatures don't look quite right to me. They seem somehow unbalanced. I think the f comes over a bit too far for fi, and the l seems to be leaning away from the f in fl. For the ff's, perhaps lengthen the arms? 

I hate to come back to the 3, but did you carry over the corrections you made to the main 3 to the superior and inferior 3? They still look somewhat skewed to me. </div>

Thanks for asking! You may or may not have seen the threads on the bold, italic, and hairline that I posted. I have to do the  italics for regular and bold before releasing. Trouble is, I keep getting ideas for other typefaces and have a bunch going at once. I am retiring from my day job in a month and should be able to devote some real time then.
