  body: Jean, do you have any other samples? Look at the first e and compare it to  the
    other e&#39;s its different and the ink is lighter on the thins than the thicks
    I bet a Calligraphy pen created this gem.

  body: If this indeed, is hand-written, perhaps someone might know of a font that
    is similar?

  body: I have to agree, seeing more text, that this is hand-drawn.  My suggestion
    would be to look through the samples in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script05Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">part 5 of the Script Font ID Guide</a> for something that seems
    similar in feel.  The Supplier codes in the linked Script Font Reference List
    can help you find who sells the fonts.
