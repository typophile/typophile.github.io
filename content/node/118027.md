  body: Thanks kthomps5! Close, but the descender of the "p" is much longer in Rama
    Gothic Condensed Heavy. The left stem of the "v" is also noticeably thicker. Maybe
    this is a typeface that was never digitized?

  body: "I agree with the never digitized idea. This from the heyday of photo-lettering
    when fonts were expanded, compressed and or clipped at will.\r\nKevin's suggestion
    of California Grotesk Black gives you a candidate to do the same with digital
    tools. Here is California Grotesk Black compressed so that the height width ratio
    matches your sample, done by compressing the width to 49%.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CaliforniaGroteskURWBlackInUseWidth49Percent_5667.jpg]\r\nBut,
    as you can see the compressed version is not nearly bold enough.\r\nYou need to
    start with a high contrast [aka thick and thin] grotesk that is a much heavier
    weight than California Grotesk Black.  Must be an ultra black somewhere that you
    could compress.\r\nDon"
