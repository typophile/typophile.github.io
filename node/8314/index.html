Smallcaps are rarely used. Even by people who know they're there, even in huge, expensive environmental signage projects, like the lettering aroung the fountain in Pasadena's &quot;Paseo Colorado&quot; mall. I mean, how much does it cost to make that decision, compared to just the damn water pump? But they don't use them, and that's that. Type design is one thing, typographic evangelism is another - attempt both at your own risk. <BR> <BR>So I'd rather see a designer spend his time on a new design. But if you must make smallcaps, at least please don't just thrown them in with the basic font - that's just wasteful. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I recall seeing some nice title pages done which included small cap italics.  As long as the italic capitals are not too flourished, smallcap italics make sense.  True, most users won't use them but those users are not the ones who buy lots of fonts (they stick with the free fonts that come with other software).  People with a great interest in typography do though and they are more likely to want smallcaps.  This then becomes a selling feature. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can't remember if I've ever used an italic smallcap: I suspect not. I use roman smallcaps a lot, so its not as if I wouldn't use the italics if I could think of a use for them. It should also be noted that italic all-caps are rare and generally frowned upon by typographic tradition, which explains why smallcap counterparts are as rare or rarer. <BR> <BR>The new MS ClearType fonts all contain smallcaps for all four styles (regular, bold, italic, bold italic), but MS have, um, special users, who complain if one style of a font doesn't behave in Powerpoint exactly the same way as the other styles.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, I would say that the <i>availability</i> of smallcaps is a selling point. But bundling a niche thing with a mainstream thing and selling them at one low price (because you couldn't sell enough of them at a high price) is just bad business. Whatever price you sell the main font at, you should sell an extra that people who care would buy for about the same amount, without having to raise the price of something with an extra that most people will never use. It's just sensitive tiering. <BR> <BR>&gt; italic all-caps are rare and generally frowned upon <BR> <BR>Doesn't that apply only to swashy ones? <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Doesn't that apply only to swashy ones? </i> <BR> <BR>Especially to swashy ones. Italic all-caps start showing up fairly commonly in title-pages in the 18th century, but seldom in any other context. I think typographers should generally ask themselves, when considering setting something in all-caps italics, whether there is any reason not to use roman all-caps instead. One can imagine, for instance, a title in all-caps that includes a non-naturalised foreign word; this might be a good reason to use all-cap italics. On the whole, though, I don't think there are many good reasons.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, I think we did use italic small caps (or did we fake them?) in <i>Language Culture Type</i>. In that job roman s.c. were used for the acronyms, like ATF, ITC, GSUB, AAT, ASCII, &amp;c., so in the titles with acronyms we used italic s.c. For example, <i>Typographica USSR</i>, <i>Calligraphia USA/USSR</i> (p. 45). And what about that edition of Gurdjieff's <i>Beelzebub's Tales</i>, remember? Have any italic s.c. been used there?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I prefer fuller families to leaner ones when it comes to type. Something like italic SC isn't a make-or-break, but it's reassuring to know I <i>could</i> use it. Some families have 'all your bases covered' and I like that. <BR> <BR>Usually, I am careful to pick a font that doesn't lack feature I'll need (when I'm freelancing). But, there are definitely times when I've avoided a font based on what it <i>doesn't</i> have, particularly for larger projects that'll span materials I can't foresee. <BR> <BR>That being said, I haven't needed italic SC yet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although Italic Small Caps were made in only a few isolated case by Merganthaler Linotype and Lanston Monotype, they do have a certain amount of historic legitimacy. <BR> <BR>I can't think of too many instances where I would use them myself, but i have made it a habit to add them to all of the text fonts that I have designed and produced for my own small font collection. <BR> <BR>They do no harm, and I think it's better that they are available rather than have designers &quot;make&quot; them up for a specific piece of typesetting.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm reading Peter Burnhill's <em>Type spaces: in-house norms in the typography of Aldus Manutius</em>. It is an interesting study of the typographic work based on a few of the earliest of the Aldine books. The primary examples are those books showing the typographic treatment of a small roman cap with italic lowercase are predominant. <BR> <BR>I'm finding this a difficult read but from what I can tell Burnhill is assuming the treatment is a single typeface design. <BR> <BR>From my work on an extensive book detailing the UCLA collection, <em>The Aldine Press</em>, on which Nicolas Barker and Matthew Carter were collaborators, it is my understanding that the small x-height cap font and the italic font are two different typefaces, and were combined, partly because there was precedent (similar treatments can be found in earlier manuscript books), but mainly out of expediency, the matching italic caps had not been cast. I recall Barker correcting one of the bibliographers in this regard. <BR> <BR>While I do not know of any Aldine treatments of italic small caps or all italic cap settings (just to stay on topic!), I was wondering if anyone had further information on this, as it seems some of the weight of Burnhill's argument may be based on an erroneous assumption. <BR> <BR>Though I do like his speculation that size names for typefaces may have sprung from the Aldine attempt at standardization. <BR> <BR>Gerald Lange</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't recall this aspect of Burnhill's book. I thought he mentioned someplace that the roman caps originated in a different face, but were (cast on the same body as the italic. I'm not sure how much of his argument would hang on this question, anyway.</div>
