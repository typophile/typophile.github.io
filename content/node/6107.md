  body: Kyle, I think Oster was a pre digital era logo. It very well could be based
    on a font but don&#39;t be supprised if it was hand drawn

  body: I think Dan is quite right about the logo being pre-digital. The serifs on
    the &#39;s&#39; look very unusual and exaggerated; the &#39;t&#39; looks like
    a slanted version of Modern No. 20 or  ITC Modern No. 216, but not the italic
    from those; The &#39;e&#39; looks like an italic e from almost any font; and the
    &#39;r&#39; looks like a custom letter &#40;or at least nothing from the Modern
    family&#41;, since it has no foot serif, and a chopped off terminal on the arm
    of the &#39;r&#39;. Of course, the star in the O is added. <BR> <BR>In other words,
    you could probably re-create it only with some significant editing, or custom
    drawing.
