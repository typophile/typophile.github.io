<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi everybody,
Once i heard about Gerard Unger´s Chair and it´s comfort to spend hours in design development.
I don´t know if it´s a common matter of discuss but i think it is. Do you think the same?
I like one chair in particular, well 2: The Egg and the Swan (Arne Jacobsen) but i can´t afford them since they are very expensive (us$5.000 and up). They look both comfortable and with style. I dont know much about chair design but maybe there are a way to build them cheaper. I ask to a locar industrial designer here and he told me that those chair patents where finished..that´s pretty interesting if i find a model as a guide to build.
Maybe some of you love comfortable modernist furniture too but the price its always unable to afford. On internet i only fond this sold out book: http://www.digmodern.com/go/book/4079
Anyone know where i can find something more?

<div class=commentbody>I used to spend a lot of my time in an imitation <a href=http://www.designaddict.com/design_index/index.cfm/fuseaction/designer_show_one/designer_id/63/index.cfm>Eames</a> lounge with my PowerBook in lap. Currently I'm on my new <a href=http://www.eq3.com/cat-eq3/30028-06.html>Crush Chaise</a> built by EQ3, with the PowerBook on their handy adjustable <a href=http://www.eq3.com/cat-eq3/3020-032.html>Boomerang table</a>. I can work this way for hours. Comfy alternative to a desk.
Related: I've started a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/groups/mid-century/>Mid-Century Modern group</a> on Flickr and it's growing nicely. I try to post interesting deals I find on craigslist and eBay, but I guess that's not very useful to you down in Chile. Hmm.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm hooked on the <a href=http://www.hermanmiller.com/CDA/SSA/Product/0,1592,a10-c440-p8,00.html>Herman Miller Aeron chair</a>. Adobe is kind enough to supply these for all employees, and they are truly wonderful.
I have occasional lower back problems from an accident many years ago. Not only have I had far fewer back problems since I started using the Aeron (despite having gained weight during that time), I also find that when I am having back discomfort, sitting in the Aeron is the best thing I can do - even better than lying down. A couple of years after I started at Adobe I had a recurrence of back trouble, so I went out and bought one for home as well. Since then my back has been almost trouble-free.
Aerons are expensive (I see them at $400-500 used, $550-800 new), but if you can scrounge the money, they're worth every penny. They have a 12-year warranty as well.
Regards,
T</div>

<div class=commentbody>I sit on a Eames chair, made by Vitra. Polished aluminum, black leather, coasters. Expensive, I know... but I lucked out a few years ago when Vitra opened it's new show room in my country and they had a 2-for-1 sale for one day...
But I digress: on last years visit to New York I discovered a shop where they sold "replica's" that were a lot cheaper. The owner of the shop explained to me that he used the "Seven Changes Method" eg his replica's (he did a lot of those classics...) differ in at least 7 details from the original and thereby don't impede on existing copyrights and patents (so he said, please don't shoot the messenger).
A nice replica could be your solution...</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>An interesting book for those interested in thinking through this question with more than anecdotal evidence from friends and colleagues (though that info is pretty important) is Galen Cranz's <em>The Chair: Rethinking Culture, Body, and Design</em> (Norton, 1998/paper, 2000).
Cranz makes a point of showing the utter uselessness and even harmfulness of many of the "designed" chairs (think Bauhaus, Eames, etc.), and the bad consequences of designing general office furniture for uses other than allowing us to assume a healthy posture while we do stationary work. Almost invariably the furniture in an office reflects and reinforces our (in America, anyway) nearly Puritan prejudices about what it means to be and look "at work." (Hmm . . . it seems I've heard many on this site make many similar comments about typefaces that reflect concerns about idealized or preconceived notions of beauty, balance and symmetry, contrast, and so on, rather than legibility and readability. Rotis, anyone?) One irony I remember from the book: the typical "executive" chair is more poorly designed than the typical "task" or secretarial chair.
Cranz also discusses how what is "comfortable" for many, perhaps most people seems instead to be what we <em>imagine</em> to be comfortable, what we "know" to be comfortable prior to or regardless of our experience (cushiness, low back supports, curved spaces for buttocks, and so on). It turns out a lot of that is mythology (though different people have different bodies, and there are exceptions to practically everything you can say about ergonomics and healthy bodies).
For what it's worth--and not to naysay those who have testified on behalf of Hermann Miller here--Cranz thinks the Aeron is about as good as it gets for a chair of its type, but it still perches the sitter with her legs and torso at 90 degrees. About 135 degrees is a better position, she echoes physiognomists in concluding, and when the torso is upright with the legs at that angle, the muscles at the front and back of the abdomen can work together to hold the sitter up. (Of course, you also need a high and inclined work surface before you, too, so as not to have to pull your head and shoulders down to your work. I have yet to figure out how to combine that with a computer.)
Again for what it's worth, she has many good things to say about Peter Opsvik's designs, most notably the balans Variable--the original with the rocking base, not the cheap flat-bottomed knockoffs. (You can see and lust after the whole dearly-priced Opsvik ouevre at Opsvik's website, http://www.opsvik.no/index.asp?page=home&ver=6.) My partner (a yoga teacher) and I are in the process of testing her ideas; I've just managed to pick up a pair of Variables (thank you, eBay!) for about 2/3rds of their normal $320 (each) price tags.
Fair warning: Cranz drifts into some well-meaning but treacly utopianism about the ideal office towards the end of the book. Still, you can breeze through that stuff pretty easily. It's well worth a look for people thinking about how to set up their offices and homes for better health. I know I was sold on many of her ideas--or, at least, many of her complaints resonated in my own experience, and the one thing that I (a political theorist) have in common with the designers, typographers and typesetters, and software engineers on this forum (besides a love of type) is that I spend a lot of my professional life on a chair at a desk.</div>

<div class=commentbody>That's really interesting, Mojo. Thanks for sharing all that.
WRT the Aeron, they come in three sizes (A, B and C) and are massively adjustable. So I don't see why one wouldn't be good for a short person. I'm right on the edge size-wise, so I am comfy in both the B and C models, I've found.

<div class=commentbody>I've been through a number of chairs and have found either the Aeron or "none" to be the best. In essence, if I must sit*, HM makes the best chairs. You can spend $1,000(s) on these, or you can find a place that's liquidating a failed Co. and get 'em for $400-$500, which is still 2x cost, but a good deal because they last 10-20 times longer than most Companies that spend $50,000 on start-up seats.
*As for standing, I used to split my time between modes to avoid becoming numb and because it's pretty near perfect to kern in the dancing position. Now, I'm looking forward to doing so again, and adding surfing and stuff like this (writing) from the full lounging position. This'll be complete whenever Apple's latest endangered great cat/OS is font man friendly, all again possible because the once-tossed (what do you s'pose  w e r e thin king!?) ¡ jumbo cursor is back ! :)

The sale for me wasn't necessarily because it felt so nice but because after long hours in the thing, I could get up from it feeling fine. Mind you, this chair only works with an appropriate desk and monitor at a reasonable level to save the neck . . .

<div class=commentbody>When I hurt my back, I asked my neighbor the occupational therapist
for advice on my chair and computer set-up. She gave me some pages
that were very helpful, and my back hasn't hurt since. She said that
the main thing is for the chair to be adjustable, and then to adjust
it right.
If I remember rightly here are some points: The back should lean back
slightly - past 90 degrees between your upper leg and torso; your
upper leg should be parallel to the ground or slightly elevated (I
don't remember which) and feet should be forward of your knees and
rest on the ground or on an angled foot rest. Your upper arms should
be forward from your body. Forearm should be parallel with the

resting on the keyboard.
I want to get one of those fancy Aeron things, but with all of the
correct adjustments my standard issue Office Depot inexpensive chair
is quite comfortable and no back problems from sitting in it. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Don't get me started on Memory Foam Mattresses.
Long story short; sleeping on uncomfortable hard mattress, thinks - ah, memory foam mattress, that looks really comfy, buy said comfy mattress for £640. Bliss at first, 2 weeks later - agony, like sleeping on a hammock. Solution - buy mattress topper from IKEA for £75 and put on hard initial mattress. Nice.
Don't let that put you off - Super King Luxury Support memory foam mattress for sale - near mint condition - £250 anybody?

<div class=commentbody>I once worked in an office that had <a href="http://www.dwr.com/product/life-chair.do?keyword=life&sortby=ourPicks">Knoll Life chairs</a>. They are absolutely amazing. Infinitely more comfortable than Aerons. Unfortunately I cannot afford one, so I use a $99 chair from K-Mart.
Eventually I plan to replace my desk and drawing table with a massive Alvin worktable and just sit in a tall draftsman’s chair. I love those things.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Astronauts sleeping in zero-gravity naturally recline at about a 30 degree angle, leading some researchers to conclude that this is the best position for the human body at rest. I'm thinking about completely re-designing my work space around this concept. Get rid of the desk. Replace the chair with a kind of divan, curved to support the body comfortably in a reclined position. Have my keyboard and pointing device on a swivelling platform above my lap. Have my monitor suspended from the ceiling at an appropriate height and angle to look at from the reclined position.
Of course, this might just lead to falling asleep a lot.</div>

<div class=commentbody>[[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/sitting/sitting_position.html|Here's a link]] from the Canadian government that basically gives the same guidelines I passed along above, which I got from an occupational therapist.
My neighbor actually recommended not vertical, but leaning back somewhat.
I found I could use the same cheap chair, properly adjusted. Of course it would be nice to have a fancier one, but for avoiding aches and pains, I think that advice on how to set up your chair, key board and screen is really the key thing.

Then again, in the zero-gravity position I'd probably just fall asleep.</div>
