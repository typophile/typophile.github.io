  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Last year I taught a one-semester course in type design at Humber College in Toronto, as part of the Graphic Design Advanced Diploma (GDA 3-year). Four hours a week in class, plus homework.</p>
<p>The project I gave students was to make a TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) font.</p>
<p>Background: In the 1950s, Toronto built a subway system, with comprehensively modernist architecture. As part of the program, a geometric, all-cap typeface was designed (anonymously), for use in signage.</p>
<p>The course began with digitizing the original drawings, to introduce the technicalities of font production in FontLab, and then proceeded with students producing their own designs for a matching lower case.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are the results.</p>

<p>No. The Humber philosophy is that doing type design is a useful part of a design education, providing a unique insight into typography.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised to hear, though, that the face is often mistaken for Gill Sans, although perhaps some of the letters resemble it. Without knowing what it was, I would have mistaken it for another typeface, but it would have been Kabel or Bernhard Gothic - or something like that.</p>

<p>They were instructed to digitize the upper case exactly, then design a matching lower case that adopted the same formal vocabulary as the capitals. Despite such strict constraints, there was still plenty of room for interpretation, for instance in the the choice of x-height. I think they did a pretty good job of keeping things &ldquo;geometric&rdquo;, with the exception of one who just had to have a grotesque &ldquo;a&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So in this respect, it&rsquo;s a similar idea to Gotham, with &ldquo;given&rdquo; capitals and a lower case up for grabs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Joe, this is not some long-lost typeface you&rsquo;ve rescued from oblivion.
It doesn&rsquo;t need research and a &ldquo;definitive article&rdquo; to have its worth attested &ndash; it&rsquo;s a very obvious part of Toronto&rsquo;s graphic heritage, one that any Toronto resident remotely interested in typography can&rsquo;t help but be aware of and impressed by.
Designers often notice these things, you know, without prompting by writers!</p>
<p>I have a great deal of respect for your advocacy in trying to preserve the integrity of the TTC design, and like you am appalled by the piecemeal liberties that have been taken to &ldquo;update&rdquo; the design of parts of the transit system.</p>
<p>However, whether the type system is corrupted or not, a large amount of the original signage remains, and this is typographically relevant and a suitable subject for a type design project, with or without your contribution. Making &ldquo;found&rdquo; lettering into typefaces is a commonplace for type designers. For instance, I was greatly inspired by the old lettering on the downtown Toronto post office (now the Air Canada Centre), in the design of Fontesque. I have considered publishing a version of the TTC typeface in the past, for example, as something for the goody bag at Typecon 2002. And there is Gotham, which I also didn&rsquo;t mention in my original post, but which was quite instrumental in shaping my ideas for this project: font with lower case to match cap industrial signage.</p>
<p>Jonathan Hoefler&rsquo;s notes on his revival of the Fell types, when he showed that there are several ways to interpret a revival, and Oz Cooper&rsquo;s demonstration of different ways to overdo the revival of an Incunabula face, have both reinforced my interest in the multiplicity of possible revivals/interpretations.</p>
<p>I was also looking to move away from the type design courses I have taught in the past, where the emphasis I felt had been too much on individual expression. So you see, there are many reasons I came up with this project, none of which have anything to do with a certain pundit.</p>
<p>Certainly, you are responsible for publishing the original drawings online, but I didn&rsquo;t actually tell my students those drawings existed, and I had never seen them. I had wondered whether any of them would work from the signage directly (rubbings, drawings, or photos), or go to the TTC offices and find source material, but thanks to the Internet and Google, they discovered the scans of the original drawings online, and so they all took the straightforward route and worked from those. I didn&rsquo;t have a problem with that, although I would have been extremely impressed if someone had worked more immediately from the image in the wall tiles, trying to capture some of the quality of that medium.</p>
