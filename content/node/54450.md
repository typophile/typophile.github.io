  body: "Remove the color to get a more objective critique. Because right now, the
    red and aqua is suggesting a very early - mid nineties color scheme. Also, try
    to improve the quality of the png you made, as it's distracting to see the low-resolution
    compression boogers on angled lines \u2014 such as the right side of the camera
    logo, the \"v\", the \"y\" and all of the characters in \"creative\".\r\n\r\nI
    can tell you now though that the \"creative\" bit is going to be lost at small
    sizes. (Especially since it's almost lost at this size!). Choose a less condensed
    font for it.\r\n\r\npenn"

    \ Are there any resources for creative, artistic, faSHION-oriented (not commercial,
    rigid or sterile) designs?\r\nNew to this site... Thanks!"

  body: "Well I've made one myself--I spent a lot of time just googling photography
    logos and business cards for inspiration. That might help you see the gamut and
    know about where you're wanting yours to stand--modern, high fashion; ornate,
    high fashion; natural but contemplative and somber; natural but intense and lively;
    etc. \r\n\r\nThat's your first starting point--position the business by gauging
    it against all the types of photography out there.\r\n\r\nMy process came from
    knowledge of what this photographer liked to shoot best (even if it wasn't what
    she would shoot all the time)--which was nature macros. Hopefully it's helpful
    to you that you have intimate knowledge of your wife's style.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/57106\r\n\r\nIn
