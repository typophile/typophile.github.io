  body: "Chris is right: it\u2019s Gotham Light.\r\n\r\nGo [[http://www.typography.com/testDriver/index.php?productLineID=100008|here]],
    select Gotham Light and past this text \u201CIt\u2019s not your dream phone\u201D
    in the field. In brief, you have to use the correct apostrophe mark \u2019.\r\n\r\nWhat
    you see as a \u201Cserif of the Y\u201D is actually a kind of an optical illusion
    caused by the A/C vents (?) of the building."
