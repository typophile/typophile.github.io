  and the designing process of his typography Brush Script, created in 1942 for the
  American Type Founders (ATF).\r\n\r\nThe only relevant thing I have found is that
  he designed the mentioned font and another one calles Park Avenue. In the internet
  or in books, there is not much information about Brush Script besides stating it
  was a landmark for Script typographies along with Mistral. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n--\r\nCFCG"

  body: "A bit of info on Brush Script from [[http://books.google.com/books?id=BYjgAAAAMAAJ|American
    Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century]]:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>...designed in
    1942 by Robert E. Smith as one of ATF's group of contemporary scripts, intended
    to replace designs from the early part of the century. This one has a handlettered,
    freely-drawn appearance, with the letters joined skillfully so the connections
    are not obvious. The availability of the face on Monotype mats has given it a
    much greater range of popularity and usefulness. A heavier weight was projected
    but not completed.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOther ATF fonts in that group include Brody
    (Harold Broderson, 1953) and Repro Script (Jerry Mullen, 1953), the latter described
    as \"another of the foundry's attempts to replace its delicate old traditional
    scripts with contemporary faces.\"\r\n\r\n[[http://books.google.com/books?id=alglQxkHi-wC|American
    Type Design & Designers]] mentions that Smith worked with ATF from 1933 to 1942
    and was the art director of the New York World's Fair in 1939."
