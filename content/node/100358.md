  the institute. I would like to know what real designers think about it, and what
  do you generally understand from that logo.\r\nWhen I saw it the first time it looked
  to me a logo for a campaign against the INFN, with that \"NO INFN\" written on it.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/noname_3539.jpg]"

  body: "English speakers like me will read <em>INFO</em>, a common abbreviation for
    <em>information</em>. Italian speakers may read this differently. Nuclear physicists
    might see the little circle as a subatomic particle instead of the letter <strong>O</strong>.
    \r\n\r\nWhat strikes me most about this logo is how playful it is. Maybe they're
    trying to say, \"Hey, we're not just a bunch of science geeks. We like to have
    fun too!\" But if I'm going to trust people to handle radioactive materials, I'd
    like to think they take their jobs very, very seriously. "

    logo.\r\n\r\nThat long red rule makes me wonder if someone was just having fun
    with the letter's header. I've seen office staff in other organizations send out
    mail that violated their organization's design standards."

  body: "I took me a while to figure that the real meaning of that logo is \"INFN
    INFO,\" which is a new campaign of the INFN to popularize our work. (I think)\r\n\r\n<em>@JamesM</em>
    No, it is not the official logo of INFN, it is the logo of this campaign.\r\nTheir
    official logo is\r\n<img src=\"http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/4585/logosinfn.png\"
    />\r\nand, on a side note, this is the old logo\r\n<img src=\"http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/7029/infntr2.gif\"
    />\r\n<em>@hrant</em> Well my \"great\" was ironic, I really do not like that
    logo."
