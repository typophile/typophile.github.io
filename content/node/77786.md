    to find but it has been invaluable to me.\r\n\r\nThis is a good place to start
    in the meantime:\r\nhttp://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing I've found to be very helpful if you're having trouble drawing a particular
    glyph is to open up fonts that you think are successful and analyze the letters
    on a macro level. There are a lot of subtle touches that add up to a character
    working that you don't notice from a distance.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, the search
    feature of this forum works very well if you have a specific question.\r\n\r\nI
    also recommend a sketchbook with grid paper or a dot grid (at least to start).
    It'll help you keep your character widths under control until you get a better
    feel for it.\r\n"

    on amazon\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509\r\n\r\n\r\nOh,
    and about the grid notebook: I'm not saying you should always follow a strict
    grid structure when you design your type. Your eye is always better than rigid
    geometry (and when you get into it, you'll see that most \"geometric typefaces\"
    aren't as geometric as you thought). Certain characters (in order to be most successful)
    should break the grid. The notebook is just a tool that I've found to be useful
    for keeping track of measurements. It makes cap/x-height easier to keep track
    of so you spend less time drawing guide lines, and makes it easier to keep an
    even stroke weight."

    to designing logos and lettering. On top of which, it's completely hilarious and
    irreverent \u2014 maybe the only type book that's ever kept me up late at night,
    reading in bed and laughing."
