  away from us today: our capacity to concentrate.\r\n\r\nOmmwriter is a simple text
  processor that firmly believes in making writing a pleasure once again, vindicating
  the close relationship between writer and paper. The more intimate the relation,
  the smoother the flow of inspiration.</em>\r\n\r\nInteresting concept, presentation
  and execution. Really well designed website too, with cufon'ed Quicksand for headers
  :)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ommwriter.com/en"

    short. I do use the computer for longer pieces.\r\n\r\nIf I'm just trying to write,
    I don't want to think about anything else so I prefer a plain text editor that
    isn't going to correct my spelling and grammar or offer a lot of design choices.
    There are many out there.\r\n\r\npbc"

    get back to you in, oh, let's say half an hour.\r\n\r\nWriteroom is <em>very</em>
    nice, in that it reminds me of my younger days, staring at a monochromatic screen
    full of green monospace characters ... (mind trailing off here ... flashbacks
    of DOS ... can't ... write ... anymore ...)"

  body: "Uhhh, did they really put that \"meditation music\" into the app? <:-o\r\nFor
    my taste, this might still be too distracting for what should just be a text editor.
    And it's a bit too cute, but whatever floats your boat I guess.\r\n \r\nFWIW when
    I was writing a lot (like for my diploma thesis) I enjoyed Ulysses. Plain-text
    format, some nice productivity features (like an additional \"notes\" window for
    each document, which can even take images \u2013 very handy), AND a nice fullscreen
    mode with no distractions. Not even a winter landscape :)\r\n(Disclaimer: It's
    been a good couple of years & I haven't updated, so dunno how it is now.)"

    (>90%) so I guess they thought it important.\r\n\r\nIts entire featurelessness
    is kind of distracting for me -- I find myself scanning the corners of the screen
    for evil paperclips, just waiting to jump up with advice. I bet there is a good
    market for it, though."

  body: For writing novels, I'm all about Scrivener, though the type/layout features
    aren't as nice as I'd like. But I guess not all novelists are type nerds like
    me.
