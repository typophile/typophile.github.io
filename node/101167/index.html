  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Been seeing this around a lot for the last little bit, and while everyone I talk to recognizes the trend, no one I&rsquo;ve spoken to has any idea what to call it, and therefore searching for examples has been difficult. I&rsquo;m hoping to get some guidance if there is actually a name for it — I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> looking for snarky barbs in terms of appraisal of this trend.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve attached some images, but overall I&rsquo;d describe it as being a design approach with priority on type, characterized by unconventional grids, typically monochromatic or duotoned color selection, minimal use of photos/illustrations, frequent use of minimal geometric graphics, and frequently executed with fonts by The Entente, but also with Futura, Times. Ideologically it seems to be taking a naïve posture — and while there is a superficial lo-fi-ness to it, it&rsquo;s still pretty systematized/polished.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>A lot of the trendier layouts come from text-on-a-path and then instead of column grid layouts as in your 2nd example, these paths are then overlayed or isolated as typographic shapes themselves.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is my first exposure to this style <em>per se</em>. My first reaction is that it embodies many of the principles of Bauhaus/Swiss/modernist design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typography as the principal visual element</li>
<li>Preference for simple sans-serif types, minimal use of large type sizes, and use of a single font throughout.</li>
<li>Grid as the definer of the space.</li>
<li>White (or flat color) space as an important compositional element.</li>
<li>Avoidance of decorative elements other than simple geometric shapes.</li>
<li>Emphasizing the two-dimensionality of the page space.</li>
</ul>
<p>I see some influence of the backlash against modernism that cropped up in the 1980s (a style I used to call sub-modernism):</p>
<ul>
<li>Offbeat use of color.</li>
<li>Non-traditional use of letterspacing.</li>
<li>Intentional violations of the grid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your examples are different from mid-20th-Century modernism in that they have more sense of style, and even a hint of playfulness.</p>
<p>The modernist aesthetic was partly a matter of acknowledging, and even celebrating, the industrial processes that produced office buildings and books. Type on a grid with little color or decoration was optimal for letterpress printing. The examples here are riffing on that look, but they also have some fun with the freedom that digital production gives them to superimpose type on photos, etc.</p>
<p>If I had to name it, I&rsquo;d pick something like Digital Modernism. Or maybe I&rsquo;d refer to the Bauhaus influence, and call it Adobe-haus.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Victor To your point about the sense of playfulness, I&rsquo;ve been referring to it in my head as &ldquo;deadpan design&rdquo; as it seems to have similar DNA to what Wes Anderson has done in his films' type treatments: there&rsquo;s a straight-faced reference to this sort of vintage avant garde/high brow treatment, but it&rsquo;s done with a wink.</p>
<p>@Neil That&rsquo;s partly why I finally wanted to get this sorted out — this trend (or trends with similar hallmarks) keep cropping up, and I think it&rsquo;s becoming more of a movement than just a treatment. I feel like it&rsquo;s wrapped up in this zeitgeist of transparency and sincerity: they&rsquo;re &ldquo;designing down&rdquo; or at least using a short-hand for a naïve design approach to communicate honesty/earnestness/every-man-ness. It seems like there&rsquo;s the <i>business as usual</i> reaction against polished establishment &amp; corporate design, but I think what&rsquo;s interesting to me is that there&rsquo;s almost an element of a reaction against irony, as well.</p>
<p>@hrant I suppose the answer to that largely depends on what your goals are ;)</p>

The result isn&rsquo;t always &ldquo;good design&rdquo; in the conventional sense (for example the one with text overlaying a rather busy photo background), but it would be a boring world if everyone followed the same design rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the freedom that digital production gives 
them to superimpose type on photos, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. Years ago I was in a large print shop when a job came in with type overlaying photos and color blocks in complex ways, and I overheard an employee say &ldquo;this job is a stripper&rsquo;s nightmare!&rdquo;  (&ldquo;Stripper&rdquo; being the guy who prepared the printing films.) And maybe it was with the technology back then. But these days with digital production, those things are much easier.</p>

<p>I do too. And what is even better is that it has gained traction on all levels of society including gallery pieces.</p>
<blockquote>I feel like it's wrapped up in this zeitgeist of transparency and sincerity: they're "designing down" or at least using a short-hand for a naïve design approach to communicate honesty/earnestness/every-man-ness. </blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that, but it&rsquo;s in interesting take on it. For me it just comes with the proliferation of design software.</p>
<blockquote>It seems like there's the business as usual reaction against polished establishment & corporate design, but I think what's interesting to me is that there's almost an element of a reaction against irony, as well. </blockquote> 
<p>I remember this graphic style gaining attention during the first Cut &amp; Paste comp. Competitions like that were a breading ground for graphic layout of quick fun in quick time. And as things evolved a fresh design software graphic signature/style began to emerge &hellip;seen in band fliers and on underground zines etc..</p>
<p>What I find refreshing is a Mix Don&rsquo;t Match approach to communicating a visual message, that and the fresh approach dealing with the surface of the page itself. The good stuff has completely shrugged off the shackles of page boarder slavery &hellip; and instead has layouts which deal in visual depth (ranging richness to thinness) without the use of traditional point perspective(s). But unfortunately the bad stuff is seen around more often partly because it is readily understood/copied I guess.</p>
<p>But the overall rule is the same for all eras of graphic design &hellip; that being one of a hierarchy of visual communication. So in that regard, the song remains the same.</p>

<p>I disagree tho about this Digital Moderism style of graphic communication as being one of god&rsquo;s gift to society. It is just as effective as your dusty graphic traditions.</p>
<p>In fact, more so because it has captured the attention of a whole new generation! It is completely in sync with youthful modern society &hellip;cool and uncool alike!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The term digital modernism makes me think of the digital hardcore music scene. As a movement it had its place in the 90s and while it is something I am personally a fan of it does not really define everything the movement was about, that has stemmed from it and it is (arguably) not really a thing in its own right today. Whatever this is, it has its roots in a variety of movements from the last 100 years and seems more like a minor trend, revival or neo-movement within a variety of analogous areas of graphic design, music, fashion and art.</div>

Trends in general—and following trends in particular—are basically simply an abdication of individual responsibility.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Gosh, I thought used pretty plain language when I wrote: &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m hoping to get some guidance if there is actually a name for it — I&rsquo;m not looking for snarky barbs in terms of appraisal of this trend.</em>&rdquo; But thanks anyway for the <em>kids these days</em> handwringing and the snobbery.</p>
<p>As far as not &ldquo;seeing the trend&rdquo; — If you mean that from the examples given here, in this post, you don&rsquo;t see a consistent application of the exact same principles from piece to piece, fine, that&rsquo;s valid. But as I mentioned, not knowing what to call something makes it difficult to search for, and also to aggregate examples — so I&rsquo;m left with what I&rsquo;ve happened to bookmark that I recognize as being part of a larger trend.</p>
<p>If on the other hand, you mean that you are not seeing this trend in the wild, or more broadly, that you are simply not familiar with it, that is less a dismissal of the trend and more a dismissal from a meaningful place in <em>this</em> conversation, where I am explicitly looking for input from people who <em>are</em> familiar with it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Back to the conversation at hand — and I&rsquo;m definitely getting to a &ldquo;why bother&rdquo; place here, but just in case anyone was <em>actually</em> interested — I finally got my hands on Computer Arts' Typography Collection last night, and they&rsquo;ve got some interesting notes on these microtrends in their trend report from FranklinTill. I thought I&rsquo;d share some excerpts here from their appraisals, here:</p>
<p><strong>Microtrend: House of Fun</strong>
&ldquo;Bold statements have been given a witty, light-hearted twist&hellip; bad taste is being celebrated by designers who utilise free fonts, clip art and Letraset transfers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Design collective Zweizehn&rsquo;s&hellip; tongue in cheek approach gently mocks the showy celebrity world, whilst still trying to be a part of it. &lsquo;Trashy&rsquo; renderings and comic typography push the posters in a fun direction so they stand out from more obvious party flyers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Microtrend: Soft Modernity</strong>
&ldquo;[Last year] We tracked a theme through many of the design sectors the explored notions of simplicity and clarity. In a bid to stand out amidst the visual noise that surrounds us on a daily basis, an increasingly sober approach is being applied&hellip;. We have seen a return to minimalism&hellip; utilising unfettered sans-serif fonts and limited colour palettes. Over the last year, this minimalist and monochrome direction has softened to become slightly less sober and more feminine, whilst still retaining a bold and clean aesthetic. Fonts such as Aperçu&hellip; have gained much pupularity&hellip; Klim Type Foundry&rsquo;s Calibre has also been widely adopted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Using sans-serif typefaces in modular graphic grids, together with solid pastel tones create a new form of modernity&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Microtrend: Gothic Revival</strong>
&ldquo;Elsewhere, designers continue to update historical forms to make them feel newer and fresher. Lydian MT, the traditional gothic font designed by Warren Chappell in 1938, is a source of inspriation for many designers.&rdquo; Erik Johsson&rsquo;s font based t-shirt for the Violent Elegance series uses lydian bold, framed within a geometric grid.</p>
<p><strong>Macrotrend: The Real Thing</strong>
After these reports on these microtrends, they segue into a macrotrend they&rsquo;re calling <em>The Real Thing</em>, which they characterize as being defined by: Tradition Revived, The Magic of Making, Linking Past to Present, and Traditions Reborn. Here are some salient points,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen not only a return to traditional visual design references, but also the celebration of the craftspeople and producers themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;We explored how transparency in the production process was being used to communicate to consumers how products are made. The consumer&rsquo;s desire to learn how things are made shows no sign of waning, whilst also being a tool for brands to communicate the rich stories behind their products.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preservation of our cultural typographic surroundings is a major factor for those wanting to connect us to our past as well as future, but also to connect a community to its history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traditional typography techniques are seeing a revival. Methods such as letterpressing are being combined with modern aesthetic interpretations.  <em>Das Mainzer Grotesk Experiment</em> by design collective Zweizehn celebrated the experimental use of the letterpress rather than simply focusing on its retro charm. Zweizehn created and cast its own letterpress type and invited up-an-coming typographers Marcel Häusler, Alexander Lis, Daniel Weberruß and Malte Weinmann to create posters in response to the question &lsquo;More than Retro?'&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting to frame these layout patterns as a part of this &ldquo;Real Thing&rdquo; trend, and I definitely think there&rsquo;s a confirmation in what&rsquo;s been previously mentioned in this thread around the ideas of levity, reaction against corporate mass-production and its attendant polished styles, and a pivot on classic design clichés. Here&rsquo;s some more examples from groups that they call out in the collection:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I find this discussion extremely interesting. I feel like graphic design as a function in society is becoming more and more recognized (departing the »Oh, thats actually a job?«-sphere). Living and working in Berlin, it&rsquo;s ubiquitous — both this ›anti-design‹ and the awareness. I like the pastiches within pastiches, because I like the inherent post-modern idea to take existing codes and rearranging/intertwining them. It can be very exciting, and there can be great results from people approaching a design with less inhibition concerning rules and proper usage. I kind of see it as graphic designs’ equivalent to Jaimie Warrens’ photography in a way if that makes sense&hellip;</p>
<p>As a job, graphic design is a craft to me. Me and some colleagues refer to this style as ›hortig‹, meaning HORT, a Berlin-based agency that constantly rides the edge of ugliness and genius or just pleasing. And I have done that myself I guess. But this ›anti-design‹ can also be nothing more than just a quick fix. If applied properly though, with context and function or the deliberate disregard for both, I would definitely consider it a style that is itself composed of anachronistic elements. Movement might be a bit much though.</p>
<p>Anyways, my two cents. Exciting.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Frode: I agree that these microtrends have a brief half-life, and I don&rsquo;t see these small patterns as underpinning a movement per se. I think the emotional response they seem to born out of, however, is building into something of a movement. It&rsquo;s a nice exercise to attempt to identify a movement in its infancy, but you are absolutely right: we can only really look at it in hindsight, so time will tell.</p>
<p>All I was trying to do here is figure out some nomenclature so I could track down more examples of it. I&rsquo;m trying to give my layout students a better look at trends in type and the design world <i>as they happen</i>, and train them to look for these trends, and get at deeper cause as to why a trend gains traction and usage.</p>

Also, you don&rsquo;t have to like something to think it&rsquo;s worthy of analysis; I myself dislike all the &ldquo;anti-design&rdquo; examples I&rsquo;ve ever seen* (even though I dislike Modernism as well) but I try to pay attention because that&rsquo;s a designer&rsquo;s responsibility. However I think it&rsquo;s good to remind people that just because something is trendy doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s Good or that it will have deep cultural impact.</p>

I love a good back and forth in a discussion, and I am thrilled to interact with people who are fundamentally at odds with me in terms of taste, preference, and style. You are absolutely right: these people are often your best teachers.</p>
<p>But when your first response to a specific question in a forum  is &ldquo;What&rsquo;s worse acting dumb or being dumb?&rdquo; it amounts to little more than interrupting and pulling focus. Where <i>exactly</i> is the conversation supposed to go after that?</p>
<p>So yes, let&rsquo;s have a discussion about what defines this trend, let&rsquo;s identify what qualities these pieces share, let&rsquo;s talk about what is at the core of the movement (which, hey, maybe &ldquo;acting dumb&rdquo; <em>is</em> a quality at its core) — but let&rsquo;s not derail things right off the bat with flippant remarks about ebola, whether being intelligent is cool, or what have you.</p>
<p>Am I crazy here?</p>
<p>If this was a real life discussion, and I&rsquo;d laid out a bunch of work from various people, and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to classify these pieces, is there a name out there for this style and I just don&rsquo;t know it? Or is this something new? These are what I could find, but these are some qualities I&rsquo;m talking about&hellip;&rdquo; and you strolled over after the discussion had begun with an arch &ldquo;What&rsquo;s worse acting dumb or being dumb?&rdquo; How exactly do you think that would be received?</p>
<p>Is or is it <em>not</em> a dick move to sit through this conversation of your own free will and then interject &ldquo;This is boring! I&rsquo;m amazed you people actually care about this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is or is it <em>not</em> a dick move to walk into a room where people are talking about trends and drop an icy &ldquo;I think all people who follow trends are abdicating their individual responsibility and refuse to think for themselves&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Are these the actions of people trying to have a conversation, or trying to put the brakes on the conversation? Do the rest of us get to just jump back in to what we were talking about, or do we have to actually stop and address and acknowledge what in any other situation would be patently rude behavior?</p>

In the context of type, anti-design could for example be to omit optical adjustments in search of a naïve style.

<p>And personally I think the application of these styles are poor when implemented without context or cause. It can be quite a quick fix, create a duplex-image and a 4-by-6-grid using Century Gothic with 120%-glyph-height and there you go. If the content of the design on the other hand transcends historical/political/etc classifications, ›anti-design‹ can be a fine choice — but regarding work ethic, I think it has to be a deliberate choice (even when playful – at least in hindsight) or it&rsquo;s just insulting pretty much.</p>

<p>One of my design professors used to use this example. Imagine 2 signs. One says &ldquo;First National Bank&rdquo; and is made of steel and marble. The other one is outside a farmhouse and says &ldquo;Fresh Eggs&rdquo; and is made from a piece of cardboard. It&rsquo;s hard to image 2 signs that are more different, but each is appropriate for its purpose and setting.</p>

<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s a big factor. And even though it might be harder to read in some cases, readability isn&rsquo;t the only factor in design. They are trying to appeal to their target audience.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading this thread.</p>
<p>I tend to agree with aluminum&rsquo;s observation that there are signs of David Carson / RayGun / BlahBlahBlah in there, also, perhaps, some of Neville Brody&rsquo;s later, more conventional/restrained work.</p>
<p>When I first started work as an apprentice comp. in the 1960s I worked for a small company that had been in business since the 1920s. One day I unearthed a box of old electros from the 1920s/30s that were created from either hand-drawn lettering or from repro proof paste-ups. Many of them were two-colour sets, wrapped with a proof. Type reversed out of a colour band or stripe or colour on colour was popular. There is something about the use of colour in these examples that reminds me of those electrotypes. The influence, I believe, came from a very watered down Art Deco; typefaces used were either Gill Sans variants or were geometric sans faces, both of which were popular amongst jobbing printers at that time.</p>
<p>One of the things that always frustrated my desires with my early, naive designs was the limitations of hot metal typesetting; anything beyond the horizontal and vertical was problematic. We had angle-quads which would, with considerable work, allow 45 degree angles—like the example in the CAB09.Spread 01.jpg example, but I was only very rarely allowed to use them as it took much longer to set and time was money. That example looks very like it could have been set in hot metal type and I wonder if the designer is mimicking this—either consciously or otherwise.</p>
<p>A couple of the page layout examples remind me of the layouts produced by Octavo in the 80s.</p>
<p>Conclusion? I&rsquo;m not sure but maybe there are a number of influences at work here. Perhaps it is, like the widespread use of typewriter faces in the early days of desk-top-publishing, some kind of back-to-basics—simplicity is never poverty; it is great virtue movement, if in fact it is a movement at all.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I have heard people calling this trend ‘post design’. The term suggests that contemporary applied art (which I will refer to as design here) should look like as if not being designed at all. As if designers now can leave all things that are thought of as ‘rules’ can be ‘left behind’. As if designers may now become something like artists. A strange attitude in a time where practically everyone that has access to a computer can ‘design’ something. Yes, I think that everyone can be an artist, but design is right between craftsmanship and art. Surely, we can debate wether artistic talent can be ‘taught’ at an art school at all, but in the case of craftsmanship, the idea that it may fall from the sky is nonsense. And, seeing this from a practical point of view, why would clients pay for something that is as illegible and user-unfriendly as anything else one can pick from the street? In Europe, partly due to the shift to the bachelor-master in design education, art theoreticians that are new to the applied arts have begun promoting the idea that by introducing art-theory into design education, and making it a major part in master sudy programs, applied art is now being upgraded into ‘art’ (or at least something very very close to it …). Which, imho, is humbug. When designers are going to behave as artists, they will soon be ending up as artists. Which is fine with me as long as they do not call their work ‘design’. I’m fine with design theory, but I think that the applied arts need their own focus in this field. There is still a lot to be researched when it comes to legibility, readability, usability, sustainability, etc. Also the history of writing, lettering, calligraphy, book design, graphic design is a field where research which even recognizes us designers as people that may eventually come up with suggestions on where research is needed and how our knowledge could be scientifically evaluated is rare.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think you&rsquo;re right that Design has been moving towards Art lately. To me that&rsquo;s a natural (but undesirable) result of the West&rsquo;s emphasis on individuality, where people think expressing one&rsquo;s self is a valid career choice, and designers are basically failed artists - people who would rather be painting things in their pajamas but they realize they have to pay for that nice car and cellphone plan <em>somehow</em> so they end up getting into design. The result isn&rsquo;t pretty (even though the results are pretty :-).</p>
<p>BTW I&rsquo;m starting to think that &ldquo;undesign&rdquo; is the best term here.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As I commented a week or two ago, &ldquo;All design . . .  has the purpose of adapting a client&rsquo;s (or author&rsquo;s) message to a medium and an audience . . . Poor design promotes the designer&rsquo;s message&ndash;or lack of one&ndash;at the expense of the client and the audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the past couple of centuries, Western industrial societies have come to think of <em>art</em> as where the artist&rsquo;s own message trumps all other considerations, and <em>design</em> as where the designer&rsquo;s imagination and skill serve as a vehicle for someone else&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>The border between <em>art</em> and <em>design</em> is permeable, as it should be, to allow good ideas to flow back and forth. But if we remove the border entirely, we risk encouraging designers to neglect our professional responsibility to authors, publishers, clients, readers, and viewers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Art and design have entirely different goals, but I agree that the border can be permeable.</p>
<p>One reason for some overlap is that that art and design share many tools and techniques. Also many designers started off as artists, but at some point (like in college) realized that design was a better fit for them.</p>

<p>I think folks in that category generally go into commercial illustration. It can pay well and it&rsquo;s closer to their sensibilities.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Speaking of art:
When I was in art school c.1970, conceptual art was the big thing. 
It’s now mainstream in gallery art.
Conceptualism makes the distinction between artists and makers, with making derogated.
Now conceptualism has spread further, to commercial design.
(I suppose you could say it was already there, as art direction is essentially conceptual—however, the end result has traditionally been documents with highly aesthetic qualities.)</p>
<p>An example I came across yesterday—Canada’s new photography stamps.
Whereas a stamp celebrating photography would have in the past (e.g. 2008 Karsh series, below) shown photos as aesthetic objects with nice compositions, now the idea holds sway.
<img src="/images/old-images/st_yousuf_4564.gif" alt="">
Yousuf Karsh was recently feted in Canadian stamps (above, 2008) so now a new series of photo stamps cleverly manages to include him—in a conceptual artwork by Arnaud Maggs. The photos in Maggs’ work are so small however—even after being “cropped” down to a dozen from 48—that all one notices (at real 100% size) are that they are black and white head and shoulders shots of a man in a hat. Could be anybody. The stamp as a whole has the plain squared-off serial lineup of many of Maggs’ gallery works—lab specimen/minimal/default/non/un- design.
<img src="/images/old-images/arnaud_maggs_yousuf_karsh_5362.jpg.size.xxlarge.letterbox.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The lack of design in the new series of photo stamps may be attributed to the fact that the selection of photos was created by a design manager working with curators. So all the images are hopelessly the wrong scale for stamps, unless one is a collector with a magnifying glass. But there’s a lot of supporting BS, which is a hallmark of conceptualism:

<p>Gestalten has a few decent books providing an overview of the direction editorial and graphic design is taking. The cheekily named, &ldquo;Regular Graphic Design Today&rdquo; is a nicely curated cross-section of what modern design looks like; a somewhat dada-ist, reductionist, type-centric approach to page composition with a healthy sense of humour. Another one in the series that I recommend is &ldquo;Turning Pages: Editorial Design for Print Media&rdquo;, which makes a case that we&rsquo;re in a golden age of print design because in order to succeed, mediocrity is no longer a business model that works.</p>
