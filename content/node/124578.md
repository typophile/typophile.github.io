  body: "Small sample, but Museo Slab 500 appears to be a good match:\r\nhttp://www.exljbris.com/museoslab.html\r\n\r\nSubstitutes
    include Archer by Hoefler & Co.and Neutraface Slab by House Industries (though
    it lacks the sloped sides on the |M|). Lubalin Graph is  another option, but its
    |M| also lacks the sloping sides and a short middle point.\r\n\r\nAmong Google
    web fonts, Roboto Slab and Bree Serif have a very similar look, though they aren\u2019t
    a match on all the details."
