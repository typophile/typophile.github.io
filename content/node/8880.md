  body: Looks like Bauer Bodoni to me, but there are <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=bauer+bodoni"
    target="_blank">other cuts</a> besides Bitstream&#39;s. What differences are you
    seeing that concern you most?

  body: 'They are very close, and I can substitute if I have to, but I&#39;d like
    to find the exact match if possible.   <BR> <BR>The italic is a little different
    in the logo, the serifs are longer, and it seems like the slope at the end of
    the ascending strokes is a little steeper &#40;although that could just be the
    way it was rasterized&#41;. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a visual comparison: <BR> <BR><img

    <BR>It looks like the EF version might be the one I&#39;m looking for &#40;it&#39;s
    hard to tell from the screen preview&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks.'

  body: I would say that the version you are looking for was digitized from a larger
    point size than the Bitstream version. FYI, metal type was cut differently for
    different sizes. Digital foundries don&#39;t necessarily digitize from the same
    original size, which might account for what you&#39;re seeing. It&#39;s also possible
    that the designer of this logo made some changes, such as moving the i dot down.
