    using the 1900 set for the small caps and 1910 for the caps. Coffee Bin's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/coffee-bin-fonts/letterhead/|Letterhead]]
    is based on similar source material. Check out their other offerings.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    in future use the Type ID forum for requests like this. You might have got some
    more suggestions."
