body: "Hello there, \r\nSo I am new around and I thought it would be quite a good
  idea of getting to start here by showing a tiny font project i'm on for few days
  (even if the idea is melting within me for a while). So I am new on the forum and
  on font-making ; I believed it would be an interesting way to get a better understanding
  of fonts thru designing it (and eventually make me a better designer... ahah...hum...).\r\n\r\nSo
  here is the firsts \"drafts\", I actually finished the small caps, but quite frankly
  not yet satisfied with the looks of some of them (and it does take me a damn long
  time for each letter). So here is it and feel free to give some opinions on that...\r\n\r\nMy
  idea was to create a serif font with a certain classic style but usable for designers
  and/or average people. Not quite there yet, but heh, have to start somewhere :)
