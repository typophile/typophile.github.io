  ties with the jewish community and his designs made for the jews, like the offenbacher
  haggadah.\r\n\r\nalso, for hebrew readers, i wrote an essay about koch's work in
  my hebrew blog:\r\nhttp://cafe.themarker.com/view.php?t=1455233"

  body: "The first edition of this book was a private project of the notary Dr. Guggenheim
    of Frankfurt a.M. For the German text a very early stage version of the later
    called \"Jessen Schrift\" was used. The Hebrew letters for text setting are from
    \ the Frankfurter Druckerei J. Kaufmann (no Klingspordesigns, a compromise). The
    Hebrew titles are made by Berthold Wolpe (woodcutter). Max Dorn does the book
    design. The musical notes are probably made by a son of Rudolf Koch, Paul Koch.
    The illustrations are made by Fritz Kredel (woodcut) and are hand colored. The
    book binding versions were done by Dorothea Freise. I think all persions belong
    to the Koch-Kreis. The price for the paper-bound version was 60 RM (a lot of money
    in 1928) and could be ordered directly from Dr. Guggenheim. \r\n\r\nThe known
    and popular second release from 1960 used a new layout with the typeface Palatino.\r\n\r\nThere
    are a loot of literature available of Rudolf Koch - I think, he is the most commented
    and documented type designer of Germany.\r\n\r\nIf you like to know more you have
    to read German books about him. Have a look to http://www.zvab.com/refineQuickSearch.do?anyWords=%22Rudolf+Koch%22+%2BKlingspor&lastXDays=-1&submit=Suchen\r\n

  body: "The relatively-recent English-language monograph <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rudolf-Koch-Letterer-Designer-Teacher/dp/1584560134/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1265893696&sr=8-7\">Rudolf
    Koch: Letter, Designer, Teacher</a> is quite OK, too. I certainly enjoyed reading
    it, and finally bought a copy a few months ago. On Amazon.com right now, you can
    get a copy for less than $20. The author translated a number of texts from German
    to English himself.\r\n\r\nOther excellent English-language sources are the Rudolf
    Koch chapter in <em>Letters of Credit,</em> as well as the two <em>Fleuron</em>
    articles that touch on his work\u2026 an article about Karl Klingspor, and another
    about Koch's work itself. Both <em>Fleuron</em> articles were written while he
    was still alive. But I doubt that either of them covers work like the Haggadah."
