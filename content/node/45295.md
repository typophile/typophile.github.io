  love a compelling brand story. And before I jump in, I need to confess my ties to
  the JetBlue brand, having once designed the logo, identity and airplane graphics
  (ahem, the livery design to use industry parlance) while I was at <a href=\"http://www.merkleyandpartners.com/\">Merkeley
  and Partners</a>.\r\n\r\nIn the original JetBlue style guide we listed Trade Gothic
  as the corporate typeface. After its initial run, and long after I was no longer
  involved with the brand it went through a seemingly endless stretch using Futura
  Bold and  yellow (what were you guys thinking?!). Now, JetBlue is back to DIN and
  orange and their characteristic jab at the airline industry that I would like to
  think put them on the map. And no, I wasn't involved in the refresh, but I feel
  like JetBlue is somehow an offspring of mine and I so I'm compelled to keep an eye
  on it. [More after the bump.]\r\n\r\nI'm typically not in favor of a corporate identity
  that uses a typeface for its logo and the same typeface for all of its materials.
  This detracts from a logotype. When the type system is not distinct the logo can
  disappear. But, I'm even less in favor of Futura <em>anything</em> and I also believe
  DIN works better for JetBlue than even Trade Gothic did. \r\n\r\nSo what's up now?
  When the rest of the airline industry is hunkering down, waiting for consolidation
  you have Virgin America making a splash and JetBlue trying to refresh their brand.
