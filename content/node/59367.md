  find the right font myself. I\xB4m hoping maybe some of you would be able to better.\r\n\r\nIt
  is an old logo text from the eighties. I\xB4m guessing some kind of century?\r\n\r\nHope

  body: heh. Maybe I'm blind, but it looks quite similar to me. The only little difference
    I see it in the notch of the C.

    me agree with Craig. It\u2019s rather bad."

    think it\xB4s any of those. The M has some very distinct curves on top, the C
    has that notch.\r\n\r\n@eliason: you mean it\xB4s been drawn for the logo?\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your suggestions\r\nCarsten"

  body: 'Yes. The sloppily asymmetrical curves of the serifs, the identical starting-point
    ellipse shape for ceo, the abrupt transitions from curves to straights, and other
    mistakes (see the right side of the serif of the middle leg of m) prove that this
    is very amateur work, which is more likely (certainly in the 80s) to mean an amateurish
    logo rather than an amateurish font. '
