You&#39;re not interested in functionality. <BR>Maybe he&#39;d be happier as an accountant? <BR> <BR>Sure, simply making fonts for the market, without an appreciation for Shape and/or without an understanding of reading is indeed very boring - it&#39;s like being a grocery bag boy &#40;and many of those fonts would indeed look smashing on grocery bags&#41;. I personally try to express the power of shapes, but am also very grateful for my innate curiosity of how things work deep down. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;ve had the pleasure of working with Dennis on custom type commissions during my ad agency days, and then during my tenure at Phil&#39;s Fonts, a distributor of his retail fonts. Dennis &#42;is&#42; a complete freak, but a wonderful, trippy guy with a great and twisted sense of humor... talk to him on the phone for 5 minutes, and you&#39;ll be in another world. His type treatments and logotypes for pubs are inspiring, and works of art in themselves; his layered typefaces are really fun to play with. <BR> <BR>My only complaint about Dennis&#39; work is his aversion to creating characters other than the basic alphanumerics for fonts that are to be sold commercially... I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s gotten past that, but it used to drive me nuts...</div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Aversion probably isn&#39;t the right word - I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s conscious or not, or simply the result of being too busy, or getting distracted by another project, etc. Anyone who&#39;s done 600 well-drawn typefaces is probably going to take shortcuts to remain so prolific. I know nothing about the character sets in Dennis&#39; Hebrew types - I only have experience with his Latin designs and revivals. <BR> <BR>Commercial types in particular should have a full character set with basic punctuation, currency, etc., whether Latin or non-Latin. This is merely my humble opinion as a typographer, a graphic designer, and as someone who works with type designers in getting fonts prepped for market. It&#39;s a bummer to find the perfect typeface for a project, only to discover that it&#39;s missing the question mark or &#34;curly quotes.&#34; </div>
