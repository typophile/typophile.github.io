  low vision, and comes in several flavors:  for printed matter, computer monitors,
  signage, etc. <BR> <BR>The designer is listed as Dr. John Gill, with help from Bitstream.
  A little more digging brought up the name Peter O&#39;Donnell &#40;Type Consultant&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>The site at <a href="http://www.tiresias.org/index.htm" target="_blank">http://www.tiresias.org/index.htm</a>
  has a bunch of interesting stuff. <BR> <BR>Jay Fraser'

  body: '... as in, does anyone know how they came up with that particular design?
    What were the influences, etc.? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m wading my way through the research
    that&#39;s posted on their site, but all I&#39;ve been able to understand is that
    Tiresias is more readable than Ariel or TNR. I&#39;d like to know why. <BR> <BR>Anyone?
    Thx. <BR> <BR>Jay'

  body: Tiresias was developed by Gill after finding the closed captioning font on
    his television difficult to read. There was an article about this in a Print Magazine
    from about a year ago. At that time there was no italic, not sure if that has
    changed.

  body: Joe Clark is quite critical of Tiresias, but I can&#39;t remember the details
    of his criticism.

  body: Joe&#39;s criticism &#40;at least the one in his Print piece&#41; was partly
    based on an admission by Gill himself &#40;during an interview&#41; that the whole
    process was a committee-decision type deal with deadline pressures and inadequate
    direction. <BR> <BR>To me that just means it could have been even better, since
    I think Tiresias is a useful design. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I am visually impaired and involved in design of products for the visually
    impaired. Am using Tiresias right now as my personal style sheet main font and
    it looks great. <BR>My question is what are the alternatives if any? Prior to
    using this as my default web font I was using Verdana, what else? <BR> <BR>

  body: I gave up trying to read the research; I never did find the &#34;why&#34;.
    If it was a committee-driven process, that kind of follows. <BR> <BR>But even
    if they published the minutes of the meetings, that&#39;d give a little more insight
    as to how they came up w/ the design.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try to find that Print
    article. Thx.
