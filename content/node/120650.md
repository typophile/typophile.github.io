body: I'm getting tired of many of my fonts being listed separately rather than compiled
  as typefaces. I'm wondering if there's any software or script out there which does
  this for you automatically. I don't want to have to open each font, change the font
  info and generate each font individually in order to clean up my font menu.

    from FontLab does it rather nicely."
