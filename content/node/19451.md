body: I've been using Safari since it came with my Mac and like it just fine, vast
  improvement over IE or Netscape both visually and in terms of speed and display
  of graphics. I notice on this forum that a lot of people use Firefox and wonder
  why. Are there any advantages to Firefox that should make me consider using it instead
  of Safari?

  body: "There are many philosophical reasons for using Firefox, but when it comes
    to a web browser, I'm not such an idealist. I've used Firefox and Safari extensively
    and will tell you that, especially on the Mac, Firefox isn't nearly as polished.
    IMHO, Safari feels like more of a professional product. I prefer Safari for type
    rendering, ColorSync, Bookmark syncing with iSync and the highly usable SnapBack
    feature. If you prefer the Mozilla/Gecko layout engine that Firefox uses, I recommend
    <a href=\"http://www.caminobrowser.org/\">Camino</a>, which is much more Mac-like
    and professional feeling than Firefox.\r\n\r\nSome practical reasons for using
    Firefox might include:\r\n1. Better compatibility with crumby banking websites
    and such.\r\n2. More extensible features with plugins. However, for every Firefox
    plugin that's well-written, there are at least ten that are poorly written.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not trying to start a war here \u2013 these are just my personal preferences."

    Firefox in a nicer outfit. I prefer Safari though, it works great for me.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Whoops!"

  body: I use Safari 2.0 on Tiger because it renders webpages and starts up a heck
    of a lot faster than Firefox. Back when I used a PC I was all about Firefox though.

  body: "I prefer Firefox simply because for *most* intents and purposes what I do
    on my PC corresponds to what I do on my Mac (shortcuts, menu positions, plug-ins
    etc). \r\n\r\nIt's convenient to be able to do things in a similar manner no matter
    which machine I am using or where I am, ie. work (PC & Mac), home (PC & Mac).
    Yup, there is every possibility that I will be using anywhere from four different
    machines in a day, so portability is key.\r\n\r\n-nic"

  body: "i agree with nic. i work with a mac, and at home i use a pc. the shortcuts
    are really nice (better than in safari), the extensions are very powerful (if
    you start using some, take those from the top-lists on mozilla.org, they are all
    good in terms of coding etc). also, i love the search-tab to which you can add
    every search engine (or even translation-websites, wikipedia and others), and
    you can easily access it with ctrl+k / apple+k.\r\n\r\nBUT on mac, i have heavy
    problems with typerendering in firefox, the text in form-boxes goes over the border,
    etc.. "

  body: Thanks. I'm Mac only and guess I'll stick w/Safari. I was just curious what
    y'all thought.

  body: "I use Firefox for some of the aformentioned reasons. My note is that I use
    \"Tab X\", which is a Firefox extension that puts the close-tab button on the
    tab. When moving from Safari to Firefox, I found it really weird that the close-tab
    button was not on the tab. The cross-platform compatability and the extensions
    are very important to me. \r\n\r\n"
