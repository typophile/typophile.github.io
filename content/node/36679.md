body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI would appreciate any ideas on how to use text wrap with a
  numbered list. I am working on a book with numbered lists, using a preset style
  sheet that uses tabs that align to the period on the numbered list (the numbers
  need to be aligned at the period). When I need to use text wrap for illustrations
  that sit halfway in and halfway out of the column, all the indents get weird. I
  found an old post on this forum that exactly describes what I need to do, although
  it doesn't say if there is a way to do it. Let me copy and paste a link to this
  old post below, posted by Pica Pusher Feb. 08, 2006: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/17478\r\n\"Obviously,
  the tab gives you more control over the amount of space between bullet and text.
  And at this point, you\u2019ve made the compositors\u2019 job very simple\u2014all
  they have to do is put a tab between the bullet and the text, and they don\u2019t
  have to worry about any finnicky hidden characters. Unfortunately, look what happens
  when some nutcase gets ahold of it and starts using text wrapping:\"\r\n\r\nApparently
  I am that nutcase that needs to use text wrapping! Any help would be greatly appreciated.
  FYI I am using CS2.\r\n"
