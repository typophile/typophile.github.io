  body: "It's almost identical to a script called 'Hemlock' that was one of the film
    type brush scripts (many are shown in the Solotype Catalog). I think it was digitized
    as 'Gideion' in the Expresiv Brush Script Collection. A German company called
    Typo Bach is listed as a supplier in the Script Types book I found the font in.
    The only difference I see is that the 'i' has no serif in Hemlock.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    in the olden days -- check the similarities with his <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=C.106275.0.2&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Summerville%27s&sampleSize=48">Benguiat

  body: "I went and hunted through the Photo-Lettering catalogs, and they call this
    Adpata Script. They don't always credit the designers, but Ed Benguiat was one
    of their lettering artists. Frank Bartuska was another whose scripts look very
    similar to Benguiat's. The 'Hemlock' name is, I suspect, a Solotype re-naming.
    since he seemed to group these scripts in alphabetic clusters, with H and J for
    brush script styles. I suppose Hemlock is as good an answer as any.\r\n\r\n -

  body: "Nice find Mike, I notice that one of their Softdisk fonts, called 'Hamster'
    also looks a lot like this one. Their partial samples don't let you really compare
    all the characters. I guess the point is that there are available digital versions
    of something at least very close to the posted sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
