    Joseph W. Phinney pop up, one of the principals of Dickinson Type Foundry &#40;later
    merged into ATF&#41;. Among other things, he was involved in the Centaur story.
    Any relation?'

  body: Yup, JW Phinney is a distant relative. Very distant, though--you have to go
    back to 1740 before you hit our common ancestor. <BR> <BR>I did a talk that was
    partly about him at ATypI in Vancouver last year, btw. I&#39;ve done a bunch of
    research on him, because I was curious to learn more about his work and life.
    Knowing about him helped stimulate my pre-existing interest in type design of
    the mid 1880s to early 1930s. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    to America, right? I remember you writing something about that on the TD list,
    about 3 years ago. At which point Bill Troop promptly lambasted your uncle Joe,
    right? <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Well, the son of a guy who came over on a boat &#40;with his mom, as well&#41;.
    The guy who came over had seven kids, and one of them changed -- or maybe &#34;solidified&#34;
    is a better word given the state of spelling at the time -- the spelling of his
    last name to use a &#34;Ph.&#34; <BR> <BR>The family came from Lenton, which was
    then a village just outside Nottingham. <BR> <BR>T
