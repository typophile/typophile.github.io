  one of them:   the serif height is 33 units (designed it with FOG). But  when I
  \ convert the file with FogLamp - one serif is 33 units, the other 34 units; generated
  the font as Type 1 - but the same problem.\r\n\r\nAny idea? Thank you"

  body: "David, sounds like some of your old Fog points (aka \"nodes\") were not on
    the grid exactly, and had crept up north of 33.5 ems. \r\n\r\nFontographer \"supported\"
    decimal places, whereas FontLab won't let you use them. Because PostScript doesn't
    support them either. You see, it turns out that Fontographer was bluffing the
    whole time! It \"flattened\" the points when you generated fonts with off-point
    points and handles. When you FogLamp the files, you are getting whole-point flattened
    nodes and BCPs. If you had generated the same file from Fog as a TTF or PST1 file,
    then opened it in FLab, you would get the same result."

    the points to integer coordinates. If you don't do it here, FOG will do it upon
    generating the font anyway. \r\n\r\nA."
