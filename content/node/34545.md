  body: Yeah, there's playfulness there, but I don't think it reads the way you intend.

  body: "Whatever you read the first letter (I read \"K\") the bigger problem here
    is that you DEFINITELY read the \"D\". It's the most visible of all three.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I also see a fish here. Or maybe even a WWII bomb... :)"

  body: I want to see a clearer hierarchy between the foreground and background (the
    p over the black shape). Now all I see is a bomb since Litera pointed it out.
    I agree about there being a D. The backwards K feels awkward to me. Maybe a slab
    serif so you don't get fishyness. Hmmmm...

    your design seems too open to multiple interpretations. Try again!"

  body: "Are you somehow military oriented? Just joking.\r\n\r\nThis one does in did
    look like a military epaulette... :) But maybe you do want it to look like that.
    COmpared to your first design it did loose the \"D problem\". But now it could
    quite easily be read CP instead of KP. Actually I think if you hand it over to
    people, majority witll first say CP...\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
