  have different names. \r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nLATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH TAIL\r\nLATIN
  SMALL LETTER N WITH RETROFLEX HOOK\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hooktail_4915.jpg]\r\n\r\nMy
  question is: is there any difference in their aspect, proportions or design that
  should be considered in a new typography design? Or they are really the same with
  another name? \r\n"

  body: "As far as I can tell, the proper name of the attachment is 'hook'. 'Tail'
    is a description, just like \"i-bar\", \"h with stroke\", \"turned h\", \"small
    capital R\", \"turned y\", and lots of others, rather than the mouthful \"ulveolar
    front labial trill\" they describe. Font creators are not that good in phonetics.\r\n\r\n(On
    the other hand, I suspect the guys at IPA sometimes just make up characters as
    they write. \"Anyone got dibs on a <em>mirrored</em> small capital upside down
    R? No? Okay, it's mine!\")"

  body: "You might be interested in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_conventions_of_the_International_Phonetic_Alphabet|this
    Wikipedia article on IPA naming conventions]].  The Unicode Consortium's name
    for a given character or feature doesn't always agree with the IPA's name.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"tail\" and \"hook\" are indeed the same thing (the feature that indicates retroflexion);
    you will probably need at least two versions, one for letters like \u0256 and
    \u0273 where the tail is an extension of a stem or leg, and another for \u0282
    and \u0290 where the tail is an appendage to a horizontal stroke.  If you need
    more fonts with IPA characters for reference, you could also look at Gentium,
    Charis SIL, Doulos SIL, and Andika Basic, all available from [[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&cat_id=FontDownloads|SIL]].\r\n\r\nNice
    to hear you're putting IPA characters in your font!"

    consonants in IPA.The old name of [[http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0256/index.htm|\u0256]]
    was \"LATIN SMALL LETTER D RETROFLEX HOOK\". I guess it was changed to \"tail\"
    to avoid confusion with [[http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0257/index.htm|\u0257]],
    \"LATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH HOOK\".\r\n\r\nETA: too slow :)"

  body: "I would add that this seems to be a dispute between descriptions based on
    <em>appearance</em> (hook) and on <em>function</em> (retroflex). If the possibility
    exists, I\u2019d always prefer a functional description, but I don\u2019t run
    the place, and there\u2019s a lot of history involved.\r\n\r\nI know we love our
    computers, but I would strongly advise buying a used copy of <cite><a href=\"http://www.librarything.com/work/133047\"

    brief descriptions of the history of certain character forms -- i.e., from which
    it was derived -- as well as alternative representations.\r\n\r\n(But it's been
    a while since I last saw it -- is it indeed that book?)"
