  body: "Have you seen this typeface used anywhere else? This could very well be custom
    designed for this illustration. The character shapes are very geometric and a
    little awkward after all.\r\n\r\nIt reminds me a bit of the work of <a href=\"http://www.atelierreneknip.nl/initiative/type-collection-08/\">Andr\xE9
    Knip</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jannohahn.nl/\">Janno Hahn</a> (which is far
    better BTW)."
