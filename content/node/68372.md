    first one with <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-nicolas-cochin/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D72%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DLA%2520ROUE%2520Premi%25C3%25A8re%2520Epoque%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D34?refby=mfde\">Nicolas

  body: "The lettering in the bottom slide is similar to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/flange-bq/|Flange]]
    from Berthold. Another similar font for that one is Bob Alonso's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/crescent/|Crescent]].
    His font \"That's Amore\" is a heavier version of the same design. With Crescent,
    the 'y' would be similar if you reversed the tail.\r\n\r\nOverall, for most letters,
    I think Flange would be a good approximation.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega "
