body: "1) throughout the book I'm leaving a word space between the en dash...e.g blablabla
  - blablabla...what happens if it comes at the end of a quotation mark? e.g 'blablablbla
  -' should i leave a space? 'blablabla - '\r\n\r\n2) the typeface i'm using is arnhem...for
  some reason the r & t , r & y, f & k collide...it doesn't really affect the legibility
  but it looks ugly to me...should I change it? would it be considered unprofessional
  if I left it? why would a great designer like Fred Smeijers leave it like that?
  \r\n\r\nThank you!"

    if you didn\u2019t add them, both words on either side of the dash and the dash
    itself would jump to the next line if you hit the hot zone. Since you want the
    close quote to stay with the en dash, don\u2019t add a space. Simple.\r\n\r\n2)
    Arnhem Pro has an /fk ligature, but that appears to be it; I guess you\u2019ll
    have to like the /r or lump it\u2026"

    you are using en dashes consistently throughout.\r\n\r\n\"I like en dashes \u2013
    they're really cool.\"\r\n\"But when a dash ends a quote \u2014\" it is always
    an em dash. Signifying interruption (which is the only reason I can imagine ending
    a quote with a dash) is the special job of the em dash."

    read that article, I didnt realise the comment section was so informative.\r\n\r\nhrant:
    it turns out Fred Smeijers did that on purpose, since i do believe he knows a
    lot more about the subject than I do, I'll keep as it is..although looking at
    some books by Hyphen Press that use Arnhem I see that they have added a little
    bit of space between the r and y so that they don't touch, u might need a magnifying
    glass to see it though\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There is no reason not to change the kerning to your taste. You can do this
    in the application program.\r\n\r\n(Aside: A good modification to standard EULAs
    might be to allow any change to the font data, for one's own use only, if that
    change could also be made in the applications program.  In the first place, there's
    just no way to tell from the printed piece  where the change was made. In the
    second place, if you're going to make the change in the applications program,
    you have to be careful to get all occurrences. In the third place, it's sometimes
    faster, hence cheaper, to make the change in the font.)\r\n\r\nHaving said that,
    for Arnhem Blond used as the text font in books, often set a bit larger than magazines
    and newspapers, I like about  1.5% to 2% condensation. You can do this in InDesign.
    The downside is this may affect the kerning & letterfit just a bit. You'll have
    to try & see how it works for you. Remember, the original design was for a newspaper.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the en-dash before a right quote, I'd think you would want a bit of space
    if you're spacing the dashes elsewhere. Nor would I change to a closed-up em dash
    just for this one case. However, you could use a kern, or a fixed space such as
    a thin, which might give the same or just slightly less optical space as the word
    space used with other characters. IIRC, InDesign won't break at a thinspace, but
    in any case, you can put a \"no break\" command around the character sequence
    globally. Note that the \"no break\" command is different than the nobreak space
    (U+00A0)\r\n\r\nArnhem is a very  nice text face. From the link, I guess someone
    found it \"too Dutch,\" but I think Smeijers, like Carter & Majoor, is one of
    \ the geniuses in type design. (<cite>Counterpunch</cite> is a wonderful book,
    too.) Sadly, even being a genius doesn't mean you always get the kerning right,
    or minimally, that there can't be alternate, acceptable views.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: These colliding pairs are funny, in the sense that they do appear (and some
    of them frequently) in Dutch. Well, a light cut can take some positive tracking,
    so why not give that a try?
