body: Hi there,  <BR> <BR>I am working on my next typeface, Nordic, and I have the
  Narrow Light ready. How would you suggest making the different weights? Do you do
  it manually in Freehand or Illustrator, or do you use Change Weights in FOG? <BR>And
  if you do it by hand, what do you think is the best way to do that? <BR> <BR>Thanx,
  <BR>Ren

  body: That&#39;s great stuff, thanx. Although I&#39;m a FOG user, I will try to
    work with FL. It feels to me like a very unpleasant program. I&#39;m a Freehand
    user so I&#39;m more comfortable with FOG. <BR> <BR>Thanx, <BR>Ren
