  Eduardo Berliner\r\n\r\nThis typeface finds a perfect balance between technical
  excellence, careful design of letter forms for extended reading, and a measured
  dose of charm and personality. Its informal feel allows for successfully typesetting
  a wide range of applications, from magazines and fiction books to advertising and
  websites.\r\nCalligraphy, be it done with the broad-edge pen, brush, or other tools,
  has been fundamental in the development of Pollen. Its influence is clearly visible
  in the construction of the top serifs contrasting the curved bottom serifs and the
  fluid aspect of terminals and tails, such as on \u201Cg\u201D and \u201Cr\u201D.
  The shapes of the diagonal letters are based on a less formal calligraphic model,
  but still uses the broad edge pen. \xADThe letters were then subject to a further
  process of pencil drawing and digital re-interpretation, which gave them the final
  shape.\r\nThe designs of \u201Ce\u201D and \u201Cc\u201D are derived from drawings
  made with only one continuous line, with the pencil always touching the paper. The
  letters \u201Cg\u201D and \u201Cy\u201D express the intention to bring informal
  elements to a typeface intended for long text reading, usually characteristic of
  casual writing, .\r\nPollen consists of 3 basic styles with an extended OpenType
  Pro character set and large language support, perfectly serving the most common
  typographic needs.\r\n\r\nread more http://www.type-together.com/Pollen\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pollen_5133.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pollen2_5636.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pollen3_4719.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pollen4_3570.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pollen6_3675.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pollen7_4215.gif]"
