  to take me away to the nuthouse. I&#39;m guessing this font will get me some funny
  looks and raised eyebrows at the next Typophile get-together. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/16269.gif"

    though &#40;because?&#41; he still owes me a t-shirt. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Right now all punctuation is represented by a simple dot. I&#39;ll most likely
    adjust this as soon as I have an idea to support it. Mostly just wanted to get
    this base set out as a proof-of-concept. <BR> <BR>jb

  body: It seems a good example of an upright italic bitmap would be that of Underware&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=unibody&amp;id2=overview"
    target="_blank">unibody</a>. But maybe that isn&#39;t what you need. :^&#92; <BR>

  body: What you need is a one-pixel sep between characters to make your 3-value clumps
    evident. Nice as the wavy line is, it becomes WinAmp-irrelevant in quantity, even
    the &#40;extra-clever&#41; bold version. Do you have a version including letter
    AND graph in one glyph? cause that would be crazy valuable, white coats be darned.
    <BR> <BR>also, to paraphrase TW, Unibody is dopetastic. <BR>I do NOT recommend
    an italic because for pixel characters this requires an overlap of approx. 1 px
    which would further wipe out the graph fidelity. But hey, it&#39;s your brain.
    <BR> <BR>&#39;spect, <BR>-chris

  body: Hrant and his uphill-upright italics battle. <BR>I think this is a great idea,
    and i like that the bars look like eualizer bars, connecting the concept of letters
    as visual references to sounds. <BR> <BR>Good work
