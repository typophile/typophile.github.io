  body: "Thanks for the offer! It's actually not for a setting though, but for an
    extension to an existing Industria-like font. I'd like to check my decisions against
    something \"established\", and since you were at Zhukov's TDC thing it would certainly
    be useful to see the character set of your font, assuming you'd be OK with that.\r\n\r\nAny
    others?\r\n\r\nEmigre's Modula Tall has a Greek, but I guess\r\nnot a Cyrillic,
    not even an \"unofficial\" one?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "well for the de, i and pe, it looks like Tatlin uses script forms for these
    letters. these forms are also used in (some) serif italics, so you could also
    think of these as upright italic forms. Tatlin also uses the Delta shape for the
    upper case De and EL, which fit well with geometric designs (but i might question
    this decision for something so tall...) if i remember rightly, these Delta shaped
    forms originally are associated with renaissance type, although the triangular
    El goes back as far as the inception of Peter the Great's [[Civil Type]] (someone
    correct me if i'm wrong on these points).\r\n\r\nFor a script-informed sans style,
    see <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pauldhunt/428260395/\">this alphabet</a>
    in my flicker stuff."

  body: "Paul, thanks - makes sense - in fact it confirms my suspicions.\r\n\r\nPresumably
    mixing \"roman\" and cursive forms in one font is taboo (and I think I remember
    Zhukov saying something to that effect in his LCT piece). But I have to wonder
    how much readers would really mind.\r\n\r\nBTW, have others put up images from
    the TDC Cyrillic workshop?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
