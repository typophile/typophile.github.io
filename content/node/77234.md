  body: "Also things don't seem to be centered properly. Looking at the dividing line,
    there's more space to the left of the 'P' in 'PRESS' than there is to the right
    of the 'S'. Also the line with 'est. 1995' seems to be aligned with the left side
    of 'RESTAURANT' and there is a large gap to the right. \r\n\r\nThe size relationship
    between 'THE' and 'PRESS' should either be more distinct, or they should be the
    same. Right now 'THE' isn't small enough, but isn't quite large enough either.
    I'd also give more vertical space between them."
