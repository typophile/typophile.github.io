body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am currently redesigning the [[http://www.nordevent.de|website
  of a German event management firm]]. \r\n\r\nAlong the way, the client decided that
  their logo will need a facelift as well, at least in the long-run. The client wants
  to get rid of the stickmen in their current logo and prefers a simple word mark
  instead. They really like the typeface of the current logo (Nimbus sans), however
  I think it lacks some character. That's why I decided to come up with this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ne_logo_4406.png]\r\n\r\nUnfortunaly
  though, I'm not a logo designer by profession and would need some other opinions
  before presenting it to the client. Any ideas on how it could be improved further?
  How about spacing etc.?\r\n\r\nBy the way, \"Nord\" is German for \"North\". \r\n\r\nThanks
  for any input in this matter...\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Just an idea for adding some character to the text: what about adding a little
    arrow or \"circumflex\" above the \"N\". (playing off the direction and the look
    of a compass.) You'll probably want to make sure that it's not intended to simply
    be an accent mark on the \"N\" but an added mark for illustrative purposes. You
    could do that by making it the same color as \"Event\" or maybe red (some compasses
    have red north arrows). Just tossing an idea out there . . .\r\n\r\nAs far as
    spacing goes, you need to tighten the space around the \"o\" (between the \"N\"
    and \"r\") and between the \"e\" and \"n\" in \"Event\". Maybe also  a little
    between the \"n\" and \"t\"."

  body: "I like it. Compass is a idea good, pennANDink. Since the client wants a word
    mark, simply putting \"Nord (North)\" to the top of \"Event\" will present north
    too. In other words you could try a two line version.\r\n\r\nCold colors recede.
    Currently \"Event\" dominates. You could play with the colors. You could also
    try a tighter kerning for \"o\" and \"e\" on both sides."

    \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ne_logo_4398.png]\r\n\r\nI adjusted
    the spacing as you suggested. I also added a compass needle on \"Nord\" but wonder
    if it fits the style of the other letters.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the colour scheme
    can't be changed. I have to stick to the corporate colours here. But that won't
    be too much of a problem I guess...\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

  body: "I love it. So strong. I see \"Nord\" right away and then \"Event\" and the
    arrow now. I guess the arrow is fine. Minimalist and clever. Tells north, future,
    rising and positive things. Using the same tint for \"Event\" and the arrow makes
    \"Nord\" even stronger.\r\n\r\nI also find it procreative. If \"Nord\" decides
    to get into -let's say- finance business some day, you'll just type \"Finance\"
    instead of \"Event\" and it's done.\r\n\r\nThat \"t\" seems lonely out there,
    so I guess a bit tighter kerning could be useful between \"n\" and \"t\" as pennANDink
    suggested while I was writing my previous post."

    got so far:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ne_logo_4133.png]\r\n\r\nNote
    that I also tightened the space between the \"n\" and the \"t\". Is it close enough?\r\n\r\nI'm
    surprised that none of you guys mentioned cap height so far. I stretched the \"E\"
    a little so that it has now the same height as the preceding \"d\". I like that,
    although I can't really say why. The \"E\" is a tad higher than the \"N\" now.
    Not sure if that's good or bad...\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

    now, it looks like they may want something a little more delicate. Even though
    I love this font, they may be looking for something a little more consistent with
    their old face. Sorry I can't help with any specific examples of ones that would
    work, but maybe look at their old logotype to get a feeling.\r\n\r\nAlso, now
    this may be adding a little too much, but what if you colored half the arrow blue
    and left the other half white with just an outline . . . to give it a more compassy
    feel.\r\n\r\nI think the more options you give them this way, the less chance
    they'll have to stay with their current look.\r\n\r\nWhatever you do, I hope you
    convince them to see things your way. Good luck.\r\n\r\npenn"
