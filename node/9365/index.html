		<div class="commentbody">Me too. <BR> <BR>I &quot;knew&quot; Justin mostly in that virtual online sense, though we met briefly once or twice at conferences. I gave him some tips on OpenType development, and he asked lots of very reasonable questions. <BR> <BR>Recently Adobe had an issue with our next-gen apps and ITC Founders Caslon, which he was a great help in debugging. It turned out to be something I decided to fix on our end, but he would have been happy to revise his fonts if it would help. <BR> <BR>Justin was always friendly, courteous, intellectually engaged, and when it came to design/technology decisions quite focused on the actual users of his typeface. <BR> <BR>My last non-mass email from him was two weeks ago today. <BR> <BR>It all feels very unreal, somehow. <BR>Goodbye, Justin. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sent from <a href="http://www.stbride.org/index.htm" target="_blank">Friends of St Bride</a> today: <BR> <BR>A service of thanksgiving for Justin's life will be held in St Bride <BR>church on 9 May 2005 at 3pm. <BR> <BR>Justin was one of the strongest supporters of the Friends and his <BR>untimely death will be keenly felt. He was responsible for <BR>re-establishing the Friends in 1998 and was our Chairman until 2003. <BR>Since then Justin has continued to support us, giving gifts to the <BR>library up to a few weeks ago. Without Justin the Friends would simply <BR>not exist and we will always be indebted to him. The Friends was not the <BR>only cause that Justin championed. It was largely thanks to his efforts <BR>that the archives of the Sheffield based typefounders Stephenson Blake <BR>were preserved in the Type Museum. Until recently Justin also worked in <BR>the Type Museum as part-time curator. <BR> <BR>Always busy with many projects, Justin always found the time to share <BR>his knowledge with others and many of us will miss his help and advice <BR>as well as his friendship. Over the years he made many contributions in <BR>the field of printing history beginning with articles in Matrix and Isis <BR>while studying as an undergraduate at Christ Church College, Oxford. He <BR>then edited Edward Johnston's Lessons in formal writing with Heather <BR>Child, published by Lund Humphries in 1986. A year later he published a <BR>catalogue of the Edward Johnston Collection at the Crafts Study Centre <BR>at Bath University. He remained fascinated by Johnston and later wrote <BR>Johnston's underground type, published by Capital Transport in 2000. He <BR>also published in numerous journals and lectured across the country and <BR>abroad on a number of different subjects. <BR> <BR>Justin was a typographer as well as a printing historian. He was <BR>responsible for designing many books, some quite sumptuous, but will be <BR>remembered in particular for his masterful digital version of the Caslon <BR>typeface. <BR> <BR>Perhaps the saddest thing about Justin's death is that he left so many <BR>projects unfinished, some of which had been long-term ambitions that <BR>were soon to bear fruit &ndash; his six-month stay at the Plantin-Moretus <BR>Museum in Antwerp and his PhD on the development of letterforms and <BR>concepts of lettering, 1680–1830 to name but two. <BR> <BR>Our thoughts are with his parents at this time. <BR> <BR>Justin's obituary in The Times: <BR><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0%2C" target="_blank">1-45-1505298%2C00.html,http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-45-1505298,00.html</a></div>
