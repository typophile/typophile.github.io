  body: That look a bit like &#34;Crank 8&#34;, which is used throughout Esquire Magazine
    &#40;although usually in a less-bold weight than this&#41;. Crank 8 is currently
    sitting atop my list of drool-worthy fonts, but it is apparently not available
    to the public. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"
