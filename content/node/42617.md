  body: "As tintin points out, it's too large to reasonably look at.  Try making it
    600px wide, and get rid of the whitespace.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see: get rid
    of the gradient at this point in the process.  Also, work on a version without
    the tagline - integrating a logo with a tagline is dangerous, since clients often
    want to change a tagline.\r\n\r\nSeems like a good start - I look forward to seeing
    it reposted!"

  body: "Where it's definitely \"creatif\" it's also over designed. The word mark
    is interesting, but once you start adding the other elements it gets crowded and
    overly complex. I agree with Beth's suggestions. For the initial, start with a
    straight black and white design, minus taglines and revolving elements (like the
    Xacto).\r\n\r\nFocusing on the wordmark, the \"TiF\" seems compressed and smooshed
    onto the end, and I think the \"F\"'s arms could extend further out. The balance
    and rhythm seem out of whack.\r\n\r\nAs for the Xacto, you could use this element
    in several renditions including a version with a pen, pencil, paintbrush, etc...
    But right now it's a very heavy bottom element and could be thinned and elongated.\r\n\r\nThe
    font choice for your tag line is too different, the majority of your design is
    very angular, the C being the only noticeable curve. Maintain this look. It's
    hard to justify a curved font with this logo.\r\n\r\nI know I've been pretty harsh.
    The logo has a distinct look, but it's at a point were it should either be pulled
    back or pusher further. Keep up the good work, enjoy the process and make mistakes!"

    the scalpel, I'm also a fan of the subtle gradient you've placed on the [original]
    image - congratulations!"

  body: "Looks good but I'd argue that you don't need the x-acto at all.\r\n\r\nIf
    you do keep it, consider rotating the element in different uses...ie, x-acto,
    brush, pencil, etc."

  body: I agree, the x-acto isn't necessary. The tif portion does seem a bit unbalanced
    as someone said earlier. Otherwise it's nice.

  body: 'To agree with the others: get the logotype just right, then develop some
    alternating logomarks (x-acto, etc).  For the logotype, the huge counter of the
    C is currently unbalanced, to my eye. Making the F a stronger presence might solve
    that.'

    is the C. I reckon it needs to move up a little bit."

  body: Unfortunately, I think the E might have been making use of the xacto knife
    in order for it not to read as an "f" - you can accept that, and use the knife,
    or make the E & T wider.  Lookin' good!

  body: What if you extend the lowest bar of the E to take some emphasis off the A?
    The A seems big because it is not cropped at all. The T could interrupt the A
    also. I agree that the C should go up and maybe in toward the R as well.
