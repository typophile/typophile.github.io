  body: "Cartoon Bold was the original (predigital) name. There are various, mostly
    poorly made versions out there. Fontbank (long defunct) digitized it as <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/caricature.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Caricature</a> (and the Xara folks claim to have the rights
    to the Fontbank fonts now).\r\n\r\nIt also appeared on CorelDraw CDs as 'Cancun'."
