  body: "A cat and dog thread!\r\n\r\nOf the sans variations, I like the second b
    the least. (And probably also the second n [which works fine in the italic version],
    but the second d doesn't bother me.) And your s is falling a bit forward. \r\n\r\nI
    look forward to seeing how this develops."

  body: I like the paw its cute!  I like the 1st b and 2nd b the third looks as if
    it is about to roll off.  I like the lower case 1st g, however it seems too symmetrical.  All
    in all good job, but don't leave the bolds and the blacks out J/K.  Good look
    and Happy Holidays to you and everyone else!

    was my intention. Maybe I use the second g for the cursive version.\r\n\r\nWith
    respect to the s, you are right. There\u2019s something rare... perhaps with this
    modification (see picture)\r\n\r\nHappy Holidays!\r\n\r\nP.D. Dogs and cats usually

  body: "Did you also condense the \"u\", just like you did with \"n\"?\r\nOtherwise
    UC looks nice. But to my eye F, Z and M look a bit too narrow compared to others,
    K looks a bit top heavy, try matching Q's tail with \"g\"'s, match \"S\"'s shape
    with \"s\", V, X and Y are almost certainly too wide...\r\n\r\nBut the font itself
    looks really nice and it is quite original in shape. I like it a lot. Also its
    light weight looks very nice so combining it with nice small details makes it
    more appropriate for display. I like it a lot. Very calming, warm and inviting.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert
