  creating fake magazine spreads to learn the software.\r\n\r\nWhile i find it fairly
  easy to choose appropriate fonts for headlines and logos, I'm a bit stuck when it
  comes to which fonts to use for body copy. At the mo' I tend to just stick with
  Caslon Pro but not sure if it's the right choice. I tend to just look at my pages
  of text on the screen and can't decide if it's actually good or bad.\r\n\r\nCan
  you recommend any fonts (serif or san-serif)? I'd also appreciate any info on the
  fonts well known magazines are known to use for their body copy.\r\n\r\nWould also
  appreciate info on which fonts might be used for various types of magazines (Glossy
  womens mags, video games mags, music mags etc) (I realise there's no one set answer
  - just some ideas/info would be great).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDan"

    few things listening in on the amazing and talented typographers and designers
    that hang out around here.\r\n\r\nHave you read all the great discussions on magazine
    redesign so far on this forum?  Google \"site:typophile.com magazine redesign\".
    \ You will see A LOT of discussions.  They will give you lots of ideas.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Atypophile.com+magazine+redesign&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&oq=\r\n\r\nI
    found it helpful to first get familiar with why a designer went from typeface
    A to typeface B.  What was the problem with the old one that he/she was trying
    to solve?  How did the new one solve that problem?\r\n\r\nThen you can begin to
    see how to think through what you're trying to do and let that guide your own
    decisions.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nWhat did Erik Spiekermann [[http://www.stepinsidedesign.com/STEPMagazine/Article/28761|do
    for the Economist]] and why?  \r\n\r\nWhy did some magazines decide to go with
    [[http://www.type-together.com/typeinuse.php|Ronnia and Karmina]] as their sans
    and serif? What do these typefaces actually <em>do</em> for a magazine or newspaper?\r\n\r\nWhat
    was the problem Hoefler&Frere-Jones were trying to help Martha Stuart Living solve
    when they [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100033|created
    the slab serif Archer]]?\r\n\r\nIf you can start to think in this manner, you
    might arrive at a handful of choices.  And then you just pick one that works.
    \ And change it when it stops working.\r\n\r\nHave a lot of fun in your search
    & learning!\r\nRahim\r\n"

    on typophile 'When in doubt, just use Adobe Caslon.' 'Nobody notices it, nobody
    complains about it.'\r\nAnd I agree. Caslon is sturdy and flexible \u2013 thus
    highly functional. Perhaps that is why I find it a bit boring.\r\n\r\nBrieck"
