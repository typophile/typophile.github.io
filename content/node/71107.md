  this might sound like an ignorant question, but work with me, here: are there any
  typefaces out there that look mozambican or are somewhat inspired by Mozambique?
  Maybe that doesn't actually exist; what about just generally african?\r\nI mean
  something along the lines of: if you want your design to look english, you can go
  with Gill, maybe Caslon, Bulmer, Baskerville; if you want french, Didot, maybe something
  like some Auriol; german, fraktur blackletters or Bauhaus inspired stuff or something
  along those lines; italian, Bodoni or maybe Centaur. You know, I'm looking for the
  stereotypical typographic choices. Stereotypes might be bad and wrong, but they
  do have their uses. (In fact, I'd appreciate if you shared some more stereotypical
  type choices like those ones, I always find these interesting.)\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm
  aware of what I'm saying here; I'm aware that Africa is a very culturally rich continent
  and that african countries are definitely not all the same and that having one typeface
  somehow \u201Crepresent\u201D an entire continent might be offensive and just plain
  wrong, let alone when we use typefaces to represent just one country, but still.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  besides that, I'd like to know if there are any successful/renowned african type
  designers. I'd love to get to know typefaces coming from an entirely different culture
  and background with different influences, like that. Once more, I'd also appreciate
  and enjoy anything along those lines but coming from other continents (which will
  obviously also mean other alphabets and even other writing systems), but my focus
  here, right now, is Africa and, more specifically, Mozambique, and the roman alphabet."

  body: "Oh, right\u2026 I forgot I should've searched it beforehand. Sorry. Thanks,
    Nick!\r\n\r\nWhat's said on that other thread echoes what I already thought and
    concluded \u2013 that going for rough, wood-type-like stuff or even just roughly
    painted display letters is what's more usual, that it's a fact that there isn't
    a definite overall graphic identity in regards to roman type or even type in general,
    etc. \u2013, but I was still looking for some opinions and ideas on this. For
    instance, I really don't know why, but to me Chaparral kind of suggests Africa,
    in a strange way, even though the name is spanish (the word actually also exists
    in portuguese) and the text accompanying the typeface suggests it's somehow inspired
    in an american landscape. I was looking/hoping for suggestions such as this one."

  body: "Hello Ruben,\r\n\r\nI think I get what your saying but at first glance and
    first read it looks like you may be stepping in a bit of a \"minefield\" since
    the topic of race and type and even steering the intended audience towards certain
    racial stereotypes by using certain typefaces can be a sticky and at time heated
    topic. See [[http://www.studio-gs.com/neuland.html|here]] for some more info on
    what I am talking about.\r\n\r\nBut to answer your questions:\r\n\r\nI'm thinking
    everyone might steer you towards any derivation of Koch's Neuland and then tell
    you about Twombly's Lithos, which in certain contexts can get the job done. They
    were not intentionally made to represent Africa or even the millions in the African
    Diaspora but these fonts have been firmly cemented in the minds of art directors
    and consumers alike as the ultimate in African typography. But this is almost
    like always using Costello's Papyrus to represent anything Egyptian. Aside from
    those options you may be able to find other stereotypical \"African\" fonts [[www.design-africa.com|here]].
    Though as a Ghanian-American designer, I don't really like fonts like the ones
    on the site I have led you to, I have to understand and recognize that they exist
    and address the fact that the \"African\" voice needs to be more developed in
    the type world.\r\n\r\nAs for your question about successful/renowned African
    type designers...there are some but  not as many as there should be. Let's see:
    \ Anton and Merle Scholtz from Scholtz fonts in Durban, South Africa, Andrew van
    der Merwe of Cape Town, Christine Voigts of Namibian/German descent, Saki Mafundikwa
    of the ZIVA Institute of Zimbabwe to name a few. Oh and I also forgot [[http://type.akofa.com|myself]]...although
    I'm not world renowned yet I still am of African descent and make typefaces.\r\n\r\n@NickShinn
    - What's happenin' Nick!\r\n"

  body: "Thank you very much, sasabonsam!\r\n\r\nI'm aware of all that, but I was
    looking to go beyond that and get to the point without being stuck on that. I'm
    not even thinking about race or anything, I really just wanted to know how I could
    evoke a certain country or continent in a subtle way. No one really needs to get
    it or to understand it; I'm sure most people don't get that some designers are
    evoking England with Gill Sans in their quietly designed tea package. It's just
    a matter of, on the one hand, having something to hold on to while choosing the
    typeface, and on the other, maybe somehow suggesting the atmosphere of the continent."

    has already passed, so this isn't urgent anymore, but I'm still interested in
    getting some other suggestions for next time around."
