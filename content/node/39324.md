  Any suggestions?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Alisal_6298.gif] "

    earlier today.\r\n\r\nWhat isn't usable about the lowercase g? (kinda being sarcastic.)"

  body: I like it. But it's sorta like Goudy Sans' upper case A. Nice, but once is
    enough.

  body: Can you describe what you mean by "chunky"? It's one of those words that has
    a different meaning to every reader -- especially when describing type.

    Figural and <em>Palatino</em> is as close as your gonna get.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    actually. I was looking for something like what the Seattle Poat-Intelligencer
    uses as a secondary serifed headline font. After closer examination, ITC Mendoza
    IS what the P-I uses.)\r\n\r\n+1 for Stewf"
