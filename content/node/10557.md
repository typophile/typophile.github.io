    shape the designer intended for each    <BR>letter is lost and the result is ugly
    spacing.    <BR>    <BR>I dont exactly know what you mean by what    <BR>happens

  body: By stretching or compressing a font you hurt the integrity of the original
    design. Just because you can do it on a computer, it doesn&#39;t mean you should.
    What didn&#39;t work in hot metal should be a nono in dtp as well. It&#39;s just
    bad. It&#39;s not creative, not even in a destructive way, it&#39;s just bull.
    The dynamic of the width and weights and proportions of the type is destroyed
    by such electronic manipulations. And THAT is why you don&#39;t like it - it just
    looks awful :-D

    working, I only care about the intent of one designer: me. <BR> <BR>There are
    some good reasons this commonly held rule is taught in every freshman typography

    There are some obvious problems that happen, but the reality is, many faces have

    the time. And I&#39;m not ashamed of it. Sometimes I edit the outlines to correct
    some of the problems caused by expansion. I think all designers should be able
    to &#39;get under the hood&#39; of a font and tinker a little bit. Too many are
    scared to do so. I have seen too many logos that are simply type set in a common
    face, displaying no originality or creativity. Since when was the shape of the

    that Tschichold dude... If YOU want a 250% stretched Sabon, that MUST be right.
    :-&#41; Sorry.. If yiou are a good designer, which I assume, you respect the work
    of others. In each and any case. I understand that in certain cases you can consciously
    destroy a font, just like you&#39;d do with image material in photoshop, to get
    a certain effect... If you work on a logo, mod the shape of the font and try to
    aim for a certain effect and the end result is good... More power to you, I do
    similar stuff myself, I recently rebuilt SunLight extremely for a Logo for ikf,
    basically changing those three letters completely, but still retaining the unique
    flair of the font. I also don&#39;t think that a, say, Carsonesque work needs
    much respect for  typography. However, in a normal, maybe longer text that you
    want anybody to read, it isn&#39;t only about respect for the likes of Giambastita
    Bodoni, but also for the reader. Have you ever seen a layman mangle type in CorelDraw
    or in &#40;ugh&#41; WordArt.... And how many ads or even brochures have you seen
    in which the font is stretched to 150% I recently was to identify the type of
    a logo for a friend and failed miserably at it, until it struck me that some idiot
    had sretched Aichers Rotis to 280% ... And that was why it looked so rotten.  <BR>
    <BR>As usual: If DONE right, breaking the rules is a GOOD thing. If a layman,
    a person wihout the right sensibilities to destroy rules in order to aim for a
    specific creative effect, does it... it&#39;s hurlsville. HD'

  body: 'HD Schnellnack is right. <BR>When I began using the Mac &#40;around 1989&#41;
    everyone stretched type in any possible way. <BR>It was just the fascination of  doing
    it &#40;expecially some LetraStudio craze crappy results!&#41; <BR> <BR>If you
    know the rules you can do nice things. For example, compressing slightly Gill
    Sans Bold on the x-axis improves it &#40;I mean around a 95-96%, not more&#41;
    because it tends to get  too wide compared to other weights. <BR> <BR>What I found
    fun as a teenage badboy typographer was working against the structure of a face:
    if you try to enlarge Helvetica Compressed, Inserat or ExtraCompressed exaggerately
    on the x-axis the results are unexpected &#40;and rarely used&#41;. Same thing
    doing the opposite with wide and extended faces. Or trying straightening some
    italics. <BR> <BR>Anyway, stretching is exactly what separates a designer from
    an amateur, and this is good because it helps you spot out the crap at a glance.
    <BR> <BR>The thing I always find &#42;sick&#42; is the distortion of types with
    circular Os, like Futura or Avant Garde. A luck my Ottomat came out when the stretching
    craze was well over. <BR>I have not seen it stretched so far. <BR> <BR>Typefaces
    working even if stretched are in general the ones without curves and modulation:
    I did a very simple typeface way before Ottomat named Boom which you could squeeze
    and stretch at your pleasure. <BR>It was inspired by John Workman&#39;s lettering
    on comic-books drawn by Walt Simonson in the late 1980s &#40;Thor, Fantastic Four&#41;.
    Of course it worked best if an outline was dropped behind the white type, as a
    sound effect. <BR> <BR>In general, you could even use LetraStudio &#40;or the
    FreeHand and Illustrator tools&#41; to distort sensences, but you need to adjust
    very skillfully the handles and vary the width, point size and inclination of
    each letter. Afterwards, a bit of amnual redesign is required. <BR>In this way
    it&#39;s very much like designing distorted type by hand.'

  body: 'I recently manually reworked the m of the TheSans Mono for a logo of a firm
    called crimecompany, as it is a bit too narrow for my taste... I think Luc went
    for a compromise to have an overall nice width for the monospace, but with TWO
    m in one word, it felt all wrong, and yet the typeface itself was perfectly right
    for what I wanted. So I worked direktly with the path and moved some of the nodes
    horizontically... Which resulted in a VERY controlled kind of stretching a single
    letter, making the typographic part of the logo more individual while not being
    some kind of electronic universal stretch without any aesthetic feel for the lettershape.
    You&#39;re right though, there are plenty of books on microtypography that even
    argue for the controlled stretching of certain fonts as it enhances their look
    because the digital version is messed up or not true to the original design...
    Thus, sometimes a microscopic amount of stretching can actually help the typography,
    just as in many many cases a bit more overall spacing than the design of the font
    originally has makes for better legibility &#40;RotisSemiSans and UniversLightCondensed
    spring to mind&#41;. '

    its carelessness Carson rarely stretches type. If you look carefully at Ray Gun,
    behind the chaos there are often quite classical &#40;albeit unconsciously&#41;
    layouts. I mean in terms of balance, white space, justapositions, etc. <BR> <BR>Carson
    tampers mostly with spacing, which is a different thing. A thing to notice anywyay
    it&#39;s his choice he&#39;s always been for good typefaces. <BR> <BR>In ray Gun,
    despite the many hacked fonts, he often chose beautiful classic or modern types,
    like Perpetua, Joanna, Rotis, for the body text. <BR> <BR>In one of his last books
    &#40;fotografiks&#41; he uses everywhere the beautiful Simona &#40;formerly Arno
    Nuovo&#41; by John Downer, mixed occasionally with some Franklin Gothic-like type.
    This book is beautiful because its&#39; most on imagery, not text.

    great typographer. He cares very little for actual content, which is a shame,
    as most of his work has a superficial, masturbatory quality sometimes... but as
    such it is very artful, very intuitive and his choice of positioning images and
    type and in the typefaces he uses is often superb. He&#39;s often been reduced
    to the Mr. Dirty Fonts and overkill-design, but many of his works are subtle and
    clean and just a bit wicked and thinking outside the box and sometimes even downright
    evil, f&#42;&#42;&#42;ing with the readers mind in very clever ways. He&#39;s
    sadly become a clich=E9, often and badly = copied and he himself hasn&#39;t done
    too much beyond his own scope, like the ever-great Dave McKean more or less recycling
    his own ideas sometimes, but in my own humble option Dave was and still is an
    artist whose work I love just as much as that of Vaughan Oliver or Dirk Rudolph
    or Bill Cahan... As it still is unique and has grown immensely over the years,
    so despite the many epigones that have copied it, it still has a lot of merit,
    I think. I&#39;m quite looking forward to that McLuhan book David is doing...=20

    out some 4 years after he got the Ray Gun gig, if you see it that way. And frankly,
    I&#39;d done it as well. Being a designer is a job, and being poaid good money
    for doing exactly what you want to do, only on a bigger budget with bigger clients...
    There&#39;s no shame in that and I don&#39;t ever remember Carson being anti-capitalist
    or something like that. He&#39;s in a solid business position now, and for a small
    freelance designer, that&#39;s not someting to be ashamed of. He&#39;s still doing
    solid work, and of course his position, like that of most of us is a compromise
    between doing what your heart tells you to do and doing what you must do to pay
    the rent and school for the kids or something like that. I don&#39;t feel that
    David has lost much of his integrity, if he has, then so has Bill Cahan and so
    have Charles Anderson and Jo Duffy and many other successful designers. Of course,
    the change from Ray Gun to Pepsi was a MASTER example of the =ABCounter-Culture-to-Over-The-Counter-Culture=BB-process,
    but that is = true for all independent or alternative form of expression these
    days. Some small fashion designer has a unique idea, and it effing soo will be

    simply is right. I worked for Dirk Rudolph for some months and I think he has
    that very same inner magic. Without grid, without any planning at all, he just
    puts stuff somewhere on the page and it looks right. And after that, when I started
    to build grids for myself, based on his rough designs, I dound out that he very
    often was perfectly within a certain kind of grid =96 he just didn&#39;t know
    it, it came from pure intuition. Very cool.=20 ... =20 Dave McKean is one of the
    reasons why I got into this business. I came across him the first time on the
    covers of Sandman # 4 and quickly got the backissues and of course anything else
    he had done before. Although I find his work a bit self-repetetive these days,
    I&#39;m still a huge fan. You can find much of his work and many links here: <a
    href="http://www.dreamline.nu/" target="_blank">http://www.dreamline.nu/</a>.
    His Option Click book is purely photographic montage, his PICTURES THAT Tick is
    more comics-related but there are some nice non-comic pages that show another
    side of his work. I hear a new book is coming up that is more design-related again.
    Of course, the best book so far, imo, is Dust Covers, a collection of his Sandman
    work, which I still love best, as the bridge between Neils stories and Dave&#39;s
    artwork is just so wonderful and the book is marvelously done, featuring lots
    of private photographs and some images of his workspace.. Very nice look behind
    the curtain, here. His use of fonts is a bit... Well, overdone, I think it fits
    the bombastic majesty of his images very nicely, but it still is very over-the-top.
    I really liked the fact that Vaughan had used the Sabon in his recent monography...
    That kind of restraint is maybe something we can use nowadays, after the visual
    overkill of the 90s, I think there IS a reason why we see more classical typefaces
    popping up these days even from independent labels like <a href="http://www.fountain.nu.=20"

    didn&#39;t recognize your name though, sorry. No wonder you like Frank Heine&#39;s

    effing versatile the guy is. I know his work since RAW and L=F6schblatt, which
    I begged him to give to = me 10 years back or so.=20 ... =20 Incidentally, I met
    Dirk Uhlenbrock on Friday for the first time &#40;face to face that is&#41;, but
    knew of him for some time, thanks to Fontomas. Nice guy, nice style, nice company.
    It felt eery, as so many details mirror my own life &#40;quit the University,
    small bureau of three folks, with him doing print and Martin the Flash-prog-stuff
    plus a trainee, identically the same structure I have&#41;. I think he does more
    Illustration, while I&#39;m more into manipulating phtography &#40;well, I AM
    a Rudolph-fan and cannot seem to get that out of my system at all&#41;. We live
    in the same quartrer of the town and met with some other designers, initially
    because I mailed him to offer assistance after Knut vanished, but it looks as
    if things aren&#39;t too much out of hand professionally, if not in terms of this
    very messed-up-situation of loosing your brother. I really dig the MASSIVE j.otto
    seybold feeling in Dirks work and like many of the things I&#39;ve seen from him.
    It was a nice talk, especially with Martin, who =96 like me =96 is a massive comic
    book fan, and since = he&#39;s more into Indie stuff &#40;I&#39;m straight Superhero,
    more or less&#41;, it was very informative and I got a kick out of hearing what
    independent comic books are worth giving a try. Signalgrau almost feels like a

    work together more, all these itty bitty design bureaus everywhere, it seems as
    if we&#39;re all making ourselves smaller than we actually are... Anyway, it was

    and HD Shellnack    <BR>about knowing the rules and knowing when to break them.    <BR>That&#39;s
    the essence of graphic design.    <BR>   <BR>Changing the subject somewhat:   <BR>   <BR>I&#39;ve
    known some designers who get away with stretching or   <BR>contracting a face
    by about 3% to fit the copy better. What    <BR>do you think, is this better or
    worse than adjusting the    <BR>letterspacing to get the same result?'

    The big S is to heavy for the rest of the word, as well. Why is there a full stop
    at the end and why so close to the l. Jesus, why can&#39;t some people become
    landscape gardeners or telephone sanitizers? Jesus...  <BR> <BR>3% stretching
    isn&#39;t that much, but might destroy a typeface like Sabon or Bodoni completely,
    delicate as they are. I think they&#39;d fare better with word spacing and letter
    spacing and such stuff.  <BR> <BR>Hmm... I just noticed that when I answer via
    eMail my response looses any kind of formatting and also the umlaute are all wrong...
    is there any way to format my answers that come via eMail with some HTML or abbreviated
    HTML-codes? That response to Claudio looks like hell :-D.  <BR> <BR>Sorry about
    that,maybe I&#39;ll do some more online-answering. But answering via eMail is
    soooo comfortable :-D. '

    Sun-Fonts don&#39;t work porpoerly with InDesign &#40;or rather vice versa&#41;.
    If you switch from regular to Small Caps, the text is lost, replaced by a pinkish
    field and you have to re-enter it. As this lends to typing errors when you ave
    to re-type stuff and all in all isn&#39;t very workflow-friendly when typesetting
    a larger publication &#40;I use sun for the 28-pages newsletter of the Institut
    f&uuml;r Kredit- und Finanzwirtschaft&#41;, I started to fake my own caps in InDesign.
    When the regular Text is light, I use the normal weight, decrease the type-size
    so that the upper-case letters have a bit more than the x-height of the regular
    sized light-font and then do stretch it a bit. With a bit of spacing, it looks
    almost identical to what Luc did in the Light Small Caps and the reader won&#39;t
    notice any difference at all. As I noticed that Luc&#40;as&#41; HAD optically
    stretched the SmallCaps somewhat, I did the same thing. I&#39;d wish, he&#39;d
    fix that '

  body: '&#62;Death: the time of your life <BR>Claudio, as I have almost all comics
    by Neil in their original single-comic version, I never got the hardcover collection.
    I have a picture of the softcover edition somewhere in an old notebook, but even
    on the web I haven&#39;t found an image of he hardcover. At Amazon and Barnes
    they don&#39;t have it. I&#39;ll see what I can don on various comic boards for
    you... but why don&#39;t you simply write an eMail to Dave. If he uses your fonts,
    he&#39;ll probably be happy to hear from the creator himself and get praised heaped
    upon himself ... I know I&#39;d flip :-D. '
