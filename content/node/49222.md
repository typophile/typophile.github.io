  and my resume for a job this week and wanted to have some members here go over part
  of it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rosem.com/work/portfolio/\r\n\r\nI'm basically looking
  for any feedback/suggestions along with typos, etc...\r\n\r\nIt's for a Web Development
  job, but I thought I would add this section which shows more of my print design
  work.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike"

  body: Your navigation arrows are very hard to see. I almost missed them entirely.
    I would make it navigable by clicking on the picture, also, if you can't lighten
    the arrows.

  body: "If you go to http://www.rosem.com/work/ you get to see the entire directory
    structure and get an access to a lot of different works and files that might not
    be intended for visitors. Might be a good idea to create a blank index.html there.

  body: "I could see the arrows, but maybe I was a bit influenced by just reading
    Sharons comment. \r\n\r\nI think it looks nice. It's clean. It was very fun to
    see the logos that you've posted on here before for critique. \r\n\r\nIf anything
    I might work on some of the comments about the work. I'm not sure at this point
    it really adds to the work. I'd suggest either using more in-depth commentary
    or just leave it totally basic, like just use the company name that the actual
    design was for."

    you base it on an existing system or create it yourself / from scratch, if I may
