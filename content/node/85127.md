  1934 for the Ludwig & Mayer foundry. The most characters I have come across so far
  is <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/WHyVq.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">this image</a>. Any
  help would be great. Sorry if this was something that should have belonged in Type
  ID.\r\n"

    it\u2019s indeed spelled \u201CAugspurg\u201D."

    of Type Faces</em> in regular and boldface, but there are only a few more characters
    displayed than in the posted image.\r\n\r\nProofreaders make mistakes, especially
    when dealing with proper names. I tend to lend a little more credence to the Klingspor
    spelling."
