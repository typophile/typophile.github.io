body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI posted a question a while back about a suitable replacement
  for Our Bodoni Light for body copy in a Magazine. The whole idea was scrapped for
  a few months and now I'm having another go at it. The mag is a lifestyle title,
  focusing on fashion, food, culture, celebrity etc. It targets upper middle class
  Canadians. I'm looking for something with a vertical axis and a fairly large x-height
  that doesn't feel too dark on the page as the mag is quite text heavy. I've tried
  out several other Bodonis and think it's best to stray away from them. We use Trade
  gothic for headers and captions and I'm having some difficulty finding something
  that fits. I'm stumped.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions??"

    Modern</a>, a Walbaum (Storm's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/walbaum-text/\">Walbaum
    Text</a> is nice if you're looking for something with lower contrast), <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/miller/\">Miller</a>,
    maybe <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/didot/\">Didot</a> if you're
    going very high contrast, <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/worldwide/\">Worldwide</a>
    (but that's probably too heavy), and <a href=http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/whittingham-bq/\">Whittingham</a>
    (another Scotch revival).\r\n\r\nOther, slightly crazier ideas include Perpetua
    (probably x-height too small), Fenice, New Caledonia, or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/farnham/\">Farnham</a>
    (display weights should be nice and light).\r\n\r\nHope this helps."

  body: "Michael:\r\n\r\nWhen designing a historically-based typeface as a survey
    of a genre - in the case of Brunel, the English Moderns released by a number of
    foundries (including but not limited to the work of the Caslon foundry and John
    Isaac Drury) between about 1790 and 1850, as Matthew Carter's Miller is a survey
    of Scotch Romans from a number of different punchcutters - rather than a revival
    of a specific typeface, one of the main challenges is deciding which divergent
    forms are worth keeping, and how to prioritize them. It's the same old problem
    any responsible designer runs into when reviving something old: how do you balance
    making an accurate record of what existed while making something relevant to contemporary
    typography?\r\n\r\nIn the case of the italic v and w, Paul felt that the earlier,
    more idiosyncratic forms of v and w, which are structurally quite similar to the
    Transitionals that came just before the first Moderns (i.e. the work of Richard
    Austin or John Baskerville), were interesting and beautiful, and well worth making
    the default form in part because they make a statement about the early Moderns,
    which tended to be much more organic than the later ones. This form was simplified
    over the following decades into the simpler, more familiar v and w, and we have
    included those as alternates as well. I'm generally not fond of stuffing fonts
    full of alternates, because I feel that they can quickly turn into a type designer
    avoiding making choices about what a typeface should look like, but in this case
    the alternate v and w seemed necessary, as they were also historically accurate
    and important.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Brunelvw_5524.gif]\r\n\r\n(edited

  body: "Christian\r\n\r\nIt is not that I think that the \"wild and crazy\" w should
    not have been a part of the font, just maybe in a secondary position... as the
    alternate. To me as a calligrapher/lettering artist I think they stick out as
    a sore thumb! Not ugly mind you!  but maybe like a disruptive child in a classroom.
    Purely and simply subjective on my part... not to cast aspersions. I see a more
    cohesive flow in the second eg. Especially for text.\r\n\r\nNice work by the way,
    as always a class act.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: Wow, thanks for all the suggestions everyone. I'm currently sorting through,
    seeing which might fit. Raph you mentioned using a display weight of Farnham,
    is that ok practice? Doesn't the higher contrast end up making it harder to read?
