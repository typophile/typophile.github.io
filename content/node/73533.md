    CONTRACT INTENDED FOR END-USERS\r\n\r\nAuthorization of AW CONQUEROR DIDOT Font,
    AW CONQUEROR SANS Font, AW CONQUEROR INLINE Font, AW CONQUEROR CARVED Font, AW
    CONQUEROR SLAB Font\r\n\r\nWhereas: This contract governs the use of the abovementioned
    typeface and the fonts that comprise it, as described on the Web pages of the
    present Internet site: conqueror.com and/or in the Conqueror catalogue.\r\n\r\n#1.
    DEFINITIONS.\r\nA typeface (or a font) is a complete set of glyphs that comply
    with the standard for Western countries\u2019 typefaces used by Apple Macintosh
    and Microsoft Windows systems.\r\nFormat of the font(s): The font(s) is/are in
    the OpenType format for the stated platform and consist of metric data that is
    digitally encoded, with digital descriptions of the outlines of all of the glyphs.\r\n\r\n#2
    OBJECT.\r\nThis licensing contract covers a usage licence with non-exclusive rights
    intended for the use of the typeface (font) and offered to the end-user on the
    Web pages of the present Internet site: conqueror.com and/or in the Conqueror
    catalogue, which belong to the Arjowiggins company. This company distributes,
    for a stipulated period of time and under licence from Typofonderie, the typeface
    and the fonts comprising it.\r\n\r\n#3 DURATION.\r\nThis licence is contracted
    for an indefinite period of time and takes effect on the date on which the present
    contract is accepted.\r\n\r\n# 4 SCOPE OF THE LICENCE.\r\n#4.1 Ownership of the
    fonts.\r\nTypofonderie shall retain full ownership of the digital descriptions
    and/or the digital fonts that define the typeface and/or fonts as described on
    the pages of the conqueror.com website and/or in the Conqueror catalogue. Under
    no circumstances shall the End-user be entitled to transfer to any other party
    the typefaces and/or fonts described on the Web pages of the present Internet
    site: conqueror.com and/or in the Conqueror catalogue. The typefaces and/or fonts
    and their components are protected by intellectual property rights legislation
    and copyright laws, and shall remain the property of Typofonderie. The fonts may
    not be denatured and/or altered in any manner whatsoever. Any creation of derivative
    fonts based on the fonts in question is formally prohibited. This includes manipulation
    of this digital font in order to mix it with another, drawing on its composition
    for inspiration, using the shape of each of its symbols and their positions (in
    any manner other than simple pair matchings that leave the original intact), modifying
    its digital format in order to benefit another format, or modifying the hinting
    included which controls display quality and printing quality. Making up, having
    made up or giving permission to make up derivatives of the typeface and its components,
    or making typefaces with resemblance to the typeface package and its components
    in any form whatsoever is strictly forbidden and renders the counterfeiter legally
    liable.\r\n\r\nThe following text applies to all of the components of the typeface:
    \u201CCopyright \xA9 2009, by Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez, Typofonderie. All rights
    reserved. Distributed exclusively by Arjowiggins under license from Typofonderie.
    Any distribution to a third party is prohibited. Names are trademarks in some
    cases.\u201D\r\n\r\n#4.2 Work station(s), output unit(s) and place of use.\r\nThis
    licence allows the fonts to be used by an unlimited number of work stations in
    a single workplace.\r\n\r\n#4.3 Finished product media.\r\nThis licence is applicable
    only in those cases where the finished product(s) are in hard copy or a digital
    medium endowed with the specific feature of preventing extraction of the fonts
    or font elements (\u201Conly printing and display\u201D preferences for pdf format)
    by a third party that might use the fonts for applications other than those for
    which they are sold. Use of the fonts on servers accessible via the Internet or
    similar networks, and the redistribution of documents or commercially-available
    software incorporating these fonts to third parties is forbidden. Any use by the
    End-user on digital products allowing extraction of the fonts or font elements
    as defined above by a third party will render the End-user liable de facto.\r\n\r\n#4.5
    Intuitu personae nature of this licence and strictly personal use of the pack(s).\r\nThe
    End-user may not use the fonts, as described on the Web pages of the present Internet
    site: conqueror.com and/or in the Conqueror catalogue, except on work stations
    (computers) and output units (printers) that belong directly to him in his own
    name.\r\n\r\n#4.6 Prohibition on copying of the typefaces and/or fonts by the
    End-user.\r\nThe End-user is not entitled to copy the fonts, except for his strictly
    personal use, for flashing to a third party and for protecting their original
    media (backup copies). The End-user shall ensure that no third party copies the
    fonts covered by the present, nor makes any other use of them than the one defined
    and covered by Clause #4 of this contract. The End-user declares and acknowledges
    that any use he may make of the typefaces and/or fonts which does not comply with
    the terms stipulated in the present contract shall render him liable de facto.\r\n\r\n#4.7
    Prohibition on transfer of this licence by the End-user.\r\nThe End-user is strictly
    forbidden to transfer this licence in any manner whatsoever. Sub-licensing is
    formally prohibited.\r\n\r\n#5. INCURRING LEGAL LIABILITY AND BREACH OF CONTRACT.\r\nAny
    breach by the End-user of any of the provisions stated above in #4 of the present
    contract shall de facto incur the legal liability of the End-user and entitle
    Typofonderie to claim damages. In the event of any breach of the clauses of this
    contract by the End-user, Typofonderie, represented by Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez,
    reserves the right to terminate the present licensing contract without prior notice
    and without financial compensation or compensation of any other nature. In such
    a case, the End-user shall return the digital data to Typofonderie, represented
    by Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez. In such a case, the End-user shall undertake to destroy
    all copies in his possession within seven (7) days of said termination, whereby
    any further use following termination is prohibited. The End-user undertakes to
    communicate to any of its employees or other persons potentially having access
    to the typefaces and/or fonts as described above all of the clauses and conditions
    set forth in the present contract. The End-user declares and shall ensure that
    any of its employees and/or other persons potentially having access to the typefaces
    shall execute the present in proper and due form.\r\n\r\n#6. HYPOTHETICAL MISUSE
    OF THE TYPEFACES AND/OR FONTS.\r\nNeither Typofonderie nor Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez
    shall be held legally liable for any damage or losses caused or borne by the End-user
    and/or any third party resulting from misuse of the typefaces and/or fonts in
    question.\r\n\r\n#7. APPLICABLE LAW AND ASSIGNMENT OF JURISDICTION.\r\nThe present
    contract is governed by, and shall be interpreted according to, French law. In
    the absence of an amicable settlement, any dispute that may arise due to the existence,
    signing, validity, interpretation and/or execution of the present contract shall
    be submitted to the competent jurisdictions of the Paris courts (75).\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthorization
