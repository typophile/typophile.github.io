body: 'so, i&#39;m writing a short article &#40;1000 word&#41; on typography &amp;
  architecture to be read by a bunch of building archaeologists.  <BR> <BR>any ideas?
  or essential reading? <BR> <BR>still thinking about it, but it will probably summarise/categorise
  types of lettering found on buildings &#40;mainly but not exclusively on exterior
  elevations&#41;. some categories that spring to mind are: inscriptions, grafitti,
  directional signage, advertisements etc. have i left any out? <BR> <BR>it&#39;ll
  be from an archaeological perspective, so, for example, an inscription could be
  used to date the building in question, either by content &#40;eg a &#39;datestone&#39;&#41;
  or even style of the lettering <BR> <BR>has this has been done before, in a previous
  article, or is there any point in doing a little piece along these lines? <BR> <BR>cheers,
  geraint <BR>  <BR>'

    <BR>For the 20th century, check out Kenneth Frampton&#39;s book. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;
    has this has been done before, in a previous article, <BR> <BR>Probably yes &#40;I&#39;m
    just guessing&#41;... you should check local architecture schools and their libraries.
    Look for academic researches on this subject, or similar subjects &#40;history
    of architecture, history of arts&#41;. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62; is there any point
    in doing a little piece along these lines? <BR> <BR>It&#39;s an interesting theme.
    I suppose every detail is important in archaeology. <BR>'

  body: And The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, and I believe the Armani headquarters
    in Milano. <BR> <BR>However, it was Pentagram that chose DTLs Nobel for the signage
    and such for the building in Fort Worth. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t comment on the interaction
    of text with Ando&#39;s work in other contexts. <BR> <BR>I would, however, suggest
    a visit to any of his buildings.

    has created custom typefaces based on historical sources for use in New York&#39;s
    Lever House, and Radio City Music Hall. Plus, Gotham was inspired by New York
    City building signage in general, specifically a sign in the Port Authority Bus
    Terminal. They gave an interesting lecture on these projects at Typo Berlin in
    May. You could probably contact them for more information. They know everything.

  body: 'A lot of the Las Vegas signage has a pretty well documented history via a
    company called Ad Arts in California as well as the YESCO archives may have some
    insight to the designers of such signs. <BR> <BR>There is a sign graveyard in
    Las Vegas I went to a few years ago and they are planning on building a complete
    sign museum to house these restored signs. A few Google searches will find you
    there . . . <BR> <BR>Beyond that, almost ALL of the Googie signage designs in
    LA came from the architectual firm of Armet and Davis. A lot of the sign designs
    came from the orthographic drawings presented to clients by the firm. <BR> <BR>Beyond
    that, check out any books from Alan Hess who is an architectual historian as well
    as getting in touch with the LA ModCom who focus on architectual preservation
    for more deep scoop and limitless information. <BR> <BR>Beyond that, check out
    the Letterheads, Sign Muesum in Cincinnatti, and old copies of sign magazines
    on eBay. <BR> <BR>You may be surprised to learn how much influence &#39;pre-fab&#39;
    plastic injection molded lettering had as materials became cheaper and easier
    to mass produce and were marketed heavily to the sign making trade. <BR> <BR>Hope
    this offers some direction . . . <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Stuart :D <BR> <BR>PS: I just
    re-read your initial post and would also suggest you take a perspective on how
    the lettering was integrated into the building vs. just slapped on the front.
    Armet and Davis used different shaped pylons to compliment the lettering.'

  body: 'You might consider artefacts left or trapped in a building. <BR> <BR>Books,
    of course. In a kitchen or storehouse, packaging. Many larger buildings had stables,
    workshops, laundries and bakeries, and kitchens that contained chemicals used
    for making medicine and cleaning. So look for lettering printed on containers
    like flour sacks, canisters and bottles. An old wine cellar with a few bottles
    of 18th century Chateau Rothschild would be a nice find for an archaeologist.
    I wonder what the label would look like. <BR> <BR>I have discovered old cardboard
    boxes &#40;printed&#41; used as insulation. <BR> <BR>Also, various artefacts &#40;some
    left by construction workers&#41; in walls and under floors, such as newspapers,
    cigarette tins, cans, and bottles. Tins for commercial products &#40;especially
    tobacco&#41; are often reused for storage of small items in workshops. Usually
    in the basement/cellar. <BR> <BR>Electrical, gas, heating, plumbing and sanitary
    equipment may have the maker&#39;s ID on it. '

    i&#39;ve seen many weird &amp; wonderful lettered objects when doing building
    surveys. &#40;i&#39;m tempted to post some photos!&#41; all of which are beautiful

  body: 'here is a great example. <BR> <BR>At the base of the Anglo Saxon tower of
    St Mary le Wigford Church in Lincoln is a reused Roman tombstone. <BR> <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/42124.jpg" alt="ertig"> <BR>
    <BR>The orignal, Roman, incription is in the lower part of the tablet. It has
    been broken down, presumably to fit its new location. I don&#39;t have a transcription
    to hand, but the inscription marked the graves of Sacer, a Roman from Gaul, his
    wife Cassouna and their son Quintus.  <BR> <BR>It was reused in this C11 building,
    with an added inscription to Ertig, who donated money for the building of the
    church. The translation reads &#39;Eirtig had me built and endowed to the glory
    of Christ and St Mary&#39;. <BR> <BR>Significantly, rather than obliterate the
    Roman inscription, or use the back of the tombstone, the Anglo-Saxon one has been
    carved in the apex of the tombstone. <BR> <BR>more images can be seen here: <BR><a
