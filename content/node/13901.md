body: "Maybe my question has been asked somewhere else already, but search not beign
  available yet...\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a way, either from Fontlab or from a script
  (maybe robofog?) to have a list of all the glyph combinations possible. Lets say
  an output to a txt file.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I'm currently working on a 620 glyphs
  font and would like to quickly check out all the possible miss matches in the metrics
  and kerning. I've used the KernKing by Mr Cabarga but I've yet many more glyphs
  that are not covered in there.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    check every <em>possible</em> combination of letters. With 620 glyphs you have
    more than 380000 possible pairs; it's just too much to handle."

    I've got so far was on typographe.com/forum, by JF Porchez, \u201Cdo a 'listing
    manually' of all the pairs (aba, aca, ...) in the font, then check them all\u201D.\r\n\r\nLonger
    but more rigorous. Just wish this long list could be generated automatically...

    discover the frequency of pairs.\r\nthe funny thing is the pair of characters
