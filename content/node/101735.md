body: "I'm checking the kerning of an OT font that I thought was close to finished.
  Everything looked to be working well in Illustrator and InDesign except the OX and
  ox combination don't kern. XO and xo combinations kern in. But OX and ox don't.
  I just realized the same thing happens with the small caps.\r\n\r\nI can't figure
  out why. The OT features compile no problem. The Kerning Assistance Tool finds no
  errors. It all looks good in the Metrics windows. All the OAO, OVO and OYO combinations
  work properly. The X glyphs are just about the only glyphs not part of any kerning
  class in this font. The O is part of the C class on the left and the D class on
  the right. The o is part of the c class on the left and the b class on the right.\r\n\r\nI'm
  not sure what to do to fix it. Does it make sense to put the X into a class by itself?
  With just the one glyph in the class?"

    BESIDES the <strong>kern</strong> feature? For some odd reason, <em>some</em>
    programs don't recognize the <strong>kern</strong> feature if there's not at least
    one other feature (such as <strong>liga</strong>) present. Go figure\u2026"

    body: "Nick ~ Yes, this thing has 16 features and 2 stylistic sets. But I remember
      having that one kern feature problem when I first started using FontLab. Was
      there an issue with where the kern feature appeared in the feature list? Right
      now kern is third after locl and aalt.\r\n\r\nI am only having this kern problem
      with all the Xs in the font. And only on the left side. Weird, huh?"

  body: "Nick, as I remember, it was some Adobe products -- CS2, maybe? -- that had
    this issue. Basically, the program checked for gsub tables, and if it didn't find
    any, rather than moving on to look for gpos tables, it just said \"Oh, there aren't
    any ...\" All you needed was one gsub routine to get kerning to work.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Mr. Woodard's problem, I'd bet he'll find it somewhere in the class kerning
    setup. With FontLab, I'd try opening up the font (not vfb), write off the \"features\"
    file, put a kerning exception line in the kern table (before the class kerns)
    and read it back in, compile, generate the font, and test. If the kern now works,
    that little test confirms there is an issue with the class kerning setup.\r\n\r\nFWIW\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    And I guess make sure there isn't an\r\n\r\npos X O o; (or really low value)\r\n\r\nas
    an exception already in the file..."

  body: "Thanks, but I can't say I follow Charles' suggestions. I am not sure what
    a \"kerning exception line\" is or how to put it in or how to write off the features
    from the otf file. Sometimes FontLab makes me really miss my old Fontographer.\r\n\r\nThe
    OT Kerning Assistance Tool doesn't find any problems with my classes. I have combed
    through them several times to see where I might have messed something up. All
    the rest of the kerning works fine. All I can figure is that it must have something
    to do with the fact that the three X's are the only glyphs not part of a kerning
    class.\r\n\r\nTrying to get it to work, I set up individual kerning classes for
    the X, x and x.smallcap. With just the single glyph in each class. Seems stupid...
    But the X's are kerning fine now -- in all my Adobe apps anyway. I am checking
    to see if this has caused any issues in other apps."
