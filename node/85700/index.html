Branding isn&rsquo;t the glossy surface that makes the organization look nice, but rather a culmination of everything the organization is and communicates.  The font that I would recommend would depend entirely on the brand, and the brand would depend on the identity of the political figure in relation to their audience.  That&rsquo;s my approach at least.</div>

Your response made me think about how underused infographics are used in political campaigns. Given how plugged-in and visual American society is, it seems like infographics would be an invaluable tool of political communication. Yet, I can&rsquo;t recall ever seeing a campaign use anything but lame bar charts.</p>
<p>oldnick;
Yes, I agree - a &ldquo;savvy brand&rdquo; for a politician is what I&rsquo;m interested in exploring. Frankly, I&rsquo;m somewhat surprised by the negative reaction to the word &ldquo;brand&rdquo; in this thread. I took for granted people knew I was talking about an authentic visual representation of political messaging, but it seems most thought I was alluding to a shallow makeover used to manipulate voters. That&rsquo;s not what I meant.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;d say most campaigns are very &lsquo;smart&rsquo; in terms of research, strategy, pr and marketing. They might be doing it for all the wrong reasons, but there is a lot of thinking going on there.</p>
<p>As for infographics, that&rsquo;d hurt most politicians. Information graphics are useful at communicating data. Data is the enemy of the politician&rsquo;s brand as data can be used to counter their beliefs. Most presidential candidates are selling belief systems rather than specific solutions. Why that is is an interesting question and one I don&rsquo;t readily have an answer to other than it&rsquo;s typically easier to brand and sell a &lsquo;feeling&rsquo; more than an actual product feature.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As for the term &lsquo;brand&rsquo; I think most people in marketing/design industries have very mixed feeling about it. The term has been abused greatly to refer to visual marketing when many feel that the real definition of a corporate brand falls more into the public perception camp.</p>
<p>I am of the latter and feel that brands aren&rsquo;t created but rather earned. We can make a visual asset to help represent that brand, but if that brand hasn&rsquo;t been earned, then it&rsquo;s merely lipstick on a pig. Sometimes that works. Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think a lot of businesses use the term &lsquo;rebranding&rsquo; now as a couched way of saying &ldquo;we treat our customers like crap&hellip;let&rsquo;s make a new logo to see if we can fool them a bit longer.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On the subject of typefaces and typography for political campaigns:</p>
<p>Hoefler and Frere-Jones added serifs to Gotham, making a slab-serif version, at the request of the Obama campaign:
<a href="http://www.typography.com/ask/showBlog.php?blogID=261">http://www.typography.com/ask/showBlog.php?blogID=261</a></p>
<p>On the subject of branding as a form of manipulation:</p>
<p>I love typography and design but I hate advertising and commercialism. This probably explains why I mainly design books — and ideally only the interiors at that. In this capacity, design is not really about selling anything, but only providing for a suitable, unobtrusive, and subtly allusive reading experience. At the risk of sounding corny, it is not about making money; it&rsquo;s about making something beautiful. Design can be used, as it often is, to manipulate people in order to make money or spread ideas. I feel that though this is design&rsquo;s most obvious use, it is often a misuse. However, I will gladly design pieces that do exactly this for causes I believe in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Branding,&rdquo; by the way, literally refers to heated metal stamps (brands) that were used to mark cattle and even slaves as belonging to their masters. Brands are deliberately created to cement the identity of their owners into the minds of consumers or the general public. So, to get back to Alaskan&rsquo;s original question, what might interest me is a politician without a brand — one whose identity is strong enough that not every poster has to match in order for people to understand who it is evoking. Of course, this might never work. It does contribute to having a unified group of supporters if the campaign has a strong visual identity. But was Obama&rsquo;s first campaign, which was widely described as effective &ldquo;grass roots&rdquo; marketing, really so grass-roots if the identity was determined on a national level by a single group of designers?</p>
<p>Do campaigns, in other words, need branding? Did George Washington have a &ldquo;brand&rdquo;? Is there a better way of designing in support of politicians than by stamping a logo on everything?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know when campaign materials first started appearing, but they certainly existed in the 1800s. I doubt if there was much branding from the standpoint of typography, though.</p>
<p>But perhaps the content of those materials was even more influential in those days than campaign materials are today, since in those days there was no television, radio or internet, and many people voted without ever seeing or hearing the candidates; they relied mostly on newspaper articles and campaign materials.</p>
