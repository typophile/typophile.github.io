body: "I'm feeling a bit stupid but I can't seem to find a version of Scala that contains
  a true expert collection with which I can make fractions. There seems to be a limited
  set (1/2, 1/4, 3/4) but not the full set of uppers and lowers. I don't really feel
  like buying the Open Type collection since I already have Scala. Am I nuts? I looked
  at Fontshop and myfonts and couldn't find what I want. This will affect whether
  I use this font for a job.\r\n\r\nSeems like a huge oversight.\r\n\r\nI am working
  on a book about the 30s & 40s and originally thought to use either Electra or Joanna,
  but Joanna's italics are gnarly and neither has an expert set. Scala seemed like
  a reasonable update of Joanna until I ran into the fraction problem. I'd welcome
  any other suggestions you folks might have for a similar text face that would be
  appropriate for this era, and has the requisite expert set. Dante?"

    the 1/2, 1/4, 3/4. However, last I heard Kent Lew is doing type design full time,
    so it may well have other fractions now, or you could get them on request.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and Whitman is awesome. "

  body: "That is pretty, thanks for the suggestion. Same problem as Scala or Electra
    tho with the fractions, as William noted. \r\n\r\nI just learned Dwiggins had
    designed Electra, which I guess I should have known. Right now I'm inclined to
    stick with Electra (which I already own) since I have already invested in a display
    font for this project. While Electra doesn't have fractions either it does have
    ligatures, sc, lf/osf, all that stuff."

    sure a full set of numerators and denominators are an expected part of a "standard"
    character set.

  body: "I know that Stephen and I don't always need them, but in this case I'll be
    dealing with fractions down to 1/8 so it's kinda important. A lot of fonts don't
    have the full uppers and lowers but at least have a broader selection of fractions.
    I'm used to the old school where H is 1/2, G is 1/4, I is 3/4, J is 1/8 etc, as
    in Bembo, Adobe Garamond, Centaur etc. I do think that a comprehensive text face
    should have at least that.\r\n\r\nAs I'm sure I've mentioned before I work mostly
    on art books and cookbooks where fractions are really necessary.\r\n\r\nChaparral
    is nice but no go with the fractions either... Still leaning towards Electra and
    creating fractions using style sheets but that is a pain. But at least Electra
    has LF which make much cleaner fractions than osf."

    on a perusal on my 1990 copy of Scala, which doesn't even have the limited set
    of three composite fractions; the caps font has no fraction slash, but its basic
    slash goes below the baseline, so could be used.\r\nAnother alternative would
    be to use Scala with the fractions from a different typeface."

    have something like Fontlab or Typetool, and the inclination.\r\n\r\nOh, and what
    happened to Dante in your considerations?\r\n\r\nAnd, as long as we're ranging
    farther and farther afield, could Fournier work?"

    version but it is not yet ready for primetime. Opentype will certainly make your
    life easier since you tend to do books needing the full range of typgraphic features.
    Quark 6 does not do it though.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I'll just second the idea of Dante. A wonderful roman <em>and</em> italic
    [it felt very weird here to italicise the \"and\" and not the \"italic\"!] that
    I have used with pleasure for past books.\r\n\r\nPatty, this may be a completely
    crazy workaround to propose, but what if you have a small, second doc that remains
    open, parked on the pasteboard near your cookbook, and in it you have made all
    your needed fractions from boldface lining figures, reduced to the correct size,
    proper baseline shifts, your more leaning-over solidus between the two numerals,
    and a customized amount of tracking between all three elements. Then whenever
    you need, say \"1/4 t.\" you just go over, highlight and copy, then paste into
    the main document, and go on with what you were doing. Is that too fussy? That
    way you could use Electra or Dante or whatever you want, and you'd end up with
    fractions that have the numeral size/spacing/color that you most desire. (I find
    sometimes that the pre-made fractions and nut fractions are not as handsome or
    readable as ones I can make myself, just as the bullets that ship with many traditional
    text fonts are about <strong>twice</strong> as big as I want them to be, forcing
    me to reduce point size and do a baseline shift in order to use them. Grrrrr.)\r\n\r\nI'm
    still using Quark 6.5 as my main app, but already own InDesign CS2 and expect
    to teach myself that rather than moving up to Q7 if I can avoid buying it."

  body: "Bruce, yes, I've done that with the fractions too. But more often I make
    style sheets for the uppers and lowers. I frequently make them bolder than the
    text font to make up for the smaller size. There can be kerning problems tho.\r\n\r\nI
    think I gotta plunk down for both Q7 and CS3. Yikes. There goes the MacBookPro
    I wanted."
