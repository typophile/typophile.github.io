  logo concepts]]\r\n\r\nI'm working on logo concepts for a financial institution.
  The logo is for a forum /program  hosted by this bank\r\nthat is focused on financial
  wealth management for 20-30 year olds. These are high net worth individuals,\r\n\r\nThe
  client requested that the logo look \"current\" and \"cutting edge\" and that it
  have some appeal to this age bracket. That said, this is a very conservative banking
  institution . such a request has to be taken in context.\r\n\r\nConcept A is about
  taking MICR characters out of context. These are transit and routing symbols found
  on checks. I thought it might be interesting to take these symbols-- which are very
  old school banking, and give them a new spin.\r\n\r\nConcept B is supposed to be
  a visual metaphor for next generation, i.e., the budding of young from parent.\r\n\r\nConcept
  C is supposed to be pretty abstract, and refers somewhat  obliquely to  building
  \ blocks, at the same time the pattern of blocks connect  an \"N\", or an \"X\",
  or a right-pointing arrowhead\r\n\r\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.
  This, as all projects seems to have a deadline of yesterday.\r\n\r\n"

    You could make it work by using MICR type and losing the lighting gimmick\u2014which
    makes little sense when working with a concept rooted in two-dimensions\u2014but
    the generation you want does not use checks often enough\u2014if ever\u2014to
    get it.\r\n\r\nB is too abstract, and the text treatment is too complicated and
    distracting to work as a logo.\r\n\r\nC could work, but the mark needs tweaking.
    Dropping the rightmost block will make the wall  concept more obvious, and the
    perspective needs to be toned down, right now it appears to be curving the mark.\r\n\r\nI
    also think that you should not be breaking up \u201CNext Generation\u201D typographically.
    It makes little sense from a grammatic perspective, and visually it looks overwrought."

  body: Thank you James. All makes perfect sense. I wonder now, about Concept C, whether
    the perspective really adds or should it be removed altogether? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/NGW_2_4551.jpg]

  body: I'm not wild for the checkerboard. It reminds me of the Purina logo, not building
    blocks. I preferred the lower version of A. The rectangles looked like computer
    keys to me rather than MICR characters (especially with the * in one) Which works
    for that generation especially in the glowing Mac blue. If you do decide to stick
    with the checkerboard play more with the type, even try angeling the baseline
    to parallel the base of the squares. Right now the negative space wedge is uninspired.
    Good suggestion by James not to break next generation, that was really distracting
    on your original post.

  body: Thanks so much for the feedback. I was concerned about the Purina correlation,
    it is quite similar. I tried extending the shapes so they're more literally like
    bricks. Still trying to figure out how I can make the type a bit more dynamic..

  body: The two versions drawn in perspective have more interest to me than the flat
    two. Right now your brick wall over powers the text. I'd like to see the type
    have more presence to it. Play with scale and try some other fonts.

    to top-right line, making the image slightly reminiscent of growth on a time chart.

  body: I think that you took the width of the blocks a little too far and putting
    the text in perspective makes the whole thing lest interesting. I also think you
    can keep the blocks in a single shade, at least until the details are worked out.
    Something else to consider is using a very soft lens blur effect to enhance the
    perspective with less distortion.

  body: "it feels extremely basic. rather than messing with two planes, one plane
    being the mark and the other being the text as in the latest version, why not
    working the two planes into the 'bricks'? the type feels weird, wrong and out
    of perspective in the latest. what if that type had to stand on it's own in a
    certain instance? i think being skewed takes all the focus off the strength of
    the mark and places it on some tricknology. i'm not a huge fan of that typeface
    either. especially in this instance. the shapes don't match up, don't make sense
    and don't really say 20-30 years old to me at all; it looks obvious that the designer
    and the target audience are not on the same page. \r\n\r\nthank about patterns
    too. could this mark be used in patterns for later applications? could you duplicate
    it and have it work as a fill? what would that look like? explore you possibilities.
    it will help define the outcome\r\n\r\nw|m"

  body: I prefer the other brick pattern (the one w/ six), I think, and the colors
    produce too high a contrast now. As green and black symbolize economic success,
    try looking at shades of dark green and black.

  body: Frankly, all of these look uninspired.  I think you should steal a cue from
    Barack Obama's branding - young and fresh can be indicated through type alone.  Do
    you need a logomark at all?

    feedback for where I am right now... Trying my best to respond to some of the
    suggestions, too simple, distracting perspective, wrong type, etc... I also think
    I will not work in color until I get the basic idea going. cheers, and much thanks
    to you all.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NGW_5_6510.jpg]

    you're on to something. And that call out chevron is brilliant. Suggests movement

    of tabs in FF, each with \"Next Generation Wealth\" previewed in a different font.

    only with one cube, to simplify that version as much as possible. The attached
    is the result of experimenting with the various shapes and their fills. \r\n\r\nThe
    type I'm struggling with. The chevron's weight, as one of you suggested, demands
    something to stand up to it. Do any of these seem like they are heading in the
    right direction?  \r\n\r\nCheers, and thanks again.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NGW_5_6570.jpg]"

  body: "In most of these, the logomark looks like an empty cardboard box - not a
    sign of wealth or stability!  In the ones on the bottom, it looks like a forward
    arrow with a backward arrow - a sign of stagnance or backwards progress.  I think
    you should keep it simple - something like the type in 1 or 4, with a chevron
    weighted to balance it (not so thick).\r\n\r\n---\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/eeblet/\r\nLive

    the chevron would be seen as a symbol of next/forward, and that it is actually
    \"outside of the box\"which is also another nice tie in.\r\n\r\nSo it is interesting
    to hear this comment about an empty box.I'm concerned now.\r\n\r\nDo you think
    this mark is just not working ? Should the mark just be a chevron? I'm worried
    that if that's the case, I am now so far from the original concept of building
    blocks  that the client might raise some concern (this is an internal client,
    and i had to show some early work in progress. She agreed with several of the
    commentors that the dimensional blocks was the direction to pursue).\r\n\r\nOK,
    I'll keep plugging away...."
