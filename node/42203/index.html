<div class=commentbody>That’s pathetic—did they hire the branding firm of the living dead for that boring, trite, dated nonsense? Given the requirements any branding person with half a brain should have just developed the dragon into an avatar and dumped that static mark concept entirely.

That's very likely. But there are also instances where the client is extremely 'nice' and just approves the first thing the design firm walks in with. It is not exactly unknown for branding agencies to recycle options from previous briefs.</div>

Maybe 'cos they're far too busy trying to make it look 'fresh' and 'young' and many other meaningless adjectives than to make it Welsh. I know its not easy to make something modern and yet at the same time retain some historical references, but this is throwaway design.

<div class=commentbody>Bland crap - doesn't say 'City'. It says "I'm a designer who can't be bothered to think of anything, but this idea is in at the moment so I'll do this, so as not to waste any precious brain cells".
Circles in perspective (I'm sure there's a proper name for it) are the new 'arch thing' (I'm sure there was a name for that also).
Why are logotypes designed with built-in obsolescence nowadays? That is going to look so dated very quickly. In fact it will probably look dated by the time I post this comment.

Municipal governments overpaying for crappy design are as bad as those that hold "contests" to get decent work from inexperienced and/or desperate designers for nearly nothing (as San Francisco did for their bus company a decade ago; the "winning" design was never used due to the outcry). Both practices hurt us all in the graphic design community. It's a political and economic issue.</div>

<div class=commentbody>@cuttlefish : yes, i see yr point about being a political issue. which brings me to a topic i've wanted to launch for discussion for some time, but it's loaded, vague, ripe for argument, and my thoughts thus far are rather superficial.
but the recent writer's strike got me thinking about this again :
how is it that composers and writers have a mechanism and several organizations in place to ensure residual payments over extended usage (royalties, etc) but graphic designers and illustrators don't ?
there are exceptions - character design, font design licenses, deals detailing subsequent media, etc., but in general it seems that the graphic artists get the shortest stick. i've commissioned music for animated graphics which i've produced and the composers still get royalties everytime it plays. i got a flat fee, end of story.
any thoughts ? new thread ?</div>

Because neither designers nor their clients want to deal with the headaches involved in tracking logo use and calculating royalty payments. Because designers don’t want to get a tiny payout up front and only really collect over time.

in the case of music the tracking isn't done by the artists and direct (account) clients, it's done by a combination of dedicated tracking systems including broadcasters (usage) and publishers (payments).
>>Because designers don’t want to get a tiny payout up front

who said anything about a tiny payout up front ? the musicians i've worked with get serious fees upfront as well as residuals.

<div class=commentbody>I remember when the BBC launched Torchwood, all the guff in the interviews with writers and stars was about how it was more adult than Doctor Who, how by being broadcast later in the evening it could deal with more mature themes. The irony of all this is that there is nothing in Torchwood that begins to approach the emotional depth developed in the first two seasons of the new Doctor Who. </div>

<div class=commentbody>For the record I did not say Torchwood was cool. I said that the logo undermines BBC's efforts to make Cardiff cool.
I personally think Torchwood is silly, but the show makes Cardiff appear* infinitely cooler than it really is.

Too late! It is as in the novel Ratner's Star: we are already inside the black hole, and that is why such things can *appear* perfectly normal. The laws of physics as we know them have already broken down.
The moment we began discussing Cardiff and typography the curvature turned negative.</div>

Yes that is indeed a very nice tourism logo. Much more thoughtful looking, at the very least, but also pleasant.
It even makes a nice page background and border.

I agree. The stuff Warren Ellis would write about a Welsh rebellion might be funny enough to put me into the hospital.

<div class=commentbody>Wow. Just wow. What a shame. What dreck.
That said. I have known my fair share of clients that get all excited by the "logo-ey-ness" of things.. I think, at least as far as logos are concerned, that is the cause of the phenomenon where the client ALWAYS chooses your last place option as their favorite. It's usually the most generic, logo-ey looking thing on there. Granted, these clients are mostly small businesses that either had no logo, or an amateur one and they're just dying to look "professional." Seeing their name in a way that they associate with other larger companies just gets them going. It takes awhile for that to wear off then they usually start wishing they had a really unique brand that makes them stand out instead of one that just makes them feel better.
But this is a city?? A city with rich tradition and a long history. Not a hip startup. The mind is boggled.
Kudos to the designers for convincing someone to give them $45k for that. As it's been said before, it will only make it harder for me to convince someone they should pay for the time required for a really strong, unique, smart identity.</div>

Actually, hold on. If you want it you can have it for jut $10k. Look what Wales paid for theirs, this is a real deal!
I'll even take off the stickynote for free.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've had Avant Garde Demi for 20 years, and it still works like it ever did. IIRC, it was one of the Laserwriter fonts.
Maybe ITC Garamond will come back into fashion too.

<div class=commentbody>@Nick "and it still works like it ever did."
Could you imagine if digital fonts had an internal counter, and as you used them more and more, they started to flatten, bend, and break? Eventually you'd have to buy them once more to get them all sharp and crisp.
And if you forgot to convert it to outlines, you couldn't use those fonts at all until the printer sent your file back.
That could get pretty inconvenient.
e: I see this isn't a new concept at all and there are distorted fonts that adjust slightly. Still not quite the same as a font that actually wears out though. Maybe via a plugin then?
