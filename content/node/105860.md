  help at this point! \r\nIndeed, I've been re-thinking the letterspacings and all
  seems to me in a mess now\u2026! \r\nThe typeface is a display one, only for fun
  : mixing pixel 80's-style and Textura Blackletter, a weird thing! :) \r\nIn the
  first version of the letterspacings, I made it to be legible but now, I find it
  interesting to use it more in a tight letterspacing, in a way to be more alike with
  a revival of the historic calligraphic form. But of course, it is less legible,
  if it's not to say almost \"not-legible\", like the old Bibles though\u2026\r\nWant
  do you think of it? Do you have any advice? \r\nThank you in advance for your return!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Test_4020.jpg]\r\n\r\nExemple
  of the historic design:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mainz_187_detail_sm_6358.jpg]"
