body: "I'm designing my first typeface, I was hoping to get some constructive criticism.
  I call it Pateo, I'm aiming for a staple sans-serif kind of design, something similar
  to Helvetica, Akzidenz Grotesk, Univers and the like. I know its a lot to live up
  to, but I plan on having many, many drafts. This is my lowercase.\r\n\r\nHave at'er

  body: "Hi Calvin, I've been down this road, with some discouragement from others
    as to it's value as a project, but I learned some good lessons, albeit the tough
    way. I think that it's almost best that you continue without advice because I
    think you're probably close to learning some important things by yourself. It
    sounds like you could hack iteration since you anticipate many revisions.\r\n\r\nBegin
    a couple more typefaces and you will be able to move your knowledge from one to
    the other, eureka moments in your other designs will highlight problems across
    the board. I became too focussed on my first design and it really stalled my progress,
    one font later and everything looks different.\r\n\r\nIf this advice seems fairly
    mystic, apologies. Perhaps this advice is really terrible, I'm tired but it seems
    like the right thing to say."

  body: The junctions where curves meet straight strokes  are too heavy  have a look
    at ITC Johnson to see how heavier than normal junctions can be rendered
