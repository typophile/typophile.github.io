    I don\u2019t think that approach is appropriate for medical technology, which
    could benefit from a responsible blue-chip feel that says \u201COur stuff won\u2019t
    kill patients.\u201D These letters also don\u2019t connect with the style of art
    in the ellipse/doctor, and the colors you\u2019ve chosen feel very dull."

  body: "Can the oval shape be tweaked at all? It seems extreme/awkward. The new font
    is very modern but the image of the doctor looks dated.\r\n\r\nThe icon and the
    type are too disjointed items with no real relationship. A first obvious step
    would be to put Berkeley in the same color as the oval, however I think this may
    need a little more work than just that. Also on your second posting the colors
    are too close in tone/value. It's fine to keep them in the same blue-green family
    but at first glance they look the same. Or perhaps it's just my screen, on your
    earlier posting they had more contrast.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'd make the ellipse more round and make \"the doctor\" bolder. Lines are
    very thin whick is not that good for small reproduction or vinyl.\r\n\r\nHave
    you tried different shapes? Like circle?\r\n\r\nIf you're goging to use a circle
    you may consider slanting your type for about 5\xB0 to make some dynamism. I think
    your type may be appropriate but I'd shorten extenders. Maybe not on the L, but
    definitely on Y.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: "The unicase/lower case mix of the new typeface is peculiar, some of the glyphs
    don\u2019t appear to be designed to be together. The B sits well with the e and
    r but not with the K, l or y. I share the same misgivings about the \u201Ctechno\u201D-quality
    of the type, for the reasons that it is already dated by some standards and will
    not age well. The relationship between icon and type isn\u2019t working yet, they
    just aren\u2019t tied together whether this can be sorted is a tricky problem
    since you have two strong directions \u2013 horizontal and diagonal, this is especially
    evident in the centred versions. The next area to look at is the sub, you have
    a long line to work with and used at a small size (business card for example)
    it might be just too small to read easily, but as noted the lines in the icon
    will also need consideration if they aren\u2019t going to fill in at small size
    \u2013 so, given that it cannot be altered, that minimum safe size is going to
    dictate, to some extent, the form of the logo.\r\n\r\nThe website has that web
    2.0 emboss, highlight effect that some web designers feel free to throw at every
    carefully designed (or not) logo \u2013 not pertinent to your project, just something
    that really annoys me, especially when I am forced to comply with poorly constructed
    guidelines.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t see the sexism in the icon, it doesn\u2019t seem
    to have a specific gender, maybe that\u2019s just me.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Yes - I agree with Paul that the doctor image is sexist. It is clearly a
    man. Why would you specify either male or female in a logo that represents an
    entire company? \r\n\r\nMake that case to whomever you're designing for, and they'll
    let you change it for sure. It is DEFINITELY sexist. Anyone who argues otherwise
    may not be worth working for. "

    crazy.\r\n\r\nTo help you understand ... perhaps sexist is too strong a word,
    maybe \"gender bias\" is better.\r\n\r\nit's for a training centre - where (presumably)
    both genders will attend to advance their careers in medicine - I think it odd
    to include an image of either gender as the visual icon/identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

  body: "Yes - perhaps \"sexist\" is not the right word. I was just making an observation
    that the image, at first glance appears more masculine than feminine. Careful
    design can be used to make an image like this truly gender-neutral, but in this
    case, it might still need a little bit of tweaking. If it solicited this strong
    of a reaction in me, it might do the same for others.\r\n\r\nIn any case, all
    I was saying that it was one other thing to consider besides the type."

  body: "It's that lowercase r that is really bugging the hell out of me. I don't
    mind this typeface since you it does an effective job at making the point that
    this is a medical technology company, but there is that huge white space under
    that r, specifically in the first logo, that is just making my eye not want to
    look at it anymore. \r\n\r\nI think tying the oval doctor logo (which is also
    awful, but since you can't change it I'll skip my rant) in more with the Tagline
    or the company name would definitely give this logo a much tighter and precise
    looking quality. Maybe try something other than a completely linear looking logo,
    make the oval work for you, rather work for it. \r\n\r\nGood luck!"
