    a magazine masthead this would work, but as a logo it\u2019s WAY too intense."

  body: If you keep the heavy type, have you thought of giving the ampersand a different
    color? Maybe a shade of gray? Although basically, I agree with James when he says
    that it's way too black and heavy. Maybe you just need to come up with some alternatives.
