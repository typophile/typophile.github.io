    Put \u201C\u2018Lucida Grande\u2019, \u2018Lucida Sans\u2019 in your css."

  body: "I think the problem might be related to the font being rendered using different
    rasterizers. In your web browser you're seeing the font rendered using your machine's
    ntaive rasterizer (OSX or Win), but Photoshop is using it's own internal rasterizer.
    \r\nLucida Grande is a well hinted TrueType font, and it looks to me like you're
    seeing the hints being interpreted differently (or on a Mac, seeing the results
    of downsampling.) In particular, note in your example how the ascenders are 1
    pixel taller than the caps in the HTML version, but the ascenders align with Caps
    in your version. This could be a result of hints being applied differently.\r\n\r\nIn
    that case, you won't be able to get the exact same image in your browser as in
    Photoshop even if the fonts are exactly the same, but they should be close.\r\n\r\nJason "

  body: "I would agree with Jason that the difference you see is due to the rasterizer.
    Lucida Grande will look different still when viewed in a Windows or Linux browser,
    due to the different rendering engines on those systems.\r\n\r\nYou can only count
    on \"Lucida Grande\" being installed on Mac OS X systems, since it's the main
    UI font and I don't think you could delete it even if you wanted to. But Lucida
    Grande is just a newer version of Lucida Sans with an incredibly large character
    set. There is a similar version of Lucida Sans included with Windows 2000/XP called
    \"Lucida Sans Unicode.\" Finally, the basic Lucida Sans ships with Microsoft Office
    products and thus can commonly be found on many Windows and Mac systems. It also
    has a true italic, which Lucida Grande and Lucida Sans Unicode lack.\r\n\r\nThe
    most interesting thing about the three different versions is that while their
    common glyphs share mostly identical outlines, each one is hinted differently,
    giving it a noticeably different look when rendered at smaller sizes (at least
    under Windows).\r\n\r\nSo, for cross-platform rendering on a website, you might
    write your style definition like this:\r\n\r\n<code>font-family: 'Lucida Grande',
    'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n"

  body: I don't know if this helps but Photoshop 7 and above has a "System Layout"
    option on the Character palette, which according to Help "lets you preview text
    using the operating system's default text handling." For the old Win2k machine
    I'm on here, this means no anti-aliasing at all...

    body: "That's it ! \r\nI had heavy troubles whith photoshop' rendering for kerning,
      specially with Lucida Grande, on Win XP (without \"clear\" type). \r\nMy web
      pages mockups were confuse and quite dirty. That option (Character palette's
      \"System Layout\") solved the problem. Thanks for the help."
