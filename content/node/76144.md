  body: Using the same spacing for both slab and sans doesn't work. The slab is far
    too tight and many slab glyphs require different sidebearings.

  body: The top serif on Zz doesn't make sense to me. Drop it from the sans version
    at least. Even in the slab, I sort of get it for the lowercase z, but for capital
    Z it seems a normal one that hangs down would be far more practical.
