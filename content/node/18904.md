  2003\r\n\r\nFF Folk is a font based on Ben Shahn\u2019s lettering used in his paintings
  and lithographs. The Ben Shahn Folk Alphabet was originally created as lettering
  in 1940 and reconstructed and redesigned by Maurizio Osti and Jane Patterson in
  1995 with the consent and approval of Mrs. Bernarda Shahn and the Estate of Ben
  Shahn under license from VAGA (New York). Shahn originally drew his alphabet taking
  inspiration from vernacular shapes -- a \u201Clettering for the illiterate\u201D
  -- and he called it \u201Cfolk alphabet\u201D. He felt that letters and words should
  have the same importance as images and drawings, and he combined them in his work.
  \r\n\r\nMaurizio Osti has designed a family of fonts. He recreated two character
  shapes for each letter (one for the uppercase keymap position and one for the lowercase
  keymap position) that best capture the vibrant variety present in the original art.
  It is therefore possible to compose text by combining uppercase and lowercase interchangeably
  (UPPERCASE ONLY, lowercase only, and UpPeR aNd LoWeRcAsE) to achieve a more personally
  artistic effect. Folk Regular is inspired by \u2018Bring back our Sons from far\u2019
  (gouache and gold leaf; 40 x 26 inches); Folk Rough by the graphic work \u2018Immortal
  Words\u2019 1958 (Silk screen in black, 15 x 20 inches). Folk Light and Folk Rough
  Light have been drawn to complete the family. \r\n\r\nBen Shahn was born in Kovno,
  Lithuania in 1898, and moved to the United States in 1906. He died in 1969. At an
  early age he developed a passion for lettering, and while a lithographer, he developed
  a great understanding of this artistic discipline.\r\n\r\n<strong><b>External Links</b></strong>\r\n<a
