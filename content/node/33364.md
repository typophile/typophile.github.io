  for a class I'm taking.\r\n\r\nIt is inspired by Frutiger. My idea was to add an
  arc to the ascenders and an opposite arc to the descenders to create a sense of
  movement. I've felt that sometimes sans serifs are too static and could use a little
  excitement. \r\n\r\nI appreciate any constructive criticism you can offer.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDoug"

    <a href=\"http://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=87\">Dalliance</a>.\r\n\r\n2. It's considered
    unethical to use the outlines of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/myriad_pro_regular/&sample_text=sans%20arc&sample_size=110\">another
    font</a> to create your own.\r\n\r\nI think you have some interesting ideas with
    the stroke endings, but you need to build your typeface from scratch."

  body: "To me it looks like Frutiger created on a bad press. I like the little flashes
    but don't think they're suitable on a font like this. Frutiger was designed for
    legibility - Charles de Gaulle Airport I think (I suspect Stephen will have more
    idea than me) Hence it was never intended as a font with \"movement\". My personal
    opinion is that it is deathly dull, but we suffer from a total overload of it
    in the UK and I'm using it on a particularly uninspring project at the moment
    so I'm a little biased. It is however very successful at it's job (without opening
    up the legibility debate AGA!N)\r\n\r\nI think you need a more suitable typeface
    to \"inspire\" your idea."

  body: "It's no fun being discouraging to a student, but I would advise running away
    from this as fast as you can. Besides the ethical issues, the main thing is this
    type of effort is boring as hell. :-/  Yes, look at existing fonts, but make your
    own forms from your own head - that's what makes it interesting.\r\n\r\nThat said
    you have a very good point concerning the static nature of most sans designs (including
    Frutiger). When you're making your forms from scratch try sheared/concave terminals
    but also experiment with a slight slant.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I apologize for assuming, but even if you created the outlines from scratch
    they are much too close to Myriad, the font I linked in my post. Your details
    will be much more successful if your bones are original.

    \r\n\r\nI wish that I could believe that, but looking specifically at the original
    forms of such glyphs as @ & * in Myriad, it becomes very clear that the outlines
    from Myriad were simply appended with little \"flicks\". (And this site was probably
    the absolute worst place to post your \"first face\". Folks here tend to be pretty
    protective when it comes to type design.)\r\n\r\nSince you stressed that you were
    looking for \"constructive criticism\", please allow me to offer this: Construct

    hard to see this because alot of type does look suspiciously alike to a newbie.
    A new serif can seem like it should 'count' - I mean what's the difference? Trust

    operation kitten calendar. With what you said on my mind I saw the above, hats
    and all, and just started cracking up.
