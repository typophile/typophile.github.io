  starters, the forum will host discussions about FontLab and Photofont products as
  well as about products from Microsoft Typography (Font Validator, VOLT, WEFT). \r\n\r\nBut
  we have also added a few other forums focused on specific issues with font development
  (e.g. hinting, OpenType feature development) and with type design. \r\n\r\nIt is
  not our plan to hijack Typophile of course, just offer a place for discussions that
  is specifically geared towards font editing applications and workflows.  \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
