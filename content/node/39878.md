  here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.decodeunicode.org/en/U+5143\r\n\r\nAnd I wondered if it would
  be prudent to add to the set of major currencies that my monospaced programmer's
  font supports. But maybe there is a reason why this isn't standard- (yet?). Maybe
  there is a latin abreviation that's used. Maybe because the Yuan doesn't float in
  currency trading it isn't relevant. Or maybe it's time we all added the Yuan symbol!\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I was wondering what you were referring to when I saw the topic. Well, \u5143
    (U+5143) <em>is</em> a symbol for the yuan, but it is not a currency symbol in
    the vein of $, \u20AC, or \xA3. It is a Chinese ideograph.\r\n\r\nI guess because
    of the nature of the Chinese writing system, many Chinese characters can be used
    in a way they can be considered symbols, and in the case of \u5143, it functions
    as a currency symbol. But keep in mind that many single Chinese characters stand
    for single words, and \u5143 standing for 'yuan' is a typical example of that.
    I don't have one at hand, but I'd think that Chinese dictionaries would include
    \u5143 as a character, whereas for example $ would not be considered a part of
    even an extended latin alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe character \u5143 is an interesting
    one though, because it bears little resemblance to the traditional character for
    'yuan' is \u5713 (the character for 'circular object'), or in the Mainland simplification,
    \u5706. It is an \xFCbersimplified, informal character that must have been invented
    to avoid writing ten strokes or more for every mention of yuan in shop signs.\r\n\r\nAs
    displayed prominently on Japanese bank notes, the Japanese yen--which shares the
    character etymology of \u5713 with yuan--uses a similarly simplified character
    \u5186.\r\n\r\nSo to answer your question, I'm not sure \u5143 (or \u5186) would
    be suitable for a monospace font, or indeed any font not supporting any other
    Chinese characters. Also, in \"monospace\" fonts supporting Chinese characters,
    the Chinese characters usually take up double the space of the usual monospace
    glyphs, and it might be jarring to see a \"half-width\" form of a Chinese character.
    Still, you're welcome to experiment.\r\n\r\nThe currency symbol for yuan is \xA5,
    which it shares with the yen. As used for the yuan, \xA5 can have either one or
    two crossbars; as I remember, two bars are preferred for the yen."

  body: "Nick, maybe that's bang on. Especially from the point of view of proper emphasis.
    But... two things:\r\n\r\n- The old glyphs could be used in academic papers/texts.
    Eg \"in 1962 this cost 36 Fr (franks)\"\r\n\r\n- Also if I recall correctly when
    I was in Japan, prices in print usually did have the symbol. And I imagine that
    the Yuan would/could be similarly used in print. \r\n\r\nSo maybe we need a Sinophile
    to describe what the current state of affairs is."

  body: "Would get the \xA5 symbol next to a price paid for a business or would they
    simply use the Ideograph ( old or new)? What about in a car advertisement? Would
    that be true in Hong Kong & Bejing? What about in Korea? Singapore? \r\n\r\nUnless
    I am mistaken there are only two code points for the Yuan, the one I brought up
    ( the simplified one ) and the old one Brian mentioned. Does anybody know otherwise?\r\n\r\nWhen
    the Yuan is symbolized using the \xA5 symbol are they just using whatever  \xA5\_they
    have in whatever font they have? That's my guess. "

  body: "First, let me clear up a slight mistake I made. I almost made it sound like
    \u5143 is a variant form of the traditional ideograph for yuan, \u5713. It is
    not. It is a standard ideograph in its own right, of similar pronunciation but
    quite independent origins from \u5713, with the meaning of \"fundamental\" or
    \"element\". Like most Koreans, I don't speak Chinese although I wish I did, and
    barely read some hundreds of Sino-Korean characters, as in knowing their Korean
    pronunciations and having a vague sense of their meanings.\r\n\r\nSo when I was
    in China and saw signs giving prices in the form 100\u5143, I knew that \u5143
    had the sound value of \"won\" in Korean (which corresponds to yuan), and immediately
    realized that it was the ideograph being used for yuan. Though I should have known
    better and in fact had a vague idea of what had happened, until I looked it up
    just now, I didn't know for sure that the Mainland Chinese just adopted a simpler
    ideograph with the same sound as the symbol for the currency yuan.\r\n\r\nI've
    visited China three times for a total of around three months. I've never been
    to Hong Kong, and only briefly visited Singapore too long ago to have any memory
    of the Chinese price signs there. So I only have fleeting impressions of how yuan
    is written in China.\r\n\r\nAs I recall, in printed signs and price tags, both
    the forms \xA5100 and 100\u5143 are used. In department stores, I recall the form
    \xA5100 being used more often, but don't quote me on that. In handwritten signs,
    the form 100\u5143 seems to predominate. I might have seen other permutations
    like 100 RMB where RMB stands for the Mainland currency <em>renminbi</em>. When
    the context is clear, the numbers alone may be used to indicate a price. I've
    never seen the traditional ideograph \u5713 or its simplified variant \u5706 used
    to indicate price in Mainland China. Bear in mind though that I've only seen signs
    and tags, not what's used in books or magazines for example. So there's the possibility
    that the traditional ideograph is reserved for more formal, literary uses.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Unicode code points, \u5713 is U+5713 and \u5706 is U+5706, both different
    from U+5143 for \u5143. Unicode encodes traditional and simplified Chinese characters
    separately.\r\n\r\nI also found <a href=\"http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/currency_symbols.html\">this
    page</a> which lists \u570E (U+570E) and \u571C (U+571C) as variants of the same
    ideograph. The page also describes the traditional ideograph \u5713 as the currency
    symbol used in Hong Kong and Taiwan (I've been to neither).\r\n\r\nSo what about
    the Korean won? The Korean dictionary I looked up has separate entries for \"won\",
    the currency currently in use, and for \"won\", the historical currency before
    the currency reform of February 1954 when the <em>hwan</em> replaced the won.
    The difference? The latter is written as \u5713 in <em>hanja</em>, the Chinese
    characters used for Korean; the former is not written in <em>hanja</em>. Won is
    ultimately a cognate of yuan and yen, but I guess the public and/or the powers
    that be decided that any sense of the etymological origin of the word (\"round
    object\") has been lost by now and has been entirely replaced with the sense of
    \"unit of currency\".\r\n\r\nSo legally and properly, the (current) Korean won
    has no Chinese ideograph equivalent. However, \"won\" is a short enough, monosyllabic
    name that the Korean alphabet spelling \uC6D0 is used in most price signs and
    tags, as in 5000\uC6D0. The same price may also be listed as \u20A95000 in print
    or more rarely in handwriting (\u20A9 is the currency symbol for the won).\r\n\r\nI
    think word order might be an important reason why the currency is \"written out\"
    rather than indicated by the currency symbol; we say \"one hundred dollars\",
    which is better reflected in writing \"100 dollars\" rather than \"$100\". Whereas
    in English, writing out \"dollars\" is unwieldy compared to just writing \"$\",
    in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (as well as Thai, I might add), \"writing out\"
    the names for the currency is less cumbersome and so makes using currency symbols
    like \xA5 and \u20A9 less pressing alternatives."
