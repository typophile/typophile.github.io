  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s getting warmer and warmer, and my stock of Tees needs to be refreshed.
  So, I was thinking of making some funny typ-o-shirts myself, silkscreening them
  and wearing them proudly. <BR> <BR>I was looking for some funny one-phrase jokes,
  but couldn&#39;t find anything practical. The &#34;seems-once-it-was-funny&#34;
  link at <a href="http://www.eyewire.com/magazine/features/bumperstuck/index.htm">EyeWire</a>
  is not working properly - as if all the images except for the only one were deleted
  or something... <BR> <BR>Can anyone help me with some jokes? Eh? :D'

    <BR> <BR>That&#39;s because when Agfa bought the guts of the EyeWire site from
    Getty Images and ran their stupid little page spider over it, they neglected to
    capture images that were referenced in JavaScript or in file subdirectories. I
    should know where stuff is, because I built that site. Now it&#39;s nothing more
    than a shell of it&#39;s former self. Hey Agfa! Ever heard of a link-checker?
    Yeesh. <BR> <BR>However, I did happen to archive that very page on my own site.
