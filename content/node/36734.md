  image quality, but it's all I have.  I thought it was Century Gothic, but the \"M\"
  and \"u\" don't look right.  I need to know the font and when it was first introduced.
  \ This is my first attempt at this, so if I did something wrong, just let me know
  how to correct it.  Thanks."

  body: I'd rather think this is ITC Avant Garde Gothic. According to FontBook it
    was released in 1970.
