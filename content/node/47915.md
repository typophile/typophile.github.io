  body: There is no standard character set for an OpenType Pro font. Fonts vary by
    foundry and the number of glyphs in an OpenType font can reach 10s of thousands,
    especially when you include non-latin chracters. Is there a specific kind of language
    support you are interested in?

    that are e.g in the fontfont opentype pro version - Central European, Baltic,
    Turk and Latin 3 - for some reason the charts in fontfont userguide are rasterized.\r\n\r\nAll
    the pdf i've been able to find at various foundries are also locked or rasterized
    -\r\n\r\nIm not trying to steal fonts - just a list of all characters in the \"western\"
    language"

  body: "I'm pretty sure Adobe's glyph complement PDFs are not locked to prevent copy/paste.
    You can go to the Adobe web store, find the specific family, and there's a downloadable
    PDF right there.\r\n\r\nFor example, http://store1.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/1737.pdf\r\n\r\nI've
    been working on rationalizing and extending Adobe's various extended Latin character
    sets, and will be publishing some \"final draft\" specs later this month on my
    \ blog, for review and comment.\r\n\r\nIn Adobe's nomenclature, a western font
    with \"Pro\" in the name does have a certain minimum language coverage. See: http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/info/charsets.html\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Henrik specified 'all the characters ... that can be copy/pasted into a indesign
    document', which suggests he wants characters (encoded text entities) only, not
    all glyphs.
