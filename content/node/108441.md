  in a process of designing a typeface - <a href=\"http://dribbble.com/goloub/projects/177343-TT-Nord
  \">TT Nord</a>. It's not the final design by that link. Anyway, what bothers me
  is that I've drawn many glyphs, including Cyrillic extended and Latin extended a
  and b and others. Is there any way to know what languages does my font support?
  Maybe a script or some kind of a web service? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance?"

  body: I don't know of any automatic way to do it. Your face supplies the glyphs
    for scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc), of which various subsets are used to write
    various languages. It would be nice to know that language Foo uses all of SomeBlock
    except Bar, with the addition of Baz and Qux from AnotherBlock. That would make
    it easy to say, "My font provides full support for language Foo", which it going
    to be more relevant to most people than saying, "My font provides full support
    for the Latin script". This information may be partially compiled somewhere (e.g.
    "Latin alphabets" on the English Wikipedia), but it's a manual verification process.

  body: "There is no such tool. I did a wide research about languages and alphabets
    between 2010 and 2013 for my own font project. Unhappily, no source is complete.
    If you have interest, here are some good information and sources:\r\n\r\nThe Wikipedia
    article about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-derived_alphabet|Latin-derived
    alphabets]] is the nearest single source I know. For deeper information, you can
    take a look on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A|each letter]] and language article
    published in Wikipedia. Each letter article brings a table with diacritical combinations.\r\n\r\nA
    good place regarding Latin script is [[http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html|this
    post]] from Adobe's Typblography. You may also find useful [[http://diacritics.typo.cz/|this
    site about diacritics]].\r\n\r\nRegarding transliterations, there is an [[http://transliteration.eki.ee/index.html|excellent
    archive]] made by Thomas Pedersen. It's almost hidden in the Estonian Language
    Institute site.\r\n\r\nYou can also consider to do the contrary: define which
    languages you want to support and then include the proper characters. Unicode
    blocks are heterogeneous and the Latin ones brings together glyphs needed to less
    common European languages besides Asian languages, Medieval characters and even
    Roman signs.\r\n\r\nFor example: Latin Extended Additional includes 1E9E, the
    German uppercase double S. It seems ok to include that. In the same block you
    find the Vietnamese accented and double-accented vowels. Of course, you would
    ignore them if Vietnamese support is out of your target. This Unicode block also
    adds several precomposed combinations to support Indic, Hebrew and Cyrillic transliterations.
    Again, you must choose if transliterations would be supported.\r\n\r\nA similar
    definition must be made about Phonetic alphabets, currency and letterlike symbols.
    This will take some research, but you will not include unnecessary glyphs.\r\n\r\nSome
    additional data about Unicode blocks:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\nLatin B has mostly
    glyphs to African languages, but also mix rarely used European glyphs and Pinyin
    transliteration.\r\n</li><li>\r\nLatin C brings glyphs to Cyrillic transliterations
    and old African orthographies. 2C6D and 2C70 are needed to complete African support,
    the remaining probably are out of your scope.\r\n</li><li>\r\nLatin D has many
    Medieval additions and support for old orthographies. Probably the whole block
    is unnecessary to you.\r\n</li><li>\r\nLatin Additional is a mess. Define the
    languages and look in detail this block.\r\n</li><li>\r\nIPA and Phonetic block.
    Just needed to phonetic support.\r\n</li><li>\r\nSuper and subscripts. Add the
    whole block if you want to keep up to date with contemporary type trend.\r\n</li><li>\r\nCurrencies.
    The very basic set is: dollar, cent, pound, yen, currency (generic) and euro.
    An improved set also includes thai, c\xF3lon, naira, won, new sheqel, kruvinia
    (hryvnia), tenge, new rupee (20B9) and tugrik. Most of others are historical.\r\n</li><li>\r\nLetterlike.
    n\xBA, liter, estimated, TM, and Ohm are basic. Others may be included or not
    according to your scope, but are not essential.\r\n</li><li>\r\nPunctuation. Basic:
    2002, 2003, 2013, 2014, 2018 to 2022, 2026, 2027, 2032, 2033, 2039, 203A, and
    2044.\r\n</li></ol>\r\nHere in Typophile you will find a number of quite informative
    threads. Some:\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/67458]]\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/84563]]\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/77983]]\r\n\r\nThe

    of languages you cover is impressive.\r\n\r\nHowever your code for French (my
    mother tongue) does not appear to match what I read on your blog. If the characters
    listed in <code>subsetting-codepoints</code> are considered as accessory, then
    you have put there characters that are so frequently used in French that they
    are on the French azerty keyboard as well as the Canadian French keyboard, namely
    \xE7\xE8\xE0\xF9\xE9 (for the others you need to use a dead key); they are certainly
    not accessory.\r\n\r\nThe French alphabet is very clearly listed on the German
    Wiki <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz\xF6sisches_Alphabet\">Franz\xF6sisches
    Alphabet</a> as well as the French Wiki <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_fran\xE7ais\">Alphabet
    fran\xE7ais</a>, where characters specific to French (to be added to what you
    call \"English\") are listed separately.\r\n\r\nSo, the small characters needed
    to be in the font to contain the French alphabet (and my understanding is that
    they should appear in <code>scanning-codepoints</code> similarly to what was done
    for Portuguese) are (using intervals)\r\n<pre>\r\n0x00E0,0x00E2,0x00E6-0x00EB,0x00EE,0x00EF,\r\n0x00F4,0x00F9,0x00FB,0x00FC,0x00FF,0x0153\r\n</pre>\r\nThe

    the scanning code points of English are inherited.\r\n\r\nMichel"

    characters including 65 from Russian.\r\nWhy not just list the 43 new characters

    Cyrillic as parent; 8 of the 9 characters you list in the scanning-codepoints

    the languages Tajik, TalyshCyrillic, TurkmenCyrillic, Tuvan, Udmurt you have Cyrillic
    as parent-name; the attribute \"parent-name\" is used nowhere else. Was that intended?
    Maybe parent should have been Russian (or Cyrillic)?\r\n\r\nThe scanning codepoints
