  body: Posting the same font eleven times is not going to get a quicker answer; in
    fact, the result is apt to be quite the opposite. Ill manners are seldom rewarded.

  body: "I think from the simultaneous posting times he was another victim of the
    duplicate posting bug. http://typophile.com/node/80571\r\n\r\nWhat is the source
    of this? Is it a film or tv credit? It has a late '60s, early '70s sci-fi look,
    however from the wikipedia entry on David Koechner's career it is not going to
    be earlier than mid '90s."

    was playing up and didn't realise it had processed this often!\r\nThe jpeg is
    from the end credits of the film 'Paul'. \r\n\r\nLook forward to any suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nVera"
