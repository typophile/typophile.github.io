		<div class="commentbody">I don't think they should have aligned the D and the n &ndash; it causes problems with the visual hierarchy. The eye follows the n down instead of reading the rest of the word. They should have focused on even spacing on the line in which &quot;Daily Care&quot; falls. It look heavy and poorly balanced. Too many people focus on the seemingly obvious alignments when there are far more important alignments to be watched. Kyle, I'm not picking on you, I'm just remembering some past things of which you reminded me. <BR> <BR>Just my two cents. It is a little late to critique, but you guys seems to have so much fun critiquing work that is finished. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

I doubt that you're impressed by all the stuff that <a href="http://www.landor.com/">these guys</a> do (who aren't in-housers). <BR> <BR>While I appreciate the sentiment that some people have no respect or sensibility, I don't think that the test is whether you work inside the place or outside of it. Some of us struggle daily  trying to make the best of a bad thing left behind by people who weren't in house. And I am positive the opposite is the case as well. <BR> <BR>I am not impressed by this revision, in-house or not. Although I have no idea who did it, or what the design brief was (assuming there was one), I don't like the result. The puffy letters look like a certain <a href="http://www.cheerios.com/about/honeynut.asp">cereal</a>, and kind of have a non-identifiable and indistinct harmless feel. At least the type in the original felt somehow reassuringly technical or clinically effective (It appears to be Avant Garde&hellip;anyone?). <BR> <BR>I question whether making something kind of mundane and me-too is what you really want do do when competing in the personal care market. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&lt;font class=&quot;dontLookLikeCrap&quot;&gt;Jon, my remark was a big generalization, but from my point of view its often true.  <BR> <BR>The new breed designer that gets hired in-house for minimum wage is given a computer for &quot;tools&quot; and a copy of photoshop for dummies. Often enough they get reshuffled from the communications dept once some manager discovers that John Doe created that smashing powerpoint with rotating globes. I've met plenty of them who now carry the title &quot;graphic designer&quot; on their biz card. <BR> <BR>However there are a few in-house designers, such as yourself I'm sure that do have the education to back the position.  <BR> <BR>One has to admit that their numbers are dwindling in favor of those candidates who meet job requirements which include 30 different software programs for 20K a year. <BR> <BR>The corporation is lucky that you can fix things nicely but sadly uneducated about your job and design in general if they are hiring these outside agencies responsible for gradient crap. <BR> <BR>In all, Its just hard to beleive that any respectable design firm would allow gradient tricks and plug-ins out the door to any client, committee or not. And who does that leave? students, beginners, and the cost-saving in-housers. I'm not trying to be elitist believe me, just pragmatic. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I'm starting to think that these larger design firms are hiring the same dime a dozen. Or perhaps there's some new school of thought that justifies gradients that no one knows about? <BR> <BR>See its just very scary to see! If more and more large co.'s are getting 3-D'ed then its gonna be very hard to explain to our next clients why its bad and why these large co.'s are doing it wrong. <BR>-t <BR>&lt;/font&gt;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tanya, I agree largely with what you say. Especially about the the smashing powerpoint. I have also just seen a job posting for a graphic designer for my city government cleverly disguised a clerical opening for a rate significantly smaller than what they pay me and requiring more technical knowledge in print and online work than I have with 7 years of experience. <BR> <BR>I DO undertand what you are witnessing. I just don't think that the inside/outside dichotomy is really the thing. <BR> <BR><i>Or perhaps there's some new school of thought that justifies gradients that no one knows about? </i> <BR> <BR>&lt;speculation&gt; Maybe a confluence of production technology with inadequate designers? I wonder if better techniques in printing, painting whatever, make things like gradients more doable and more tempting?&lt;/speculation&gt; <BR> <BR><i>I'm not trying to be elitist believe me, just pragmatic.</i> <BR> <BR>I wonder if it's not more pragmatic to think that <b>any operation</b>(inside or outside) will hire cheaper if they know they can sell the work. <BR> <BR>I don't think you're being elitist. I just think that the inside/outside dichotomy is false. <BR> <BR><i>hard to explain to our next clients why its bad and why these large co.'s are doing it wrong.</i> <BR> <BR>I know this is hard for those who really care about visual communication.
