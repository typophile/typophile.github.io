  body: "In Unicode, it's called PLACE OF INTEREST SIGN (U+2318). If you're using
    a Mac, you can find it in loads of fonts including Lucida Grande; if you're using
    Windows, you can find it in Arial Unicode.\r\n\r\nOn a Mac, you can insert it
    using the character palette (under Technical Symbols). I don't know how you'd
    insert it on Windows."
