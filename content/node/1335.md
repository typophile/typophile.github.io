  body: 'Many variations have been explored with the client. Discussions with the
    architect directed me to create a visual identity that left a sense of &#34;creative
    formality&#34;. By good fortune the name allowed for the beauty of the f-f-i ligature.
    The italic &#39;i&#39; was chosen as a solution because of the interesting tension
    it created.  Is the italic looking too forced? Is it the correct weight? Here&#39;s
    an earlier study: <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1651.jpg"
    ALT="cioffi2.jpg"> <BR> <BR>The Mercury caps have two characteristics I like in
    this composition. The slab serif on the &#39;I&#39; and the spur on the &#39;C&#39;.  The
    earlier study here uses Futura. Do you think that is a better choice?    <BR>
    <BR>Thanks.'

  body: ' One weakness in your earlier version -- the lc &#39;io&#39; also read as
    &#39;10&#39;. -- Futura is better &#40;although I know some of you are tired of
    it.&#41; --  &#39;ARCHITECT&#39; seems to have no reason for ending at the point
    underneath the &#39;o&#39;, is it centered of the &#39;o&#39;? it isn&#39;t that
    i dislike it, it is only that is calls more attention to the &#39;Cio&#39;, or
    rather it almost causes the words &#39;cio&#39; and &#39;offi&#39; to appear?
    maybe this is not a negative thing. The word &#39;cioffi&#39;, is this a last
    name or does it have other meanings or connotations? '

    Make sure you also give it  <BR>a look at small &#40;sub-1&#34;&#41; sizes. &#34;Architect&#34;

  body: ' Looking at the first image you&#39;ve posted, I still think that this sans
    is calling too much attention to itself. You have the elegance of the serif &#40;Mrs.
    Eaves?&#41; and then your sans is almost ... it is almost anti-design? It almost
    looks like a mono-space sans, again to me it looks this way. -- I do like this
    sans, but perhaps for other situtations. -- I&#39;m also not so sure about the
    greying down of the word itself. -- ;&#41; How about Anisette Petite? -- One more
    thought. The placement of the word &#39;ARCHITECT&#39;. Correct me if I&#39;m
    wrong, but the architect&#39;s job starts with a solid foundation, no? '
