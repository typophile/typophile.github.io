<div class=commentbody>What is it saying? <br> <br>I think you should emphasize the smirk (in size but not curvature), and maybe you can use it to break the monotony of the bounding box. <br> <br>BTW, do you mind that it reminds of MacOS, and a legionnaire? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant- The face is also a combination of two letterforms, the T and the Y (the T being stacked over the Y). After creating it, I did think of the Mac Os logo. I don't particularly care for that logo. I always find myself looking for a hidden meaning in the Mac Os logo that I never find. <br> <br>Scott- I wasn't thinking of this as a mark/icon in place of type, but as a combination of both. I haven't tried many fluid/organic versions, but perhaps there would be some possibilities there. One of the reasons that it is currently so geometric is because I have often heard that a good logo should fit within a square (for reducing, placement, compactness, etc). But I'm open to ideas. <br> <br>Thanks for the comments.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I meant Roman legionnaire.

<div class=commentbody>Scott- I came across the "square theory" in my undergrad program. My professor for Corporate Identity said that often times logos have to fit within a square for their applications (corner of letterhead, homepage, business card, t-shirt pocket.) I don't believe, and I don't think my professor believed that this was a hard fast rule, but that it was a starting place, and to venture out meant you had a good reason. Another way I have often heard this idea described is that "a good logo should be able to roll down hill". So anything that fits nicely into a square, like a circle, would roll (probably much better than a square). I think the main purpose of this kind of thinking was to encourage designers to consider the application limitations of a logo that has extreme horizontal or vertical dimensions. But yeah, how boring would it be if all logos were square? </div>

<div class=commentbody>There's certaintly a practical advatange to having a logo with close vertical/horizontal dimensions - but if anything that says "circle" to me. Plus it seems to me that this consideration is secondary to other things in a good logo, like memorability, which is not square at all. I think as long as one avoids extreme lopsidedness of dimensions, it's fine. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Ty. <br> <br>Could you perhaps show a sampling of logos that you have done? It would help us get a sense of your style. What kind of clients/employers are you reaching out to? <br> <br>I say all this because I don't particularly like this direction. Cute. Clever. But in my opinion missing the mark (as it were). My gut feeling is that this is one of those concept directions that looks so promising... but in the end is just about a smirking face. My suggestion would be to stow this idea for a bit, and try other things. <br> <br>If you want to go with this direction, this will improve legibility (though changes the personality </div>

<div class=commentbody>Randy - After seeing a few of my logos, do you think that this direction is appropriate? <br> <br>One of the reasons I have been hesitant to break the box shape is because I think that's what makes it simple -- a twist on a simple geometric shape. <br> <br>I'm open to comments.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ty: <br>I think your original idea looks cool. Also good in the blue version you have above (although I don't think it works as well in reverse). <br> <br>I like its simplicity and playfulness. I noticed both the "TY" letters and the face immediately, but if some people don't right away, I think that's okay too. <br> <br>It also seems like it lends itself to embellishments for the sake of self-promo pieces in the future (I'm reminded of the old constantly changing MTV logo). <br> <br>It seems sly without being silly/goofy. <br> <br>The world is so annoyingly serious that it's nice to see something with a little wit.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Ty, <br> <br>Thanks for posting the logos. They are nice, particularly Lucky 7 and Quote 66. After comparison, your mark does seem to be *on the money* with regards to your style, though I think possibly not as strong as the two mentioned above, but stronger than the 3rd example. <br> <br>Many people here have responded positively, so don't let me discourage you. As I said, not my favorite logo, but what you do with it now will speak volumes also: type choice, stationary layout etc. <br> <br>I just had an idea: what if you were to design your idenity around the concept of identity. You could make the top of your letterhead into a government form with a box for your thumbprint (actually print each one), lines for your name and info (hand write it in), etc. There would certainly be room for wit in a gov't form! Same for business card & envelope. If you didn't want to fill in by hand, you could type them (ahhhhh. with an actual typewriter). If you are like me, you probably won't go through huge amounts of stationary so the crafty approach could save cash. This would certainly be memorable if it came across my desk. Just a thought to consider. <br> <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>Speaking of identity, have you considered my question? It's a great idea well-executed, making your name into a face, but it gives me a strong expectation of what you ought to look like if I were to meet you (as your clients surely will). If you're skinny with a narrow nose and arched brows, people may say, "Oh, sorry to disturb you, I was looking for Ty, is he here?" It's a flexible enough concept to be re-proportioned into a caricature assuming it isn't one already. Perhaps you could show us a photo?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks everyone for the positive responses to the "one on the right". I'm actually still somewhat torn between that one and the original (with a thicker lined smirk). The typography and face read better in the most recent one, but somehow a square seems more profound in its simplicity. I keep thinking about what Troy said about the original one: "It also seems like it lends itself to embellishments for the sake of self-promo pieces in the future (I'm reminded of the old constantly changing MTV logo)." Is the new one as versatile for applications and embellishments? </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Ty. <br> <br>About the previous design (the orange one you posted): It doesn't have the same personality. You were right to move on. <br> <br>I'm in agreement with the others. The curved bottom is better than the original, both facially and typographicly.

<div class=commentbody>>Is there a wave of educators teaching >that "Marks are for corporations", not >individuals or small businesses. I <br>As I was quoted as someone with that opinion, I'm not sure if there is any official school of thought along those lines. But logograms were invented for large corporations and historically stem from royal/clerical heraldic signs... I just don't feel that a small shop or a single individual NEEDS a visual sign, which to me -- like any kind of corporate identity -- is a bit military and krypto-fascistic (Hitler being the guy who went Corporate Identity on a nation-wide-basis first and still stands as an example what CD/CI should NOT be about), <br> <br>I jus think this is a none-to-thought-through approach when it comes to small companies or even individuals. With a logogram you're imitating the visual langugae of large corporations (which NEED such signs to be recognizable internationally, especially as they lack a really individual face-to-face-communication, thus opting for the next best thing, virtual comminucation). <br> <br>Now, an individual or small shop doesn't need that, as they still Do communicate personally. Faking a corporate ID is simply amounting to DE-humanizing what is ideally something much more and much better than any CD McDonalds or Nike can EVER come up with... so this, imo, is contraproductive to what I try to do: create a personality. A large companie need a CD to establish a virtual identity recognizable to customers and workers... but does a small bakery need that? I don't think so. <br> <br>And as I'm effing tired of the overkill-overload of logos and imagery and pseudo-corporate-designs and all-too-clever-ideas for every boy and his dog, I absurdly find myself in a anti-design position, trying to talk my clients OUT of all this clever designery stuff, opting for a simpler, more 50s-ish solution of a good typeface, good paper and all that :-D. </div>

<div class=commentbody>very interesting HD. I might agree, almost. <br> <br>In any case...the one on the right reminds me of the decepticons or autobots logo..y'no from the Transformers. <br> <br>So, I'll be the odd-ball and say I prefer the solid square.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The second logo (in my previous post today) had too thin of a far right vertical line. In this post, all of the line weights are equal except for the vertical lines in the nose and the smirk. So, basically I have thickened the outside line from my December 17th post. Tanya, do you get the Decepticon vibe from this one? Randy, what do you think about the line weights now? <br> <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23093.jpg alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Ty <br> <br>I hate to be the problem child but I like your original mark better than this new version. <br>Your first mark had a nice edgy, mischievous vibe, whereas the new one seems kind of bland and vanilla by comparison. <br> <br>I also like the compositional power of the face-in-a-square you had originally. There is a nice kind of tension that is created by a composition like this that is so obviously simple geometric shapes but at the same time is completely recognizable as another thing -- in this case a face (and your name). The geometric simplicity -- making it all work in a simple square -- adds a layer of surprise, like seeing a magic trick pulled off successfully. The "Hello Kitty" logo is like that: it's just a few circles, but you can't look at it without seeing a cat. <br> <br>Possible idea for the future: if you go with the flat-bottomed version #1, you could have three-dimentional blocks made by a woodcutter and they could sit on your desk either in the "face" configuration (like your logo), or you could separate them and sit them next to each other so they are recognizable only as letters. What the hell, you could have these made and give them away as a promo (someday). The interactive logo. <br> <br>Anyhow, that's my long-winded two cents. <br> <br>Troy</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ty, just because I have alot of printing experience. Don't waste your money creating a curved diecut for your business card. It be one thing if it were a card for a corporation, but for an individual it is cost prohibitive. Good design is design within your limitations, try creating the curves using ink and leave the card as a rectangle or a square.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Ty <br>My idea for the blocks was more like what Scott is describing, with the letter shapes cut out of two sides (I guess you could say the front and back). If you have the shapes cut out of all four sides (like you've illustrated), it presents a problem of how to make the negative space above the y's tail (the face's "mouth"). But one option to doing it the way you've illustrated is that you could paint each side a different color, so the corresponding t and y of the same color could be aligned on the same side, the unity of which would emphasize the "face," or you could line up a t and y of different colors, which would make more obvious the letterforms. <br>I'm not sure if I'm making myself clear, it's kind of hard to describe in words. <br> <br>Any of the logo versions you have will look cool. Also I really like the card design. <br> <br>Troy</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I was getting my materials together to enter my logo in the Graphis design annual, and on the form they asked for the "title" of my logo. While perhaps not the most significant issue to my self identity, I thought a clever title could be another way to demonstrate my creativity. After initially thinking of "Ty - Self Idenity", "Ty - Face (Self Identity)" etc, I realized that it was really important to me that the judges recognize that my logo is not only a face, but a T and a Y as well. So then the idea dawned on me to call the logo "TYpeFACE". This is one word that contains all three words that I want to communicate: "Ty", "face" & "typeface". What do you think? <br> <br>The font is a modification of House Gothic Extended Bold 2. I haven't purchased the font yet, so this is actually just an Illustrator rendering based off their websites' LetterSetter display. If I decide I like the font enough to use it, I will purchase it. <br> <br>I've also posted 2 examples of providing a "caption" for my logo. I don't know if this is necessarily a good idea; I like the logo by itself. But, for contest submissions and other times when I have to give the logo a "name", maybe this would be good. I have in in grayscale because I'm still undecided on color. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24204.jpg alt> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24205.jpg alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>That may be *too* clever for the judges. I think <br>one of the nice aspects of the mark is that it <br>can take a few seconds before you see both <br>aspects of it (the name and the face). <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Don't jinx it by making it more complicated. The type would need a lot more modification before it started to really work, and even then it would still distract from the mark, possibly even making it <i>less</i> likely that the viewer will study it long enough to see both aspects.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree. I'd recommend just titling it Typeface. The payoff for the clever judge(s) will make it even better. Without any visual tricks, the name has multiple levels that reveal themselves progressively.</div>

<div class=commentbody>wow. cool idea ty. <br> <br>have you tried a quick and dirty prototype on scratch paper? my industrial design background tells me that you might be in for a surprise when you try to fold it as shown here. <br> <br>it may be possible with some creative scoring, cutting, and folding, but i don't think it's going to work as you have visualized here. <br> <br>for example, the Y will not hide behind the T, as shown. (in other words, something that would hide behind your T would be another mirrored T, that would create an H when unfolded). <br> <br>play around in the material world, if that is where the end product will live. good luck.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Great idea! I'd make the fold go up, though: more neutral in terms of culture and left/right-handedness, more evocative of opening eyes or removing a helmet, more compact, plus the hinge will last longer. You could even pretend it's a cell phone and hold it up to your ear to get a direct line to Ty for some emergency design help! ;-) <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, I first envisioned this card as you described. My reservations were that a) it looked kind of like I was putting my nose up in the air (arrogance), and b) when the card was open you just get some information, a Y and a strange shape. <br> <br>When the most previous post came to mind I was (and still am) concerned about the hinge, but I thought the pay off would be that it reads as TY from left to right when it is open. <br> <br>Does anyone have suggestions for types of paper or other materials to use when attempting this kind of hinge? </div>

<div class=commentbody>What if you hinged the Y instead, <br>since that would have a larger <br>'hinge area'. The Y would flip <br>out to the right, so you'd still <br>read TY diagonally. <br> <br>Or...maybe mirror the entire card <br>like a booklet. On the front, print <br>the full TY. Inside, print the T <br>on one side, the Y on the other. <br>That'd give you a really strong <br>hinge and a more 'even' shape once <br>opened (plus a potentially cheaper <br>die). <br> <br>I think it's a great idea. Definitely <br>look into getting a die...it may <br>be a lot less than you think. The <br>tricky part is going to be getting <br>it to register accurately. <br> <br>Also, just my opinion, the blue isn't <br>working with the red. Red and Blue <br>next too each other create a bit <br>of dissonance. <br> <br></div>

My gameplan is to work in this order: logo>typeface>business card>letterhead>envelope>website>send out resumes <br> <br>Until then, thanks everybody for your advice on my self identity. This critique has helped me see perspectives I wouldn't have otherwise seen. Some thanks: <br> <br>Darrel: Your recent suggestions on the card are very insightful. I am going to use one of those ideas, and when I decide I will post it. <br> <br>Daniel: Thanks for the help on the card.

(I warn you though, the site is kind of slow). <br> <br>Dylan: I especially heed your advice because of seeing your work on LogoLounge and your site. Your stuff is a bit funkier than mine and I'm inspired by that. I think your a great example of a Designer / Illustrator. Thanks for the suggestion of creating a display font. <br> <br>Hrant & Scott: Thanks for directing this discussion from the beginning. It was your early comments that challenged my attachment to the square. <br> <br>Tim, BJ, Andrew, Troy, Kyle, Santiago, Myke, and Benjamin: Thanks for the positive feedback. I always appreciate harsh honesty, but I want to thank you guys for being willing to encourage a direction you liked. <br> <br>Scott: Yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure how those blocks are going to work now. But I think having the best possible logo should precede random applications (at least now I do). <br> <br>Tiffany, Randy, Daniel, Tanya, HD, BJ, Zato and Kevin: Thanks for raising your concerns.

<div class=commentbody>i'm afraid i stumbled across this one a little too late to be any help. but just from where i sit i'd like to see an arch where the "eyes" are and maybe a curve at the bottom of th eT for a nose mimicing the curve you gave the bottom of the box for a chin. that would get rid of the legionaire effect and shatter any resemblance to the MacOS icon.
