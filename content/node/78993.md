  body: "I think that in this time period (which is pre-digital) they were probably
    using some sort of lettering template for the embroidery machine, or had built
    in lettering that the machine could stitch. I also noticed that there are two
    different styles of A, so possibly a different machine was used for the last sample.\r\n\r\nThe
    first A is rather unusual, and I can't find a font that has the same characteristics
    as these letters. I was hoping maybe to find a digital font based on a typeface
    that may have been the model for this stitching, but I didn't see one, so far.\r\n\r\n-

    kit expert he said that searching for this font had caused him so much grief over
    the years. For me It\u2019s became my personal font holy grail. One day, I may
    find the answer.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nWillie"

    work. Someone may have an old machine, or know about such machines and whether
    they had built-in script styles for monogramming hankies or dress shirts.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Cheers Mike,\r\n\r\nA very talented design friend redrew the three letters
    that I required. Not ideal, but it looks pretty close. Like you suggested I may
    do a bit of research into old embroidery machine fonts from the 60s and 70s.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for all your help.\r\n\r\nWillie"
