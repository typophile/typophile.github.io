  body: This looks to me like they started with Gill Sans Bold, substituted a Futura
    Heavy G, and modified the E to look like the one in Vonnes. They forgot the last
    step in which you redraw it so it doesn't look like a such a mishmash.

  body: Speaking as a graphic designer who once worked for Lions Gate for all of 6

    the people that brought you \"Van Wilder,\" \"Blair Witch 2,\" and other disasterpieces.
    \ Let's just say their employment practices were on a par with some of those fine
    films and leave it at that. I would assume this logo came from their Montreal
    office (the \"original\" LionsGate).  \r\n\r\nHowever, that \"E\" really is very
    80's hair metal. And not in a good way."

      \r\n\r\nIn my brief experience (three months!) in the movie design business
      it seemed that most of the people doing that sort of art came from illustration
      rather than design backgrounds, and weren't particularly sensitive about typography.
      Hence the repetitive use of Trajan, Compacta, etc. for titles -- don't fix what
      ain't broke."

    As someone who does both, I find that a lot of illustrators don't know much about
    type and many designers don't respect illustration. I was trained as a designer
    and a fine artist and I think both fields (design and illustration) are so closely
    related they can stand to learn a thing or two about the other. But alas, this
    is another discussion entirely..."
