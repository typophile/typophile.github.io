body: Hi <BR>I&#39;m using Fontlab 4.6 in MacOsx Panther 10.3.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m generating
  intermediates from light and black weights using multiple master weight axis. When
  I generate the different weights of a font &#40;Light, Book, Medium, Bold, Black&#41;
  it goes ok on the screen. But when I print them, the caps accents of all of them,
  except the Book weight, appear printed by half. Some of the descendents like the
  lower limit of &#34;g&#34; and florin also appear incomplete. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s
  possibly happening? <BR>Thanks.

  body: Maybe try decomposing the characters before generating the fonts &#40;after
    you have generated the instances&#41;. <BR> <BR>Do the characters look okay in
    the instances you generate? <BR> <BR>Also you might try clearing the system font
    cache using <a href="http://versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/22795" target="_blank">Font
    Finagler</a>, for example.
