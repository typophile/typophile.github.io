body: "Hi there folks, looking for some suggestions on a typeface. \r\n \r\nI'm mainly
  a web developer, but trying to up my design skills, especially in the typography
  department.\r\n\r\nAnyway, i'm going to brand a friends horse training company (no
  pun intended) and i'm struggling to find a suitable typeface.\r\n\r\nI'm not necessarily
  looking for definite answers (although suggestions are more than welcome), but some
  guidance on the process of choosing a typeface. \r\n\r\nHere are some words that
  fit with the identity we are aiming to achieve:\r\nEstablished \r\nConfident \r\nWorld
  Class \r\nProfessional \r\nPowerful \r\nExperienced \r\nWinners \r\nModern\r\nPersonal\r\nApproachable\r\nTrustworthy\r\n\r\nThere
  is quite a mixture of feelings there, the reason i'm struggling to choose something
  is because Powerful and Modern suggest to me sans serif whereas Approachable and
  Personal suggest serif. \r\nApologies if my initial thoughts have offended any typogurus,
  like i said &mdash; i'm pretty new to thinking about typography.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance for any help, appreciated. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't know that I'd stay away from the serifs.  Horse breeding, after all,
    is great and venerated tradition.  I think the history of the thing is much more
    difficult to conjure in a sans serif face. \r\n\r\nTake your cues from the animal
    itself.  Have you ever really LOOKED at a racehorse?  Beautifully arched neck,
    long delicate legs, aquiline, expressive head and face... serif, in other words.
    \r\n\r\nSome of the newly designed serifs are indeed strong and Modern.  Go to
    fonthouse.com. They let you test set type up to 288 points.  You can then print
    screen and paste up in Photoshop to get a better  idea of what you're looking
    at before you commit to purchasing a slew of fonts. \r\n\r\nAlso, Google old horse
    racing ads to get an idea of the type styles used during the past century - that
    should give you an idea of how to start \"seeing\" them.\r\n\r\nGood Luck!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    deleted some of your adjectives, that should simplify your intend.\r\nThink \"the

    A more solvable approach.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Since I see in the list\r\n\r\nWorld Class\r\nModern\r\n\r\nI take it that
    your client wishes to avoid using a traditional display font with Western/Cowboy
    associations like Broadgauge or French Clarendon.\r\n\r\nHelvetica (or Futura,
    or Univers) in bold italic comes to mind.\r\n\r\nThere's also a heavy wide sans-serif
    I'm thinking of, but I can't recall the name off the top of my head, although
    Annonce resembles it."

  body: "Thanks for the comments folks, some really useful advice. \r\n\r\nI'll definitely
    have a look at the suggested faces, i'll also keep in mind to look at factors
    such as the shape of horses as suggested by cdunitz. \r\n\r\n\r\nI'll post something
    up for review once i've made some progress. \r\n\r\nThanks everyone. \r\n"
