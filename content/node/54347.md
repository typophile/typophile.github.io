  body: "Looks very cool. But only lc? For a face like this you can get by without
    UC, but numbers especially and some basic punctuation would make a big difference
    in its utility (hence its commercial success). In fact here's an idea: make a
    fuller font, charge even a bit more than \u20AC29 for it, but give away the lc-only
    version for free (to hook people on it, and then they'll be much more likely to
    pay for the full version).\r\n\r\nBTW, can the two styles be layered in any way?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
