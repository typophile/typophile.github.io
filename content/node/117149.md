body: "Pendula\u2122 is an adaptation of Pittorseques Droites (Scenic Casual) found
  in the circa 1924 specimen book of La Fonderie Typographique Francaise. Changes
  to a very small number of the original characters were made to make the typeface
  work better with more languages, as well as for aesthetic reasons. A newly designed
  Cyrillic character set was added to make the design even more useful, enlarging
  the character set from the basic Latin set to over 650 glyphs covering seven languages.
  Pendula\u2122 also includes tabular and proportional number sets plus a bonus set
  of over thirty monetary symbols. Other international symbols were included too.
  It is a wonderfully casual and flexible design, usable in many situations.\r\n\r\nFrom
