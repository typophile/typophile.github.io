body: "Hi Folks,\r\n\r\nThis was from an ID question I was stumped on. The typeface
  is a serif that reminds me of ITC Usherwood, but is different in a number of ways.
  It resembles some of Les Usherwood's other fonts too, but it isn't anything I think
  I have seen before. It is used for navigation and titling on the site for <a href=\"http://www.15cpw.com/\">15
  Central Park West</a>. It shows up on the covers of their Brochures, and inside
  some of them as well. It was from a brochure that I took the attached screenshot.
  \r\n\r\nAnyone recognize it?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n- Mike[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Park15CPW_3933.gif]"

    Frutiger in 1960, but it does not look like this font. This is still a mystery
    unless we can find a font with this name.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "This font is starting to keep me awake. (It's not even 4 AM here.) The small
    full serif on the A seems like one of the most distinctive, and nagging, features
    of this font. It resembles old 19th century typefaces, but I've been through all
    of Jaspert's book, and McGrew's, and the Rookledge Typefinder. I even looked through
    all Goudy's works. The only thing remotely close to the A is Administer/Minister,
    and that's about the only part that resembles this sample.\r\n\r\nThe only thing
    that I can find about 'Opera' on the web is that it's a Norwegian Browser that
    Microsoft was trying to buy.\r\n\r\nI'm going to try to go back to sleep. I hope
    someone can ID this thing, because I can't believe this Real Estate developer
    would have a custom font designed.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    the W in a case like that.\r\n\r\nBy the way, look quite good this font.\r\n\r\nStefan"

    that's a good idea. I had found out that Zeckendorf Marketing was the one who
    prepared the ad campaign, including the printed materials, but I had trouble finding
    a contact to ask about it. My first try at dbox didn't get me to any menu I could
    read -- just nice photographic panoramas, a la the Park views at the 15 CPW site.
    So I have restarted with a new browser to see if I can get farther.\r\n\r\nI'll
    let you know if I learn anything. This one is getting to me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
