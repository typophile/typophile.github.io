body: 'Hi guys, <BR>in the discussion on the iris type, some of you were speaking
  about snap on serifs. I, like probably all of us, made a bitmap face, just for fun
  &#40;bj !!!&#41;.  Then I tried to make an italic to it. Which, theoreticly, is
  not a bitmap anymore... After that I wanted to find out what happens with the font,
  when I  glue serifs on it. Looks funny. I don&#39;t remember in what state of mind
  I was the, because I made Swash capitals as well...... <BR> <BR>Jacques <BR> <BR><!-Attachment:

  body: ' Love the serifs. I&#39;m just mad because you beat  <BR>me to it. I was
    trying to think of ways to make a  <BR>bitmap font feel more &#42;familially tied
    to a  <BR>display face without having to just use the  <BR>bitmap font at 300%.
    Mekka uses a very viable  <BR>approach. <BR> <BR>And the swashes are like buttah.

  body: ' v. nice --- Who this Mari might be is not for me to know, but I think you
    should spend more time with this. I like the serifs the most because they go off
    the beaten path and that &#40;IMO&#41; is a good thing with bitmap design. Design  &#40;again
    IMO&#41; is one place where you can go to the edge and still safely rein yourself
    in for safety. <BR> <BR>The only letter that I notice as odd is the lc italic
    &#39;p&#39; it looks more like an UC italic &#39;R&#39;. Perhaps the serif needs
    to go the other direction? '
