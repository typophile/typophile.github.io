  and the \"M\" characters. I'm afraid that it might be a font that was edited to
  add the swirls...\r\n\r\nSorry the image is a bit blurry. (Actually, the reason
  why I'm looking for the replacement font is because this is the sharpest image I
  can find, and I would like to redo it as a vector image...)\r\n\r\nThanks for your
  suggestions!"
