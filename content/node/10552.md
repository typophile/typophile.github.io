body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>Im trying to recognize many different fonts, but am having
  a lot of diffculty as there are simply so many fonts to search through.  I was thinking
  it would be easier if I knew the actual terms for the different catagories of fonts.
  <BR> <BR>For instance here are 3 that im looking for, all of which have distinct
  features, can anyone help with what catagories they are. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70727.jpg"
  alt="typesoffonts"> <BR> <BR> <BR>A - has a cut/line running thru it. <BR> <BR>B
  - has the edge getting much darker than the center <BR> <BR>C - looks like an &#34;outline&#34;
  type of font, but an inner area is filled in, and there is a tiny gap between the
  inner and the outer bit. <BR> <BR>Any help would be very much appreciated, and thanks
  for reading my message.

  body: Great stuff, thanks so much! <BR> <BR>I had a quick search of fontshop using
    those terms, but didnt have too much luck, are there any other big font-search-engines
    you could recommend ? <BR> <BR>Thanks again.

  body: You should also bear in mind that these effects can be created using a stroke,
    in Illustrator, so even if you have the proper term, you may not find an exact
    match in a search. I&#39;d focus on trying to identify the original font &#40;Futura
    in the first example&#41;. If you need a precise match you might need to apply
    the effects yourself.

  body: Thanks for the tip Patricia, I&#39;ll try that with Futura for A.  Im pretty
    sure C is Symbol MW, so hopefully I&#39;ll be able to add some sort of halo/ringed
    effect to it.  Any ideas for what B might be, the way the 3 is cut and bottom
    of the 5 is cut seems strange, all of the rest seem to fit with a narrowed Swiss921
    BT. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70801.jpg" alt="">

  body: Mister Zee, if your real purpose here is to try to match the fonts for soccer
    jersey numbers, you should know that many of these numbers are custom fonts. Sometimes
    the best you can do is get something similar and then rely on the team colors
    to fool the viewer into thinking it&#39;s the right type style. Most people will
    not know as long as it&#39;s close. I&#39;m not sure if B is custom numbering,
    but I am just saying this so that you don&#39;t assume that all numbers and letters
    are going to be fonts that you can find with a search engine.  <BR> <BR>Knowing
    how to describe the way they were made will not really help find them, as Patricia
    noted.

    - Lex <BR> <BR>P.S. I noticed a common Steve Jackaman theme running through my
    examples. I wonder if he had something to do with the font on the jerseys.
