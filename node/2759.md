body: I have a few questions regarding making a PDF;  <BR>Is there any difference
  in using type 1 or true type when making a PDF in illustrator/indesign? <BR>Do you
  have to include the fonts as separate files? <BR> <BR>Also, it seems like the fonts
  get bolder when I make outlines of them, on the other hand, occasionally the letters
  jump around a little if I don&#39;t make outlines of the fonts.  <BR> <BR>Any help
  would be appreciated. <BR> <BR>Oystein <BR>
