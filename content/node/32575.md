  body: You'd have to ask <a href="http://bertholdtypes.com">Berthold Types</a>, since
    they get <a href="http://typophile.com/node/5063">downright testy</a> about anyone
    messing with their typefaces or font names. I'm guessing it's not been digitized
    or is no longer available.

  body: Ken, there's a lot of history that I won't go into, but try not to dig up
    the dirt here. I just hope no one asks for the thread to be deleted now.

  body: If I remember correctly, it was once available. Is that the one that looks
    like a mutant <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=venus">Venus</a>
    with a very high waist?

    not on the berthold site.\r\n"

  body: I know it was once available as a Berthold digital font, because it's in the
    third edition of [[FontBook]], but I suppose there were some trademark disputes
    because it's no longer available as far as I can see. I'd write Berthold and ask.
    Let us know what they have to say!
