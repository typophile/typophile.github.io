body: "Type designer/printer Russell Marat has launched a Kickstarter fundraising
  effort to have two new type designs engraved and produced in metal by the Dale Guild.
  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2094022925/gremolata-and-cancellaresca-milanese\r\n\r\nThe
  page includes interesting text and videos explaining the project. \r\n\r\nOf most
  interest (both intrinsically, and because it serves to justify the expense of the
  project) was Marat's discussion of how composing foundry type differs from printing
  letterpress with polymer plates (which in the end can look indistinguishable, I
  suppose). He talked about the spontaneity available to the type composer that is
  lost in the plate process."

    we need to have new typefaces.</em>\r\n\r\nWhile Maret may be jaded with legacy
    foundry types, the \u201Cnew\u201D types he proposes conform to an antiquarian
    aesthetic.\r\n\r\nIs that the essential nature of private press practice, the
    best and only way it can maintain a viable niche?\r\n\r\nWould it not be possible
    to address contemporary design issues with a non-retro metal face \u2014 a sans
    serif, for instance?\r\n"

  body: "Excellent questions!\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that this kind of project is
    teetering on the edge of viability as it is, and design decisions that compromise
    or cancel out the \"old-school\" appeal would tip it off the edge. "

  body: '...Update: looks like Marat''s project found its $25k funding at Kickstarter
    in under eight hours! Maybe that suggests that there could be a more capacious
    niche than I suspected after all. Or maybe it just confirms that his aesthetic
    is spot on for the niche. '

    500 years back to design letterpress type appropriate for the early 21st century.
    \ Much more interesting would be coming up with faces that owe little or nothing
    to the sensibilities of the 16th century. But, yes, his aesthetic is spot on for
    the private letterpress niche, alas.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n"

    and I was more impressed than I ever remember being\r\nwith a designer. He has
    a touch of genius, and I never use that\r\nword lightly. So although it behooves
    me to think critically about\r\nhis design decisions, I have to take into account
    that he's likely\r\nto be exactly where he needs to be with this.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    fault Maret for knowing his market.\r\n\r\nFine books is not the only market for
    letterpress work today\u2014there is also the whole area of special printing processes
    (letterpress, embossing, die-cutting, foil stamping, engraving, etc.) for high-end
    and/or arts sector job work.\r\n\r\nI wonder if P22\u2019s Stern (Jim Rimmer)
    has found much use for that sort of thing."
