A question concerning that horizontal element at the top that's used to affect the actual curved drawing: I can imagine there are advantages to having such a one-step-removed, one-dimensional control, but would it also be possible to make the same sorts of modifications directly on the outlines? Or does it simply get too confusing in terms of not being sure what you're editing?

> drop FontLab and use FontForge.

Well, FontLab has a lot going for it, so it would be better -although I understand perhaps against the spirit of open SW- if Spiro worked in FontLab too. I suspect they'll be the ones knocking on your door...

Are there any significant advantages? Maybe if I find the time I will do a comparison.

u should download the inkscape sources from the SVN and compile

here the compiling inkscape how-to, on mac, win an gnu/linux:

http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/CompilingInkscape

our 'D' screencast was made in inkscape from svn running on debian gnu/linux, and paper and pencil

more info here

the svn developer version is somewhat unstable yet!

in the screencast example we wanted to show spiro, compare with bezier nodes, and show how inkscape live path effects work, like layers that u can add or quit

we think that the 'harmonic softness' of spiro (like rubber band) make this splines an ideal for use in primive paths, and wanted to try

yeah, it's rigth for this!

but, it is better to trace contours also, as can be seen at the end of that video of this LGM 2007 conference, when the speakers talk about spiro and trace glyphs contours incredibly easy

None of these, as I've seen them so far, can really develop a complete font file the same way FontLab can, though. They seem like good tools for sketching an idea, and can take it to a pretty finished state, but there's still a lot of work to be done in FontLab. I hope somebody creates a tool that takes the best intuitive parts of Kalliculator, LivePen, and Spiro, and combines them into a full-fledged font development tool.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">hrant: I'm with you. There are applications, though, for which skeletons are appropriate, and Inkscape at least gives you the choice, as well as a much more sophisticated way to increase their expressiveness.

I'm working on the chapter of my thesis that includes the comparison with Ikarus, so I just made this graphic, comparing Spiro with the example that Karow gave in his 1991 paper "<a href="http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/volume4/issue3/ep044pk.pdf">Digital Punch Cutting</a>". As you can see, it takes about half as many control points to achieve the same level of quality. I haven't tried the Autocad spline directly, but from what I have been able to find, it's based on NURBS, which is a polynomial spline roughly similar to the cubic Lagrange spline at the heart of Ikarus. I'd be very surprised if the Autocad and Ikarus splines were much different.

Dave: I'm still working on the stability question. It turns out to be a more interesting (i.e. harder) problem than I first thought. I have some Javascript code which is slightly better than the C implementation, but now I'm encouraged that a different generating curve may actually be even more robust. I'll release something before too long.

@FeelTheKern: Combining parts of Kalliculator and LivePen isn't possible, since they are proprietary programs. How Spiro works isn't a secret, but its available under the GPL which means if any other program includes it, it must also not be secret. (Or pay Raph lots of money! haha :-) When I spoke to Frederick about making Kalliculator free software a few years ago, he didn't seem convinced, but there are rumours that he's changed his mind so fingers crossed :-)

Probably what will happen is that Inkscape's calligraphic pen path tool will be extended from a 'one shot' tool to a skeletal one with much more control. There are existing efforts to add basic type design features to Inkscape directly too, for developing SVG Fonts, which will make the Inkscape -> FontForge workflow a lot smoother.</div>

I haven't yet tried the similar feature of Inkscape. I suppose it could function in a sufficiently different way to not be infringing. Has there been any cause for concern?</div>

I wish it were more specific about the patents involved. At a minimum, the term "Skeletal Strokes" is a Microsoft trademark, so Inkscape's similar feature would have to be named something else. If that's the only issue, it's not such a big deal. Still, it should be investigated to assure that there isn't more to it.</div>

From an Inkscape dev: "maybe maybe maybe by the end of the year, but no guarantee"

From another: "Our goal is, before all, a stable and usable release. Right now the
codebase is VERY destabilized, probably more so than ever before, due
to all the refactorings. As I wrote recently, even I sometimes have to
go back to older stabler build to do some work. If we really focus on
this, we probably can stabilize it enough for releasing within the
year, but we have to work hard for that."

It seems the developers are also trying to fix this huge bug in the software: https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/264052</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@FeelTheKern: Installing X11 on Mac OS X is easy :-) Its on the Mac OS X DVD and is a simple double click install. Then to install and run Inkscape or FontForge you just download their Mac builds, drag them to Applications, start X11, and then click their icons like a normal Mac OS X program. However....

@James: Building these tools from source is a requirement if you want to see the latest and greatest features. FontForge is notorious for having no hard dependencies, other than X11, and the latest version from CVS is often quite far in advance of the last released and packaged version. Similarly, Inkscape is currently in a rapid development phase and you'll need to build that from source too in order to see the latest Spiro features. I recommend using <a href="http://www.gnewsense.org">gNewSense</a>, a version of Ubuntu with no proprietary software. That way you can see what a 100% free software system can do, and all the information available for Ubuntu will be applicable. The website offers an ISO CD image file you can burn off and restart your computer with in the usual way. 

If you get stuck, just post on this thread specifically where you're at and I'll try to help out. </div>

This is true that FontForge will function fine without dependencies, but there are some libraries that will add features if installed (most notably libspiro, but there are others, listed on [[http://fontforge.sf.net]]). Though the CVS gets well ahead, at least George does make the effort to post a release package on an almost monthly basis.</div>
