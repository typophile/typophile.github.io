    have the exposure of say Cambria. I think John Berry has set a book in it. I'll
    point him over here."

    whom I respect tell me that it is very readable and sets easily.\r\n\r\n<em>Not

  body: "Yes, I designed and typeset the interior of a book in Constantia recently:
    <em>Shambling Towards Hiroshima</em>, a short novel by James Morrow (San Francisco:
    Tachyon Publications, 2009). I was a bit surprised at how well the typeface fit
    the story; I was a little worried that Constantia might look a little too elegant
    for that particular text, but when I tried it out, it worked wonderfully. It even
    held up as I created an unusually spacious text block (because the book was so
    short). I was pleased to have an opportunity to put Constantia to use as a book
    face; I had previously used Cambria, for a very different book, and that worked
    well, too. The OpenType features (used in InDesign) made production infinitely
    easier than using a non-OT font would have been. \r\n\r\nI haven't seen the printed
    book yet; it should be out very soon."

    are indeed wonderful. "

    an orient-themed book (assuming the title in indicative). Good call.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
