  > Restaurant & Catering)\r\nLooks like something I've seen before.\r\nAlso looks
  like a Deco or moderately Gealic look.\r\nIt was probably designed in late 1980's
  or early 1990s.\r\nProbably from a classic foundry.\r\nNot sure.\r\nAny help?\r\nThanks!"

    seen a lot of typestyles through 8 years in commercial pre-press and 3 years of
    my own studio...\r\nSometimes I draw a blank. (when I shouldn't, DUH!)\r\nI can
    always count on this community and I love it!\r\nThanks again, nicely done.\r\n\r\n"
