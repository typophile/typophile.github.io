  body: I think it's probably <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/alternate-gothic-lt/">Alternate
    Gothic Com No 1</a>. There are a host of other similar typefaces such as <a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic">League
    Gothic</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/">Trade
    Gothic Bold Condensed No 20</a>.
