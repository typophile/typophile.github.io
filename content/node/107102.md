  am interested in matching this font for a restaurant menu project. The font is serif,
  a book weight, slightly condensed, has a slightly taller cap and ascender height,
  is somewhat like Clearface (but not), has an x-height that is also slightly taller,
  and the loop of the \"a\" is more like a slab-serif face (more full round, than
  sloping downward. All help is very welcome. Thanks"

  body: "Thanks Mike for the reference.  \"Philippedada\" says a digital version (Regular,
    Italic & Bold) named Aetna was part of BigFont, a FontBank CD in early 90s. However
    it is possible that the original digitization was done by OPTI -- they did make
    some fonts from scratch. In any case the digital fonts are now orphans in legal
    limbo.\r\nJaspert's _Encyclopaedia of Typefaces (1970)_ is helpful on pre-digital
