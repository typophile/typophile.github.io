  like to try and tackle that, or suggest that the experienced coders look into it.
  It could, for example, become a plug-in module to the JQuery [www.jquery.com] JavaScript

  are we  neglecting because they are not easily typeset on the web?"

    {\r\ntext-indent: 4em;\r\n}\r\n\r\nAlso, the best way to approach web typography
    is to let go of the 'finer points' of control that you would normally have on
    paper. \r\n\r\n\"The use of real Small Caps is one that comes to my mind\"\r\n\r\nAgain,
    CSS:\r\n\r\nyourTag {\r\nfont-variant: small-caps\r\n}\r\n\r\n\"Given the scrolling
    nature of the Web I would imagine that space between paragraphs is preferable
    to indented paragraphs for most forms of text setting.\"\r\n\r\nI agree (though
    other's may not, of course). The web is often more of a 'pan and scan' medium
    where people are looking for excerpts vs. sitting down and reading an article
    from start to finish. Having the visual breaks between paragraphs makes that task
    a bit easier.\r\n\r\nWhatever you do, don't indent AND have spaces between paragraphs.
    Way too redundant for my tastes. ;o)\r\n"

    problem is that you are assuming. Again, you can't assume anything about my web
    browser based on my screen (without standing here next to me). \r\n\r\nIt sounds
    like you have some preference to horizontal scrolling, which is fine and all,
    but most usability testing seems to indicate that people prefer vertical scrolling
    when it comes to web pages. "

    body: "There might be something to the horizontal scrolling argument. Maybe the
      resistance  to (discomfort with)  scrolling this way has to do with the position
      of the  scrollbar? It could well have to do with right handedness and the vertical
      scroll conveniently placed to the right of the content. With a horizontal scrollbar
      reaching over way to the left to advance to the next column just does not <em>feel
      right</em>. Do the usability studies have any insights into why people prefer
      vertical / dislike horizontal scrolling?\r\n\r\nJust a speculation, but as people
      get used to the trackpad and mouse wheel scrolling (I have the Apple's Mighty
      Mouse - unidirectional ball in mind), our natural reading habits may resurface
      and \"turn the web on its side.\" \r\n\r\n"
