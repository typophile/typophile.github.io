  & Jerry's Phish Food lettering. Since I'm no expert at anything 60's, I thought
  I'd let you guys kick around the question. \r\n\r\nthanks in advance."

    style. It looks handmade to me. There are some great 60s Psychedelic fonts here,
    however:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/psychedelic.html"

      she put pen to paper but I don't think she's comfortable enough doing that.\r\n\r\nThanks
      for the link, however, hopefully something closer to that Phish Food lettering
      can be found."
