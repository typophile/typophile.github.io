  has similar qualities with Trebuchet. It needs to have multiple weights, especially
  a light one. Any suggestions?"

  body: "Trebuchet\u2019s design is a pretty idiosyncratic one. So it will be nearly
    impossible to find something which looks like it. My advice is to define some
    specific features you need/want to preserve and start looking for a font that
    fulfill them."

  body: "to riccard0:\r\n\r\nYeah I've noticed :). Found some alternatives though.
    The \"sharpness\" of the upper case diagonals is an important feature ... and
    it has to have a two storey lower case g ... etc.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks for the suggestions...\r\n\r\n"
