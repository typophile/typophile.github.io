  member of the Sintesi Superfamily. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vorschau_sintesi_01_6480.jpg]\r\nExisting
  font Sintesi.\r\n\r\nSintesi diffears from the usual conformation of a Megafamily.\r\nStrictly
  speaking are both Sintesi and the new release semiserif fonts. \r\n\r\nIndeed the
  two sisters could not be different. While Sintesi unfolds its traditional character,
  its strong contrast and the perceptible feather-ductus the new release features
  robust and contemporary forms.\r\n\r\nWhich naming do you consider appropriate to
  describe this situation? Thanks for your vote and suggestions.\r\n"
