body: "hey, here is a revised set. Im liking the back monogram and am thinking of
  using this on the front,what do you guys think of lines i added?(to the front )\r\nAnd
  as for a picture of the jewelry,i dont have any sorry,but i can tell you its very
  busy with a collection of different shells,im trying to emphasise the hand made
  quality of it but also put it into a professional context,so that is why i thought
  of hadriano because it is a sturdy type face but the 'a' still has character. So
  i thought that the packaging and card should complement the jewllery without mimicking
  its visual aspects.\r\nI hope this makes sense!?\r\n-Al\r\n/edit/ Hey i have posted
  a new card still final touches to be made but i have added colour,i should have
  explained earlier that this is for a family friend,and the card u see is the front
  and the back,i also have made some stickers which will be used on lime green/light
  blue packaging,and there is a price tag sticker there too but its a bit wierd(the
  paua shell)\r\nAnd the whole punch idea is good,but i think its alittle time consuming,but
  gave me some ideas as to showing the product through it as these cards and stickers
  will be placed on or with the neclaces,earings e.t.c.\r\nthanks alot for all of
  the helpful input,its been better than bad its good.\r\nAl (as in Alistair-a guy)
  :)\r\nps is it 'jewellery' or' jewelry'....?"

    a hip hop rapper. Please use proper sentences. Two: that is an expensive card,
    a full bleed card, plus it paints you into a corner it terms of other communications.  Their
    is no flexibility with that design. Three: In the future being a web designer
    please post your images in web frendly formats like jpg and gif.   '

    why i did it,but i will take note for next time.\r\ni agree with the fact that
    there is no flexability with the design, but by 'full bleed' where you refering
    to the fact it has photos on the back? \r\n\r\nhi ho hi ho its back to the drawing

    a PDF. It makes it so much easier to inspect details. So alow me to 'axe' number

    That bleed card if its for more than one person will push printing costs up at
    least 10% and in this economy thats a lot.

  body: "I quite like the arrangements of the dots, maybe you could get a bit more
    mileage out of that. As for the typography, the 4th example (Castellar?) doesn't
    seem appropriate (Not that I've read the brief). For some reason I'm drawn to
    the second option (not sure what the font is) but would prefer to see the tagline
    in Avenir-Light as per 3rd example.\r\n\r\nAlso, you might want to resonsider
    the contact details, I can appreciate the contrast that you're trying for with
    the san/serif used next to each other, but it doesn't seem to be working.\r\n\r\nThats
    my 2 cents worth.\r\n\r\nShaun"

    going for the second one(the type is hadriano light).But it didnt seem to look
    as clean,what i might do is shrink the top line and replace the tagline with avenir
    light as you suggested. im gonna spend some more time on the basics first.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nAl"

    balance out the spacing between the letters as it appears uneven. \r\nGood Work"

  body: "Well, I think as you are a jewel designer you are the best one who knows
    which fonts to use. But I will tell you how I think your card would look better
    for me. \r\nat backgrounds I like first one at top. I would prefer to make \"K\"
    darker than the illustration in its background, you may even make it black, so
    you can balance with the huge white space more. You may try also to resize that
    jewel illustration to make it bigger and make part of it as if it is out of the
    card { it is just a suggestion here }.\r\n\r\nFor the front face, I disagree with
    the illustration at first card at top, circles over darkbackground can have many
    meanings, something like stars or globes in sky, may be? \r\nthe one at bottom
    which contains same circles with one line is a nice gemotrical abstract for jewellery,
    it tells me that you are simple and modern. You still base your jewels on circle
    shape only, why not a polligrame or triangel also, or any shape which is entitled
    to jewels?  if you want circles only because it is related to your style, or any
    reason I think your name should have to change the idea of writing your name with
    normal font, you may go to some display font which has a cirlce gemotric basic..
    I suggest here an  idea: what about making letters of your name as jewels and
    make the line pass them instead of passing some circles? that may require the
    name to be bigger in scale, and require a new, less effortive, and better orgnized
    layout.\r\n\r\nI would recommend the  text to change in some parts to be like:
    Tel. Mob. E-mail/Email/email.  + \"New Zeland designer jewellery\" that way and
    in italic. It will be fine if you use a serif font for it either. And I recommend
    to be sure of leading between lines because the spaces between lines aren't look
    equal for me in your information area. \r\n"

  body: I think it looks great, and I"m talking about the .jpg you posted.I think
    you could look at the type, but I think you're pretty close. I would work on the
    informational type that is now in the sans serif, either make it flush with the
    other information or move it enough so it isn't "almost" flush. I don't know if
    you're going to hole punch the holes or not, but that would be a nice touch. The
    lines are great. Don't show photos of the product on the business card. Keep in
    ambiguous enough that it doesn't get outdated. I wouldn't change too much on this,
    it's clean, simple and elegant. How about instead of black doing a metallic silver
    or bronze? Overall, a great job.

  body: I think the first example (the black card with the more free-flowing beads)
    is MUCH more evocative and enticing. The beads in the form of the necklace (the
    gray version) seems forced and predictable.

    \r\n\r\nNow guncry, I think the front and the back are at odds. One side is static
