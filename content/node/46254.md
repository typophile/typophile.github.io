    know if there is a digital version.\r\n\r\nThe bottom one is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/bramley-sh/\">Bramley</a>."

  body: Thanks Mark. I had not a clue on the bottom one. I found a freebie called
    Shadowed Serif for the top one, but the shadows in that font are somewhat jagged
    compared to the printed sample. Don't know if it has been rounded through multiple
    reproductions.
