  body: "I think you're right that they're both custom.\r\n\r\nThe western one is
    definitely custom, look at the stroke/serif variance in the T's. I've seen fonts
    that are similar, I'll see if I can find them.\r\n\r\nI'd bet  that <a href=\"http://www.vllg.com\">village</a>
    is custom, as it's a logo. If chester is around, he'll probably give you an answer.\r\n"
