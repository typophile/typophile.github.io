  body: "I know the reflex answer would be to say Avant Garde Gothic Alternates for
    the A and V, but the R is totally wrong for that font. The A and V could have
    been drawn, as they are just straight lines. So I  would say find the R and you
    have the font. My first impulse was Univers, but the R in [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atbrazilia/atbrazilia-three-25492/|Brazilia
    Three]] has a bit less flare in the leg. There are probably other, better choices,
    that was the first one in alpha order that seemed pretty close.\r\n\r\n- Mike
