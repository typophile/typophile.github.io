body: Does anyone know of a font that is similar to the one used in (traditional,
  slightly old fashioned) sheet music to indicate tempo - like Allegro, Andante, Ritardando
  etc.? The terms are always written in italics, and in older sheet music have an
  almost woodcut flair with slight chips at the edges. If you know the font(s), I
  would be grateful for a hint about where it can be obtained.

  body: 'Thanks, Renko, but if the character map you point to is the full map, then
    it lacks the ordinary letters of the alphabet, as far as I can see. Some expressions,
    like fff and pp are obviously one character (btw with a look similar to what I
    am after). Possibly Allegro etc also are cast as one character, but hardly in
    Sonata, it seems. The best solution would be to find a font with correctly shaped
    alphabetic letters. '
