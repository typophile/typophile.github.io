  body: "This ought to be something from Stephen's list of freehand serifs (sorry
    I don't have the link). Another thought is Ingrimayne Types by Robert Schenk.
    I will go look through those.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Nathanael (number3pencils) already answered this on the album thread, but
    I'll repeat the answer here for the sake of reference. The font is his own creation
    Newt, former called Salamander. The light weight is used here. Newt is yet to
    be released (arrangements are being made with Veer according to Nathanael), but
    you can follow its development in the <a href="http://typophile.com/Salamander">Typophile
    critique section</a>.
