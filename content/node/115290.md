body: "I'm looking for a slab serif with open shapes and contrasting italics. I really
  love Salvo Serif, with its round O and in general very open round counters: http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/salvoserif/\r\n\r\nHowever,
  its italics are really just oblique:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/l0jaoIB.png\">\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know of a similar font with true italics? "
