body: It&#39;s been a while since I studied graphic design. Amazing how quick the
  rust sets in. There was a time when I could name a typeface quicker than...a very
  quick thing!!! <BR>I&#39;m pretty sure I ought to recognise this typeface. Can anyone
  enlighten me? And if possible tell me where I can download a .ttf? <BR> <BR>Thank
  you <BR> <BR>Bev <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/55420.gif"

  body: What bothers me is when layer effects are added to type it often radically
    changes the nature of the original type and often not for the better.

  body: Yves, <BR>Maybe the Typophile Powers That Be should put up a new banner...
    something like &#34;Do NOT look here for free fonts&#34;.  <BR>It&#39;s getting
    endemic, lately. <BR>Poor students, poor designers, poor everybody.

  body: The banner should say instead &#34;Do NOT ask us for free versions of commercial
    fonts&#34;, since there are some fonts that were intended by their designers to
    be distributed for free. <BR> <BR>I agree such wording should be in the  opening
    of the FAQ in prominent &#40;RED&#41; letters. Maybe even a brief rationale for
    that, if necessary.

  body: Woah! Sorry I am new here - no offence intended! I don&#39;t know whether
    it was designed to be a free font or commercial. I remember having it on my computer
    a long time ago so I wrongly assumed it might have been a free typeface. <BR>
    <BR>Apologies <BR> <BR>Bev
