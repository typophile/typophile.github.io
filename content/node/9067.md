body: hi there, i am a graphic design student  doing a project on an exhibition of
  explorers of the last 250 years and am looking for a typeface to use for the identity.
  the typeface is for use in the logo. <BR> <BR>i am keen to use a serif typeface
  but not too classical, a contemporary interpritation would be ideal, can anyone
  suggest any favourites or nice ones? <BR> <BR>the artwork i am producing contains
  certain details of victoriana and floral flourishes but in a fresh way, a bit deconstructed.
  i want the work to look contemporary but with one eye on past styles of the explorers
  era, so i feel the chosen typeface must mirror this concept. <BR> <BR>any help is
  greatly appreciated.

  body: hi stefan, thanks alot for your reply. i have checked out your site and am
    very impressed. <BR> <BR>&#39;hattrick&#39; is the sort of font i am looking for,
    a cross breed of serif and sans serif, it encapsulates the kind of fusion i hope
    to bring to this peice of work. <BR> <BR>i particularly liked &#39;hilarious&#39;
    also. stylish. <BR> <BR>thanks again, i&#39;ll let you know how things go!

    target="_blank">FF Nexus</a> may be ideal for this sort of thing. It&#39;s rooted
    in some <BR>classic serif proportions but the finish is modern. Comes with  <BR>swash
    weights that may work well with your flourishes. Also  <BR>sports <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&amp;displayfontid=FF.11466.0.0"
    target="_blank">sans</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&amp;displayfontid=FF.11468.0.0"
    target="_blank">slab</a> companions for flexibility.

  body: What about Auto, from Underware? Old-time fluorishes with a bezier finish,
    and three different italics. Check out Italic 3 in particular. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=auto&amp;id2=overview"

  body: your help is greatly appreciated people as always. i am still considering
    my options on this one!  <BR> <BR>i feel that with the typeface being used primarily
    for a logo and therefore a corporate &#39;styling&#39;, i have to take a little
    time to experiment. this logo will be the &#39;face&#39; of the exhibition to
    appear on all promotional stages and media, so i really wouldn&#39;t like to rush
    it. <BR> <BR>the typrface has to be fully legible quite small, no smaller than
    probably 7pt. <BR> <BR>just to say, i was only recently introduced to this site,
    and already i have found it to be of great help, other peoples opinions, i feel,
    do indeed help, and open up avenues of typefaces i never explored before.
