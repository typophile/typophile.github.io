    :)\r\n\r\nLarge amounts of text, meh, if it's printed well I wouldn't complain,
    but it doesn't exactly have a lot of contrast &mdash; why don't you try and see
    for yourself?"

  body: "The paradox with Oberon (and other fonts like it) is that it's totally NOT
    readable in long texts, but reading a lot of text in it is the only way to forget
    how ugly it is too.  :-/\r\n\r\nWhat's the brochure about?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "If you use the version with lower case, instead of capitals and small capitals,
    it is legible and beautiful... but I still would not recommend it, from the sound
    of your question. If the brochure is to be very readable even by elderly people
    with poor vision under poor lighting in a hurry - perhaps it is a booklet of instructions
    of what to do and who to call in an emergency - then something bolder would be
    required.\r\n\r\nIf you want to take no chances, use Century Schoolbook."

  body: "I think the main problem here is that the Book version is way too thin for
    larger amounts of text (at what is usually understood by \u2018text sizes\u2019).
    Something between the \u2018Book\u2019 and the \u2018Bold\u2019 (probably closer
    to the Bold) could work.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nHave a look at these two:\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/43186/barbedor-family.html\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/56467/alcuin-family.html\r\n\r\n(however,
    I wouldn\u2019t recommend to use Barbedor on bright white paper \u2013 the darker,
    the better!)"

  body: "Incidentally, my quip about Century Schoolbook reminded me of something...
    recently, but I can't remember where to find it again, in some specimen book or
    other, in addition to Century Expanded (and, presumably, some other members of
    the Century family, like Century or Century Roman itself, Century Oldstyle, Century
    Catalogue, and Century Schoolbook) there was an example of a typeface named Century
    Wide.\r\n\r\nI thought it might have been in one of the earlier ATF specimen books
    where the Century series appeared - or perhaps in something from Linotype when
    they licensed the trademark, but so far my search hasn't turned up what I thought
    I saw.\r\n\r\nCentury Wide had much the same proportions as Century Schoolbook,
    not being a bit narrow like Century Expanded... but not Century Schoolbook's heavier
    weight, or serifs tending towards Clarendon."
