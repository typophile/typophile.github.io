body: "For several months I have been working on my typeface, Theory Serif. It has
  made great progress and I was gradually learning how to use FontLab.\r\n\r\nSince
  about an hour I have been trying to solve a problem I created by accident. I don\u2019t
  know how it happened, but I must have duplicated the glyph \u201Co\u201D and deleted
  the glyph \u201Cn\u201D in the process. I fixed it by adding the \u201Cn\u201D back,
  by opening a backup of my font file. However, the o is now double in the font mapping
  and while I can find it, I can no longer see it (as a duplicate) in the actual glyphs
  window. When I find and double click the letter, it jumps back to the main glyphs
  window, with no particular glyph selected.\r\n\r\nI have been going back and forth,
  but I couldn\u2019t find anything about this in the user manual, in forums or on
  Typophile. Right now I can no longer export the typeface as a font, it comes back
  with an OTF error, due to the double mapping with the same letter. How do I remove
  this letter, or how do I fix the \u201Cn\u201D and \u201C0\u201D mapping issue?\r\n\r\nHere
  is a screenshot of the find box showing the duplicate \u201Co\u201D:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen
  Shot 2014-02-10 at 01_5625.58.44.png]\r\n\r\nTo make this question clearer: I cannot
  see or select this glyph, it does not show up anywhere. I can find it in the mapping,
  but I cannot delete the duplicate instance."

  body: "Thank you, Nick, this helped. I was able to copy and delete some glyphs.
    It destroyed the metrics and kerning classes for the lowercase \u201Co\u201D and
    replaced the \u201Co\u201D component for the respective accent letters with a
    square, but that was relatively easy to fix."
