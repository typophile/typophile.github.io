  let's take the \"#\" glyph, to design it I made two vertical shapes and two horizontal
  ones, they look perfect when unmerged but as soon as I merge them their alignment
  gets all messed up:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flabunaligned_5786.jpg]\r\n\r\nTo
  solve this problem I've increased the size of all my characters, went from 500 height
  to 1000 height and this kind of problems started to disapear since now I have much
  more space to move the points around, there's still some unaligned lines, especially
  the curved ones in complex characters but I've pretty much solved it.\r\n\r\nMy
  question is, is it fine to have a typeface with such high height? Will people run
  into any render problems when they use it?\r\n\r\nThanks! "
