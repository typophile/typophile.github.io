body: "I know this is a bit cheeky to ask about because its not about type but does
  any one know what this fold is called? I have attached an image. I know the 4 panels
  across fold into a parallel fold but what is it called with the other 3 rows added?
  Does that question make any sense? There are 24 pages all together.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for help in advance. "

  body: Hmmm. I'm not sure if there's an official name for it...or at the very least
    I don't know it! Maybe "4x3" fold?

    this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/accordion_6464.JPG]\r\nThat was followed
    by 2 parallel folds, like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2parallel_3616.JPG]"

  body: "I think some outfits might refer to it generally as a \"map-fold\" -- i.e.
    anything with multiple folds in both directions. \r\n\r\nBut you'll still want
    to communicate very clearly with mock-ups or diagrams which folds you want where
    and consult with a production manager to make sure it's possible. Do you want
    a Z-fold vertically followed by a parallel 4-panel fold? Or do you want a tri-fold
    followed by a parallel fold? Edge to the top or edge to the bottom? etc."

  body: "Do as Kent says: work closely with the printer. Make a dummy. & make sure
    you and the printer consider how much any type block or image area may \"move\"
    as the thing is folded and paper is used up to accommodate the folds and the increasing
    thickness of the thing. You may have to manually move some items to or away from
    the folds.\r\n\r\nCheck out\r\n\r\nhttp://www.foldfactory.com/index.php\r\n\r\nI
    did not look to see if they deal with a question such as yours; they might.\r\n\r\npowers"
