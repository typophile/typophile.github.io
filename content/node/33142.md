  i come in contact with on a day to day basis that utilizes type has some sort of
  rounded features softening the edges. i'm not saying the aesthetic is entirely off
  the mark, just seems weird that rounded types have come to mean organic. i guess
  childish/cute and soft means healthy and good for the enviornment...pure perhaps?
  has anyone else noticed this? does it bother anyone?\r\n\r\n_will"

    don't draw this parallel. Sounds like there are several ideas/trends that overlap.
    Maybe it's worthwhile to identify the different trends. For instance, lots of
    polluting consumer items are styled to look soft and round (like cars). At the
    same time, lots of people concerned with sustainability and green materials don't
    follow the \"soft and cuddly\" esthetic. Form, in a lot of cases, is not following
    function, it's following trends. \r\n\r\nI think \"organic\" applied to type means
    there are human, natural elements, as opposed to mechanistic, geometric or modular.
    This could be anything from the proportions to the serif shapes to the curves
    to the edge quality. Not necessarily rounded or cute. "

    a long time ago. First by the cooption of it's formal stategies by Corporate Capitalism
    and then by the pastiche of Postmodernism."

  body: ">childish/cute and soft\r\n\r\nThat's only one kind of curve, not that I'm
    prejudiced against cute. The sinuous curves of art Nouveau are not 'cute' nor
    are the curves of Caslon's muscular italic. Curves can be dynamic, like the Concorde,
    or sexy, like--well choose your favorite lady or gentleman. \r\n\r\nSharp corners
    and straight lines are mechanical, and can have their own  power, but the world
    of curves has a much greater variety, both of form and mood. "

    thinner weights but a few areas of the fatter variety. it got me looking at rounded
    letter forms. i love the way that face shines in it's fatest form. the contrast
    of sharp to soft. it started to make me feel as if the usual completely rounded
    forms were like squishy, plush toys; filled to the gills with foam and bloated
    for no better reason than because. \r\n\r\nw|m"
