body: "After a stint of some headline serif (and false-serif) fonts, I went to the
  opposite direction to neutral sans serif, and drew a font to resemble Helvetica.
  I made an effort not to look at any samples of Helvetica during this (pretty much
  impossible to do these days, I found out).\r\n\r\nHere is the result of my week:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tacit_4950.png]\r\nI
  was surprised how ingrained the basic Helvetica(ish) shapes were in my head. And
  I was also surprised how wide the basic Helvetica is; my design is almost condenced
  (well; I'm a Finn, so narrow typefaces come naturally to me). None of the glyphs
  are an exact match to Helvetica, but the overall look comes pretty damned close.
  Some glyphs I decided to make clearly different. Some of the glyphs were a bugger
  to draw; this sort of neutral design allows very little bumping\u2026\r\n\r\nI also
  made an alternate two-storey g and a single-storey a.\r\n\r\nSome glyphs still need
  a lot of work, but overall it's starting to be representable.\r\n\r\nWhat's your
  \ opinion?\r\n"

  body: "I like the narrow design!\r\nSome random notes:\r\ndouble-storey g is too
    narrow (and has a very big hear)\r\nsingle-storey g is a little too wide at the
    bottom (on the left side)\r\ntop of s is a little too close\r\nquotation marks
    sure are pointy! ;-)\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, guys-\r\n\r\nAlternate g is way too narrow. Single-storey is too
    wide, and that terminal is too high as well. Lc s is wobbly in way too many directions.
    Needs a lot of work. If I remember correctly, Helvetica has pretty pointy quotation
    marks as well. I went with round punctuation.\r\n\r\nMore to follow."

    attach pdf to the original, since I have no glue how to do that here\u2026\r\n"

  body: "Slow down, Tomi!\r\n\r\n- Tittle on i is too small and close\r\n- t is very
    narrow\r\n- Bicameral g is from a totally different font (reverse italic)\r\n-
    8 does not relate to construction of other characters\r\n- % does not require
    ligature (Is that what this is called in this instance?) IMHO\r\n- Inside of n
    too symmetrical\r\n- w is black\r\n- Helvetica comparison is undue (stronger influence
    of contemporary fonts)\r\n\r\nI think with a font like this you must spend many
    months as the originality of \r\nthe design is not the main concern and cannot
    deflect attention from the quality. \r\nI have noticed you draw very quickly but\u2026
    Hare and the tortoise with some things.\r\n\r\nBest wishes"
