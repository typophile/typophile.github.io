body: "<strong> [[Indices]] : [[Blogs]] : Typographica</strong>\r\n\r\nFounded in
  May 2002, Typographica was one of the first \"blogs\" to focus primarily on typography.
  The site was very active for many years until a dry spell in 2005-06 when software
  issues and time constraints limited new content. In July 2007, Typographica marked
  a reawakening with its annual <a href=\"http://typographica.org/001103.php\">review
  of the year's new fonts</a>. \r\n\r\nTypographica is edited by [[Stephen Coles]]
  and [[Joshua Lurie-Terrell]]. Contributors include [[Mark Simonson]], [[Yves Peters]],
  [[John Butler]], [[Dan Reynolds]], [[John Hudson]], [[Joe Clark]], [[Ben Kiel]],
  [[Stephen Moye]], and [[Grant Hutchinson]]\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typographica.org\">typographica.org</a>"
