body: "i am looking for some suggestions for a children's after school arts program
  logo.\r\n\r\nafter speaking with the client and asking what she wanted the logo
  to convey, she responded:\r\n\r\nfree-flowing whimsey, creativity, and individuality
  within a clean organized structure. \r\nAnd the font clean and kid-like.\r\n\r\ni
  have presented the first round and she likes the font NB Fett, which i used here
  (slightly altered):\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/show?BT5\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/casa_3_5630.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nbut
  she prefers this design (but not the countryhouse font)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/casa_1_5169.jpg]\r\n\r\ni'm
  not convinced that this design is completely the best direction, but it is perhaps
  a good starting point. so any suggestions for other kid-like fonts are greatly appreciated.
  maybe something that is somewhat bulbous or rounded, but not TOO goofy. as she said,
  the font should be clean and kid-like.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\ngregg "

    It wasn't made to be a "kid" typeface, but it always reminds me of a grade school
    student's model script. I'd go with the monoline versions (not Classic, Rough,
    or Nib), as they seem more childlike compared to the refinement of a modulated
    stroke.

    I would consider these very cute fonts:\r\n\r\nemma script\r\n\r\namerican typewriter
    (maybe)\r\n\r\nchowderhead\r\n\r\ncooper black\r\n\r\nHoney (I use it in my icon)\r\n\r\nClarendon\r\n\r\nPharmacy\r\n\r\nTeen\r\n\r\nSmilage
    (my fav choice)\r\n\r\nSkia and Myriad can also work.\r\n\r\nI also I suggest
    that you make the orange in the roof color more brilliant.\r\n\r\nMikey :-) "

  body: I'd go with Softmachine -- be the first kid on the block to use it. Even better,
    you can use its OpenType features to do a terrific outline effect. I'm always
    in favor of using newly minted typefaces.
