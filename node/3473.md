  body: Hi, Did you ever see the Vialog? It was designed by Werner Schneider &#40;he
    designed Schneider Antiqua for Berthold&#41; and is used for the Underground and
    other public transportation in Munich. Even Vienna uses Vialog for signage. <BR>All
    the Vialog fonts are part of the Platinum Collection at Linotype. The special
    set of signage symbols and arrows is online at <a href="http://www.linotype.com"
    target="_blank">www.linotype.com</a>. <BR>The pi-fonts are used by different other
    public transportation systems. <BR>Even Pfizer Medicals Germany uses Vialog for
    their house style. <BR>Enclosed the PDF with all the Vialog signs. Great for signage.

  body: The Lisbon metro face was done by David Quay for Wolff Olins. Jeremy Tankard
    is not the designer of it. Not his style.

    I am pretty sure that Telecom New Zealand has just updated to Bliss as well. How
    unique.
