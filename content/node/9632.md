  body: I&#39;m somewhat embarassed by the fact that I&#39;m only jumping on the easy
    ones lately. I&#39;m trying to blame it on too much Real Work&#153; and school,
    but when I made that point to myself I felt like I hadn&#39;t really convinced
    myself. In fact I got the impression that I was suspecting myself of merely making
    a lame excuse for laziness. Excuse me while I battle this out with myself.
