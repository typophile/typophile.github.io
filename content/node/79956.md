    a zip file? Or to condense the files into one large PDF file. I'm a student and
    need to look for jobs/internships really soon, and need to get my stuff together!\r\n\r\nThanks
    for posting this, Typeraisin!"

  body: "Step 1: Choose your best work and break it down into categories. Don't limit
    how much work you choose.\r\nStep 2: Photograph all your physical pieces at once,
    using the same lighting and camera. Retouch all images to have similar color balance.\r\nStep
    3: Collect screen shots of your digital work.\r\nStep 4: Sort all the images into
    categorized folders so that you can easily reuse them for multiple online and
    offline portfolios.\r\nStep 5: Write descriptive copy for everything.\r\nStep
    6: Set up a huge indesign file of your portfolio. Put in everything. Don't include
    page numbers!\r\nStep 7: Generate a custom PDF featuring the most appropriate
    work for every application! "
