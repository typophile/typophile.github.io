  2004), Leslie Cabarga shows samples of a font design by David Berlow, called <strong>Tobagdad</strong>.
  I've been looking for it ever since I read the book, but it looks like it has completely
  vanished. Any lead ?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

  body: Thank you for your interest in the type.This family was started in 1999, and
    has been expanding ever since. Print fonts exist, and over the summer I added
    Greek and Cyrillic. The current work is on the agate/screen font masters, and
    I'm in no rush to release it until after the rasterization specification for email
    fonts has settled...but I'm working on that. The name of the font was changed
    shortly after 9/11 to Arabianite.
