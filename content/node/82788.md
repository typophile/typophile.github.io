  body: Thank you oldnick! Any idea of a similar base? I mean, I understand that they
    applied some flourishes as well as sone shadow/layering effects, but I'm hoping
    to find a very similar base, if anything! :)

  body: Looks like it's based on Onyx Italic, but only the <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/onyx/fonts/">upright
    style</a> seems to be available digitally.
