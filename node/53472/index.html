  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been some time since I last posted a logo for critique, but you have all been so helpful <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the past<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that I thought I would throw another one your way.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo - Full Color (low resolution)_6151.png]</p>
<p> 
This was a full identity package that needed to work across multiple media: web, print, etc. It needed to be inviting but still professional.</p>
<p>I really wanted to push myself on this one and get the identity to ride purely on the strength of the type, the color, and the layout. Too often I try to solve a logo problem by just finding the magic shape or illustration. The result is often that I don&rsquo;t spend enough time exploring type and color as a way of unifying and carrying the overall brand identity. So any thoughts along those lines would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it came out on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->website<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->business card (PDF)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> , and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the letterhead (PDF)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The design is done, so this is just a learning exercise for me.</p>
<p>Peter</p>

<p>That was one critique I had of the logo as well. But I was stuck with the second line. What could I have done with the second line to de-emphasize it? (Other than shrinking it).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When dealing with any kind of design you want to focus on breaking down the elements into their respective hierarchies.  In this case I would assume that the doctor&rsquo;s name is the most important element.  Assuming it is, I would have done three things differently.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the doctor&rsquo;s name bigger.  His name is his brand so emphasis on that is important.  I would also have made that the colored element instead of regular ol' black.</li>
<li>Drop the medical credentials down right underneath the doctor&rsquo;s name.  They are necessary only for validation that he is a medical professional.</li>
<li>Drop the rules to tighten up the whole package.  If you (or your client) feel that they are necessary, keep them in but take them down a point size or two and tighten them up.  Too much negative space in your composition will make it feel like it isn&rsquo;t cohesive.</li>
</ol>
<p>I always find it&rsquo;s fun to revisit a logo even when it&rsquo;s out the door.  It&rsquo;s a great way to learn from your mistakes and grow as a designer!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Those are very helpful. Regarding #1: That&rsquo;s interesting, I actually made his name black because I thought that would emphasize it more. And regarding #3, you&rsquo;re spot on about tightening it up. That was probably my biggest hesitation about the logo when I handed it off though I don&rsquo;t think I could have articulated the problem at the time.</p>
<p>Many thanks for the comments.</p>
