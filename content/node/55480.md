  body: "Good start. But m is too narrow and a is too wide. You\u2019ll need to either
    adjust other letters to work with a or give up the circular a, I would try the
    former as a circular a in script could be great if you can just make it work.
    Also, make the n-i connecter match the others."

  body: "ya, that's what some other people told me as well about the \"a\". I'm not
    sure which ones to adjust b/c I like all the shapes.\r\n\r\nI'll work on the connector.
    I purposely made it not match to form a nicer curve but I'll try the original."

  body: "I like it.\r\n\r\nThe rhythm it creates is interesting. \r\nThe letter a
    is a bit different, like James Puckett says. It is a bit too round for the others
    (they stand out). \r\n\r\nOn the other hand I've seen similar things in monospaced
    typefaces (the m letter narrow).\r\nAs I said, I like it."

  body: "What if your \"a\"s wouldn't be completely rounded but more aligned with
    other letters so they have vertical stem on the left side of the bowl? But not
    too long one. Just long enough so it's visible and also short enough not to be
    disturbing.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be better to look at DIN's \"a\" what I mean.\r\n\r\nOtherwise:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>right
    half of \"m\" is narrower than the left one so it looks unbalanced</li>\r\n<li>i
    would probably benefit with some curve to make it part of other letters. I like
    the original better than this one. But it should probably be curved toward \"l\"
    not \"n\".</li>\r\n<li>end of last \"a\" should probably have a curve too</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

    another one.\r\n\r\n@ litera - this font? http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-din/
    I don't see what you're talking about if it's this font. you mean moving the stem
    to the left so it looks like a \"b\" but a funky \"a\" ?"

  body: "I would think litera meant making a portion of the left side of the bowls
    of the \"a\"s straight/vertical. You might try that; it would probably echo the
    curves of the \"m\"/\"n\" better. I'd also make the \"n\" wider. \r\nThat said,
    this looks pretty cool. I think it's coming along quite nicely."

    I understand now. Thanks for the clarification.\r\n\r\nSo, before I go any further
    on this logo which one of the three should I polish up?"

  body: "thanks altaira. SOmetimes I'm so clumsy with words. And instead of saying
    \"a\" I should say \"o\" when refering to DIN. Didn't even check the font when
    writing. It was the design of letters that was in my head. Looking at those now
    I see it doesn't have an appropriate \"a\" anyway. \"o\" would be more suitable.\r\n\r\nAnyway.\r\n\r\nTo
    comment on the last \"tripple pack\". I would go with the #1/#2 font version because
    it's more distinctive than #3. BUT also include changes into #1/#2 that people
    here suggested (including mine ;)\r\n\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

    you all are saying #2 then I posted it on this other forum\r\n\r\nhttp://www.designerstalk.com/forums/showcase/45352-logo-critique.html\r\n\r\nand
    they are all saying #3 lol. Although, I think part of the reason they only like
    that one is because it is more bold. hm.."
