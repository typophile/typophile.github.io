  text]] I released a [[http://typophile.com/node/54211|new beta version]], completely
  renewed in its details.\r\nIn the meanwhile, I won the attention of some locale
  publisher who looked at sketches and a couple of hardcopies I left under a table,
  so the encouraged me to work in order to apply Novena in their publications.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Novena_Typophile_5841.jpg]\r\nThere
  is an attachment for printing: a light-weight 4 pages PDF that better demonstrates
  how it actually prints, that's its main target.\r\nSo, next steps are finishing
  my regular text version and accelerating the work on the rest of the family.\r\nI
  hope not to disappoint expectations and, for that reason, I need a lot of critique
  from Typophiles.\r\n\r\n<strong>MarS</strong>"

  body: "I'm sorry there's so little critique on this one. I've seen it posted several
    times now and it's definitly good enough to get some attention. It's a lovely
    typeface, but there's really nothing about it that strikes me. \r\n\r\nThe terminal
    on lc \"a\" could be more exciting. The same goes for the ear on lc \"g\". The
    ear also forms a dark spot which you might want to correct optically. The leftmost
    stroke in uc \"\xC6\" should lean that much, in my opinion. The letter is a bit
    wide. I love the lc \"t\". Lc \"x\" has some problems with the serifs on the thick
    diagonal.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm bothered by the lack of human details despite
    the leaning stress. It feels very mechanical."

  body: "I feel a bit like Frode about this. It looks so polished that it's hard to
    see where there might be some room for work \u2013 especially for a beginner like
    myself. \r\nIt's quite impressive! Though I do agree about the \"mechanical\"
    look; it feels very \"cool\", and could maybe be more distinctive. I must say
    I'm impressed with this, but it doesn't excite me on a deeper level, or feel like
    something I've never seen before. Though I guess that's not the worst thing that
    can be said about a newspaper face.\r\n\r\nOne thing I've been wondering about
    is some of the proportions (and bear in mind this is coming from someone working
    on her first font \u2013 so take with a big grain of salt).\r\nSpecifically, the
    \"n\" (& thus, the \"h\") looks a hair narrow to me when compared to say the \"o\"
    and \"bdpq\". Actually, the \"n\" even seems narrow compared to the \"m\" and
    the \"u\", the \"m\" looking like it's about 2 units short of being a perfect
    duplication of the \"n\", and the \"u\" almost exactly equal in width to the \"n\".
    Is that intentional?\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the \"u\", its bottom left might be a
    tad heavy/lumpy (the same is true for the analogous curve in the \"n\"). And the
    (unparalleled?) upwards motion of the \"u\" serifs feels odd \u2013 but I think
    I have a personal problem understanding \"u\" serifs. ;-)\r\n\r\nAnd I dare hardly
    say this, but the \"9\" still feels a bit unbalanced, though I can't really say
    why.\r\n\r\nApart from that, I don't think I can offer much helpful input. I wonder
    where the experts are?"

  body: "Wow! I'm really shocked by your latest comments, at the point I feel myself
    strange and confused \u2014I cannot blame anybody for that.\r\n\r\nAfter reading,
    I put hands on work trying to correct what I did bad and... oops! I forgot to
    backup the original version so I made a disaster. Fortunately I recovered it from
    the OT font, though I missed a lot of stuff like masks, guidelines and so.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
    it did not discourage me: curiously I love to hear critiques and start over again
    and again \u2014even when I lose an entire font file ;-)\r\n\r\n<strong>Nina:</strong>
    <em>Actually, the \u201Cn\u201D even seems narrow compared to the \u201Cm\u201D
    and the \u201Cu\u201D, the \u201Cm\u201D looking like it\u2019s about 2 units
    short of being a perfect duplication of the \u201Cn\u201D, and the \u201Cu\u201D
    almost exactly equal in width to the \u201Cn\u201D. Is that intentional?</em>\r\n\r\n1.
    Look at these four pictures, where I compare proportions of the pair \u201Cm-n\u201D
    on Novena (before I broke it) and Georgia (quite different, I guess) by placing
    the \u201Cn\u201D within the mask:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/m1_5374.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/m2_6489.jpg]\r\n\r\n2.
    Almost the same happens by turning the \u201Cn\u201D upside down and comparing
    against the \u201Cu\u201D (the \u201Cn\u201D is within the mask space again):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/u1_5343.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/u2_6678.jpg]\r\n\r\n3.
    I loved your newborn Ernestina at a first glance (I'll make my comments later).\r\n\r\nHuh!
    I think that <strong>there</strong> is the reason by which you friends find the
    face so \u201Cmechanical\u201D: in my obsessive search of matching the propper
    measurements and proportions, I missed the fact that type design \u2014design
    as a whole\u2014 is the triumph of sensitivity over given rules to create its
    own rules.\r\n\r\nWell, it's late now to deal with philosophy, and I must face
    a hard work on that wretched font.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n<strong>MarS</strong>"

  body: "Marcelo,\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if I came across too harsh. I honestly think this
    is an impressive, and already very polished, font, which could maybe just use
    a little treatment with the diamond file here and there :-). And since you seemed
    quite desperate to get more feed-back on it, I figured I'd note some things that
    struck me \u2013 but like I said: \r\nYou really shouldn't follow *my* opinion
    to the letter! (Ignore the bad pun.)\r\n\r\n<em>forgot to backup the original
    version so I made a disaster</em>\r\n:-{\r\nGet a backup strategy. I've been there,
    & since then I've become quite religious about doing daily backups of all the
    stuff I'm working on. (Also, keeping multiple [dated] versions is a good idea.)\r\n\r\nRe
    the \"m\" and \"n\", I guess we're looking at different fonts for guidance/input
    ;-). Here's Swift and Constantia:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/swift-mn_5270.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/constantia_mn_4170.png]\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDon't

    instinct acting from inner necessity.\r\nThe creative mind plays with the objects
    it loves.\"</em>\r\n\r\nThough I am not a Jung supporter, I believe he is quite
