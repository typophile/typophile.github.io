body: "Hi there.. I've searched for months for the right font to finish off my MJ
  Memorial sleeve.  I've done a quick search here and I haven't found anything positive
  about Michael Jackson, so please no comments on the subject, haha.  \r\n\r\nI have
  an almost completed sleeve on my left arm. It is art nouveau inspired and very colorful.
  \ I am looking for a font that can be used to finish this.  I know it has to exist
  somewhere the way it does in my head (I can't draw or I'd just make something up
  myself).  \r\n\r\nIt needs to be light, flowing, magical, unique AND go with an
  art nouveau style.\r\n\r\nIt will say \"so anyway, I think we've captured some good
  magic here\"\r\n\r\nAny leads would be helpful.  I've looked at several font websites
  and haven't found anything I want on me forever yet.  I hope this post explains
  enough for someone to grasp what I'm trying to say.  Thank you for your help! "

    range of styles, as is art nouveau pattern and design. For example, are any of
    these book covers close to what you are looking for in terms of lettering or similar
    to the design you have already?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.abebooks.com/books/RareBooks/jugendstil-design-motif/art-nouveau-books.shtml|Abebooks

    know anyone who could help you draw it? "
