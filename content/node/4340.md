  body: The only folks I know who have done work with truly randomizing glyph selection
    are LettError, with FF Kozmik. <a href="http://www.letterror.com/foundry/kosmik/index.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.letterror.com/foundry/kosmik/index.html</a> <BR> <BR>However,
    FF Kozmik is not a handwriting font, but hand-printing. <BR> <BR>Several handwriting
    fonts have been developed that use elaborate contextual rules which produce a
    variable effect similar to randomness, though in fact it is deterministic. One
    is Linotype&#39;s Zapfino, in the AAT TrueType version of the font that ships
    with Mac OS X. I am having difficulty finding a good link to something that explains
    its contextual goodies, however. <BR> <BR>Two other contextual-letterform type
    families are Caflisch Script Pro &#40;Robert Slimbach after Max Caflisch&#41;
    and Bickham Script &#40;Richard Lipton after George bickham&#41;. These two are
    in OpenType format, and can display their functionality in applications such as
    Illustrator CS and InDesign. By way of example, Caflisch Script Pro has 12 different
    forms for the lowercase &#34;p,&#34; and picks one depending on the context. <BR>
    <BR>For more information on OpenType, see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype"

    User Guide PDF &#40;linked on right&#41;.

  body: After reading about this &#40;in particular on LE&#39;s site&#41; I am still
    a little confused. They say that &#34;during print&#34; the letters are randomized.
    Does this mean that the glyph replacement does not happen in real time? Do you
    actually have to wait until it is printed to see these effects? <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

    <BR>I think Hrant is correct WRT mistakes - the direct-mail industry, which uses
    handwriting fonts from vletter and others use the &#39;crossed-out-words&#39;
    method. vletter include back-spacing crossed out glyphs in their fonts, I beleive.

  body: One point of concern I&#39;d have is that should you design something with
    a random font and save it our output at a service bureau, they may open up a different
    setting of the font and the really nice random combination you saw on your computer
    will look totally different when you send it to press assuming you don&#39;t convert
    the text to outlines first. <BR> <BR>Beyond that, making an intelligent OT version
    of the font will preserve the text setting you intended to reproduce. <BR> <BR>Stuart

  body: '&#62;I don&#39;t think that random glyphs are an important step in the development
    of typography <BR> <BR>Oh no, randomness offers amazing opportunities! <BR>I can
    think of two avenues worth exploring: <BR> <BR>Firstly, it is necessary to introduce
    an element of randomness into a font that truly emulates handwriting -- not contolled,
    professional script, but real writing which has the rough creative imperfection
    of humanity, where whole-word &#34;ligatures&#34; are created on the fly. Moving
    beyond, this process, once formalized, could be used to design fonts which are
    not mimics of handwriting, but something else again. <BR> <BR>And secondly: If
    one wanted to mimic the inconsistent quality of letterpress type, which is admirable
    when subtle, giving it life, rather than the dull predictability of high-res digital
    type, then one could arrange a &#34;type tray&#34; of glyphs, where each character
    has variants that are &#34;worn&#34; differently, or &#34;print&#34; differently
    &#40;simulating arterfacts in paper or printing&#41;, and selected at random.
    <BR> <BR>And is there not an element of randomness &#40;effected by a lack of
    total control&#41; in the design variants that occur between different type sizes
    in foundry type? '

    few typedesigners are interested in this randomness &#40;most of you are thinking

    in minor differences, that make the font live more - a subtle randomness. and

  body: Constantin, I would explore randomness if the tools I use made it possible,
    or if I was a programmer. But like most type designers, that&#39;s not the case.
    <BR> <BR>The OpenType format, with its ability to contain mutliple glyphs for
    a single character, can be used to give the appearance of the randomness you seek,
    by assigning different glyph variants of the same character according to the adjacent
    character &#40;i.e. with &#34;invisible ligatures&#34;&#41;. However, it is only
    since last year that the Mac version of Fontlab that does OpenType has been introduced,
    so give it a little more time.
