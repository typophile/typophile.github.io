body: "hello.\r\nalright, i'm a bit stuck in indesign. i have a paragraph style setup
  with a typeface that only includes three ligatures. it's alternates are in another
  font (which i also have), but i can't figure out how to reference the alternates
  without doing it by hand (and this would be insane to do by hand for large bodies
  of copy). is it possible to setup a style that will refer to the alternates for
  ligatures that aren't included in the existing one? \r\nfor instance: style 1, font
  1. includes \"fi\" and \"fl\". when \"ff\" or \"fj\" come up, can it refer to style
  2 (without doing it manually), or is there a setting that can pull up font 2 (automatically).\r\n\r\nthank
  you."

  body: I remember having to do this manually at one point. I always finished the
    layout for the document and then did a find/replace.

  body: I wish there was a way to do this, but as far as I know, there's no way. This
    is why OpenType fonts are so terrific; they do this automatically. If you know
    how to code, you might be able to write a script to do a big find/replace whenever
    you want, but Tiffany's manual method is probably the easiest.

  body: Yeah, but isn't that dependent on what ligatures the system fonts have? For
    example, you can't plop a "contextual" st ligature in the dialogue box in Find/Change
    as far as I know.

    a change of typeface would mess up the whole document and so on.\r\nDid your already
    checked whether your font is also available as OpenType? \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, if you've paid for the two fonts (base + alternates) and have FontLab,
    I think in principle there's no reason why you can't create an OpenType font with
    all the desired automatic substitution routines. \r\n\r\nYou'd have to check the
    EULA and see if this type of modification is permissible, but to my mind there's
    absolutely nothing unethical about it, especially if it's for your own private
    use. You're not distorting the face, you're not re-selling it; you're just trying
    to make your own life easier using the exact same glyphs, fitting etc that you
    paid for."

  body: Terry, actually, I think you sort of can plop an st lig into find/replace.
    I do it with H&FJ's Mercury when trying to add in some of the ligatures that I
    don't believe are normally integrated. When I copy and paste, for example, an
    ffi lig into the find/replace box, it comes up as another character (omega is
    one I've seen often). When I replace all ffi's with omegas, it does just what
    I want -- probably because Mercury lacks an omega glyph, so the ffi takes its
    place. But if you were referring to OpenType contextual ligs, then that's another
    story -- find/replace won't help unless you use it to replace the inputted characters'
    OpenType formatting with ligatures on or off.

  body: Well that's good to know. One of the headaches that comes up when you try
    to place a contextual lig from an expert set into your standard set. (But that's
    Type 1 and True Type only.) I've gotten to a point where I don't even fool with
    Type 1 fonts anymore. These days if it ain't OpenType I don't bother.
