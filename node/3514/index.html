  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  I need to let you know firstly that I'm a chemical engineer with a non-professional interest in typography. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Dealing with equations, as I do, I often have need to use superscript (esp. for exponents) and subscript (esp. for indices).   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  For purely subjective reasons I want to use the OpenType &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot; font, rather than the default in Windows (&quot;Times New Roman&quot;). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  I'm hoping that you're not cursing MS by this stage, because I curse it enough as it is.  I need to use MS Word because I need to use a plug-in which (I think) is only compatible with that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Back to the problem.  Formatting in any of the other fonts works perfectly.  It is exclusively in  &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot; that vertical alignments are off (for my purposes).  I need the bottom of the subscript to be below the line of the main text, and likewise I need the superscript to rise above the capital letter height (sorry, I don't know the jargon).  This happens in every other font, but with &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot; the superscipt and subscript in MS Word are set up to be correct for fractions, so that they neither drop below nor rise above e.g. the letter &quot;X&quot;.  (The easiest way is to try this out yourself.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  I have contacted MS, who indicated that this is due to the fact the &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot; is their 'flagship' OpenType font, packed with all the features - and, of course, MS Word (or Windows?) is not yet compatible with all of them.  It seems this requires MS to make a major overhaul of their software, and is not expected in a patch, or even in the next full version (but perhaps the one after!). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  My questions to you are twofold: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(1)  Given that I only need the plug-in while I am composing my prose/equations, can any of you recommend a (Word Processing) programme that will correctly handle equation-style superscripts and subscripts in this font?  E.g. OpenOffice, Star Office? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(2)  Can any of you contact MS and/or start a petition to get the OpenType features implemented as soon as possible?!  I realise that a lot of you may not regularly use MS products, but I do believe you would be doing a service to typography in general (and to me at the very least) by making these features more widely available to people in the 'real world' (no offence!). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank-you,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  DIV</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  what a surprise to find another Chemical Engineer.  And thanks for the reply. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was thinking about importing equations from either LaTeX or MathML into MS Word, but I don't know whether it's practicable.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Currently I write (somewhat) complex equations using 'Equation Editor' within MS Word.  Although this is not great, it does get the superscripts and subscripts right.  However, when I need to refer to inidividual items in the equations, I prefer to do that in the text, rather than having to open up 'Equation Editor' and create a separarte Object.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EXAMPLE <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Smith and Jones agreed that  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->___    x</div>
