  Following the redesign of the mother-page of the BBC News, the [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/arabic/|BBC
  Arabic]] launched their redesigned website. It is probably one of the first, and
  certainly the biggest site yet to use webfonts \u2013 Arabic webfonts that is. It
  uses a custom version of Nassim by Titus Nemeth. The typeface was painstakingly
  optimized for screen and for web. Hinted by Thomas Grace and mastered into webfonts
  by Tim Ahrens.\r\n\r\nYou can read more on [[http://www.tntypography.com/blog/?p=209|Titus'

  body: "Hi Hrant,\r\n\r\nthanks for your positive feedback. The spacing issue you
    raise is spot-on, but not related to the font, but the only partial OpenType support
    for the Arabic script on the Mac OS and/or browser used. Windows users don't have
    this issue as you can gather from the below screen-grab of FF4b on Win7:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BBCNassim_win7_3524.PNG]\r\n\r\nThere
    are numerous browser/OS combinations that have similar problems, most notably
    the flat-out rejection of Google's Chrome of fontfiles containing GPOS or GSUB
    tables. There is a curious note in the developer's spec noting that:\r\n\r\n<cite>Some
    languages such as Indic/Thai/Arabic need GSUB/GDEF/GPOS support. Probably we should
    support them whenever necessary.</cite>\r\n\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/ots/wiki/DesignDoc\r\n\r\nThe
    font files render well with Uniscribe as it has the most complete implementation
    of \"complex script\" support, though not perfect either as marks such as quotes
    do not kern against RTL glyphs.\r\n\r\nThe technical challenges of \"complex script\"
    development attain a different level of complication on the web were user setups
    and rendering implementations are ever more unpredictable than for desktop development.
    Also, they are largely undocumented and a fair amount of work is trial and error.
    If these are exciting new days for Latin-centred typography as it jumps to the
    web, the work on non-Latin webfonts is a pioneering endeavour.\r\n\r\nFor the
    time being, all we are able to do is develop our fonts to spec and as technically
    sound as possible, provide updates were the situation changes and hope for browser
    and OS developers to catch up with their support for non-Latin scripts.\r\n\r\ntn"

    OSX and Safari you are using and the latest versions seem to implement GPOS kerning
    properly.

    Is the spacing still being tweaked? I ask because the\r\nword to the right of

    the operating system used, rather than on Uniscribe. There is a wrapper in recent
    versions of Windows that is supposed to roll common punctuation glyphs into runs
    of adjacent text, rather than imposing a glyph run break at script boundaries
    or direction changes. I have not tested this with Arabic though.\r\n_____\r\n\r\nHere
    is now Nassim is looking in the new IE9 with DWrite rendering, with subpixel spacing
    and positioning, and y-direction smoothing.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nassimie9_4014.png]\r\n.\r\n[DWrite
    also has its own shaping engines, so does not use Uniscribe. In theory, the Uniscribe
    and DWrite shaping engines should produce identical results, but I did notice
    one discrepancy in WPF (the predecessor of DWrite) so will need to test this in
    IE9.]"

  body: "Thanks John for the clarification. I am on a pretty recent Windows version,
    but have not seen kerning of quotes against Arabic in any implementation on Windows,
    including IE9.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as Karsten L\xFCcke points out, there
    is good news from Google that reacted swiftly to the issues with GPOS and GSUB
    support.\r\n\r\nTheir updated spec now reads:\r\n<cite>Now we support GSUB/GDEF
    table but haven't shipped to Chromium yet.\r\nNow we support GPOS but haven't
    shipped to Chromium yet.</cite>\r\n\r\ntn"
