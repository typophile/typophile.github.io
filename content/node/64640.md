  my studies and I would really appreciate some help with the following. \r\n\r\nWhat
  is the technique or style called when you lay out the a word of several titles and
  adjust the leading of the words so that all the edges aline. For example,\r\n\r\nTHIS
  IS MY \r\nT   I   T   L  E\r\nEXAMPLE\r\n\r\nI have seen this style of layout many
  times. What are your expert views on it? I like it but my taste and understanding
  of type lacks, erm, sophistication at times.  I am wondering how do you best go
  about adjusting the kerning and line height to achieve such an effect. Again, disclaimer,
  please go easy on me, we all had to learn somewhere eh. Please throw me some links
  and help me expand my knowledge, it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nB"
