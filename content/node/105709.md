  body: Because of the way the letters are constructed on an arc, this was most likely
    hand-lettered, based on something as prosaic as Trade Gothic...

  body: Nick is probably right about hand done in the 70s but NewsGothic LT (Bold)  looks
    closer than Trade Gothic - then you can arch etc. in Illustrator or PhotoShop
    to duplicate it today.

  body: And the other bit, San Jose etc. Looks like lettering based on a light cut
    of Bank Gothic. Letter widths and the arm of the E need customisation, though.
