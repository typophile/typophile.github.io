body: I have just staerted to use my local Library's inter-library loan program. I
  have already found some cool stuff ( assuming they are willing to send it of course
  ). But then it occured to me - I might tap into the collective wisdom of Typophile
  about neat things you may have found this way. And I might also remind all & sundry
  that the Library is a great resource! Anybody interested in talking about this resource?

    have yet to try it out myself.

  body: I live in rural NH and have been using ILL for years. It is a fantastic service
    and apparently not something known by most patrons. I hosted a film series last
    year and we got all the movies through ILL. They try within state first but then
    borrow from Idaho or Texas or anywhere if it's not to be had through the state
    system. And doesn't cost a penny!

    magazines published Norway and books from Chapel Hill NC through my university.
    \ Even our local public library will get \"stuff\" on request, although the lending
    time (usually three weeks and not renewable) could be better.  \r\n\r\nRead 'em
    quick!"

  body: "Eben, what you say is absolutely true; ILL is a great resource and maybe
    not as widely known or utilised as it should be. Depending on where you are, you
    may find that local academic and specialist libraries (like St. Brides) will also
    allow you to apply as a patron/borrower.\r\n\r\nI know that certain academic libraries
    form consortia, which allows them to both pool resources and extend their customer
    bases \u2013 my university for example, has reciprocal lending arrangements with
    several other local university libraries and the national library. Very much a
    case of '...if we haven't got it on our shelves, we certainly know someone who
    will...'\r\n\r\nMy librarian recently used a consortium scheme called Borrow Direct
    (possibly only available to librarians?) to lend me, free of charge, a copy of
    <a href=\"http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=45937\">John Dreyfus' 'Into
    Print'</a> \u2013 a book I would have remained ignorant of without her interest
    and ability. Needless to say, it's fascinating!"

    find something cool via ILL? Got ISBN #s?"

  body: "Not via ILL, but from my other favourite source, I've just found a copy of
    'Lettering; the history and technique of lettering as design' by Alexander Nesbitt,
    Prentice-Hall, New York, 1950. Curiously, it doesn't appear to have an ISBN.\r\n\r\nThe
    other fabulous old one that resurfaced recently is 'An Atlas of Typeforms' by
    James Sutton & Alan Bartram, Hastings House, New York in association with Lund
    Humphries, London, 1968... again no ISBN but a Library of Congress Catalog card
    # 68-24227.\r\n\r\nIt's that nice, my friend the bookseller doesn't know whether
    to keep it himself or sell it onto me!\r\n"

    unique find. '

  body: "Ah Craig, thank you \u2013 that would explain it ; ) I'm so used to reading
    republications and reprints I'd forgotten about this being a recent thing.\r\n\r\nBurke,
    I agree with you about Abz; I was an undergraduate student of Julian Rothenstein.
    His other stuff can be found at the Redstone Press in West London\r\n\r\nhttp://www.redstonepress.co.uk/mainpage.html\r\n\r\nI'm
    not wild about the Shrigley stuff; I know it gets huge accolades and it's terribly
    clever, but what Julian and Mel get up to by themselves is much more fun. When
    you say <em>...with artwork I never saw in any of my classes or text books...</em>
    this is an intentional aspect of their publishing M.O. They source the stuff from
    the mid-century that was underexposed at the time; hence the amazon.com keyword(s)
    most frequently associated with their publications is 'designer unknown'.\r\n\r\n"
