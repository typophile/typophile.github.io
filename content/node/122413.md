  appreciate your critique on this text typeface I\u2019m working on. I am not so
  confident yet in the domain of <em>antikvas.</em> I suspect the wise thing to do,
  would be to not attempt to reinvent the wheel, but nevertheless these shapes have
  been on my mind for a while and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to draw anything boring.
  It is intended for 9\u201310 points, sets darker than most text faces and the razor
  thin joins gives it a rather unique texture. "

    \r\n\r\nSome additional comments: The thinning of joins is not primarily inspired
    by pen traces \u2013 and hence, does not necessarily occur where expected. This
    makes me a bit unsure about how to handle contrast in other shapes. For the o,
    I\u2019ve borrowed an idea from Fleischmann \u2013 something I\u2019ve also echoed
    to some extent in b/d/p/q. Curves get a different treatment in terms of speed/angle/dynamism
    for inside and outside \u2013 if there is such a thing as inside and outside here.\r\n\r\nThe
    a and (the bottom of the) g breaks the logical shoulder treatment of n, but they\u2019ve
    got each other (as does the numerals, ampersand and Q), and I\u2019ve been pondering
    adding r to that party too. And X? X is a disaster!"

  body: "Very pretty and satisfyingly grippy. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how well the /G
    and /Q will work \u2014 would have to see them in context \u2014 but they're certainly
    original and plausible shapes. I really like the chunky ascender tops and the
    half-circle bowls. The Satyr /a is as gorgeous as ever, and I'm also fond of your
    solution for the ear of /g, which feels unnatural to me in many typefaces.\r\n\r\nIs
    /U too narrow? The spine of /S a tad too straight? The tail of /Q a bit too straight
    and abruptly cut? I could imagine the latter to profit from some thickening or
    even a serif.\r\n\r\nMost accents strike me as too small and too little differentiated
    for the intended small text sizes. The ogonek could also use more heft."

    feel.

  body: "I think that this typeface despite looking unconventional in some ways is
    also a highly legible text face, and this combination of originality and utility
    is a good thing.\r\n\r\nHowever, I could also imagine someone criticizing it as
    looking too much like Aldus (Hermann Zapf's Palatino Book, but not given that
    name) - if one disregards its very original shapes for some letters, the two faces
    have a similar feel at least."

  body: "Interesting. Care to explain what you see as similar?\r\n\r\nChristian, I
    did look closer at that Q, and the U and S. I also massaged the G a little bit.
    I don\u2019t think the U can be much wider than this. The shoulder gives it so
    much more white inside than for example H. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/update_6415.png]"

  body: "I like the new /S, /G, and tail of /Q. Does the body of the /Q have a subtle
    kink near the apex though?\r\n\r\nThe /U still feels too narrow to me. This width
    might work for a traditional /U with a thin right side, but you have two full
    stems, which raises its demand for whitespace. I'm not sure the low connection
    in the /U is that much darker than the middle of /H, and in any case your /O has
    much more interior space and doesn't look out of place.\r\n\r\nHere's Perpetua's
    /U for comparison:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/perpetua_5830.jpg]\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, is the flag of /r perhaps a bit too light and/or finicky? At text sizes,
    I feel it seems to stand out from the level of detail established by the other
    letters."
