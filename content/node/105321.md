body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sandiego_6256.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis font comes
  from a San Diego Chargers wallpaper. WhatTheFont IDs it as Rogue Sans, but that's
  not it. I'm not sure if the serifs have been added to an existing typeface to go
  with the font used for the 'Chargers' name (see the logo in the top corner of <a
  href=\"http://www.chargers.com/\">the Chargers website</a>).\r\n\r\nAny help greatly
  appreciated! Thanks."

  body: I'm fairly sure it is Rogue Sans Medium with custom serifs, not a different
    font.
