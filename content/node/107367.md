  body: In print I think it depends on quality; the difference between something that
    is merely promotional vs. something that has been created to really show off what
    the typeface is, how and where it could be used. [[http://www.underware.nl/publications/|Underware's
    publications]] are a great example of the latter, I am also a big fan of [[http://www.houseind.com/objects/objects/catalog62collectorbundle|House
    Industries' promotional specimens]] and [[http://www.houseind.com/objects/|associated
    products]]. I think [[http://www.ffmark.com/|FontFont's FF Mark web site]] is
    probably a good indication of what specimens have become and will continue to
    evolve as...
