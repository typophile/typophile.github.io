  features with his PC... if anyone can help, I'd appreciate it.  Here is what he
  asked:\r\n\r\nDo you have any recommendations on PC software capable of using the
  different letter options (swash characters) in fonts such as your Estonia Nouveau?
  \ I purchased a similar font from MyFonts once before (Mussica) in the OTF format,
  only to realize that none of my main software applications (Word, CorelDRAW) could
  use the extended character set.\r\n \r\nI realize the PC is behind the Mac in this
  type of functionality.  I have also considered purchasing a program like FontCreator
  in order to re-map an existing font into different font sets so all the characters
  are available for use (just using different font names).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    they can be a bit pricey, and thought maybe folks on the PC side would know of
    apps that are a little less expensive. I work on a Mac, so my ability to help
    him is limited.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nthanks"

    world. Suite 602 had partial support back in 2002, but the product was discontinued.\r\n\r\nI
    know some apps that <strong>does not</strong> have OT proper support: all Office
    releases (it seems Office 10 will have at least partial OT support), CorelDraw,
    Xara, OpenOffice and Scribus. Not sure about Ulead and ACD software."

    alternates. It's more tedious but as long as the alternates have been given Unicode
    values, you can make a text file which the customer can copy and paste into Corel
    Draw or Word. They can also be accessed with the character map tool. (accessories/system
    tools/character map)\r\n\r\nWindows has supported OpenType(OTF) with no additional
    software required for a decade . . . a couple of years before OSX was released.
    It's the apps that are the issue."
