  My client picked two logos and wanted me to combine the first letter of one of them
  with the other letters of the second option. So I've been massaging this frankenstein
  trying to get the letters to work together. My question is not does it offend, but
  how much does it offend?\r\nThe H is the interloper, not that you should have any
  trouble noticing... thanks in advance for your suggestions.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/havenlogo_3754.jpg]"

  body: "the little fleck at the top of the h is distracting. I agree that the h potentially
    doesn't 'fit' though I don't know I would have made that point if you hadn't pointed
    out the two were combined.\r\nOut of 10 I'd be 'offended' around the 3-4 mark.
    There are logos/type work that offend a LOT more...still that fleck annoys me
    most.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul Ducco</strong>\r\n<a

    body: Unfortunately, they really like the fleck. I shudder to think that may be
      why they picked that h in the first place. Maybe if I made it blobbier.

  body: "Once a client gets involved at that level and begins to pick n mix your designs
    instead of letting you be the designer they employed in the first place then you're
    probably just gonna have to sacrifice the job on the altar of their ego.\r\n\r\nAny
    time spent trying to now make the logo better in your eyes will be wasted because
    the client is unlikely to appreciate or even notice the difference.\r\n\r\nDon't
    worry if it offends because the offence is no longer yours.\r\n\r\nYou may be
    able to pursuade them to choose just one of the original fonts if you tell them
    that other designers on a respected type design forum said the 'h' stands out
    like a sore thumb :)\r\n\r\nThe fleck on the 'h' just looks like a dirty mark
    especially when it's a characteristic that's not in the other letters. It will
    look even more like a dirty mark at small sizes."

  body: "Yeah I hear ya. It's hard not to care though, especially since this logo
    will be one of the more visible ones I've done. I think I'm going to scrap the
    fleck and tell them to suck it. \r\n\r\nDiplomatically of course. "

  body: "If I was looking to remove that fleck I would point out to the client that
    it could cause problems printing at a small size and at large sizes the little
    bump at the top of the h would look like a mistake. I would also \u2018massage\u2019
    the joining strokes, especially the en, and slightly the width of the h.\r\n\r\nTim"
