    the Windows version.\r\n\r\n<em>\u2022 The nature of the tool is the alter the
    entire letter unless I lock down a bunch of points.</em>\r\n\r\nWell, yes, that's
    what it's for: interpolating the position of untouched nodes. The interpolate
    tool has two states for nodes: touched and untouched. A touched node is one that
    has been clicked on while the tool is active, whether or not it has also been
    moved. Touched nodes are, thereform, either moved or locked in their original
    positions. And all the untouched nodes move relative to the locked nodes, i.e.
    the position of the untouched nodes is interpolated.\r\n\r\n<em>\u2022 I have
    to repeatedly drag points to different potential locations until I get a result
    I like.</em>\r\n\r\nI tend to use the ctrl+click dialogue interface, rather than
    dragging, but in either case I don't understand why this constitutes a \u2018limitation\u2019.
    You look at your glyph, and you figure out what parts you want moved and in what
    relationship to other parts, and you touch only the nodes that you need to touch
    to achieve that result, letting other node positions be interpolated.\r\n\r\nThere
    are a couple of things that I do think are genuine limitations of this tool:\r\n\r\n1.
    It isn't dynamically interactive with Fine Preview. I wish it were, so that I
    could get a nice preview of the results while in the middle of interpolate operations.\r\n\r\n2.
    Moving a whole section of a glyph, e.g. a stem, a uniform distance relative to
    another part of the glyph always requires touching at least two points. Christian's
    script seeks to address this limitation, by making it possible to select and shift
    multiple nodes, but it seems to me that it does it in a way that is overall much
    less flexible and powerful than the interpolate tool. Consider:\r\n\r\nLet's say
    I have an uppercase U glyph, and I decide I want to make it a little wider by
    moving the two vertical stems further apart. Using Christian's tool, I can select
    the nodes making up the left vertical stem, and use the nudge left tool to shift
    them, say 20 units. But only the positions of the control handles between the
    bottom selected moved nodes and the nodes defining the bottom of the horizontal
    curve are interpolated. I have to then go and perform the opposite select and
    nudge operations on the right side vertical. Using the interpolate tool, all I
    have to do is lock two nodes on the left vertical and shift two nodes on the right
    vertical 40 units, and the position of the nodes on the curve is interpolated
    along with the control handles. That seems way more efficient and useful to me."

  body: "There are in my mind two different issues here. One is time-saving ways to
    work. And here various software can help to get toward what you want, and what
    to use is a matter of personal preference. \r\n\r\nThe other issue is what a good
    related heavier weight looks like. Here you have a lot of decisions that can't
    be made well by any formula, which I think it James M's point. \r\n\r\nFor a start,
    the visual impact of horizontal and vertical increases in weight will be different.
    This can be taken into account in software, but all diagonal strokes and arcs
    will get double doses if you mechanically bold in both horizontal directions,
    resulting in a lot of ugliness, including clotted joins. I suspect that is the
    issue Frode was running into, prompting the post. \r\n\r\nHow to handle the joins
    is an aesthetic decision that isn't automatic, and this will affect all the arcs
    as well. How much do you want to preserve relative weights, and how much the same
    arcs? You can't do both. \r\n\r\nA further complication is when you have more
    than two strokes involved, like a e W M. Then bolding is going to decrease the
    size of the counters more than in those with two strokes. So again you have to
    make a choice: do you want to widen the glyph? Widen some of the strokes less
    than in other characters? \r\n\r\nThere are other decisions as well, but these
    are enough to show that there isn't one \"right\" way to get a bolder weight,
    and the designer needs to, well, design, as James M. says. \r\n\r\nAnother issue
    is how much you want the different weights to look the same. Frutiger pioneered
    a lot of weights and widths looking similar, with his Univers. But this modernist
    idea is not the only way to go. Jonathan Hoefler, in his blurb for Knockout, argues
    that having different looks in different sizes, as type traditionally did, can
    be a good thing.  "
