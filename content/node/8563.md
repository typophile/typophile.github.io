    up the &#34;e&#34;.  <BR> <BR>--The dash in the middle of the logo looks a little
    heavy to me. <BR>Reduce the height just a hair...it won&#39;t take much. <BR>Round
    off the ends, too.'

  body: Beauty Design, i like it too. <BR> <BR>&#62; post more different examples
    with the roundness of  the n-e-e-u, and make the union of the strokes more rounded.  By
    other way, you can try the stroke of the e at 45%, taste on diferent colors, the
    stroke of the e too. <BR> <BR>i love to see that trama on the left on colors or
    greys... <BR> <BR>Miguel.

  body: "\x03\x14b\v\x03\x14WpI like the simplicity and comcept, but wonder is it
    appropriate to the industry? It is unlike anything else I have seen for web hosting
    companies &#40;most are terrible&#41; but the first thing that came to mind before
    I read what it was, for tah it looked like it was for the  cosmetics / personal
    hygiene industry type of client . <BR>The pattern is really nice, is this part
    of the branding as well? I would like to see it larger.  Also I agree with Kyle,
    it needs rounding . What is the type used in &#34;Neu Solutions&#34;?  I took
    the liberty of a mock-up of my own- hope this does not offend anyone. <img src=\"http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6280.gif\"

    <BR> <BR>ole, I agree that most hosting companies logos are terrible, so I didn&#39;t
    feel like there has been to much of a precedent set for the industry. Also the
    company will be offering design services that are far superior to most hosting
    companies that just kind of throw that in. But perhaps this couldn&#39;t hurt
    to look more techy. <BR> <BR>The font is just good ol&#39; Gill, which I chose
    for its circular '
