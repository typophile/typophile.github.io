body: "The Most Unwanted Song, is mesmerizing: over an accompaniment of bagpipe, tuba
  and accordian (statistically, America\u2019s least favorite instruments), an operatic
  soprano (our least favorite type of singer) raps (ditto) about cowboys (ditto).
  Vitaly Komar and Alex Melamid\u2019s research indicated that the most hated lyrical
  subject is holidays (disliked by 33%), so the song is suitable not only for Christmas,
  but Easter, Labor Day, Veterans\u2019 Day, and Halloween. These interludes are introduced
  abruptly by a children\u2019s chorus (\u201CHey everybody, it\u2019s Yom Kippur!\u201D),
  who couple their refrains with cheerful commercial messages. By the end, the subject
  has shifted to human slavery and genocide. The whole thing, going on for nearly
  22 minutes (the least favorite song length), is as impossible to ignore as a car
  crash.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ubu.artmob.ca/sound/komar_melamid/KomarMelamid_The-Most-UnwantedSong.mp3"

    bit of lite soul I have ever heard. Truly exactly the kind of music I absolutely
    hate. I couldn't listen to more than a minute of it. Whereas the Unwanted Song...
    I listened in horrified fascination, couldn't quite bring myself to turn it off
    because I really did want to find out what they were going to do next.

    these results.\r\n\r\nAccordion is extremely popular in the Midwest (polka) and
    anywhere near the Mexican border.\r\n\r\nBagpipe I can buy - it's very foreign
    to American ears - although - one of the coolest moments in my Halloween memories
    was when I came home from work and heard bagpipes wafting through the air. I thought
    someone was trying to scare the kids but it turns out that there was a lone piper
    standing on a hill about 1/4 mile from my house. That is the way bagpipes are
    supposed to be heard, like when they pipe at the castle in Edinburgh at sunset.\r\n\r\nTuba
    - well - yes although I love it.\r\n\r\nSame with operatic soprano.\r\n\r\nRaps
    and cowboys? Rap and country music so far outsells rock these days that it isn't
    even close.\r\n\r\nHolidays? White Christmas is gigantic.\r\n\r\nSo I think they
    should retitle their song \"The Song of the People\". :)\r\n\r\nNo matter what

    jam he is one of the quickest to reflect  aspects of soloist's licks, making an

    There's a bit of operatic soprano vocals, atonality, and random politically-charged

    inventiveness of the whole enterprise. The length at 22 minutes may be the only
    serious drawback from my standpoint, as it does get a bit taxing.\r\n\r\nThe obvious
