  Fibermark Touche black on side A and am trying to find a nice matte coated black
  paper (with a smoothness akin to a Silk) for side B. \r\n\r\nMy client didn't like
  the grittiness of Pegasus Cover Midnight Black or Mohawk Loop Antique Vellum in
  black. Kromekote is glossy so that's out of the question. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nMuch
  appreciated!"

  body: Also, I should note that I'm trying to avoid printing black so that's why
    I'm looking for black paper.
