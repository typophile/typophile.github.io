  (Oak Knoll Press 2012, p.47), Stan Knight mentions one Johann Singrener of Vienna
  as the first printer to have used sloping capitals with italic lowercase (in 1524).
  Does anyone have more information about this guy, and/or a picture of one of his
  books using these sloping caps ? Thank you very much."
