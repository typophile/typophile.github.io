  body: "\"BEAUTY Counter\" must be <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/garagefonts/freight-big-pro/|Freight
    Big Pro Book]]</strong>\r\n\r\nPS: The /t is a bit different, because is the /t
    of the old version Freight Big Book (not Pro)."

    you can see that /W /C & /S are all different.\r\n\r\nI think Jan is actually
    correct, \r\nit seems like a modified/thinner version of Times (New Roman)\r\ncreated
    for display / titling.\r\n"

  body: "I think Times is on the right track, and I agree with Nick's comment, except
    that I think he meant 'adding' a negative (blank) stroke to make the lettering
    thinner. Maybe not TNR, but some version of Times, such as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times-ten/|Times
    Ten]]? With negative stroke to make it thinner.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
