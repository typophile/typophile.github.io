body: I was curious about the status on this relief project. Any inside information
  about when the font will be for sale? When the Building Letters special edition
  will be available? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m suspect that the response was huge from the
  type/design community, which may have complicated the process.

  body: There&#39;s a PDF included with the font that shows who designed each fleuron.
    Press release will reveal all, but let&#39;s just say over 200 designers gave
    more than 400 fleurons to the cause. Amazing response!
