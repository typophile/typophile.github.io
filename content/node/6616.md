body: I wonder if someone might be able to give a bit of subjective advice.  <BR>
  <BR>I need to get hold of an everyday workhorse range of fonts that support the
  slightly unusual accented vowels in Welsh &#40;w and y&#41; for MacOS X 10.3. Ideally
  not costing hundreds of pounds per family, as its just for my personal Welsh coursework.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve Googled it, but the quality of what I&#39;ve found so far tends
  to be a little bit... suspect. At least, I&#39;d not want to start forking out cash
  without some sort of assurance of the quality of the typefaces from unknown vendors.
  <BR> <BR>The ideal would be something along the lines of Perpetua, or a Garamond.
  <BR> <BR>Does anyone have any ideas, or indeed any general advice on using those
  pesky characters under MacOS? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Sylfaen on WinXP has W, Y with acute, grave, dieresis, and circumflex and
    it comes on Windows or in Office. It was designed by John Hudaon, who has some
    connection with Wales and Geraldine Wade who is from Wales. So if you have a Windows
    machine the .ttf will load on OSX. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/48682.gif"

  body: Sylfaen was designed for Microsoft in 1998 by John Hudson and W. Ross Mills
    of Tiro Typeworks, and Geraldine Wade of Monotype Typography. Sylfaen is a Welsh
    word meaning &#34;foundation&#34;; an apt name since the font stemmed from research
    into the typographic requirements of many different scripts and languages. <BR>
    <BR>This version of Sylfaen supports the WGL4.0 character set, for Pan-European
    language coverage. In addition to Latin, Greek and Cyrillic letterforms, the font
    contains the characters necessary for support of the Armenian and Georgian languages.
    <BR> <BR>and thet&#39;s the description in the font.

  body: 'The only limitation of Sylfaen is that it exists only in a single weight
    and style: no italic, no bold, etc. This is because it was originally made for
    a research project, and not intended to be shipped. <BR> <BR>The Welsh diacritic
    characters you need are  available in all the Windows core fonts, including Times
    New Roman, Arial, etc. and also Palatino Linotype, Georgia, Verdana, etc.'

  body: They&#39;re available in core MacOS X fonts too, but I was hoping to have
    a wider choice really.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/48725.jpg"

  body: Several of Adobe&#39;s type families support &#34;extended Latin&#34; which
    includes Welsh. Minion Pro and warnock Pro are among those which do &#40;also
    Myriad Pro and Sava Pro, which are not likely to be of interest for this purpose&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Additionally, a number of the typefaces we expect to release in the next
    6-8 months will also have such support. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T
