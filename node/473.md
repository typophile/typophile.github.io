  body: I think both Plantin and New Century Schoolbook have versions with infant
    a&#39;s and g&#39;s. A slab-serif I think would be nice for kids. How about italics?
    Have you considered using italics? Many typefaces have single-storey g&#39;s for
    their italics. I&#39;m just thinking, PMN Caecilia italic might be good. Sassoon
    Primary is an italic sanserif type for teaching handwriting. If you don&#39;t
    want to use italics, ITC Officina Serif has a single-storey g. For Officina Serif,
    the g is essentially the same as the Sans counterpart, so there won&#39;t be a
    problem. What&#39;s wrong with showing kids a double-storey g anyway? I don&#39;t
    think they&#39;d get confused at all.

  body: About the single-storey &#34;g&#34;, maybe Seagull? Keith suggested slab typefaces,
    and in fact, almost all of them &#40;Lubalin, Beton, Egyptian 505, etc&#41; have
    single-storey &#34;g&#34;s.  <BR> <BR>About the &#34;P&#34;, I think I never saw
    a connecting one. I&#39;m currently developing a typeface for a primary school
    teacher; it&#39;s a typeface for teaching children to write. In the reference
    book she showed to me, the &#34;P&#34; is the only non-connected character.  <BR>
    <BR>About teaching with sans/ living with serifs, I think it will just bring us
    to another legibility/readability discussion. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a contradiction,
    I think it&#39;s natural.

  body: Oops. Forgot the link to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/seagull/"
    target="_blank"> Seagull</a>. Notice that it has a single-storey &#34;g&#34;,
    but a double-storey &#34;a&#34;.

- body: Here are the Ps and gs for Bembo, New Century Schoolbook and Plantin. The
    Univers g is the type I am looking for. These are all Adobe versions. Do other
    versions exist with different lowercase Gs? <BR>   Italics would give me the g
    I&#39;m looking for but I really need the normal roman style. &#40;It&#39;s funny
    seeing that sans serif  Gs change to double in the italic and serif Gs change
    to single in italics.&#41; I also noticed that egyptian/slab serifs have the g.
    Initially I passed the idea up because I wanted something to contrast well with
    a sans serif . But you&#39;ve made me think about it some more. What if I just
    used all slab? <BR>   I&#39;ve shown an example with Chaparral MM. Even though
    I lose style contrast, I could just keep the point sizes far enough apart.  <BR>

    Bembo&#44; New Cent&#44; Plantin&#44; Chappy MM"> <BR> <BR>Seagull has a great
    g, but I need a more &#34;classic&#34; look rather that playful. It is for children,
    but I need more &#39;normal&#39; letterforms. Something more playful could be
    fun though. Hmm.. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the input so far, it&#39;s been helpful!

  body: What Kent said. <BR> <BR>&#62; sans serif Gs change to double in the italic
    <BR> <BR>? <BR>This is extremely rare. In fact I can&#39;t think of such a font.

- body: Ah, the Monotype schoolbook versions are great. I&#39;ll try the Bembo version
    since its P connects. The &#39;a&#39; was another letter that concerned me but
    I had given up on that one. It&#39;s good to see that these schoolbook versions
    also have the &#39;basic&#39; a.  <BR>   I&#39;ve been comparing the gs again
    for the last few minutes, and I have absolutely no idea what made me think that
    &#34;sans serif Gs change to double in the italic&#34; and even, for that matter,
    that &#34;serif Gs change to single&#34;. I don&#39;t have the type book in front
    of me right now that I was using at the time of my earlier post so I can&#39;t
    go back just yet and look again to see what made me think that. It was probably
    just that I was comparing a ton of both serif and sans serif fonts in both their
    roman and italic forms all at once, and doing it quickly at that. <BR>I just went
    looking with ATM for an example of either case of the g switching forms, and couldn&#39;t
    find one, so I must&#39;ve just been going cross-eyed. <BR>Hopefully I didn&#39;t
    cause you to lose too much sleep wondering what in the world I was talking about.
    <BR>Again, thanks for the help. Too bad my mistakes are going to get archived,
    huh? <BR>=&#41; <BR>

  body: '&#62; serif Gs change to single <BR> <BR>That one&#39;s actually pretty common.
    <BR> <BR>BTW, another place you can find &#34;kiddie&#34; a/g glyphs &#40;that
    don&#39;t slant&#41; is in so-called &#34;upright italics&#34;, which are however
    very rare &#40;and they generally still incline, although by a minute amount&#41;.

  body: To me, single-storey a&#39;s and g&#39;s in &#39;traditional&#39; seriffed
    type look a bit strange, especially for revivals like Bembo. They are just not
    compatible with these early designs. The double-storey a and g are more of a humanist
    roman thing, where things were written slowly and carefully; the single-storey
    ones, on the other hand, came from the italic hand which were written a bit faster,
    without lifting the pen so much. I guess that&#39;s what distinguishes written
    and printed forms. I wonder if showing traditional seriffed faces like Bembo to
    kids with single-storey &#40;schoolbook&#41; forms might confuse them? I don&#39;t
    know...

    going crazy.. perhaps only partially.. <BR>Here are serif faces that switch from
    double to single story g when going from roman to italic: <BR>Bernhard Modern
    <BR>Christiana <BR>ITC Clearface <BR>Corona <BR>ITC Cushing <BR>&#40;but still
    no examples, as HHP wrote, for sans serifs&#41; <BR>There&#39;s probably more,
    but at the moment I don&#39;t have time to check them all. &#40;Notice those are
    B-C.&#41; <BR>KT, good points. For example, &#34;ea&#34; is a common letter formation,
    and the two together are a bit forced. I&#39;m not sure it would confuse them,
    but it does look awkward.'
