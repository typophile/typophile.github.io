  would be very grateful if you could give me some feedback on one of my designs.
  I was asked to design a poster advertising the St Bride library.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_5712.gif]"

  body: "I like it a lot. I doesn't shove the book reference in your face as much.
    And I like your old check-out ticket - I think we were the last generation of
    students to have those. I think it blends the contemporary black-and-white with
    the old-school very well.\r\n\r\nMy only concerns are: \r\nThe T in the headline
    because it's so decorative, I found it kind of distracting against the other characters
    that you used.\r\nAnd some of the \"stamped\" characters are hard to read because
    they are too light (presumably because they don't have enough ink on them).\r\n\r\nBut
    other than that, I like it a lot.\r\n\r\n-Scott"

    body: "Thank you very much for the positive feedback Scott. \r\n\r\nThe actual
      poster size is just over A3 so the type is a little clearer when produced at
      full size but i can see the points that you have made. But I am glad that you
      like the design!\r\n\r\nMany Thanks"

      body: Hi, I like this creative idea very much and it looks very different to
        what could of been done. Making the background greyscale is again different
        and makes the white type stand out. The library ticket is a nice idea but
        I'm sure sure if its ledgable to read easily. Nice design well done

  body: My only criticism - and I like this a lot - is that I might darken the greys
    in the background a touch so that the white type pops a little more. Just to decrease
    the contrast a bit.
