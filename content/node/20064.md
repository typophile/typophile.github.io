  body: "That blue colour to indicate links really isn't visible enough -- clicking
    my original reply \"Yup\" took you to the Psy/Ops page with the <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_deadwood.html\">Deadwood</a>
    family by [[Philip Krayna]] and [[Rodrigo Xavier Cavazos]]. But I reckon nobody
    saw the link. :^/\r\n\r\nI guess <em>I</em> was the one being too clever for my
    own good."
