body: "Hello. I tried searching Typophile to learn how to convert my fonts and use
  them as webfonts. Alas only  one topic turned up with outdated links. Webfonts are
  interesting and topical, and may deserve a special Typophile Section devoted to
  them.\r\nMeanwhile I would appreciate any how-tos, cautions, and accounts of experiences
  with online embedding of one's fonts. For example are those online services that
  convert one's font to a webfont reliable? What about security, copyright etc.?\r\nThanks!"

    (incl. some designers) use Font Squirrel for a reason. Nevertheless answers to
    your other questions depend on your intended usage (as a type designer, or user/buyer)?"

  body: "Thank you abattis. FontPrep  from fontprep.com is nicely designed and creates
    a neat folder with all the css,  svg and html files necessary with just one click.
    \ \r\nAt first nothing worked until I added encoding declaration to the html \r\n<meta
    http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />\r\nA test
    page displayed my chosen font correctly in both Arabic and Latin in:\r\nChrome
    (Win7 and OSX)  , Safari (OSX)\r\nIt did not display my font, only a generic one
    in:\r\nThe latest Firefox (Win7 and OSX), IE 11 (Win7)  \r\nThe svg file did not
    display anything in Illustrator - what is its function in a webfont?\r\n\r\nAny
    help with this will be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: 'I now found out why it did not work in Firefox:  I had set FF Preferences
      to display another font. In the Mac it is  / Content / Advanced /Arabic  After
      checking the box "Allow pages to choose their own fonts instead of my selections
      above." it works fine.'

  body: Have you considered webfont services like FontDeck or TypeKit? These people
    have got a whole team working just to serve webfonts. Or you have special requirements
    (nonlatin script etc.) that can't be met by current webfont service providers?

  body: "Thank you Grubstreet both services you mentioned are very interesting.  I
    was wondering whether there is a technical guide about how to convert my Arabic-Latin
    \ fonts to woff or whatever else is necessary to make them available for use on
    a customer's website.  FontPrep did all that automatically, and it worked - except
    in Firefox!!\r\n"
