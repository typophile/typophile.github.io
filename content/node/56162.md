  body: "Hahaha. Now I'm in serious stomach pain from laughing so hard. Thank you
    &ndash; very liberating :-)\r\n\r\nThough I thought the Papyrus examples weren't
    the worst. My favorite must be this:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.yourlogomakesmebarf.com/2009/02/three-for-the-price-of-one/\">[img:sites/default/files/old-images/crane-schools_4417.gif]</a>\r\nAn
    endlessly expandable concept! Genius!\r\n\u2026Whereas <a href=\"http://www.yourlogomakesmebarf.com/2009/03/keyboard-fail/\">this</a>
