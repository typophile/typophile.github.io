<p>I love the pangram and it is crazy genius. It&rsquo;s also very easy for me to remember. We were just in the Virgin Islands where liquor cost about a fourth of what it cost here. So we did pack our bags with five dozen liquor jugs. They actually even have special boxes for the tourists to load &lsquo;em up.</p>
