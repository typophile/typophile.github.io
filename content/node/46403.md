  term for herself. She''s like many of our family members who don''t understand the
  difference between serif and sans, even when you point it out to them. I told her
  to look in Martha Stewart Living for Mundo Sans (they just switched from Trade Gothic
  or whatever), and she couldn''t tell any of the fonts apart. But she calls herself
  a <strong>Typophilistine.</strong> '
