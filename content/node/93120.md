body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI've modified two glyphs in a ttf \"pi\" font. Trying
  to use the generated font, I see the glyphs in InDesign's Glyphs Palette, and I
  can insert the one I want - but all the Unicodes are \"NULL\". Probably because
  of this, when I try to change my character style to use the new instead of the original
  font, I get missing character boxes in ID.\r\n\r\nThis happens whether or not, having
  opened the original font in FontLab Studio 5.1.1, I do Generate Unicode followed
  by Generate Names - though when I do that, the Unicodes are correct in the font
  window (as they were in the original font). \r\n\r\nI have used preferences that,
  based on  the FL manual, seem appropiate for doing minor mods to TT fonts. What
  am I doing wrong? Any ideas?"

    MS Windows Symbol; I haven't changed that. Its's a Windows font and I'm editing
    it on the Mac. Is that relevant?"
