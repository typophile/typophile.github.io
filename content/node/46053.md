  inserted font used in the credits of \"Harold and Maude\". It has some art deco
  elements but is less decorative than most art deco fonts I came across. Please let
  me know if you have any ideas. Thank you!\r\nTatianaK1\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4874.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_3562.jpg]"
