  body: Confused by your answer, Scott. He's looking for something <em>lighter</em>
    than Eurostile Light. <a hef="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/process/stratum_2_ot//">Stratum</a>
    has Thin and Light weights. Maybe <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_qtype_square_ot/">FF
    QType</a>.
