    outlying texture of that to which you can then apply that mottled look. Would
    <a href=\"http://cl.ly/2KY5\">Nori</a> fit that?\r\n\r\nOr you might hire a calligrapher,
    maybe <a href=\"http://cl.ly/2KbO\">Lila Symons</a>, that could really give you
    exactly what you are looking for. :)"
