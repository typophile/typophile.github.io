  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hello everyone, this is my first time in the forum and I love it! so much helpful info. <BR>I guess i thought of this topic because I myself am depressed. this is primarily due to he fact that I have not been able to design my own buisness card (never truly happy with my results). I also find myself to be extremely self critical of my own work. This inturn makes it hard to start design projects. I'm pretty sure this is common among other designers. maybe some feedback on this matter will help me as well as other designers. <BR> <BR>IM</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Being of hispanic heritage my dream would be to promote social change. Minorities are often depicted in an unfavorable way, this is due to the fact that minorities have not taken a true interest in promoting a good self-image. Often the image displayed are from people who have no idea what it means to be a minority. This depiction become our an unwanted representation of who we are. example: I find it desturbing to see minorities in movies cast as &quot;maintenance workers&quot; or &quot;waiters&quot; things like that. I would also like to be able to help design better products for companies who export their goods to the USA. I belive better design promotes economic growth. This is my goal.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have designed many business cards and logos for myself over the past 40 or so years.  I have never had any of them printed.  I look at them a few weeks later and say, &quot;I can do better.&quot;  What you have to realize is that you grow as a person and a designer every day so you will never design something good enough for the you who will see it a few months from now.  There is a place where you have to say, &quot;This will work for today.&quot; and just accept your human failings as they are.  You cannot ever be perfect but you can be satisfied to know you tried your best in the amount of time you had.  Remember, a business card, above all, is just a place to put your name and phone number, not your soul.  Take the pressure off of yourself.   <BR>Take 4 hours only and design a card. Print it on a Laser printer, that way it does not seem so precious or so permanent. If in 6 months, you can't stand it, do another 4 hour maximim card and go about your life. <BR> <BR>My family came here to the US from Greece.  We are such a small minority that nobody even knows we exist. I have worked sweeping floors in a resturant, as a laborer in a steel mill, and as a laborer in a construction job.  It was hard, dirty, tiring work but it was honest work and nothing to be ashamed of.  I worked my way through college and now work in an office as a designer but I am the same person I was in the steel mill scraping slag with a pick and shovel. <BR> <BR>Don't worry what biggotted fools may think of your herritage.  You know better.  Be proud of who you are inside right now, today. Don't measure your success as a human being by the size of your bank account&ndash;certainly not by the comments of fools.   <BR>The way you talk about your dreams to make the world a better place tells me you have the soul of a great man. The best thing you can do in this world is help others and love your family. You can do that as a designer as well as anything else. <BR> <BR>Best of good luck to you, <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Question: what do you do when you have creative block or are depressed?  <BR> <BR>When I'm particuIarly happy with something, I have a tendency to let criticism put me in such a black mood that I'm unable to continue. And blocks happen all the time! <BR> <BR>The old standbys help: mow the lawn, wash the dishes, go for a drive or a walk, putter aimlessly with a personal, pet project. Ideas seem to come best when you're not trying, not trying to &quot;work.&quot; <BR> <BR>I know what you mean by not being satisfied.

		<div class="commentbody">Mr. Tom Christensen, grazie, writing that &quot;nothing is perfect&quot; <BR>you made me think that the problem is not if there's or not <BR>something perfect &ndash; in typographic design as well as under <BR>other human perspectives &amp; relations. <BR>This link is interesting <a href="http://seeing.nypl.org/" target="_blank"><a href="http://seeing.nypl.org/">http://seeing.nypl.org/</a></a> <BR>but would you dare to say that God is not perfect? <BR>It is also interesting to note that the actual Greek root <BR>of the word 'problem,' namely, 'probalein,' means 'to throw' <BR>or 'to thrust forward.'  <BR>Problems are the very means by which God drives us forward. <BR>Without problems, there would be no growth. <BR>So, the problem is not if something is &quot;not perfect:&quot; <BR>I'd advice to try hard to seek for where and when to act. <BR>I'm saying that if you love a flower which is upon a star <BR>then the night is gonna be sweet, looking at the sky. <BR>AS <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/42688.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I myself have gone through a major depression due to my obssesive nature about design,typography and life. So much so, that all sense of rationale and logic was lost in my wee little brain. I was forced, by my own mind, to stop designing all together(and go fishing <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> ). Once I did that, the design bug came back to bite me in the  a year later. I learned a great deal about myself when I was depressed. The main thing I realized is that I am sad some days and happy others. As I have gotten  a little older I have learned to embrace the depression. I feel sad when I am sad. I feel happy when I am happy. Don't suppress your feelings. Breathing (and Design) ultimatey will make you feel alive. Alive doesn't have to be happy or sad it can be both&hellip;.Enjoy both. This is just my personal expierience. Everyone is different, but judging from this thread, alot of us are the same. Let pain and joy guide you simultaniously.  All the best <BR> <BR>DG</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Currently a little of both. I work full time <BR>(Not a great job) and do as much freelance as I can. Profit or non-profit. It doesn't matter to me just as long as I am doing what I love&hellip;.Thinking and designing. If I don't have projects to do, I make them up. There are many people out there who will can benefit from good design. If they can't find you, GO FIND THEM. Practice effeciency. It's better to make any  decision (good or bad) than no decision. Go out and find something that looks like s**t and redesign it. Why not! If you don't finish, so what! At least you are keeping your mind active and alive. <BR> <BR> <BR>When it comes to your identity here is a trick. <BR> <BR>Think of it as though you are designing an identity for someone you met who is exactly like you. Sounds strange but hopefully it might help you look at it from a different angle. It did for me.</div>

Of course before there were yin and yang there was the undifferentiated tao, and ji pervades all. <BR> <BR>On the subject of whether God is perfect, consider this passage from the NY Times, which suggests that we may in fact be inhabiting a universe of one of the lesser gods (sorry to sidetrack the conversation, but this is too remarkable a quote to pass up). The context is a campaign appearance by Bush in Florida: <BR> <BR><i>In Niceville, Mr. Bush's appearance took on the air of a revival meeting as the audience chanted affirmation to his description of the rationale for his antiterror efforts and roared at any religious reference. Gary Walby, a resident of nearby Destin, told the president during a question-and-answer session that though he always voted Republican, &quot;this is the very first time I felt God was in the White House.&quot;</i> <BR> <BR>(But don't get depressed.

Step out of &quot;psychoanalitic&quot; language and in general you'll see it's a signal of needed internal growth. <BR> <BR>I don't want to sound superficial: almost all the few typefaces I have on sale (except the initial Ottomat, in part, and the latter Ogilve) were designed in a constant state of disgust and continuous doubt. As I was working of them (and in many moments I gave up) they seemed just worthless and ugly. <BR>Only after regaining balance I became able to look at them objectively, and see what was good in them. <BR> <BR>My only advice (which is probably the best I always received from many people) is to finish each thing you start, no matter how ugly or senseless it may seem. <BR>It's not easy (I'm rarely able to do so myself) but it's the only way to reacquire a critical perspective.</div>

People come in wanting &quot;business cards printed&quot;. Totally unaware of design. I could just slap something up, shudder and print it. But it is much more exciting trying to explain in 5 mins or less what I can do that is much better. It might cost a little more, but the business card will be better for it. I feel like this is the front line, as it were. Sometimes I get waverings of depression thinking &quot;Garrgh, no-one cares!&quot; but choose to ignore it and get stuck in. I like the challenge of severe time restraints now, quoting and charging accurately are very interesting. I was also afraid that my type desiging time will get eaten into, but have decided to do some of my proofs on small signage jobs! Pretty cheeky, but I reckon it will be effective.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey everyone, thank you so much for you insight. It has been helping me quite a bit. Now if you can give your insoght on a personal desigh project, it would be greatly appreciated. I am currently designing a buiseness card for myself. It includes simple yet elegant type letterpressed on 100 percent cotton card stock. Now the design element I want to incorporate is the use of custom made rubber stamps of some of my &quot;type&quot; specimens and artwork. Since I will make several rubber stamps I'll have a few unique cards I can distribute to clients. I feel this will give the design a feeling of individuality and imagination. And if I ever get tired of a specific image I can just have new rubbrestamps made. What do you think?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ivan &ndash; some words of advice from an abuelo who has been involved in every way to get ink and color on paper for 55 years. My late colleague and fellow member of the National Cartoonists Society, Charles Schulz, suffered from severe depression despite the fact that he made the Forbes list of the richest people in the world. Clinical depression is a medical condition that should be treated.  Occasional depression is something else. Perhaps we take ourselves too seriously at times and that we should find ways to lighten up. I'm sure Mr. Lozos, who was in Vietnam would agree, that there are so many more opportunities to enjoy life when one isn't being shot at. Even then, things could always be worse, no matter the present situation. Descartes, a brilliant mind of the enlightened 17th century, said: I think,  therefore I am. It may sound trite to you but it works. I hope this helps. Good luck. <BR>PG <BR><a href="http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/" target="_blank"><a href="http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/">http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/</a></a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; what was a lowpoint? <BR> <BR>Losing electricity halfway into writing a program on my C64? I guess not. Worse still was when the fighting was so bad around our building that we'd have to go down to the bomb shelter. Usually I could convince my parents that we were essentially safe in this central room in our 6th floor apartment*, but I remember the time my mother went to the kitchen to get some hot water for tea, and the light from the candle she was holding attracted an RPG straight into the laundry room next to the kitchen. We all ran to her, she was OK, but then a second one hit the division between our floor and the lower floor - basically half a meter higher and we would of all been toast. We were all deaf for a few minutes. Then my father glared at me and said &quot;We're going down to the shelter now&quot;&hellip; But that was just a bit frightening, not a &quot;lowpoint&quot;. The major lowpoint was when a close uncle got assasinated. His son recently wrote a great book, though - I highly recommend it: <BR><a href="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/0743222830.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/0743222830.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg">http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/0743222830.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg</a></a> <BR> <BR>* Some of my best work painting D&amp;D miniatures was done by candle-light in that room, with Kalashnikovs and mortars raging in the neighborhood, with the beautiful, primordial prayers from the mosques blasting to encourage the fighters. <BR> <BR>My theory is that you miss <i>anything</i> that happened during your childhood. And if your childhood was messed up, that simply results in you having a messed up sense of what's healthy. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
