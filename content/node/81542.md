body: "Vintage metal oil cans are much better than today's plastic oil cans like many
  other old things! It is more powerful, more impressive, more iconic. These days,
  the relatively few metal oil cans that survived that familiar pattern have become
  collectibles. These cans not only served as containers, they also gave oil companies
  one more opportunity to advertise their brand name and logo. These vintage cans
  are also really good source for reflecting power of  <a href=\"http://www.antreposhop.com/product/public-gothic-font-family\"

    up here was Esso and Mobil, followed by BP and Shell.'
