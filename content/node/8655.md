body: Okay, this one won&#39;t be so fun, sorry. I know that the font is Fournier,
  but I&#39;d like to know if there are any good digital versions of this font. Thanks
  for your help!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/62971.gif" alt="Fournier">

    library though. ;&#41;

    &#34;Fournier Geperlt&#34; is called Dresden in the same reference. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    not aware of any digitizations.'

  body: I have a version also called June &#40;an American name for Pierre Simon Fournier
    le jeune [the younger, like Junior]&#41;. It was derived from a copy issued by
    Deberney &amp; Peignot in 1913, digitized by Alan Prescott &#40;who used to have
    a type shop in NYC&#41;. It has capitals, ampersand, numbers and punctuation &#40;but
    no parentheses&#41;. I&#39;m willing to send it out &#40;Mac Type 1 -- will need
    Stuffit Expander&#41; to you, Paul, over this weekend if you contact me by email.

    getting a free copy somewhere.

  body: this is part of a group of fonts given to me by Prescott for my Babel Press
    Type Index &#40;which still has to be printed!&#41; <BR> <BR>just felt like sending
    it to someone who cares <BR> <BR>I entered my email address last time, but I don&#39;t
    know if it&#39;s visible to you -- I don&#39;t see it on my posting <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    still very new to all this forum stuff and email in general -- you can tell me
    what to do in reaching you &#40;I mentioned the type of font and Stuffit because
    I did manage to send a bunch of Ric Mueller&#39;s fonts to TypOasis for inclusion
    on that site&#41;
