  body: ' I can only justify one magazine subscription: The New Yorker. I used to
    subscribe to Metropolis but I became irritated with it over time. It&#39;s primarily
    an architectural magazine and has nice, enormous pages - but it doesn&#39;t use
    all that paper real estate for big photographs. Instead it&#39;s all designery
    in that it uses white space profusely - and while I normally advocate more white
    space than less, in this case it&#39;s just plain wrong. Rather than fill the
    pages with big pictures where you can see the detail there are far too many instances
    where the pictures accompanying articles are no bigger than thay would have been
    if the magazine was normal tabloid size. It really seems a terrible waste of that
    large format to me. '
