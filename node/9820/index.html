<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Bit of a problem at my job. <br> <br>We produce hangtags, warranty booklets and other related <br>printed materials for Samsonite. Multi-lingual texts including <br>Eastern European, Greek and Cyrillic are sent to us which <br>we have to lay-out on in QuarkXPress on Mac. <br>These multi-lingual texts were input on PC using unicode <br>fonts, most probably Arial MS Unicode. <br> <br>So we have a multiple problem. <br> <br>First, we have no other option but to migrate to inDesign CS, <br>as QXP doesn't support Unicode until the bug-infested and <br>bankrupcy inducing version 7 is released in 2008 or so. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>Second, we need Helvetica (as prescribed by the Samsonite <br>style manual) in Rg, Ob, Bd and BdOb weights as a Unicode <br>font. I found a Linotype Pro version including everything I <br>need at MyFonts, but when I double-checked the fonts on the <br>Linotype site it looked as if in some instances Greek and in <br>other both Greek and Cyrillic were <i>not</i> included. <br> <br>Can anybody confirm that this version of Helvetica is indeed <br>a Unicode font including Easter European, Cyrillic and Greek, <br><i>not as separate add-on fonts.</i></div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>MyFonts has a popup menu where you can select showings. There should be a Cyrillic and a Greek choice in the menu. I think they are limited in the number of characters they can show at once so that when you select "all" you get the typical western glyph set.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yves, you need <b>Helvetica Linotype</b>. This is a family of four OpenType fonts. The four weights available are just the ones you need (the "italics" are only obliques). <br> <br>Each of the fonts has Western Latin and Extended European (CE, Baltic, etc.), Greek, and Cyrillic characters, as well as Hebrew and Arabic. You can read the code page info in the description at the bottom of this page: <a href=http://www.linotype.com/48344/helveticalinotype-family.html target=_blank>http://www.linotype.com/48344/helveticalinotype-family.html</a> <br> <br>You can also purchase the fonts there, too ;-) <br> <br>Helvetica Linotype was released in 2002</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'll just note that the design of the Cyrillic and Greek letters in Helvetica Linotype differs very considerably from the earlier Helvetica Cyrillic and Greek designs (the latter from the 1970s, not sure about the Cyrillic). When Linotype approach me about making a version of Helvetica for use as core fonts in software systems, I recommended redesigning the Cyrillic and Greek, and was very happy when Linotype okay'd the budget for this. It should also be noted that Helvetica Linotype was completely respaced (Latin too), because the older Helvetica fonts (and the Helvetica Pro fonts that are based on them) had inherited 18-unit spacing from earlier font formats, so had inconsistent sidebearings. This is important to note, because you won't get the same line-layout between the Helvetica Pro fonts and the new Helvetica Linotype. So if you have existing documents set in the old Helvetica fonts and don't want them to reflow, you should avoid using the new font for that text. So, for instance, you might find that you end up using the Helvetica Pro fonts for Latin text and Helvetica Linotype only for the Cyrillic and Greek.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yves, I'm not sure if any of the other Helvetica versions can solve your problems in four single fonts. <br> <br><i>(The following is not an official statement)</i> For instance, from what I can tell from the Linotype webshop, <a href=http://www.linotype.com/12753/neuehelvetica55roman-font.html target=_blank>Neue Helvetica Pro</a> fonts have Western Latin and CE character sets in them, but not Greek or Cyrillic. <br> <br>The OpenType fonts in the <a href=http://www.linotype.com/13446/helveticaroman-font.html target=_blank>Helvetica</a> family on the other hand are different. <b>Std</b> seems to have Cyrillic characters in the character set, but no CE. The surperbly hinted <b>Com</b> version has Latin Extended characters, which include CE glyphs but not Cyrillic ones. <br> <br>If text flow issues would be a problem, and you don't think that Helvetica Linotype would be the best solution, I would recommend sending an e-mail to Linotype customer service, at <a href=mailto:info@linotype.com>info@linotype.com</a>. If you tell them exactly what your requirements are, they should be able to give you all of the definitive answers you would need. Additionally, you can call them up if e-mail isn't your thing. Info on that <a href=http://www.linotype.com/10-53-10/contactdetails.html target=_blank>here</a>. <br> <br>I should add that, whenever anyone has questions about Linotype fonts, e-mailing the company support address (<a href=mailto:info@linotype.com>info@linotype.com</a>) is always the best way to get information. It is faster</div>

<div class=commentbody>Actually, Dan's remark is quite interesting - does anybody feel <br>that my question was "misplaced" (to use too strong a word)? <br> <br>One might indeed argue that I had better asked the question <br>directly to tech support at Linotype.

<div class=commentbody>Yves, your question wasn't misplacesd at all. I just have to point out that for 100%-accurate info about any foundry's fonts, that foundry would be the best source. This isn't marketing spin; I am not a customer service rep, and I can make mistakes, too. <br> <br><i>The only reason I asked here was because I deemed the information as found on MyFonts and the Linotype website confusing.</i> <br> <br>This is why companies have customer service <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> . Plus, I don't think that Helvetica Linotype is for sale on MyFonts at the moment. <br> <br>I think that Typophile is the best source on the internet for opinion and information exchange about typography. This is a great place to ask "what is the best font for this job" or "what are the roots of xxx typeface's design" or even "what is the future of OpenType application support?" <br> <br>But the best place to find out whether or not a speciific character range is in a given commercial font is from the distributors themselves. This information is constantly changing. On a forum, you could get inaccurate advice, and then waste or lose time and money. And that would be sad. It would be great if every foundry would have their customer service reps surf typophile and other web forums around the clock to always dispense accurate information. Unfortuantely, this isn't the case at the moment, and a lot of info comes from individuals whose hearts are in the right place, but who may not be aware of certain little details in every case.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>I just have to point out that for 100%-accurate info about any foundry's fonts, that foundry would be the best source.</i> <br> <br>Unless the person who actually made the font in question happens to be available, in which case you can probably get 110% accurate info, since the foundry seldom knows all the decisions that went into making the font, unless they made it internally. Even then, if the person who actually worked on the project leaves the company, typically some knowledge departs with him.</div>
