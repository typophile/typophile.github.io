  seem to find much via Google. I know he's a London-based designer and has quite
  an eye for custom lettering and type-logos.\r\n\r\nThis is about the largest collection
  of his work I've found: \r\nhttp://www.wehaveaproblem.com/exhibitions/drury/trustmelondon.html
  \r\n\r\nand I have the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Futura/dp/1861541341/sr=8-1/qid=1172775004/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-8102982-7102227?ie=UTF8&s=books\">Futura
  </a> book he designed (which if you haven't seen, is excellent.)"
