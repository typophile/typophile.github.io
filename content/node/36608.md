body: I would like to find a bold typeface that includes the lower case greek characters
  alpha, beta, gamma and delta that would pair well with Helvetica Bold. Helvetica
  Greek Monotonic Bold almost fits the bill, however the "alpha" and "gamma" don't
  look enough like greek symbols when mixed in with non-greek text (they look too
  much like a and y). This is for a scientific publication.

  body: if the EULA allows for it, hire a professional to make the mods you need!
    i added a few phonetic characters to a set of typefaces that a friend wanted to
    use in a project for a client, i think she was happy with the result. :^)

    I don't think Helvetica's EULA allows for modification. :^/"

  body: "This is so weird...\r\nThe Linotype EULA does NOT allow for modifications,
    but (I believe) if licensed through Adobe the Adobe EULA applies, which DOES allow
    for modifications. Of course, i am no legal counsel. You might want to check with
    the proper authorities beforehand if this is the route you choose."

  body: Or, you could get someone to design from scratch a custom font with just the
    Greek symbols you need to match the Helvetica you are using. This would avoid
    the EULA issues associated with trying to modify an existing version of Helvetica.
    There is no reason to start from existing Greek versions of Helvetica, which are
    aimed at recreating the shapes of the Latin letters of Helvetica as much as possible,
    since the Greek letters would be used as scientific symbols and it is actually
    desirable to distinguish them from the Latin letters of Helvetica.

  body: Adobe's EULA only applies to Adobe Originals (and some of the Berthold Fonts,
    I think). Or something like that. Thomas will come along a sweep up after me if
    I'm not correct.

  body: "Thanks for the helpful posts; it's a bit over my expertise (comfort zone?)
    to get custom modifications. How much would 3 characters cost? Where would I go?
    \r\n\r\nI did find one way to scan for greek characters in multiple fonts at once.
    On my Mac (OS10.4), I opened Character Palette> View> All Characters> European
    Scripts> Greek, and then the drop down menus Font Variation. I was able to find
    a pretty good bold alpha in one of the Asian collections. If there's a way to
    do this with fonts that you haven't yet purchased/downloaded, I'm still interested
    in learning of that kind of trick. "
