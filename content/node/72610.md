  used to be rendered before CT, is it mostly like CT,\r\nor something else? I'm also
  wondering how it handles hinting,\r\nsubpixels, X-versus-Y smoothing, etc. Thanks.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nAs for comparison with CT, there is subpixel rendering: here's the font
    settings window on my Ubuntu box:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freetype_5029.png]\r\n\r\nIs
    that kinda the direction in which you're asking?"

    Greyscale and Quartz rendering of some fonts I've been working on. I'm not home
    until later this evening, so I'll check back then.

  body: Also, Typekit has screenshots of different browsers on different OS's for
    each font. The browsers all add their own flavor, but if you know which is which
    renderer (see this forum somewhere) it may give you a general idea ...
