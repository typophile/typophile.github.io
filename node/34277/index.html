  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m designing an 20&rsquo;s style art deco-ish cd and I&rsquo;m thinking about using either silver ink or spot varnishing, but I&rsquo;ve never really done something like this so I come to you guys for advice.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The cd for a musical based on the life of Peter Lorre. The cover art concept I was given is a play on an old grayscale poster of one of his movies with a dash of red thrown in. Since this was all we had at the beginning, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about printing it in Black, PMS135 &amp; Silver ink and have done my design so far in a way that could be converted to that. I posted <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a sample spread<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (in progress! don&rsquo;t critique too much!)</p>
<p>I was inspired by the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Spider &amp; the Fly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) children&rsquo;s book which states it was printed in a black &amp; silver duotone, but I&rsquo;m not sure quite what I&rsquo;d want to do with it.</p>
<p>When I went back to look at this book again, the effect wasn&rsquo;t as impressive as I thought. This got me thinking about spot varnishes. The look we&rsquo;re going for in the booklet is very rich black, lots of gradients multiplied over gradients, angular, art deco.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of just me doing this, at least on the art direction side and since I&rsquo;ve never done &ldquo;special inks&rdquo; I&rsquo;d like to get other ideas or experiences. If we go with silver, would it be worth it? How noticeable would it be? If I do spot varnishes, where would I do them? The song titles? The black boxes? In different boxes to add another layer of fun confusion? What sort of spot varnish treatments have you loved? I really want this to look great and not just like some black ink on paper and I&rsquo;m really flying solo in all these ideas because none of the other people I&rsquo;m talking to/working with can envision it&hellip;so thank you all in advance for at least letting me bounce ideas off of you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>you could use both silver and the spot varnish if you wanted. it still works out cheaper than having it printed in cmyk. just make sure you dont have a matte finish on the silver cuz that just looks like grey.</p>
<p>another option you could have is inverting the whites and blacks on your design to accomodate the silver spot varnish. which looks like blue/light-grey when printed onto white.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There was a discussion about using spot varnishes awhile ago that I was trying to find, but couldn&rsquo;t, even going through Google.  hrumph.</p>
<p>I like using spot varnishes (semi-gloss, on matte paper) over B/W photos to give that almost-sepia look: it&rsquo;s very effective when done properly (i.e., the varnish exactly matches the edges of the photo) and reasonably priced.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know if varnishing it helps. I guess if you want matte parts on glossy paper, you can print it with matte/satin varnish, but that I have never tried out.</div>

<p>The new Metal F/X proprietary software may be another answer, if your printer has a license. Though I think that may be only for four-color work. (I&rsquo;ve only had occasion to use it once, and it was on a four-color piece.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Okay, I was running late. I thought I should phone one of my favorite printers (one that has the Metal F/X license) to follow up on what I suggested in an earlier post. My printer&rsquo;s rep confirmed that Metal F/X only works with 4-C process, so that won&rsquo;t work, and then suggested printing on a silver paper. So we discussed silver papers and I got all excited and posted that. Then buggered off to my &ldquo;previous commitment&rdquo;, which incidentally was an Open House at a local paper merchant. Halfway to the warehouse I realized that Tim had already suggested the silver paper technique. And now I&rsquo;m feeling particularly stoopid, &lsquo;cause I had read Tim&rsquo;s post and thought he was offering good and sage advice, but in my excitement to report on what the printer&rsquo;s rep said, I completely forgot Tim&rsquo;s earlier post.</p>
<p>However, while at the paper merchant&rsquo;s Open House I found another stock that would work swimmingly for your project: Wausau Paper&rsquo;s Chalice Silver 70 pound Text. As silvery as silver can be.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow, I&rsquo;m really appreciating all this advice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how much choice I have over the stock. I think we might be going with one of those &ldquo;we do everything&rdquo; CD manufacturers who have a standard stock (a &ldquo;100lb gloss coated stock&rdquo; according to their FAQ, and an &ldquo;80lb uncoated text stock&rdquo;. )</p>
<p>Ken or Tim, do you know if I would be able to get samples from the paper company? We&rsquo;re actually running pretty tight on this (art is due next thursday, a week from today) so I&rsquo;d need them very quickly and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to do it sight unseen.</p>
<p>How would red print over silver?</p>
<p>Thanks Linda, that sort of example is very helpful. I&rsquo;d be fine with doing 4c and just printing in a rich black but then I&rsquo;d want to do spot varnishes&hellip;and I think I need more inspiration for using them in creative ways.</p>
<p>How would it look if every piece of text had a varnish over it? Would that be incredibly hard to read? Is it a bad idea?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Brian, I agree with Tim about the varnish not being a great idea on text: if anything, I&rsquo;d varnish the entire piece except the text, so that the contrast would make it stand out.</p>
<p>And, of course, there are other places where it can be used effectively, such as instead of some sort of embosssing, a logo over an otherwise &ldquo;plain&rdquo; background, etc.  As always in cases like  this, talk to your printer rep, and they can provide excellent suggestions (well, mine always does!).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I stay away from silver ink now unless it is a large swath - It just ends up looking white or gray. Silver foil, however, is wondeful. But I don&rsquo;t white see how it applies to this design and foil is a lot more expensive.</p>
<p>The idea about printing on metallic stock seems like the best one here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen text with spot varnish over it - it&rsquo;s a nice effect but it definitely affects the legibility. In looking at this layout it doesn&rsquo;t seem like legibility is your first concern (no offense intended). It will be tough to get perfect alignment on all this text, especially the thinner deco typeface.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Brian: to get paper samples fast, talk to your printer. They probably have a cabinet full of samples and swatchbooks. (Or check your local paper merchant.) They&rsquo;ll also know if any of the papers are readily available. I don&rsquo;t know why they wouldn&rsquo;t be available to you. Shine is a product of Reich Paper, headquartered in Brooklyn. Wausau Paper is headquartered in Wisconsin. They both have websites (www. company name including the word &ldquo;paper&rdquo; as one word .com for both) but I find getting a feel for paper off a website is very difficult.</p>
<p>Tim: I used Metal F/X for the dust jacket of a photography book. Design was a very large photograph letterboxed with a fifth color (a warm grey) chosen to complement the palette of the photo. Client decided, at the last minute of course, to change the fifth color to their corporate color (basicly reflex blue with bit of magenta). I didn&rsquo;t like the new color combination and was bitching to the printer, who suggested that Metal F/X would bring the tonal range of the photo and the corporate color closer. It worked great as a compromise. Photo-Boy was okay with metallic sheen and changed color palette of his photo. Client agreed the metallic sheen was pretty, even though it wasn&rsquo;t his corporate color anymore.</p>
<p>Lex: Sorry, buddy. Didn&rsquo;t realize you were into paper. I&rsquo;ll let you know next time.</p>

How much would this affect the legibility of what’s underneath? Would the secret text have to be really big to be readable?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It would certainly have to be larger than ordinary text, and heavier, but not too heavy. I woldn&rsquo;t suggest going smaller than a 12pt medium weight. And there of course would have to be a significant step between the varnish gloss and the paper finish.</p>
<p>You could also add texture with thermographic embossing, using the clear varnish as glue for the powder (instead of ink as is usually done). I&rsquo;ve seen this done on packaging before. It&rsquo;s a pretty neat effect.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Paul, as good as that sounds, it&rsquo;s a little too much, especially since we have to cram a lot on there so it&rsquo;s gonna be tough to understand as it is.</p>
<p>Cuttle, For the secret messages, I was thinking really big, like 24pt or so. And by significant step, you mean in terms of brightness right? not like a production step of drying or sealing or something.</p>
<p>Spoke with the printer, he said they have this new technology called &ldquo;One Shot&rdquo; that ends up being extremely similar to Spot UV but at a fraction of the cost. He&rsquo;s UPSing me samples I&rsquo;ll have tomorrow.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Oh yeah, 24pt should be no problem. By &ldquo;significant step&rdquo; I meant in terms of relative sheen between the paper surface and the varnish. It would be somewhat useless to print your secret messages in matte varnish on matte stock, or in gloss varnish on glossy coated stock. But that all depends on just how &ldquo;secret&rdquo; you want your messages to be.</div>
