    CG, but not nearly as fun as <a href=\"http://cbgb.net/\" target=\"new\">CBGB</a>!\r\n\r\nAnd
    look who's using the old CompuGraphic name... <a href=\"http://www.compugraphic.com/\"
    target=\"new\">www.compugraphic.com</a>."

  body: When we purchased our first imagesetter -- AGFA 9550 -- we were also giving
    our choice of the AGFA type library and I had a blast choosing the typefaces.

    this font easy to get?\r\n\r\nAny luck on the \"EGG\" part?"

  body: "Many of the \"CG\" designated designs had a bad rap during the eighties and
    not all of them were purely \"look-alikes\".\r\n\r\nThere were some that we used
    original source specimens and developed \"revivals\" of metal cuts. In fact, during
    the late eighties, Ren\xE9 Kerfante (Monotype Managing Director of the Typography
    Division) mentioned to me that in his opinion, CG's first release of Schneidler
    was one of the better versions.\r\n\r\nThis is only mentioned here in passing
    as an historic reference to \"CG\" and not intended to open any discussion regarding
    clones, revivals and historic type pirating. Let's leave that stuff for another
    thread and time. :-)"

  body: EGG reminds me of Roxy from Font Bureau with a little altering. Although,
    if HUNT is Bernard you are looking for something older. You could also use Mark
    Simonson's Blakeley for a close match.

      looks like 'Hunt' to me."
