body: 'There have been two threads here recently that have both excited and intrigued
  me, and have subsequently caused me to contemplate Typophile&#39;s forums and the
  dialogue of design&#40;ers&#41; in general. <BR> <BR>The &#34;who wouldn&#39;t you
  work for&#34; thread and the CBS memos thread in both cases led to very interesting
  dialogues about porn and politics.  I was inspired and challenged by the myriad
  of mostly well articulated opinions on these &#39;tangents&#39;.  I learned.  I
  honed my thoughts because of your thoughts. There was an exchange. <BR> <BR>But
  in both of these threads, and in many online communities, there is this fear/impoliteness
  of getting off topic.  Clearly, in non-virtual dialogue we don&#39;t do this.  I
  don&#39;t stop someone from discussing the perils of the porn industry just because
  we were talking about something else.  So why do we make this caveat here at typophile
  &#40;or other online communities&#41;?  Is it because this doesn&#39;t relate to
  design?  If you say yes to that, then I ask what if anything doesn&#39;t relate
  to design? <BR> <BR>I am immediately reminded of a quote I came across from Bruce
  Mau: <BR> <BR>&#34;Design takes on a social dimension. I think the most positive
  expression of this new ambition for design is the embrace of sustainability in design
  practice.  To incorporate the complex process of resolving ecological, social, and
  economic factors in the practice of design takes design out of any claim to rarefication
  or exclusivity.  It places it within the messy flow of public discussion...design
  is absolutely a political project.&#34; <BR> <BR>So in a way I would hope that attaching
  bezier curves, helvetica bashing, and leading can lead to discussions about the
  grander layout of things.  What do we gain from having insular discussions especially
  when their is potentially something we can learn from each other.  And in the end
  it might even inform our next design project.'

  body: Peter, I know you must think I&#39;m the bad guy after the CBS rant I posted
    last week. &#40;For which I am sorry&#41; I think &#34;off topic&#34; is how it
    goes. Life is an education and I don&#39;t wish to be a one-sided/one-dimensional
    person.

    <BR> <BR>just seems that we are pretty intelligent folks, and have a lot to share

  body: Designers are to our information age what engineers were to the age of steam,
    what scientists were to the age of reason. They set the mood of the mental environment.
    They create the envy and desire that fuels the economy and cynicism that underlies
    our postmodern condition. <BR> <BR>Kalle Lasn, Director of the Media Foundation,
    from Adbusters, 1999. <BR> <BR>----------------------- <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to
    see more debate about off topic stuff on typophile, designers should have opinions.

  body: I go off-topic more than average &#40;and usually in a certain known direction...&#41;
    but I still have to state that focus is important, and so is self-discipline.
    Nothing exists in a vacuum, and I tend to link everything together&#42; and enjoy
    discussing the contexts of things. On the other hand, since we&#39;re not Ancient
    Greek philosophers in togas, and we want to actually <i>make</i> stuff, we do
    need to respect the fact that nobody can grasp and discuss everything, and trying
    to do so is counterproductive and ultimately does not make [most] people happy.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; Even tenuous things. I recently justified my interest in reviving
    a lost authenticity to Cyrillic partly by noting that Russia and Armenia conduct
    joint military exercises. Everybody is responsible for everything, just to different
    degrees. <BR> <BR>hhp
