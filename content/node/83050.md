  body: This is a great video that explains the anatomy of a computer virus. Having
    problems with computer viruses at work can cause the company to lose money because
    it is downtime during the day. It's always good to have a company that specializes
    in <a href="http://mytek.biz/it.php">network support phoenix</a> because then
    you will always have support with computer issues. That way, they will be taken
    care of right away to avoid losing the company money. Thanks for sharing the great
    video.
