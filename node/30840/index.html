<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi everyone,
I'm presenting a few logo concepts to a client tomorrow. The logo is for a local music-venue and bar called "the bottleneck." They book punk, indie, rockabilly, etc. and wanted a rustic, beat-down, Midwestern look. My inspiration was old letterpress ephemera you see in the area.
What do you think? Please feel free to point out specific flaws as well as your general feeling and which one is your favorite. I could use all the help I can get!
p.s.-- ignore the fact that none of them say "The". Thanks!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Strongest current directions are Upper Right and Bottom Left. The marks feel somewhwat unbalanced: try getting rid of the blocks behind the Upper Right logo, and kerning the N closer to the B. Also, this may be due to personal taste, but I find the exclamation point to be a tad cheesy (especially in a logo). If they're drawing Indie acts, the exclamation will on serve to compromise the audience's perception of the venue (and their ability to pull legitimate shows).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, thanks Vince, but honestly I want them to continue to hire me for all their graphics needs. Those are awesome posters though!
Thanks for the critique, JS! I don't think they're having any problem booking shows with the current AWFUL logo they have, but they are hoping to bring back the hippest kids who have moved on to other venues as their identity has started to age and look 90's. I'll play around with the tweaks you suggested.
Anyone else?

<div class=commentbody>Hey Jeff,
for what it's worth, I think it's a good concept, I think the blocky ones on the right are definitely stronger, the letter-press look is more obvious, the others have a bit more of the ransom note thing happening, ot as desirable ;) I have two suggestions:
1. integrate the B more, I just keep seeing the capital B, it's really dominant and everything else fades into a block. I think it's OK to lead with it but at the moment it seems to be doing its own thing. B square.
2. Very clean looking letters for letterpress... without going grunge crazy, I would imagine a bit of dirtying it up wouldn't go astray, nothing wrong with a few printing artifacts, it's a rock and roll club, subtlety isn't so much required.
Finally, I'm not so sure about the 3dness of the letters, might be a little too busy for a logo, I hope these thoughts help, like I say, fair enough concept that will look good with just a bit more work
cheers

<div class=commentbody>Thanks all,
nicholasgross:
1. I agree entirely. I'm hoping that when I add the "The" part I can integrate the B as part of that. I have some sketches, but it does need to be addressed.
2. Definitely part of the plan. I thought I'd show them just straight vector logo mock-ups for today's meeting but integrate a distressed look for the final. Thanks for the feedback!
aluminum: God I wish! They're too damn cheap. But I do think they'll hire a local GOOD sign painter for the exterior signage so that will be sweet. I'll upload pics when it is all said and done.
Thanks again! Anyone else?
