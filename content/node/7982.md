  body: the text is set in several weights of <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=AB800960X1P1&amp;start=1">Akzidenz
    Grotesk</a>, from the Company Who Shall Remain Nameless. <BR> <BR>the logo kinda
    looks hand drawn to me.

  body: I have looked up and down for similar typefaces and I think Metadox  <BR>is
    right - <i>The Incredibles</i> is most probably a custom designed logo.

  body: I agree with you guys that the logo is also custom, but for some reason I
    feel like if you condense <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=48&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=THE+INCREDIBLES&amp;search%5Btext%5D=ray%27s+cafe"
    target="_blank">Ray&#39;s Cafe</a> enough, cut it up and extend some of the letters
    a bit, and throw a <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/newport-classic-sg/regular/testdrive.html?s=THE+INCREDIBLES&amp;p=60"
    target="_blank">Newport Classic</a> letter S on the end of it you&#39;d get pretty
    close... <BR> <BR>... but that&#39;s the kind of answer you get when college-student
    Ryan gets up &#34;early&#34; on a Sunday morning.  My vote is still custom.
