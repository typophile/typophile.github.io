  and I&#39;m trying to figure out how to make this work: I am running Mac OS 9.1
  and have Suitcase 9. The font came in Open Type format and I don&#39;t know how
  to load it so I can access the full character set -- Suitcase doesn&#39;t recognize
  it at all and when I loaded it directly into the System folder the extra characters
  don&#39;t show up. Does anyone know how to do this? Thanks for any help you can
  give me.'

    I&#39;m not sure what the score is with Suitcase, but sticking the font in the
    &#34;Fonts&#34; folder in the system folder should load it. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re
    trying to use this font with XPress then forget it, it&#39;s not OT savvy. I think
    your choices are PhotoShop 7.0, Illustrator 10 or InDesign. If you aren&#39;t
    using those apps then you probably aren&#39;t going to get anywhere with extended
    characters - but the standard range should work with almost any app &#40;barring
    some versions of Illustrator - 6/7 I think&#41;.

  body: I am not sure you&#39;re right about Quark, Jim. I was told any <BR>application
    that can use a TT font can use an OT font - it&#39;s <BR>just that PS 7 and InD
    2 are the only apps to take advantage <BR>of the special features of OT. <BR>
    <BR>There&#39;s a difference between &#34;savvy&#34; and &#34;compatible&#34;.

  body: Thanks a lot for your help, guys. It looks like what you&#39;re saying about
    using Photoshop 7 or Illust. 10 is exactly right. Although it doesn&#39;t seem
    like these limitations are very clearly spelled out on Adobe&#39;s website. &#40;Let
    the buyer beware...&#41; <BR> <BR>Ah, technology, I love it so. Is it too late
    to go back to dry transfer lettering?

  body: 'There are three aspects to OpenType: the font format, the character encoding
    &#40;Unicode&#41;, and the layout intelligence &#40;OTL&#41;. Different systems
    and applications have different levels of support for these three aspects. Using
    the lastest versions of ATM, system font support or FreeType &#40;the latter mainly
    for Linux&#41;, most systems are capable of installing the font format and correctly
    rendering the outlines. <BR> <BR>Systems and applications with Unicode text processing
    will be able to access all encoded characters in the font. Applications with at
    least this level of support include all Windows NT/2000/XP apps, Cocoa apps on
    Mac OS X, some Adobe apps &#40;InDesign and PhotoShop&#41;. Applications that
    do not support Unicode text processing will only reveal an 8-bit subset of the
    encoded characters &#40;some may be able to reveal multiple subsets as if they
    were separate fonts&#41;. It should be noted that Quark Xpress does not support
    Unicode text processing. Neither does Illustrator, but it is considered quite
    likely that the next version will. <BR> <BR>Applications that support OpenType
    Layout provide access to unencoded glyphs in the font via OTL lookups and features.
    Note that not all applications will provide the same level of OTL support, and
    a font may contain features that are not yet accessible in your OTL-savvy app.
    Currently, InDesign and PhotoShop provide the best levels of OTL support for non-complex
    scripts. The Windows version of MS Office provides the best level of support for
    complex scripts.'

  body: Stephen, Troy&#39;s question was really &#34;how do I access the extended
    character set&#34;, and the answer is &#34;in Quark you can&#39;t&#34;. The situation
    is as I stated, nearly any app &#40;including XPress&#41; can use the standard
    &#40;8-bit&#41; character set, except &#40;specifically&#41; some versions of
    Illustrator &#40;which cannot use an OpenType font at all&#41;.
