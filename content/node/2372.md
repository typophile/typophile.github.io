body: I am currently working on setting a book, and wonder about a few typographic
  rules. The book is set in Norwegian, and I am not sure wheter specific rules apply
  to that specific language, however, any comment would be greatly appreciated. The
  question is, have the sentences been set with the right punctuation regarding the
  use of ellipsi and comma/period.  <BR> <BR>

  body: Oystein, in English there is no space between the preceding sentence and the
    ellipsis. <BR> <BR>And for you second question, we use a comma.

  body: 'Oystein: <BR> <BR>Well, I wouldn&#39;t do it that way. Are you also copyediting
    the book, or just laying it out? <BR> <BR>If you can change the verbage, I would
    phrase it thus: <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;s not that hard to notice,&#34; he continues.
    &#34;Just look at what you&#39;re wearing.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#40;Bearing in mind
    that Norwegian may be different than English when it comes to parsing sentences.&#41;'

  body: Thanks John, <BR> <BR>My main job is limited to layout, however I&#39;ll tell
    the author, since in my opinion, there&#39;s too many pauses made with ellipsis.  <BR>
