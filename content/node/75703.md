body: I'm redrawing some art that one of our customers lost. The image is from a scanned
  sample of the original art, but I can't figure out what font this is at all. I'm
  pretty sure the art was done a LONG time ago, if that helps narrow it down at all.
  Thanks in advance!

    though, I really like how tea chest looks. I think I'm going to try and fit it
    into a project as soon as it's appropriate.
