  body: "What's up with the \"rss\" always showing up instead of attachments? I reported
    the bug but it doesn't seem to have changed.\r\n\r\nBTW - TDD - Trajan is not
    derived from a metal type, it's a new font based on ancient Roman letterforms."

    it's not their logo, it's just one of the alphabets they offer. they call it "classic
    condensed roman." very specific, huh?

  body: The Crane logo is set in Goudy Trajan. You can tell that the ampersand is
    of a Goudy design.

  body: The orginal Monotype Goudy Trajan did not have an ampersand. Crane & Co. uses
    a Goudy Old Style ampersand. Look up the font and judge for youself. I am an old
    fart and I could be wrong.
