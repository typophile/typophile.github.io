  body: "Link, could you please explain why you singled out the B and didn't show
    us the complete logo? Frankly you made our lives quite a bit harder. ;^)\r\n\r\nIt
    is imperative for an identification that you provide us with as much information
    as possible. Trying to identify a typeface from a single letter is one of the
    hardest things to do, especially when it's a less typical character like a capital
    B."
