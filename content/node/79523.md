  body: Interestingly, Country and Surrey sport a different y. From where do the samples
    come?

  body: The samples came from photos I found on Flickr. Maybe Country and Surrey use
    different fonts?

  body: These are from the sides of buses. I'm not sure how old this design is. It
    was traditional for buses that ran in the then more rural areas around London
    to be green in contrast to the red London buses. Lots of [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/andysbusphotos/5266434153/in/pool-londoncountry#/photos/andysbusphotos/5266434153/in/pool-413301@N25/|London

  body: "You have two different fonts. Look at the y in London and Country and the
    one in Guildford and West Surrey.\r\nI think the Guildford one is actually Kabel...there
    are several different cuts of Kabel, was there something in particular that made
    you think it wasn't Kabel.\r\n\r\nAs for the other one, it is hard to say with
    the image resolution here. I thought it might be <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/agenda/\">FB
    Agenda</a> like the ones here in Brighton, (because the ampersand is in BQ Cosmos,
    which is also on the Brighton buses), but it isn't. "

  body: Why i thought it wouldn't be Kabel is because the dots on the lowercase "I"
    are round, not diamonds. Maybe these were custom lettering?? Thanks guys!
