I made this just as a general info for those uniformed.

It is simplified, but generally speaking these are main possible paths with default settings.

X axis is market share (with some guessing).

I know a small examples of renderings could be included for better understanding, and I will post this & other refinements later.

A few things not mentioned:
Linux with FreeType rendering, but I have no idea how many people use subpixel rendering or other settings. Each setting has probably less than 1% of users.
Quartz rendering does also other types than subpixel AA, but I would say they are in minority (I really don't know).
There is also an <em>old</em> version of Safari, with Quartz rendering on Windows with default setting.
Mobile market falls under Other, but some browsers aren't capable of displaying @font-face fonts anyway.
PS: I made this quickly, I hope there is no huge mistake that I can not see...

In IE6 and IE7, PS fonts cannot be served as EOTs, so the blue line to and from these browsers is misleading.</div>

It suggests that FF and Crome under XP do not do subpixel rendering at all; however, if CT is enabled in the system they do use it – maybe that could be reflected by a small comment in the left GDI box.</div>

The problem is that I have no data how many users actually change the defaults, and how.

There is also a type designer who has all control how to display TT-based font in Standard mode: when and if to display it aliased/greyscale.

Web designers haven't got a lot control, but they can force grayscale AA with CSS filters &ndash; CT enabled or not (in some browsers).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As John Hudson noted, both subpixel AA and positioning are important for smaller text sizes.  Windows GDI (and Uniscribe) only provide positioning information at pixel boundaries.  The DirectWrite API allows both better subpixel AA *and* subpixel positioning, plus font sizes can be any arbitrary size (GDI limits font size to integer units).

Compare this waterfall test on XP with a DirectWrite-enabled browser (IE9 beta or Firefox nightly with DirectWrite enabled):
http://people.mozilla.org/~jdaggett/tests/decimalfontwaterfalls-default.html

On the Mac and with DirectWrite browsers you'll see a nice smooth waterfall.

One thing to note is that Webkit browsers don't do subpixel positioning, even when kerning is enabled.  There's some odd code that repositions glyphs to pixel boundaries but hopefully that's just legacy code that will get fixed at some point.

Firefox4 will probably also use Cleartype rendering on XP, similar to IE7/8, with an option to revert to standard GDI.  That patch landed today, it'll be in the nightlies in the next day or so.

...and as proven as far back as 1987(!), at the bottom of any "smooth" waterfall, are a bunch of unreadable sizes. Readability down there at text sizes in low resolution comes from non-smooth waterfalls, (and it always will).

You're quite right.
Which is why all my test pages position the small text in the middle of the screen.
As is the case with <a href="http://eotfast.com">EOTFAST's</a> File Integrity Test Page.

Thanks for the info/analysis. Interesting.

Have you thought about putting your illustration on a t-shirt? Add some border radiuses maybe to mitigate the rectangularitis, put the illustration on the back of the shirt, and come up with a kewl catch-phrase of some kind for the front. It's a winner.</div>

And if you want to have a laugh and to confirm your point, here are the FreeType rendering  in use, depending on preference and what the vendor distributes. Some certainly below 1%.

		<div class="commentbody">Don't get me wrong. I think FreeType rendering is not only interesting, but sometimes quite good. But it may be a little while before FreeType rendering is any significant proportion of folks looking at web pages. I based my <1% comment on previous looks at stats from various web tracking services that claim to measure such things. Looking at the latest from NetMarketShare, they would claim about 1.7% for Linux and Java combined. Seems like StatCounter says something similar for Linux plus "Other." So I'd say that I probably understated it, but I have no doubt total FreeType usage is under 2%.

BTW, with these samples, it would be really helpful to explain what the various conditions mean and what causes them. What elements are controlled by user prefs, and what's their default? What elements are controlled by the vendor's choice(s)? What choices are the major vendors currently making?

		<div class="commentbody">Let’s not talk about percentages. Given the global number of people using the web, even one percent amounts to millions upon millions.

I’m glad to hear you’re interested. I’ll give you a fragmentary précis.

The FreeType library itself offers a range of render modes – each with tunable knobs – and among them some are disabled by <code>#ifdef</code> switches in the code. Some distributions compile those in and some don’t (for confused IP reasons I suppose).

For instance, <dl><dt>OpenSuSe</dt> <dd>disables both LCD filtering and bytecode hinting interpreter (default is 5th sample).</dd> <dt>Fedora</dt> <dd>does use an LCD filter by default but it only offers the legacy type that is intra-pixel and looks horrible with light hinting. Hence they need pixel-snapping and use sample 3 by default.<dd> <dt>Ubuntu</dt> <dd>found out through user polls and outright flamewars that light hinting (unhinted in x, autohinted in y-axis) combined with a newer signal-processing LCD filter is preferred by most. Hence their default font rasterization is sample 1.</dd> <dt>Android</dt><dd>I’m guessing from screenshots that they disable LCD filter and use light FreeType autohinter. Hence specimen 4.</dd><dt>monochrome is only used by maniacs</dt></dl>

This variance is compounded by the many ways to configure all the knobs – from config files (”.fonts.conf“) to high-level settings panels (”Best Shapes“, “Best Contrast”) – and the many different desktops and graphics libraries in use.

I’m assuming that browsers all obey the global desktop setting for their font rendering because if they didn’t they would be spammed with bug reports until they do. When it comes to taste and preference there are two dug-in camps. The ones who prefer the signal-processing look and the ones who hail from the olden Unix (or Windows) days and insist on pixel snapping or superhinting.

I think the former approach is the way forward, in particular because web fonts look good in it no matter what the format or feature set of the font is. The autohinter with the LCD filter is excellent, most robust, readable at small sizes and usable on scalable canvasses.

The only thing lacking at the moment is subpixel positioning. Still getting odd kerning in waterfalls and animations due to integer pixel effects.

These are the options exposed in the config file.
<code>
  antialias Bool Whether glyphs can be antialiased
  hinting   Bool Whether the rasterizer should use hinting
  hintstyle Int  Automatic hinting style: light, medium, full, none
  autohint  Bool Use autohinter instead of normal hinter
  rgba      Int  unknown, rgb, bgr, vrgb, vbgr, none - subpixel geometry

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">First, thank you for taking the time to explain some of the intricacies of FreeType's rendering options. Fascinating stuff!

I do think that knowing the relative numbers of users is important, and things such as their geographical distribution. For example, if we were looking at rendering of Chinese or Indic characters, I'd be looking at the relative use of different rendering in those regions, and I might have very different ideas about the importance of considering FreeType's rendering.

For what it's worth, I share your preferences for the new sub-pixel filter. I think I'd have to see a wider range of fonts and sizes before I would want to venture a preference between light and full auto-hinter, though.

Speaking of the auto-hinter, for other folks reading this thread, I think I should explain something in the background here that could otherwise confuse some of them (I know *you* know this, and so do many of the likely readers, but I doubt everyone is aware of it)... "hinting" means something slightly different in this context than it often does elsewhere.

At the broadest level, though, the meaning is consistent. "Hinting" is additional code, applied to an outline font, which influences or even controls what a rasterizer does when rendering the font outlines to pixels or dots.

In the classic usage, the hinting code is created as part of designing or compiling the font, and the hinting is an integral part of the font file.

But what FreeType does is to ignore any hinting code in the font file, automatically hint the font on the fly, and then use that new hinting as input to the rendering of the font. Given that the FreeType auto-hinting is better than that in many (probably most) fonts out there, the results are likely to be reasonable. Especially so given that FreeType's auto-hinting is presumably tuned to work as well as possible with FreeType's rasterizer.

This is an important distinction, because a lot of people who develop fonts or web font services hang out here. The main take-away for them is that with FreeType, the hinting in the font is irrelevant. What matters for FreeType is the nature of the design and the quality of the outlines.

I'd also be curious to see how equivalent outlines in perform in FreeType rendering when the variable is whether they are OpenType CFF vs TTF. That could be very interesting....

Regards,

T

P.S. (edit) I welcome any corrections if I have misunderstood what FreeType is up to.</div>

You are spot on with this insight. And it surprised me that [[http://design.canonical.com/2010/08/the-first-milestone/|just that work]] went into crafting the [[http://typophile.com/node/68016|next Ubuntu system font]].

The only two reasons I can think of for commissioning the hinting was to make sure that it would look acceptable cross-platform when used as a webfont on corporate and community websites (just the topic of this thread) and to please the few users savvy enough to edit config files and enable the formerly ”infringing“ TrueType byte-code interpreter.

No idea if that’s money well spent.

I would guess that TrueType and CFF fonts are rastered identically. Are there examples in the wild that are straight conversions that I could use?</div>

Linux libertine comes in both CFF and TTF flavoured, you may check it. I don't recall any difference in rendering between both, but I never paid close attention.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@towolf: I'd also be more than happy to do a quick conversion for you, of any open source font you care to name. Actually, I might do some outline attacks anyway, because what would be interesting to me would be to see if outlines optimized for a given outline format do any better than outlines just converted to that format. I'm thinking particularly what happens when one makes TTF from PS outlines without clean-up, or even (if one starts with non-cleaned-up TTF outlines) going the other direction.

Khaled’s suggestion was a good one since the fonts are only a download away.
Apparently there are some differences both in outlines and in kerning. I have no idea if that is due to the fonts themselves. I suppose the tool used is FontForge.

This should be animated at 1 Hz.:

And since this thread is about @font-face, here’s your blog both in 100% zoom and zoomed out (w/ Ctrl-Minus). Browser is Chromium 6. It certainly has worse font support than Mozilla at this point. In particular <code>text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;</code> where they enable kerning tables is kinda broken.

You can see how robust it is even at miniscule sizes.

Say what? With FreeType, the hinting in the font is as relevant as the FreeType implementation allows.

True... but are any of the major implementations using the bytecode interpreter? I have the impression (and I'm open to correction) that pretty much everybody these days is using some version of the autohinter tech.

>> What matters for FreeType is the nature of the design and the quality of the outlines.

I might have more clearly said "the only thing that matters" instead of "what matters" (that is, hinting doesn't matter). This is equally (or more) true for Apple's Quartz rendering. But we've covered that ground before on Typophile.

Of course the nature of the design and the quality of the outlines always matter for rendering and legibility. In the pre-ClearType and Mac Classic days one could use TT hinting to bend the outlines to one's will, but not so reliably today!

I think what you refer to is this: http://crbug.com/51973

I’m seeing span-like HTML elements that run into each other and overlap. It looks as if the calculation of the widths of those happen before the adjustment by kerning is taken into account (or vice versa). The thing is, a page reload usually fixes things. Could be a sporadic Heisenbug, or a race condition.

The most reliably broken page I’ve seen is one where the text block is unfolded by animation (again, fixed by toggling it):
