  body: "With no repeating characters it is impossible to tell if this is handdrawn
    or a font unless someone recognizes it. I'm guessing hand drawn.\r\n\r\nIt would
    help to know the source of your sample.\r\n\r\nAlso - you can do searches for
    fonts *like* this at myfonts.com, try searching for \"brush\" or \"handwriting\".
    You could also check out the Script ID guide (http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html)
    for something similar."

    'handdrawn' are a dime a dozen. Hard to tell \u2014 just wait till Dav is online,
    he's the greatest ; ) "
