  body: I have some problems with the initials, the D is too round and C too closed.
    If i squint my eyes it reads like almost as &#34;Oon Oorleone&#34;. <BR>The combination
    D-o looks tight.  <BR>Perhaps the upward stroke of &#34;l&#34; should join?  <BR>Perhaps
    the joining stroke between o and r could do a deeper &#34;dive&#34;? The large
    white space under the r looks a bit problematic. <BR> <BR> <BR>Even if I&#39;m
    complaining I like the overall feel a lot.

    is too wide. <BR>Ihana logo, mina rakastan muista safka :-&#41; <BR>Terveisin,

  body: I like it, and have no problem with the &#34;C&#34; but the lc &#34;r&#34;
    is odd. The initial &#34;D&#34; is nice but needs to have some extra appeal, it
    is too plain for being the initial letter, also it looks like a reflected &#34;C&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>Everything else is good for me.

  body: 'Thanks for the comments, it&#39;s just what I needed and you made good points
    in there. Your finnish-skills are pretty impressing Alessandro! <BR> <BR>I fixed
    the space between &#34;o&#34; and &#34;r&#34; and made the stroke between them
    dive a bit more and i think it works better now. <BR>Also fixed the &#34;D&#34;
    and the space after it. Here&#39;s the updated version: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/63052.jpg"

  body: Mikael <BR>I &#39;d try a version where lowercase &#34;l&#34; and &#34;e&#34;
    have a direct ligature with the character that has before but I m not so sure
    about the &#34;l&#34; <BR>Anyway I see that that you have &#34;C o r&#34; with
    more white space than &#34;corleone&#34;. I think the real problem is in the &#34;r&#34;
    <BR>Some of the inner forms like in the &#34;o&#34; will be not visible in small
    reductions oof the logo or in lowest print quality.  &#40;specially 2nd &#34;o&#34;&#41;.
    <BR>The left leg of the &#34;n&#34; is too close to the &#34;o&#34;  <BR>Sorry
    for the bad english <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
