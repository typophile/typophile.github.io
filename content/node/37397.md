    reason to avoid TrueType since 1998. And in this case you're making a logo - which
    I assume means that you'll be converting to curves in an app like illustrator
    - there should be no issue? However, If you are feeling especially worried you
    could ask the font vendor to sell you a Type 1 version \u2013 I\u2019m sure they\u2019d
    be happy to take your money. "

    hinting capabilities that format provides. Tahoma/Verdana are an excellent example
    of this.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
