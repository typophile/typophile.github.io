    You can change the coordinates by dragging it. You can also command-click (control-click
    for Windows) on it and a little window pops up that you can type coordinated into.\r\n\r\nThere
    is probably a way to reset the reference points of all glyphs to 0,0 but it's
    a bit beyond me how exactly to do it."

  body: "I may be wrong, but I believe that the reference point is not part of an
    exported font, but is only used (optionally) within FontLab as a reference for
    operations like rotation. \r\n\r\nIf you export the font and then re-open it,
    you will see that FontLab puts all the reference points in at 0.0 . \r\n\r\nIn
    other words, unless you are using it as a reference point in an operation--such
    as an instruction to rotate around the reference point--you can forget about it. "

    doesn't get exported (guidelines, background images, OT source code, etc.).

    point, you don't need the (movable) reference point to do it. For example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/referencepoint_6687.jpg]\r\n\r\nNote
    that \"zero point\" is one of the choices for a transformation."

  body: "An aside: They really should give the movable reference point a different
    name. In the manual, the term \"reference point\" is used interchangeably to mean
    either the movable reference point (the little asterisk icon you can move around)
    or any other reference point. It's a bit confusing that one of your choices for
    a reference point is the reference point.\r\n\r\n"

    get any additional functionality by having the reference point at o.o, how does
    it help you to move the reference point back to 0.0? "

  body: ">note to self\r\n\r\nI kept moving it back to 0.0 for months until one day
    I asked myself, why the heck am I doing this? \r\n\r\nThis illustrates a pet gripe
    about the FontLab manual. It tells you that the reference point is useful for
    a symmetrical letter--though I'm not sure why as you have the option of rotating
    etc relative to the center of the selection--but doesn't tell you that it's only
    of any use in restricted situations. Basically, you have to figure out how its
    functionality or lack of functionality fits into the job of developing a typeface.
    A manual ought to give the user more guidance on this. \r\n\r\nAlso because you
    never need to use it at 0.0 it makes more sense for it not to be always on the
    glyph window, but rather to be inserted optionally when you want it, at a desired
    rotation center, etc. "
