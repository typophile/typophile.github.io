body: "An old thread http://www.typophile.com/node/34363 didn't seem to resolve this
  issue, wandering off as threads are wont to do . . .\r\n\r\nRecently, we set a book
  for a publisher in southwest, where a number of editors at the press have a Spanish
  background. (As far as I know though, most of their formal schooling was Anglo.)
  Anyway, they felt that when a excalm- or questiondown was followed by a capital
  letter, the exclam- questiondown should ride on the baseline, otherwise, it should
  not.\r\n\r\nWe wrote a simple calt feature to take care of this\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/down_5956.gif]\r\nWhere
  (F) is foundry, and (1) and (2) show the added calt feature.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts
  before we consider adding this to other fonts (where the license permits)."
