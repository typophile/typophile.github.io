body: I'm looking for a good type spec book (or two). Specifically, one that would
  show the full character sets (swashes, alternates, ligatures et al.) for the "Golden
  Age" ITC fonts such as Lubalin Graph, Firenze etc. as well as anything from Aldo
  Novarese. Does such a thing exist and is it possible to find it at a reasonable
  price?

    done some type specimen books that could be bought second hand. Prices vary of
    course. This friendly guy in Stockholm, Sweden has a a wide range of typography
    books. He might be able to dig something up for you?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.svaf.se/morris/index_eng.htm\r\n\r\nGood
    luck! "
