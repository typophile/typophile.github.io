body: This is all I have to work with. I am starting to believe it has been modified
  after outling. But really think it was an actual font at one time. Anyone care to
  take a stab at this one?!?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8037.gif"

  body: ThanX everyone!!! I really appreciate it. I have been searching a long time
    for this font. That&#39;s it! That&#39;s the one. <BR> <BR>I am somewhat new to
    the design/technical side of type though I have been hoarding them for years.
    I see I have a lot more studying to do! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
