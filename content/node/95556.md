  it was about advancement in type design, and wether the question wasn't \"Will it
  print?\" anymore but \"Will it read?\"\r\n\r\nI remember it was associated to Unger,
  but I may be wrong!"

  body: Hmm. From searching in response to your query, I've learned that Textype survives
    as Century 731, but found no quote matching what you seek (Griffith seems to have
    had this concern...).

  body: "Alessandro \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if this is what you\u2019re thinking
    of, because the wording is slightly different, but my first thought when I read
    your inquiry is that this sounds like something Dwiggins said to Griffith.\r\n\r\nWAD
    wrote one of his extensive missives to CHG on February 22, 1937, entitled \u201CNewsface.\u201D
    This contained the conceptual seed of what became his Experimental No. 223, also
    known as Hingham. There is a statement in the beginning which echoes your questions.
    Here are the first two paragraphs:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Your (Lino\u2019s) attack
    on the problem of newsface, <em>via</em> Ionic, Excelsior, etc., \u2014 is the
    first intelligent effort in the line ever made, and results in a solution that
    is adequate in every detail so far as I can learn, from all engineering angles.\r\n\r\nYou
    have taken the style of letter established as \u201Cthe\u201D newspaper face,
    and have modified it step by step until it will print under modern conditions,
    and can be read when printed. I think very little can be added on the side of
    the problem that comes under the head : It Will Print. If anything more can be
    done it will have to be in the department : It Can Be Read.\u201D</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis
    passage was quoted in the text used to show Hingham in the second volume of the
    <cite>Postscripts on Dwiggins</cite>, Typophile Chapbook XXXVI, published a few
    years after WAD\u2019s death.\r\n\r\nYou may be associating this with Unger because
    he also quoted this passage in his 1981 article in <cite>Quarendo</cite>, Vol
    XI No. 4, about WAD\u2019s Experimental No. 223.\r\n"

    the source of my association with Unger!
