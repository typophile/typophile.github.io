  body: "good quality workmanship. I think lower case \"g\" is a little more flowing/curvacious
    and playfull than the rest of the characters. I do not mind that but wonder if
    it was intentional or? \r\nIt seems these days the lc \"g\" often get a bit more
    play. \r\nI am not sure I see the reason it is called \"Mare\". I think of \"Mare\",
    a female horse and expect something bold, strong and curvacious. Name change should
    be a  consideration unless you will be building very bold weights."

  body: "I think it looks good. \r\n\r\nThe 's' and 'S' are tilting to the right.
    (The dollar sign as well)\r\n\r\nThe ear on the 'g' needs some work.\r\n\r\nThe
    '\xE6' would probably look better without the tail on the 'a'.\r\n\r\nThe 'Registered
    trademark' is too big. It should be superscript. But that is nitpicking. :)\r\n\r\nMKSG"

  body: 'This is impressive, nicely balanced. Something is not quite right about the
    m - does the left half need to be wider? Or the trick of narrowing the middle
    leg a hair to give the left arch a little more space? Also the middle of the W
    looks not quite right. The M I like. The g I like a lot. '
