    target=\"new\">this site's article</a> about Knuth's Metafont, it is a font creation
    tool that works similar to Adobe Multiple Master. It is not a font, as such, because
    it is used to create fonts. The article includes a list of fonts developed with
    Metafont, and Knuth developed one called 'Computer Concrete' and another called
    'ransom'. Bert, is it one of those?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    am feeling that Bert's lead to the MetaFont direction is not getting the answer.\r\n\r\nBiggest
    problem is that I don't know of a digital version. In the pre-update days, I would

    to that because the sample reminded me of the illustration on Page 196 in Richard
    Southall's \"Printer's type in the twentieh century\" (very interesting book,
    but foul-smelling!) and because it's obviously quite low res...\r\nAlso, the distorted
    sans serif seemed to me on par with Knuth's ideas on \"proper\" typesetting (irony
    intended).\r\n\r\nTo make a real comparison I'd have to hunt for the Knuth book
    I have somewhere, among hundreds of more or useless computer books, packed in
    cardboard boxes in three locations."

  body: "Bert, no criticism intended, but from the comments it seems that none of
    us can find any of the MetaFont creations that match the sample. Your suggestion
    sounded like a promising direction, because Joshua says (in separate e-mails)
    that this sample came from a manual written and printed by a teacher, within the
    last year. That says that this should be digital, and maybe not too hard to find,
    or expensive. Sorry I do not have Southall's book. Is it possible for you to post
    a scan of the sample there? If you don't have a place to post it, I would put
    it on a temporary page on my site, if you e-mail a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThe Knuth
    MetaFonts seemed mostly intended to be used for Math texts, where Joshua's sample
    was from a manual about language, or grammar, as I could understand it. This would
    not require special fonts with Math symbols.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Gerald, I've been writing to the poster, who originally contacted me about
    this ID, and Joshua told me this was done by a teacher, for his classes, as I
    mentioned in my last post. It seems unlikely to me that he would have printed
    this manual of grammar on letterpress.\r\n\r\nI like the 'Eastern European' idea,
    because none of us seems to know of a match, and \"The Fonts of Eastern Europe\"
    would be a book I'd love to see, if there was such a thing -- in other words,
    that's a big void in my information. The Russian fonts seem very 'derivative'
    if ParaType is typical. Czech fonts, other than Storm Type are also poorly known
    to me (sorry if I am forgetting others from here, but Peter Bil'ak, for example,
    is associated with Dutch type. Others of Czech origin like Ruzicka, Menhart and
    Licko have done their work in the U.S. or Western Europe, or have been known here
    through versions of their type published in Western foundries: Fairfield, Primer
    and Ruzicka Freehand (Ruzicka), Figural, Elysium and Oldrichium [derived from
    'Manuskript'] (Menhart). Zuzana Licko, of Emigr\xE9, is well known and hard to
    categorize.) \r\n\r\nThe flagged 'r' you mentioned, is also found in the typeface
    'DeRoos', by the Dutch designer of that name; and it resembles the 'r' in Bembo
    somewhat.\r\n\r\nCan you suggest some Eastern European candidates for this font?\r\n\r\n\r\n-

    European stuff I have (as well as all the usual sources). Looking specifically
    for a similar flag on the lowercase r. The DeRoos does not match nor any other.
    The r appears to have a bit of calligraphic grace to it but it must be an anomaly
    in reproduction (which is why I asked about letterpress and the possibility of
    ink distortion).\r\n\r\nThere is a very strange mix of typographic study/specimen
    book titled  Typo graphia &/2 (done for ITC in 1981) by Oldrich Hlavsa and Karel
    Wick that oddly includes (as a matter of pride I suspect) a large number of Czech
    type faces not normally seen by western eyes. But I was unable to pinpoint the
    typeface in question. Likely I am seeing something on that r that is not there.\r\n\r\nGerald"

    fraktur to roman faces typical of the Incunabula period. Gotico Eporedia has a
    very similar flag. ATF Verona has something near similiar.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "Gerald, Joshua had told me that it was no longer possible for him to contact
    this teacher. That was why he was asking for help identifying the typeface.  I
    agree that the De Roos 'r' has a different shape, but overall that typeface is
    still the most similar, for the most characters, that I could find for the typeface.
    I have nothing that shows 'Gotico Eporedia', but I have a sample of ATF 'Verona'
    and while it's true that the 'r' has a similar flag, that is almost its only resemblance
    to the sample text, since it looks like a pen drawn type.\r\n\r\nAs Hrant noted
    Gill has at least one face with a similar 'r' and a stemmed U (<a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=206040\"
    target=\"new\">Gill Facia</a>), but the W and many other letters are not very
    close. His Perpetua isn't much like this font, except for the stemmed U, and none
    of the other Gill serif faces I know (Pilgrim, Joanna and Solus) has a stemmed
    U, or a W like the sample type.  Hrant, did you have another Gill candidate to
    offer?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "<em>\"Golden Cockerel?\"</em>\r\n\r\nHrant, I forgot to mention that one,
    but from the posted sample and the samples of Golden Cockerel, there seem to be
    very few similar characters. \r\n\r\nI would have to agree with Gerald. By a process
    of elimination, and assuming that the budget of academics for exotic typefaces
    is non-existent, a web freeware font is as good a guess as any.  However, there
    is too much that seems professional about this type, suggesting that some type
    'borrowing', and maybe some font editing, created this font. I'm at a loss to
    identify the possible sources of any specific letters, because there is so little
    that seems really distinctive besides the flagged 'r'.\r\n\r\nIf I had to try
    to create this, I think I would use Perpetua, so I guess I am agreeing with the
    Gill camp. The 's' seems similarly flattened, the 'f' seems right, the 'k' is
    the same style, and it has the stemmed 'U'. I would need to modify the W and the
    M to make it closer, but the more I look at this, the more I think it IS a version
    of Perpetua. The Stephenson Blake version shown in Jaspert (p.177) is very close,
    except for the two letters I mentioned, and the 'y'. Joshua's W is more stepped,
    and the M is straight-sided, rather than splayed; the 'y' has a serif on the tail,
    more like the Monotype version.\r\n\r\nMy final answer: This is a modified version
    of Perpetua, possibly one of the 'budget' clone varieties found on the 3,000 fonts
    for $9.95 CD's.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "This thread is really old now, but some time ago I found out the source of
    the two searched typefaces, and as I now stumbled over this thread, I thought
    it would be fair to let you know because of your efforts. Just in case someone
    cares.\r\n\r\nI found out that my former teacher uses the Atari word processor
    \u201CSignum\u201D, and I managed to get a copy of it. This program uses bitmap
    fonts in its own format, and formerly there were several suppliers for Signum
    fonts. Many of the fonts come in different sizes and resolutions.\r\n\r\nThe two
    fonts used in the shown paper are supplied with the program. The headline font
    is called \u201CAKZ___13\u201D. Because of the name, I thought it may be modelled
    after Akzidenz-Grotesk; it is, however, different. (Maybe someone has an idea
    if there\u2019s a similar typeface which could have served as a model?) A sample
    is attached.\r\n\r\nThe serif font is called \u201CANTIKR_N\u201D, I attached
    a sample of it, too. It seems you were right, Mike, and it\u2019s a version of
    Perpetua. And I like it! I'm fond of these fonts\u2019 rough charm.\r\n\r\nThe
    3rd and 4th attached image are samples (in the size of 13 and 50 pt.) of another
    interesting Signum font I like\u2014and couldn\u2019t withhold from you\u2014named
