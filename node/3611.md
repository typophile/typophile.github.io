body: ' Hi All, <BR> <BR>Got a strange request from a lady who would like a font converted
  from Open Type to True Type. Now clearly I&#39;ll send her back to the publisher
  of the original font, but for my information I don&#39;t think anybody has ever
  brought up that topic. <BR> <BR>So how does one reverse engineer an OT font back
  to a PS1 or TT font? <BR> <BR>Stuart :D '

  body: Open the OT font in FontLab 4.x, choose the encoding mode &#40;names mode,
    codepages mode, which codepage if applicable&#41; and generate the font in the
    applicable format. If you&#39;re generating a TTF, trash all the OT features first.
    <BR> <BR>For Truetype, I usually keep it in Unicode mode unless they&#39;re using
    a very old version of Windows. For Type 1 PC, set it to MS Windows 1252 Latin
    1 <B>in codepage mode</B>. &#40;Or whatever codepage your customer is using.&#41;
    For Type 1 Mac, set it to Macintosh Roman encoding <B>in Names mode</B>. <BR>
    <BR><B>Don&#39;t choose Adobe Standard Encoding.</B> This causes ugly Symbol substitution.
    <BR> <BR>You will need TransType if you are generating Mac suitcase files.
