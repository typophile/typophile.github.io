body: "What is the attached font?\r\n\r\nIt's from the letterpress lab at the university
  of oregon. It is 15 pica sans serif. It is not labeled, and it bares no foundry
  stamp or company insignia. It is most likely older than 1965, and could be as old
  as 1900.\r\n\r\nIt only exists in caps, although there are a few varying figures.
  (two types of A's, etc.) I tried to pick the figures with a similar grain pattern,
  the thought being that they would be of the same shipment of type.\r\n\r\nIt is
  possible that this font has not been digitized, but any help you guys can offer
  would be amazing![img:sites/default/files/old-images/woodsanssmaller_4592.jpg]"
