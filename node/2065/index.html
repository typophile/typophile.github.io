<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>hi, i am designing a logo for a ficticious coffee company (for school) and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions. This is my first go at it so its still a bit rough. <br> <br>The company, f</div>

<div class=commentbody>Jason, <br>Just a quick note and I gues this may be deliberate? but it reads FUS not FYs? which could have both negative and posative implications. Too much fuss. I like the almost hand drawn approach to the three atoms and the way you have ballanced the coffee lettering with some heavy posative kerning, demonstrating some mature typogrphical consideration. Not into the FUZ, not liking the F and Z and I'm not even sure the futuristic look you where going for works with the rest of the sytle. Although there is something appealing about the U, sorry Y?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Jason, as coffee is a food item (sort of) and food items should be attractive, at least to the tastebud part of our brians, I'm not sure you have found the right direction. Could you show us your sketches/thumbnails?</div>

<div class=commentbody>jason --- i'd take a look at the F U and S ... <br>They are legible forms, but odd and uninviting. <br>Putting them on different baselines might not be helping. <br> <br>Seems like the letter U could be a coffee cup with <br>the atoms above it, where normally steam <br>would be rising off? <br> <br>Or, maybe not. Forcing a cup into a coffee logo might be cliche. <br> <br>You could also put a line over the u to indicate <br>a Long U perhaps. <br> <br>bj</div>

<div class=commentbody>So I gather then their is some phonetical reason for the umlaut? <br>Allthough it doesn't seem to connect with the brief you have set yourself or am I missing something? <br> <br>Long &uuml; Short &uuml; <br>Spelling: &uuml;h, &uuml; Spelling: &uuml;, y <br>Pronunciation: No similar sound in English, but the same as the vowel in French rue. To produce it, say the German long i, then round the lips as for long u. Do not allow your tongue to move toward the back of your mouth as you round your lips. Note the difference between the long rounded back vowel u, and the long rounded front vowel &uuml;. Pronunciation: A shorter version of German long &uuml;. To produce it, say the German short i, then round the lips as for short u. Do not allow your tongue to move toward the back of your mouth as you round your lips. Note the difference between the short rounded back vowel u, and the short rounded front vowel &uuml;. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Jason, look at making the atoms coffee beans if you want to have a toung-in-cheek approach. It would be like a line of juice drinks here called "Sir Real" they use campy fake Surrealist Images on their products (and some of the worst type treatments I've ever seen). Heed, Tiffany's comment, its right on. Dan</div>

<div class=commentbody>daniel - <br>i actually had the atoms as coffee beans in one of my sketches, and one where the atoms were flying around a coffee bean... i thought it might be a bit cheesy.. and also thought it wouldnt work because the atoms are supposed to be coffee, creamer, and sugar coming together as one.. but I might be attmepting to be to literal. Ill give the beans thing a shot and work on the type. <br> <br>Sorry about not being able to scan my sketches tiffany, my scanner is not being very nice to me lately <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif alt=:-( border=0> <br> <br>paul- <br>i might not be using the umlaut correctly. the company was originally called fuze. i had experimented with different ways of spelling the same word... fuse and f</div>

<div class=commentbody>Jason, don't let the logo dictate the marketing. The marketing is the cream sugar and coffee all in one. I think you should simplify the mark and let the packaging tell the marketing story. So concentrate on a mark that creates an umbrella for the coffee company. What if they came out with a coffee that after you drank it you'd have a mint after taste in your mouth. Ask yourself does the mark allow the coffee company to grow. Dan </div>

<div class=commentbody>ok i altered the letterforms a bit (simplified) and last night was able to get my first rough out for the packaging concept. any suggestions would be great.. thanks everyone for all your help. <br> <br>Oh and the one on the left is transparent with a white knockout for the main graphic and the one on the right is printed on white paper. The circulating rings get lost on the transparent package, but are still subtly there which is kind of nice. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/21076.jpg alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>Jason think in terms of the entire line of coffees. What is the color scheme for Decafe for instance? I also would like the background of the logo to be a richer warmer color. Also think about possibly printing on a metalic foil label. That way you could use white as a color to print and the background of regular blend could have a yellow printed over a silver foil and a white regular blend printed over that. That way you could let the silver knock out from your richer brown color for your logo. It would be a rich label. In the case I propose you'd need to include the "All in one coffee filters" into the single label. </div>
