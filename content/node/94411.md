  body: "It looks like as if it was printed on an old (mid 20th century) telegram,
    teletype, or tickertape printer. I can understand the serifs on the P and not
    the R, but can't understand the serifs on the M but not the N. Possibly the printer
    was repaired and had some of its characters replaced at.\r\n\r\n - Herb "
