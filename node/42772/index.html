  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hi, 

I've been working on this logo for a while now and 
I've completely lost any objectivity. I would appreciate any advice, recommendations
or constructive criticism because basically I can't tell anymore if it's alright or complete crap.

P.S. It's for a interactive studio and the typeface is modified PMN Caecila

Cheers.

		<div class="commentbody">The type works great, IMHO.

The mark, while slick, seems purely decorative and arbitrary and I'd argue isn't really needed at all. Since this is for a design studio, I'd suggest dropping the mark all together. It keeps the type pure and prevents your own logo from competing with your actual work in the portfolio.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with aluminum, I like them independently, but not necessarily together. They are very different in feel: the mark seems fluid and decorative and the typography is a little "stiff" for the mark. Maybe if both pieces used the same type of line (either rounded or straight ends) or maybe if you modify the type to flow with the mark instead of chopping the ends. 
Good luck - I too am fighting with a logo but I don't know if I am brave enough to post!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First of all, thanks everyone for your comments, it's great to get some feedback...
In response to some of the posts:

Dan: It does have a meaning behind it, but I think your right and it may be far to obscure and overly subtle. The four pieces coming together are supposed to represent wolfs, the three lines as claw-marks in the shape of a wolf's front leg. Also the star in the negative space relates to the Lupus (the wolf) constellation.

Others: I think you are right the type could probably exist without the mark, and i am looking at going down this road, although I am very attached to that symbol :).
 
Another point(probably why I'm finding this logo difficult to resolve) is that it's for a personal business venture.

Again cheers for your feedback.

		<div class="commentbody">You say the three lines in the mark represent claw-marks, but when I think about claw-marks ik picture raw and powerful lines instead of subtle rounded ones. It's like a wolf trying to paint with paint on it's nails. Could be a nice image, if that's what you were aiming at. 
Although i think the mark looks really nice and the idea behind it is pretty good, it doesn't really fit the name of the studio. But that's my opinion</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Brainstorming, I think a better image (if you're still considering a logomark) would be a wolfpack. I'm envisioning the silhouette of 3 wolves standing proud, as if they're looking out over a cliff at their prey. One centered, one angled to the right and one angled to the left (off kilter, wolves aren't into symmetry.)

		<div class="commentbody">I also immediately thought that the customized type was done really well, and could exist on its own without a problem. But I can imagine you are attached to the symbol, because it does look very nice. If you keep 'em both, I would suggest closing the gap between the two a little. 
To make the wordmark play the leading role, you could also see what happens if you make the symbol smaller. Although I can imagine it might indeed get too light compared to the type when you do that.

Otherwise; go for it. It's nice.</div>
