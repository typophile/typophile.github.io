body: "Hi My employer had a font created based on the Director's handwriting and use
  it for headlines and a logo... I really hate it so I undertook to revise it. I'm
  pretty new to fontforge-- along the way i have discovered how complex font issues
  are BUT have managed to rework the font and output a \"version2\" with better kerning
  and legibility. I feel like I'm getting close to the point where I could deploy
  it however it is not working properly in MS Publisher (2003)Super frustrating...
  anyone have any ideas? i worked on it in the x111 environment on the mac and output
  then installed on the PC. It shows up as the Unknown character- a series of rectangular
  boxes when I use the font in Publisher. Seems to work ok in other PC software though
  I'm sure there is a lot of room for improvement.\r\n\r\nI'm going to upload these
  to see if anyone has the time to QA this a little with me... I think you can right
  click the links below and save as to access the fonts (reg and bold)\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nhttp://mysite.verizon.net/pbrack06/uhab/KerstinHandV2.ttf\r\nhttp://mysite.verizon.net/pbrack06/uhab/KerstinHandV2B.ttf"

    MS Publisher, though.

    Font Validator]] and try to correct the reported issues, and hopefully that might
    fix it ...\r\n\r\nOr perhaps generating a different font format, OpenType with
    PS outlines e.g.\r\n\r\nJens"

  body: "This font has both ANSI and Symbol charsets enabled in its OS/2 table, so
    that MS Publisher probably recognizes it as a symbol font and maps typed characters
    to the U+F0XX Unicode range instead of normal Unicode values. To fix that, you
    should open the font in FontForge and go to Element->Font Info->OS/2->Charsets.
    Then do the following:\r\n\r\n-- Check the Unicode Ranges->Default flag;\r\n--
    Deselect the \"Symbol Charset\" line in the \"MS Code Pages\" list (only \"1252,
    Latin-1\" should remain selected);\r\n-- Regenerate the font.\r\n\r\nAs far as
    I can see, this should help."
