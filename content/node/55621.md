  I use that time to surf around various design blogs. Usually, I'll peruse Ffffound
  more thoroughly than I would in my free time at home. Mostly, because the computer
  monitors at school are gloriously large and crystal clear. I can stretch my browser
  out and visually stimulate myself to my heart's content.\r\n\r\nTypography has long
  been my favorite thing about Graphic Design. There was never any doubt about that.
  Though, this morning, I felt a new kind of sensation when I viewed a row of designs
  that made me weak at the knees. My stomach turned in knots and my mouth went dry.
  \r\nAt that moment I felt that I needed to express this new, curious jolt of affection.
  \r\n\r\nTypography is like a drug."
