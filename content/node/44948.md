  body: Rob Dobi created the freebie font Killigraphy. It never had a lowercase --
    or numbers or punctuation, for that matter.

  body: "Killigraphy was apparently copied from page 129 of Arthur Baker's book 'Calligraphy',
    which was published in 1973. The illustrations in the book are meant as examples
    for other calligraphers to follow and usually don't include full \"character sets\".
    Often, only a lowercase is shown with, perhaps, a capital 'A'. Dobi apparently
    did not have the skill to create an uppercase to go with Baker's lowercase (not
    many would).\r\n\r\nIf you search for \"arthur baker\" on MyFonts (or elsewhere)
    you will find lots of fonts designed by him, some of which are similar to Killigraphy,
    although they are generally less spontaneous and more polished in appearance.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=arthur+baker\r\n"

    to have the pages from this book be digitized. In fact there was no \"digital\"
    work being done when this book was published. This guy really did \"kill\" Arthur's
    graphy.  Arthur and I are in the process of bringing some of this work to digital
    reality. Matador was one of the first. There are four others in the process. And
    Arthur is exploring other venues for previously badly digitized fonts that have
    been hacked by others. There is so much there after decades of work that he has
    relented, and is now interested in doing them right rather than having them done
    slipshod. FULL CHARACTER sets. Not junk by people who have software that want
    to make money off of some one else's intellectual property.\r\n\r\nArthur and
    I just spoke and he is in full agreement with this statement.\r\n\r\nI on the
    other hand find this practice bereft of any values! The book is protected by copyright
    laws.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Thank you for saying this, Michael. \r\n\r\nI was rather disturbed that this
    Killigraphy font existed. What I hoped I was implying when I said that the fonts
    are \"less spontaneous and more polished in appearance\" was that a font is necessarily
    going to be less spontaneous than calligraphy. On the other hand, a font created
    by simply lifting forms from a piece of calligraphy will only have a mechanical
    kind of spontaneity. For the real thing you need a calligrapher, somebody like
    Arthur."

    of summed it up. But being a blabbermouth I ranted on! Sorry\r\n\r\nIf Anthony
    wants a similar font then I suggest he simply check Adobe, Linotype, MyFonts,
    etc...\r\n\r\nMichael"
