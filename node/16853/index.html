<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This is the other one in the shop that we can't figure out - someone gave it to me along with some Franklin Gothic Extra Condensed. (I think he thought they were the same typeface.)
I'd chalk it up as one of the hundreds of Gothic No.-- faces that emerged and then disappeared, except that there are two different nicks throughout the font. If different people were casting it, maybe it's something known... Anyway. Have a look??

Not sure what you mean by 'nicks'. I also wish there were a cap R in the sample - that's one of the characters I really use to identify sans serifs.
Alternate Gothic SB One is the closest I've found, but not exact.

<div class=commentbody>Here's the problem when one tries to identify metal fonts, is that we don't get a full showing and have to guess at a point.
Your sample looks very close to "Alternate Gothic 1" <a href=http://www.donblack.ca/fonts/gothic.htm target=new>Trade Gothic Bold Extra Condensed</a>, based on the unique spur on the uppercase "G".
Also, since we are looking at metal faces, there will be design differences between point sizes (scaling). So I believe Patricia is correct in identifying a digital version of Alternate Gothic #1.

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, there weren't any cap Rs in the font he gave me - I don't know what happened to them, since there were a decent number of all the other characters.
I looked on Don's site but couldn't tell from his graphics if the G matched up. You think it does?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've been hunting through the McGrew book on American Metal Typefaces and the A.T.A. Type Comparison Book. I got pretty excited for a minute about Monotype New Gothic Condensed, because it had the large hook on the J and the right K (both features were unlike Alternate Gothic). It even had the spur 'beard' on the G, but the G is too closed, and the Q has the wrong tail. The $ was pretty close, but the numerals were not shaped the same. Sigh!
I think your comment about the hundreds of numbered Gothics is the true key to why we are having so little luck. It seems every foundry has a variety of weights and widths of Gothics, and without knowing the Foundry or the age of the type, we can only hope to get lucky.
(Side question: Norbert, how did you manage to include a graphic in your post? I didn't think that was possible. I've been waiting for that capability to come back.)

<div class=commentbody>Mike, if you have the Flash 8 player plug-in installed in your browser, there is an insert image link underneath the comment field. You can use that to post images in threads.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bad news. For Flash 8 I need to be using some version of Mac OS X, and I'm still on 9.2. I didn't want to have to bite that bullet. ;-(

<div class=commentbody>I figured as much. All I have to go on is that it's 72 point, with a centered foot groove. One of the nicks [marks created by the casting machine on the body of the type - they show you which way is up, and also often help identify who cast the type] is one I've never seen before - a triangular-shaped groove instead of a rounded one.
It came from a shop in MA, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.
I'm getting McGrew for myself for Christmas :)</div>
