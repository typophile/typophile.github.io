  looks like a \"Times\" variant, but then I noticed the serifs of the capital italicized
  letters 'I' and 'A'  (see detail)\r\n\r\nClosest I came to it was 'Times BQ'  or
  in my library it is also listed under \"Times New Roman* MONOTYPE Regular\" ...

  body: "Did you try using the [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]]? When I use it this is definitely Times, and I think the Compugraphic
    (CG) version that came from Agfa (now Fonts.com) looks like the right one. I think
    the serifs on your I and A were slightly misprinted, and not actually like the
    way they appear.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
