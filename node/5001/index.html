  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am in high school, and I type essays and other material Literature and also History. When I type essays et al., I generally use Times New Roman, because that is the default in most word processors, including MS Word at school and OpenOffice.org at home. However, I do not like this typeface, as it seems narrow and rather ugly. I am wondering what might be a good replacement typeface that would look good but not be too wacky as it would not be accepted by my teachers. I have done a little research into typography in general, and it seems that I prefer oldstyle lettering to modern (e.g. the contrast between narrow and wide, the way the thin points of an `o' are vertically aligned from each other in modern, et al.). What might I use? <BR> <BR>P.S.: My father has legal access to almost every version of Photoshop and Illustrator, so typefaces that come with those applications are easily accessable. Also, I am a high school student, and I would like to avoid spending $100 on a typeface, so try to suggest ones of little or no cost. <BR> <BR>Thank you in advance, <BR>Iain</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, teachers still require students to submit papers in MLA format, which is 12pt double-spaced, <i>x</i> number of pages, etc. etc. <BR> <BR>Although Berlidin looks nice enough, it seems so wide that I am sure a teacher would notice the wideness and mark points off for that. At school I have found something called Palatino on some computers, Palatino Linotype on others, and both on some. They seem identical except Palatino Linotype has more leading. Would these work for schoolwork? Also, I have found a typeface called Georgia, but the problem is that numerals are non-lining, and I do not know if my teacher would object. I unfortunately do not seem to have Palatino at home, although I do have Palatino Linotype. Is there somewhere I could get Palatino for free if it is a good typeface for homework?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Palatino at 12pt. actually occupies a bit more space than Times, which can be a pretty significant gain over a few page essay.  This is a Good Thing if you have page limits, but Palatino does look quite a bit different in terms of page color, so the teacher might notice. <BR> <BR>If you wanted something in the same vein that's just a better type, perhaps you should try a Baskerville, maybe like <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/jbasker.html">Storm's</a> or <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/baskerville1757.asp">Fountain's</a>. <BR> <BR>I've also used Jenson and Garamond, and I prefer them both to Transitional types for this sort of paper. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would say just use Times New Roman, I mean they are the ones reading the paper, if thats what they are prefering you to write the essay in it makes sense.

		<div class="commentbody">Great suggestions all. The only thing I do not like about Whitman (other than the price as you pointed out) is that it seems almost like a sans serif typeface with blocky serifs added on, rather than having thick and thing strokes and having serifs that curve from the text. That may be merely a matter of preference though, and it may look fine at small sizes, I do not know. <BR> <BR>About the Baskerville typefaces, the first one (Storm's) I question only because they basically said they were too cheap to look at all his work and copy it, they just looked at some letters and made the rest in the same style. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, Fountain's version has no boldface typeface. I don't use boldface, but what if I needed to for some reason? <BR> <BR>By the way, does anyone know if any of these typefaces are included with any Adobe software? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Iain</div>
