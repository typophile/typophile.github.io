  body: 'Since reading on TV is non-immersive &#40;at least if we&#39;re talking about
    short captions here&#41; and the lo-res and interlacing cause of a lot of fuzz,
    well-spaced sans forms &#40;with a generous x-height&#41; work best I think. One
    of my most favorite fonts for this kind of work is Poppl-Laudatio &#40;which also
    has a lot of character at large sizes&#41;. <BR> <BR>BTW, check out Tiresias too:

  body: For titles - dramas and serious programming tends to use serif, comedy and
    reality TV tends to use sans. Legibility doesn&#39;t seem to be a major consideration
    - it&#39;s about branding. <BR> <BR>Your paper might be better if you focus on
    captioning, subtitles and other forms of small text on TV rather than titles.
    screenfont.ca is a good starting point if you&#39;re after some juicy quotes.  <BR>
    <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: Isn&#39;t it mainly a resolution issue? Unless the type is large, any typeface
    with fine details will get lost in both the low-res of traditional TV and the
    inerit blurring that is added. <BR> <BR>That said, the parents just got a new
    HD-wide screen TV that I spent most of my saturday afternoon wasting away in front
    of and I must say that type looks absolutely stunning on it.

  body: Think about TV today its about exploding graphics, fast cuts, and head shots.
    It has nothing to do about type. Its about cheesy photoshop techniques. Most type
    I see on TV is terrible &#40;MacNeil Learer report type is so terrible to make
    me cry&#41; there is no craft in TV type.

    I don&#39;t know how size is specified in TV graphics and captioning, maybe by
    scan lines, maybe as a proportion of the screen height? <BR> <BR>The point I was
    making is that &#39;Titles&#39; &#40;the subject of your original mail&#41; are
    not as interesting as subtitles and captions, or as interesting as the special
    fonts used in set-top boxes and digital TV. <BR> <BR>&#62;= &#34;...the typeface

    one extreme but I think a lot of font people and designers share them. You could
    write a whole paper on the subject of that one font. The process by which it was
    created and how it became a TV standard are quite well documented. And the people
    involved are probably quite approachable.   <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si'
