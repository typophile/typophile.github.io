body: "Aghhh! I just got a job interview while I was in the process of getting my
  resume and cover page together, but I am cursed and my computer crashed, and I couldn't
  get it up until the last day so please help me. This is my first cover letter and
  I want to do a good job, even though I don't have much time.\r\n\r\nThe company
  I'm applying for designs things for industrial and technology companies. Although
  it's not exactly glamorous, I need a job, so it will have to do. According to their
  website, the advantage they have over other companies is that they understand the
  challenges faced by tech companies because they've been doing business to business
  advertising for almost 20 years.\r\n\r\nI haven't yet designed the cover page or
  resume but I'm working on it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the font yet, but I'm thinking
  Legato would do well. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThe cover letter, please rip it apart:\r\n\r\nDear
  Peter,\r\n\r\nMy name is Anthony Iverson, and I am a graphic and web designer. I
  first heard about your company from Janet, a relative of mine, and I was immediately
  interested in having the opportunity to meet you.\r\n\r\nThe other day I was looking
  at your website when I realized your company values reminded me of those of a designer
  named Otl Aicher, on whom I did a project last year. In this project I had to research
  his life and work and then write an article about him. I came to the conclusion
  that there was one important quality that separated him from most other designers
  of his time. It was his longing to create lasting brand value in the companies he
  worked for through efficient, pleasing, and logical design.\r\n\r\nI also see those
  qualities in your work and writing, and I feel it's something we have in common.
  It's something I strongly believe in, that all my work be designed for the benefit
  of the reader, and to strengthen the client's brand, according to their own needs
  and goals.\r\n\r\nI'm very grateful for your time, and I hope to be considered as
  an addition to your team. I know we can do great things together. Thank you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnthony
  Iverson"

  body: "Hello Anthony,\r\n\r\nhave you already spoken (on phone) with the gentleman
    you are addressing (Peter)? If not, I would still keep it formal with \"Mr. Lastname\".\r\n\r\nIs
    your relative, Janet, in good-standing and respected in the company (no offense,
    since your credibility is first judged by what credibility the company has in
    her).\r\n\r\nAre these people even going to know about Herr Aicher? How he busted
    the balls of Dr. Braun during the rebranding? If they do know about Aicher, they
    may not agree with his philosophies and \"bedside manner\".\r\n\r\nI'm just combing
    over what might be viewed as \"negatives\".\r\nYour closing \"I know we can do
    great things together.\" sounds a little too intimate and you might be better
    off dropping it.\r\n\r\nJust my humble opinion."

  body: I agree with Norbert on all points - keep it formal, drop the "great things
    together" (it sounds like you are considering them as a peer or equal partner,
    and not your boss, which they may not take kindly to). I would also eliminate
    the bit about Otl Aicher, this is a bit too esoteric. I would state your strenghts,
    your experience, and why you would like to work for them. Keep it brief, and to
    the point.

  body: "Update for anyone who's interested: \r\n\r\nI stayed up until 4 am working
    on my resume design last night, and made some adjustments to the cover letter
    and had them all ready to be printed out in the morning. It turns out I copied
    the wrong files to be printed and I had an older, quite awful version of my resume
    using Times New Roman, with a poor layout on two pages. I was so heart broken.
    And if I went back home to get the right files I would be late for the interview.
    Fortunately he didn't ask for the resume during the interview, so I never handed
    him the crappy version. He checked out my work and we talked for a while and it
    was overall a good interview, but I think he was doubting my experience a little
    bit. So I didn't quite get the job, but he said he was thinking maybe I could
    do some freelance work for him this summer, just to test the water. So it's better
    than nothing.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help and honest opinions. And don't
    think it was all for nothing, you've helped me see what I can do better, and I'll
    put it to use in my next cover letter.  :-)"
