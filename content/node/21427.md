    target=\"_blank\">Davida</a> is not an exact match. This could be a font \"inspired\"

  body: "Predigital VGC Davida had alternates - like the A and E as seen in the image.
    The X in the font shown at Fontshop is backwards (now how does THAT happen?)!\r\n\r\nStephen
    - I can't find the selling foundry anywhere on the page Lex that links to (we
    know it ain't VGC). Just a heads up. In fact, I see now that only when you do
    a Search on a name and get the choices are the selling foundries shown. Beyond
    that they are AWOL.\r\n\r\nEdit: The Linotype and Bitstream versions have the
    correct X."
