body: "Hello! This would have been posted sooner but I've been waiting for Myfonts
  to approve an introductory discount offer and for the news release to show up on
  Fontlover.com. While we're waiting for all that, here's the release:\r\n\r\n==================begin
  news release==================\r\n\r\ns e n t i n e l &nbsp;t y p e &nbsp;presents\r\n\r\na
  font designed by <a href=\"http://www.kingdomofawesome.com/\">Haley Fiege</a> and
  produced by <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/person/arboghast/james/\">James Arboghast</a>\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/soft-serve/\">S O F T &nbsp;S E R V
  E</a>\r\n\r\nLooking like happy frosting on a cupcake at a twiddle bug party, this
  bouncy food entry from Canadian designer Haley Fiege turns Sentinel's Jellybrush
  type into organic happiness you can spread on pancakes, ice-cream, sorbets. Use
  it for sauces and condements, oh peanut butter! Hotdogs, sandwich fillings, rubbery
  items. Anything really.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/soft-serve/\">[img:sites/default/files/old-images/soft_serve_5683.gif]</a>\r\nSoft
  Serve sample designed by Haley\r\n\r\n<strong>Language Support:</strong> Latin 1
  (Western 1252/Mac OS Roman) + Turkish\r\n<strong>Formats:</strong> OpenType (TrueType
  coming very soon. Sorry folks, I just plain forgot to make them)\r\n<strong>Regular
  Price:</strong> $24.90\r\n<strong>Snipped Price: $17.43</strong>\r\n<strong>Link:
  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/soft-serve/\">Check it out here</a></strong>\r\n\r\n=================end
  news release====================\r\n\r\nGrab some <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/arboghast/sets/72157608667441532/\">samples
  from my flickrstream here</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd here are some stickers for you:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/icecreamstickers_4162.jpg]\r\nIce-cream
  stickers designed by Haley.\r\n\r\nAnd here's a picture of Shirley Temple:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shirley_5439.jpg]\r\n\r\nWell
  it was in the IN drive with Haley's ice-cream stickers and I love Shirley Temple,
  so you're getting her as well, okay? I think that's a pretty fair deal. I love me
  the Shirley Temple. Youth&#8212;it's the one thing worth having.\r\n\r\n<strong>About
  the font:</strong> I suggested to Haley she could make a more commercial and appealing
  version of my <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/jellybrush/\">Jellybrush
  font</a>. Haley loved the idea because that one is right up her street. Nobody does
  cute better than Miss Fiege can. She did a great job on it, then passed it back
  to me for refinement and product finishing.\r\n\r\nSo for the curious, all glyphs
  in the lower case of Soft Serve are Haley's designs except the new <strong>x</strong>
  by yours truly, and most of the cappies are Haley-tweaked versions of Jellybrush
  capitals.\r\n\r\nIt was the kind of beautiful, smooth-running collaboration you
  dream about.\r\n\r\nWhen the introductory discount offer comes online I'll post
  that.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
