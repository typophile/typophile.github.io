  font: Piglence.\r\nI'd love to hear your comment or feedback for the proportion
  of a few glyphs, like the O, Q, G and Y. \r\nNot sure if they're having good balance.
  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n~ A u d e e\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Piglence-Light-A-Z_5558.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Piglence-Light-A-F_6191.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Piglence-Light-C_3931.jpg]"

  body: /H, /K, /X, /V, /Z are too wide. /M and /W are too narrow. Get rid of the
    /C with the straight side and use the rounded /C, but fix the upper left curve.
    Upper right curve of the /D, /G, /O also need work. To help you see the imbalance,
    flip the glyph upside-down when you look at it; errors become much more apparent.

  body: The E looks top heavy to me and I agree with George on the too wide letters.
