  consultant . I came up with these 4 ideas, but somehow they all seem familiar to
  me; i did it all from scratch and tried to be as original as possible, but at the
  end i wonder if they are very similar to some others already existing. The copy
  reads \"human connection\" in spanish. I\xB4ll appreciate your help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/conexion

    to something else. They are \"done from scratch\", and that is it. Si no es totalmente

    look somewhat similar to the [[http://www.ubuntu.com|Ubuntu Linux]] logo. I like
    the top left.\r\n\r\nst"

  body: "Yes, the two on the right hand side definitely look like the Ubuntu Linux
    logo (especially the bottom right).\r\n\r\nThe bottom left has the most potential,
    although right now it looks a little silly (too much like a smiley).  But I think
    that one communicates a human connection better than the top left.  That one reminds
    me of the Enron logo, and I don't think you're going for that."

  body: "Hello friends, you\xB4re right about UBUNTU logo, do you think this colored
    version steps away? I just finished another design, this is pretty much my style
    (when illustrating personal projects) i tried to make it more personal to set
    it apart, i think it may work... critique accepted... thank you... [img:sites/default/files/old-images/prueba

    products...\r\nI like the \"smiley\" one: IMO, the professional typesetting contrasts
    quite well with the friendly logo."

  body: "Thanks for the support abaldoni, the green one stands for many outdoors activities
    during the consultancy, and reprsents the freedom achieved after them. The first
    one obviusly stands for the teamwork and the \"4 colour insights method\" applied
    during the consultancy... I\xB4ll appreciate more feedback since im almost on
    time to show this first round and i know many of you typophiles are great critiques
    ;) thanks!!!"

  body: "I like the one to the right in the last draft. Maybe find another color to
    get away from the organic products feel.\r\n\r\nThe one to the left is also good
    but maybe a little close to Ubuntu. Otherwise it's a nice concept."

  body: "I think in the second set the one on the right is excellent.  I don't necessarily
    get an organic food products feel myself, although the advice to try different
    colors is well taken.\r\n\r\nI don't like the one on the left at all.  It looks
    like what would happen if the Windows and Ubuntu logos had a baby."
