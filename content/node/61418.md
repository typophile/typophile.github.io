  texts and poetry for content. Danke!

    their place - Poetry isn't it.

    in the first place. If you think those choices are nuts, you should read the poetry

    ubiquitous is a better word?).\r\n\r\nI don't have the time, nor the license,
    to open these typefaces up in FontLab and reconstruct them how I see fit (not
    to mention I am not a type designer). I can easily go and pick up my copy of Elements\u2026,
    re-read the Crystal Goblet or thumb through Frutiger's Caracteres if I wanted
    to use other typefaces.\r\n\r\nBut I just want a simple answer. Is that so wrong?
    If there isn't more refined versions of these typefaces available, then just say
    so.\r\n\r\nravel: You didn't even offer any assistance at all. What gives?"

    because there isn't a simple answer. \r\n\r\nAll of those will print clearly in
    offset. Beyond that answer, it's a matter of suiting the type to the project and
    the design for the project. There are a million + ways to go, and as Stephen said,
    for that people would need to know more about the project and the design ideas.

    They are not something you reconstruct just like that, especially that is not
    allowed to that and it is not simple to do it, and especially to do it right.
    \r\n\r\nLet's start with this, what feel, what effect you want to generate with?

  body: "Hi Easton,\r\n\r\nas you might know, [[Arial]] is a rip-off of [[Helvetica]],
    with cloned metrics. Its entire raison d'\xEAtre is a morally questionable one:
    avoiding license fees (further reading: <a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/articles.html\">The
    Scourge of Arial</a> by [[Mark Simonson]]). The only advantages that Arial acually
    might have over Helvetica \u2013 a huge character set and good screen rendering
    \u2013 is probably irrelevant for your project. Hence, I\u2019d say the best Arial
    for print is a Helvetica. Which one? Well, opinions do vary. [[Neue Helvetica]]
    is cleaner, more consistent across the weights. Some prefer the classic Helvetica,
    just because of its quirks. <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/55088#comment-330962\">Others,
    again, praise the URW digitization</a>.\r\n\r\nTimes Ten has [[oldstyle figures]]
    and [[small caps]], which makes it a more versatile and dapper choice than the
    system TNR. More information in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/42524\">this
    thread</a>.\r\n\r\nCourier might be the hardest nut. The digital versions of both
    [[Courier]] and [[Courier New]] don\u2019t perform very well in print (nor on
    screen), to say the least. There are so many good alternatives \u2013 if you really
    want to go with a typewriter/monospace for \u2018extended texts and poetry\u2019.\r\n\r\nHaving
    said that, it is not clear to me if you are looking for the best versions of Arial/Times/Courier
    that actually go by those names, or rather for good alternatives from the same
    genres. If the latter is the case, have a look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/\">Stephen\u2019s
    lists</a>:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/times_new_roman/\">Times
    Alternatives</a> \r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/helvetica/\">Helvetica

    width, which worked okay on screen (before ClearType and grayscale) but which
    renders very light on high-res output devices. You could go with the bold, or
    better yet pick another fixed-pitch font. '
