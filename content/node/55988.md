body: "I am trying to find the origin of Albertus Extra Bold. There are a few digital
  fonts out there - most of dubious origian. I and a friend with much more reference
  material find no such critter in metal up through photolettering. Jaspert reveals
  that several variants of the original Albertus and Italic were added over the years,
  but no Extra Bold.\r\n\r\nThe earliest appearance I can find is a Font Company (defunct)
  font. Most of their fonts were apparently made for them by URW using Ikarus. Was
  URW in the habit of adding extrapolated weights to font families using Ikarus?\r\n.\r\nAlso,
  there was, it seems, an Albertus Extra Bold built into early HP Laserjet printers,
  but where did that come from?\r\n\r\nThe frustrating thing is that there are two
  very different \"models\" of Albertus Extra Bold that various companies followed.
  One was used by Font Company (via URW it seems) and Miles (gobbled up by Agfa).
  The other was used by Fontbank and Brendel. None of these companies (not including
  URW) created anything original so whose Albertus Extra Bold were they copying, why
  two different styles and, the thing I'm trying to deduce, which model came first
  and who designed it?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a sizeable showing (1/2 page at least)
  of an Albertus Extra Bold?"

    them. I'm sure they could let you know if there are Extra Bold drawings at Salfords,
    and if so these would be the \"original\" source. \r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertus_%28typeface%29 "

    \"SERIALS TYPECOLLECTION,\" which was how the Brendel types were marketed in the
    USA at that time. The marketer was B & P Graphics from LaGrange, Illinois.\r\n\r\nOn
    that CD Albertus was named \"Adelon\". There are roman and italic, in Light, Regular,
    Medium, Demi Bold, Bold, and (yes!) Extra Bold.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what the
    source material was. The poster that came with the CD says the fonts were \"digitized
    using the latest IKARUS technology.\" & I don't know much about Brendel and these
    types he re-worked and marketed. Or about B & P. I think there was a lawsuit.
    I saw no good in these faces. No ligatures, for one thing.\r\n\r\nBut I could
    make a showing of Adelon Extra Bold.\r\n\r\npowers"

    8, and practically every one of them was a piece o' interpolated garbag\xE9. Out
    of 40 cuts of a single typeface family, I would venture to say that maybe 8 were
    originals. Perhaps more or less, but the vast majority are interpolations."

  body: There were at least a few display film font versions of Albertus that included
    bolder weights, sometimes called "Albertus", sometimes not. For example, Headliners
    International had a family called Neo-Albertus with four weights from Light to
    Extra Bold. I doubt any of them were licensed or sanctioned by Monotype, as such
    things rarely were back in the film font days.

  body: "Thanks for all that info guys.\r\n\r\nSo, Mark, I mentioned that the existing
    digital version of AlbertusXB seemed to follow two very different models. Here's
    what I mean:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AlbXB_5012.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    should clarify that what are actually shown in my image are AdelonXB - with Anthony
    being very similar, but not exactly the same - and Miles' AlbertusXB - with the
    Font Company's version being quite similar.\r\n\r\nMy question to you is which
    of the two models, if either, do you see in those earlier AlbertusXB film fonts?
    I just took a look back at the many ID requests on What The Font that turned out
    to be AlbertusXB and most were made by a film or digital font that looked like
    the Miles/Font Co. model.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Origin of Albertus XB: I do have a Scangraphic Font Index from 1989 that
    shows Albertus with 5 weights, including an \u2018Albertus Extra Bold\u2019. My
    URW Type Program from 1992 lists \u2018Albius\u2019, the URW clone of Albertus.
    The family looks very similar to the Scangraphic version. They are not the same
    as your Miles/Font Company sample though. Also: Neither the Scangraphic nor the
    URW catalogue shows a weight of Albertus that looks like the Fontbank / Brendel
    sample.\r\nAlso I have a Brendel Informatik catalogue called \u2018faces\u2019
    which contains \u2018Adelon\u2019 Light\u2014Extra Bold, a family of six weights,
    indicated as \u2018similar: Albertus\u2019. That catalogue is from around 1990.
    The bold weight is wider than the Miles / Font Company sample. Many details, such
    as the counter of the lower case o, are different,. The extra bold weight resembles
    the one you list as Fontbank / Brendel. \r\n\r\nAccording to what I find in my
    catalogues, I think that Scangraphic digitized their Albertus from \u2018artwork\u2019
    which was taken from a catalogue from an American headliners company. Scangraphic
    paid license fees to Monotype back then, but for reasons unknown to me, Scangraphic
    never digitized from Monotype artwork. At Scangraphic, many typefaces were digitized
    from Berthold Staromat 2\" strips as supplied by their customers :\u2013) They
    were usually switching from Berthold, Linotype or other systems and often insisted
    on the availability of particular typefaces on the Scantext system before the
    deal was closed. Many of these typesetting houses also had large collections of
    headline fonts. Some of them belonged to Brendel\u2019s Type Shop chain, so some
    of the typefaces \u2018needed\u2019 by our new customers may origin from the Type
    Shop collection as well. Berthold and Linotype did not have Albertus in their
    library, so the Scangraphic type studio must have  taken it from another source.
    We had several headline catalogues, could have been VGC, Headliners or the like.
    That was done before 1987 when I started to work there, so I cannot come up with
    anything more precise. In the early years Scangraphic did not have an Ikarus system.
    When they switched from bitmaps to outline font technology, they had many typefaces
    digitized by URW. From the catalogue numbers of Scangraphic and URW, I think it
    is likely that URW digitized Albertus from artwork supplied by Scangraphic. The
    Font Company was a kind of subsidiary of URW who generated and distributed (PostScript)
    fonts from the URW typeface library in Ikarus format. Still, that does not explain
    the origin of the Miles / Font Company sample.\r\n\r\nThe second possibility would
    be that Brendel once digitized Monotype Albertus from whatever source, extrapolated
    a light and a black weight from these, polished them up a bit and then re-interpolated
    the family. This is how most of the Brendel typefaces were made. A closer look
    at Adelon Light\u2013Bold suggests that this may have been the case here too.
    But that story does not explain the design of the extra bold weight. The extra
    bold weight is quite different from the rest of the family (top serifs, overall
    width, contrast). After URW and Brendel split up, URW had some of the first Brendel
    typefaces in their Ikarus library. But the early URW catalogues do not show Albertus.
    Ergo: URW obtained Albertus from Scangraphic and not from Brendel.\r\n\r\nAround
    1990, Monotype had some of its major typeface families digitized by URW. Like
    Scangraphic a few years earlier, they also had to quickly change from a bitmap
    based typeface library to outline description. Typefaces such as Times, Plantin,
    Gill Sans, Bembo and Rockwell were in that package. But I do not recall that Albertus
    was amongst them. Also, that does not explain the bold weight, especially not
    the lower case. Monotype does not have any bold weights of Albertus that are as
    bold as these are. "
