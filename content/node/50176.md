    in <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/43442\">this thread</a>.\r\n\r\nThis
    time I had to dig deeper!\r\nVoil\xE0: The masthead on the <a href=\"http://www.anothermag.com/\">AnOther
    Magazine website</a> states that all its font design is by <a href=\"http://www.alias.uk.com/\">Alias</a>
    ([[Gareth Hague]] and [[David James]]). This typeface isn\u2019t listed on their
    site, so I\u2019m afraid it is custom.\r\nYou\u2019ll find a few alternatives
    in the older thread. Also in this vein: <a href=\"http://www.pfadfinderei.com/07beta/fonts/fonts12.html\">Nicola</a>
    by [[Critzla]]. None of them is really close, though.\r\nF"
