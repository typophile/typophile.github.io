  would pick as the essential Art Deco typeface. Something not too gimmicky and decorative,
  but has the right feel. \r\n\r\n?"

    much covers the basic definition of \"Art deco\", though I'm not sure I agree
    with Benguiat gothic.\r\n\r\nFor a nice little article and some examples, try
    Fonts.com:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/aboutfonts/articles/fyti/01-01-2005.htm\r\n"

  body: 'That fonts.com list is good but I think most of that Linotype set are wrong.
    Arnold Boecklin Regular is an earlier Art Nouveau style. Charles Rennie Mackintosh
    is more Arts & Crafts than Art Deco. I''d say only ITC Manhattan is classic Art
    Deco, & even that is a 1970''s revival. '
