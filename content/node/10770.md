body: Ok, so I got my local ex-letterpress guy  <BR>&#40; he now die-cuts &#41; to
  let me poke around  <BR>his warehouse at a date of my choosing. <BR> <BR>In the
  corner of this rather large space under  <BR>a layer of dust and dust bunnies there
  is  <BR>a linotype machine, several letterpress machines, <BR> wood and metal fonts
  and two or three cases  <BR>of block plates of logos, dingbats, flurons,  <BR>boarders,
  monograms and who knows what else. <BR> <BR>Now, while all of this stuff seems a
  treasure  <BR>to me, it is the block plates that are  <BR>of particular interest
  to me now. When I had  <BR>the chance about three months ago to dip  <BR>my fingers
  into case one, in was obvious  <BR>that many of these were twenty, thirty and  <BR>even
  forty and fifty years old. When he bought  <BR>the place many of these blocks came
  with it.  <BR>My estimate is that there are between 300 and  <BR>900 of these total.
  <BR> <BR>This is my objective. To bring a stamp pad,  <BR>plenty of paper and when
  I get there, stamp  <BR>away. He has agreed to let me do this. <BR> <BR>So I am
  wondering if anyone has had any  <BR>experience in archiving this kind of thing
  and  <BR>if any advice, before I head in, could be  <BR>offered. I don&#39;t expect
  to make my trip for at  <BR>least another week. <BR> <BR>Paper choice is a major
  concern. And since I <BR>have no blocks to experiment with myself in  <BR>the meanwhile
  is a simple ink pad going to  <BR>work well enough? <BR> <BR>-smc

  body: 'Sean: From my limited experience in making block prints without a letterpress,
    I think that results from a stamp pad are going to disappoint you. You might be
    better of picking up a pound of <a href="http://www.graphicchemical.net/block.html"
    target="_blank">black relief ink</a> and a <a href="http://www.graphicchemical.net/brayers.html"
    target="_blank">brayer</a>. The ink&#39;ll be tackier and, I think, give you a
    better impression.  <BR> <BR>Try placing the block face up, rolling out a thin
    layer of ink on a peice of plexiglass or lexan, inking up the block, placing the
    paper on top of it, and burnishing it with the back of a wooden spoon &#40;er,
    make-shift baren&#41;. It&#39;s the white trash way of ancient Japanese woodblock
    printing.  <BR> <BR>You could also try using a &#34;galley&#34; or &#34;proof&#34;
    press if there&#39;s one laying around the shop.  <BR> <BR>Good luck. <BR> <BR>Nathan'

  body: Hrant&#39;s definitely right that galley proofs aren&#39;t worth a heck of
    a lot. For that matter, my trailer-park-Hokusai method isn&#39;t going to be absolutely
    stellar. If you&#39;re planning on archiving these things <a href="http://www.oneart.com/cgi-bin/briarpress/showcuts.cgi?uid=default&amp;home=1"
    target="_blank">digitally</a> though - i.e., if you just want something to trace
    a vector image of - I think that either one would be OK. If you really want to
    archive them on paper though, you might want to fire up a small platen press if
    there&#39;s one available. If you&#39;re not that familiar with letterpress, I
    think it&#39;d be easier to get decent prints off a platen &#40;e.g., C&amp;P&#41;
    than a flatbed &#40;e.g., Vandercook&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Nate

  body: Hmm. Inking up, printing, and cleaning hundreds of blocks would definitely
    take an inordinate amount of time. The advantage of a proof press is that it&#39;s
    pretty simple. Just a flat bed that your galley &#40;or block in this case&#41;
    sits on, and 2 rollers that you pull over the paper. Essentially like block printing
    but with rollers instead of a baren. Faster than a hand baren, but with uglier
    results.  <BR> <BR>To be honest, if you&#39;re not looking for top quality prints,
    learning how to lock up a few blocks at a time in an old platen press wouldn&#39;t
    be too hard. It&#39;s pretty easy to pull a print - pretty darn hard to pull a
    good one. I&#39;m no Gerald Lange, but if you&#39;re interested I could email
    you some pointers.  <BR> <BR>Incidentally, below is a pretty standard proofing
    press. Simple little beast, innit. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7785.jpg"

  body: '&#62;Are better prints pulled from  <BR>the latter?  <BR> <BR>Lord almighty,
    yes. Proofing presses, traditionally, are used for pulling proofs of &#34;galleys.&#34;
    A galley is a tray that a typeset page would sit in, after being composed, before
    being printed. So the proof, like Hrant said, is just for layout/proofreading.  <BR>
    <BR>Cylinder presses are the real deal. I&#39;ve got a &#34;platen press&#34;
    &#40;see pic below&#41; that I think would be easier to get the hang of for a
    beginner than a cylinder, although rumor has it that they don&#39;t produce the
    same quality.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try to throw a simple How To sort of thing together
    for you. It won&#39;t make you a great printer, but hopefully it&#39;ll help you
    lock up and print those blocks. Sounds like a terrific project. <BR> <BR><img

    target="_blank"> this link</a> and look under &#34;Getting started&#34; and &#34;Guides/tutorials.&#34;  <BR>
    <BR>Also, Lange&#39;s book is of course excellent, but I wouldn&#39;t worry too
    much about understanding <i>everything</i> in it before I printed those blocks.
    A lot of it is geared towards using new materials &#40;i.e., photopolymer&#41;
    and it sounds like you&#39;re talking mostly about wood and/or copper. <BR> <BR>Two
    different worlds in my opinion.

  body: 'smc <BR> <BR>Sounds like a project. I&#39;d say Nathan has guided you well
    here. The best blocks to reproduce would be any with a copper face. These would
    be older than zinc or magnesium faced blocks and would repro much better as their
    detail is much finer. Rubber stamping won&#39;t do unless you are just using it
    for identification purposes. The use of a traditional hand buren is difficult
    and the spoon technique is probably worse than rubberstamping.  <BR> <BR>The galley
    proof press could work well if you are somewhat skilled with a brayer. A lot of
    these galley proofers are Vandercooks &#40;Model O&#41;. But they are not the
    sophisiticated models that come with registration and inking mechanisms.  <BR>
    <BR>Best would be a Vandercook equipped with these &#40;any of the Universal or
    SP models are the top of the line&#41;, as these were specifically designed for
    exacting reproduction work. At the end of the commercial letterpress era, these
    were used by type shops to repro metal type for the photo offset folks. We did
    a lot of repros for folks intent on digitizing these faces at one time. We even
    did a couple of repros for Doyald Young&#39;s first book. <BR> <BR>Most likely,
    in that shop you are messing around in there is a platen jobber, as in Nathan&#39;s
    last photo. &#40;Nice looking press by the way.&#41; This would do the job as
    well, but the reproduction quality would not be near what you could get with a
    properly adjusted Vandercook repro press. The platen jobbers are quite beatific
    to work on but I think it a bit easier to learn on a Vandercook as the makeready
    and inking concerns are less formidable to a beginner. The Vandercook is also
    better for bookwork, if for no other reason than it has a relatively massive bed
    size. <BR> <BR>Best to take a workshop on letterpress before you engage in this
    project. The blocks themselves are becoming quite valuable, especially the copper
    faced. A search for letterpress items over at eBay would give you an idea of their
    relative value. <BR> <BR>FYI: I&#39;ve got a group site on contemporary letterpress
    practices at <BR> <BR><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PPLetterpress" target="_blank">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PPLetterpress</a>

  body: 'Thanks Gerald. You know, I always thought that platen presses were easier
    to run, but that&#39;s probably because I&#39;ve done very little with Vandercooks.
    Thanks for clarifying my misinformation. <BR> <BR>Also Sean: it <i>would</i> be
    a really good idea to take some sort of workshop before you get started on this.
    If one&#39;s available near you. If you do want some fast instructions on simple
    platen operation, I&#39;m totally willing to get something together for you. But,
    again, it won&#39;t get you ready to pull great prints. But it should work. <BR>'
