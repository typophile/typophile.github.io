  body: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Neutraface, because the counter of the R is more
    normally proportioned than Neutraface, which has a very large counter. Neutraface
    also has pointed apexes &#40;apices?&#41; on the M, which this sample doesn&#39;t.
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/granby/" target="_blank">Granby</a>
    is one font I can find that has the high-crotch M, and that style R &#40;which
    Gill Sans doesn&#39;t have&#41;. Nobel, which also has that M, also has a different
    R. TF Forever, is also a possibility, but may be a bit more condensed. <BR> <BR>I
    will stick with Granby as my guess, since this image is rather hard to see clearly.

  body: If you&#39;re trying to reproduce the graphic I think <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/more.html">
    Gotham</a> would be your best bet. It is very close to the type face in that image.

  body: I agree Gotham has similar characteristics. Another is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/transport/d-bold/testdrive.html?s=THE%2BFARM&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">URW&#39;s Transport</a>, and it&#39;s a relative bargain, compared
    to Gotham.
