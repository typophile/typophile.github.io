  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>In light of yesterday&rsquo;s unveiling of its Macbook Pro (with Retina Display), seems like good time to restart this question:
What do you see as the future of TrueType hinting? The short-term value is obvious. I get it. I&rsquo;m with you.
But when breaking out the checkbook, how do we measure the value of hinting in the context of improving rasterizers, iOS&rsquo;s limited appetite for hinting, screen resolution, etc.?</p>
<p>This is an honest question, not a statement. It&rsquo;s a wonderful, daunting, inspiring, confusing time of possibilities and pitfalls. 
Love to read some thoughts on this, in light of Apple&rsquo;s news. Many thanks.</p>

<p>In a way, not much at all. But it&rsquo;s not so much about the new Mac. It&rsquo;s the wave other other manufacturers that will race to compete. Apple now has raised the bar on screen display. So where will that leave us?</p>

<p>I think the biggest impact of the new hi-res screens is going to be how pixels are seen by web designers. Up till now, a pixel was a fixed measurement, equal to a point (on most screens). Whereas in print, pixels (or printed dots) have always been of different sizes and therefore irrelevant as far measuring things goes, in the world of the web, the length of something in pixels has always dictated how big it is, in terms of real-world size (inches, etc). Now, finally, that will have to change, as 220 pixels on one screen will be the same actual size as 72 pixels on another. The only difference will be that the first is a higher resolution — an attribute that now, for the first time on the web, is independent of actual size.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m waiting to see a paradigm shift where web designers will have to specify the size of things in real-world terms, and let the browser sort out how big to make each pixel. In other words, the concepts of &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; and &ldquo;size&rdquo; on screen will start to be understood more like the way they always have been in print.</p>

A dreadful prospect, looking at history of browsers’ consistency…
<blockquote>the concepts of "resolution" and "size" on screen will start to be understood more like the way they always have been in print</blockquote>
To me it could be the opposite: in print you have the page, with its “real world” fixed dimensions and a somewhat fixed “resolution”. Screens will never give you neither of those.</div>

<p>I might be wrong, but I think that on the MacBook Pro with Retina display that resizing (to compensate for the higher resolution) is done by the operating system, not by individual programs like browsers.</p>

Correct -- up to a certain point, at least.
On an iPad 3, if you used 'regular' interface commands, dimensions in "pixels" are silently doubled. However, if your software generates a bitmap in memory and copy it "manually" on to the screen, the image will be too small.
<p>Frustratingly, Apple still calls their old resolution &ldquo;1 pixel&rdquo; &ndash; to make sense of high-resolution coordinates you are now supposed to deal with &ldquo;1/2 pixels&rdquo; as well!</div>

<p>Joshua, thank you. This is another thought that keeps me up at night (in a good way). What is the impact of responsive design and relative type sizing on hinting? I don&rsquo;t know enough about the mechanics of raterizers and the way they trigger font meta data. But seems to me the scenario would be the opposite of the way you describe. No? In responsive design, there is no real-world fixed size. Everything is relative.</p>

They would not be legible if displayed at an arbitrary resolution where 1 pixel in the image translated to 1 1/8 pixels on the screen.</p>
<p>Therefore, specifying image sizes in inches, for example, is not an option, since then, although the images might be legible enough on a very high-resolution display like the Retina display, they wouldn&rsquo;t be legible on different resolutions (60 dpi - old Macintosh, 72 dpi - common Windows, 96 dpi, 144 dpi, alternate Windows) on conventional computers.</p>
<p>Instead, Apple&rsquo;s current solution, of having a real pixel be equal to 1/2 or 1/4 of a virtual pixel, does work.</p>
<p>Ideally, in future, I would have to change how I specify image sizes, but how it would be done would be to specify image sizes in pixels, but then also note a base screen resolution: above twice that resolution, each pixel would be replaced by an integer number of pixels.</p>
<p>i.e., if I specify the base screen resolution as 72 dpi, then at resolutions from 144 dpi to 215 dpi, each pixel becomes a 2 x 2 square, at resolutions from 216 dpi to 287 dpi, each pixel becomes a 3 x 3 square, and so on.</p>
<p>That would combine resolution-independence with the ability to control the relationship of image pixels to screen pixels.</p>
<p>Naturally, for things like photos, it should also be possible to specify image size in inches, where resizing will not injure visibility.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There is some confusion here. At least with iOS and OSX, there is no &lsquo;thinking different&rsquo; (pun not intended) about pixels for web designers.</p>
<p>Designing something 10px square in mobile Safari, and setting type to 8px will result in the same physical sized elements on a retina display as on a non-retina display.</p>
<p>As previously stated, this is because apple now treats a &lsquo;pixel&rsquo; as a more virtual concept. On retina displays, it uses 4 device pixels to render the one &lsquo;code&rsquo; pixel.</p>
<p>So, generically speaking, a web designer has to do nothing to accommodate retina displays.</p>
<p>If they do want to give retina users higher resolution images (Again, displayed at the same size) there are a few steps they need to take care of, but it&rsquo;s nothing daunting.</p>
<p>What is frustrating for web/mobile designers, however, are the other high-density screens being developed that don&rsquo;t do what Apple does. Instead they just use smaller pixels. Some of the BlackBerries do this and it causes issues in that the designer sees everything smaller on the device compared to the iPhone so insists that we resize everything for the BlackBerry. However, they often fail to realize that EVERYTHING is smaller on that user&rsquo;s BlackBerry so the user has already likely taken steps to change the defaults to their liking to begin with.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that high density screens are going to cause weird problems going forward&ndash;at least until all OSes start using resolution independent rendering. But Apple is the one place where we shouldn&rsquo;t see too many problems.</p>

<p>Thanks David. I&rsquo;m referring to a check written to a talented type technician to hint an non-TrueType hinted font. That&rsquo;s a sizable expense. I&rsquo;d hint my alpha-bits if I could, but increasing screen resolution makes me wonder how sharper screens will affect the value of intense hinting and the ability to justify the investment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a type designer. I&rsquo;m a type user. The fact is, outside of the type designer/provider universe, there aren&rsquo;t many people who can intelligently weigh in on hinting conversations. So I value the feedback I get here.</p>
<p>Screen resolution may not be a strong consideration when designing your typeface, but isn&rsquo;t it something you consider when making the decision to invest lots of time and resources at your foundry to add hinting information? If better screens improve the display of the typeface, that would seem to lessen the motivation of designers and publishers to invest in hinting. Wouldn&rsquo;t that affect your decisions?</p>
<p>Likewise, there are third parties who can do this work well (WebType, Typekit, etc). I imagine the service they provide would lessen a designer&rsquo;s urge to invest heavily in hinting.</p>

<p><em>Yes</em>, high resolution screens will, or just might, make low-level hinting obsolete. But not every screen you see around you is, or will be in thefuture, a high-rez screen. There will always be a market for properly hinted fonts, I think.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;ll make a nice niche market, one day, when there are just a few experts left that can make fonts good looking on any screen.</p>
<p>As for iPad 2 vs. 3 differences: images that were scaled in e-pubs, to either a certain scale of the total width, or a certain size in pixels, opened up on the &lsquo;3 at &hellip; half their size! In Real World measurements, of course. Another thing I noticed was that same text in (supposedly) same size spaces <em>just a tiny bit</em> differently on the &lsquo;3. Tiny bits add up, though, on an entire line. So it seems subpixel alignment was not translated into half-subpixel alignment (or double-subpixel, perhaps).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but you&rsquo;re way off base here.  Technologies judged as inferior by the masses become obsolete quickly.</p>
<p>As soon as the market recognizes a truly superior and readily available technology, all the money will switch over to that.  Nobody will care about your 15 year old mint condition monitor. If the new fonts don&rsquo;t work on your system, the response from Support will be, &ldquo;oh well, buy a newer computer.&rdquo;  This is just the reality of markets.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t be the first to question some of the terminology adopted by the W3C for their CSS specifications. ;)</p>
<p>Té&rsquo;s 96ppi comment <em>is</em> related to the spec. The W3C refers to a &lsquo;reference pixel&rsquo; in the latest working draft:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/">http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/</a>
&ldquo;Note that this definition of the pixel unit and the physical units differs from previous versions of CSS. In particular, in previous versions of CSS the pixel unit and the physical units were not related by a fixed ratio: the physical units were always tied to their physical measurements while the pixel unit would vary to most closely match the reference pixel. (This change was made because too much existing content relies on the assumption of 96dpi, and breaking that assumption breaks the content.) &quot;</p>
<p>Granted, it&rsquo;s still up to browsers to decide what to do and not all care. For instance, there are several high-density BlackBerry devices where the pixels are simply smaller. Which is unlike the iOS reitina implementation where the &lsquo;real&rsquo; pixels are much smaller, but the &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; pixels remain the same offering a more predictable rendering in terms of physical size.</p>
<p>At some point the operating systems/OSes will have to just do away with the concept of pixels altogether (at least from the perspective of the content authors). As we approach much higher density screens, adopting a resolution independent system would make more sense. That way 1&rdquo; = 1&quot; regardless of the particular screen. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. Low level hinting is already obsolete without the high resolution hardware, because the latest Apple, Microsoft and Libre font rendering system software can render unhinted fonts well enough.</p>
<p>The issue is that the old Microsoft rendering system software (&ldquo;GDI&rdquo;) is hard-coded by many Windows applications - so the new DirectWrite system software isn&rsquo;t used even if it is available (c.f. Google Chrome today)</p>
<p>I expect plugging in an Apple Retina screen to a Windows 8 computer that is running such &lsquo;legacy&rsquo; software is unlikely to render text any better than the previous screen. The Retina display drivers will use 4 or 8 hardware pixels to represent 1 pixel in legacy software, so it will look the same as it always has.</p>
<p>Because that is what businesses want; change on their schedule, which might be never.</p>
<p>When you peek at the computer on the checkout stand at the grocery store, you&rsquo;ll often see a Windows 7 computer running a VT100 terminal emulator with a UI that looks like this:</p>
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Linux-menuconfig.png" />
<p>If the software using GDI rendering is updated to use DirectWrite, then even on old screens an unhinted font will render fine.</p>
<p><em>But when breaking out the checkbook, how do we measure the value of hinting in the context of improving rasterizers, iOS&rsquo;s limited appetite for hinting, screen resolution, etc.?</em></p>
<p>If you are going to pay for hinting, my suggestion is to make a contribution to the <a href="http://freetype.org/ttfautohint/">http://freetype.org/ttfautohint/</a> project and use it to bridge the gap between now and the time when most people are no longer using applications linked to GDI.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Um, Joe, you are correct. I think the solution to the problem at hand finally dripped down into my skull (akin to Chinese water torture).</p>
<p>W3C indeed uses &ldquo;the pixel&rdquo; as a valid measurement unit, so you can ask for an image to be sized 44 x 30 pixels (either in HTML or through CSS). If the pixel were not a valid measurement unit, this would not be possible!</p>
<p>However &ndash; dropping upon me like a bone thrown into the air by a careless simian  &ndash;, <em>it depends on the browser</em> how this value gets interpreted. So in my example screen shot, using Internet Explorer on Windows, this <em>only</em> tells us that Windows treats a given pixel unit as &hellip; real-world pixels. It does NOT tell us say anything for my current reading platform (Safari per iPad 2) and it won&rsquo;t tell us anything for the same on an iPad 3. Wait &ndash; I feel an experiment coming up. &hellip; Okay, when I go from landscape to portrait mode, your avatar scales down a bit.</p>
<p>Resuming? When we are talking about pixels, do we henceforth have to refer to &ldquo;W3C pixels&rdquo; (as shorthand for &ldquo;1/96th of an inch&rdquo;, just like the nominal point is &ldquo;1/72th of an inch&rdquo;) and &ldquo;device pixels&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Oh, and BTW, I think the idea of pixels being &ldquo;actual&rdquo; and corresponding exactly to each and every illuminated dot on the screen took hold mostly because the unit of measurement is named the same as the illuminated dot but also partially from a misunderstanding about &ldquo;relative&rdquo; units versus &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; units in the Cascading Style Sheets spec.
Yes, the pixel unit is a &ldquo;relative&rdquo; unit, but not in the same way as an em or percent. The pixel is relative to the size and resolution of the physical screen, whereas the em or percent is relative to the computed size of the parent element within the HTML.</p>

<p>Correct. From the CSS3 spec (March 2012):</p>
<p>&ldquo;For print media and similar high-resolution devices, the anchor unit should be one of the standard physical units (inches, centimeters, etc). For lower-resolution devices, and devices with unusual viewing distances, it is recommended instead that the anchor unit be the pixel unit. For such devices it is recommended that the pixel unit refer to the whole number of device pixels that best approximates the reference pixel. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reference pixel is the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96dpi and a distance from the reader of an arm&rsquo;s length. For a nominal arm&rsquo;s length of 28 inches, the visual angle is therefore about 0.0213 degrees. For reading at arm&rsquo;s length, 1px thus corresponds to about 0.26 mm (1/96 inch). &quot;</p>
<p>Based on the responses, I&rsquo;d say this is the pure form of the truth, but there are real-world implementation compromises.</p>

<p>A circular argument.
The stuff about the angle and reading distance is redundant, a pleasantry, methinks.
Also, if the reference pixel is an angle, it’s not precise, as the 28&rdquo; could be either to the edge of the pixel, or the centre—which are different distances (assuming the pixel has a ﬂat surface).</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the reference pixel browsers should (but may or may not) adhere to. And one based on a desktop screen. Which is hardly the norm anymore, so likely not all that useful. Alas, W3C recommendations take quite a while to flow through the pipeline.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David: <em>But how come we need anything at all between font master ppm and device dpi?</em></p>
<p>The CSS3 pixel isn&rsquo;t between font ppem and device dpi (at least, no more than the point or the millimetre etc. can be said to be between them). In fact, it isn&rsquo;t a pixel at all in any physical or raster understanding of the term: it is just a new reference unit of measurement, like a point or a millimetre, by which the font outline is to be scaled and then rasterised to the closest approximation given the ppem and the device resolution. The only reason it is called a pixel is that the goal of the new definition is for user agents to be able to take all that old web content spec&rsquo;d in px units and make it big enough to see on higher resolution displays. It is easier for W3C to make the px unit device independent than to require web developers to rebuild their sites using existing device-independent units.</p>

<p>Did anyone ever mention to the web consortium that type works best when it scales non-linearly? and that at the bottom and the top of the actual size scale this non-linearly is relatively precipitous? Just a thought:)</p>

<p>I mentioned it to them, complete with illustrations (CSS3 briefing, TypeCon Los Angeles, following webfonts working group meeting), and everyone agreed that my non-linear, size-specific type looked very crisp and legible, but that having text reflow when zoomed is a non-starter. So unless you&rsquo;re going to make a distinction between scaling and zooming &ndash; i.e. a distinction between what happens to the type depending on <em>how</em> it is made bigger/smaller &ndash; there&rsquo;s going to be zero uptake for non-linear biggering and smallering. Put it another way: user experience of blocks of text at variable sizes trumps user experience of reading text at particular sizes.</p>
<p>Once again, I&rsquo;m not endorsing this view, just reporting it.</p>

<cite>WYSIWYG is a succubus.</cite></p>
<p>I would like it if one could use word processors in a mode that allowed the body copy to flow automatically, so that one could change the point size of a whole document and just check that everything worked out right, instead of reformatting each page&hellip;</p>
<p>Think of old-style text formatting programs - such as the one that still survives in Unix, <strong>troff</strong>.</p>
<p>However, for a word processor to let you see what your printout is supposed to look like, so that you can minimize your use of paper, instead of making multiple printouts during the revision process, is, I would still say, a <em>good</em> thing, not a bad one, even if there are technical challenges in bridging the gap between the screen and the printer.</p>
<p>Recently, it was the lower resolution of the screen that was the problem (requiring the problematic technical solution of hinting), in the past, when many people used daisywheels instead of printers, or when laser printers had their own fonts (actually still true of specialized ones today) WYSIWYG (of course, that <em>phrase</em> has an offensive origin, so in the very early days, they risked insulting secretaries by using it in their presence), at least when proportional spacing was used, had problems in the other direction - the computer had to be informed about the metrics of the font used within the printer, as it couldn&rsquo;t impose the screen font it was using on the final copy.</p>

<p>“…non-linear, size-specific type looked very crisp and legible…”</p>
<p>Oh no, that’s not the point.</p>
<p>“…having text reflow when zoomed is a non-starter.”</p>
<p>Text reflow, having it and stopping it are entirely up to the developer and/or user.</p>
<p>“…So unless you&rsquo;re going to make a distinction between scaling and zooming…”</p>
<p>Resizing, is a lot like reflow in that its ways of happening and whys are up to the developer and/or user.</p>
<p>“…there&rsquo;s going to be zero uptake for non-linear biggering and smallering…”</p>
<p>It’s already taken-up big-time by the public in both old and new media.</p>
<p>So, in general, we’re reading a 3-yr old report that says “if non-linear scaling from a single font file were allowed as an option, no one would be safe.”</p>
<p>The problem comes with “responsive media”  vs. “Write HTML pages, post HTML pages, view HTML pages. Adjust. Repeat.”…</p>
<p>…(on either end of the point size spectrum),  without “responsive type”  as the resolution spectrum is attenuating, according to this thread&hellip;</p>

<p>Really? This conversation again? Yeesh.</p>
<p>Posted elsewhere:</p>
<p><a href="http://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2010/06/apple-retina-display/">http://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2010/06/apple-retina-display/</a></p>
<p>“So, if a normal human eye can discriminate two points separated by 1 arcminute/cycle at a distance of a foot, we should be able to discriminate two points 89 micrometers apart which would work out to about 287 pixels per inch. Since the iPhone 4G display is comfortably higher than that measure at 326 pixels per inch, I’d find Apple’s claims stand up to what the human eye can perceive.”</p>
<p>See also:</p>

<p>Long short, there’s only so much detail the human eye is physically capable of detecting. Sure, if we get in an look at the type 1 cm away we’ll see a difference, but at 12 inches, ~300 DIP is our threshold. Beyond this neither resolution nor hinting make a significant difference.</p>
<p>Take the hint. It’s pretty much dead (and before you say it, yes, there will always be a crappy ATM in a third-world country airport).</p>
<p>It’s also important to point out that the people arguing for the importance of hinting are quite possibly the most biased population you could ask. The bulk of them stand to proﬁt from its significance. You’d be hard pressed to get a type designer who gets paid to hint to admit what they do is makes no significant difference aesthetically, in measures of human performance, and will eventually become extinct.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve no problem with the notion that hinting gets less relevant at higher resolutions and will eventually be either unnecessary or easily automated for the kind of resolutions we&rsquo;re looking at in an increasing number of mobile devices. But we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also point out that hinting isn&rsquo;t just a technology for making type look nice in otherwise friendly conditions, which seems to be all you&rsquo;re thinking about. Hinting is also a tool for addressing frankly unfriendly conditions, such as inherited vertical device metrics. We spent a lot of time over the past year trying to squeeze ten Indic scripts into the vertical metrics of a Latin UI font &ndash; don&rsquo;t ask! &ndash; and hinting was essential to the process of making the forms legible at target ppem sizes.</p>
<p>Its not like we&rsquo;re going around the place selling hinting services to people who don&rsquo;t need them, Christopher. Clients come to us because they discover problems that need hinting solutions.</p>

<p>For example:
In standard screens, concave stems becomes visible at about 40px or up.
In retina, you see the concave effect at 16px.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to remove anything, but below a certain threshold details becomes invisible.  In retina, instead, that threshold is much smaller and much more details are now visible (for good or worst :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Christopher, your data is flawed, as is your interpretation. One thing consistently ignored by the &ldquo;300 dpi is enough&rdquo; people is that we have two eyes! And this could very well translate to (and anecdotally does seem to translate to) much more than a mere doubling. See the end of this page for an example:

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I would tend to think that 300 dpi is enough <em>for a display</em>, because we know from our experience with laser printers that while 60 dpi is crude dot-matrix printing, 300 dpi seemed indistinguishable from the product of fully-formed character printers.</p>
<p>Of course, it is also true that this initial impression was flawed, because 300 dpi was still a tad fuzzy, and certain types of subtle detail in some typefaces - notably the flared stems of Optima, for example - were lost.</p>
<p>But in a display, unlike with a laser or ink-jet printer, one can control the color of each pixel exactly. So if one combines a technique like Microsoft&rsquo;s ClearType with a 300 dpi display, which, unlike hinting, can be carried out in an automated fashion, I think the results will meet any reasonable standard of <em>adequacy</em>.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s anything <em>wrong</em> with pursuing higher resolutions when the technology gets to the point that they will be easily available, but it does mean that at 300 dpi, there will not be any <em>pressing</em> need to seek further improvements in display resolution&hellip; and, thus, there will be a disinclination on the part of consumers to pay premium prices for higher resolutions beyond this level.</p>
