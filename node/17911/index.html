<div class=commentbody>Where did they get the red from?!
Down here down under (Australia), "Salt & Vinegar" or "Salted" crisp flavours are usually represented by purple (sometimes blue) packaging. The old Walkers package used Green for Salt & Vinegar? Isn't green usually reserved for Chicken flavours? I guess what I am saying here, are these colours localised? Are most Salt & Vinegar packs Red or Green over there in America? ;)
Yuk, by the way.</div>

<div class=commentbody>If i remember correctly a few years ago Walkers used blue for <em>Salt and Vinegar</em> and green for <em>Cheese and Onion</em>, but they suddenly switched them round, which confused a lot of people -- In England I've found a yellow/mustard colour is reserved for chicken flavors.
The new design isn't very kind to the eye, the READY SALTED doesn't fit in with the rest of the design, and i feel it overlaps the Walkers logo too much -- The old typeface had a more <em>traditional potato crisp</em> feel to it, the newer one is very American.
<b>Cerulean</b> could you post any images of the Doritos packages, i haven't seen any changes there yet; what do you mean by "Apparently even corn flour and cheese powder must be marketed as Extreme Global Digital... ..."

Go to <a href=http://www.fritolay.com/fl/flstore/cgi-bin/products_doritos.htm>this page</a>, on which you can see the penultimate Doritos design.

<div class=commentbody>In the US potato chip bag colors have changed a bit over the years but generally are Yellow for plain/salted, Brown to Black for BBQ, Cyan Blue for Salt and vinagar, and Orange for Cheese flavors. Of course there are zillions of other flavors, but those are the most common and long standing on potato chips in the US. Most other American chip companies seem to follow the lead of Frito Lay when it comes to the colors used on chip bags.
Cerulean - I like that old Dorito bag too, everything since is just too...
Geoff - Chicken flavors? On chips? Salt and Vinagar used to be represented by a Yellow-green, but it has recientlly changed to Cyan Blue, I think they needed Green for the Dill Pickle chip bag. I do think colours are localised, as well as spellings and tastes. Check out these:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IndiaChips.png]
Yes, those are real! Chatpata Chaska flovored Kurkure (tasted like Cilantro/Coriander on a Cheeto-like substrate) and Magic Masala flavored Lays. No BBQ or meat flavors in India.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I recall hazily that as a crisp consuming child in the UK in the 80s/90s, the universal standard was dark blue for ready salted (plain), cyan for salt and vinegar and green for cheese and onion and all the leading brands (Golden Wonder, KP, Smiths) which were near identical, followed this scheme.
Then Walkers swiftly rose to the top, the other brands disappeared or reappeared as "USP" brands (square/ridged/thick cut) and then Walkers then took advantage of their position to not only switch the Cheese and Onion and Salt and Vinegar colour schemes but also bring in red for Ready Salted.
Don't get me started on Marathons becoming Snickers, or Opal Fruits becoming Starburst.

other interesting 'crisp news' that UK viewers may not have picked up is that golden wonder went bust recently, a shame as they were the brand i used to eat when i was at school (before i worried about whether these things were good or bad for you) this is becuase of walkers, their buy-out by pepsico and their marketing tactics, before that they just one of many crisp companies in the uk.

<div class=commentbody>It used to be that "Salt 'n Vinegar" chips in the US invariably had the Union Jack featured somewhere in the design. Now it seems like blue dominates, possibly inherited from the old color schemes. This is the brand I usually get.

<div class=commentbody><em>...what were they thinking?</em>
a) It seemed like a good idea at the time
b) Newness for its own sake (novelty, or "a change is as good as a holiday")
<em>I was actually going to say that it seemed a bit Japanese’d to me - Americanized? I guess these days that’s getting to be about the same.</em>
We have had a rash of the same kind of non-sensical generic food packaging makeovers here in Australia, particularly potato chip brands and quickie-snack products found in supermarket freezer aisles. So I guess this dubious style isn't uniquely American.
For about the last 2 years there has been a lot of twaddle from brand managers I work with about brand positioning and re-positioning, niche consumer appeal and "leveraging" consumer products. It translates into lots of pointless and stoopid packaging redesigns.
Quite possibly the font used on the new Walkers package is an attempt to differentiate the brand from other potato chip brands that use a flair serif (as the previous Walkers pack did). Flair serifs are common on chip packets.
That, however, doesn't excuse the awful new font they've used. It isn't organic enuff for a food product. Nuts!
<em>Maybe they needed to stress the ready salted over the actual brand name. :^/</em>
:^) That is exactly the kind of thing I'm on about---brand sub-positioning and niche appeal. The brand image takes a back seat to the directive of some farcical "consumer focus group study".

<div class=commentbody><em>this dubious style isn’t uniquely American</em>
Yes I was wondering if it was fair to attribute this bland genericism just to US. I didn't realise that pointless sun/crisp thing was so widespread, everytime I see it I think of something going to repro with a missing picture.
<em>I’m still wishing we had that masala flavor here in the US.</em>
Tikka Masala isn't Indian, apparently it was invented in Glasgow when someone asked for "gravy" to go on their Tandoori chicken.
Mr Tayto at least has charm.

<div class=commentbody>My guess on the redesign had nothing to do with the packaging but with the marketing of no trans fats. That alone is a reason to change the packaging. The average consumer will think if its not bad for me, it must be good.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Those Utz look cool. At least the logo is pleasing.
In denmark the leading chips brand is called KIMs
See this link for a stupid web page http://www.kims.dk/
The guy appearing there is the main character in the branding through Kims Chips tv commercials. He is ridiculous.
