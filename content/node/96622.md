    is already in the market with the trademarked name Reading Edge Web Fonts. (Though
    I see that this is part of a larger Adobe Edge initiative.)

  body: "<em>>since Apple seems determined to reduce Adobe to irrelevance</em>\r\n\r\nThis
    is perhaps drifting off topic a bit, but Apple's reducing Flash to irrelevance
    doesn't really do too much to Adobe's overall dominance of the graphic industry
    which has me concerned. There is nothing at all to compete with the Creative Suite.
    There are some individual programs, but nothing even close to the integrated products
    of the Creative Suite. I've been concerned about Adobe shifting to a subscription
    model, which I really don't like and will cost me far more than an outright purchase,
    and the CS6 cloud is the beginning of the shift to a subscription only model.
    So what choice will any of us have if Adobe becomes an evil empire? Corel? \r\n\r\nFar
    from irrelevant, I'm worried about Adobe already being too relevant to my every
    day. \r\n\r\nAnd BTW Mr. Daniels, the Packers were TOTALLY ROBBED! It was an uncalled
    push off and an interception. I think the Packers should sue the Seahawks and
    NFL to get what lawfully belongs to them."

    about that, if you have kept up your upgrades. I expect that when a desktop app
    becomes only available as a subscription web app, the cost for those who bought
    desktop licenses will be lower, and the cost for <em>a lot</em> of the users who
    don't have licenses (or bough a license 15 years ago and never upgraded) will
    be higher. \r\n\r\nI think subscription models for proprietary software are great,
    because it makes it much easier to compare to the costs of libre software, which
    is best commercialised on subscription (eg RHAT)"
