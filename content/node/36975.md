  body: "The corrosion was not part of this typeface - but someone took pleasure in
    placing it upon the face. If you noticed the \"corrosion\" is different in the
    letters M, and also everywhere you see the letter N -- even the \"I\"s are different.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know what WIlliam Page 500 is - but if it is a typeface - then by all means
    use it - and have fun in Photoshop."
