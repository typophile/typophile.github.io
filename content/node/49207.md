  body: Haven't seen this one. Doubt it's available digitally. My guess is that its
    a custom design (perhaps a pattern was used) or from a photocompositor font. Similar
    digital fonts include <a href="http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000019">Fenway
    Park</a> and <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000111">Anaheim
    Script</a>.
