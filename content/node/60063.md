body: "Hello all!\r\n\r\nI formatted my CV to Grid. I would like some feedback. I
  have never done grid before and I feel I have trivialized it far too much. I also
  fear that I went with form before function, but I will leave that for you to decide.\r\n\r\nCurrently,
  it is at it is. I want to expound on my responsibilities underneath \"Experience\"
  because I want to make sure that my potential employer is aware that my tasks weren't
  vapid; that I actually did things. Also: If any of you are aware of what to properly
  include in an American CV, and see that I did not include that, please offer those
  thoughts as well. I am working on an 8.5in x 11in piece of paper, portrait, and
  am tempted to see if I can keep it one page. \r\n\r\nThis was done in InDesign.
  I used Lucida Fax which I have recently become fond of. It sits nicely. But that
  is up for debate as well.\r\n\r\nThoughts? "

  body: I would make the paragraphs under "Experience" align with its bar. I would
    not hyphenate in those same paragraphs.

    Can you explain? Are you referring to the visual element, the gray rectangles,
    that I used? \r\n\r\nEDIT: Okay I looked at it again and think I see what you're
    saying but I just want to double-check..."

  body: "YESH!!\r\n\r\nAs for the hyphenation: Are you referring to how I marked the
    time periods? Is that incorrect? Is it the symbol used or the style? If it is
    all incorrect, how should I go about marking how long I did them? "

    setting (ragged right) in short paragraphs would probably look better without
    hyphenation: Ad-missions Techni-cian\r\nAnd quite a few on the right\r\n\r\nAs
    for the time period spans, an en-rule would be better than the hyphen"

  body: "I would suggest that you use not only an en-dash to separate a range, try
    a \"thin\" space (Command-Shift-Option-M in InDesign) instead of a full space.\r\n\r\nI
    would definitely turn off hyphenation in the paragraphs below \"Experience\".
    It might also help eliminate the \"orphan\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans
    in the second paragraph.\r\n\r\nEven though the rule of \"never end a sentence
    with a preposition\" is no longer accepted as hard grammar, I find that ending
    a line break with a preposition, that is, separating the preposition from its
    object, makes scanning more difficult. Try keeping prepositional phrases together
    if you can. With a r\xE9sum\xE9, you want it as scannable as possible. I might
    even consider (shudder) bulleted lists instead of the compounded sentence with
    all those semicolons."

  body: I suggest changing "information" to "Contact" (isn't the entire cv information?).
    Delete using the actual word "Address" and group all of your addresses under the
    bar, the same with your Education information. Your design makes sense with how
    you organized your employment, having the position in one column and the responsibilities
    under the gray bar, but to use that same treatment for contact info and listing
    your schools doesn't work. Or you could have the bars align with the left column
    and handle your name in a different manner. Your spacing is inconsistent, compare
    the white space from the bottom of the gray bar to the base line of "School Address"
    and the white space from the bottom of the gray bar to the baseline of "Saint
    Joseph" and same for third bar as well.

    embarrassed to say I didn't know this prior but this is perhaps one of the best

    Fixed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Also...</strong> Is the type choice acceptable? I was happy
    with it until I read that Lucida Fax was designed for... faxing. I think it's
    appropriate but a Designer may question me on it. "
