  The font I am supposed to use is \"Sabon\". It appears to me this font does not
  have the matching glyth set.\r\nIs there a workaround? \r\nIf this happens only
  once in a while I thought I could I use two glyphs that combined would be the missing
  one , in my case Glyph ID 84 + and GID 131. \r\nHow can I combine them or would
  it be better to recommend a different font altogether?\r\nThanks for your help!\r\nMiriam"

    a number of things...\r\nYour best bet is to modify the font itself, adding the
    required characters. Note that a given font's EULA might actually forbid that.
    But I myself find that particular restriction unethical, so would encourage you
    to do it anyway."
