  also in the critique section btw, and I'd like to know what you think of it.\r\n\r\nFirst
  version\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/expletus-sans-diacritics_6225.jpg]\r\n\r\nSecond

    a bit to the right) works for Polish. More Polish letters with acute: \u0107\u0144\u015B\u017A.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/57_6422.png]"

  body: I don't understand you. Does that small difference in placement really make
    a difference for Polish people? In your example IMO the acute seems to fall off.
    I'll have another look at the placement of diacritics in other typefaces.

  body: "In typography, small differences cause huge effects.\r\n\r\nI second Janek's
    advice. Optimal placement for acute and grave accents are not an absolute center
    alignment, as one can find in many fonts. Accents are slight dislocated towards
    its 'direction', exactly as Janek's sample. Although he talks about Polish, I
    can assure you the same applies to accents in Portuguese. AFAIK, this criteria
    also must be considered to other Romance languages \u2013 Spanish, French, Italian,
    Romansh, Proven\xE7al, Catalan and Romanian, amongst other less known.\r\n\r\nIf
    you will verify other fonts, please also remember that many were made by designers
    whose languages have rare or no diacritics at all \u2013 especially English, German
    and Dutch. It's normal to a person who does not uses a language with many diacritics
    not to identify the better placement for them. Take for example Meta Serif, a
    font widely regarded as excellent. Its acute and grave accents are very centralized
    and tilde is very heavy, making it unusable for high quality typography in Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThis
    is why we use Typophile to get help about these questions. There is nothing better
    than eye from people who use diacritics dialy to criticize its design.\r\n\r\nI
    suggest you to take a good look at Slimbach's fonts, whose diacritics are usually
    very good.\r\n\r\nAbout your design, diacritics themselves are OK except tilde
    \u2013 I find it very round to Expletus style. Vertical gap may be a bit wider
    for all diacritics."

  body: Thanks Freiberger. When I said small difference I only did so, because Janekz
    said that it would be ok for spanish, but not for polish people. It was just miscommunication.
    I do realise it's important to place the diacritics correctly. I'll have a look
    at slimbach's fonts. I don't see what's wrong with tilde though.

  body: "I think Janekz's comment has calligraphical connotation, I mean when I writing
    in spanish tend to accent slightly to the right (acute).\r\nI think it's more
    natural."

  body: "Jasper, I probably was not as clear as I should. Nothing is <em>wrong</em>
    with your tilde. I just have the opinion that it is very much geometric. It would
    combine more with Expluts style if you make its curves more open. But this is
    subjective.\r\n\r\nYou can benefit from this [[http://www.twardoch.com/download/polishhowto/intro.html|article]]
    by Adam Twardoch about Polish accents. If you plan to support Polish (and also
    Lithuanian) you need to include ogonek in your font."

    the positioning according to Myriad. I've used Myriad quite often already as a
    comparison for expletus, so it fits perfectly. I'll upload the new placements
    as soon as i can.\r\n\r\nThis article seems to have switched to Polish diacritics.
    I am planning to just make basic latin diacritics, since I want to release a pro
    version later with extended language support, more weights, SmCa, etc."

    useful. Collisions between f and dieresis are important in German and Finnish.

    text sizes, too, I suggest to make some of them a tad heavier. Especially your
    umlauts look too light/small to me. (to me, the tilde also looks very fragile,
    but I\u2019m not used to tildes, maybe someone who is could judge that)"
