  of certain Packard automobiles made in the very late 1930's and early 1940's?  A
  few samples are attached.  Would also appreciate hearing about any similar typefaces.
  \ I did search the Typophile forums prior to posting, and hope I didn't miss anything.
  \ Much thanks for any guidance. Kevin\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/One

    a very appealing font. I doubt that it was a font at the time, although someone
    might have subsequently made a font based on the letters.\r\nI can give you some
