body: Hello, <BR> <BR>I have a document in cmyk and want to change the entire thing
  to rgb, is there a simple way of doing this rather than going through each colour
  used throughout. &#40;InDesign doc&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>David

  body: Indesign is more of a collaging program than an art program unto itself. <BR>
    <BR>You can click on swatches to make them RGB. Then you could do a batch automate
    in Photoshop, converting the placed images to CMYK. It&#39;s very slick, try it.
    <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re ultimately going to export, you can continue to work in
    CMYK, then set the PDF or JPEG or whatever as RGB while exporting. <BR> <BR>What
    is the end result of this project?

  body: 'Just a warning: any automated CMYK to RGB conversion is going to be a bit
    off anyway, so doing it by eye may be your best bet. If you don&#39;t care, just
    shift-select the colors in the Swatches palette and double-click on one of the
    highlighted ones. The group options window will appear, then choose the color
    mode. I think that&#39;s it. <BR> <BR>There are color managment options you can
    choose, but that&#39;s a larger, separate issue.'

    I suppose this is only important if you use this.

  body: 'Neither RGB nor CMYK is an absolute space. That is, they both only exist
    in reference to some particular parameters. So any conversion you do becomes a
    color management issue. You can of course ignore the issue, but that doesn&#39;t
    mean that color management stuff won&#39;t factor into the conversion: it&#39;s
    just that you won&#39;t control it. <BR> <BR>Of course, depending on the nature
    of the job, this may not be particularly critical. <BR> <BR>To echo John B, what
    is it that you are trying to achieve by switching to RGB? How will this document
    ultimately be output or in what form will it be viewed? <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>
    <BR>T'

    GoLive. At the very worst you will have web compatable files you can use with
    whatever program you compose your website with.

  body: 'Thanks for all the replys, its an advert for a newspaper, but it turns out
    that one newspaper in particular has an RGB workflow. Ill be doing quite a few
    ads over the coming months and becuase most papers bar this one are cmyk, I was
    wondering if there was an option to just convert all colours to RGB. <BR> <BR>I
    dont know how common it is to have an RGB workflow, especially for a news paper
    but this is directly from their specifications sheet:  <BR> <BR>&#34;NO CMYK images,
    only RGB - Independent Newspapers maintain an RGB ICC Profiled Workflow.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>For the moment Im just going to export the ad as an .eps. and select
    the file as RGB when doing so. <BR> <BR>Thanks again, <BR>David.'
