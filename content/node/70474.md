  nastaliq kashida ligatures in Indesign CS5? I already have added lots of kashida
  ligatures, and now I am trying to make them \"appear\" automatically when space
  adjusted. So I read through opentype tags, and found <Jalt> table which does the
  job. Unfortunately, it is limited to only init, medi and fina forms... :(\r\n\"The
  jalt table maps the initial, medial, final or isolated forms to their corresponding
  alternate forms\"\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_fj.htm\r\n\r\nAlso
  I have seen another rare feature called \"Stretched Alternate\". But I am not sure
  what tag it uses in opentype. Any suggetions? :)"
