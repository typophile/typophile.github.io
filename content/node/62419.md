    to test Caslon, but am open to other serifs that you could point me out to...\r\n\r\nThe
    word is \"Luan\". It's the name of a client. We are trying to make the word a
    type-logo, and thought that a serif with a ligature in the u+a could be very interesting.\r\n\r\nIf
    you can name more fonts, I'd really appreciate it!\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Personally I think the ua logo idea is a really bad one. Really no reason
    for it typographically, and if you did succeed in using one in your logo don't
    you think it would be misinterpreted as a diphthong and cause the word Luan to
    be mispronounced?

  body: "I always understood ligature to be a  typesetting term. More that one glyph
    on a single type body. \r\n\r\nI never heard it used in relation to handwriting.\r\n\r\nI
    understand that an fi ligature solves the problem of the hood of the f crashing
    into the dot of the i (except in turkish). I also understand the fl and other
    f to ascender ligatures solve a spacing and color problem. \r\n\r\nI understand
    the dutch ij ligature because of how those letters are treated as a unit in the
    language. \r\n\r\nI see no reason why a u and an a have to be designed as a single
    glyph/ligature. There is no color or spacing problem to solve. What other use
    would there be? If you want to use it to design a logo than by all means go ahead.
    But I don't think you are going to find it in any character set in an existing
    font \r\n\r\nAnd just so you know where I'm coming from I always thought those
    ct and st ligatures to be an archaic affectation with no modern typographic relevance.

  body: I agree with that. Ligatures are meant to solve problems, not create new ones
    as in some of the examples above. Where do you stop? Are there any letters of
    the alphabet that are going to remain on their own? Ligatures for "ab" "bc" "cd",
    anyone? Scripts are another matter altogether, and should not be confused with
    ligatures in general.

  body: 'A ligature (noun) is a characteristic of typesetting systems: a single glyph
    representing more than one character. To ligate (verb) is a characteristic of
    writing: the act of joining two or more letters together in some way. It follows
    that a ligature may or may not represent ligation, and ligation may be represented
    by means other than a ligature. From this flows much confusion. I''d say that
    Boris is looking for examples of ligated <em>ua.</em>'

    rather depends on the text. I would agree that these forms are no longer appropriate
    to book length texts, simply because readers are not used to them; there was a
    time when they regularly appeared in book typography, so they can't be considered
    inherently inappropriate: they're just inappropriate now. But there remain settings
    in which they can be used sensitively and benefit typography precisely because
    they are out of the ordinary: they can signify out of the ordinary texts. And
    of course they can be used to deliberately evoke period typography."

  body: "Thanks for the nice set of comments, guys. Pretty amazing.\r\n\r\nI somehow
    find two discussions here: Typography as a function (with ligatures like \"fi\"
    that solve legibility issues) and typography as decoration (with ligatures like
    \"st\" which by no means solve problems, but yet add interesting touches for type-embellishment).\r\n\r\nOf
    course, a ligature like st/ct won't help in copy text, but if they are used in
    a logo or in short sentences, they could be the winning touch for a minimal site.
    Take a look for example at this one: www.pisto-magazin.de\r\n\r\nlabyrinthos:
    My client is a cardiologist with a deep interest in photography. He wants to build
    a minimal site to showcase his pictures, with a brief comment right below them.
    A blog. So we are designing a minimal, type oriented site that focuses on content
    and pictures. I'm attaching a preview of what we have now, everything is set in
    Helvetica (no more than two sizes), pixels are measured perfectly within a 930px
    grid, and so we need an interesting, yet not so disturbing, logo for the header.
    We thought that \"Luan\", in red (like in Pisto Magazine), will work. And thought
    that a ligature/swash for the \"ua\" could help even more.\r\n\r\nHere's the site
    we are working on: http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/5520/luancom20090928grid.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks!"
