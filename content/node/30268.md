  </strong>[[Johannes Gutenberg]] began experimenting with movable type designs.\r\n<strong>[[1438]]
  </strong>Gutenberg designed his first [[printing press]].\r\n[[1440s]]\r\n[[1450s]]\r\n<strong>[[1455]]
  </strong>Gutenberg produced the 42-line bible, the first book printed with movable
  type. Shortly afterward his financier foreclosed, sold the bibles, and became the
  first commercially successful printer.\r\n<strong>[[1458]] </strong>[[Nicholas Jenson]]
  went to Mainz, [[Germany]] to study type-casting.\r\n[[1460s]]\r\n<strong>[[1462]]
  </strong> Rebellion in the city of Mainz causes many of the typefounders their to
  flee (or be expelled). Gutenberg moves downriver to Eltville. [[Conrad Sweynheym]],
  [[Arnold Pannartz]], and Nicholas Jenson move to Italy.\r\n<strong>[[1465]] </strong>[[Conrad
  Sweynheym]] and [[Arnold Pannartz]] are hired by a monastery in Subiaco, Italy.
  Seeking to find a more Italian alphabet for their new employers (as opposed to the
  Teutonic blackletter type of their homeland), the two sought to research classical
  Roman literature. However they unknowingly were reading ninth-century transcriptions
  in Carolingian Minuscule and falsely assumed that this was actually an Ancient Roman
  invention, just like \"capital\" monumental letters. The two combined the two alphabet
  forms in text\u2014upper and lowercase\u2014just like we do today (actually, we
  only do it because they started it\u2026). The first italian \"Roman\" typefaces
  (like Nicholas Jenson's later work in Venice), borrowed this two-case innovation
  from the scribes.\r\n<strong>[[1469]] </strong>[[Johannes da Spira]] established
  the first press in [[Venice]].\r\n[[1470s]]\r\n<strong>[[1470]] </strong>Johannes
  da Spira died and Nicholas Jenson took over the press.\r\n[[1480s]]\r\n[[1490s]]"
