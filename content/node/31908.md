  below the baseline and I have to move them up to the correct position. Is there
  a way to paste then so they sit on the baseline.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_4166.jpg]"

  body: "Rachel, \r\n\r\nthe outlines appear exactly as they are placed in Illustrator:
    the origin point in FontLab Studio corresponds to the origin point in Illustrator.
    \r\n\r\nAll you need to do is move the origin point in Illustrator by drag-dropping
    the small rectangle where the horizontal and the vertical ruler intersect. Also,
    there is a section of the FontLab Studio 5 manual dedicated to exchanging drawings
    with Illustrator which I recommend reading. \r\n\r\nA."
