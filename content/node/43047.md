  body: Taste-makers in typography are often freelancers who buy their own type. For
    their sake, $10-$12.50 per font should be the price. The best model is Storm Foundry,
    whose pricing has always been that moderate and who owe much of their success
    to such a policy. Or Emigre, where complete families cost $99. Every day I admire
    new typefaces from boutique European foundries and then gag at their prices. They
    think big corporations are the cutting-edge purchasers, and they're not! Dolly--only
    three fonts, no bold italic, for $205? Meet my middle finger, Underware!

    on opening up all of typography to every young designer with strong fonts to offer.

    Let us know if you do, so we can grab them! And we look forward to seeing other
    designs from you! You're doing everything the right way.

  body: If you ever do decide to do a hyper thin weight it will be a ton of work to
    get it right. Also, like I said the user of such a face is likely to be in publishing
    and could afford more. That is my rationale for the pricing I suggested. Also
    I think your work is strong enough to carry that. And lastly I think this face
    looks like the kind of thing a magazine or ad agency would be keen to get their
    hands on at extreme weights. I could be wrong. You could ask the folks who would
    know what they think too. But obviously you must do what you think is best. This
    is just my idea about it.

    about MyFonts.com and their tracking. In their statistics numbers (for the Starlets
    and Best Seller lists, etc) do they count free downloads as \"sales,\" or are
    only the real-sales-for-money of the two priced-fonts counted?\r\n\r\nIf the free
    downloads don't count in these statistics, then the release method that you've
    chosen has been doubly effective! But even if the free downloads are included,

    In both lists they rank the top \"selling\" fonts, so I assume they only list
    sales not free downloads. I wonder though how they count sales ... Is a font family
    sale counted as one? I have also had a couple of multi-user sales. Is such a sale
    counted as one? They must have a secret google-like algorithm to calculate all
    this ranking stuff, but I don't think the free stuff takes part in it, otherwise
    all free fonts would be in the top 10 of both lists :-)\r\n\r\n "

  body: I am disappointed that I didn't catch this thread earlier. That font really
    is something else, I bought the set. Has this selling strategy worked enough that
    if you release the sans you would put it at the same price? or would you step
    it up so that the people who got hooked on the display will want the complement?
    It seems like those interested in the text font would be wealthier parties.
