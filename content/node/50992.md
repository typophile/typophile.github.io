body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'd like to get your feed back and suggestions on a logo I'm
  working on for a Education Program sponsored by a local public school system. I'd
  also like to get some general feedback on designing in education. I've designed
  for education programs before and I have a really hard time getting my clients past
  clipart and 'chalkboard' They love it... Does anyone have any examples of good design
  in education (I'm talking elementary-high school) or have any comments on what works
  well generally. \r\n\r\nTo the issue at hand. I'm designing a logo for a 'community
  learning center\" It's a center where kids can go after school to take classes not
  available in the ciriculum or classes to supplement their required courses. The
  name of the federal grant is the \"21st Century Community Learning Center\" The
  administrative folks call the program CLC. They want to brand the 2 locations in
  the town differently and they've chosen a train theme. 'Jefferson Junction' and
  'Lincoln Station.' So the logo needs to evoke EDUCATION and TRAIN. I've attached
  my concepts so far but I'm missing it. any Help?\r\n\r\ntr\xE9"

    drawings, hm.. it just doesn''t seem to fit with am elementary - high school age-group.
    I would go for the subway graphics kind of angle, key colours, bold sans, ideograms
    that kind of thing.'

    of MS Word clip art pictures of trains in my head. I guess that means I''m getting
    old. One other thing I was trying to achieve is I know that this logo will only
    be printed in black in white because of budget so I wanted to avoid using any
    color. '

  body: "Similar thoughts to Nicholas. For a train image I'd try a very simple monorail.
    Any track could then be a single bold line like a subway map. You wouldn't risk
    the \"bent ladder\" look of trying to draw a slightly more literal train track,
    as in the Pencil Tracks.png.\r\n\r\nThink more about the clarity of station signs.

  body: "Great insight. I'm working on some new versions. I really had no direction
    when I started this project so this helps a lot. One other obstacle I ran into
    with the first round of logos i did was, I was designing the logos in a \"train
    industry style\" So I was using colors and mimicking the style of railway signs,
    companies, stations etc. What I ended up with was a logo that looked like a railroad
    company logo. I didn't look like it had anything to do with education. I can't
    figure out how to capture that with out adding the clich\xE9 'kids holding hands,'
    or a book or a pencil.   "

  body: You have a difficult challange, imagery that will appeal to elementary students
    will not necessarily appeal to high school students. You need to simplify the
    design. Will both locations have the same programs? or will one cater to younger
    children and the other to older kids? What I mean is, can the two marks be related
    or do they have to match exactly? The train drawings should be more iconic, less
    cutsie. Play more with the typography, the faces you have been working with seem
    stiff and old-fashioned for this project. On the clc train version it was difficult
    to read Jefferson Junction. Push yourself a little more - have fun with these
    logos.

  body: Well is it communicating friendliness and education? If so then it's succeeding
    and therefore good, no? You might want to review children's books to see art styles
    that will be appealing to your particular audience.

    is really the 1) children and their families and 2) the\r\ngeneral public as this
    grant is intended to be supported by community\r\npartnerships but it's all about
    the kids and families getting more help\r\nto move them forward to be successful
    members of society.\r\nI think the logos you just sent are too cutesy (but maybe
    that's\r\nbecause I feel like you do about education art). \r\nBut, I do think
    your feedback has a point. \r\nMaybe the latest train you did could be may to
    look cuter and\r\nincorporated into the soaring tracks???\r\nThat would be a compromise.
    What do you think about that?\r\nWe have an advisory council meeting on Monday
    morning at 7:30 a.m. This\r\nshould be a good group to bounce this off of (except
    they know nothing\r\nabout branding).\" "

  body: 'Here''s the latest. I like where this one is going a lot better. it balances
    whimsy/playful look with out making it look like the smiling apple style above.
    Type face I''m not sure about yet. I like serifs for the project. Serifs say education
    to me. I think it''s from all the papers I''ve handed in in Times New Roman. The
    train car transition icon I think lends itself well to the project. Going from
    a child''s toy caboose to a mono rail engine car shows progress from childhood
    to modernity. The monorail rendering still needs some work. I want to keep it
    simple but I don''t want it to look like a boat. Thoughts '

  body: This is an improvement. Get some stock of trains to use as reference. I don't
    mind mixing an old fashioned caboose with a monorail engine but the drawings need
    to be better. Right now the engine resembles a polar bear. I think I'd also like
    to see the rectangle more elongated. The proportion is too close to the square.
    Your font choice is still too formal for the subject, go to some font sites, browse
    their samples and get inspired.

    tough and I totally saw the polar bear. I had a rendering that looked like a monorail
    but it was more detailed the the others and didn't fit, looked to much like a
    technical drawing. I think the last one was a step in the right direction but
    maybe tried to do too much. what about this 'little engine that could' inspired
