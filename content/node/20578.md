  to suggest me what's or what are the most similar current fonts to the original
  type from [[Aldus Manutius]]. (sorry for my English)\r\n\r\nthanks very much in
  advance"

  body: Hi Mariano, the current font most similar to Aldus' last roman is Poliphilus,
    that most similar to his italic is Griffo Classico Italic. Neither of these are
    entirely accurate.

    on Aldus is because in the next century Garamond and his co-horts surpassed what
    was done and so is deemed as a better set of bones from which to start.'

    quality of Garamond's output was certainly more even than Griffo's, but as designs
    his work just looks vacuous to me. I'd really be interested to know what people
    see in them. Griffo seems to have been much the more thoughtful and inventive
    of the two; and his masterpieces, the 1499 caps and 1503 italic, had no influence
    on the French, who stuck to reductively reproducing his 1495 roman and 1501 italic."
