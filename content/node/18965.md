  <strong>Nonesuch Plantin</strong> typeface; a short and superficial research shows
  it was a proprietary font for the Nonesuch press. The only book that seems to sport
  this exclusive little font seems to be <em>The History of Herodotus of Halicarnassus</em>
  from 1935 that fetches three-digit prices with book feti -- erm, collectors.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone happen to have this book or any other that might use Nonesuch Plantin or
  a reproduction of some sort? A photo of a specimen or a xerox of a page of that
  book? I am too curious in which way it differs from the good ole Monotype Plantin
  110.\r\n\r\nAnyone?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nKai"

  body: "Kai, the Clark Library over here has that book*. But: it's closed until October;
    you can't check anything out; and they don't allow scans... But you could probably
    pull off some digital photography. Plannig a SoCal trip?  :-)\r\n\r\n* BTW, UCLA
    has that title published in 1958 and 1962; and interestingly enough the translator
    was Harry Carter! Dunno if those are any use to you.\r\n\r\nBTW, didn't Monotype
    end up making a long-extender Plantin (too)?\r\nI know I've seen it somewhere.
    Unless it was in Tracy...  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    guess it is not so terribly important after all, especially if it was just a normal

  body: "> what I must interpret as an invitation\r\n\r\nSure. Just bring a sleeping
    bag.\r\nFor the Clark I mean - they have so\r\nmany typographic goodies, it's
    scary.\r\n\r\nActually I have a small stack of printouts of\r\nthings I need to
    look at at the Clark, and I'll\r\nadd this to it; when I make another trip there\r\nI'll
    try to check out how \"special\" this Plantin is.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I just checked, and Monotype did indeed -eventually- have\r\na long-extender
    version of Plantin. I found a sample (but\r\nnot a very good one) in Harold Berliner's
    compilation of\r\nclassic Monotype text faces, but I'm sure it's possible to\r\nfind
    a much better sample without much difficulty.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if it matters/helps,
    the \"long\" Plantin\r\nseems to have its extenders about 50% longer/deeper.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
