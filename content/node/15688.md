body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nThomas Phiney at the Adobe Typography forum recommended
  that I bring my problem here.  He suspects a glyph naming or encoding issue.\r\n____\r\n\r\nI
  need some help to solve a mysterious problem, PLEEZE!\r\n\r\nI work with a type
  designer who generates Mac Type-1 fonts with Fontographer.  I convert these source
  files to Type-1 and TrueType formats for Windows.\r\n\r\nFirst I use CrossFont to
  translate the data files.  Then I use FontLab 4.6 to re-map certain glyphs; for
  example, the euro symbol and ligatures not normally accessible by Win users.\r\n\r\nThen
  I set up families if necessary and generate both Type-1 and TrueType fonts.  I install
  the results with Adobe Type Manager Deluxe 4.1 and test them with various apps.\r\n\r\nEverything
  has gone fairly smoothly for about 2.5 yrs, until now...\r\n\r\nThe latest font
  has no other family members.  The FontLab settings are the same as always before:
  \ embedding=everything allowed, encoding=default, charset=Bitstream, euro symbol=0128/20AC.\r\n\r\nThe
  resulting TT font displays and prints perfectly with every combination of apps I
  have tested.  \r\n\r\nThe problem is only with the T1 font.\r\n\r\nWith PageMaker
  7 on Win 2000, it displays correctly.  When printed to file and distilled with Acrobat
  6, the font embeds--almost.  However, the euro symbol mis-maps to \"A dieresis\"
  in the PDF. The ligatures are wrong too, but I'm less concerned about them.  \r\n\r\nIn
  another test using PageMaker 6.5 with Acrobat 5 on a Win '98 machine, it works correctly.\r\n\r\nI
  have tried every encoding option available in the FontLab T1 export dialog--same
  result.\r\n\r\nPossibly Related Issues\r\n\r\nThe Mac T1 source font may be set
  up incorrectly.  When the Mac Roman charset is viewed at MyFonts (the vendor), the
  euro symbol displays as \"upper-case Eth.\"  According to MyFonts, the euro should
  be (and is!) assigned to 0219/20AC.  What's wrong?\r\n\r\nWhen printing the test
  file to disk for distilling, PageMaker 6.5-7/Win 2000 reports that the font cannot
  be embedded.  I learned yrs ago to ignore this FALSE error message because it happens
  almost daily with fonts I use routinely, even some Adobe T1 fonts.  The fonts ARE
  embedded, and they print correctly even when output by a remote imagesetter.  Does
  anyone else have a problem like this?\r\n____\r\n\r\nIs the embedding glitch a FontLab
  problem?  Or Win 2000?  Or PageMaker 7?  Or Acrobat 6?  Or ATM?  Am I missing a
  secret setting somewhere?  Or What?  I don't know where to start troubleshooting...
  \ This font cannot be offered for sale until this problem is solved.  Does anyone
  have a clue?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your help, Anna\r\n-- \r\nAnnaStudios*The Type

    Windows and regerating the font.
