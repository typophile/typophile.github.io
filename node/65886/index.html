  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>So I got to thinking that the at sign really shouldn&rsquo;t be aligned with the uppercase, since its primary use is in e-mail addresses, which are always correctly written in lowercase.</p>
<p>MS Character Design Standards however says:
<cite> Height alignment : Visually centers on the uppercase height, dependent on the typeface design.</p>
<p><cite>Spacing : Visually center between uppercase H and O. </cite></p>
<p>As an aside, this doesn&rsquo;t help me know what size to make the glyph and so I&rsquo;m not fitting its upper and lower extrema to any particular heights. Instead its top is around three-quarters of the distance between the x line and the cap line, and the bottom around the same between the baseline and the descender line. This leaves the /a/ part floating in space around the centre of the x-height, which looks fine to me. Any thoughts?</p>

I personally don&rsquo;t like the W made of two Vs simply overlaid either. In other words, we shouldn&rsquo;t be taking the etymological origins of symbols and letters literally in designing them.</p>
<p>But to me &ldquo;@&rdquo; has always been nothing more than an &ldquo;a&rdquo; with a circular swash, and the statement that you want people to see an &ldquo;@&rdquo; instead of an &ldquo;a&rdquo; makes as much sense to me as wanting people to see a &ldquo;©&rdquo; instead of a &ldquo;c&rdquo; in a circle.</p>
<p>Is it just me? Are there people who think of &ldquo;@&rdquo; as an independent symbol with nothing to do with &ldquo;a&rdquo;? Come to think of it, I see how people who have only ever typed &ldquo;@&rdquo; and never wrote it by hand may not ever make the connection between &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;@&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Maybe this comes down to the fact that I&rsquo;m more used to glyphs that may be confused with an overly-stylized &ldquo;@&rdquo;. Koreans (and Japanese, I think) often make use of circled letters, and Thai numerals or Japanese hiragana contain many symbols containing a circular-swash-like element. So to me, what distinguishes &ldquo;@&rdquo; from an array of other similar symbols—indeed, the most characteristic trait—is the central &ldquo;a&rdquo; component.</p>
<p>I remember seeing other Koreans writing &ldquo;@&rdquo; as simply a circled &ldquo;a&rdquo;. This is nothing more than anecdotal evidence, of course, but it shows that to some people the connection between &ldquo;@&rdquo; and &ldquo;a&rdquo; is really strong.</p>
<p>The situation may indeed be different for those who are not likely to use any other symbol that can be confused for the &ldquo;@&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, while I agree with the principle behind your suggestion, is there anything inherently unnatural about thinking of &ldquo;@&rdquo; as a swashy &ldquo;a&rdquo; symbol? Any more than thinking of &ldquo;©&rdquo; as &ldquo;c&rdquo; in a circle, for example? It&rsquo;s a convenient and intuitive way to think about the symbol, even for many non-English-speakers who have no idea that it is called the &ldquo;at sign&rdquo; in English. Take away the connection and we are left with a random scribbly hieroglyph that we&rsquo;ll never remember how to write. ;)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also curious how one would move the design of the &ldquo;@&rdquo; away from the &ldquo;a&rdquo; component and still make it recognizable as an &ldquo;@&rdquo; to those who rely on the &ldquo;a&rdquo; component to distinguish it from similar symbols.</p>
<p>Just to make clear, none of the atypical &ldquo;@&rdquo; treatments that Bendy found (from Roadway, Jana Thork, Perla, and Letunical) look like &ldquo;@&rdquo; to me. Just because in my mind &ldquo;@&rdquo; is inextricably connected to &ldquo;a&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean that just any &ldquo;a&rdquo;/&ldquo;A&rdquo; with a circular swash makes an &ldquo;@&rdquo;. But Bendy&rsquo;s own &ldquo;@&rdquo; design to me is a perfect example of what an &ldquo;@&rdquo; should be shaped like. I&rsquo;m curious how one would improve upon it.</p>

<p>To me, that is nothing to worry about, at least no more than one would worry about the &ldquo;d&rdquo; looking too much like the &ldquo;a&rdquo; when you take away the ascender. The circular swash means the &ldquo;@&rdquo; will never, ever be confused with an &ldquo;a&rdquo;. The focus should be on differentiating it from other circular-swashy characters, which admittedly isn&rsquo;t much of a problem for most westerners.</p>

<p>Like what?</p>
<p>And always, think about the context: the &ldquo;@&rdquo; sign&rsquo;s main role now is email addresses. when you see it in a tightly-packed string of alphanumerics, what are the chances that it&rsquo;s going to be confused for the copyright symbol, versus an &ldquo;a&rdquo;?</p>
<p>For example if you see &ldquo;<a href="mailto:nin@gmail.com">nin@gmail.com</a>&rdquo; and the &ldquo;@&rdquo; has a honking &ldquo;a&rdquo; in it, you&rsquo;re much more likely to incorrectly see it as &ldquo;<a href="mailto:nina@gmail.com">nina@gmail.com</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Thanks for this example. This makes much more sense.</p>
<p>I think we will agree that in the context of an email address, anything looking remotely like the &ldquo;@&rdquo; will immediately be recognized as such. But I still contend the expected shape for the &ldquo;@&rdquo; contains the &ldquo;a&rdquo; element, so that an isolated &ldquo;@&rdquo; without the &ldquo;a&rdquo; component may be tricky for some to recognize.</p>
<p>Some similar symbols, off the top of my head, include the Thai numeral one, one form of the Greek kai ligature, and possibly some Hiragana syllables. But really, you have to understand how fond Koreans are of using circled letters (both Hangul and Latin) and numerals to see why I am even talking about this. In everyday handwriting, these may well take on forms similar to the &ldquo;@&rdquo;, with only the central components distinguishing one from the other.</p>

If a new at-sign were developed just for E-mail, and displaced the old one among the easily available characters on a computer (otherwise, E-mail would become more difficult to use on older computers!) then when one used a computer for word processing as a typewriter, suddenly ASCII would no longer contain the old at-sign for commercial correspondence.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that nowadays adding a character is trivial. Just go to Windows Update and downlaod a patch to your keyboard arrangement&hellip; and new fonts&hellip; and, presto! the new character prints on your screen and on your laser printer when you type ctrl-alt-5 or some such thing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Brian – very good point that transforming a character into what is essentially a catch word glyph is quite limiting in terms of cultural/language context.
Still, in principle I think it&rsquo;s interesting and refreshing to see a designer going about making this character differently – who said they need to always share the same structure (that&rsquo;s certainly not &ldquo;progress&rdquo; either). Plus, it&rsquo;s an alternate.</p>
<p>BTW, I missed this the first time round:
<cite>&ldquo;<a href="mailto:nin@gmail.com">nin@gmail.com</a>&rdquo;</cite>
Reminds me of how people actually tried to capitalize on the formal closeness of &ldquo;@&rdquo; and &ldquo;a&rdquo; for a while, back when email was still a new and exciting thing. I even know somebody who registered <em>the part of her name that follows the first &ldquo;a&rdquo;</em> as a domain name, so she could have an email address that was simply her name with that &ldquo;a&rdquo; replaced by an &ldquo;@&rdquo;. :-<br>
It&rsquo;s certainly very fortunate that that isn&rsquo;t really done anymore. The close association of &ldquo;@&rdquo; with &ldquo;a&rdquo; seems to have waned largely by itself, maybe simply due to the fact that the &ldquo;@&rdquo; symbol has grown to be seriously relevant, and is now largely &ldquo;understood&rdquo; as a character in its own right. All the less reason to make it look too much like an &ldquo;a&rdquo; if you think about it that way (but maybe also less reason to <em>completely</em> redefine its design…).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just yesterday, I saw a Korean write down her e-mail address making the @ an &ldquo;a&rdquo; in a circle. Now that I think of it, I&rsquo;ve noted in the past looking at sign-up sheets and such that this is how the vast majority of Koreans write the @ in e-mail addresses; I was the type geek who insisted on a proper connected @ form. I can&rsquo;t even recall seeing another Korean who writes the @ like I do, although surely I can&rsquo;t be the only one.</p>
<p>The lesson, I think, is that we should keep in mind that how one sees a character is often more culture-dependent than one might think. Something to keep in mind when we discuss the designs of glyphs like the @ or numerals, asterisk, daggers, and such.</p>
