body: Hi everyone, hope this is the correct place to post this (the typography/composition
  forum seems inactive). I am involved in creating a flash website for a client and
  am trying to pair a header font with a good legible choice for body text. The header
  is set at 18pt Brauer Neue Bold. The client likes the body set in Brauer also but
  I find it is somewhat hard to read. I have made a mockup below with it set in 14pt
  Brauer Neue and also in 12pt Helvetica Neue. I was wondering if anyone has a favorite
  or maybe even a suggestion for another font that would pair nice with the Brauer
  header. Thanks so much![img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_3414.jpg]

  body: The color of the text is too dark! Think contrast. If you want a second typeface
    i would pair Brauer with a Serif, Helvetica looks dull in this combination. Think
    contrast. BTW Brauer is not that bad, instead of messing around with a second
    typeface go with Brauer and try to improve the reading comfort. Color contrast,
    line-length, eventually spacing, rendering options inside Flash for dynamic text,
    etc.

  body: Hey thanks, I guess I should have posted a more accurate background color,
    the color is actually a brown. I just used the black background on the mockup,
    I will certainly look at the things you mentioned. I find the idea of pairing
    with a serif very interesting. Anyone else?

  body: Brauer looks much better than Helvetica. As for a serif, I would try Melior.

  body: I would also suggest trying Verdana, a safe bet when having lots of text on
    screen, then again you may want to think about breaking that paragraph up as well.
