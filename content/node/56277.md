  body: "Pretty early, I believe, and I think an interesting thing to research would
    be whether this or similar methods were used to differentiate o and 0 in manuscripts
    prior to the advent of type. Arabic numerals, including zero, were in use in parts
    of Europe in the 12th Century, and the similarity of o/0 was causing problems
    for scribes long before it became an issue for printers. Charles Burnett's <em>The
    introduction of Arabic learning into England</em> has some discussion of this,
    and illustrations of early English manuscripts incorporating 0.\r\n\r\nModern
    accounting was largely invented in renaissance Italy, and I would be inclined
    to look to see how 0 was written in manuscripts related to bookkeeping.\r\n\r\n\r\nAh,
    just remembered that I have a copy of G.G. Neill Wright's <em>The writing of Arabic
    numerals</em>, which includes some charts showing development of mediaeval numeral
    forms in Europe. There are certainly examples in which the 0 seems consciously
    drawn as a circle, although without so obvious a change in contrast as seen in
    type. In some cases the circle is quite small relative to the other numerals.\r\n\r\nIt
    is interesting to note that the inclusion of a slash to differentiate the 0 is
    very common in these mediaeval forms."

  body: For quite a long time, even to math academics, zero was stubbornly considered
    "not a number". This is probably why the circular nought, in its function as a
    "placeholder" in decimal notation, was consciously drawn more like a <em>symbol</em>
    than a numeral. The no-contrast treatment often found in old style figures is
    in keeping with other mathematical symbols like +, =, >...

  body: Great stuff all. Thanks as always. Probably the next step is to ask Hendrik
    Vervliet what he knows about specific type faces.
