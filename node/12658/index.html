<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>First I want to say hi to all of you since ive never posted, but kept reading this forum like an addict.
Second.
A friend of mine is in the trouble of choosing a new font as well as developing all the new road signals etc (señalectica in spanish) for our home state, she requested my help in choosing the right font, first I thought researching on legibility issues etc. Looking for Info on what has been done here in terms of typographic choosing.
Here is the problem.
Which way to go in terms of research
This proposal has to be run fast in order to keep the client
What do you masters of typography think would be the best font choosing (suggestions, fonts, criteria, foundrys).
How much would it cost licensing an existing font for this matter?
Thanx in advance. And Im glad I have done my first post.
Sorry for my english.

<div class=commentbody>Your friend is in trouble. ;D
It sounds like there is no time to make a custom typeface. Choose a typeface with several weights, clear numerals, nice open spacing, with letters clear and different from each other. Maybe your state is not too conservative? Your friend may have success proposing another style of typeface. Typefaces I suggest comparing:
Chianti from Bitstream
Cronos Sans - (smallest size masters) from Adobe
Stainless from FontBureau
Felbridge or Zemestro from fonts.com
Aroma from FontShop
Ask the type foundry about the price of licensing a typeface to a state government office.
To save time, your friend can learn a lot by reading about the development of Clearview, which was done for highway signage in the US.
http://www.clearviewhwy.com/
http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/clearfont/
This is enough to give your friend a lot of useful information.
I doubt your friend will need to supply such a large number of weights and widths.
Most important:
Much more letterspacing than for print
Clear, open letterforms (like Frutiger, not like Helvetica)
Large x-height (but not like Avant Garde)
Strong, even strokes and terminals (like Frutiger, not like Optima)
Your English is very good. Good luck to your friend, and please report back how the project turned out!
Carl</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tnx for the comment, I was thinking to suggest frutiger NEXT as the typeface since it has been actually used for signage before. State It´s not that conservative at least now theres this cultural thing going on throughout. Really thank you. '
I'll let you all know how the project goes. A custom font should be the answer however I understand theres no time for this. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Crossgrove gave some great links. Another typeface suggestion, you might consider, is <a href=http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/Parisine>Parisine</a> from Porchez Typofonderie. Originally designed for the wayfinding system of the Paris Metro. An added bonus to this would be also licensing <a href=http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/ParisinePlus>Parisine Plus</a> which has more flourish and could be used to add a softer alternative for certain settings. Also, you can read the history of this lovely and useful typeface <a href=http://www.typofonderie.com/gazette/articles/parisine>here</a>.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Gill Sans. It is very legible from a distance and it is omnipresent. A simple font like Franklin Gothic heavy might also work.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Makote,
Faced with the same dilemma, I'd look to the masters (and all of them are still living).
I would strongly suggest you look up the works of master of systems typographer [[Erik Spiekermann]]. He's overseen the type systems for Berlin's street signs, the public transportation signage and system for Berlin light rail and underground metro, the identity and type for Berlin's postal service. His latest project (still underway?) is for the German (Berlin?) railway. (Good thing I'm not a professional journalist, because I don't have to check my sources. I'm sure someone could correct some of these facts, but the net result is the same.)
The overwhelming feeling I got in Berlin was that I'd been transported to Spiekertown. His commercially available fonts (for signage and wayfinding) include FF Transit, FF Info, FF Meta--<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fonts&startrow=1&records=20&currpage=1&totalrecords=76&searchby=designer&searchID=824&searchletter=A&fontRendererText=Yo+quiero+Typophile%21">view all the Spiekerfonts here</a>.
Carl already recommended <a href="http://www.terminaldesign.com/retail_specimen.php?ID=1001&viewFam=1">ClearviewOne</a> which is as comprehensive in weights and options as any of Spiekermann's. (Designed by [[James Montalbano]].)
Then there's the ubiquitous <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&startrow=1&records=20&currpage=1&totalrecords=13&searchby=&searchID=&searchletter=&searchstr=interstate&font_categories_checkbox=font_name_search&fontRendererText=Yo+quiero+Typophile%21">Interstate</a> from New York designer [[Tobias_Frerejones|Tobias Frere-Jones]].</div>
