body: "Hi there ! :)\r\ni've spend a few hours to find in the web something similliar
  to this font used in logo of some racing parts manufacturer. It is sport/race typography,
  but its hard to find something realy close to this finest&dynamic emotion. This
  options (links below) are to far from original font:\r\n[[http://www.fontyukle.net/en/Unispace-Italic.ttf]]\r\n[[http://www.dafont.com/ageone.font]]\r\n[[http://www.dafont.com/sf-quartzite.font]]\r\n[[http://www.dafont.com/magenta.font]]\r\n[[http://www.fonts2u.com/criminal-italic.font]]
  that one have this nice indentations.\r\n\r\nIt can be commercial fonts of course,
  but there is a million small&big foundries :) After some searches at Linotype i've
  giveup :)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/lightscale-font.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\nlet
  me know any Yours suggestions!\r\nbests\r\nMarek"

  body: "Hello Ryuk!\r\nFirst i want to say a huge \"THANK YOU!\" :)  Your comprehensive
    answer is very helpful in achieving my task. Your examples, after combining them
    together, will help me achieve what I intended. Compilation of Bullet and Aachen
    is a perfect way (fits for just a few letters - the company name)\r\n\r\nTip of
    BuroInk is helpful but also sad too :) Their 'heuron' contains something very
    close in character to what I intended.... A more elegant and sexy than fast&sporty
    'lightscale' .. I'll try to ask them. Perhaps they have to rely on some commercial
    typeface. If not, I should look for a slightly different expression for my ideas.
    Closer to Aachen and maybe to more friendly image.\r\n\r\nAnyway, tomorrow i will
    ask them and will see. I'l be back :)\r\n(sorry for my english:)\r\n\r\nregards\r\nMarek."

    isn\xB4t based on a regular font. Its letters are custom drawn for the client
    (same as Heron). Roadies is a custom too.\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nMarkus"

  body: "I've tried to identify it some years ago with no success. Came up with nothing
    enough close to imagine starting a customization on. Most probably a custom job.
    I'd compiled some kind of list though, probably out of interest: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rory/|Rory]],
    [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/bullet/fontspecimens|Bullet]], [[http://www.dafont.com/nolo-contendre.font|Nolo
    Contendre]]. For what it's worth, if I had to do it now, I would probably start
    with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/aachen/|Aachen Medium]], manually
    slanted and probably redesigned almost all letters starting with /o and /c.\r\nDesigner
    in charge of [[http://bueroink.com/ink/#25|Lightscale design]] was Markus Sch\xE4fer
    ([[http://bueroink.com|B\xFCro Ink]]). He has designed some other (custom?) logotypes
    in the same vein ([[http://bueroink.com/ink/#12|Heron]], [[http://bueroink.com/ink/core/user/uploads/various-logos/logos_02_roadies.gif|Roadies]]).
    Try asking him directly and if he answers, drop some lines here.\r\n"

  body: "Hello Markus! (and Ryuk!)\r\nSorry for my disapeering (it's hard work this
    summer). \r\nMarkus, thanks for your answer! I've supposed that, but my idea going
    to more rounded, less sportive impression (I'll tray to customised one of this
    fonts from links above) so I hope it will not violate rights belonging to Your
    work.\r\nAnyway, if this project comes materialized, the end result of the work
    I show here, to make You sure that I do not have any bad intentions. If not, anyway
    I'll try to show here some sketch of concept.\r\n\r\nThanks again for Your answer
    and words. I admire quality of the work you're doing, one of the bests i've met.\r\n\r\nBests!\r\nMarek"
