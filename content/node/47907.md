  and PC apps. like Word and Wordpad.\r\n\r\nIn Adobe apps the font looks fine but
  in PC apps the stems are distorted, the vertical stems look alot thicker than they
  should do.\r\n\r\nOther weights in the family seem to working fine apart from the
  Thin weight\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any ideas what might be causing this ?\r\n\r\nAdobe

  body: That second one looks like Adobe Sans, the substitute font that loads when
    the font is not available. I think your font isn't loading correctly in Windows.

  body: Could be that you've got a "bold" style applied to the text, and it's only
    showing up on the PC... the second example looks a lot like a faux bold attempt
    (kinda like double-striking with a slight offset).

    apps. you might try a search here on typophile. '

  body: "It's not Adobe Sans, it just looks like it when it's not displaying correctly
    the font is loading but displaying strangely.\r\n\r\nI thought it might be the
    bold styling causing it but sadly it's not.\r\n\r\nI've used fontlab's auto hinting,
    will the hinting differ from application to application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
