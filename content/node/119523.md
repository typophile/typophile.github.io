  Avant Garde. I'm interested in identifying the pseudo-Russian/faux Cyrillic typeface.
  It's got to be phototype.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BK1539_6300.1L.jpg]

  body: "The key to this lettering is the \"gaspipe\" or \"stovepipe\" corners. Start
    with a font with about the right height to width ratio and similar weight that
    has fairly tight curves outside AND inside, such as Ryoichi Tsunekawa's Design
    System A 700 \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DesignSystemA700InUse1_6471.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DesignSystemA700InUse2_5322.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DesignSystemA700InUse3_5194.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DesignSystemA700InUse4_3549.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DesignSystemA700InUse5_6690.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/design-system/\r\nClip
    and paste stovepipe elbows as required. \r\nNote the final row. These are the
    glyphs  _3_, _4_ and _l_. For _E_ you could start by flipping _3_. For _Y_ you
    could start with _4_. For _I_ you could start with _l_.\r\nFor _N_ ignore the
    round-top version and make a simple straight line _N_. \r\nOnly the lhs of _A_
    will take some curve-bending.\r\nDon"

    body: "Very helpful reply, donshottype. Design System A 700 has some pretty astounding
      similarities.\r\n\r\nThe sample could be custom. I should do a little more research
      about its designer and such. When I saw this thing at a book store, it threw
      me for a loop. Thanks for the help!"

  body: I looked around and guys like Paul Bacon and [[http://www.cruztypedesign.com/book-covers.html|Ray
    Cruz]] were working for Knopf in the 1970's. The thought of a type designer like
    Ray Cruz drawing the type in question makes sense. I can't imagine anybody other
    than a professional lettering artist being responsible for something so inventive
    and sarcastic.

    of the 1970s, you might consider asking Ray Cruz to confirm he did the TTSS cover
    or, if he did not, to suggest who the designer might have been. If you do find
    out, it would be interesting to learn the answer.\r\nDon"

  body: "I mentioned Ryoichi Tsunekawa's Design System A 700 in a previous post and
    suggested a recipe for using it's corners to make stovepipe elbows to approximate
    the letters.\r\nUnfortunately the result is very approximate. The curves are too
    gradual and the weight is too light.\r\nI created my own stovepipe elbows from
    scratch and constructed these letters and the rest of an alphabet based on my
    conjecture as to what I thought might work with this concept. I have no idea how
    the the designer of the Knopf cover would have made the rest of the alphabet.
    So here is a Tsar Poutine alphabet in use\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TTSS_SM2_6621.jpg]\r\nThe
    picture of poutine was contributed by Jonathunder to Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine#mediaviewer/File:Poutine.JPG\r\nThe
    letters might be hard to digest and are definitely not part of a healthy diet.\r\nI
    might release Tsar Poutine as a font someday, but it does not seem like a very
    remunerative project.\r\nDon"

      perfectly!\r\n\r\nMy thought is that every digital typographer's overall goal
      should be to give designers the freedom of having options. The more options
      there are, the more freedom designers have. Something as inventive and idiosyncratic
      as the original design/Tsar Poutine should definitely have a cushy spot in any
      designer's tool-shed!"
