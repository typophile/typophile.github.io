  thanks. Do you have any advise on letter spacing, I've been reading \"Letters of
  Credit\", Walter Tracy - which describes a system for correct spacing. The lowercase
  starts with spacing the \"n\" and \"o\" and then using the sidebearing values to
  space the rest of the characters. It states that the sidebearing for the \"n\" should
  be be half the distance between the uprights with slightly less on the right to
  account for the arched corner. This system seems to produce very loose spacing for
  me, does anyone else use this method, or are there others.\r\n\r\n\r\nR ;)   "

  body: "Rachel, \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that any method that is suggested is only a
    guideline, meant to simplify and systematise the process of spacing a typeface.
    Since every design is different, certain methods may not be useful; in fact, with
    very irregular designs, no method will be useful, except the most reliable one:
    your eye. The eye is the final arbiter, and Tracy mentions the exception about
    the right side of n because often that side of n can appear loose. There are exceptions,
    and only your eye will tell you what they are. It's all coming from what makes
    the most sense visually, so if a method doesn't seem to be solving problems, the
    thing is not necessarily to find another method, but to abandon all methods and
    rely on your visual discernment. \r\n\r\nType design is full of these caveats.
    Very little about type design is truly modular or mechanical."

    optical size is implicit in these decisions. What is a good spacing at 6 pt is
    not quite so good at 12 & less still at 36. It's all to do with what they eye
    likes as Carl said. There are many additional factors to think about. Rag set
    vs Justified & on & on.\r\n\r\nIn the event that your thread doesn't take off
    (or even if it does) you may want to look for more examples & finer points, disagreements
    etc. Do you know how to do a site search on Google? \r\n\r\nHere is some java
    script you can use in a bookmark.\r\n\r\njavascript:void(q=prompt('Search%20Typophile:',''));if(q)void(location.href='http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com'+'%20'+escape(q))\r\n\r\nIt
    goes in the place where the web site URL would normally go. Once it's in you can
    put your search terms in & see the debates that have already happened. See examples!

  body: "Just to chime in and further emphasize Carl's well worded point--\"Your eyes
    are the final arbiter.\"\r\nIf you try one of the methods you read about and see
    something seems a bit off, it is your eyes showing you the way. Learning to see
    is not the same as learning to look. Like any skill, the more you practice, the
    better you get.\r\nI would be willing to bet that all of the methods were developed
    by looking at spacing of successfully designed type. How was this type designed
    so successfully before a method was developed? Those designers had well trained
    eyes.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Rachel, for me studying the spacing in typefaces I admire is an essential
    learning process, beyond all the theories. With the same text in the display box,
    I switch back and forth between several fonts I admire as well designed and spaced
    and the one I am working on. That shows me pretty dramatically whether my efforts
    are working or falling short in meeting the dual goals of liveliness and even
    color.\r\n\r\nTo test whether the spacing is not just even, but appropriately
    loose or tight for the intended size of type, it is necessary to proof it by printing
    it out at the intended sizes. "

  body: "Speaking of even color, eventually you might also want to search Typophile
    for the threads where we debated the notion of Notan too. \r\n\r\nAnd also slightly
    related I saw a variation on Hoefler's spacing description in an old lettering
    guide I got via Inter-Library Loan. I suspect everybody else has heard of it already
    but if not : It described using dots placed like stones or pebbles between letters
    and then counting them to see if they are equal or nearly so to see if your spacing
    is good. I think that it was offered not as realistic way of working but as an
    analogy and as a lay & novice's method. "

  body: 'Not to ignite that debate again, but just to be clear about my own use of
    the terms, when I say ''even color'' I mean having not excessively dark  or light
    areas that pop out and disturb the texture of the type. I use ''good notan'' to
    refer to shaping the letter well so it has a certain vibrancy of both white and
    black. '

  body: I think it might be a very good idea to talk about color on the page overall
    & notan in the context of the letter relationships and word shapes. Obviously
    these things ( inescapably ) relate or bleed into each other, however I do think
    there might be a usefulness in your distiction. I also want to thank you for critiquing
    & challenging some the ideas I had in those old threads. It was quite helpful
    to me.
