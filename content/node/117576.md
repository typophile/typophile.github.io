  body: "I found the custom printer in Syracuse, NY, who created these letterpress
    invitations, and their inspiration gallery features another invitation that uses
    the same typeface:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bellafigura.com/letterpress-inspiration/\r\n\r\nIt
    appears to be an outline version of AW Conquerer (italic glyphs) designed by Jean
    Fran\xE7ois Porchez. It is available (seemingly for free) at typofonderie.com.\r\n"

  body: "There are nine AW Conqueror fonts. They are indeed free. If you do not already
    have a Typofondrie account you need to create one. You want the AW Conqueror Didot
    Light. The swash letters are called A.alt etc.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AWConquerorDidotSwashLetters_6452.jpg]\r\nI
    have no information on an outline version.\r\nDon"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AWConquerorDidotInlineG_4485.jpg]\r\nHere
    is G in the style of the outline font used in the invitation.\r\nThe recipe is
    to use a parallel lines feature in a program that can manipulate fonts, set the
    lines at 10 points in and 10 out, and edit to delete unneeded lines. To make the
    tangle of lines easier to handle, I did it in three stages: 1. 10 points out;
    2. 10 points in for the fill; 3. paste the cleaned up fill from 2. into the cleaned
    up outline from 1. I  used Fontlab. There are other tools.\r\nDon"
