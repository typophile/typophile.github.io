  ('Balance Books'), a Hungarian book series publishing mainly essays in philosophy
  and aesthetics,  as part of her thesis in graphic design. I thought this might be
  of some interest for people on Typophile as every cover features photographs of
  hand-made type. What you can see below are the final versions of the 12 covers.
