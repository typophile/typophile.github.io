  body: "Thanks defiantone. Pretty small to say with any certainty what it is. Also
    don't know what if anything was edited for the logo.  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hurme-design/hurme-geometric-sans-4/\">Hurme
    Geometric Sans 4 Bold</a> is somewhat of a match for all letters, except h where
    the tail may have been clipped.\r\nDon\r\n"
