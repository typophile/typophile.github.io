<p>Do all current mods live in the same time zone? That might explain some messages stay up for hours, where others are deleted immediately.</p>
<p>Another point is someone might want to ask Punchcut for a &lsquo;kill immediately&rsquo; button, as I understand removing a message can be quite involving.</p>

<p>Again, this veers into “You people suck” territory <em>really</em> fast. I have a list of a dozen steps Spamophile could take to bring itself into the late 20th century, but any suggestion that anything whatsoever is wrong with this place is greeted with nervous reactions from Europeans with poor English skills who somehow think what’s being proposed is elimination of the site. What should be eliminated are its unskilled operators.</p>

<p>In general I agree. However, I got online this morning and noticed obvious spam posts that were 10 or 11 hours old. Seems as if having a few admins in different time zones, plus some night-owls and morning people might help remove these more quickly.  I kind of view the spam posts as like graffiti –unless they are erased quickly they just encourage more.</p>

<p>Quick: From memory, name three Typophile “moderators.” (You can include Zara, a gimme.) Can’t do it?</p>
<p>Curiously, I can name all the MetaFilter admins from memory (mathowie, jessamyn, pb, cortex, vacapinta). Why is that? Well, I’ve been there ten years, which explains a lot. But what explains even more is the fact that they are real people who actively participate in MetaFilter. Plus there’s an entire MetaTalk section dedicated solely to discussions <em>of</em> MetaFilter. That is only one of the innovations Typophile should immediately steal, assuming its “moderators,“ and you people, stop acting all defensive. This site <em>has problems</em> that <em>need to be fixed</em>.</p>

<p>If Typophile is so awful, what are you doing around here, Joe? Hmmm?</p>

<p>It isn’t “so awful”; it’s just badly run.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A thing that is inevitable on the Web, I think, is that clear honesty and simplicity comes across as rude and angry, thanks to a total lack of intonation and familiarity with the person who says it and his or her standard vocabulary, and c. and c. So Joe may sound like a curmudgeon, and he may well be, but if you read it simply as clearly spoken criticism of a system ill-run, it is just a criticism. And you can do something with criticism, including learning from it, ignoring it and smearing your excrement all over it. I think we all know what the wisest way is.</p>
<p>P.S. Quick test: who of you think I&rsquo;m angry? Who of you think I&rsquo;m being clear? No smiley faces. They bring down the narrative like termites in moldy birch.</p>

<p>I can do it, and I&rsquo;ve met all of them, fine people every one, and passionate about type. What makes you think that regulars here are as unfamiliar as you with the moderators? How about acknowledging that you have been wrong about this?</p>
<p>By the way, both Dan and Paul started out as amateur Typophilers, and now are in the type industry, which I think is a testimony to how helpful Typophile is.</p>
<p>Also, if you&rsquo;d climb down from your high horse, you&rsquo;d see that Joe Pemberton put a link above to all of the moderators, so your challenge isn&rsquo;t exactly hard to meet.</p>
<p>You could put all of your criticisms of this site, and preferably specific suggestions for improvement as well, without using insulting language. That kind of thing I and I&rsquo;m sure others would welcome.</p>
<p>As it is, the tone of your comments is as welcome as a skunk at a picnic.</p>

<p>I think that the group is well moderated, and once the new spam wave subsides, all will be well again.</p>
<p>I know of other groups (Adobe forums comes to mind) where there are significant rebellions against heavy handed moderators. We don&rsquo;t need that here.</p>

<p>We tend to use the title &ldquo;moderator&rdquo; to mean someone who intervenes only when things get out of hand, and by that I mean name calling, spam, and intellectual property disputes that are actual disputes (and not trolling).

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Joe said, “Anybody got a microscope?”</p>
<p>I hadn’t read your review of the Under Consideration book, or the book for that matter. I must say that your review was thorough and interesting. I guess that you tend to put things under a microscope and your form of criticism is to pick the subject apart on every level looking toward perfection. We live in a Wabi-Sabi world though. The imperfections are what makes things interesting. I think most of your criticisms there were trivial and the things you pointed out weren’t exceptionally detrimental to the overall success of the project.</p>
<p>But back to the criticism that is the subject of this thread&hellip;</p>
<p>There seems to be a consensus that there needs to be more moderators in various time zones to eliminate spam. I’m sure Punchcut is welcoming to all qualified volunteers. You seem to feel though that there needs to be more moderators to direct the discussion — at least if I understand you correctly. From what I’ve seen the nature of this particular message board is that the users, who are all registered and a great community, do a fantastic job of moderating the discussions without the need of designated leaders. Although we still haven’t managed to keep Bowerbird from using those damned crazy and distracting line breaks.</p>
<p>I have seen the moderators working at the tasks they are needed to cover. Every time I see a pirate site linked, the link is killed by my next visit. And maybe I don&rsquo;t come with enough frequency, but I hardly ever see spam. While they may not be fulfilling the role that you expect, I think they fulfill the role that works for the majority of the visitors.</p>
<p>I’ll conclude my discussion on this thread by saying that we all play a part. After this exchange with you I have a better appreciation of your role. Although I do have to agree with what William Berkson said at the end of his comment, I concede that you are who you are and just being you. Maybe you are getting plenty of fiber, but there still seems to be a problem with anal retention. I can learn to dig it though (not literally of course). ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, I said I found Joe&rsquo;s review very funny. I enjoyed the writing. I&rsquo;ve no idea if it is a fair or accurate review of the book in question. If I were interested in graphic design, I would go look at the book and form my own opinions. I have no comment on the book, because I have not seen it; but the review made me laugh, especially the errata section.</p>
<p>I would say that it is important to be charitable in the interpretation of the <em>intentions</em> of others when those intentions are unknown or unclear; i.e., as you pointed out in the thread re. the NBC lawsuit, not to presume evil motive. Actions and things resulting from actions can be judged on their merits or faults, independent of intention, which is the nature of criticism. So Joe finds the book contemptible, and you find his review to be objectionable, and these are both instances of criticism. Criticism is messy, of course, because humans invest themselves in the things that they make, and we seldom actually discount intentions. Do we risk being uncharitable to Joe in ascribing lack of charity to his review.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, I don&rsquo;t think I am being uncharitable to Joe because regularly his posts on Typophile, including in this thread, are dripping with contempt, as is the review.</p>
<p>Insulting people in public, such as Joe does above, is considered in rabbinic ethics a serious sin, known as &lsquo;halbanat panim&rsquo;, literally &ldquo;causing a person to blanch.&rdquo; And also there is a commandment to rebuke and not participate in your neighbor&rsquo;s sin (Lev. 19:17), which is why I have called Joe on it.</p>
<p>You write as if Joe isn&rsquo;t ascribing bad motives to Vit and his wife, but that&rsquo;s exactly what the extensive first part of his review does. He says of the book &ldquo;Its purpose is clear even if the authors are evasive about it.&rdquo; I haven&rsquo;t read the book and don&rsquo;t know the authors' actual views, but from his just quoted statement neither does Joe&ndash;and he imputes to them views that he dislikes, and roundly condemns them. Jewish ethics&ndash;and as I understand from you Catholic ethics as well&ndash;would require Joe to at least suspend judgment about their motives.</p>
<p>Joe is very knowledgeable and at times amusing, but it doesn&rsquo;t excuse such disrespect and rudeness.</p>
<p>Just to take one example, he above is sarcastic about non-English speakers on Typophile, and takes Vit, whose first language is not English, to task for English mistakes. Personally I am very grateful for the contribution to Typophile of those whose second or third language is English, and also to Vit for his contributions to American design. We English speakers are very lucky that English has become the international language, and I appreciate the time others have put in to learn English so well.</p>
<p>If anyone should be taken to task it should be the publishers who didn&rsquo;t pay for proper editing, particularly to help an author who is not a native speaker.</p>

It&rsquo;s a small community and likely to stay that way. It&rsquo;s mostly civil. Very civil in fact, compared to some others I&rsquo;ve seen and been member of. There is nobody here yelling or swearing at anyone, and it tends to be self regulating enough not require continuous monitoring by moderators.</p>
<p>Spam? It comes and goes. It&rsquo;s obvious went you see it and easy to ignore in small doses, and the spam here comes in small doses I believe. The complaining about spam takes up much more space than the spam.</p>

J a m e s was attacking everyone willy nilly, someone else was writing at length about font forgeries and how typefaces cannot be copyrighted, and nobody seemed to mind. I wonder whether the petty crankiness of this forum is not one of its attractions.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>Joe is very knowledgeable and at times amusing, but it doesn’t excuse such disrespect and rudeness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joe sometimes comes off like a jerk, but don&rsquo;t let that fool you, he really is a jerk. He should be sent back to his father and brothers who are waiting for him with open arms in the penitentiary.
I say we give him ten years in Leavenworth or eleven years in Twelveworth. (Or maybe five and ten in Woolworth!)</p>
<p>Anyway, Joe isn&rsquo;t a person, exactly. He&rsquo;s an experience.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My opinion does not matter, but I see all this stemming from permitting anonymous posts. A possible solution: Allow anonymity only in Type ID board. No more requests for ID elsewhere, no more anonymous trolls elsewhere.</p>
<p>Anonymous emails are spam, and are treated with contempt by everyone. Why do we have anonymous postings? To allow whistleblowers to reveal some type conspiracy? Or to dob in someone for bad kerning? Anonymity is only useful for law enforcement or media, to gain information not available any other way. In a forum like this it only encourages spammers and trolls.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It is quite true that I have not ben able to sweep through the threads carefully for the last year, and my value as a moderator as been correspondingly less. I will likely improve in the next year because my year at Reading MATD has come to a close. But given the scale of new threads at typophile and the other demands on time the best resource moderators have is readers pointing out what they think is a problem. So please do!</div>
