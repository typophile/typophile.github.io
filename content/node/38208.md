  body: "Hello, \r\nArabic is written and read right to left. There are 2 types of
    Arabic calligraphy, one called \"Naskh\" which is individual characters, and one
    called \"Requa\" which is script calligraphy. However, all Arabic authentic lettering
    should have supporting shapes either on top or underneath in order to be read
    the right way. These shapes are like dashes, circles and some other shapes. Those
    shapes stand for the vocal grammatical pronunciation. Its quite a complex calligraphy
    especially the \"Requa\", and thats the one used in the Holy Quoran Book. \r\n\r\nI
    hope that was of help.\r\n \r\nhttp://vysionous.deviantart.com"

  body: "Are you looking for technical information on how to make an Arabic font?\r\n\r\nDespite
    its title, <em>Arabic Typography: A Comprehensive Sourcebook</em> is far from
    comprehensive, much of its technical discussion is very weak and actually derived
    from examples of Latin type, and there are inaccuracies and omissions. There isn't
    a single good source of information of Arabic typography. For technical information
    on Arabic OpenType fonts, this is the best place to start:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/arabic/intro.mspx\r\n\r\nIf
    you are interested in the Arabic script in general, as opposed to the technical
    stuff, there is a massive amount of material written about the scribal heritage
    (I don't use the term calligraphy, because that refers to a very specific kind
    of art-text, and misses the point that most of what scribes historically produced
    is everyday text.\r\n\r\n<em>There are 2 types of Arabic calligraphy, one called
    \u201CNaskh\u201D which is individual characters, and one called \u201CRequa\u201D
    which is script calligraphy ... Its quite a complex calligraphy especially the
    \u201CRequa\u201D, and thats the one used in the Holy Quoran Book</em>\r\n\r\nThis
    is a misleading statement in many ways. There are many more than two styles of
    Arabic script. Naskh (also called Nesih) is not 'individual characters': it the
    most common text hand used in formal manuscripts, including most Qur'ans (in Persian
    influenced areas, Qur'ans are also written in the nasta'liq style).\r\n\r\nMohamed
    Zakariya, the leading Islamic calligrapher in the USA, is developing what promises
    to be an excellent website devoted to the Arabic script. Unfortunately, his page
    on different styles is not yet illustrated:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zakariya.net/history/examples.html"
