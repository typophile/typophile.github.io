  not expensive book but I already have a book \"Designing type\" by Karen Cheng.
  \r\nIs it worth buing it?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"

  body: The book is described as a case study of Jonathan Barnbrook's Priori typeface.
    As such, it might be interesting, and may also offer some insights that might
    be applicable to designing other typefaces, but I suspect it should be considered
    how to design <em>a</em> -- one, particular -- typeface.

  body: "The title is quite deceptive; as John pointed out it is a case study in the
    design of one typeface. I would add that it is not an especially interesting case
    study. Unless you adore Barnbrook\u2019s work it is a waste of $15. Do yourself
    a favor and find a copy of Doyald Young\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/fonts-logos/oclc/43713945&referer=brief_results\">Fonts
    and Logos</a>."
