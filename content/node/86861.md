  (perhaps \"trend\" isnt really the word im looking for, but i hope you'll get the
  point;) regarding types 2012.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep it on a fairly graspable level,
  think of the usage as in ongoing head and/or body text (in other words - not fonts
  you think look nice once but not twice if you get my point).\r\n\r\nSo,  what (\"new/fresh\")
  fonts would you like to see more of the coming year?\r\n\r\nCheers!  "
