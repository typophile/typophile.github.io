body: "Hi there, everyone!\r\n\r\nIt's time for a little (self) promotion activity.
  I would like to introduce the new decorative display font <strong>Pilo</strong>,
  now available at <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000314\"
  target=\"_blank\">Veer</a>. It's based on the logotype of the swedish advertising
  community <a href=\"http://www.bold.se/\">bold.se</a> and I think that the negative
  kern makes it kind of unique. The Bold logotype is designed by Bj\xF6rn H\xF6glund
  at <a href=\"http://www.daddy.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Daddy</a>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pilo_4884.gif]\r\n\r\n-
  - - - -\r\n\r\n<strong>About this typeface:</strong>\r\nKenneth Pilo had never designed
  a typeface. This type of project was long overdue. In collaboration with M\xE5rten
  Fischer, Ray Larabie of Typodermic, and G\xF6ran S\xF6derstr\xF6m of Pangea Design,
  the font \u201CPilo\u201D was born in 2007. Pilo is a bold, single weight OpenType
  face featuring subtle inline detailing and a solid sporting aesthetic. It feels
  both hard and soft, decorative and stoic, vintage and modern.\r\n\r\n<strong>About
  the designer:</strong>\r\nKenneth Pilo is currently art director and creative director
  of <a href=\"http://www.pilo.se/\" target=\"_blank\">pilo.se</a>, his own virtual
  agency in Sweden. Since being offered employment at a design agency a week before
  ending his compulsory schooling, he has worked constantly in the advertising business
  for over 30 years. During that time, he has done it all ... campaigns, ads, packaging,
  promotions, commercials, web design, virals, events, television and radio show production,
  magazines, music ... and the list goes on. All for the love of design. For the past
  five years he has also been the driving force behind the online community <a href=\"http://www.bold.se/\">bold.se</a>
  - a meeting point for the Swedish advertising business.\r\n\r\n- - - - -\r\n\r\nI
  hope you'll like it!\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n/M\xE5rten Fischer"

    fonts as well as the trend for layered fonts why you didn't take this a step further?"

  body: "Well, James Puckett and everyone else. Now you can get the inline version
    of this typeface, <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000356\">Pilo
    Thin</a> via Veer. Kenneth Pilo puts it like this: \xBBThe mission of Pilo Thin
    was to create a typeface that was exactly the opposite of the very bold <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000314\">Pilo
    Regular</a>. A thinner cousin, which would create the contrast and to be a credible
    member of the family. The challenge was to make the font build as much as possible
    on inner lines in Pilo Regular but that it would feel like it just picked them
    off. Pilo Thin is more feminine and some shapes has been softened up and adjusted
    so that Pilo Thin can stand on it\u2019s own, but without forgetting its origin.\xAB\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pilo_Thin_Specimen_2008-09-02_4733.gif]"
