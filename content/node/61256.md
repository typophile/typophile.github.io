body: "\r\nI received a call for entries from a Chinese publisher this week for a
  book about type. Next to my bio, images of the typeface in use and so on they also
  ask for the font files, which makes me suspicious. Plus, the sender has a hotmail
  address, not from the publisher's domain.\r\n\r\nHas anyony else recieved this?
  Do you think it is trustworthy? Or, is someone trying to trick me into sending my
  fonts? I have no idea whether this is genuine."

    proposals like this one. Never send them actual font-files though. I would follow
    Stephen's suggestion."

  body: There's a fast-growing typesetting industry in China now, because US and European
    publishers often send books to China to be typeset. Most of these businesses are
    probably legit, but it would be prudent to consider the possibility that this
    "invitation" is really a shady typesetter trying to scam some free fonts.

  body: I got a similar request, not fonts but bio, images et al, last year for a
    book about typography. After sending some questions (nothing else) I never heard
    anything again. Try to reply asking for more deails, even if they answer I would
    rather go for the pdf/eps option.
