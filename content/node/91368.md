body: "I am designing a logo for a client, and between my sketches I was convinced
  to go for a style of this kind.\r\nThe point is that I wanted to look for some typographic
  font that looks similar and adapt vectorially, but I kind of fall in panic, not
  knowing what kind of font could be called this (script maybe?) and unable to narrow
  down the kind of font that I need.\r\n\r\nIt would be an F, and I noticed only afterwards
  the similarity with the old logo of the flash (which it isn't what exactly I want
  because it is to thick, and I want something more elegant and slim).\r\n\r\nSketch\r\n

    at the fonts he has made.\r\n\r\nThis might work out too:\r\nhttp://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=129\r\n(http://www.emigre.com/EFo.php?view=s)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "If I understood you correctly, you are basically looking for an <strong>italic</strong>
    f with descender. There are plenty of options. The one you sketched looks rather
    light and maybe from a low-contrast sans-serif family. Here is the f from Facit
    Italic, just as one reference:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/justanotherfoundry/facit/italic/glyphs/280414/71\r\nNote
    that most fonts also have a character called \u2018latin small letter f with hook\u2019,
    which can look similar, or even identical: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/justanotherfoundry/facit/italic/glyphs/280414/101\r\nIt
    was mainly used as a currency symbol for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_guilder\">Dutch
    guilder</a>."

    body: "Thank you to help with the terminology, yes I need a kind of extreme italiced
      F with a long descender.\r\nThat is quite similar with what I want... I'll try
      to look some more on google, and if I do not find anything I will probably modify
      the type in illustrator."

    body: "quite nice that one! mmm let me try how I can play with a serif and sans-serif
      one still not sure for the one I should go.\r\n\r\nAnyway thank you very much
      for you help!! are those little things that help me to discover more about types."
