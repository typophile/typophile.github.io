  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>hey everybody,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m designing a logo for &lsquo;perron 20&rsquo;. This is dutch for platform 20. They advise addicts about financial and social things by people who have been addicts themselves. &lsquo;Wij leven met je mee&rsquo; means something like &lsquo;We feel empathy for you&rsquo;. Keywords: professional, positive, open and warm. I used Livory by HVD fonts because it seems to radiate warmth and comfort. I like the look of it, but I think it needs an icon to symbolize what they do. Any commends are welcome! I&rsquo;ve thought about something with a train or platform for an icon, but that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>Jasper de Waard</p>

<p>Orange is a nice choice, too. But Orozco&rsquo;s idea is quite smart and could make a good case with the client. I don&rsquo;t mind the circle, but it certainly isn&rsquo;t doing much for balance.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue that <i>most people</i> in Holland aren&rsquo;t your audience. Recovering addicts in Holland are your audience, and they are also your clients. I don&rsquo;t know anything about addiction treatment in Holland, but in Germany there&rsquo;s even a song by an artist called Blossom (Blümchen), &ldquo;Pink Cloud&rdquo; (&ldquo;Rosa Wolke,&rdquo; a bad little techno number, but the lyrics seem pretty clearly about the addiction recovery denial phenomenon to me, in either tongue).</p>
<p>You seem to know what you want, and I applaud that, but I&rsquo;d still tell you the same. Livory is a handsome oldstyle face. But the invitation it sends to me is one from authority, rather than from a peer. Just things to consider. There are messages in our fonts&hellip;!</p>
<p>Good luck with the client!</p>

Yes, I agree. I&rsquo;ve been looking at this a few times and while it does look nice, the «tone» seems slightly off for the audience and situation you&rsquo;re communicating in. Consider that communication doesn&rsquo;t only involve <em>what</em> is being said and <em>how</em> the tone/voice feels to yourself, but there&rsquo;s also the question of <em>who</em> is speaking to <em>whom</em> (and how those people are made to feel). In the situation you describe, I&rsquo;d also expect something that communicates more from peer to peer. Livory is beautiful, but it does evoke the old age of book wisdom, a printed æsthetic, where knowledge – and help – was a much more hierarchical and authoritarian affair. This tone of «authority» is one you would exactly want to avoid, I guess – it might feel ever so slightly patronizing (I&rsquo;m assuming your target audience might be very sensitive to how their situation is presented or referred to). You need something that communicates at eye level; something that&rsquo;s fresher and straighter without being cold, something honest and strong, not this artistic/«bookish» and soft. Warmth is good, but not condescending warmth – warmth at eye level.</p>
<p>On a more «surface» level, one thing that makes me find Livory a wrong choice in this context is that if you look at the actual shapes of the characters, it seems sad rather than strong. There are a lot of «frowning» shapes. The top-left instrokes of the &ldquo;p&rdquo;, &ldquo;n&rdquo;, and &ldquo;r&rdquo; all droop down. The opening of the &ldquo;p&rdquo; also makes it look sad to me. The overall softness (which looks eroded, like something was washed away) says everything <em>but</em> freshness, strength, youth, and being able to rebound from something that&rsquo;s as hard to overcome as addiction.</p>
<p>In case I sound harsh: I like the font too, but I&rsquo;m trying to look past my own taste and think into what it needs to communicate in this case, and I think it&rsquo;s miscast, like a good actor in the wrong role.</p>
<p>BTW, what&rsquo;s with the railway metaphor? Is that important to the client, should it be played off? (You don&rsquo;t need to draw a train icon, but maybe use a font that could be used in railway signage or something?)</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to go back to the drawing board. It&rsquo;s quite a complicated organisation to sum up in a logo. For this reason I think your interpretation of warmth and approachability is appropriate. Now you must choose how to communicate these ideas. Beyond emotive choices it is a graphic exercise, weight, proportion, relationship, essentially creating a kind of neatness or harmony.</p>
<p>Consider the regular demands of a logo; must work at different scales, possibly in black only.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it is a common misconception that a logo must sum up an organisation entirely, or communicate a literal summary, I certainly fall into this trap myself.
