Not so. From what I gather, It was often used in inscriptions. But mostly at the end of words and essentially just in order to save space.
Incidentally, the samples I was able to find were of the "backslanted E" type.

Latin inscriptions often contained not just Æ but other space-saving ligatures. So Æ was essentially just a graphic variant of AE and not accorded special status in Classical Latin. But then the diphthong represented by the digraph AE began to be pronounced as a single sound in Later Latin, eventually merging with E, and the ligature Æ became a useful shorthand for this.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Want a kind of logical answer? 

If in the lower case, the e is dominant over the a (what I mean is, it retains its shape at the expense of the a whose tail is markedly affected by the e) then shouldn't the E similarly dominate the A (as it does in the vast majority of AEs) and thus the backbone of the E will be vertical?

I personally prefer this dominant E and don't warm at all to the slanted E but I guess you didn't ask about either preference or logic.

Bliss and Myriad use slightly slanted backbone to E. I guess If you're going for equal rights then you've got to slant it a little. 

It was almost certainly you (or maybe Chris L) who once said to me, "whatever looks best is the right answer." Would this be any different?</div>

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AEOE_5351.gif]
1. E is the dominant element. This seems to be the most common solution by far.
2. Both elements are equally dominant. I don't really recall seeing this type of solution, even though it doesn't look entirely displeasing to the eye.
3. The A or O is the dominant element. Rarer than 1. but does occur.
4. The elements retain their own shapes and are joined at a point. Much more common to see the Œ designed this way than the Æ.
5. Erm, yeah. Overlapping elements. Train wreck for the Æ, but for certain typefaces the Œ is designed this way.

Interestingly, the Æ is likely to take form 1. even if the Œ takes other forms.</div>

In ecclesiastical Latin one encounters words of Hebrew origin, usually names, in which <em>ae</em> may be pronounced as separate vowels. In this case, though, the variant pronunciation is typically indicated by a diaeresis, e.g. <em>Sancte Michaël Archangeli.<em></div>

Yes, there are some loanwords and proper nouns, like Aetius, where "ae" represents two separate sounds rather than a diphthong. In Roman inscriptions, though, whether it is a diphthong has nothing to do with whether it is ligatured. Any pair (or occasionally more) of letters in any word can be ligatured, if it makes sense graphically. It's purely a design/layout decision.

		<div class="commentbody">The problem with Æ no. 2 is the angle of the stem. Since it's neither vertical nor really diagonal, it makes the glyph look left-leaning ("linkskursiv" or "rückwärts liegend" in German, I don't know the English term, if there is one). My choices are definitely Æ no. 1 and Œ no. 3, but for a sans serif I might chose Œ no. 1. Œ no. 4 is pleasing to the eye, but I feel it's not ligated enough. Œ no. 5 looks very Mannerist or Baroque, and might work in such a typeface.  

Just as I think the E is the important part of the Æ ligature, I think the O bit is most important for the Œ. I'm of course heavily culturally biased. The Œ is not used in modern Norwegian, but it's traditionally used for normalised transcription of the long Ø-sound in Old Norse. (These days, it's sadly being replaced by the (mostly) inaccessible and ugly Ø acute. Curse modern scholars!)

		<div class="commentbody">I almost always go for a solution like on the left of the initial post - but this is just my personal preference. This also has has the added benefit of the left side kerning like an A and the right side kerning like an E for the class kerning :)
I also prefer the Æ to be narrower than its two parts - so shortening the E bars and closing up the counters of the A bit is par for the course.

But be aware that this Æ form is sort of constructed. In written form the Æ is written in just three strokes:
- the A angle and lower bar of E in one stroke: /\_
- the crossbar of the A and E in one stroke: --
- the top bar of the E starting at the apex of the A:-
So the right solution of the initial post is closer to a written form.

@ Nick Shinn: yes, the crossbars should ideally be aligned - but this is usually difficult to achieve in bolder weights (the A counter becomes too small very fast ;)

There are many horribly designed "Æ"s out there, so be careful what you use for reference...</div>

That's what I thought.
I put a "Latin dipthong" feature in Paradigm Pro as a Stylistic Set, including "titlecase" glyphs.
Bit of a gimmick, and I really wanted to include roman numeralization too, but never got around to figuring out the code (although it was published here recently).

		<div class="commentbody">Seeing Michael's example reminded me vaguely of [[http://kltf.de/kltf_grotext.htm|KLTF Grotext]]. It has AE, OE, and UE (!) ligatures. In addition to the usual capital ligatures, there are glyphs where the first component is a capital and the E is in small caps. There are also Ae, Oe, and Ue ligatures where the second component is in lowercase form. 

My guess is that these were conceived as experimental alternate forms of the German umlauted vowels (hence the UE ligature for Ü). These forms are certainly not what readers would expect for languages whose orthographies actually use æ or œ.</div>

I don't think that's the case with œ in French.
In Canada, one is quite used to seeing œ spelled oeuf.
For instance:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/32_4085.jpg]
I don't know if it's the same in France.

At any rate, designers don't seem to mind splitting the diphthong, for various reasons:

<cite>At any rate, designers don't seem to mind splitting the diphthong, for various reasons:</cite>

In France, too, œ is very frequently spelled oe, even though it is not strictly correct, in large part because it can't be typed with the standard French keyboard. I was talking about the actual ligature for text faces; when people go through the trouble of using the actual ligature rather than Oe, they would use the form Œ.

It is such a rare occurrence for Œ to come at the beginning of a word where only the first letter would be capitalized that I guess you can't really talk with much certainty about what readers would expect. In fact, I have to say the Oe ligature reads very naturally. I think French readers may think of œ as something like just tightly kerned oe, so the Oe ligature makes sense in that way. This would not be the case with, say, Norwegians and æ.

Here's another example I found, presumably from France (unless it's just a coincidence through bad spacing).

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Affiche_Oedipe_Roi_5362.jpg]

(Note that this is an exception. Most settings of Œdipe that I found through an image search use the standard form of the ligature or spell it Oedipe.)</div>
