  body: 'This is a very interesting topic indeed, with many facets to it. <BR>I think
    the key is to be both pragmatic and honest. <BR> <BR>You can&#39;t know if somebody
    has already made what you&#39;re making &#40;although asking on Typophile is a
    pretty solid method of finding out&#41;. But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s worth
    going on with your design or not! As long as you don&#39;t consciously copy somebody
    without credit, you&#39;re morally safe. But that doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t
    be a waste of time! On the other hand, the action of making something yourself
    has its own rewards. <BR> <BR>For smaller sizes, chances are in fact that something
    95% similar has already been done. Does it matter if it was done before? Not really.
    As long as you don&#39;t pretend yours was earlier. <BR> <BR>Larger sizes: I don&#39;t
    think that&#39;s significant &#40;because WYSIWYG is illusionary anyway&#41;,
    except maybe if the other font also has a large size &#40;that&#39;s different
    than yours&#41; - but even then it might be moot. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a real cruncher:
    Should you consciously AVOID finding out if your design has already been done?!
    Maybe yes. Because if you start something then find something extant that&#39;s
    very similar you will be tempted &#40;if you&#39;re an honest person&#41; to intentionally
    make yours different in some hoaky way! :-/ And that&#39;s bad design. <BR> <BR>If
    you&#39;re sincerely worried, you might consider going with grayscale pixelfont
    design, where the chances for conflict are much less. <BR> <BR>So in some ways
    it&#39;s good not to pay too much attention to what others are doing. Personally
    for me this is a tug-of war: I relish knowing what&#39;s out there, but I&#39;m
    also too full of myself to draw too much inspiration from what I do see! I can
    be very negative and over-confident, always seeing ways that I can do something
    so much better, often in a totally different way. But in practice I hit many of
    the same obstacles everybody else does. I think that&#39;s OK because my constant
    critique of what I see keeps people &#40;including me&#41; always on their toes
    and looking ahead. <BR> <BR>In the case of my Mana &#40;a grayscale font&#41;,
    I started the 16-pixel version 6 years ago, and now that it&#39;s released I don&#39;t
    see anything similar &#40;and it&#39;s hard to imagine something similar that&#39;s
    not consciously copied&#41;. But I&#39;ve been working on the 13 for about 2 years
    now, and recently I realized it&#39;s somewhat close to Arial &#40;at 13 PPEM&#41;!
    Does it matter? Morally, no, because I didn&#39;t look at Arial when I was making
    it - I made it by carrying over as much of the essence of the 16 that I could,
    without violating the essence of the 13 pixel constraint, so to speak. But it
    would very much matter practically, because nobody would buy it... except that
    it&#39;s grayscale! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I don&#39;t really pay a lot of attention to other stuff so I think I&#39;m
    &#34;clean&#34; on that matter. =&#41; <BR> <BR>I really meant to create it as
    a total improvisation, something small that I can do quickly just to get the basics
    down for creating pixel fonts. Then I&#39;ll move to something more complicated.
    <BR> <BR>Can you develop on the grayscale topic? By this, do you mean creating
    some kind of anti-aliasing? I can really see how this would open possibilities
    to make something different, even if small.

  body: Grayscale bitmaps are simply&#42; bitmap fonts that use shades of gray instead
    of just black and white, the point being that a careful&#42;&#42; application
    of gray pixels can deliver greater fidelity and readability &#40;while being careful
    not to introduce too much fuzz&#41;. On the surface you can just &#34;paint&#34;
    your grayscale fonts in something like Photoshop, but when it comes to deliver
    them as robust fonts, you don&#39;t have the same luxury as with 1-bit fonts in
    terms of delivering them as &#34;true&#34; bitmap fonts &#40;for example by embedding
    them in TT fonts for Windows&#41;, you have to make pixelfonts &#40;like you&#39;re
    doing anyway&#41;. The difference is that pixelfonts are outline fonts, but ones
    that only &#34;click&#34; for one point size. The tricky thing with grayscale
    pixelfonts is that the way you place <i>partial</i> pixels is technically challenging,
    in terms of ensuring correct rendering in both platforms and various apps. The
    other negative is that they look lousy when set large &#40;unlike 1-bit pixelfonts,
    which can look cute, if not very versatile&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; Actually, the
    availability of gray makes the creation of such fonts a very different exercise
    - so the difference really isn&#39;t &#34;simple&#34; at all. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;
    Careful being what automatic-from-outline rendering algorithms are NOT. That&#39;s
    why it needs to be done by hand &#40;for sizes below about 22 pixels&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>You can look at <a href="http://www.ultrafonts.com" target="_blank">http://www.ultrafonts.com</a>
    to see grayscale pixelfonts in action. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hrant, thanks for the info! <BR>I think I&#39;ll start without the gray pixels
    ;&#41; <BR> <BR>What about the kerning of pixel fonts? <BR>I&#39;ve done it in
    fontographer before using standard outlines. Next time I&#39;m planning to switch
    to FontLab. <BR> <BR>Do you need to do your kerning in pixels as well so that
    it will snap? Also, do you know if it&#39;s possible to have some glyphs overlapping
    on each other? &#40;example, a long &#34;tail&#34; on the Q like in Baskerville.&#41;
    God, I need to learn these english typographic terms =&#41;

  body: 'Kerning: yes, you can &#40;and should&#41; do kerning - and like you suspect
    it just has to be defined in &#34;whole units&#34;. For example if your Em is
    8 pixels high the kern values would be mutiples of 125 &#40;&#43;/-&#41;. In practice,
    few people kern pixelfonts though. <BR> <BR>Overlapping: In a &#34;true&#34; bitmap
    font you might have trouble defining pixels outside of the bounding-box &#40;I
    think it depends on the format&#41;, but in a pixelfont it&#39;s not an issue,
    since it&#39;s basically an outline font. But you don&#39;t often have to do it;
    in Mana-16 for example only the Florin and Ordfeminine do it - although the cap
    accents do extend over the top of the Em. <BR> <BR>BTW, the old metal term for
    &#34;overlapping&#34; - or actually just a part of a letter projecting beyond
    its sidebearings- was &#34;kern&#34;! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
