<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi everyone, <br> <br>I've decided to take advantage of the Critique Forum to test-drive some of <br>my designs. First up are the front and back covers of a catalogue. Here goes <br>nothing: <br> <br>:catalogue <br><b>Decosit 2003</b> - International Trade Fair for upholstery fabrics <br>25th edition} <br><i>and</i> <br><b>DecoContract</b> - a worldwide view on contract interiors <br> <br>:concept <br>As the advertising campaign for Decosit (and its sister fair DecoContract) is <br>done by an advertising agency, I always have to work with the materials <br>they provide. Only the campaign pictures are mandatory. I choose to reuse <br>the colour scheme and usually take some liberties with the type treatment. <br> <br>This year's the 25th edition of the trade fair, so I decided to play around the <br>concept of Roman numerals XXV. I used this graphic theme both as micro- <br>treatment (textile pattern) and macro-treatment (container for the <br>DecoContract campaign image). <br> <br>The type family used in this year's campaign is Foundry Monoline (a radical <br>break away from Eurostile which they've been using for the past few years ;) ). <br>The XXV pattern looked interesting enough to me to try and design my own <br>characters based on the same simplified geometrical grid (my second ever <br>serious venture into type design). I did some minimal optical corrections, <br>but yes: that O and C are (based on) perfect circles, sorry about that. I <br>reckon the characters are small enough that it doesn't hinder. I also know I <br>could use <a href=http://www.shinntype.com/ target=_blank> Nick Shinn</a>'s <a href="http://www.fordesigners.com/products/fonts/view.cfm?CFID=378762&CFTOKEN=20620087&SKU=NS10100" target=_blank> Monkey</a>, but I'd rather do my own stuff. <br> <br>Let me know whaddayathink. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10613.jpg alt=Decosit2003></div>

<div class=commentbody>That looks good, Yves. <br>About the type: the "S" could be rotated clockwise a little, and the <br>counter of "A" is too small. <br>About the design: I like that the "XXV" patterns are the same on both <br>covers. But maybe the back one should be mirrored, so that it matches <br>the front cover when the catalogue is closed. I don't know... <br>The colors seems to be nice too. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I just realise that mirroring the back one you'll have "VXX" instead of <br>"XXV". But you can try mirroring the arrangement of the elements, <br>keeping the "XXV" un-mirrored.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'll try rotating the "S" as you suggest. The <br>problem with the "A" is that I did enlarge the <br>counter at some point, but then it started to look <br>like a triangle. :/ i'll give it another go and <br>post the results. <br> <br>I should have mentionned there are inside covers <br>coming up too. Actually, I was going to keep the <br>mirroring for the inside covers (while keeping the <br>"XXV" unmirrored) just like you suggested. How <br>does the saying go: "Great minds think alike"? ;)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think the S and A are good enough, Yves. And I like the inline <br>version a lot. <br> <br>About not having formal training in type design, I think that <br>shouldn't stop you in making your own typefaces. I don't have <br>formal education either, but I'm making my stuff here. <br>If you like it, just go ahead and have fun! :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Now that I look at the type on its own, you can <br>see very well I've been influenced by the work of <br>Neville Brody during my Art Academy days. ;) <br>The 'S', 'I' and 'M' are quite telling.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi everyone, <br> <br>I received feedback from the client. They asked for some adjustments: <br><ul><li>'2003' should be on front cover and make 'XXV' larger <li>Decocontract+ picture not in 'XXV' as it only exists for 3 years and this could be confusing</li></ul> <br>I decided to use the plus sign from DecoContract+ (the sister fair gets an expanded <br>treatment this year) as it emphasises both the + in the name and suggests the <br>pairing of both fairs. This time I added the inside covers too. Feel free to tell me what <br>you think. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11058.jpg alt=Decosit2003_coverfront.jpg> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11059.jpg alt=Decosit2003_coverback.jpg> <br> <br>Here are the PDFs <br> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>Decosit2003_cover1.pdf<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Decosit2003_cover1-11060.pdf target=_blank><b>Decosit2003_cover1.pdf</b></a> (1339.2 k)</td></tr></table></center> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>Decosit2003_cover2.pdf<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Decosit2003_cover2-11061.pdf target=_blank><b>Decosit2003_cover2.pdf</b></a> (21.9 k)</td></tr></table></center> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>Decosit2003_cover3.pdf<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Decosit2003_cover3-11062.pdf target=_blank><b>Decosit2003_cover3.pdf</b></a> (11.2 k)</td></tr></table></center> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>Decosit2003_cover4.pdf<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Decosit2003_cover4-11063.pdf target=_blank><b>Decosit2003_cover4.pdf</b></a> (13.1 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hmm... your attachments weren't working yesterday, but now <br>I can see it. Odd. <br> <br>Anyway, about typeface choice: I think Gill Sans (Kayo? I <br>can't remember the correct name right now) and Eurostile <br>don't fit with the design. <br> <br>And, on your backcover, I think you could remove that big <br>background "XXV". This element looks strange with the <br>mirroring on inside/outside, imho. Just remove that and I think <br>that would be ok. Or you might try working with the plus sign <br>on backcover too. <br> <br>Do you know how many pages this is going to have? And what <br>size is it? <br> <br>Another thing. Maybe you can try working with another color <br>on the backcover. It seems like back and front cover are <br>totally different pieces, even with the same little XXV pattern. <br>I'm not so sure about this myself, but you might wanna try <br>something.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>> about typeface choice: I think Gill Sans (Kayo? <br>I can't remember the correct name right now) and <br>Eurostile don't fit with the design.</i> <br> <br>I know, they're horrible, aren't they? Those are the <br>official "logos", not to be touched. I consider it already <br>a small victory I convinced them to feature them on <br>the inside cover: last year they forced me to use them <br>on the front cover. It looked absolutely dreadful! <br>Did you really think I would in my right mind use this <br>combination of typefaces? ;P <br> <br><i>Maybe you can try working with another color on <br>the backcover.</i> <br> <br>Color scheme is provided by the agency that did the <br>advertising campaign; it refers to the ads and <br>preliminary flyers. Everything else is in this gray/ <br>green/olive scheme. I'll think about what I can do, <br>also about the big 'XXV' on the back covers.</div>
