  and interesting.\r\nHere's my question:\r\nI'm working on an art catalog I was wondering
  wich kind of sans-serif font type could match with Trajan font.\r\nThe artist use
  trajan in his work and I would like to use it too in the book.\r\n\r\nLooking forward
  your suggestion\r\n\r\nKlaus"

  body: "How do you envision using the Trajan and the sans serif? Trajan is all caps,
    so I'm guessing it's not for body copy. Maybe you want the sans serif for the
    body copy?\r\n\r\nTake a look at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-scala-sans/\">Scala
    Sans</a> or <a href=\"http://www.lucasfonts.com/cgi-bin/loadframe/lucasfnt/thesans/sans-.html\">TheSans</a>
    to see if they're something like what you want, and also check out fonts like
    <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/56036/ambigue-family.html\">Ambigue</a> and
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/charlotte-sans/\">Charlotte Sans</a>."

    title page and maybe some headlines. \r\nYes the sans serif is for body copy.\r\n\r\nThanks

    about it today: http://blog.webink.com/new-fonts-added/adobe-new-webink-web-fonts/\r\n\r\nOf
    course, it's caps (and small caps) only, so may not meet your needs."

    depending on the weight you need.\r\n\r\nIn your position, I'd also take a close
    look at Quadraat sans.\r\n"

  body: Quadraat Sans is a nice option, I think the caps have classical (Trajan-like)
    proportions. I might use Absara Sans over that, though. It's got less of an attitude,
    and would let Trajan do it's monumental thing.

  body: If you are using Lapidaria you may want to either avoid the Medior, or showcase
    them. If used properly it can make a great effect. (as long as it is pertinent,
    anyway)

  body: "The lower case of all the types mentioned lacks the basic geometric construction
    of Trajan.\r\nOf course, unless one goes down the Futura path, a nod must be made
    to the brush which underlies the Roman lapidary method, but that\u2019s all.\r\nDwiggins\u2019s
    Metro strikes the right balance \u2014 its capitals are remarkably faithful to
    the Trajan forms, and its lower case is geometric with just a hint of chirographic
    ductus."

    nor uppercase.\r\n\r\nIf lowercase gets \u201Cconstructed\u201D, Futura or \u2013
    worse \u2013 Avant Garde is the Result. This path has never been overly promising.\r\n\r\nRoma
    is an interesting take, though I\u2019d rather put it in the *Incised* category
    rather than in the sans, just like Robert Slimbach\u2019s recent release.\r\nHowever,
    the R of Roma disturbs me, the lowercase of it is an enigma to me.\r\nB, E, R
    of Metro are not at all trajanesque to my eyes.\r\n\r\nAnother worthwhile recent
    sans is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tipo-pepel/trajana-sans/regular/glyphs.html|Trajana
    Sans]]. But for me, it\u2019s again the R which proves to be tricky."

    my view imposes an\r\narbitrary, hence dysfunctional, constraint. Note that just

  body: Huh. I think my own Hypatia Sans works pretty well with Trajan. This may be
    in part because I very deliberately used the Trajan proportions for the capitals.  http://www.thomasphinney.com/2010/05/hypatia-sans-typeface-shipping/
