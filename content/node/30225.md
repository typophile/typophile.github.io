  body: "Kyle,\r\n\r\nfirst impression: this is lovely - playful & silly yet very
    professional. Somewhat reminding me of the Marx Brothers (don't ask why...). \r\n\r\nThe
    2 face illustration is working nicely too (great color choices), but i would detach
    it from the type as i gets a little hectic. Maybe try placing it on top or to
    the left of the type. \r\nAnyway, well done!\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: "I like too, not sure I agree so much with Seb and the detachment idea. I
    do however don't care much for the transparency on the lighter orange fellow (Haph,
    I presume). Make him a solid color. Also, the black is a bit over-powering, perhaps
    a dark gray or darker orange, or even a complimentary blue? \r\n\r\nAll in all,
    very well done. "

  body: I like this a lot as well. The only thing I might suggest is either use gray
    or don't use gray. I would not use gray as the black really makes those oranges
    pop.

  body: I'm loving it but why is the little guy in 2 two colours. I mean his nose
    is half yellow, half orange. As Asvetic said make hima solid colour too like the
    other fellow. I think if he was solid yellow, it owuld be better. When I mean
    yellow, i mean the colour that's projecting onto big guy. I liek it tho and the
    type with the grey shadow works better for me. Up to you though.

    both logos, but I think that the second might be overkill at times. I'd like to
    see the first logo in black with the & in another color. If you do go with the
    second, I think that the others are right and the second face should be a solid
    to keep things simple."
