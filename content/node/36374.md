  body: I think this has <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/28237">appeared before</a>.
    It's a lot like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/type_o_tones/wilma_base/?sample_text=TOONICEFRWDS&sample_size=48">Wilma</a>
    which is based on a wood typeface called Railroad Gothic. But not <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/red_rooster/railroad_gothic/">this
    Railroad Gothic</a>.

  body: Yeah, that ID was somewhat unsolved. For example the 'R' on Wilma is round.
    But I found it close enough at the time. :)
