body: "I'm sure this question must've been asked at some point, but I can't get the
  site search to work. Or maybe this is just a dumb question that no one else would
  dare ask ...\r\n\r\nIs there a broadly supported way to specify figure style in
  a webfont via CSS? I'm specifically looking at Freight Sans at the moment and anticipating
  the client's irritation with text figures in price lines and other promotional uses.
  But a more global concern of mine is whether or not webfonts even address this need."

    their puberty on desktop!). For consistent results, you will need a different
    font file, in the same way you need one for small caps."

    from the foundry, you could serve an optimised version of it where necessary. '
