  type in a book project about 15c Flemish painting. Here's the thing: I would really
  like to use a type of explicitly Flemish origin, and that's proving harder to find
  than one might expect. \r\n\r\nThe closest I've gotten is TEFF's Bugundica. It's
  got just the character I want, but of course isn't Flemish. It's also a little more
  expensive than the budget of this project can support.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

    idea that the name referenced the French region of Burgundy, and being unaware
    that the Duke of Burgundy controlled Flanders in the 15th century. Actually reading
    TEFF's description of that type makes it clear that it's pretty much exactly what
    I want and I should just bite the bullet and pay for it.\r\nSo: nevermind."
