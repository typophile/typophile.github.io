body: "Dear Community,\r\n\r\nI'm designing a brochure for a Fair Trade coffee company
  and am looking for typeface suggestions. The tone of the design will lean towards
  open, airy, organic, slightly quirky... The audience may be relatively wide (packaged
  coffee buyers in North America) but a core group will be socially minded, activist,
  west coast Canadians. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your input.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRich"
