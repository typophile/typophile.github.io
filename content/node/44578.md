body: "In 1938 Frederic W. Goudy designed a text family for the University of California
  called University Old Style. It was redrawn and digitized in 1994 by Richard Beatty
  and is now the exclusive typeface for the University of California, Berkeley. Monotype
  released this font in 1956 under the name Californian and later Tony Stan designed
  the ITC version, Berkeley Oldstyle. The UC makes it available for free download
  (subject to their standard EULA) at\r\n\r\nLINK REMOVED\r\n\r\nOldstyle figures
  are default-loaded in some fonts, and many variables are available, including weights
  specific to signage.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UniversityOldstyle_5093.png]"

  body: "Did you read the EULA? \r\n\r\nI removed the link. Sorry to be a party pooper.\r\n\r\nThe
    EULA clearly states: \r\n\r\n<em>You may download the UC Berkeley IP only for
    official UC Berkeley campus use, or if such use is subject to a fully executed
    Trademark License Agreement, Sponsorship Agreement, or personal use subject to
    the terms of this License and where such use would not be commercial or infringe
    on the rights of others. You may not transmit the UC Berkeley IP to any party
    without express written permission by the Office of Marketing & Management of
    Trademarks (herein after \u201COMMT\u201D).</em>\r\n\r\nEven though it says \"personal
    use\" I think this is some sort of mistake and am going to check on this. Gray
    area is where everyone gets into trouble and I think it is best to err on the
    side of safe. "

    for personal use ... ? I mean, you can even find the download links from the Berkeley
    home page if you know where to look.\r\n\r\nJens"

  body: I'm happy to have them tell me I was wrong. In which case I will restore the
    link. The problem being that I've had people tell me they didn't mean for the
    personal use to go beyond certain areas. If they reply to my email telling me
    that it is for anyone's personal use then I'll restore the link.

    like this is an illegal/clandestine/'pirate' web site or anything.\r\n\r\nYour
    call, of course."

  body: Maybe I'm being over protective. :^} But until I hear word saying that link
    is for the public then I don't think it belongs here. Simple as that.
