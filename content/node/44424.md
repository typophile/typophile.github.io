    the designer used a known font for inspiration is up to you to decide. It is not

    for similar fonts? I'm looking for something with a similar 'f' and 'y'."

  body: 'I think it is a custom job that might be based on two or even three different
    fonts. After looking at it for a while it looks untidy. The "antasy" could have
    been copied from a 1930s to ''50s script but the "f" looks like something from
    a more modern handwriting font. I don''t think someone designing a carefully researched
    retro script font would combine that "f" & that "t". '
