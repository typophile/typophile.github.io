  I need quick help regarding to this. I need to buy font that is similar to STAG
  (http://www.christianschwartz.com/stag.shtml)... \r\n\r\nReason - STAG is very often
  used, so I need font similar to it, but rare...\r\n\r\nThx in advance\r\n\r\nMirko"

  body: "Can you be more specific about what you are looking for? What is it about
    Stag that you like? Certain letters? Very heavy weight? Wide range of weights?
    When you say \"rare\", how obscure do you want? (Search small foundries for these)\r\n\r\nOle
    Sch\xE4fer has done a number of slab families, such as [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/qugard-slab/|Qugard
    Slab]], but until I have some idea what you are looking for, it's hard to make
    recommendations.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "When I say rare, I mean that this type I'm looking for isn't used very offten
    in commercials and advertising in my country (Serbia). Now, I see that a few companies
    use STAG for adverts, so that's why I search for similar type, but not seen in
    our country...\r\n\r\nI am designing a poster for wall, some kind of history diagram,
    with pictogramms as basic of communication, and this type to go along... Their
    logo is build from GIRL type (http://www.limundo.com/), so I need type that would
    match GIRLS spike endings (I can't describe different what I mean)... I saw a
    post here, and someone mentioned GRUEBER from Dalton mag, and there I found FOCO
    and PLUME ADVERTISING that would go nice with GIRL from logo... So, I know that
    my post was boring so far, if you think anything that would go nicely with this,
    I would appreciate that...\r\n\r\nThanks anyway\r\nMirko"
