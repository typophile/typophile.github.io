  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Here at slow-to-upgrade corporation &#40;still using OS 9&#41; we are having discussions about our kerning options. We make an effort to improve the quality of fonts we use on large campaigns. In the past, we&#39;ve used Quark kerning tables, but we have moved to doing most of our kerning in Fontographer. <BR> <BR>For those who use Quark kerning tables, do you have a system for storing and upgrading these tables? Do you create kern tables before using a font or do you capture and upgrade the tables as the font gets used? Any tips or hints would be appreciated. <BR> <BR>For those who use Fontographer to kern, what kind of system do you use? Do you set a limit to how many kern pairs you&#39;ll allow? Any tips? <BR> <BR>And for the future, what are the odds that this kerning information will be useful and or translatable to OpenType fonts or to InDesign? <BR> <BR>Thanks for your input! <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you&#39;re going to edit a font in FOG to &#34;fix&#34; the kerning then you may as well do it properly - ditch the kerning, respace the font for your proposed usage, &#42;then&#42; kern the font. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d avoid using Quark kerning tables: they&#39;re only 200 units per em, are not easily imported to a font editor &#40;you&#39;re going to have to massage them to fit the em digitization of the font&#41; and of course they are non-portable between other apps. <BR> <BR>If the kerning is in the font then you shouldn&#39;t have any issues saving it out of a suitable editor as OpenType, and or using it as Type 1 or OpenType in InDesign.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Neo and Hrant, I definitely agree on re-spacing fonts! <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love it if folks would explain the sort of guidelines they use when they kern fonts.  <BR> <BR>Do you use Fontographer, FontLab, something else? <BR> <BR>Do you kern every character combination, including numbers, punctuation etc.? Is there a reason why you would and would not do that? <BR> <BR>How do you differentiate the kerned fonts from the original fonts? <BR> <BR>Hrant, you make a joke about pricing, but please explain further. Is it just too expensive and or time consuming to kern an entire font? <BR> <BR>Also, since there have got to be other nutcases .... er, I mean &#34;artists&#34; ... out there who kern the heck out of their fonts, is there any effort  to share this information with one another? Would that be ethical? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m very curious to hear your responses. <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">1&#41; Although I tend to place more value on &#34;deep&#34; kerning than most people, I do agree with the conventional feeling that base spacing is very important. Not just for users sans access to the font&#39;s kerning value &#40;due to SW&#41;, but also because it makes kerning easier. Many fonts needs re-spacing more than re-kerning. <BR>2&#41; Kerning everything is not done because it&#39;s not worth it, and it bogs down the OS font engine. I use two kinds of data: linguistically frequent pairs &#40;and words&#41;, and rare but highly problematic pairs. Spacing/kerning is actually a very pragmatic process, even though it&#39;s really mostly technical. <BR>3&#41; Differentiation: A good method is to use a name that starts with 3 or 4 of the same letters as the original, preferably alphabetically right afterwards. <BR>4&#41; Sharing: some people would call it &#34;unprofessional&#34;, but to me <i>not</i> sharing &#40;at least to a reasonable extent&#41; is unethical. <BR> <BR>Pricing: no joke! I can do the job, for a reasonable fee. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Something else. <BR> <BR>First I space it! Then I kern based on test texts etc. <BR> <BR>Obviously don&#39;t kern numbers if you want aligning figures. Kern what you need to suit what you&#39;re doing, don&#39;t over kern it looks awful. <BR> <BR>Different names: &#34;KD Helvetica Headline&#34; <BR> <BR>Unethical, probably against the licencing, potentially fairly dangerous &#40;fonts floating around with different names, what do they do, is there some conflict in PS names, have references to the original been lost... if you&#39;ve done something like this then you can take responsibility for it, but other&#39;s may not really understand the process and consequences&#41;.</div>
