  paper to print my portfolio on.. price doesn't matter i'm willing to pay since this
  will be what i show to potential employers int he next 6 months and also in my portfolio

  so it goes with my whole brand (me) and my website/business card etc etc.. be nice

  body: "One thing I have to add is that jewel cases are not the least bit classy
    when it comes to having your portfolio on it. I believe in Arthur Miller's The
    Crucible, Reverend Hale proclaims \"Design, sir, is a fortress; no crack in a
    fortress may be accounted small.\"\r\nJewel cases crack easily and very difficult
    to express yourself artistically. Instead I suggest using InDesign's CD case template
    and spending the time to make something of your own design. Then just print that
    out on matte paper and rubber cement it together. CD cover stickers are a bonus."
