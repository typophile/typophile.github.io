  kind that highlights specific details of a typeface which clearly identifies it.
  Such as... the leg of the capital R helps to identify Gill Sans, or whatever. \r\nI
  feel like I'm slowly getting better at doing this, but a guide would great to have.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nbrian"

  body: The Bauhaus guide on this site just helped me find a font I haven't been able
    to identify for a week. One the other hand, I honestly cannot figure out how to
    use the sans id table guide. I've read through the instructions several times,
    but it won't penetrate my brain.

    resource to have.\r\nI'm pretty surprised that something like I described doesn't
    exist, it would be be quite helpful and an excellent teaching aid as well.\r\n"

  body: "My site is back up. Here is the interactive beta version of the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php|Sans
    Serif ID Guide]]. \r\n\r\nIt has been brought up to date through the most recent
    FontShop FontBook (2006), but relatively few updates since then. Images are still
    missing for many of the newer fonts, and designer information is still missing
    in many cases. Jan has generously volunteered to help bring it up to date, and
    eventually it will replace the static Sans Guide now on my site.\r\n\r\n - Mike

  body: "BTW Brian, the old book \"Rookledge's International Typefinder\" has a diagnostic
    visual key scheme to use attributes of letters to identify typefaces with those
    features. It's excellent, but it was published in 1983, so the typefaces are truly
    'classic', and many have not made it into digital form. The collection of Serif
    fonts in my edition reaches 240 typefaces. I think these is a later edition of
    the book, but still with fewer than 300 serif families shown. There are only 50
    Sans Serif families in the next section of the book, although more are found under
    Display headings.\r\n\r\nIdentifont does try to use a similar scheme allowing
    you to select attributes for a subset of letters, but I have found it very unreliable
    about using the information you give it, as if some of the algorithm code is messed
    up. Many times the selections are not even close to your choices.\r\n\r\nMy Serif
    and Sans Guides use a limited set of Key letters for you to select structural
    attributes, and tries to show you all the catalogued fonts that have those attributes
    for the letters you specified. You use the visual comparisons to pick the right
    font from the choices shown.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
