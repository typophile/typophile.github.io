  incomplete.\r\n[[http://www.heptasarim.com]]\r\n\r\nIn index, below menus part,
  i have presentation area that done in Flash. \r\n\r\nNow, i have to design a few
  banner/presentation/advert image. So, to use true fonts are very important. For
  days i am searching tutorial about this subject and finally i've found here. In
  this way i made a decision to ask to you.\r\n\r\n\u0130f you analyze that presentation
  area, you will see other image. But in new images i want to use font/typography
  much more.\r\n\r\nWhat do you say ? What should i do ? How must i use a font and
  design planning ?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.heptasarim.com]]\r\n"

    you need.\r\n\r\nYou could perhaps use @fontface to choose a replacement for Arial,
    e.g. a sans which has a lighter weight.\r\n\r\nYou like to work with type by colouring
    and over-laying -- nothing wrong with that (and your site has great colour and
    movement) -- but don't overdo it: try to make the content of your site the star,
    not over-elaborate typography and design. "
