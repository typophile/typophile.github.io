  it, and now I'm trying to design my personal cover for it.\r\nThe illustration is
  not 100% finished; but what I'm most worried about right now is the type... so if
  you'd take the time and help me choose the most appropriate type treatment, that
  would be great. :)\r\nOf course, beside just choosing a design, I'll be also happy
  to hear some new suggestions as well as overall critique of the cover!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ROAD_01_6452.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ROAD_02_5790.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ROAD_03_6480.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ROAD_04_4357.jpg]\r\n"

  body: "Hahah... maybe. :)\r\nBut here's a new, less-orangy version. ;)\r\nI'm a
    little worried about the \"Jack Kerouac\" type on the bottom. Not really sure
    it fits the rest. Any suggestions about that?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ROAD_new-2_6585.jpg]"

  body: I like the car hood. I like the white line in the road and the white letters
    for On The Road. I like the edgy tilted horizon. The author's name looks okay,
    but for an alternate look you could go with Jack Kerouac in a sans serif font
    (first and last name treated the same) along the lower edge of the book cover.
    Can you put some of that red from the hood into the sky to increase the contrast
    with the white letters? I am not sure specifically how. Maybe emanating from the
    sun (or is that the moon?) or in some other way. A gray sky does not seem right
    for this book.

  body: "Definitely prefer the sharply angled text for the title. What I find uncomfortable
    about the Author's name is the way it touches the bottom of the page - makes me
    want to pull it up a bit. I liked the orange but I don't know the book or the
    author  - and you've probably finished this one by now anyway!\r\n\r\nTanya"
