  although I couldn't find any reference to it. \r\n\r\nIn Quark for copyfitting I
  used to track out to a maximum of 2 (or sometimes 2.5, don't tell ;) ) and track
  in to a maximum of -2 but in indesign it seems to be different. My feeling is that
  -10 in indesign is the equivalent of -1 in Quark and -20 of -2. Is that correct
  or am I crazy? Certainly these values seem to have a similar effect.\r\n\r\nI would
  appreciate any help"

    but that is wrong. Quark uses 200 units, Indesign 1000. Quark's 1 unit track is
    therefore 5 units in Indesign (and Illustrator, for that matter). In other words:
    \u201310 in Indesign would be \u20132 in Quark."
