body: Some of you may notice a new link on the right hand side on the site, under
  your user name. While we're patching the disconnected pipes in Typophile's search
  engine, we're providing the "Search Typophile", which <strong>actually works.</strong>

    the other pangram threads ... \r\n\r\nit produced this pangram: Boxer M. Tyson
    packs his bags with Jay-Z DVDs, Quik, Holyfield\u2019s ear.\r\n\r\nwhich Paul
    added to the wiki.\r\n\r\nbut can't find it with the search.\r\n\r\nis there a
    text file of those somewhere ... or any idea how we could find that thread.\r\n\r\nnot
    a big deal at all; just more of an itch unscratched. :)\r\n\r\n"

    I can find.\r\n\r\n@eliason: Yes, we expect that advanced search will allow more
    specificity. However this will likely be part of a bigger Typophile update, which
    we're simultaneously working to finalize."

    removed the redundant text link on right. \r\n\r\nSearch results are relevant
    but still pretty raw; we'll continue to look at what enhancements we can bring
    in the next big update.\r\n\r\nYou can always search Typophile at http://typophile.com/search/,
    or search remotely by passing a text string to \"http://typophile.com/search/?keys={your
    text here}\"\r\n\r\nSpread the word!\r\n\r\n//jared\r\n"

  body: I get more results from the typophile.com/search page than from searching
    in the box at the top of this page. For example, "pangram" yields no results from
    the box up top.
