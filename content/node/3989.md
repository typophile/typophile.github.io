  body: H&amp;J is a broad topic, with plenty of room for debate. <BR> <BR>Nevertheless,
    here is a set of basic settings that I give to the designers I work with as a
    starting point. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/legacy/messages/30/32190.gif"
    alt="Standard H&amp;Js"> <BR> <BR>Make sure that in your Document Preferences
    &#62; Character tab, the box for Standard Em Space is checked. &#40;If you make
    these setting changes while no document is open, then these will become your default
    settings.&#41; <BR> <BR>These make for a decent starting point. I&#39;m sure others
    will have different defaults from which they start. Whatever you do, <b>don&#39;t
    use Quark&#39;s defaults</b>. <BR> <BR>The J settings will vary depending upon
    the line measure, the leading, the typeface, and personal tolerances &#40;or preferences&#41;
    for tightness vs. looseness. <BR> <BR>For instance, with a longer measure and
    more leading, I may allow word spacing to be looser Max. And depending upon the
    fit of the typeface, I may allow character spacing of &#43;1%. Conversely, with
    a shorter line, I may prefer a tighter Min. space. Also, with fonts that have
    an excessive word space built in, I may have to change all of the percentages
    accordingly. <BR> <BR>The H settings may vary depending upon editorial standards
    and line measure. For instance, in narrower columns, I prefer to set Min Before
    to 2 and allow Caps to break and unlimited hyphens in a row. These looser parameters
    will allow Quark more options to try to achieve more even spacing. I then manually
    override any unacceptable breaks. However, some editors will not allow a 2-letter
    break before under any circumstances. <BR> <BR>Regarding squooshing/stretching,
    I say Just Don&#39;t Do It. Same with tracking letterspacing. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: 'Yves, I used to be a purist and set Character Spacing to 0/0/0. But I found
    through some experimenting that I actually couldn&#39;t always notice the difference
    in -1% &#40;after putting it down and picking it up later, that is&#41;. So I
    started allowing it, just to give Quark a little more leeway to find a better
    line. But it does depend upon the typeface. <BR> <BR>Regarding Cap breaks, it&#39;s
    just a difference in approach. I let the machine try it and I reject it if I don&#39;t
    like it, instead of trying to find places where breaking caps will help. The thing
    is, I&#39;m usually going over everything anyway, so I let the program take a
    crack at it first. It depends a lot upon the content. In an Acknowledgement or
    something with a lot of names, I turn it off because it&#39;s a hassle to track
    them all down. And in medium to long measures, it&#39;s usually unnecessary. But
    in narrow columns, breaking Caps is one of those sacrifices I often consider.
    <BR> <BR>Nick, I won&#39;t ever scale a line. But I will use additional manual
    tracking on occasion to fix problems -- depends upon the typeface and measure.
    But I tell designers working under me not to do it, as a rule, until I can teach
    them by example, and over time, what&#39;s acceptable and what&#39;s not. <BR>
    <BR>Before resorting to tracking, though, I will usually try tracking just the
    word spacing. It&#39;s a useful trick, and more like traditional, metal typesetting.
    In Quark, if you have the TypeTricks XTension loaded, then highlight the line
    and using the following keyboard commands: <BR> <BR>Shift-command-option-control-[
    will reduce word space by 1 unit; <BR>Shift-command-control-[ will reduce word
    space by 10 units. <BR> <BR>A line will rarely tolerate more than -10 if my H&amp;Js
    are set well. The same combinations with the right bracket will increase word
    spacing accordingly. Note that these key combinations are similar to the ones
    for applying tracking, with the addition of the Control key. <BR> <BR>On my current
    projects, though, I have the good fortune to have a really good relationship with
    the editors and can usually get a rewrite &#40;or an okay on &#42;my&#42; rewrite&#41;.

  body: I don&#39;t agree with Erik&#39;s guidelines. I do agree that Quark&#39;s
    defaults often yield too tight letter spacing and too loose word spaces. But I
    think Erik&#39;s guidelines overcompensate.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think 80% word
    space in unjustified is always a good idea. It really depends upon the space and
    fitting of the typeface. For some, maybe; but not as a general rule in my book.
    <BR> <BR>I would especially &#42;not&#42; combine &#43;2 units tracking with 80%
    word space. Again depending upon the typeface, the individual words generally
    start to pull apart and the word space between them starts to close up and approach
    the size of the intercharacter spacing. You&#39;ll get a more even gray texture
    on the page this way, but I don&#39;t think this is necessarily good for the readability.
    For instance, I think that the text of <i>Stop Stealing Sheep</i> is a bit too
    loose in this way. &#40;I&#39;m looking at the first edition.&#41; Perhaps he
    gets away with it in this case because the style of writing is short and bite-sized,
    but I wouldn&#39;t want to read a novel or lengthy essay set like this. <BR> <BR>I
    agree that with smaller sizes, positive tracking is a good idea, just as it is
    a good general rule to use tighter tracking in display sizes. But my threshold
    for opening up the character spacing is usually down around 8 or 9 point, not
    Erik&#39;s 12. Again, it depends upon the typeface. Most reading faces are designed
    and fitted for use around 12 point. As a general rule for the average graphic
    designer, I would not recommend varying from the designed fitting until you get
    down into the smaller extremes. <BR> <BR>As far as that unlimited hyphen thing
    goes -- I have found that even when I allow Quark to use unlimited hyphens, it
    rarely provides more than three in a row anyway. Sometimes, four hyphens is the
    only way to achieve acceptable spacing in the paragraph.  <BR> <BR>Again, I let
    the program have some leeway to find what it thinks is the best solution, knowing
    that I will take the time to review everything anyway and can reject those that
    are not necessary or not acceptable.  <BR> <BR>I personally don&#39;t think hyphenation
    is the worst compromise in justified text, but it requires human judgement to
    determine when a hyphenation is cumbersome and impedes the sense of the text and
    when it is perfectly natural with the phrasing and cadence.  <BR> <BR>But there&#39;s
    nothing more frustrating than trying to tweak a paragraph by forcing a hyphen
    and not being able to figure out why it isn&#39;t allowing me to adjust it ...
    until I finally realize that there are already three hyphens and Quark is blindly
    obeying the three hyphen rule. After all, that&#39;s what machines do.  <BR> <BR>--

    been immersing myself in for the last month or two. I&#39;m about half way through
    James Felici&#39;s <i>The Complete Manual of Typography</i>, and have just started
    rereading Bringhurst&#39;s <i>Elements</i> &#40;which is even better now than
    4 years ago&#41;. <BR> <BR>Felici suggests &#40;with many examples&#41;, that
    flexing character spacing with care and respect, along with consideration for
    how much the word spacing is flexing, is fine and even recommended. Whereas Bringhurst
    seems less open to that idea. My questions are these: are there any typophiles
    that allow more flex in character spacing than what Bringhurst and Kent suggest?
    &#40;I&#39;m talking about a max of &#43;/-5%&#41; Also, Kent, are you speaking
    about book typography, or do you include magazine typography, with its tight columns
    and fast turnaround? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m aware that flexing only word spaces is more
    &#39;purist,&#39; but I rarely rely on purism for anything, and would rather settle
    for reasonable, functional, and attractive. Felici seems to contradict Bringhurst
    frequently in respect to technique, particularly since Felici is speaking specifically
    about digital typesetting, and Bringhurst is covering all typesetting. Also, Felici
    feels more realistic about the environments that typesetting is generally done
    in, wherease Bringhurst strikes me as describing typesetting ideals. They seem
    aimed at the same end results &#40;solid typography&#41;, but have varied methodologies
    and philosophies. <BR> <BR>Like Chris, I was taught next to nothing about H&amp;J&#39;s,
    and my current employer couldn&#39;t care less, so I&#39;ve taken on the responsiblity

  body: 'In response to the other recent thread on sentence and word spacing, I got
    a copy of Dowding&#39;s &#39;The Finer Points of Spacing&#39;. <BR> <BR>I think
    his views are interesting in the context of this discussion also. He begins the
    book by railing against excessive word spacing. This was apparently common &#40;in
    the &#39;40s and &#39;50s&#41; because typesetters were paid by how many &#39;ens&#39;
    they set. Thus it paid the typesetter just to end a line quick and dirty and let
    the machine space it out.  <BR> <BR>Dowding shows an example of this loose and
    sloppy style, and it makes the case that the line breaks up with excessive spacing.
    He says you can counteract the problem with more leading, but tighter word spacing
    is better. He quotes Tschichold as recommending 1/4 em and recommends this. <BR>
    <BR>Now we could note that Tschichold, supervising book production, had an economic
    interest in keeping down the number of pages, and hence going for tight spacing.
    Dowding&#39;s book itself is too tightly set in my opinion. It is in 9/12 Times
    New Roman set to a measure of 23 picas. Bringhurst says that for small type sizes
    1/3 em may be better, and from Dowding&#39;s book this seems to be so.  <BR> <BR>I
    think that in the &#39;60s, with the advent of photo type, the &#39;close but
    not touching&#39; school went overboard the other direction, of tight spacing,
    in my opinion. <BR> <BR>Now that we have such experts as Bringhurst, Spiekermann,
    Felici, and here Kent Lew and Nick Shinn all not agreeing tells me that people
    still haven&#39;t figured out the new technology of flexible word and letter spacing
    and glyph stretching, and how it relates to an optimal reading experience.  <BR>
    <BR>I think Spiekermann&#39;s refutes his own case by immediately saying that
    you shouldn&#39;t follow his own rule with &#39;Unit&#39;. Surely other faces
    respond differently, as others have said. <BR> <BR>Since InDesign is new technology,
    it would be interesting to hear what Adobe has done in testing out and developing
    its technology on this issue. '

  body: '<i>&#62;Also, Kent, are you speaking about book typography, or do you include
    magazine typography, with its tight columns and fast turnaround? </i> <BR> <BR>My
    primary frame of reference is book typography, since that is what I am most involved
    in. But some of the books I work with are two- or three-column formats as well.
    I think the general principles apply broadly. <BR> <BR>For magazine composition,
    I will use different settings than for book composition. But I will be using the
    same principles to evaluate my decisions. I judge my work against high standards,
    even though I rarely meet them.  <BR> <BR>And yes, I have to make the same compromises
    as anyone else when confronted with difficult situations or time constraints.
    Narrow columns will require more compromises than traditional book pages, generally.
    Not every piece of copy is worthy of the same attention or effort to get it just
    perfect. Sometimes you have to let less-than-preferable hyphens or somewhat loose
    lines go. I try to be practical.  <BR> <BR>I think the important thing is that
    one should know &#42;what&#42; it is you are compromising. <BR> <BR>Periodically,
    I will review my assumptions. Here is a controlled test I do now and then with
    a new face:  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll set several lines of sample text unjustified &#40;not
    greeking, but actual text, something representative of the type of work I&#39;m
    currently doing&#41; with hard returns at the end of each line.  <BR> <BR>Then
    I take every third line and apply progressively tighter tracking in -.5 unit increments
    -- i.e., the first and second lines are set normal character spacing, the third
    line is -.5 units, the next two lines are normal, the sixth line is -1 unit, etc.
    &#40;Sometimes, I&#39;ll even mix them up more randomly. And sometimes I&#39;ll
    do the same thing with progressively looser tracking, too.&#41; <BR> <BR>Then
    I set this aside and come back to it later. I try reading the text and note when
    the words become noticeably tight &#40;or loose&#41;. It is difficult to be a
    reader and at the same time try to pay attention to the reading itself; this is
    by no means a perfectly objective test. But by this method, I establish my parameters
    and tolerances.  <BR> <BR>&#43;/- 5% is really excessive -- note that this is
    equivalent to 10 units in Quark. I find that I cannot abide more than 2 units
    &#40;1%&#41;, and am more comfortable with 1 unit. <BR> <BR>My bottom line is
    that word spacing is more flexible than character spacing. As a reader, I can
    tolerate greater variation in word spacing, much more than I can tolerate distorted
    word shapes through even seemingly modest variations in character spacing. <BR>
    <BR>I am, perhaps, admittedly old-fashioned in my aesthetic, as Nick points out.  <BR>
    <BR>I think the important thing is to keep looking and analyzing and learning.
    Notice good composition; notice bad composition; what works and what doesn&#39;t.
    Consider what makes it so. Develop and refine your own discrimination and judgement.  <BR>
    <BR>Then you won&#39;t so much need Rules. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

    help with future projects my plan is to set up a sample document with several
    repetions of the same two paragraphs in the same type box and then create a variety
    of H&amp;J styles based on the numbers discussed in this thread. When I have a
    new project I should then be able to quickly set the type in the desired font

  body: '&#62;the box for Standard Em Space is checked <BR> <BR>1. An em space is
    two en spaces. <BR> <BR>2. This width is not derived from or related to the width
    of the normal space character. <BR> <BR>3. Type &#34;option space&#34; to insert
    an en space <BR> <BR>4. If the box is checked, the width of the em space will
    equal the point size of the type. &#40;And the em space will be an em &#34;square&#34;.
    In fact, a pica is merely a 12 pt. em. In hand composition the length of a line
    of type, or a column of type, measured in ems, is significant. In particular,
    typesetting was priced by the em. Also, knowing the number of characters per em
    in a font aids in copyfitting --and for this reason line lengths are also measured
    in ems. Furthermore, the em square, being a little piece of metal with a symmetrical
    cross section, has a strong aesthetic presence, enabling the typographer to conceptualize
    and design space in a scalar, proportional manner, rather than through absolute
    distances. The zen of the em.&#41; <BR> <BR>5. If the box is unchecked &#40;Quark
    default&#41;, the em space will be the width of two &#34;0&#34;s -- ie the en
    space will be the width of the figures in a font with tabular &#40;monowidth&#41;
    figures. So this may be useful for some kinds of tabular work with figures, and
    I would imagine that&#39;s the reason for this Quark option.  <BR> <BR>6. The
    difference between the options is more apparent in a condensed or extended typeface.
    <BR> <BR>7. In 15 years, I&#39;ve never used the em/en space in Quark. Maybe that&#39;s
    my loss -- but does anyone have examples where it&#39;s been useful? <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Alyce, Nick gave a good explanation of the difference between the standard
    and Quark default em spaces. But let me summarize: a standard em space is a relative
    unit equal to the point size; the Quark default em space is variable defined as
    twice the value of the width of the 0 &#40;zero&#41; in a font. So the standard
    em space is size-dependent, while the Quark default is size- &#42;and&#42; font-dependent.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;I believe this default was inherited from some phototypesetting
    systems and may have some validity when working with tabular matter or extremely
    condensed fonts. But not as the default, IMO.&#41; <BR> <BR>The reason I recommend
    checking the Standard Em square is that it makes some things more predictable.  <BR>
    <BR>Although the word spacing is based on percentages of the spaceband character
    width in a given font, character spacing is determined in units which are 1/200th
    of an em space. I believe that Quark calculates this differently based on the
    preference setting for the value of the em space. &#40;There&#39;s a slim chance
    that I&#39;m wrong and that it uses the point size value regardless of whether
    the standard em space is checked; but I don&#39;t think I am. I&#39;d have to
    go back and do controlled tests to confirm.&#41; <BR> <BR>Nick, I use the en and
    em spaces periodically. One example is when I have a run-in C-head. Frequently
    I will decide to style the head in a bold sans serif, set it without any terminal
    punctuation, and use an en or em space &#40;depending on the line measure&#41;
    before the beginning of the paragraph proper.  <BR> <BR>Sometimes I will use an
    en space following a graphic bullet, when the list is not being set hanging.  <BR>
    <BR>I will also frequently use an en or em space before an end-of-story dingbat.
    <BR> <BR>The most important reason I choose to check the standard em space is
    that I use the Quark flex space as a thin &#40;or hair&#41; space, and the flex
    space is defined as a percentage of the en space &#40;which in turn is determined
    by the definition of the em space&#41;. I like to define the flex space at 25%
    &#40;which yields an M/8 space&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I then frequently use this flex/thin/hair
    space to slightly separate em dashes -- a compromise between the two competing
    camps of closed or open em dashes, and again, a convention that I&#39;ve derived
    from traditional setting.  <BR> <BR>I also like to use this flex space to separate
    the multiply symbol in dimensions, or sometimes in botanical hybrid names &#40;depending
    upon how the typeface sets and where I&#39;m taking the multiply from&#41;.  <BR>

  body: Alyce, your idea for a sample comparison document is not a bad one. But I
    will say that so much depends upon the quality of your actual text &#40;is it
    punchy journalism with a lot of short terse words or is it academic text with
    a lot of long jargon, for instance&#41; and the line measure &#40;narrow column
    vs. full-page measure&#41; that a standard document may not be adequate. <BR>
    <BR>A slightly different approach that I might recommend is to create a resource
    document in which you develop several H&amp;J styles -- for instance, your Standard
    might be 80% / 100% / 133%, but then you define a Tight at 75% / 100% / 133% and
    a Tighter at 67% / 90% / 125%, or some such &#40;these are just random examples&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Then when you start a new project and you&#39;re establishing your line
    length and type size and leading, you can import &#40;&#34;Append,&#34; in Quark
    lingo&#41; these H&amp;J styles from your resource document and quickly apply
    them to your actual text.  <BR> <BR>&#40;Once you&#39;ve made your decisions and
    the work begins in earnest, you may wish to delete any unused H&amp;J styles to
    prevent confusion later.&#41; <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR> <BR>

    color of my Quark guides to paler, subtler versions of the garish and distracting
    defaults. It&#39;s surprising how much nicer it is. <BR> <BR>[EDIT] Oh, I just
    thought of another &#40;which is probably more common&#41;: use the enter/ return
    key on the number keypad to insert the equivalent of a page break, that will kick
    the next text element to the next column/text box &#40;depending on what the situation
    is&#41;. Shift &#43; numeric keypad return forces it to the next box, overriding
    any columns, if I&#39;m not mistaken. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I believe the &#39;flush
    zone&#39; is an area that forces the last line in a justified paragraph to justify
    flush with the right side when it gets inside of a certain zone. I think. I&#39;ve
    never used it. That would probably explain why setting it to zero doesn&#39;t
    seem to have much effect.&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: Em -- <BR> <BR>The flush zone is exactly as Chris says. The value you enter
    for flush zone will determine when the H&amp;J engine will stretch the last line
    of a justified paragraph. A setting of zero means that it will never force justify
    the last line. <BR> <BR>Some typographers prefer that if a last line gets close
    to the full measure, it should go ahead and be set full justified. <BR> <BR>If
    you want to see this effect, set your flush zone to something fairly large, like
    25% of your column width. Then apply to some text. If you have a paragraph with
    a last line at least 75% of the measure, you&#39;ll see that it gets stretched
    out to full justify. <BR> <BR>A more realistic range for an appropriate flush
    zone setting is on the order of a few points, if at all. I personally never use
    it. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    and loose. I find that depending on the typeface and its own defaults this is
    useful. Also it's a good way to either pick up a straggling word at the end of
    a paragraph (often mistakenly called a widow) or conversely to spread the paragraph
    out to fill out the last line.\r\n\r\nTIght: min 70%, Opt. 85%, Max 100%\r\nRegular:
