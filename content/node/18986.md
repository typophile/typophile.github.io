  a hardware store. My concept is based on a beaver and wood textures, but I\u2019m
  having a lot of trouble finding a typeface to fit this design. \r\n\r\nCan anyone
  suggest for me a typeface that is suitable for the logo? I was thinking a font that\u2019s
  chipped or textured that reflects this nature. \r\n\r\nIf anyone can suggest another
  typeface or one that would fit better, that\u2019ll be great too! \r\n\r\nThanks.
  \r\n\r\nVincent.     \r\n"

    target="_blank">this item</a> useful. The romance copy mentions porcupines, but
    it's probably equally suitable for beavers.

  body: "Wow! Those are some really nice suggestions everyone! Thanks guys! =) \r\n\r\nI
    really like Chase, Grot Wood, and Vendetta cause they got a really nice design
    or texture to it.   \r\n\r\nAre there any fonts that look like they've been chewed
    i.e. bitten off maybe?? I was thinking more of a funny theme generated from the
    typeface. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, I very much appreciate your opinions and recommendations!
    Keep the comments rolling! =) \r\n\r\nVincent. "
