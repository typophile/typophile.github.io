  body: "The title at least looks like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=kievit&x=0&y=0\">FF
    Kievit</a>. (If the caps aren't wide enough, try the smallcaps.)\r\n\r\nThe text
    scan is a bit small but could be Kievit too as far as I can tell."

  body: "Kievit looks right on the money for the type on the inside as well. What
    did they do to the \"S\" on the cover? Appears they used 'black' and did an offset
    on the path to change to weight to something more like 'extra bold'.\r\n\r\nYikes,
    my suggestions were awful... no more IDs for me while watching football. :\\\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chap-01_4736.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Title-02_6263.gif]"

  body: "Well, the \"G\" looked close to Myriad... too bad the rest was WAY off. :P\r\n\r\nI
    got the page sample from Amazon... clicked on the cover image and flipped through
    the pages."
