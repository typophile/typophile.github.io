  the G's spur [and its date of production], I'd identify this as Gotham.\r\n\r\nThe
  opening titles were done by Stephen Frankfurt. There are at least two weights of
  the type in question used. It's quite close to a tightly kerned Akzidenz Grotesk
  Bold, but feels a bit shorter. Could it be a lesser-known version of a famous typeface,
  say, Ludlow's Record Gothic? Could it be small caps? Were small caps ever offered
  with Franklin/News/Trade Gothic?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GNJvBtrUrg\">The
  opening titles on YouTube</a>, I link to this one with an alternate soundtrack because
  of the ones I've found, this one distorts the picture's dimensions the least.\r\n\r\n<a

    (AG Old Face might even be a better fit, but it wasn''t designed until 1984.)
    [EDIT: should have read the description more carefully -- looks like you''ve ruled
    Akzidenz out]'

    family as the rest of it.
