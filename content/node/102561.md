body: "<strong>Let me start with a well known one, at the early stages of typography:</strong>\r\n\r\nThis
  is the story about <strong>Laurens Janszoon Koster</strong> sailor and innkeeper
  from the city of Harleem (Netherlands). A sunny day around 1430 he was going for
  a stroll with his grandchildren in the Haarlemmerhout woods (near the city), where
  he started to play a game by cutting letters from pieces of old beech trees, just
  for the amusement of his siblings. After a while he started making the game more
  interesting by using ink and printing the letters, and that was when he realized
  about the real possibilities of this process...\r\n\r\nKoster begun by improving
  the ink, then he mounted a small printing workshop. While doing his first job (Speculum
  Humanae Salvationis) he changed the wood type by a stronger metal type (made of
  lead & tin), and his business started to grow and grow, so he hired more people.\r\n\r\nOn
  Christmas eve, 1941 while Koster was at church with his family, one of his employees
  called Johannes went to the printing workshop and stole all of his metal type, then
  fled to Mainz. A year after that, Johannes Gutenberg printed his first jobs in Mainz.
  \r\n\r\nThis story was written by Hadrianus Junius in 1568, he also wrote that another
  employee of Koster 's printing workshop told him about Johannes being the thief
  of the metal type... somthing like the bad Santa Claus that made Koster miserable.
  \ Some say that there are still metal wine cups forged with Koster's metal type...\r\n\r\nHere
  is the first portrait of Koster holding a type piece, with a very interesting look...\r\n\r\n<img

  body: "Hi Fernando, as so many stories from the past this is a myth \u2014 due to
    the nationalistic movements of the 19th century, with the intention of claiming
    historical breakthroughs for their purposes.\r\n\r\nThere IS a statue of Coster
    (note the spelling with a /c/) in Haarlem, but there is no serious historian nowadays
    who will support the notion of Coster having invented printing instead of Gutenberg.\r\n\r\nNow,
    on a different tack, the invention of telephony is e completely different story\u2026
    A G Bell stole that, of course\u2026 : )"

  body: Yes :) I was referring to Legend, as in myths, stories that could be true
    or not, related to type. Like the tombstone of John Baskerville... or Griffo's
    involvement in a murder with a metal type... :)

  body: "+ 1 for Matthew and Verdana - both have achieved mythic status, which may
    be true or not! \r\n\r\nHowever it's no myth that Griffo was hung for murdering
    his son-in-law with a  metal bar. That's fact not mythology! "

  body: Mmm... not so much, Griffo was charged with murder, but the weapon, most say
    it was something like an iron bar, the metal type is the interesting part of the
    myth...
