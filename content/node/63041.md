  is an amiable rounded sans-serif inspired by handwriting. Sovba is useful for a
  look that is uniquely casual, fresh and smooth. Sovba simplifies character forms
  down to their basic characteristics, and has a strong, silky smooth forward motion.\r\n\r\nSovba
  includes more traditional optional alternates for a number of characters, including
  the E and F, OpenType alternate characters, old style figures and small caps. Sovba
  is a fine choice when you require a versatile upright oblique for logotypes, headlines
  or short blocks of text. Available from [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/sovba/|MyFonts.com]].
