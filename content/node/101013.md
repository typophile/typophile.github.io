  is used for space between words and what kind of space should be used after the
  dot in abbreviations such as <i>Ph. D.</i>\r\n\r\nI have only recently found out
  that French typographic rules demand a four-per-em space, and not your usual one,
  after \xAB and before \xBB.\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering whether any such advice exists
  for interword space."

    forgot to ask whether there are any considerations for spaces before and after
    the en dash."

  body: "There are *conventions* -- not regulations. They also change over time, and
    with general style.\r\n\r\nFor example, the four-to-em space you mention with
    guillemots in French wouldn't be right if someone were setting ragged right and
    was using a font where four-to-em was a normal word space. Remember, you get a
    4-to-em space with a spaceband value of 250 units (with a 1000 unit em). \r\n\r\nMost
    newer fonts use a smaller nominal value than 250 units for the spaceband -- I've
    seen 190 units a fair bit, and that's smaller than a 5-to-em. If you use a hard
    4-to-em between the guillemots and a word, the resulting space would be larger
    than the nominal word space when set with many fonts.\r\n\r\nAs to periods after
    initials -- it is a matter of style. Chicago style is to us a word space with
    initials, as in\r\n\r\nG. E. M. Anscombe\r\n\r\nAssociated Press style is to not
    use any extra space\r\n\r\nG.E.M. Anscombe\r\n\r\nEtc. in other constructions.\r\n\r\nSo
    -- you get a lot of theories from typographers, but rarely the assumptions they
    are based on -- e.g., how big is a wordspace. Moreover, in the largest portion
    of the world of words, editorial style is the determining factor. Typographer's
    opinions are often marked \"P.E.\"\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'In the case of an abbreviation such as Ph.D., the answer to the question
    of what kind of space to put after the period inside the abbreviation is usually
    "none", at least in the United States. In most editorial styles, for such abbreviations
    the periods are closed up or else omitted: "Ph.D." or "PhD", with the latter being
    the more common nowadays.'
