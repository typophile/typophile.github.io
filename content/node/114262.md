    about forty or more years ago when phototype took over, you've left out a whole
    generation of production processes. \r\n\r\nBut you are correct about quality,
    but only in some quarters. There are many quality font developers out there who
    are just as good, if not better, than their predecessors."

  body: "This might also be phrased the other way around, i.e. What are your opinions
    on the gain of consolidating the multi-stage process into one?\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I don\u2019t think the division of labor is irrevocably dependent on the state
    of technology, more to the maturity of the industry that centers on that technology.
    Now, many foundries separate the processes of concept, design, and production.\r\n\r\nDigital
    fonts have been around for 25 years. The \u201Cquality of typeface created\u201D
    has changed dramatically, from Matrix and Template Gothic to Gotham and Brandon
    Grotesque. The watershed was Zuzana Licko\u2019s Filoso\uFB01a."

    used \"digital\" type. Not sure I want either side of that one.\r\n\r\nFor the
    OP's term paper, it's the checking that matters. How does the type perform, with
    the materials involved. But checking on what? \r\n\r\nWhat's changed is those
    materials -- nowadays, a font has to work with pixels on a screen, the range running
    from a 72-dpi computer monitor to a 300-dpi phone or tablet, soon higher still,
    I'll bet.\r\n\r\nAnd with ink, dry toner(s) with inkjet or laser -- and printers
    having different resolutions & software, to the inks (soy or otherwise) with high-resolution
    offset printing.\r\n\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\nNot a reasonable question, IMO"

  body: "Right. I was thinking in the context of this thread, of how Fontographer,
    which was introduced in 1986, changed the business, by making it possible for
    one person to make fonts.\r\n\r\nEarlier, in a small design studio in 1978, I
    had been using an Itek Quadritek typesetting system. It was phototype, but the
    process was controlled with a \u201Ccommand line interface\u201D.\r\n\r\nThe Quadritek,
    and the Compugraphic system used by many typesetting companies in Toronto at the
    time, had digital front ends.\r\n\r\nhttp://macpro.freeshell.org/quadritek/q1.html\r\n\r\nBut
    those earlier systems were part of the old type design set-up, split up into different
    specialist jobs."

    \"digital\" type.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAccording to the Linotype website, Linotron
    202 was launched in 1978. The characters were stored as long-vector outlines so
    this was already pretty digital. Peter Karow\u2019s Ikarus was presented at ATypI
    Warzawa in 1975. By that time there were also others who had been working on digital
    formats and software for digitizing, storing and rendering typefaces but experts
    of that time such as Robert Norton referred to Ikarus as \u2018the only game in
    town\u2019. \r\n\r\nThis is not where digital type started though \u2026 In their
    well researched book on Dr.-Ing. Rudolf Hell, which also covers the history of
    Hell Digiset (Hell\u2019s digital typesetting system), Boris Fuchs and Christian
    Onnasch mention that the development of digital typesetting started with the Linotype
    1010 in 1955. This machine scanned characters from a photomatrix and output them
    on photographic film by a CRT. As they did not store the characters, the process
    was not fully digital. The authors mention the start of digital typesetting at
    Hell in February 1964. By February 1965 the first typeface was coded on paper
    tape for CRT-output. In March the typeface date was converted from paper tape
    to a new magnetical storage medium that had just been developed by Siemens. The
    typeface matrix was 30 x 48 dots \u2026 In May and July Hell digitized its first
    sans serif. Other literature suggests that this may have been Digi Grotesk N (similar
    to Neuzeit-Grotesk). The first Digiset system was presented at the industry fair
    in Hanover, Germany in April 1966. The first working system was sold to RCA/USA
    in June 1966. The authors write that, after having convinced themselves that the
    Hell concept was better that their Videocomp, RCA decided to sell Hell\u2019s
    Digiset typesetting system. RCA sold over 100 systems. \r\n\r\nConcluding from
    these sources, Think we may say that digital type dates back to February 1965
    (from the Hell perspective). By this month, February 2014, that\u2019s about 49
    years ago \u2026"
