body: "I was wondering if someone could comment on something I don't understand about
  kerning.\r\n\r\nMy font is named \"dugud\". The attached image shows two words \"offkey\"
  then \"iffy\". The ligatures in both are in red. In \"offkey\" there's ligature
  sub for \"ffk\". In \"iffy\" there's a ligature for \"ff\".\r\n\r\nNote the arrows
  above. I can kern between the initial \"o\" in offset and the following \"ffk\"
  ligature (black arrow). I cannot kern at all between the \"ffk\" and the following
  \"e\" (orange arrow).\r\n\r\nFor the word \"iffy\" the situation is the same. At
  the black arrow I can kern, at the orange arrow I cannot.\r\n\r\nThe type sample
  was created in Illustrator. If I turn off ligature substitution I can kern everything.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDoug\r\n"

    to some of our friends at Adobe and perhaps it can be looked into, and if it is
    an Illustrator bug it might get fixed in some future release.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: This is funny, I've experienced it before and thought that it was just the
    way it is. I noticed that a workaround is to kern the ending letter pair beforehand
    and it would reflect once the ligature was activated, if that makes sense. It
    will be nice to have a fix for this.

  body: "IMHO, Illustrator is indeed so have not \"friendly\" with otf feature, LoL.
    But the problem also would be recheck to the \"kerning classes\" groups definition.
    I Just remembering you. Think, In this case, kerning for \"k\" and \"f\" should
    be separate to be two session: \r\n\"k\" ----> \"k_left\" and \"k_right\". Same
    way for \r\n\"f\" ----> \"f_left\" and \"f_right\". \r\n\r\nAnd then:\r\n\"ffk\"
    should be completely grouping with \"k_left\" and \"f_right\", and\r\n\"ff\" should
    be completely grouping with \"f_left\" and \"f_right\"\r\n\r\nI hope this correct.
    \r\nNice to introducing you.\r\nBest regards."

  body: "@andiawmasry: I don't think you understand the bug report. You can't do *manual*
    kerning in Illustrator between the ligature and a following glyph. It's nothing
    to do with whether the font's built-in kerning was properly constructed. (Though
    it would be interesting to see if Illustrator also fails to correctly use the
    built-in kerning between a ligature and a following glyph.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
