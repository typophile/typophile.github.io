  newspapers. Would be great if people could help me identify the typeface so that
  I can analyse the choices in relation to its history and culture.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help. And in case anyone is wondering, I didn't upload the biggest local
  paper, The Straits Times, because I know it uses Big Caslon!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BTnameplate_5980.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BTweekendnameplate_3652.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mypapernameplate_5825.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sundaytimesnameplate_6248.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TNPnameplate_3648.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TODAYnameplate_3939.jpg]"
