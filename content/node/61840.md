  body: I considered that, but I think it's got to somehow look more contemporary
    that either Univers or Frutiger. Maybe think Myriad, rather than Frutiger, but
    extended and blacker.

  body: "That's quite nice, Chris. Love the small caps. \r\n\r\nThe project is on
    hold (it's for a logo), but I'm thinking I'm actually going to have to finesse
    a handful of Frutiger glyphs per the client's request. Eventually."
