  together. The event is the Multicultural Day. What its all about is a day dedicated
  to many different cultures and what not.\r\n\r\nThe assignment was to focus on the
  theme of, \u201CMulticultural Day 2009: Cultural Dimensions of Democracy.\u201D
  I think it turned out awesome, what do you guys think?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRskate2"

    like to know why you changed the relative sizes of the continents?\r\nSo Antarctica
    is now roughly the size of Asia,\u2026\_what\u2019s that supposed to mean?\r\n\r\nI
    can\u2019t really tell you anything about the type, only that it still needs a
    lot of work."

    if you spent some time on it. Design is never good when it is rushed.

  body: "agree with everything above.\r\n\r\nrandom letters sharing words, weird strikethroughs,
    continents the same size (are you trying to say they're all of equal importance
    or something?)\r\n\r\nno real rhyme or reason for angling certain words. drab
    color, strange switching up of type and weights. \r\n\r\ni think it could be rad
    if you spent more time on it"
