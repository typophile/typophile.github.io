  is for those who have time :)\r\n\r\nI'm searching for fonts with (I don't know
  how to exactly say) charming, softy, \"approachable\" italics and especially bold
  italics. For sans and serifs separately. Maybe I better quote examples. \r\n\r\nFor
  sans something like beautiful Serrano or TodayS...\r\nFor serifs like Dolly, Fedra
  serif (not so softy but memorable)...\r\n\r\n\r\nFire at will :)\r\nThnx!"
