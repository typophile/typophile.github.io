  know some important issues about fontographer: <BR> <BR>1- Do you set kerning pairs
  for acentuated characters like &#34;&Agrave;&#34;, &#34;&Acirc;&#34;, &ouml;?  <BR>A
  professional font must got it?  <BR> <BR>In that case: Does exits, for example,
  some way to copy the kerning pairs setted for &#34;A&#34; to the character &#34;&Agrave;&#34;?  <BR>What
  is the usual way to do that? <BR> <BR> <BR>2- What&#39;s is the object of the command
  &#34;Equalize sidebearings&#34;. I see some font which got it and other fonts doesn&#39;t.
  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s only good for the numbers?  <BR>This must be  made at the end
  of the process of designing a font? <BR> <BR>Sorry for my lack of fonto-skills and
  &#42;THANKS&#42;... <BR> <BR>Ramiro. '

  body: ' Ramiro -- <BR> <BR>To set kerning pairs for accents the same as their base
    character, you can use the Metrics &#62; Kerning Assistance command.  <BR> <BR>For
    example, if you want to extend the kerning from TA, VA, WA, YA to T&Aring;, V&Agrave;,
    W&Auml;, Y&Aacute;, etc., you would set the Equivalent First Letters to T V W
    Y and set the Equivalent Second Letters to A &Aacute; &Agrave; &Acirc; &Auml;
    &Atilde; &Aring;. You would turn off the Link All for the first set &#40;so that
    TA doesn&#39;t become the same as VA&#41; and turn on the Link All for the second
    set &#40;so that T&Aacute; becomes the same as TA&#41;. <BR> <BR>Whether you include
    these pairs depends upon the target audience for your font, and upon how compulsively
    thorough you want to be. &#40;Note, however, that some combinations like W&Agrave;,
    for example, may be nonexistent, given that most languages that I&#39;m aware
    of which use the Agrave don&#39;t have the W.&#41; <BR> <BR>I personally think
    it&#39;s important in this day and age to kern accents &#40;I&#39;m obsessive/compulsive,
    I admit it&#41;, but many foundries &#40;especially U.S. ones&#41; don&#39;t necessarily
    include them. I&#39;m not sure if this is from laziness, or a holdover from the
    early days when large kerning tables bogged down processors. <BR> <BR>I have not
    found any use for the Equalize Sidebearings. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps. <BR> <BR>--
