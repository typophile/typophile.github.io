body: "I just stumbled across these drawings by a bloke called Tom Mazullo. He seems
  to have a nice obsession with type and the mechanical. Though he's obviously drawing
  his letters for other purposes I thought you lot might appreciate them. They have
  an endearing material quality to them.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.tommazzullo.com/almost1.html|Almost
