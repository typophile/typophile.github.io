body: I'm looking for a script that has the feel of car or airplane styling, sort
  of 50's-ish. (I'm afraid I'm not describing this well). Something akin to Air Conditioner.
  Would very much appreciate your suggestions.

    and for pointing out new directions. The back slant on Cottingley is an interesting
    twist on what I was envisioning in my head."

    Script.
