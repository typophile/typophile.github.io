  pretty tight budget, so unfortunately I can't spend a lot on fonts.\r\n\r\nI have
  Calluna for the body copy, it's a nice font and the price was right.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I am looking for is a font for the display. Does anyone have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nI've
  been experimenting with Otama e.p. ( http://freetypography.com/2011/09/29/free-font-otama-e-p/
  ) but I worry that not having italics could be trouble down the road.\r\n\r\nI've
  also been trying Cicle ( http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Cicle )\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  any advice would be appreciated!"

  body: "Sorry, you're right, I should have been a bit more specific!\r\n\r\nIt's
    a fashion magazine for trendy women 18-35. It features profiles on celebrities
    as well as the usual fashion runway fare. \r\n\r\nThe client generally wants to
    keep things clean, lots of white space, simple colour palette. Hopefully that
    helps give you more information."

  body: AW Conqueror (http://typophile.com/node/73718) no italics, but enough styles
    to use for emphasis.

  body: "Hmmm I actually do have Conqueror already, didn't think of trying it though.
    Thanks!\r\n\r\nActually, looking at the Conqueror specimen, I forgot it had so
    many different styles & ligatures. Might be worth using it since I'm hoping to
    keep the columns consistent but also would like some variety in the features.\r\n\r\nVilla
    Didot seems interesting as well. Didot is usually the go-to style for fashion
    mags, is it not? "
