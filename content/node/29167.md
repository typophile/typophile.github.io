  in general look a little more rounded, is it just my eyes/the printing/scan? oh
  and i can't find a cut of Caslon to match the italic, any ideas?\r\n\r\nthanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sartre_3655.jpg]"

    Caslon</a> to me. The stress on the m is distinctive. \r\n\r\nI hear what you're
    saying about the lightness -- the thins look too thin. But I think that has to
    do with the way it was printed or scanned. Look at the ascender on the f to see
    how the thin lines are disappearing in this scan.\r\n\r\nSkylar"

    on book design' i had omitted to note that the cover was designed in 1969, apologies
    this would perhaps explain the subtle differences, im guessing that big caslon
    is the closest that im going to find digitally? "

    Caslon was done in 1994, so it's definitely not that. Also the squashed non-descending
    J and the strange a are something Carter wouldn't have drawn.  \r\n\r\nDepending
    on the size you want digital Caslon 540 might do you fine. Given that it's Penguin
    and English, English Monotype 337, which Patty mentioned, is a likely guess also,
    but I don't have any copy of the Roman. \r\n\r\nYou'd probably have to do the
    research on large sizes of metal 337 and 540 to nail it definitely, unless it's
    photo type, which I kind of doubt. \r\n\r\nThis won't be digital, of course.  \r\n\r\n"

    over the centuries in what we call Caslon. And when was the \"J\" introduced into
    type?\r\n\r\nThat said:\r\n1) Caslon wasn't really a \"quality is job 1\" kind
    of guy... Like much of his variation between sizes is just slobbery.\r\n2) What
    point size is this sample? Scale is central to type, and Caslon wasn't a specialist

  body: ">Do you mean somebody else drew those?\r\n\r\nYes, I suspect it's not from
    the Caslon foundry, but a large size of ATF 540 or Monotype 337--or maybe Ludlow,
    as it's so large. It would look even more irregular if it was the real thing.
    Also it would have more 'moxie' and a probably more even color. \r\n\r\n>And when
    was the \u201CJ\u201D introduced into type?\r\n\r\nCaslon drew non-descending
    J's, one of which at least is pretty ugly--with a tiny ball at the terminal, like
    this one. \r\n\r\nI suspect this is a re-drawing of actual Caslon, but not the
    real thing. The round arches on the o and e are light compared to the stem of
    the n, and that's not usual with Caslon. But his stuff is sometimes so irregular
    that you never can tell. Neither Big Caslon not digital Caslon 540 have the light
    o and e. "

    not (too early). These covers were printed litho, but from metal type composition.
    The type was photographed, resulting in a negative through which an offset plate
    was exposed. Due to (under)exposure the hairlines got thinner.\r\n\r\nAlso note
    that Wo is kerned. Of course, kerned logotypes ware available, and, too, kerning
    was possible by filing. But I assume it is more likely that the lettering was
    hand drawn, or at least a work-up from the original composition..\r\n"

      such as phone books, catalogues, magazines and newspapers, is quite something
      different than cover design. Let alone that Caslon and other distinguished display
      faces were available as photomatrices.\r\n\r\nAnyway, what I described above

    Baines' Penguin by Design</a> and credited to Derek Birdsall at Omnific, but the
    date given there is 1983. Either the publisher, or the designer has lost track
    of the dates. Either way, this is still a long time before Big Caslon, but if
    it was done in the early eighties, almost certainly Ludwig is right. Most of the
    studios in London at that time were artworking from phototypesetting and re-photographing
    their paste-ups. If you have access to any old phototypesetter catalogues (maybe
    Agfa/Scangraphic?) you might find it there.
