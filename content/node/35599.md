  body: "Definitely!\r\n\r\nPS: I believe Eurostile, which originated in the early
    1960s, is a more comprehensive version of Microgramma, which was an all caps font
    dating back to the early 1950s. As I recall, the same Swiss designers worked on
    both.\r\n"

    and extra weights.

  body: "<em> >Why changing the name of a font when lowercase characters are added?
    </em>\r\n\r\nMarketing! When Eurostile was brought out, it was a new type family.
    They still kept selling Microgramma, as far as I know. More type families in the
    catalog can often lead to more sales.\r\n\r\n<em> >Do font names change when cyrillic
    characters are added?</em>\r\n\r\nNo. Sometimes, the name might be appended with
    a \"Pro\" or \"Plus\" or \"Super\" or \"Awesome\" or \"Whatever\" though."

    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=microgramma+&x=18&y=10\">Microgramma</a>
    fonts on FontShop: \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> Both have lowercase characters</li>\r\n<li>Elsner+Flake
    \  sells Microgramma in 2 styles: extended medium and extended bold</li>\r\n<li>URW
    \ sells Microgramma in 3 styles: extended medium, extended bold and extended bold
    shadow</li>\r\n<li>Linotype Library  sells Eurostile in 10 styles (with condensed
    and normal, an additional demi weight, and italics)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nand I have
    the feeling I am still missing part of the story."

    (paratype.com), I found \"Magistral\" and \"Micra\" with cyrillic characters and
    saw <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=square+721&x=0&y=0&sample_text=GATOR&sample_size=36\">Square
    721</a> in the list...\r\n\r\n[edit] Moreover, looking for Eurostile on the same
    site, I found <a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/pstore/default.asp?fcode=TM_ERP&letter=E\"><strong>Europe</strong></a>
    with plenty of styles, and cyrillic characters. It is said: <em>The typeface was
    designed at TypeMarket in 1992-1993 by Alexey Kustov. Similar to Eurostile by
    Aldo Novarese, 1962, Nebiolo.</em> [note:  The character set is just cyrillic
    standard]."
