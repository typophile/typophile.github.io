<p>&ldquo;Text set in Janson 11 on 14.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What does the &ldquo;11 on 14&rdquo; mean?  I believe I recall seeing &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->n<!-- raw HTML omitted --> point on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->m<!-- raw HTML omitted --> point&rdquo; or something similar, so I now believe that the numbers are point sizes.</p>

<p>Really? Do you mean, perhaps, that they didn’t have any in your shop, or that they couldn’t be used with Monotype (for some reason I don’t know about)?</p>
<p>Here’s the relevant page from the 1923 ATF catalog offering 1 point leads in assorted lengths (apologies for the quick and dirty phone snapshot):</p>

<p>Ah, okay. That explains it. Makes sense now.</p>
<p>Yeah, “lead” as a term for spacing material is only partly related to lead, the metal.</p>
<p>Some were made of type metal (although a softer alloy, I think, so you could more easily trim to fit — but I could be wrong), and type metal, in turn, is only partly composed of lead. But 1pt leads were typically made from brass.</p>
<p>I don’t know that it’s so much an oxymoron, as a bit of a misnomer.</p>
<p>Or maybe some of both.</p>

Leading is by definition added between
lines of type to make them further apart*.
There&rsquo;s such a thing as &ldquo;internal leading&rdquo;

of the design, not something a typesetter

<p>I do remember that the Monotype shop could cast, or get from somewhere, 1.5 pt leads, which they colored purple to differentiate them. Probably the reason for not using brass leads is that if everything&rsquo;s made from type metal, you can just dump the whole mess in the cauldron when you&rsquo;re done printing — no sorting required.</p>

<p>Indeed, good point. What you describe above is
such a case - where essentially the talus is negative.</p>

they don&rsquo;t even have overshoots for the round parts!

<p>Yep. The words may have different definitions, but in common usage &ldquo;leading&rdquo; is often used instead of &ldquo;line spacing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I heard a dictionary editor say that when 2 words (or phrases) have similar meanings, the shorter one often becomes dominant, and this might be another example of that.</p>

<p>mars0i — It&rsquo;s still very much in use (or so I&rsquo;d like to believe), but you&rsquo;re right that it&rsquo;s only by small specialty presses. It now belongs, along with the letterpress printing processes, more to the realm of fine art than the world of mass production. The shop I was at, though, did get some big projects, like the official new edition of the Book of Mormon, which had to be typeset EXACTLY like the first edition, including the following word division on the title page:</p>

<p>Indeed. I also see this when languages are mixed. For example
in Armenian the word for &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; is six syllables! So we
say &ldquo;merci&rdquo;&hellip; :-/  And I&rsquo;ve caught myself saying the Armenian
&ldquo;mintchayt&rdquo; (which means &ldquo;while in reality&rdquo;) while speaking
English; my sister uses &ldquo;Ya&rsquo;ni&rdquo; (Arabic for &ldquo;What I mean is&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;I mean, come on, really!&quot;) in the same way.</p>
<p>Something else: a single syllable is ofter too short,
especially in proper names, which acquire a diminutive
suffix (as an endearment). When speaking Armenian for
example &ldquo;Tom&rdquo; often becomes &ldquo;Tomig&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So in Fig. 4. - Plan of type, 5.&lsquo;Line-to-Back ,is today&rsquo;s line spacing?  Or would it be 8. of the same Fig. 4., the Body?</p>
<p>I also noticed comparing the illustration I snipped from wiki to the one cite from Carter &amp; Grant&rsquo;s that the Face&rsquo;s location is not the same. Which adds nicely to my confusion.  And since the letter is located up from the &lsquo;bottom&rsquo; of the stem shouldn&rsquo;t the Body be illustrated as having three segments -  Upper Body, Face, and Lower Body?  Or, Upper Shoulder, Face, and Lower Shoulder?</p>

<p>In a caps-only (metal) font this can happen.
But in that case there would definitely be
no space left below either - so that capital

<p>Yes.
Where the talus is usually partly at the top and

<p>BTW, few people use &ldquo;talus&rdquo;. Some

<p>There&rsquo;s no standard, but most type designers do seem

on the order of 5% of the Em. But some designers do
overshoot the em!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK, so my understanding, then, is that without extra leading, the distance from baseline to baseline will be Em-height + talus, for a total of roughly 1.05% of Em-height, but probably more for a tall x-height, or less for a small x-height.</p>
<p>And then, suppose, for example, I look at a serif typeface in which horizontal serifs have flat outer edges&ndash;not cupped, for example&ndash;and supposing that the top joins of the M is finished with these serifs, rather than being pointed, for example.  Then if an M appears over another on the next line, the distance between the upper edge of the top serifs on the lower M, and the bottom of the lower serifs on the upper M&ndash;that&rsquo;s the talus.  However, ascenders might extend into the space defined by these two M&rsquo;s, and bottoms of curved letters might extend down into the space, as might the points on the V and M, for example, the bottom of the J, etc.  And maybe if the typeface has very high ascenders and very low descenders, the designer would make the talus larger, I suppose.</p>
<p>Sorry for putting things in this awkward way.  I&rsquo;m trying to get a precise understanding, but I&rsquo;m trying to work around the possibility that terms are defined in ways that I didn&rsquo;t expect for a given typeface.  My understanding is that there&rsquo;s some play in the terminology.  I&rsquo;ve learned enough recently to be unsure about everything, but not enough to be sure about anything, I guess.</p>
<p>Do I have it right?</p>

<p>No, the talus is built-in to the Em-height.
So the distance from baseline to baseline = the Em.</p>
<p>The talus is basically the sum of the space
above the ascender height and below the
descender depth, within the Em.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant sort of acknowledged this, but I feel compelled to point it out again: the term “talus” is a complete Hrant neologism.</p>
<p>Don’t get too hung up on it. No professional type designer that I know uses the term. Most won’t even have heard of it (and of those who may have encountered it on this forum, I can’t think of any who have chosen to adopt it). I don’t even know anyone who bothers to refer to “internal leading.”</p>
<p>In metal, the measure of the body of a piece of type was it’s point size (and vice versa). When set without any intervening leading — or, as it was called, set “solid” — the distance between baselines was the same as the point size.</p>
<p>[This is assuming, for the sake of keeping things simple, that this is a setting of the same font on all lines.]</p>
<p>For practical reasons, metal type faces did not usually have extenders that reached to the very top or bottom edges of the piece of metal. So there would usually be a little extra space, such that descenders on one line and ascenders on the line below didn’t crash. (Hrant has chosen to coin a special term for this extra space.)</p>
<p>For the Linotype machine, this extra space had a prescribed minimum. I don’t know if foundries or Monotype had their own standards for this.</p>
<p>In digital type, there is a virtual corollary to the body, but there is no physical constraint or requirement to keep parts within the bounds of the body. Different type designers take different approaches.</p>
<p>Also, since we&rsquo;re no longer stacking little metal blocks upon one another, the virtual body has come to have less and less technical significance. In Postscript Type 1 fonts, it was still pretty explicit (in the Ascent and Descent values). But with TrueType and OpenType, there are multiple values describing various vertical metrics, all used by different platforms and applications to determine vertical relationships.</p>
<p>So, these days, setting text without any explicit linespacing measurement is not necessarily the same thing as setting metal type solid and you may or may not get a value equivalent to the point size, depending upon the platform, software, and preference settings.</p>
<p>Of course, if you explicitly specify 11 pt linespacing (or leading — however the app chooses to call it), then your application should definitely set it with a baseline-to-baseline measure of 11 points.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t make it up. I wish I remembered where I got it, but I&rsquo;m
pretty sure it was from a &ldquo;professional type designer&rdquo; :-/ sort of book.
It might have been DeVinne.</p>

<li>
<p>I use it because it&rsquo;s needed.* I&rsquo;ve heard others use &ldquo;internal
leading&rdquo; but to me that&rsquo;s lame. I haven&rsquo;t heard of anything else.
Why is it needed? Well, it&rsquo;s a relevant design parameter, since it
affects apparent size and line-to-line not-crashing. When I make
a typeface, very early on I need to figure out the vertical metrics,
and the talus is part of that. How do others do it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Not to grasp the idea, but to communicate it.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, I&rsquo;m open to a better term.
But I don&rsquo;t understand the resistance to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->having<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a term.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant — Sorry, you know I have a knee-jerk reaction to your jargon sometimes. I do remember now that you appropriated it from someone else. And DeVinne sort of rings a bell. So I’ll blame him for the failed neologism. ;-)</p>
<p>My point remains: anyone who attempts to use it in conversation with professional type designers will most likely find himself faced with blank stares.</p>
<p>I don’t dispute the value of the overall concept within a consideration of general parameters. I’ve just always engaged it from the other way around, such that there’s little point to referring to that space directly.</p>
<p>The concept that I’ve always used to approach this aspect of vertical metrics, and the one which corresponds to my historical meanderings, is “size on the body.” That’s how I’ve encountered it referred to historically. That’s how I think of it.</p>
<p>So, my approach to a new design idea is to think about the interrelationship of x-height, cap-height, ascender-height, descender-height, and overall size on the body (i.e., the sum of the ascender + descender and it’s relation to the em).</p>
<p>It seems really simple and straightforward to me — how do I want to fit my design in the em? How much clearance do I want between ascenders &amp; descenders when set solid? Which is usually also a function of what I consider to be the target size of my design.</p>
<p>Since I usually also consider how I want to split this between the head space and the foot space (also terms I’ve seen used occasionally, btw), a single new term derived from Latin for ‘ankle’ just seems silly to me.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Talus <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant says ‘I didn&rsquo;t make it up. I wish I remembered where I got it, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was from a “professional type designer” :-/ sort of book. It might have been DeVinne.’</p>
<p>It’s a normal French word, and I think the text was more likely one by a man called Fournier (his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Manuel typographique<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, 1764), someone who could be called a ‘professional type designer’. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Talus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the French for ‘slope’ or ‘angle’. He is writing about punches and matrices and metal type.</p>
<p>‘Le Graveur a encore une chose essentielle à observer; c’est de ne point donner trop de <!-- raw HTML omitted -->talus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> aux lettres, soit dans l’intérieur par le Contrepoinçons, soit à l’extérieur par la lime. Ce défaut procure au Caractère, à mesure qu’il s’use, un épaisissement desagréable.</p>
<p>In his English translation of Fournier Harry Carter makes this:</p>
<p>‘There is another thing against which the punchcutter should guard, that is giving too much <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shoulder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the letter, either with his counter-punch or outside with his file. this defect gives the character an unsightly thickening as it wears down.’</p>
<p>‘Shoulder’ is Joseph Moxon’s English word for the sloping profile of the punch.</p>
<p>The punch must have a sloping profile or you would never be able to get it out of the copper after striking it to make the matrix, nor would the type cast freely from the matrix. (But as Fournier says, if the angle is too obtuse, the type thickens up as it wears.) This profile naturally creates a slight distance between the face and the edge of the body of the metal type, and unless it is allowed to project outside the body in casting and is rubbed away (something that was often done laterally with round letters like o, which would otherwise have too wide a ‘set’) it makes a natural distance between, for example, the descenders of one line and the ascenders of the line that follows. Which is generally what the designer needs to allow for in order to avoid the clashing of descenders and ascenders.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Talus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is just the word French professional punchcutters like Nelly Gable use today for ‘slope’ when they talk about their work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I suppose I must stand corrected. Thank you for the additional insight, James, and for the pointer to Fournier.</p>
<p>While I fully understand and accept your description of how the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->talus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of a metal type is in fact the attribute which can contribute a certain clearance between descenders and ascenders in two lines set solid, I must say that I still find Hrant’s reappropriation of the term to be a bit of a stretch.</p>
<p>One might just as well describe the little bit of space between two v’s set side by side as their talus, since this same slope would have also contributed to those sidebearings.</p>
<p>But, I suppose that in a day when <!-- raw HTML omitted -->leading<!-- raw HTML omitted --> no longer means the space between lines, but is now used to refer to full distance from baseline to baseline; and when <!-- raw HTML omitted -->kern<!-- raw HTML omitted --> no longer refers to parts extending beyond the boundary, nor even solely to ad hoc spacing exceptions, but instead seems to be employed in common usage now to refer to <em>any</em> sort of spacing between letters; there’s no point in entrenching my position.</p>
<p>Hrant, feel free to use the term “talus” with impunity.</p>
<p>You’ll forgive me if I continue to chafe. (I’ll just try not to do so publicly any longer.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As a side note (and I’m sure you’re aware of this, James), Carter’s translation of the French <!-- raw HTML omitted -->talus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with “shoulder” is somewhat problematic.</p>
<p>It is clear from Fournier’s context, and from your further explanation, just which feature is being discussed. And I take it from your note that Carter was explicitly referencing Moxon’s English assignment to that same feature, about a generation previous to Fournier.</p>
<p>But wasn’t that same attribute more often referred to at the time of Carter’s translation as the “neck” or “beard”?</p>
<p>I believe “shoulder” was more often used to refer to the parallel plane below the type’s face, the difference between the two being the “depth of drive” (i.e., how deeply the punch was struck into the matrix). And this is the terminology shown in the diagrams that Hrant posted from LeGros &amp; Grant.</p>
<p>All of which is not so much to criticize Carter, as to underscore the drawbacks of anatomical terminology, which becomes ever more abstract as we carry it forward to apply to intangible features of the digital realm, now that type is no longer “something you hold in your hand.”</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My late Uncle Ben Lieberman&rsquo;s book Types of Typefaces (1968) has the terminology similar to Kent&rsquo;s usage. He defines SHOULDER as &ldquo;from the edge of the face to the front edge of the shank, sometimes called BEARD&rdquo;  He also defines PLATFORM as &ldquo;flat surface below letter; sometimes called SHOULDER&rdquo;. He defines &lsquo;drive&rsquo; as &ldquo;beveled side of raised letter; sometimes BEARD or NECK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems from Lieberman—and he was pretty careful, including consulting James!— that even in the days of metal type the usage of terms was not consistent.</p>
<p>My French dictionary defines TALUS as &ldquo;slope&rdquo; or &ldquo;embankment&rdquo;. (The shoulder of one&rsquo;s body is épaule).</p>
<p>Now that the physical shank of the piece of type is gone, and the &lsquo;body&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t privileged by being a physical thing, it seems hopeless to give the various dimensions one agreed-upon name. For example, in some circumstances, you might want to know the x-height in relation to the em. In others, the distance from the ascender to descender line, in relation to the em. In others the distance from the top black in the font (often an accent) to the top of the em, etc.</p>
<p>The terms &lsquo;em&rsquo; and &lsquo;baseline&rsquo; are well defined in the software, but beyond that, it seems like you just have to spell it out, if you&rsquo;re going to be clear.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK, terms for the parts of metal type became confused with the changing of technologies. I grant that there is a sense of ‘shoulder’ that was sometimes used in modern images of metal type, as Bill says, for  the area “from the edge of the face to the front edge of the shank”.  A beard and a shoulder are different things, or so I should hope. ‘Beard’ was used in the period of the hand press for the projecting square edge of the type which could pick up ink and spoil the impression. So the projection was often trimmed or ‘bearded’. Later, with machine printing, ‘bearding’ no longer made much sense, so the square projection was given the name ‘shoulder’ (perhaps mistakenly, but just possibly because it was a name with typographical associations that was no longer in current use).</p>
<p>‘Shoulder’ in Moxon’s original sense, which is how Carter was using it (and although Fournier had a word in French, he was clearly puzzled to find an English one for it), applied only to the sloping profile of the punch and had little (though still something) to do with the detail of the cast type. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Talus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> may seem to be an archaic survival today in typographical terms, but I know that it is still current among punchcutters because I have often heard it used by Nelly Gable when she talks about her work, and her predecessor Christian Paput used it too. The word puzzled me and drove me to try to find out what it was that they were referring to. I was delighted to find that it meant something to Hrant and was therefore in a kind of current usage, even (via this thread) an international one. It seems to me that once one works it out, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->talus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does indeed account, rather neatly, for the built-in distance between descenders and ascenders on which this thread has touched.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>{Cross-posted with James&rsquo;s latest post.}</p>
<p>Just when I was gravitating towards &ldquo;clearance&rdquo;&hellip;  :-)</p>
<p>James, thank you for digging that up! On a personal level however the
mystery persists since, although I&rsquo;ve handled the &ldquo;Manuel typographique&rdquo;
(at the incomparable Clark library) I&rsquo;ve only read it in Carter&rsquo;s translation*,
where I presume the word &ldquo;talus&rdquo; does not itself appear? But even if that&rsquo;s
the case the French origin of the term is a great lead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which I once borrowed from my letter-
press teacher and mentor, Gerald Lange.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I actually share some of the terminological unease* expressed
by Kent, especially concerning the translation. To be fair, this is an expected
byproduct of the &ldquo;translation&rdquo; from 3D to 2D (as well the &ldquo;translation&rdquo; from
the movement -and necessary subsequent extraction- of a punch to a static
volume/shape) so we can&rsquo;t expect an immaculate mapping of terms across
three centuries. As Kent points out, looking at the Legros &amp; Grant diagram**
one can see that &ldquo;talus&rdquo; might best be translated as &ldquo;neck&rdquo; (or &ldquo;beard&rdquo;) while
the &ldquo;shoulder&rdquo; is not really produced by the punch; it&rsquo;s nice to consider how
the talus of the punch gets &ldquo;inverted&rdquo; by being &ldquo;subtracted&rdquo; from the matrix,
essentially maintaining its shape*** but it might very well be that Moxon&rsquo;s
&ldquo;talus&rdquo; could not have meant what we&rsquo;re talking about&hellip; On the other hand,
since &ldquo;talus&rdquo; no longer has a meaning in digital type, and we remain without
a good term for the internal blank space, I personally have no problem mildly
repurposing it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not that I value terminological pedantry; in fact
in cases like this I&rsquo;m quite liable to cut &amp; run and
use whatever term makes the most sense to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>** <a href="http://typophile.com/node/91336">http://typophile.com/node/91336</a>
With the caveat that L &amp; G could be wrong (too).</p>
<p>*** Although, as I discovered when I visited
Jim Rimmer if the punch isn&rsquo;t properly hardened it
changes shape when struck! My &ldquo;J&rdquo; became italicized&hellip;
<a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/44243#comment-275135">http://www.typophile.com/node/44243#comment-275135</a></p>
<p>BTW Kent, do I remember correctly that we had a very similar talus/beard
discussion a while back? I think I agreed with you back then as well, but we
still did not arrive at a usable term - which to me is the whole point. I do like
your &ldquo;clearance&rdquo; though (even if it does not enjoy the classiness of &ldquo;talus&rdquo; :-).</p>
<p>On a side note:
It&rsquo;s very interesting to realize that -in the metal days- a talus* seems to
have been needed only because of the neck (basically you needed some
extra room from the face to the edge) while today the main reasons for
a talus are: following the metal precedents for expected size-on-body;
and accommodating cap accents, a character range no longer optional
in professional type design (while in the metal days those could simply**
be &ldquo;patched&rdquo; in, eating into the leading space, and only when needed,
depending on the language).</p>
<ul>
<li>Here I&rsquo;m using it in the/my digital-era sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>** Although not elegantly.</p>
<p>Don: I do remember Gerald teaching us about paper spaces - I might
have even used some once when feeling particularly picky! But those
were used between sorts, not between lines. BTW, something else he
taught me was to put -very thin- sheets of paper <!-- raw HTML omitted -->under<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the type to
elevate it slightly for a better impression*, for example when you have
a wide range of sizes in a single forme and the larger type needs a bit
of help looking sufficiently solid.</p>
<ul>
<li>To be clear, we&rsquo;re not talking about the gaudy
over-impression practiced by the majority of
contemporary letterpress printers.</li>

<p>FWIW, Updike’s illustration of type anatomy in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Printing Types<!-- raw HTML omitted --> shows a similar allocation of terms (although not so extensive as L &amp; G). As does the example in a 1924 “guide for printers, advertisers, and students of printing” that I have.</p>

<p>Yes, very likely. We’ve been around these blocks so many times. As Yogi Berra said, it’s like déjà vu all over again.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I alluded to above, in Linotype, I think you actually needed a tiny amount of shoulder above and below for technical reasons — having to do with good contact between matrix and the throat of the mold when casting a slug, I believe. But my understanding is somewhat conceptual, not experiential, and maybe it was prescribed just to accommodate any necessary slope.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James, thanks for the follow-up. It&rsquo;s quite nice to hear
that &ldquo;talus&rdquo; is a living term in punchcutting. I think it&rsquo;s
OK to judiciously shift the meaning of a term based on
context. And as you seem to imply it&rsquo;s a nice feeling to
facilitate a continuity in the craft of type design. So Kent,
although you might suspect I was never wavering, in fact
I was thinking of giving &ldquo;clearance&rdquo; a chance (by using it
in public for a while) but now this emotional angle makes
&ldquo;talus&rdquo; too strong, not least on a personal level: I&rsquo;m lucky to
have once been granted a private tour of the wonders of the
Imprimerie Nationale by Christian Paput, and I wouldn&rsquo;t
mind honoring him! But beyond that, it makes for a nice
story to tell when somebody asks where &ldquo;talus&rdquo; comes from.
So this particular piece of terminological butter is back in
the fridge, and it&rsquo;s getting harder by the minute.  :-)</p>

<p>corps (body) = talus de tête + oeil + talus de pied</p>
<p>Since the &ldquo;interline spacing&rdquo;* (here the &ldquo;14&rdquo; in &ldquo;11 on 14&rdquo;) is equal to body+leading, and since the &ldquo;talus&rdquo; are basically the slopes at the top and the bottom of the character in lead (where you can put ascenders and descenders, as is being said in the article), I must confess it is hard for me to equate &ldquo;talus&rdquo; with &ldquo;body+leading&rdquo;.</p>
<p>*(edit) Maybe I should have written &ldquo;baseline skip&rdquo; (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->TeX baselineskip<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) since it is the distance between two baselines, and not the distance between two lines of text of non zero width.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Bringshurst&rsquo;s remarks imply that if no added leading is interposed between lines, and the type is &ldquo;full on the body&rdquo;, then it would be possible for the ink of a descender to run into the ink of an ascender on the next line down.  So for full on the body type, either leading should be added, or typesetting must be done carefully to avoid connected ascenders/descenders, or you just live with such connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quineau&rsquo;s diagram displays a font that&rsquo;s not full on the body, since the &ldquo;vuide&rdquo; is present outside of the descenders/ascenders.</p>

<p>Michael Boyer&rsquo;s remark about TeX baselineskip clarifies something I&rsquo;d been wondering about from the beginning.  Therefore if I wanted to typeset 11 on 14 in LaTeX, I would set baselineskip to 14/11 = 1.2727 using 11 point type?</p>

<p>It’s a small detail from the plate made by G. Quineau for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Description des Arts et Métiers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in about 1696, showing the system of related type bodies invented by Sébastien Truchet for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->romain du roi<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The heading to the plate reads ‘Calibres de toutes les sortes et grandeurs de Lettres’, meaning something like ‘measurements of all type body sizes’. The detail, maybe the first time anyone ever tried to show such a thing, gives you a diagrammatic view of a single piece of type, showing the ‘œil’ or x-height of the letter, the length of an ascender and a descender, both of which, of equal length, are called the ‘queue’ or ‘tail’, and then, above and below the letter, a small ‘empty space’ or ‘vuide’ (modern French ‘vide’) which was left on the face of the cast type in order to stop the descenders from above hitting the ascenders rising from below.</p>
<p>Didn’t always work in practice, of course, because getting the right distance between the lines of type depended on having moulds that fitted the matrices correctly, but at least this was the idea. (The whole plate is shown on page 49 of the catalogue we made for the exhibition at Lyon in 2002, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Le romain du roi – la typographie au service de l’État.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Concerning TeX, it is easier to see on a 10 point grid; I will thus choose  10/12 for my example and the font I will take is Computer Modern with &ldquo;optical size&rdquo; 8pt (cmr8).  To get the 12 points between two consecutive baselines in TeX, we just write <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\baselineksip=12pt<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. To set the font at 10 points, we just write it (the result will thus be slightly darker than  usual, since we set at 10 points a font meant for 8 points). Here is the input.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I run pdftex on it and I get a pdf output that I now view with Acrobat. I added a grid with a darker line at every 10 points.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cmr8_5381.png]
We see that the distance between the baselines is indeed 12 points. As for the body, cmr8.pfb has an ascent of 750 and a descent of 250 with an em size of 1000. With 10 points, that gives an ascent of 7.5 points and a descent of 2.5 points.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michel, you put the &lsquo;talus de pied&rsquo; as the distance from the bottom of the A to the bottom of the type body. If so &lsquo;talus de pied&rsquo; will be different for an &ldquo;A&rdquo; and a &ldquo;g&rdquo;, and thus is not one fixed number for a font.</p>
<p>So &lsquo;talus&rsquo; as you interpret it isn&rsquo;t very clear for what Hrant wants to use it for. Also James Mosley above refers to talus as a characterizing a <em>punch</em> and not a piece of lead type, if I understand him rightly.</p>
<p>It is also not clear to me whether &lsquo;vide&rsquo; will be one number either, because often the lower case ascenders are taller than the caps.</p>
<p>As I said, all in all, I don&rsquo;t see the point of using traditional terminology that wasn&rsquo;t that clear in the first place. In digital fonts, what is clear and precise is that all fonts have a defined baseline and a defined &lsquo;em&rsquo;. And if the software allows you to do one em of vertical space between lines, the space from baseline to baseline on paper will physically be the point size specified by the software. In a specification such as 12/14 the first number is the scale of the em to be printed, and the second the distance between baselines, end of story.</p>
<p>It does make sense to speak of a design being &lsquo;small on the body&rsquo;, giving a general and imprecise indication of how it fits on the em. But if you want to be precise, then you have to specify ascenders, descenders, x-height, caps, overshoots, accents, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Bill, please forgive me for relentlessly chasing terms that happen to have survived from metal type into the different world that this thread is mostly concerned with. I won’t go on with it for ever. But I originally contributed because I was fascinated to find that traditional terms like Nelly Gable’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->talus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I hear her use when she cuts a punch in steel, are still in use. And yes – to answer your query – the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->talus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is indeed seen right through the process, from the punch and the matrix into the cast type, and it normally produces a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->vide<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that makes for a slight inter-linear spacing in metal type.</p>
<p>In traditional typefounding, in which the steel punch is struck into copper to make a matrix, the strike naturally has the same <!-- raw HTML omitted -->talus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or slope. Since the cast type has a sloping profile that exactly reflects the shape of the punch, it has a ‘space’ above and below the face which gives it the slight built-in leading which seems to be the subject of the current debate. (In many traditional designs, the tops of ascenders and capitals align, but admittedly many current designers have gone back to the reduced caps of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->De Aetna<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, etc., which provide some extra spacing between lines.) You can get rid of the slope in lead type if you want to by using a mould that puts the face at the edge of the body and rubbing away any surplus sloping metal from the casting. But that’s a chore that’s best avoided. As I said before, you do this laterally when casting letters like o to get them to fit well, but see what trouble Fournier made for himself – in the example I gave – by doing this clumsily in the vertical dimension.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James, I appreciate your delving into the historical technology—I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from you! My point was that in this era some but not all of the old terms are useful.</p>
<p>Also something is still not clear to me. If &lsquo;talus&rsquo; means &lsquo;slope&rsquo;, then that would naturally apply on the type itself only to the slope leading from the printing surface to the non-printing top of the piece of type. But there is often space between the bottom of that slope and the edge of the body of the type. The distance between the top of the face and the vertical sides would be the talus + the distance along the flat non-printing surface to the side of the body. And that would vary with the particular character. So I don&rsquo;t see a natural way to adopt the old terminology for <em>one</em> number characterizing the type face.</p>
