  body: Kind of silly for that to be set in a Windows Vista font when the soul of

  body: "I thought it was odd at first, too. But aside from it being a phrase beat
    to death this past year via way too many appearances in interior design shots,
    the Calibri seems to be a nice tweak (though likely not intentional).\r\n\r\nI'm
    guessing a file was sent to the local vinyl cutter and he just swapped it with
    a system font. ;o)"
