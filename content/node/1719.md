  body: How I do it is I copy the complete URL of the test drive <BR>and paste it
    after my &#92;newurl{ code, which I then complete. <BR>Then I replace any &#43;signs
    with either spaces or %20s. <BR>What did you do?

  body: I just replaced the plusses with spaces. <BR>This time I used %20 &#40;the
    good old escape&#40;&#41; function&#41;. Seems to have worked.
