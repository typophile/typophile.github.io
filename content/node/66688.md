  a definitive answer online.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: "With comma splices replacing line breaks, e.g.:\r\n\r\nGreg Yourp\r\n137
    Stiener St. Apt #3\r\nBoston MA 02134-5623\r\nUSA\r\n\r\nbecomes:\r\n\r\nGreg
    Yourp, 137 Stiener St. Apt #3, Boston, Mass., 02134-5623, U.S.A.\r\n\r\nNote that
    there are no commas in the city state zip line in the envelope format, in accordance
    with postal guidelines, but there are when an address is written as inline text.
    Older custom is to include them on envelopes and to use a longer abbreviation
    for the state. Guidelines were updated to make addresses more easily readable
    both for machine readers and human sorting machine operators.\r\n\r\n(Name and
    address are made up, but I think I got part of the ZIP code right)"

  body: "<em>Boston, Mass., 02134-5623, U.S.A.</em>\r\n\r\nMore properly, should be\r\n\r\nBoston,
    MA 02134-5623, USA\r\n\r\nThe \"oldstyle\" state abbreviations\u2014Mass., Penna.,
    Tex., etc.\u2014may be considered proper AP style, but they introduce unnecessary
    confusion into the postal address process. And, FWIW, to avoid confusion, using
    the middot or periodcentered characters with added space on either side is probably
    preferable, given that a comma is used in the city-state-zip segment."

  body: I've long ago abandoned the long state abbreviations too, but I still see
    them in print often enough.
