  body: "Thank you so much that part is sorted!!\r\n\r\ni have a few more questions
    for you!! of course if you can answer them, that would be wonderful!\r\n\r\nin
    QuickCut, it is saying that the type needs to be within the type area.  i have
    outlined the type and made sure they were within the trim marks.  why do you think
    it might still have the exclamation marks? \r\n\r\nin QuickCut,it also has a particular
    section needing print marks.  i have specified these marks in Indesign??? \r\n\r\nin
    QuickCut, ink weight: it says that 63.37% of an image exceeds 310%.  i have attemped
    to change the size of the photoshop file, by experimenting with tif files and
    jpg files and still this appears???\r\n\r\nin QuickCut, knock out black: it locates
    the section which needs to have the knock out black removed.  i went to the particular
    file and unchecked the knock out, and still the problem is there!!\r\n\r\noh this
    program is giving me grief!! \r\n"

  body: "Just warn you, i don't know a lot about quickcut. But i'll answer you questions
    a well as i can. most of them seem to be pdf and prepress related\r\nType area:
    This is may be defined as a safe area for type thats inside your trim. Have seen
    it before but can't remember where/when.\r\nPrint Marks: Dunno\r\nInk Weight:
    This means that you artwork has more than the total allowable ink on certain parts
    of an image. ie 100C 80M 90Y 60K, this can cause problems on the press. You need
    to do your RGB to CMYK conversion using the correct profile in photoshop.\r\nKnock
    Out (overprint): are you preflighting you files before putting them into quickcut?
    some pdf preflight software will automatically set black to overprint.  might
    want to also try some different ways to output your pdf. Generally the best method
    is to print to ps and then distill."
