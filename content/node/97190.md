body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am making the logo for the owner of a clothing agency targeted
  at the high-end fashion world. \r\n\r\nThe name is Antonio Vitelli, so I created
  a logo mark whee you can grasp the two initials. I wanted to have an extremely solid
  and versatile look and feel to it.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ?\r\n\r\nBy the way
  the version with text is about to come...\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think you need to resolve the different stroke widths, especially between
    the thins of each letter. But it is a good start.

  body: Bellissimo! Also agree with Luma, I would try playing around with the stroke
    widths to achieve a slightly more harmonious balance. Still very sexy though,
    congratulations.

    me know your opinion, \r\n\r\nThank you\r\n"

    of the company name logotype. It's not unique at all.\r\n\r\nStill very much like
    the concept of your mark :)"

    you tried placing the V off-centre slightly? I'm seeing an M. "
