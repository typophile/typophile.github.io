  body: Judging from the "I" and the "G", I'd say it looks awfully close to Monotype's
    Arial Monospaced (http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/ariala_monospaced_bold/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=36&sample_text=DESIGNER&ft=liga).
    The "D" has a bit more of an Adobe DIN Mittelschrift look to it but the letters
    above look pretty similar to the Monotype font.
