  peekin' through, it can only mean one thing . . . NEW FONTS from the Font Bros!\r\n\r\nFilmotype
  -  Filmotype Alice marks the beginnings of the casual handwritten script aesthetic.
  Introduced by Filmotype in the late 1950s, it perfectly captures the mid-century
  playfulness of hand lettering while providing comfortable readability. Check it
  out at: http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=FILM-ALIC\r\n\r\nStrikingly
  poised and almost as exotic as it sounds, Filmotype Zanzibar is among Filmotype's
  most amazing and beautiful formal scripts released. This hidden gem was released
  originally in the early 1950s has been meticulously redrawn from the original font
  filmstrips. Check it out at: http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=FILM-ZANZ\r\n\r\nFontalicious
  - We've just updated and re-released a nice handful of original Fontalicious fonts!
  These fonts have been updated, expanded, and generated in OpenType format for your
  pleasure. The new re-releases include: Baby Kruffy, Cheeseburger, Juice, Lounge
  Bait, Mandingo, and Superfly! Check 'em out at: http://www.fontbros.com/fontalicious.php\r\n\r\nHarold's
  Fonts - Diversion is a little amusement, all swirls and spirals. It was inspired
  by the handlettered logo of an Italian restaurant in Mexico. Could add a lot of
  whimsy if used carefully, might cause dizziness if overused. Check it out at: http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=HAFO-DIVE\r\n\r\nHavana
  Street - Ooze was inspired by original 1940s style Hollywood hand-lettered, movie
  poster-type and is sure to bring the ghosts and ghouls out of your computer for
  some spooky fun! Perfect for Halloween, haunted houses, or when you need that classic
  creepy look! Check it out at: http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=HAVA-OOZE\r\n\r\nSideshow
  - Toylab was originally created by talented illustrator and lettering artist Molly
  Z for ToyLab, an actual wacky workshop where kids invent new toys using old toy
  parts. The letterforms were designed to evoke play and fun and to be used in the
  most imaginative of ways! Check out this super fun and futuristic font at: http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=SIDE-TOYL\r\n\r\nAs
  always, we strive to bring the best display typefaces to your desktop so enjoy browsing
  our HUGE and expanding selection of display typfaces and let a friend know where
  you shop for the best fonts online! Font Bros or course!\r\n\r\nWarmly,\r\nMike

    so I thought I'd post it . . . We've been very busy adding brand new stuff and
    re-releases of some older works but I'm happy that the Filmotype faces continue
    to roll out!\r\n\r\nStuart"

  body: "Actually, I may be confusing folks with too many mailers :D\r\n\r\nTiffany
    posted the mailing I sent to everbody who's opted in to receive updates from the
    Filmotype mailing list which you can too sign up for at the Filmotype.com website
    . . .\r\n\r\nThe release I posted today was from the Font Bros mass mailing that
    went out on Friday which features all the releases Font Bros just added including
    the Filmotype fonts - To clear up any confusion, I am a co-owner of Font Bros
    and post these releases from time to time unless Paul Hunt beats me to it :D\r\n\r\nAnd
    finally, after a significant lag, I just sent off another mass mailing to all
    the folks who are subscribed to the Font Diner e-mail list which covers some of
    this news as well as other Font Diner news . . . I may post that later on as well
    but I don't want to wear out my welcome since I expect to send a Mr. Retro mass
    mailing later today as well announcing some new serigraphs :D\r\n\r\nOtherwise
    for clarification, Mark digitized Filmotype Zanzibar for Font Diner even though
    we release that library exclusively via Font Bros at this time . . . Keep your
    eye's sharply peeled for the news of Zanzibar on Mark's site as well as another
    font creator who digitized the Filmotype Allison font (I won't OUT him here)\r\n\r\nAnd
    Chris, your sentiment hasn't gone unnoticed . . . Font Diner is the reason I am
    able to do what I do these days so I'm paying much love to the Diner but the fruits
    of my labor won't be revealed till the Summer with a new Font Set although the
    website update was a significant undertaking and I'm currently in EULA land getting
    that upgraded for the masses . . .\r\n\r\nI'm also working on releasing some old
    classics that were among my earliest releases . . .\r\n\r\nStuart :D"
