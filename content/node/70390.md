body: Can anyone figure out this font's identity? I cannot tell if it's a slab serif
  or a Venetian serif due to the poor quality of the image. I was hoping someone else
  might recognize it by the unique "t". It seems familiar, but I cannot place it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LOGO_5095.png]
