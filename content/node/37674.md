  if anyone could recommend any texts on the subject for further reading.\r\n\r\nI've
  done the obvious (Bringhurst obviously - which is now like gold dust to get hold
  of and TYPO by Freidl, Ott & Stein) and a few others, but any general historical
  texts you could recommend would be fantastic.\r\n\r\nA nice simple Monday morning
  (boo!) question...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nSimon"

    a great list, but I'd be interested to see the list narrowed to the top 3 or top
    5, by user opinions."

    having a meal with Peter B. Willberg and picking his brain and I asked him for
    book design book suggestions and he said look for an author\u2014\"Tokay\"?\r\n\r\nI
    have a hard time with the German accent, so I thought I'd go home and figure it
    out but I've got zip so far. Anyone have any ideas?"

    what he was saying. I may pretend it was though so I can stop fussing with it.
