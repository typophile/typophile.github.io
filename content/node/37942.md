body: I am looking for book and articles on the subject of reading, legibility, readability,
  and comprehension, specific to signage. In particular, I am interested in knowing
  what materials have influenced some of the signage fonts out there. Does anyone
  have anything to recommend

  body: 'I second Wayfinding: People Signs Architecture by Arthur / Passini. (As far
    as I know, Romedi Passini coined the term "wayfinding".) Anyway, this book describes
    very well the kind of problems people have with navigation, and with signage,
    in a very human way. I could quibble with some of the typographic advice, but
    it''s still an enormously helpful book. In my experience though, the problem with
    wayfinding is getting other people (designers / architects) to agree with the
    more fundamental descriptions of human subjectivity. For literature about that,
    I would recommend The Design of Everyday Things, by Don Norman. Although not specifically
    about wayfinding, he writes about user interaction with designed objects in such
    a way that useful lessons can still be drawn. "Make the right thing easy to do,
    make the wrong thing difficult or impossible to do, make it easy to fix mistakes,
    give feedback" -- all principles which should apply to good wayfinding. In particular,
    the distictions he makes about long- and short-term memory, or knowledge in the
    head / knowledge in the world, are very useful to bear in mind when thinking and
    talking about how people understand signage and wayfinding. '

    a lot of research papers here (that's what he really needs); some discuss materials,
