  body: "I thought about this topic for a little while after it went by so quickly
    with only one suggested response. There may have been other threads in Typophile
    that brought this up, and I didn't want to start a new topic, but I wanted to
    pay a little homage to the lettering artists of pop culture.\r\n\r\nHaving spent
    many, many hours early in my career hand lettering headlines, and using lettering
    devices (Varigraph Headwriter, Leroy Pantograph) to create ads, I've always admired
    lettering artists who had such a facility and love for the craft. Many never created
    a \"typeface\" nor had to, since their task was focused on specific context, while
    type designers generally look towards broader context usage.\r\n\r\nWithout getting
    to deep into explanation, here are several links from the ridiculous to the sublime:
