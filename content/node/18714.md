  be the italic form of a hand-lettered font, or maybe this is the only form of the
  font. It reminds me of Marc Tassell's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=GF.117378.0.2&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Sepp+Leaf+Products&sampleSize=32\"

  of differences.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?  Thanks, \r\n\r\n- Mike"

  body: "You might be right Stephen. When I look at a printout of it, there <em>might</em>
    be slight variations in the only duplicate letters (e, p and c) in the sample.
    \ It's very close though.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
