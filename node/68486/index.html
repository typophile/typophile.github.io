  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I understand the logic behind the "Th" ligature, of course, and I've tried my best to get used to it, but frankly, I can't stand it. Not only is it typographically unidiomatic (so that it always looks a little like a mistake -- and indeed, people often say, "something's wrong with your printer!" when they see it), but it's also just ugly. In the "f" ligatures, the f's curve flows neatly into the following letter, but the rectilinear collision of T and h doesn't create a natural join: it usually looks like they've just been tightly tracked to overlap. The net effect for me is oddly runic, and I'd rather not have it in the books I'm setting.

Moreover, it's a PITA to work around: you have to do a find and replace and deal with any reflow that arises, which pretty much necessitates doing the F&R on a case-by-case basis. In a 250-page book, that's a whole lot of clicking the Change/Find button.

How do you work around this? Or am I the only one who hates this ligature?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">The 'Th' ligature in which font? It makes no sense to make a blanket claim about any ligature.

Just do a global search and replace which finds 'Th' and applies 'ligatures off' to it. In InDesign, you'd do this by putting 'Th' in the 'find what' field, leaving the 'change to' field blank, and setting the 'change format' options appropriately.

		<div class="commentbody">It's a designer decision, plain and simple. By and large, it's the choice of designer Robert Slimbach -- but to a great extent, Robert guides the style of Adobe Originals in general, so it has evolved into a common ligature for most/all of our fonts. If another Originals designer doesn't want it in their fonts, we don't put it in.

We have noted opinions, both for and against, ever since it first appeared (which I think was in the first Adobe OpenType fonts).

I agree that it's helpful to cite specific typeface designs, since its success (IMO) does vary depending on the design. On one hand, I'd say there is very little chance of it going away in Adobe fonts, since, like I said, it is Robert's preference. On the other hand, we are interested in customer feedback and do take note of it. Opinion is mixed; it is not universally despised by any means.

For InDesign users, one technique for turning it off: Make a GREP style that finds 'Th' and applies a character style with ligatures disabled.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When I was doing Hypatia Sans, nobody said "you must have a Th ligature" but I was happy to include it, and have it on by default. I'm very fond of the "Th" ligature, and I like seeing my name with it on. I totally understand that it's a matter of taste, however.

I agree that it's unfortunate that applications don't offer any global controls for turning on or off specific ligatures, but such is life. Search and replace works okay, though one must be careful to do it at the end of the typesetting process.

I thought everyone would know (and I think most did) that I meant the Adobe Originals faces, progenitors of this ligature: specifically Arno and the Garamonds. And I was also talking about standard, garden-variety text setting. Titling and lettering are a different ballgame.

Really the only solution is to allow ligatures to be chosen individually. Making "Th" discretionary isn't the answer, because those who do like to use it are unlikely to want a text full of "ct" or "st" ligatures. (Maybe there should be three categories: standard ligatures, controversial ones, and those that will only rarely be used. Better yet: let users define their own sets.)

I'm curious: What's the advantage of using GREP over a plain, case-sensitive search for "Th"? In my experience, using find and replace to apply a "no ligatures" character style globally doesn't work, because this replaces any previously applied character style, and that's a problem if "no ligs" style isn't based on the replaced one.

You can use find and replace to turn off ligatures as local formatting, but the wider set of the non-ligature combination can and will cause reflow if, like me, you make the avoidance of loose, gappy lines a priority.

The advantage is that you create it as part of a paragraph style, and the substitutions happen automatically. There's no need to worry about doing it as the very last step (and maybe forgetting to). You just set up a GREP style at the beginning, and forget about it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For those who still see Adobe's role in the propagation of the 'Th' ligature as some kind of evil plot to destroy the universe, I can tell an anecdote: During the development of Adobe Clean (Adobe's new corporate sans serif typeface), there was a joined Th ligature. Robert and I were discussing design details one day, and I said that I thought that letter pair might look better unjoined. Not long after that, he rolled out a revision without the ligature, and said he had tried it out and agreed that it looked better without it. (In fact, there is a ligature glyph, but it's virtually the same as the regular unjoined letter pair.)

Robert might very well have gotten feedback from others in the Type group; it's not like I have some fantastic history of telling him how to improve his designs. The point is that Robert listens to others, considers the options, and does what he thinks is right for the design -- just like many <em>many</em> other type designers out there.</div>

So the appropriate feature would be Discretionary Ligature:

<code> sub T i' by dotlessi.alt ; </code>

(dotlessi.alt being the same glyph as dotlessi, renamed.)

The trouble with putting that in the feature is that if someone selected it to get e.g. "ffi" ligature, they would also get the "Tı" ligature, which they might not be expecting.

But as with the Th ligature, it's a foundry peccadillo.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I wasn't aware of Th ligatures in normal printing faces. As noted, they may serve a purpose in script faces.

I know I once saw a manual <em>typewriter</em> with the letters "th" as a single character on one of the keys - if it was a superscript "th" for numbers, that might have made sense, but simply as a way to make typing quicker by saving a keystroke, I thought it was a horrible idea.

The "ct" and "st" ligatures are mannered items used for self-consciously antique faces. For a run-of-the-mill roman, they would not be appropriate. If Adobe is producing faces like Times Roman, Century Expanded, or even Garamond, with a "Th" ligature, I would be predisposed to think it a very bad idea, although I might change my mind when I actually see the ligature in question. (It doesn't even seem to be a necessary kerning combination, let alone a potential ligature.) But if it's just script faces, or fancy swash italic faces, that's different.

EDIT: Having seen it in Adobe Garamond on MyFonts, and in Franklin Gothic in this thread, I concur with the original poster's opinion. It is out of place in ordinary text faces, and should not be inflicted on people who might use it with word processing programs that don't provide the opportunity to turn it off.

It is a disaster from an aesthetic point of view, and I cannot but wonder what those responsible could have been thinking.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just curious. Everyone is talking about a letter pair, and not about words. I would have thought the original reason for the ligature is that what usually follows the Th (in English, anyway) is a lower-case letter, usually a vowel, frequently an "e." 

The problem is one of spacing. Easy enough to avoid spacing problems with T and h -- change the design of the "T", or change the spacing of the font. Oh. Consequences. T's with very short crossbars don't look quite right. The modern aesthetic is for tight spacing of letters.

I've seen any number of fonts where kerning with the capital T created a rather ugly blob. Admittedly, this is most common with the "i" as opposed to the "h", but you can find "h" examples too.

As with most problems, solutions involve compromises. I prefer the Th ligature to the "kern into an ugly blob" solution. The "let the extra space fall where it may" solution has proponents, and does make life easier -- editors, who often have the final say, won't mark it "P.E. touching" because it is a ligature. But this is offset by the query from designers (graphic designers) who write "Can't you do something about this?"

Compositors understand compromises, it's their business. A lonely business, it seems . . .

Edit:

It just occurred to me, If you do Nick's last name with a lowercase double-n ligature, it becomes "Shim." Just what you need when things are a bit too loose . . . </div>
