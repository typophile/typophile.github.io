  body: "I don't mean to be rude but please read the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forums/typeid/faq/#Q_2\">FAQ
    of the Type ID Board</a> regarding thread titles. Having \"ID This Font\" as the
    title is not inviting. :)\r\n\r\nAs for the ID. At first glance, it looks custom
    but I can't be certain. "

  body: Also, cropping is a great tool.  It gets rid off all that empty white space
    around your image when you scan something.
