  and I'm hoping you might be able tell me the name of the font in the attached image.
  It can also be seen on [[http://www.thetravellingreptileshow.com|this website]].
  I have taken over work on the site and some of the buttons and images need to be
  changed, but the former owner did not send along a font file for me to use, so your
  help in identifying this would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/home-birthdayinvites-title_4059.gif]"

  body: "Little hint 1: Sending fonts is illegal, even if you work for the client.
    \r\nLittle hint 2: If you have an existing PDF with the font in it, you can read
    the name out at \xBBpage-properties\xAB or so. If you are on a mac, press command+D
    (On Win it will probably be CTRL+D). "

  body: "Thank you, Renko. I do have an existing PDF with the font in it but I had
    no idea I could find the name of it there. I'm an amateur web designer at best.
    Also thank you for the tips. I was under the impression that if the font was bought
    and paid for by you it would be alright to give it to someone else, but I guess
    I was mistaken.\r\n\r\nYour help and advice is appreciated!"
