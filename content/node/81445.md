  typeface with the black outline that has the cross hatching beneath it. Any recommendations
  for similar fonts would also be appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "I think this is custom lettering, but my suggestions for alternatives would
    be the heaviest weights of one of the following: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-newtext-2/\">ITC
    Newtext</a>; <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/alexon-rr/\">Alexon</a>;
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-symbol/\">ITC Symbol</a>; or
    Nick Shinn's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort-pro/\">Beaufort
    Pro</a>.\r\n\r\nYou would need to layer gray copies of the lettering to make the
    shadow effect.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
