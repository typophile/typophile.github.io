  body: Seems to me you're distancing form from meaning. Icons are for us to recognize
    and distinguish easily from one another. So it may be good to click a shipping
    van for a shipping company, but that is lost if it's among a lot of other vans
    that have nothing to do with the subject. There's no metaphor, just the obscuring
    of more effective symbols by skewing them nearly out of view or making one big
    thing into four smaller things.

  body: "@cerulean i think, There are some metaphors,\r\n\r\n- Social network websites
    are a kind of transportation platform for today's information (person to person)\r\n-
    If there is no official van design for any of them, it is very fun to view/show
    it.\r\n- Social Network websites are also like today's collection boxes. We are
    storing billion of things from our life or our obsessions. \r\n- And i love to
    make extraordinary icons...\r\nhttp://www.a2591.com/2008/12/new-year-gift-container-icon-set-2.html\r\nhttp://antrepo4.com/image/iconfull.jpg"
