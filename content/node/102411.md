body: "Hello guys, could you please help me identify these two sans fonts? First in
  \"MARKET\" and then in \"Pila Lidecko\".\r\n\r\nThese are parts of a logotype for
  a local groceries in Southern Moravia for which an unknown designer used these two
  fonts to easily define their basic CID elements.\r\n\r\nI am supposed to work with
  it further but am unable to define these fonts using both my knowledge and known
  online sources (what-the-font etc.).\r\n\r\nThank you very much for you time and
  effort. Greatly appreciated in advance :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/market_4204.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pila_6057.jpg]"

    two images are using the same font, with MARKET squooshed. '

  body: "Exactly. It looks very familiar both to me and my colleague but we still
    can't place it. We are pretty sure that the font in Pila Lidecko isn't modified
    in any way (except kerning maybe) and it's not Max Black (thank you fvilanakis
    anyway! :-)). \r\n\r\nIt is also possible that the font is the same in both signs
    (Market / Pila...) and could be either an extended / regular version of the same
    typeface or simply squooshed as you said."

  body: Not sure if it's useful, but it made me think of Neo Sans, Akko, Cachet, Klavika
    and Klint. I think it could be modified/custom. The ascenders are longer than
    usual for this type of design, and the /e/ and /k/ look a bit wide perhaps.

  body: Concord Bold, Tahoma Bold or even Verdana are close for Market - it does appear
    squooshed. Just to point out how tricky this is.

  body: "Thank you guys. The top font can probably be found among those you suggested.
    The tricky one is in \"Pila Lidecko\". Still can't figure that out using even
    more forums like this one... \r\n\r\nI honestly did not think that I could be
    deceived so much after so many years in business. :-)"
