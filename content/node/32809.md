body: "I'm making an OpenType handwriting font for a client, so all characters have
  long lead-out strokes to flow nicely into the next character. However, the client
  doesn't want these long strokes at the end of every word. So I'm wondering how I
  can replace the regular characters (eg. y) by end characters (eg. y_end), so in
  the word 'every' only the y would change. I've looked through the needle-in-a-haystack
  manual with no luck. How does one specify just the last letter of each word to change
  to an alternate form?\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated."

    the solution that i've linked to does is replace every letter with the final form
    <em>unless</em> it is followed by a letter: in these instances, the substitution
    rule is ignored. i think this is a better solution, because the ending forms are
    determined by the word boundary and not by the presence or absence of the space
    character."

  body: "Note that the 'fina' feature is on by default and in some applications may
    be impossible to turn off, so you only want to use it if the substitutions should
    always happen. 'fina' feature support presumes character level analysis by the
    layout engine, so you don't need any context for it. The layout engine identifies
    the circumstances in which the substitution should occur and applies the feature.\r\n\r\nIf
    using the 'calt' feature, I second Paul's suggestion to use the ignore syntax
    or, in VOLT, the EXCEPT syntax:\r\n\r\n f -> f.terminal\r\n EXCEPT |<any letter>\r\n"
