body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Ligature</strong>\r\n\r\nThe connecting
  link between two letters that are joined together. Also, two or more characters
  that are combined into one [[glyph]], generally comprising such characters as <strong>\uFB01</strong>,
  <strong>\uFB02</strong>, <strong>\uFB00</strong>, <strong>\uFB03</strong>, <strong>\uFB04</strong>
  etc.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nWhen type was made of metal, ligatures were a physical necessity
  to stop one piece of metal clashing with another: it was physically impossible for
  strokes to overlap. Not so with digital strokes: so nowadays, ligatures have primarily
  aesthetic benefits. Some ligatures, such as the common <strong>\uFB01</strong> may
  merely prevent the collision of two glyphs, but others such as the OO ligature provide
  a decorative, ornamental quality.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/19376\">qu
