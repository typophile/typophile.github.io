  body: "I did some searching for the numerals and found nothing that I thought would
    be close enough for your project, if you really want to replicate the lettering.
    Huxley Vertical was quite similar, but not identical. The 4 was open and the 8
    was more symmetrical. Agency Gothic is too angular. Raleigh Gothic is also fairly
    close, but the 1 has serifs, and at least the metal type version was heavier weight.
    Eden Light was a serif typeface, but its numerals show few serifs, and might be
    a possibility for you. Eden has been digitized, as have the others I mentioned.
    Maybe with a bit of tweaking you could make one of these work.\r\n\r\nThe basic
    sans lettering should be fairly easy to replicate, so i didn't focus on that one.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks Mike! You really looked into this and I appreciate your help. I think
    Eden Light is the way to go, unless something else comes along that looks better.
    Shouldn't take too much tweaking to get it right. \r\n\r\nI agree about the sans
    lettering. Most of it looks to be Futura Bold (with the possible exception of
    the words at the very top). \r\n\r\nIf you're interested, you can follow my progress
    on this project on Dribbble: \r\n\r\nhttp://dribbble.com/studio1126/projects/27386-1938-Zenith-12S2672-Radio-Dial\r\n\r\nThanks
