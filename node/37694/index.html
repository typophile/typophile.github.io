  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, I spend much time reading the great articles here, but usually feel hesitant to post.

However, I now own a few of the more common commercial fonts, and one of the more challenging aspects I have to face at the outset of a project is pairing up a body and headline/titling face.

To date I tend to stick to using a single typeface for both, mainly due to the limited number of fonts I can afford as a freelancer. However, things are moving onm and I would like to find something to pair up with Cronos, Dax, and the much maligned Myriad Pro... Most of my projects are flyers, small brochures, and booklets.

I would be grateful for anyone's suggestions of pairings that work for them, and some pairings that look plain awful in the eyes of the typogurus...

Thanks

		<div class="commentbody">I feel in general most pairings depend on the theme or subject of the work. 

When I think about matching fonts I try and picture a contrast (like a body copy font mixed with an italic display) but keep in mind the design aesthetics. Maybe the same designer, x-height, time period etc.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The fontshop article on type systems is very useful as a guideline - thanks.

I agree, it's usually important (for most clients) to select faces which compliment each other in a way that does not subtract the impact that each face has in it's own setting. I guess it comes down to my own confidence in choosing two faces to work together... 

Having said that, some of the ideas my clients come to me with are pretty horrific (a most recent leaflet had to be set with comic sans headlines and arial body type, despite my protestations - this required a long walk with the dog to the top of a local hillside and an equally long time staring at the setting sun meditating on why the hell I want to be a designer) so I doubt I'll go that far wrong!

I use Dax quite a bit for short runs of body text, and would like to use Cronos with it, but I'm not sure if Cronos is too Sans to get away with it, although the x-height and basic underlying shape wildly different.

It's obviously one of those areas that are open to more subjective thought than I first imagined :)</div>
