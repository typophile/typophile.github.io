  represent april fools.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aprilfools_5636.png]

  body: "Yes\r\n\r\nBut to what purpose?  Also, is the barcode faux or real? It looks
    like it must be faix. Can you embed a meaning in it too? What about switch the
    letters for numbers like 3 for E etc?"

  body: "5L00F L1RP4\r\n\r\n$L00F L1RP4\r\n\r\nWhat is 7 used as in letter form? Is
    it L but the other way round?\r\n\r\nI wish there was an E so it could be replaced
    by a \xA3.\r\nAlso, it is the first day of the financial yr int he UK, therefore
    it could work with that too i.e. buying etc\r\n\r\nIt is for my book. Please see
