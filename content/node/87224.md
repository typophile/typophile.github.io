  of a subjective question, I'd just like your opinion. I'd also like it as an idea
  for one of my own fonts.\r\nRight now I use Minion, Calluna, or Fontin for writing
  papers, but I wouldn't call them the fanciest fonts I know of. So far I think the
  fanciest one I've seen is Espinosa Nova.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\ntruth14ful"

    of hard without knowing what you would use it for, but I'd add Centaur, Brioso,
    and Yana. Arno and Adobe Jenson would also have been high on my list."

  body: "Interesting, as fancy could mean in a way \"done in an elaborate way\", or
    as well \"having a flair of luxury\".\r\nFor the first category the typeface would
    need to be rich in details, for the second it needs to have a certain feel to
    it. So of the sake of discussion I think you need to clarify <em>your</em> definition
    of fancy. \r\n\r\nWhile for example Jenson does have a lot of details, for some
    of a general public Bodoni in bold and all caps might read \"fancy\", as we know
    it from the Vogue cover. \r\n\r\nTo answer with my personal feel, I consider Cycles,
    by Sumner Stone, as fancy. Following that are Andron, Arno, Williams Caslon,  Dante
    and Sabon. Interesting enough, they are old old style fonts, but I guess that
    is my thing. However I am not in a type/graphic profession."

    new Caturrita is nice."

  body: "I wouldn't use the term 'fancy' to characterize Centaur. 'Fancy' connotes,
    at least for me, ornament or excess. There's great attention to form in Centaur
    - which happens to be old-style form -, as there is also in Optima, Frutiger,
    Futura, Gill Sans, Hans Eduard Meier's faces, etc., etc. The design of Centaur
    is in its way, spare - it has a sufficiency, not a superfluity.\r\n\r\nYou might
    call Brioso fancy, though, or at least busy (in comparison, Centaur is stately).
    Ditto for Arno."

  body: IMAO, not much can beat a well-drawn garalde on elegance. Both at the same
    time... reckon I'll nominate a Kanzley Fraktur. There's one (at least) in the

    collection]] on the [[http://moorstation.org/typoasis/typoasis1.htm|typOasis]].
