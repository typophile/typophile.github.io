    than your verticals. \r\n\r\nYour counters also look like they need expanding.
    It doesn't look like they sit on the base line, or touch the cap height.\r\n\r\nI
    also seem to be getting alot of weird problems, at different sizes. Looks like
    you haven't connected your strokes, they're over shooting, on most of the characters.
    Can be done in fontlab, so not really an issue. \r\n\r\nHope it helps.\r\n"

  body: "Fixed the weird problems, it was 'filler' shapes that I had not merged with
    the rest of the letter. I just have a bunch of expanded strokes for a quick preview
    in Illustrator. I'm trying to start drawing in FontLab but I usually doodle with
    Illustrator at work, as I'm much more comfortable with it for the moment. I plan
    on plumping up the verticals a bit as I draw this in FontLab, as well as overshooting
    the counters.\r\n\r\nThe Y & K are two of my favorites as well, the 'K' being
    why I think the face is kind of silly. I'm struggling with a few characters, particularly
    the D. I can't seem to get it to fit in, the one you see is my best attempt. My
    'S' is weird, and try though I might, it either ends up looking deformed or leaning
    severely.\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback."

  body: "I like it overall.  Directions for improvement:\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem
    is that round shapes are not taller than square ones. In other words, the O should
    extend slightly above and slightly below the top and the bottom of the E. Otherwise
    the round shapes will look too small. \r\n\r\nYou could invert the height of the
    center horizontals in some letters - for instance, have the horizontal of the
    A, and the join in the Y, and the depth of the center point in the M, closer to
    the bottom.  The horizontal in the R is correctly lower than the other letters,
    but it's close enough to the others that it looks like it might be an accident.
    \r\n\r\nYou could play with miter joins as well as round joins. I'd consider the
    M and N with miter joins, or B, D, and E with round joins at the bottom and miter
    joins at the top.\r\n\r\nThe tail on the Q looks like it was copied and pasted
    from part of another letter.  Give it some personality. \r\n\r\nI like the S like
    it is.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n-matt"

    then I'd vote against that.

  body: "I think that thick 'I' is just a rendering glitch in Acrobat.\r\nConstruction
    wise, I think you need to optically correct your 'X'. The lines shift optically
    when they cross, you might want to shift the top right arm a couple of units down
    diagonally (along the lower right leg of course).\r\n\r\nAw, that is a horrible
    explanation on my side. My English is not too good at this moment. :)"

    what you mean, and that explains why I couldn't get my X to look right. Will definitely
    heed your advice as I revise.\r\n\r\nMatt, I've taken all of your ideas into consideration
    and have already made several modifications you've suggested, all of which were
    to my liking. Since I am just working with stroked lines in Illustrator right
    now, I've chosen to forego thickening my verticals (or slimming the horizontals)
    until I move to FontLab. I plan on keeping that to a minimum, as I like the mono-line-width
    look of the font.\r\n\r\nWill post a revised PDF later tonight. Thanks for the
    critiques."

    many of the suggestions, but still have some issues. The N, M and W look much
    better to me now but don't seem to fit in much anymore in some circumstances.
    The D has been revised but is still awful. I want to evoke some of that A angle
    but nothing seems to be working. The double S's also seem troublesome.\r\n\r\nYour
    thoughts are appreciated.\r\n\r\nedit: @quincunx thanks for the illustration,

  body: "Good, I'm glad it was clear. My English isn't too bad, but it was late at
    night, and when I'm tired my English suddenly worsens badly. ;)\r\n\r\nI think
    optical the correction on the X works fine. It's hardly noticable, which is the
    way it should be. But that's stating the obvious.\r\n\r\nOne detail that stands
    out at the moment, is that some characters have rounded corners, some have rounded
    and sharp corners, and some only have sharp corners. It doesn't <em>really</em>
    bother me, but it does stick out a bit here and there.\r\n\r\nAbout the S, what
    if you make the top terminal extend a bit more to the right? It does seem a bit
    heavy on the left. Also it looks like the spine is thinner then the two hooks
    (what are those things called anyway, they're not bowls or shoulders, but I digress)
    which may be imbalancing the shape a bit, since the weight is usually placed on
    the spine. Eventhough contrast is pretty much non existent in your typeface, it
    might help if you move the weight that exists to the spine. Also the bottom terminal
    is very different from all the other terminals, as that one flares out wider (which
    the 3 and the 5 don't do, eventhough the shapes are somewhat similar).\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure about the tail of the Q. It looks pleasingly peculiar, but it doesn't
    really seem to belong. And it is it me, or is the 'V' awfully narrow?\r\n\r\nKeep
    it up."

    to try to help bring the letterforms together and really liked it so I went all
    out. It's finally in FontLab now as well, though I'm still not sure enough of
    my characters to start kerning.\r\n\r\nMade a lot of changes; some may be good,
    others may be awful. Let me know!\r\n\r\nAlso, I ditched my numbers and am going
    to make them once I've finalized my letters (or gotten close enough). I started
    on some punctuation, will post more of it later.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about a lower
    case, but when I tried before I didn't get far. Any tips?"

    too high. The same goes for the F. Especially the F, because there is a lot of
    white space below the bottom crossbar.\r\n\r\nAbout the lower case, how about
    posting those try-out sketches, so people can give you tips from there."

  body: I played with the lower case all weekend, posted another revised PDF with
    lotso-changes and my attempt at old style numerals, though I hate what I ended
    up with. I'm real iffy on the lower case, and I also revised the capital A even
    though that was 90% of the distinction of the font. It just stuck out way too
    much so this new one is based much more on the 'V'.

  body: "I think those are nice lowecase sketches. Somehow I feel that the ascenders
    and descenders are a bit long. It's most apparent in the 'g' and 'y'. But making
    them shorter is also problematic, because usually the ascenders and descenders
    are longer than the capitals. So the 'g' and 'y' might also be caused by the shape
    of the characters. And I notice that the top of the 'y' overshoots, which does
    stick out a bit.\r\n\r\nI like the lowercase 'w' and 'v' alot. The 'x' seems to
    be too narrow. On the 'd p q' (and maybe the 'a' as well), the place where the
    bowl joins with the stem, the triangular 'gap' on the short terminal looks a bit
    crammed. Look at your 'u', that looks better in my opinion, more white space is
    left. The 'e' is placed too low; the bottom overshoot is too large. Maybe you
    can also check how the 'e' looks if the crossbar is placed slightly lower. I'm
    not a big fan of the 'r', it might be too wide. And maybe try to make the lowercase
    'L' more different from the capital 'i'. Or it might get confusing if you have
    those characters in one word, like 'Illustrator'."

    all-caps with stylistic alternatives). The lower case changed everything.\r\n\r\nQuin,
    I'm definitely taking your advice into account as I sit down to do another batch
    of changes. I wonder, though, if there are any capital letter that look too narrow
    or too wide, as well? The problem I was having with my lower case is that the
    letters are more uniform when it comes to their width, and the upper case varies
    a great deal. What think ye?"

  body: I'm going to fish with a specific question... as I open this, besides some
    of the overall flaws in the letterforms, the big thing I notice is how narrow
    the upper case is. I liked the condensed look when I started (it was all caps
    then), but I really like my lower case and its basic form; this is probably because
    it's the first lower case I've ever really drawn and am pleased with it's seeming
    congruity. I'm thinking of tossing most of my upper case and starting over. Does
    anyone care to talk me out of it? ;)
