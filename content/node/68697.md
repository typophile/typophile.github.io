body: "Hi, I just bought a box of old leady type from a small print shop. It's a display
  sized Black Letter family. There seem to be mixed pieces of 72 and 60 pt in the
  box.\r\n\r\n\xBFAny idea on how to clean this? Most of the dirtiness is dust but
  there are also some rusted pieces.\r\n\r\nTIA[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_9543_4689.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_9544_6371.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_9547_4227.JPG]"

  body: Better to polish the corrosion off by laying down a sheet of emery cloth (1000
    or finer grit) on a hard, flat surface and using gentle, orbital motions...

  body: "Don't use anything hard to rub it. There are some leather pads, you can buy
    in any supermarket for cleaning plates and whatever. Its useful. On the oder hand:
    You don't want to print with it anymore, do you? So you can use harder solutions,
    too.\r\n\r\nYou might see the round marks on the side of the types? This are \"Gussmarken\"
    - I don't know the english word. This is one from Schelter & Giesecke:\r\nhttp://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=58&idart=826\r\n\r\nYour
    american types should have an height of 23,32 mm. German height is at 23,56 mm.\r\n\r\nIf
    you need any more types, use: ;-)\r\nhttp://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=69&article_id=670\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
