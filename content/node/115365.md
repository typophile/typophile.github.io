    patterned letters used on websites, such as this one http://www.clipartof.com/interior_wall_decor/details/Font-Set-Of-Blue-Starry-Patterned-Letters-Numbers-And-Punctuation-Poster-Art-Print-31589
    which has a similar starry pattern, but placed on different letter-forms. Also

  body: It looks like the same pattern of stars pasted over the outline letters -
    notice how some land outside the lines. makes me think it is not a font but more
    a combine technique.

  body: "According to the copyright note in the font, this is \"Sans Poster Bold JL\"
    reworked with a starry effect. My initial impression is that \"Sans Poster Bold
    JL\" is not a rip of another font-maker's work. So here is a link to \"Starlight
    Sans JL\" http://www.fonts2u.com/starlight-sans-jl.font\r\nNote that Jeff Levine's
    website, \"Jeff's Fonts & Dingbats\" has expired.\r\nDon"
