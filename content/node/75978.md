body: I'm developing a logo and website for a non-profit and have been wanting to,
  but at the same time fighting against using Museo. On one hand the typeface is perfect
  for the organization, works seamlessly with the mark I've developed, there is a
  free version, etc. On the other hand it has been used soo much and I'm concerned
  that it will in some way cheapen what I'm doing by making it too trendy. What do
  you think? Is a Museo site and logo destined to become dated in a few years (or
  even now?) I've looked into alternatives like Midiet, Colaborate, Aaux, Profile,
  Amasis, and a bunch others but none of them are working for me as well as Museo.
  I'd appreciate any input you guys have to offer!
