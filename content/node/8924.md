  The new Blake Hotel &#40;formerly the Hyatt Printer&#39;s Row, which is being transformed
  into a condo hotel&#41; was going to be called the Morton Hotel, but Morton&#39;s
  restaurant objected.  <BR> <BR>So the Falor Corp. decided to name it after the Blake
  type font, which a local weekly described as &#34;commonly used by newspapers and
  was invented in a 19th century British printing house&#34; .... the naming is &#34;to
  pay homage to the industrial past of Printer&#39;s Row.&#34;

  body: Cool, now I know where to stay in Chicago. <BR>BTW, I don&#39;t know of a
    <i>font</i> named blake, but maybe it&#39;s referring to James Blake, the money-man
    of the famed Stephenson Blake foundry? Although that was a British operation...
