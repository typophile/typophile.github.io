  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>That is, how to specifically to learn about typography, typographic design (of documents, web sites, books, magazines).</p>
<p>I know that the question is a broad one and that one of the answers would be: to get a degree in graphic design or something similar. I have a fair share of degrees and at the moment that really wouldn&rsquo;t be feasible.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m looking for advice from both professional designers (those who have a degree in the filed and those who don&rsquo;t but are professionally active in the field) and people for whom this is a hobby or something not really done on professional level.</p>
<p>I guess it would include books, suggestions of beautifully designed logos, books, documents, websites&hellip; and basically ANYTHING you&rsquo;d have to say on topic. Things from basic properties of typefaces (x-height, whether it&rsquo;s a &lsquo;modern font&rsquo;, kerning) to paragraph design, line spacing, page margins, how to choose the font based on material&hellip; to anything and everything &lsquo;advanced&rsquo; and &lsquo;expert&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If you attended a school or a course in this type of design, I&rsquo;d like to know how it helped you and what would you say are some valuable things you&rsquo;ve learned while there.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Questions like &ldquo;how to choose the font based on material&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t answered (effectively) in any book. That comes from experience, and a general/overall education in design. Reading books on your own will not make you a better designer. You may learn some of the rights &amp; wrongs, but that&rsquo;s easy. Immersing yourself in a world of design where you go to class and critique and see other&rsquo;s work and have a chance to critique that and you&rsquo;re forced to do projects and certain subjects/categories of design etc. is something you can&rsquo;t (easily) do on your own.</p>
<p>Bringhurst&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Elements of Typographic Style&rdquo; is a good place to start, in terms of typography. Muller-Brockmann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grid Systems in Graphic Design.&rdquo; Samara&rsquo;s &ldquo;Making and Breaking the Grid: A Graphic Design Layout Workshop.&rdquo; Meggs&rsquo;s &ldquo;A History of Graphic Design.&rdquo; Just a couple good ones.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re thinking of becoming a professional designer, or just want to learn more. If you&rsquo;re thinking professional, keep in mind that graphic design is communication problem-solving, and typography is just one element in that process. There&rsquo;s much more to learn, including design theory, design history, color theory, photography, illustration, printing, business practices, all the various computer programs you need to learn, and on and on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to discourage you, and typography is indeed very important, but typography is just one of many things that designers need to learn.</p>

<p>As JamesM says, &ldquo;graphic design&rdquo; has become such a widely reaching profession, it&rsquo;s difficult to just jump in. Web design (html php css javascript actionscript sql asp), packaging (and all the things that entails&hellip;), printing technologies (litho, digital, offset, digital offset, etc.), photography, all the things he mentioned. Mastery of these things are what make a good designer, and they&rsquo;re things best learned in a school environment (in my opinion.)</p>
