body: In [[http://typophile.com/node/54972|another thread]], James Mosley notes with
  respect to [[Cheltenham]] that "the type that resulted is a long way from the lively
  original sketches by Goodhue". I'd love to see those sketches. Are they available
  anywhere?

    why ATF and Linotype toned it down so much. This might work on greeting cards,
    or as a titling face (with alternate figures to keep it from getting too wonky)
    but as a text face it would be incredible irritating. "

  body: "Dwiggins was a great admirer of Cheltenham (having selected it for his subject
    when asked by the Eastern Paper Company to create a broadsheet specimen of his
    choice for them).\r\n\r\nAt one point, he toyed with his own design inspired by
    and based on some of the Cheltenham proportions and characteristics. In the end
    it came to nothing.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this short-lived experiment, C.H.
    Griffith sent to WAD a package with this note: \"For such interest as it may have,
    I am enclosing a photostat reproduction of the original Goodhue drawings of Cheltenham.
    These drawings were subsequently modified by Morris Benton, resulting in the present
    Cheltenham Old Style letter. Benton's drawings were used for our cutting.\"\r\n\r\nTo
    this Dwiggins replied: \"The Goodhue drawing most interesting -- shows that he
    was a better architect than he was type-designer.\"\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"

    Is the image above from a drawing or is that the Cheltenham press version? The
    Linotype version is very similar to the ATF version, so it could be that both
    versions descended from the final metal weights by Goodhue. Of course ATF and
    Linotype could have been cross licensing from each other, it\u2019s not like anybody
    kept records of that stuff\u2026"

    created at the stage of large-scale drawing for big type.\r\nAt the time, that
    would have been for foundry type, as hot metal didn't go large enough to warrant
    that subtle an attention to detail."

    (probably while you were posting), Mergenthaler Linotype used Benton's drawings
    for their version.

    among the a's, e's, and other repeating letters. Notice how some of the e's are
    closed and some are open (as in the final Cheltenham Old Style Italic).\r\n\r\nI
    think it's interesting that he uses \"font\" and \"type\" interchangeably."

  body: 'Nick -- I''m not sure why you''re referring to Benton''s cleaned up and regularized
    Cheltenham as a "slab serif," or even a "toned-down" slab (as James qualified
    it). The original ATF Cheltenham shows, for the most part, rather thick, stubby,
    and heavily bracketed serifs. Not quite as filled-in on the hard stock of the
    1923 catalog as the somewhat fuzzy reproduction that Mark posted, but still, not
    what I would call slab. '

    a low-contrast face with thick serifs, so that's what makes it a slab, IMO. The
    roundedness of the brackets is so slight at text size, given the stubbiness of
    the serifs, as to not be much of a feature. However, the novel \"s\" shape of
    the bracket is quite distinctive at display size."

  body: "Okay, Nick. I suppose it's a matter of semantics. I consider the Cheltenham
    serifs more of a Clarendon structure -- bracketed, low-constrast, squarish ending.
    I suppose some consider Clarendon a slab-serif. But for me it doesn't become slab
    until there's no bracketing.\r\n\r\nI'm not contesting the essence of your point;
    clearly Benton shifted the design toward a low-contrast finish even while trying
    to maintain Goodhue's underlying letterforms.\r\n\r\nI think it's a little misleading,
    though, to compare the later Cheltenham family additions as the Benton characteristics
    became more pronounced as the family developed, especially in heavier wider styles.
    \r\n\r\nI think the original Oldstyle actually retains a fair amount of Goodhue's
    quaintness.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ATFCheltOS_3619.gif]"
