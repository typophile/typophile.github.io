body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to take the book Grid Systems and learn Joseph M\xFCller-Brockmann\u2019s
  approach to setting up a functional grid but I am having some troubles with his
  examples and was hoping someone could shed some light on what it is I am not understanding.\r\n\r\n1.
  When I look at his examples in the book or any of his work the head line, body copy
  and captions all line up to my eye from the same baseline. Is this correct?\r\n\r\n2.
  In his examples he writes things like 20 pt head on 4 pt lead. Would this be 20
  pt font size and 24 pt leading in my inDesign type pallet? I know this is a stupid
  question but when I set up three text blocks side by side in inDesign it doesn\u2019t
  look like his examples.\r\n\r\nFor example he says 20 pt head on 4 pt lead(20pt
  on 24pt) with body copy set at 10 pt with 2 pt lead(10pt on 12pt) and captions set
  at 7 pt on 1 pt lead(7pt on 8pt) and then nothing lines up.\r\n\r\n3. I have my
  text box set at Cap Height since he says your first line of type should fit in the
  grid at the cap height. Is this wrong?\r\n\r\n4. In his examples he has his breaks
  for the vertical spacing margins starting the top margin line at the base of the
  descender in the above line and then the bottom margin line at the Cap Height of
  the line below. Is there a formula for figuring out the height to the break?\r\n\r\n5.
  Am I just not understanding how to set things up in inDesign.\r\n\r\nI think it
  would be fun to understand how his grids work as I really am attracted to everything
  Joseph M\xFCller-Brockmann has done. Can someone please help me out with understanding
  how to work this out.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your time and help.\r\n\r\nMark"
