body: "Here is a book about wood that i found. (well i found it at a friends house
  but they didnt really care so i took it) \r\n\r\nits pretty interesting if not a
  little bit sloppy in the way it has been set. Well maybe not sloppy but there are
  better type set books.\r\n\r\nMy question is this. At the foot of some of the pages
  there is a number (4,604) just to the left of the page number with a letter (from
  B to M) on the right on the page number. I think they are section markers and the
  number i can only guess is a word count. Is this right and if it is why is it there.
  was this a visual note to the book maker?\r\n\r\nanyway hope this makes sense and
  if not just have a look at the book. its alright.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nP\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/book23_6474.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/COVER006_4940.jpg]"

  body: "Does this book have 22 roman-numbered pages before the page numbered \"1\"?\r\n\r\nAs
    for the \"word count\", nah, I don't think so, at least not for a single page.
    This doesn't even look like more than a couple of hundred characters. Does the
    number increment in a fairly regular steps?\r\n\r\nOh, and I totally dig this
    use of all-caps, then small caps, then indented regular text, for a one glance
    hierarchical view! Complete with extra long em-dash, and even a typical space
    <em>before</em> the colon. What year is this from? It mentions \"aircraft\", I
    actually thought the space before colons was much older than those ... (*)\r\n\r\nCan
    you take a close-up picture of the font itself?\r\n\r\n(*) Edit: oops -- 1938.
    Got it ..."

  body: The letter L on the right will be a signature mark, but I would guess that
    the 4,604 on the left will be the printer's job number for this title. It could
    be useful for this identification to be known in the bindery, partly to ensure
    that signatures from one book weren't accidentally bound with signatures from
    another; and partly, perhaps, for administrative purposes, so that workers would
    know which job number to enter on their work dockets (or something like that).

    are a few more images. i thought that the number might be the total number of
    words in the whole book. I think there is an easy way of me estimating it so ill
    have a look into that myslef.\r\n\r\nhere are a few more images from the book.
    a close up of the font and the contents page witch is beautiful.  \r\n\r\nP"
