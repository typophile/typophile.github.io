    on Friz Quadrata. There''s a lot of differences, even the stroke weights are different. '

  body: "The stroke weights are easily changed by adding white stroke, but I am not
    disagreeing with you. The truth is that it was probably drawn using Friz as a
    model (my guess) by someone who wouldn't need to resort to my crude methods. \r\n\r\nI
    always tend to approach questions like this by describing what I would do if I
    had to try to approximate this look. Some of our other members who are font designers
    would no doubt cringe at my brute force suggestions, but I just ID fonts, not
    design them. (Some things we have seen here look like whoever did them has similar
    lack of design talent ;-))\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
