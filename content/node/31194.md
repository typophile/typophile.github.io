body: "This isn't the first time somebody has asked to redistribute one of my free
  fonts, but something struck me as a little bit different here. Might anyone have
  suggestions on how I should deal with it? I've granted generous licences for minimal
  compensation before to a couple small game developers (since the fonts are free
  already I just asked for some copies of the games) but this outfit seems in a different
  sort of position. I'm not sure what it is exactly, but it feels different.\r\nThis
  inquiry is specifically about my font <a href=\"http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=2585\">Bolonewt</a>.\r\n\r\n<cite>Hello
  from good old germany ;)\r\n\r\nWe are developers of a photobook solution, that
  we license to digital \r\nprinting houses.\r\nOur photobook client is installed
  more than 100.000 times in germany, \r\nand \r\neven in Israel.\r\nWe want to include
  some new fonts in the next version of our client, so \r\nwe \r\nare searching\r\naround
  for some public domain or freeware fonts we can include in our \r\nsetup.\r\n\r\nWe
  found your webpage and find some of your fonts very useful for our \r\nphotobook
  client.\r\nWould it be possible, that we can include some of your fonts in our \r\nphotobook
  client and\r\nredistribute them with the setup?\r\nThe photobook software is always
  freeware for the end user. We do not \r\nmake \r\nany money\r\nwith the the download
  or installation of the photobook client.\r\n\r\nIt would give us great pleasure
  if we can use some of your fonts. Of \r\ncourse \r\nwe will credit\r\nyour fonts/webpage
  in the help file of the software.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nThomas Bauer\r\n\r\n\r\n__PRINTAHEAD

  body: But do they  make money from the other end? Once installed is it like iPhoto
    where you can make calendars and booklets which you must purchase? I'm being skeptical,
    but it seems to me what your fonts will be used for are probably where they make
    there money. Am I wrong?

  body: "I'd ask for a pointer to a demo, where you can see what value your fonts
    might add to their application. Maybe ask for names of other freeware designers
    who have given up their fonts, and contact them for their thoughts.\r\n\r\nCheers,
    Si"

  body: "I'd ask for a little more than minimal compensation. It sounds like it's
    a moneymaking proposition for them, and I don't get the sense they're being completely
    upfront when they say they make no money on the client. While technically true,
    no doubt they're counting on the \"atttach rate\" to sell printing and/or services.\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck!"
