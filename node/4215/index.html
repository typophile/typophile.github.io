		<div class="commentbody">here's the deal. i didn't mean to sound like that was my web site. i didn't make it, and i don't know who did. i'm just a believer. my passion for hating comic sans is a healthy (i hope) blend of satire and frustration. i'm a design student, graduating in december, and i'm completely bewildered by other students who use it because it's &quot;cute&quot; or whatever reason they give. like, lewis, i think it's just an arbitrary decision on their part, as if typography is some kind of minor detail they slap on their project at the last minute. that offends me. here's a funny story from school: i was in the library looking for a specific book for my typography class and couldn't find it. i went to ask the person at the desk (ostensibly a librarian, but&hellip;) to help me find a book on typography. she said (and this is an exact quote), &quot;a book about typing? let's see&hellip;&quot;. typing? typography! gee my krug! anyway, like lewis' prof, i just get so tired of seeing it when there are so many other options.  a lot of my message also goes to the administartive offices at school. i don't know if they think we like it or what, but there are always notices and announcements on the bulletin boards set completely in comic sans, and sometimes they get fancy and go with corsiva. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fonts i like? that's a huge can of worms, as you can imagine. my first love was univers (don't laugh) just because it's so simple and consistent through all of it's weights. i dig a lot of zuzana licko's stuff, and local heroes thirst have some cool stuff. btw, be on the lookout for ex-thirst designer patricking's new font next year. he gave me a sneak peek at it a while back. it's based on some herbert bayer sketches, so obviously it's going to be, y'know, bayerish, but i love it so far. also, some of the fonts i've seen in the critique boards here have blown me away. off the top of my head: review beta by jared benson and pill gothic by christian robetson. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->i feel like hrant with this ultra-long post. so bj, i hope you don't think i'm going to assassinate vince. i really am a nice guy. if you're ever in chicago i'll prove it. you can stay at my place if you need to (sorry, not in my bed. my wife has that spot), or i'll just make you some cinnamon rolls or something.</div>

I was responding to the person who said Comic Sans was an AMATEUR font. It is as far from AMATEUR as you get. You may think the letters in the font are ugly, but that is another thing entirely. It was made by a guy who was PAID to DESIGN TYPE.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; most people at my school who  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; are clueless prefer comic sans,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Isn't being clueless subjective? How do you know that these people aren't trying to target an audience who might appreciate this typeface? It doesn't bother me personally that you do not like it, I just think your reasoning needs a little more work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; i think because it's closer to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the beginning of the font menu.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think this is an asinine reason. Do you really think people outside of &quot;the world of typography&quot; have no desire to make a statement or visually communicate to others? Isn't that a bit judgmental? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; so it's one amateur  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; font at a time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another asinine remark. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; today my professor asked me to delete Comic Sans off of all the computers <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is one solution to this &quot;supposed&quot; problem. But wouldn't a more appropriate solution be to simply educate the students about the typefaces which are not to be used (along with sound reasoning as to why). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; students who use it because it's &quot;cute&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But, if this is the reason they are using it, maybe they feel it communicates cute. Again, subjective. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; More interesting is the aviary connection: canard/mapgpie.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Really? :-D How bizarre. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; It's funny to think of Comic Sans as an &quot;amateur font&quot;&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I'm not going to argue that what typeface people use&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; But really what this comes down to is a foolish exercise&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Instead of wasting time with little web sites and clandestine font deleting&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well spoken. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Anybody who strikes down ComicSans based on technical merit is a retard. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->:-D Totally agree. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; aesthetic/cultural <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What about the fact that this says a lot about the break-down (read: total failure) of the educational system. When I have taught typography/design classes I always give the students a week or two for experimentation. Then when they bring in roughs set in a typeface that is meant for the viewing on a computer, I show them and explain to them why their selection isn't sound. I have had a few students insist they chose the best face and to them I would smile and nod. I cannot design for them, I can only help in the process. It is, after all, their portfolio. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; no amount of discussing or proseletyzing <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is sad, but true. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; but to other students and designers lack of effort and care when they use it <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For those that do choose poorly their typefaces, well it let's those of us that supposedly &quot;know&quot; what we are doing truly shine. (Tongue in cheek) Kinda separating the, ahem, men from the boys. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&mdash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I was in England, Vinnie actually showed me this site. He thought it was hilarious. He knows the font was developed for a children's computer application and it was never meant to be included in the font pack for the public. As Joe pointed out and I've experienced first hand, finding the typeface used in odd situations is a game for Vinnie. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the ban should be on &quot;bad communication&quot; not the poor little unassuming typeface. Typography in the end isn't, as Yer Momma has stated, about the typeface. I think it does play a part. Certainly a typeface can communicate and imply many things. Comic sans is not, perhaps, the most appropriate choice for an airline company. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I personally think more time should be spent educating ourselves and helping those that truly do want help. Not wasting energy and time on the details that really don't matter, such as banishing a typeface that doesn't need banishing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe a bit wordy. In the end, it comes down to education and that makes me sad. Sad that instead of trying to educate we are simply becoming boring and dogmatic. Leave poor comic sans, and helvetica for that matter, alone.</div>

But from the perspective of a *maker* of type, there is very much a good and bad to it (even if it's subjective) - just like you can use a font well or poorly! For example, the letterspacing in Helvetica is *bad*. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

Again, subjective. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->again, my laziness. i forgot that you all haven't seen it in the contexts i reference. comic sans on a hip hop cd cover? i reckon not. i've inquired as to the use of this font during critiques, and generally the answer is, &quot;it's cute&quot;, or, &quot;i just thought it worked.&quot; so there really isn't any attempt to communicate any sort of feeling or vibe, it was just there. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt;i think because it's closer to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt;the beginning of the font menu.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;I think this is an asinine reason.

People who don't might  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have a different sense of humor, but they also might <!-- raw HTML omitted -->be taking this far too seriously. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. A font's location in the font menu can have an  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->influence on the user's selection. I know it because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've seen it - more than once. People who don't care <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or are short on time, rush to the first font that agrees  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with them. A font near the top of the menu has a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good chance of getting picked. I'm not talking about  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->designers here, I'm talking about people who do not  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->earn a living using type. They are people with an  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->immediate need, whipping out a flyer or sign. Their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->contribution is still important - these people produce <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a pretty big part of what the world sees.</div>
