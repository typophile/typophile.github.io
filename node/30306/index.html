<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello everyone. I've been lurking around the forum for a while and decided to finally post. I choose the crit section because eventually that's what this will be.
I'm trying to decide on the best way to use my name (Chris Butts) as my freelance design identity. The reasons to use it are because it's different, memorable, and the thing I'm known for. The reasons not to use it are because it can be associated with obvious things like toilets and well... crap.
Lately I've been thinking that spelling the name is enough and that I don't need some rendering of a rear end next to it. I've always been interested in typography and thought this might be a time where a purely typographic logo solution is in order. I'm doing some typographic thumbnails and will post them soon.
Let me know if you have any thoughts on this. I'd like to hear what others think!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sounds cool! What process are you going about to create your typographic based logo? Also welcome and maybe some background info about your company?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well... the process has just started. I've been drawing my name out and I have a few hand lettered versions that I like. I'm trying to do a lot of stuff based off of my handwriting which is an all caps style that most say looks like a draftsman's handwriting.
There's no background to my company yet. I'm a design student who's been doing freelance work for a while now. I don't have anything to put in front of people explaining who I am and what I do, so I figure now is the time. I don't do any web design. Everything is for print. Most of my jobs have been logo design, brochures, and stuff like that.
Yeah, grade school was fun! I did think about using a cigarette butt. I did a whole mess of thumbnails using different kinds of butts besides the human kind. I like your idea of going super clean with it though.
I've been trying to decide for the longest time whether or not to use the name or make up a new name. To ingnore it seemed wrong so here I am. If I can't get it to work I'll try something else. I'm definately not wanting people to associate my work with a toilet though.
One of the ideas I came up with that I seem to like is using parenthesis as a subtle image of a butt. Something like this...
(chris)(butts)
I don't want to get stuck on it though, so I'm trying to push myself to come up with many good ideas before I select just a few.

Oh dear. Must have been tough in grade school, eh? ;o)
I like the idea of an all typographic logo. 'Butts' sounds dirty, and it might be nice to render it in some over-the-top elegant/swashy calligraphic typeface.
That or a used ashtray. Maybe take random photos of used cigarettes and use them as your identity elements. </div>

Your name is definitely memorable. However, this may be a good reason to not use it as your freelance idenity. By creating a different name, you can develop a completely diffent identity for your freelance business -- all the while avoiding conjuring associations with the commode.
If you do decide to stick with naming your freelance business after yourself, definitely avoid the potty humor. Select characteristics of your work with which you'd like an audience to connect. </div>

Bart: Is Seymore there? Last name, Butts.
Moe: Just a sec. (calling out) Hey, is there a Butts here? Seymore Butts? Hey, everybody. I wanna Seymore Butts!
Moe: (catching on) Hey, wait a minute. Listen, you little scum-sucking pus-bucket. When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna pull out your eyeballs with a corkscrew.
