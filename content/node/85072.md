  body: "Thanks guys. That's a quick response!\r\n\r\n@craig: I agree on the r. I
    probably need to make it thicker where it meets the ball terminal. What you say
    about p r n is a difficult subject. Do you feel the same about Lexicon? The spur
    on q should maybe be bigger, otherwise I don't see the problem. I dislike the
    loop of the g in many typefaces, so it's good to know you like mine :-)\r\n\r\n@santiago:
    I disagree with both. They shouldn't be anything, except for looking good and
    being legible, which they are. Have a look at Lexicon."

    did to me too. However, after a while (non-typedesigners are not bothered by it
    in the first place) I got used to it. In text, it creates something that untill
    now (hopefully) could only be achieved with Lexicon. I don't know how to explain
    it, and really you should see the NRC Handelsblad in real life to find out, but
    looks 'new', fresh and vivid.\r\n\r\nUnderneath is a picture for a quick comparison.
    As you might tell from the picture, I'm trying to catch that \"newness\" from
    Lexicon, while toning down the quirks, making it suitable for display usage too.
    I also included some Sensato traits, leaving my personal mark. Well, that's the
    idea.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture12_3978.png]"

    and too wide. It looks like a willow tree hanging out over a river, but the tiny
    baseline serif is not big enough to support the weight. This is entirely out of
    place with lively feeling in the rest of the letters.\r\n\r\nOverall I like the
    feeling of this face. At first glance it seems like a typical Dutch book face.
    But the more I look the more I see something much more youthful and vibrant. Keep
    putting that energy into the font as you fill it out. Watch out for calligraphic
    curves that start getting soft, which is happening to the loop of the g and the
    descender of the y."

  body: "There is something not quite right about the execution of what appears to
    be a design principle: the asymmetric serifs. The left ones are curving, the right
    ones straight(ish). That principle is not upheld in for instance the /x/ and the
    /k/. \r\n\r\nThe other thing that bothers me is the application of the flare-like
    broadening of certain elements that unhinge the balance of certain glyphs. Eg
    in your larger sample it shows in the /ij/ combination. I assume both glyphs share
    most of their form, but the /i/ appears to lean back to the right in comparison
    to the /j/. I think that the stress introduced by that broadening needs to be
    compensated in the lower part of /i/ by (maybe) extending the serif a bit, or
    putting some stress in the area where the stem approaches the serif.\r\n\r\nThat
    said \u2014 I kinda like the overall design. "

    making it smooth just doesn't work. I might get rid of the asymmetrical serifs,
    though the difference between letter like v w x and n m l doesn't bother me at
    all.\r\n\r\nI suppose by \"flare-like broadening\" you mean the bend to the right
    at the top of i and j. This is seen in many fonts and is actually to compensate
    for the serif at the top left. What do you mean with \"lean back to the right\"?\r\n\r\nI'm
    glad you like it :-)\r\n\r\nOfftopic: I was told there's an article in the Publish

    I'd made first is to give both the serif and sans /g a taller bottom (by reducing
    the waist).\r\n\r\n* Really, what proportion of usable fonts are? Some well-known

  body: "Good improvements overall.\r\n\r\nThe serif-'a' needs a hand on the upper
    terminal. The terminals of 'c', 'r' and 'f' are well accomplished, but in 'a'
    the terminal doesn't return inwards (sorry for the pleonasm), but it stays in
    the same angle and gradually tends upwards. The consequence is a hanging terminal.
    I also see you've aligned it with the bowl from the left side\u2020. Often, the
    terminal doesn't hang as far to the left as the bowl\u2020\u2020. As for the terminal
    of 'y', it looks unsteady\u2020\u2020\u2020.\r\n\r\nThe serif lengths are not
    consistent. Particularly, the upper serif of x-height letters could be longer
    (see /qu/ pair).\r\n\r\nNice 'd'/'q'.\r\n\r\n\u2020  And why did you change your
    mind? They weren't aligned before!\r\n\u2020\u2020  The uttermost example could
    be <i>Diotima</i>. If you take a look at the opposite extreme, I don't know any
    'a' that hangs more than <i>Caslon</i>'s.\r\n\u2020\u2020\u2020  Can you post
    a PDF or a bigger image of the character set next time? I wanted to look closer
    at the upper right of 'z' :-)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@hrant\r\n\r\nFor me, the term
    'usable' embraces almost all existant fonts, but I think you're referring specifically
    to text-font usability.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Some well-known designers never produce
    anything really original their entire careers.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI'm curious
    about which designers do you mean by that, but naturally, it's something you wouldn't
    be posting in this forum :-)"

    for naming names, there's not much to be gained from that. Now, if one of them
    happens to say \"this is not very original\" here then I surely couldn't keep
    my mouth shut. But I think we're safe because the boring ones don't like discussing
    things [in public] in the first place.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "First impression: the full stop is too heavy. Aim for something similar to
    the thinner part of the diagonal width. (Hope this makes sense).\r\nAlso: I prefer
    slightly taller descenders and ascenders. There IS a point where the portruding
    parts help figuring out the shape and meaning of words for the reader. That means
    that there has to be a certain difference between the x-height and the glyphs
    that \u2018hold out their arms\u2019. Try blurring some samples in PhotoShop and
    you will see what I mean.\r\n\r\nOn an altogether different note: why are you
    aiming for a coherent sans/serif family? Why not cut your teeth on a display face?"

  body: "I have't really looked at the full stop in detail, but I guess you're right.\r\n\r\nThe
    length of ascenders and descenders is a tough call, because it has to match the
    sans serif. Or would it be ok to give the serif longer ascenders/descenders?\r\n\r\nI'm
    going sans/serif because 0. It's a great learning experience. 1. It's a way to
    stand out (if not much) from the crowd. 2. It's functional. 3. Designers like
    it a lot because they think it takes away their job of pairing fonts, so it should
    help sales. Perhaps I'll also make a display version out of Sensato Serif, but
    that's not really on my mind now.\r\n\r\npdf is up :-)"

  body: "Think about how the sans and serif need to work together. How often will
    they be mixed inline, and if they are, do serifs not play a role in apparent size?
    And maybe deviating their apparent size could actually be useful... In any case,
    remember that in a text font lining things up exactly is almost never the point,
    so don't discount nudging around things like the x-height. I <em>would</em> keep
    the caps and numerals lined up though.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
