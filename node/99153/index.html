  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for some help with a nice font combination for my PhD thesis. I wrote it in MS Word (big mistake), but after seeing the font used by LaTeX (CMU family), I initially chose CMU Bright for headings and CMU Serif for body text.</p>
<p>This feels a little antiquated now, and I&rsquo;d like a clean and modern feel to the thesis. I&rsquo;ve been playing with a couple of different font combinations, and have settled on:</p>
<p>Open Sans (Light/Bold)
Bree (Thin)</p>

Also, Bree is a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif|sans serif]] font designed particularly for large sizes, it is advised to use serif fonts for long texts; particularly if the content is academic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If this were an advertising job designed to grab peoples' attention on casual inspection, such charmingly decorative fonts might be just the thing.  OTOH, a PhD thesis generally has a captive audience already, and in any case is intended to convince people by virtue of its content, not its typography.</p>
<p>What you want here is something that (a) is comfortably readable, (b) looks professional, and (c) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->doesn&rsquo;t get in the way<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the content.  IMO anything else is not only superfluous, but counterproductive.</p>
<p>When typesetting book or academic text – or anything where the content is the critical aspect – the ideal font is one which the reader doesn&rsquo;t even consciously notice, so long as it accomplishes (a), (b) and (c) as noted above.  Any &lsquo;message&rsquo; that the fonts convey should be strictly subconscious.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;ve heard more than one professional say that when they see overtly beautiful fonts in resumes or academic work, their immediate thought is &ldquo;OK, what&rsquo;s the author trying to hide?&quot;)</p>
<p>For the body text, I definitely think serif type is called for.  (I know some people challenge the theory that serif types are easier to read in running text, but I&rsquo;m a firm believer in that particular orthodoxy.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the responses. I&rsquo;ve been looking for a clean serif font for a while and haven&rsquo;t found one I can settle on.</p>
<p>My thesis is on the natural barrier that exists between the blood and brain (to protect the brain and provide all the nutrients it needs in a carefully controlled way), and uses our current understanding for the design of next generation drugs to treat brain conditions. Not exactly bed time reading!</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s a thesis it&rsquo;s not something that people would ordinarily come across, so my font selection is more about reducing reader fatigue and clean presentation, rather than pulling them in for aesthetics.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Will your thesis contain many equations, formulas, or tables of numerical data? If so, compare the numeral <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the lowercase <!-- raw HTML omitted -->l<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the capital <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in any font you&rsquo;re considering. In many sans-serif faces, it&rsquo;s difficult to tell those three characters apart, which leads to confusion in reading equations and formulas.</div>

<p>Simplified structure (if that&rsquo;s what you mean by &ldquo;clean&rdquo;) doesn&rsquo;t necessarily correlate to ease/comfort in reading.  Personally, I think a traditional face like Bembo, Galliard, or Janson makes for superbly readable, comfortable text.</p>
<p>If by &ldquo;clean&rdquo; you&rsquo;re thinking of something more in the transitional vein, I recall seeing an article not long ago which claimed that people were statistically slightly more likely to agree with something set in Baskerville than with other fonts.  For a PhD it might be an edge worth thinking about.  :-)</p>
<p>If you want something specifically open and uncluttered, Constantia actually isn&rsquo;t a bad face, although I&rsquo;m not sure how well it would hold up for dense multi-page writing.</p>
<p>Speaking personally, for a long time I favoured Marty Pfeiffer&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nu Serif<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for prose.  It&rsquo;s a nicely neutral serif face which is easy to read, although the high x-height may not be everybody&rsquo;s cup of tea.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@hrant: Well, it was the first font family I ever bought, so I have a certain soft spot for it.  The designer claims it for an adaptation of a bitmap font called Espy Serif; since I have (after all) done something similar with Workplace Sans, I was inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.  His fonts are also very well hinted, which doesn&rsquo;t strike me as typical for quickie-knockoff jobs.</p>
<p>OTOH, you&rsquo;ve a point that the letterforms are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> similar to Stone Serif (with some subtle differences), which I never actually noticed before.  My only exposure, hitherto, to Stone is some samples in the Meggs-Carter book; I&rsquo;ve never used it myself, although I&rsquo;m thinking now maybe I should look into it some more. :)</p>
<p>@OP: Bembo is my favourite face for &ldquo;book&rdquo; style text.  I think it&rsquo;d be an excellent choice.  (For shorter professional documents I tend to prefer Sabon, but it may be a bit condensed for lengthy prose.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">There is a reason for some fonts having a darker texture — as Alex mentions; it makes the printed matter more comfortable to reader. I would go with Garamond, but it will take someone very experienced in typography to make it work well. If you are having trouble in choosing the right font, it&rsquo;s better to pay attention to what will professionals recommend. I would advise you to use either Cambria or Constantia as your main body font.</div>
