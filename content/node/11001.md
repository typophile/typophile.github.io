body: Here is my first typeface. It is a modular unicase system designed to combine
  aspects of upper and lowercase characters &#40;when possible&#41;. The forms are
  inspired by a combination of japanese architecture and digital display. Any feedback
  is welcomed. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/8890.jpg"

  body: That&#39;s kind of fun. <BR> <BR>How small of a type size were you thinking?
    <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;d like to see some text laid out in the face. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t
    stop experimenting!

  body: The  &#34;A&#34; is my favorite.    <BR>    <BR>I think you could add a tail
    to the &#34;U&#34; to have    <BR>some more of that UC, LC thing going on and  <BR>serve
    to distinguish it even further from the &#34;V&#34;.    <BR>    <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/8921.gif"

  body: Nick - nice fresh approach! <BR> <BR>Welcome to typophile. <BR> <BR>X, Z and
    3 are glyphs <BR>that you might take a second look at. <BR> <BR>A and B are really
    nice. <BR> <BR>Maybe R could use a tweak? <BR> <BR>If you want to market it, <BR>consider
    Mr. Segura. <BR> <BR> <BR>bj <BR>

  body: I kind of like it in outlines too.  <BR>I also was surprised that it reads
    pretty well at smaller sizes <BR>agree/ disagree?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/9054.jpg"

  body: 'I think you have made some great choices here.  <BR>  <BR>The &#34;R: looks
    great, @, X, and 3 also look better.  <BR>  <BR>How do you plan, expect or want
    this design to  <BR>be used?  John asked;  <BR>  <BR>&#62;<i>How small of a type
    size were you thinking? </i>   <BR>  <BR>This would be good to know.   <BR>  <BR>Also,
    if you could, please set it in some text   <BR>that we are unfamiliar with- to
    test it&#39;s readability.   <BR>But please, post it smaller.  <BR>  <BR>-sean

  body: We seem to be posting at the same time but I <BR>think my questions are still
    relevant.  <BR> <BR>I am not as fond of the outline. <BR> <BR>Also, what if you
    created a bottom bowl on the <BR>lc &#34;g&#34; by creating a line extending to
    the left? <BR>I think it would have more of that dichotomy you  <BR>are  seeking.
