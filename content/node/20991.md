body: "So here is a new font that I\u2019m working on, decided to show it off a little.
  So far I\u2019m liking it, looking for suggestions and critique. Thanks. \r\n\r\ni
  know that i have to move \"r\" up, make \"o\" a little larger, maybe \"i\" and \"l\"
  longer and extend them a little below the baseline, looks like \"y\" is falling
  forward.. i would chop the tail off \"s\" but it looks way to good in \"is\"...
  well all of that will get done  tomorrow...\r\n\r\n <strong>UPDATE </strong>\r\n\r\nOk,
  so Im trying to finish my last year of college while working so I can't get to finish
  this font, for those of you who liked it, you can download lower case character
  set at:\r\nwww.akaboom.com/water/waterworldtop.ttf\r\nand\r\nwww.akaboom.com/water/waterworldbottom.ttf
  \r\njust copy paste in place the text and change one of the layers to one of the
  font variations and colors for best results.\r\n\r\nenjoy!"

  body: "Wow - a very cool font. I like it a lot. Beautiful, poetic and original.
    I am in the believe that typography has two purposes - one is everything about
    reading, and the other is about identity and/or personality \u2013 to help the
    designer express something. You little beauty is really personal, and I like to
    use it sometime.\r\n\r\nOne thing however:\r\nHave you tried making the \"a\"
    a little smaller? It could be mistaken for \"o\" as it is now."

  body: "This is a fun concept, I'm curious to see how it evolves. My first thought
    was that the base letterforms are too geometric. The swashes stemming off look
    to be drawn with a different hand, more elegant than the heavy part of the glyph.
    Right now they seem like two separate parts rather than one organic face. Maybe
    that's what you are going for.\r\n\r\nI like how the letters interact with tighter
    kerning. If I used this type it would be in display settings, one or two words."

  body: I would experiment with different amounts of embellishment. I think slightly
    less embellshment would make the face more useful. The curls might be made to
    seem integral to the letters too. Right now they seem a bit pasted-on. I concur
    with what Anthony ( graphicfuzz)  said about the base letterfoms being a bit too
    geometric. The 'a' especially.

    characters, to make them more unified with the curls, and lessen the amount of

    idea, layering old and new characters, I think it works well, what do you think?\r\n"

  body: "Coming along. I like how you've resolved the curls on some of these characters
    (the \"a\" is working better, and especially prefer this simpler \"o\"). Some
    characters still need work IMO: c, e, s, y, z stand out.\r\n\r\nI still wish the
    base forms were more \"caligraphic\" (don't know if this is correct term). Strokes
    need more thick-and-thin variation - you're doing it in some places, I think it
    needs more to avoid looking so tube-like. Hopefully, someone with more tyographic
    knowledge can advise you.\r\n\r\nThe layering is a nice effect - adds some energy
    and movement. In fact if you really wanted to broaden the scope of this project,
    maybe you could make an alternate set with different curls to be used specifically
    for the purpose of ovelapping."

      some work, and then resume working on the font, I should make some progress
      by the end of next week. \r\n\r\nGood luck"

  body: "My impression is that things are geting better. The base letter forms & the
    curls seem to belong together more now.  There are still some problems in two
    areas that I want to suggest you look at. \r\n\r\nOne is in the base forms themselves.
    For instance- the t is so tall it almost reads as an f. The a is still a bit more
    abstracted than I would like. Perhaps if the lower bubble was smaller that would
    help. Look after your letterforms a bit more & consider some ways to make their
    legibility greater. You can always go back afterwards & add the the curls. Also,
    it might be fun to have a face that the curls add to rather than just one face.\r\n\r\nThe
    second issue is the way the letters interact next to each other. As things stand
    the interaction is a little too random. If you alter your base forms & carefully
    consider your curl placement the parts can be made to fit together ( or overlap
    ) in a way that feels less random & more organic. All the randomness is creating
    a level of background noise that hurts the fonts ability to be read."

    and taken into the consideration all the mentioned points. I got most of the needed
    sketching done and will start transferring them from paper into the digital realm
    on monday. Once again thank you all for your input, You been lots of help... If
    you are curious to see what will come of this check back in a week or so. Ill
    talk to you later.\r\n\r\nAleksey"

  body: "A little late for a reply maybe, but I just wanted you to know your font
    IS superfunky! As opposed to GraphicFuzz, I actually like the absence of calligraphic
    thick-thin variations. I think the straight lines add to the personality of your
    font.\r\nI think it might work great as decorated capitals in use with another
    font. The bodytext is maybe too much, but the alphabet line is s\xF2\xF2\xF2 cool!\r\nHope
    you'll be posting your progress here."
