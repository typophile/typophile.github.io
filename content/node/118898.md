  body: "Is that magazine [[http://www.vogue.com|Vogue]], by any chance? Your sample
    reminds me of a typeface called Vogue which Intertype designed for Vogue Magazine
    in the 1930's.\r\n\r\nThe New Yorker used a custom typeface called NY Vogue Goat
    (an extrabold Vogue) until a recent design overhaul. Even still, there isn't currently
    a readily available copy of Vogue for license. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.terminaldesign.com/fonts/vf-sans-complete-family/|VF
    Sans]], a typeface for Vanity Fair by James Montalbano, is really similar and
    has [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/VF-Sans-Finally-set-free/10141327|only recently
    been available]] for individuals to license. Montalbano says that he wasn't aiming
    to make a Vogue revival but I consider the multiple resulting weights of type
    to be a happy accident.\r\n\r\nTwo weights of Am Sans by Volker Busse, another
    similar to Vogue, used to be available through a lot of freeware sites. I'm not
    sure about the licensing details so I can't confidently recommend it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vogue-bold_6085.png]"

  body: Thanks for the reply! The magazine is actually 'Science Fiction Plus.' The
    typeface looks very similar to the ones you posted. However, the W, M, and Q are
    quite different. Just added a photo of the Q. Many thanks for all the info!

  body: "Rob, you have an interstellar bulls-eye.\r\nAFAIK nobody has done a digital
    version.\r\nThe magazine was a unique publishing effort from 1953. An attempt
    to produce a Science Fiction magazine that was a slick, not a pulp. Hence the
    stylish typeface.  Info on the magazine http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science-Fiction_Plus
    BTW the wiki misses the fact that in addition to fiction, the magazine published
    extensive science speculation articles ranging from how to build an interstellar
    multi-generation spaceship -- with detailed plans -- to life on mars. I still
    have my copies of all seven issues. \r\nDon"
