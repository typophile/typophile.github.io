  body: Maybe you should buy yourself some books (e.g. the FontBook) and actually
    look there before you simply pass along the work to other people. We like to help,
    generally, but this way, you'll never learn anything yourself.

  body: Hear hear, Erik. I often think the "Where can I do my own research?" section
    of the FAQ ought to be a stand-alone. I understand that a lot of people are busy
    or just need a one-off ID and also that it takes a certain amount of time and
    experience to get to know how to ID a font, but when I see multiple repeat posters
    I start to wonder if they're just a little lazy.

  body: yes, I do have a font book but some of them are not in the book and most of
    them are found typefaces either by me or other people. Thats why I'm here to ask
    all the questions I've been having. Is that wrong? :(

  body: "typopo_80> No you are not wrong! You are fine. It is advantageous to have
    a comprehensive catalog of fonts for your own reference as stated. However, often
    times the types that inspires us are used in such a way that is unexpected. This
    charms us and we want to know more about the type being used. Sometimes you discover
    that the font you want to know about is something you have already worked with
    or are familiar with. Yet you didn't recognize it because it looks so far from
    your expectations.\r\n\r\nIf you post often, I don't think you are lazy. I think
    you are person who loves type. So you're no problem. If someone disagrees with
    your frequent posts take the educational value from it but no one knows your situation
    like you. No one cares about your needs like you. And if you take of you, everyone
    else can take a long walk off a short pier- right? :-)\r\n\r\nAnd besides, for
    a great deal of the people that participate in the Typophile ID's- its a race
    to who has the correct answer first. Its a fun thing and many people derive pleasure
    from participating. I don't care how I help the other person- I just care that
    I help them.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz ;-)"

  body: "I still think it's wrong to ask without looking first if you can find it
    yourself. That way, you never learn what to look for and how to look. Most of
    the faces you posted are in the FontBook or other easily available sources. You
    will not benefit from easy answers, but from having to figure it out yourself.\r\n\r\n<br>That
    has nothing to do with other people having fun identifying posts.</br>"

  body: "eriks> What you fail realize is that I recognize this user, typopo_80, is
    totally new here. And possibly new to the world of type in general. Often times
    it's not just where you go to learn. Its how-to-learn-how-to-learn. How to go
    about starting the learning process (in type that is).  That's why I said when
    someone disagrees with the frequent posts, take the criticisms in a didactic manner.
    The way you suggested can be better for some, but we should not be too quick to
    judge or place conditions on new people as they get their start. Once you start
    on Typophile, you don't stop, so I think the rest of what you are talking about
    will come naturally in the future. \r\n\r\nAlso, Typo does have the FontBook but
    at 1700 pages plus, its understandable that someone who is inexperienced perceiving
    the nuances of type (Myriad vs. Bliss, Fago vs. Unit)  After pages of Handgloves
    and abcdefghi... it's not laziness.  So he is doing the right thing coming here.
    In another post Typo indicated that he attempted using some web resources but
    he did not understand it. Can you blame him? Type \"font information\" in Google.
    See all that 'stuff'. Its a lot to swallow. And Typo is doing the best he knows
    how.  Its fortunate he is Typophile member so he can learn more from the pros
    themselves.\r\n\r\nAs far ID-er's having fun: I said this because some people
    questioned his motives for posting the ID's. When in reality it is his business
    and its not like he's running the white house. We don't need to give Typo the
    frownies :-( over trivial things like fonts. Insert chill-pill in mouth, chase
    with water.\r\n\r\nWe might have extensive knowledge about whatever subject we
    hold dear, but we need to take into consideration the skill level and natural
    ability of others when sharing it. And that requires humility.\r\n\r\n\r\nMike
