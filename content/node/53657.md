    of the d looks off. You might try moving the de a space to the right and moving
    the ts a space to the left to tighten up the kerning. '

    version: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_d3_6588.png]\r\n\r\nI used Illustrator
    this time and if you look closely enough you will see that the shape inside the
    \"d\" is actually a copy of the \"b\" in \"designbits\". I also adjusted kerning
    a little. Do you think this logo has got potential?\r\n\r\nThanks for any input...\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

  body: I think the stylized d is a bit too close in spacing to your wordmark - in
    the sense that my brain is trying to figure out why is there 2 "d"'s? Although
    the size difference does help create "space". Also the white oval within the d
    looks...I don't know, too stark. The colors overall are good and I generally like
    the feel of what you have going. But what if you had a capital B on the reverse
    of the d but pixelate it? Just another idea. Good luck.

    It really depends on how important seeing the 'b' is to you. This iteration is
    probably too subtle for most people, but maybe you want that. Personally, I'd
    make it a little more apparent."

    Why would I add a capital B on the reverse of the d? There's no capital B in the

    I''m having a hard time thinking of anything that I would change. Maybe change
    the white square "pixel" to the lighter blue. I''m thinking the contrast is a
    bit much which maybe why people see an eye as opposed to the counter of the "d". '

    some quick help in photoshop. The few things I have are check your spacings (regardless
    of the logo you are choosing) See what lines up with what else. Make conscious
    efforts about how thing should grid and correspond together. Should designbits
    text be as tall as the d? Should the bottom of design bits line up with the white
    circle in the middle? Web Design should be just as wide as the left side of the
    lowercase n and right end of that word. Bottom image: I don't like the thickness
    of the d, I think you should move the lowercase d so that it keeps the same thickness
    all the way around. Would improve the over all \"flow\" of the mark. I like this
    first font you used, the second ones are popular font and have more of a fun cartoony
    feel. Take it for what its worth. my 2 cents :)\r\n\r\nP.S. Guides are your friends,
    you have the power to make things perfect (computer) so why not do it? \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: It is a clean and pleasant looking logo, but it does indeed look generic.
    Some small design element to customize the type may go a long way. Something as
    simple as turning T into 6 spaced squares (bits) or pixelating "design". Perhaps
    even using some form of "designer pixels", something with a bit of a flare.
