    looking for a completed font. I pretty much figured that I would need to make
    the font myself - I was just looking for some info on what typefaces were being
    used in that area at that time.\r\n\r\nNow that I'm looking at fonts, Garamond\u2019s
    letterforms look pretty close, and they were produced at the right time. Were
    they being widely used in Spain c. 1650?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/64/Original-CG.gif\"
    alt=\"Garamond Example Image\"></img>\r\n\r\nI basically just need a jumping-off
    point. The font will need to be pretty distressed, so I'll probably end up making
    my own version of whatever typeface it is.\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm being a bit fussy
    is that the book in question won't have any identifying printer's marks and is
    located as to time and place by internal typographical evidence only, so it needs
    to be fairly accurate. If I could find a typeface produced exclusively in mid-17th
    Century Spain, that would be perfect, but I don't want to get my hopes up.\r\n\r\nPretty
    much anything that will \"pass\" as period correct with the correct letterforms
    will do. I know I'm asking a pretty odd question, so thank you all for your patience.

    influenced by the French & the Low Countries. \r\n\r\nReligious printing in Spain
    was held in monopoly by Christophe Plantin (of Antwerp) and his heirs for centuries.
    The types of Plantin-Moretus \u2014 cut by the likes of Guyot, de Sanlecque, Granjon,

    all appreciated, but I would like to respond to a couple of folks individually:\r\n\r\n@Riccardo:\r\n<em>As
    long as it\u2019s not a hundred years late</em>\r\n\r\nHa, ha, you're right of
    course! :)\r\nGilles Le Corre's (GLC) fonts look great, perfect for all my oddball
    \"period\" printings. I myself have made a period correct 1770s American Colonial
    \"Caslon Pamphleteer\" font, so I can appreciate all of his hard work. I'll keep
    his fonts in mind for future projects.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Fell types; I had
    thought seriously about using them, but wasn't sure if they would have been used
    in Spain at that time, hence the posting here for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n@Kent:\r\nThank
    you so much for all the historical info - that's exactly what I was looking for.
    The recommendation for Updike\u2019s <em>Printing Types</em> is especially welcome;
    I hadn't heard of that before. I'll be spending this weekend reading both volumes!
    His notation right at the beginning of Ch. XVI explains well why I was having
    trouble tracking down relevant information:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>English authorities
    for the history of Spanish typography from 1500 to 1800 are few. There appears
    to be no readily accessible survey of Spanish printing for the sixteenth, seventeenth,
    and eighteenth centuries, even in Spanish... In English there is little in the
    way of a continuous narrative, though Mr. H. Thomas's paper on <code>The Output
    of Spanish Books in the Sixteenth Century</code> (Transactions of the Bibliographical
    Society, Sept., 1920) may be consulted with advantage for this period.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nYour
    comment about there not being any type founders of significance in Spain before
    the mid 1700s was also summed up nicely by Updike:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>For Spanish
    printing, the seventeenth century was a discouraging period. The types in use
    were chiefly roman; the first edition of <code>Don Quixote</code> being printed
    from uncouth, old style roman fonts.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat pretty much explains
    it. I also found this passage amusing:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Spanish books of this
    period are much like the wretched productions of the Italian press\u2014with congested
    title-pages, composed in letters too large for the page, ill printed, and decorated
    (or at least supposed to be) with badly executed typographical ornaments. The
    type was generally a crude old style roman letter.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHa! Perfect!
    That suits my lack of book design skills perfectly! Sloppy, badly executed productions
    are my specialty! ;)\r\n\r\nThanks again for everything, folks. That gets me on
    the right path, indeed.\r\n"

    2011.\r\n\r\n<em>Daniel B. Updike, impresor e historiador de la tipograf\xEDa.</em>
    Valencia: Campgr\xE0fic, 2011.\r\n\r\nThe first is a general overview of type
    in Spain, which may be the first thing of its kind. Certainly the most comprehensive
    and carefully researched.\r\n\r\nThe study of Updike deals with his fascination,
    which became almost an obsession, with Spanish books and culture generally, and
    it includes a translation of the chapters on Spanish types from <em>Printing Types</em>,
    with a long introduction and a commentary. Updike put together one of the best
    collections of early Spanish type specimens made by any private collector, and
    he went on adding to it after the first edition of his book was published. They
    are now among the Updike materials in the special collections of the Public Library
    at Providence, RI.\r\n\r\nIf you want more detail, there is Albert Corbeto\u2019s
