For example, one of the entries in Bukvaraz was just disqualified because it was based on Stone Sans. I don't know exactly what line the designer took, but to me the result is so different that it's almost a moot point. Nobody would use that font instead of Stone Sans.

		<div class="commentbody">hallo jaques, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->i've done a few font modifications for clients of mine and have been wondering about the legal issues as well. so i asked the AGD (Alliance of German Designers). they reccomend, that you ask the creator of the original design if its OK with him/her, before starting on the modification. you and your clients definately need to purchase the proper licenses of the original font. make sure your client has done this before delivering and charging your modifications. i think you can also rename the font you've modified as long as you keep the original copyright infos included in the font's database. if the designer of a font that you want to modify isn't alive anymore, you'll have to go through the trouble of finding out who inherited the rights. in germany, the copyrights of a design remain valid until at least 70 years post mortem. i'm not sure if they can be extended after that. so, as long as the designer or the owner of the copyright says GO, there shouldn't be a legal or ethical problem, unless you or your client redistribute or give away the modified typeface. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->simon</div>
