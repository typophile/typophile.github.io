body: Is there anyway to fix positioning of diacritics in Nastaleeq. Normally, with
  changes in the glyph shapes, diacritics mess up. Avoiding their use is not always
  possible. Any guidance would be a favor.

  body: Use OpenType GPOS mark anchors, that should give you enough control over placement
    of "diacritics" on any glyph.

  body: "This is a kerning issue. You need to provide kerning between the word that
    contains the Yeh Barri and the \"Space\" character that comes before the word,
    as well as the letters that do not connect on the left like Alef.fina, Dal, Reh,
    and Waw. \r\n\r\nThere may be easier ways to do this, but here is one approach
    to the problem. I make groups of the letters, or letter combinations, that come
    before Yeh Barri based on how wide they are. When the width of such letters, or
    groups of letters, is more than the Yeh Barri tail extension to the right, I provide
    appropriate kerning as needed between the first of the connecting letters and
    the Space character that comes before it. \r\n\r\nThe number of such kerning lookups,
    the type of adjustment, and what context to use in these lookups, will depend
    on the particular design of your font."
