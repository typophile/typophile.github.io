body: "Hi there,\r\nI wondered what website fonts might look good for an internet
  site. I tried Fakt (Opentype) on one website and I feel it looks better than Arial.
  ( in case you want to have a look: http://info-buddhismus.de )\r\n\r\nFor 2 other
  websites I was thinking maybe I use another opentype font which can be included
  directly via the @font-face CSS rule. But I checked with Museo Sans or Calluna Sans
  and it does not look good at all.\r\n\r\nAny idea which Font might work well? Verdana
  and Arial/Helvetica seem to be still the better choice. Also any example or link
  to a site which uses a well working font (being easy to read and also looking good)
  would be welcomed.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find a discussion thread about this topic on
  typohile, so I started this one. In case there is one already, please let me know
  and I do apologize.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks. \r\n\r\nMaybe I turn back to Arial or Verdana. Verdana seems to be
    the most legible font for web purposes. Actual it is a trial to use Fakt. Ourtype
    licence includes that a font from their foundry can be used also on 1 website,
    so I used it now instead of Arial, and felt it looks better than Arial.\r\n\r\nI
    wait a bit if there is input from others too."

    This is a huge topic, and there have been many post here in the past. Try [[http://www.google.no/search?q=site%3Atypophile.com+%40font-face&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:nb-NO:official&client=firefox-a|this
    google search]].\r\n\r\nIn short: Both Arial and Verdana has had months (years?)
    worth of coding and nudging to help the computer interpret it\u2019s curves as
    pixels. This is called hinting. Verdana is probably the best hinted font out there.
    Most of the new web fonts will not preform as good under all conditions, but some
    of them will look great in <em>most</em> conditions. Where do you start looking?

  body: I think that beneath a certain size, it's totally counterproductive to stray
    from the safe, well-hinted choices. There just isn't room at a height of twelve
    pixels for a typeface to distinguish itself without destroying color and readability.

  body: "Apetickler, I couldn't agree more (how's that for a funny sentence?).\r\n\r\nAlways
    test your website on Windows XP with default settings (with multiple browsers,
    and of course other OSes too). You will be surprised at how awful most webfonts
    look at smaller sizes. Here are some estimates of OS market share:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_os.asp\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems\r\n\r\nTypekit
    has a feature called \"Browser Samples\" that shows screenshots of their web fonts
    on various OS/browser combos at different sizes. Most of the fonts tend to become
    legible around 18px and larger, which \"coincidentally\" is the size at which
    Georgia and Verdana switch to anti-aliased (on Windows anyway).\r\n"

  body: "Thank you very much for your good advice and thoughts!\r\n\r\nI reverted
    the settings and try it now with the users' system fonts of Lucida Sans and Arial.
    The Lucida Sans seems to work well on Mac Browsers but not on Windows. Typedia
    (which was linked by frode Frank) uses Lucida Sans. I do not know if this font
    is a hand hinted font-any idea?\r\n\r\nVerdana is too wide for the site, I needed
    a bit of a narrower sans serif.\r\n\r\nQuite likely I will experiment a bit with
    the font, your input led me into a good direction, so thank you all! If there
    are too many problems with the different systems and browsers I just use mere
    Arial again.\r\n\r\n(In case someone has to say anything about using Lucida Sans
    for websites, please let me know.)"

    italics though, and it isn\u2019t available on most mobile devices.\r\n\r\nVerdana
    is a rather wide (read up on the design process if you want to understand why)
    humanist sans serif. Some more \u201Cnormal\u201D width humanist web fonts include:
    Frutiger, Compatil Fact, Syntax (the fonts.com website is a bitch to navigate,
    giving up at this point but please do look further!) Droid Sans Pro, FF Kievit,
    FF Milo, FF Scala and there\u2019s also FF Unit which is rather narrow IMO. Typotheque
    offers Fedra Sans Screen, but I personally think they went a bit too far with
    that one: it really suffers on a Mac, but look splendid in Windows.\r\n\r\nYou
    can pick up some info on the hinting quality of Lucida Grande & Sans (Unicode)
    [[http://www.typophile.com/node/29822|here]]. I can say for sure that many designers
    use Mac and often forget about the end users that usually sits on another platform."
