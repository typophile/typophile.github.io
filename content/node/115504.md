body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have tons of problem with Fontlab 5.1.2 on Mavericks and my
  intuos wacom tablet. This is very hard to work with as the tablet does not respond
  to the commands. When you click a glyphs it would select another. When you click
  a point it will randomly moves the window space. I know there are some threads around
  the web talking about these issues. But I cannot find any solutions. Anyone might
  have resolve these wacom bugs ?"

  body: Huh. Although the site says 5.1.2 is the latest, I am pretty sure I have a
    5.1.4; maybe it was still pre-release and hasn't shipped.

  body: For me, downgrading the wacom driver to an older version did the trick. I
    have a different model of tablet, so I guess you have to try the older drivers
    for yours and see if it works.

    \r\nWhen I plugged in mouse it worked well. Every now and than when it doesn't
    jump from magnifier back to cursor, I click mouse end it works. I'm using Intiuos
    4."
