  one had answered the original poster's request to identify this font, so I just
  thought I'd try here : http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3514/3895680663_d75b9b7948.jpg\r\n\r\nWhat
  is the \"London Calling\" font? Anything similar to recommend if it's hand-drawn
  or too difficult to identify?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    a similar script \r\ndue to style differences, but I think you can try the following:\r\n\r\nPea

    chalk sound\r\n\r\n"
