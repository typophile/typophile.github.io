  Opening and ceramics sale!\r\n\r\nJust in time for summer, YSLTT is officially open.
  Come enjoy a variety of type related sculptures and projects. YSLTT exists to inspire,
  educate, and develop type appreciation through the use of art, public intervention,
  graffiti, and the internet.\r\n\r\nDue to an impending move and retirement from
  the ceramic studio, a custom letter sale is being offered. You submit the letter
  and choose between 2 in or 4 inch sizes and slick matte white or sexy matte chocolate
  colors. These letters are the perfect scale to make a striking addition to your
  desktop or bookcase; they also make great gifts.\r\n\r\nSee the <a href=\"http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/enjoy/shoppe\">shoppe</a>
  for more information.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting and please enjoy your stay at
  <a href=\"http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com\">You Should Like Type Too .com</a>."

    one of your PDAs in Trafalgar! There I am in a picture. I had just been looking
    at the platelet letters, i didn't take any tho. I went back there like 10 minutes
    later and there was only that broken part left. That was a bummer, but hey, it
    is cool that I know where they came from now. \r\n\r\nashton\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/me_3643.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks Ashton. Us typophiles are such a sparse group that the odds of randomly
    bumping into each other is probably slim. That is too bad in the case of these
    small letter exhibits because you are the real people who would appreciate them
    for what they are. While I would hope they find there way into a good home, and
    a type nut would provide that, it also seems important to me to get new people
    interested in, or at least get them to look at, type. That being said, keep a
    watch around TypeCon because it seems like a great place for some more letters
    to pop up.\r\n"
