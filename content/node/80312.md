  body: "I've put up testing web sites with very obscure addresses that no human could
    find, yet the spammers are always able to find them and write very complimentary
    blog comments on those sites telling me how great my articles are. The article
    writing they compliment is complete \"lorem ipsum dolor\" style gibberish, and
    they always add a few spammer style links within their blog comments to sites
    for Viagra, or gold sales, or some other non-sense. And I'm sure they have scripts
    that write those same comments on a multitude of sites. Without protection, spammers
    will find and abuse any form of web communication.\r\n\r\nOne of the simple ways
    to thwart the spammers using automated tools is the CAPTCHA:\r\n<blockquote>\"CAPTCHAs,
    or Completely Automated Public Turing Tests to Tell Computers and Humans Apart,
    exist to ensure that user input has not been generated by a computer. These peculiar
    puzzles are commonly used on the Web to protect registration and comment forms
    from spam. To be honest, I have mixed feelings about CAPTCHAs. They have annoyed
    me on many occasions, but I\u2019ve also implemented them as quick fixes on websites.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSource:

  body: "This isn't really a typography nor visual design question nor marketing,
    but...\r\n\r\nWe don't need CAPTCHAs. But we use them to be pragmatic when we
    don't have the technical or human resources to handle the issues associated with
    not using them on the back-end.\r\n\r\nA CAPTCHA, as stated, is an attempted way
    to determine that the web form is being filled out by a human rather than an automated
    script. It does this on the client side, meaning the onus is on the customer to
    pass the test as opposed to handling this on the server side, which can be more
    effort.\r\n\r\nGeneral rule of thumb is to avoid them at all costs from a user
    experience perspective. People hate them. Only use them if there simply isn't
    another solution available. "

    the designer was reCAPTCHA. All the other ones seem to punish legit users more
    than the spammers. '

  body: "CAPTCHAs reduce the effectiveness of every form they are on by significant
    percentages. There are alternatives, such as Akismet, and in my opinion they are
    worth it even if the odd spam bot still manages to get through.\r\n\r\nI would
    rather manually remove occasional spam than lose 20% of my registrations or sales
    to have a CAPTCHA."
