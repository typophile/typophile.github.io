  \"p\" that looks like this before. \r\nIt's from a danish book from the 40's (I
  think). Any thoughts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oldirty_5089.jpg]"

    which I know was designed later than your date, but seems to include all the same
    details, at first glance. Maybe he based it on the typeface used in your book.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "In my old Jaspert Encyclopedia there is a showing of the bold of this, called
    'Nordische Antiqua'. It is ascribed to Genzsch & Heyse, also Linotype. So probably
    if you want the original maybe you could hunt it down in old catalogues with Genzsch
    & Heyse type. \r\n\r\nIt looks Goudy influenced to me. "

    Berndal pages</a> from the Klingspor Museum, seems to show the connection to the
    Genzsch & Heyse Antiqua for the Bold, even though they did not use the name 'Nordische'.
    The Jaspert sample does have features like the Nordik Bold.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Yes, I was also thinking Goudy.\r\n \r\nAnd now Nordich Antqua rings a bell,
    And I just found it in one of Berlingska Type Foundry specimens as Nordisk Antikva
    (Nordic Antiqua).\r\n\r\nValter Falks book \" Bokstavsformer och typsnitt genom
    tiderna\", says it was drawn by Friedrich Bauer at Genzsch & Heyse. Adviser in
    the making of the typeface was swedish bokprinter Waldmar Zachrisson.\r\n\r\nThansk
    for the help. The answer was 50 cm away. "

  body: "First used in 1906 in Waldmar Zachrisson's \"WZ:s boktryckerikskalender 1905-1906\".\r\nOnly
    oine grade/size was ready by then. Took 2 years to make. Versiosn for Intertype
    and Typograph was also made. In Germany known as Genzsch Antikva.\r\n\r\nInspiration
    = Plantin\r\n\r\nThere's almost half a chapter about this typeface.\r\n\r\nAccording
    to this book \"Nordische Antiqua\" is a new cut made by Linotype in 1920,\r\nBUT
    not of the Nordisk Antikva, but of Deberny & Cie's \"Romain no 16\" imported by
    Genzsch & Heyse in 1882 (and then they did some rework on it).'\r\n\r\n"
