body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nIf you would be so kind as to take a quick look at my resume
  and critique it for me that would be great. I would love some constructive criticism
  if you have it. \r\n\r\nA little background information: It is build on a 32 point
  grid, typeface is Georgia 10pt size with 14pt leading.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone!\r\n\r\nEdit:
  I've edited it more to specific content and added some more work description. I
  unfortunately don't have much recognition or related personal experience related
  to design just yet. Would personal experience be considered volunteer work? The
  engineers without borders project as a volunteer project for free."

  body: " A few things. \r\n\r\n1) Under the education heading, lose the high school
    history. It doesn't pertain to a professional level job. I would also list only
    your major/emphasis under college history. Axe the college class list as well.
    If an employer wants to see a transcript, they'll ask for it. \r\n\r\n2) If you
    have any freelance design experience or an internship, I would list it under work
    experience. There seems to be a definite lack of real world design experience
    in this section. \r\n\r\nYou may also want to reword your job descriptions as
    they relate to the design world. Deadlines, customer relations, communication,
    and general organization are all good things to think about. \r\n\r\nPersonal
    anecdote: When I was a student, I worked in a luggage store of all things. Very
    far from the design world. My saving grace was that I had a lot of experience
    embossing leather goods at the store (we had a 100-year-old embossing machine).
    This impressed my current employer in the sense that it used good typographic
    and hand skills. That, and the fact that you had very little recourse if you fucked
    up a $2,000 piece of luggage.\r\n\r\n3)  I might lose the recognition portion
    of the resume (seems fluffy) and replace it with a personal experience section.
    Are you bilingual by chance? Have you traveled or studied abroad? Things to think
    about.\r\n\r\nLastly, proofread your resume. You have a few typos and punctuation
    mistakes, but I won't tell you where they are.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOGG

  body: "Hey Dogg,\r\n\r\nUnfortunatley I have extremely little experience with actual
    design jobs, the purpose of this is to actual acquire an internship which is required
    by my schooling. I appreciate the in depth feedback and will use it wisely.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nI would scoot all the content more to left to make it look
    centered... that ones up to you.\r\n\r\nBut for sure I would make the body text
    black and the headings and sub-heads grey. In fact, you may want to try a bold
    black instead of grey.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "Hi nein,\r\n\r\nQuick suggestion, I've started using www.Razume.com for resume
    review, you can post your pdf resume anonymously and get community feedback directly
    on your resume, it's pretty cool.  I got some great advice.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    your resume's pretty good.  I would remove the bottom part about references, it
    just takes up room.  Recruiters will ask for references if they want them regardless
    if you have it listed.  Also, try quantifying your resume more.  Use numbers,
    amount of time, $ amounts to describe your work experience in more detail.\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck,\r\nHenry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
