  Maybe for the starting traditionalism of the period? and which was the most famous
  revived typefaces?\r\nthanks for the answers!"

    1900? </em>\r\n\r\nIt was a way to bring order and quality to the messy new media
    of the 1890s.\r\nThe Arts & Crafts style used by private presses, influenced by
    Morris's Kelmscott Press, was taken up by the mainstream.\r\nIt was receptive
    because at the time there was no concept of \"modernism\" as we understand it,
    and historicism was a new idea.\r\nHistoricism appealed to the widespread Progressive
    ideals of the era, because many people were pissed off with the nasty side-effects
    of a century of industrialization, and idealized the time before -- long before.\r\nHistoricism
    was not just type design, but layout and illustration too.\r\n\r\nHowever, the
    two most successful \"old\" faces in America in the 1900s were not revivals: Cheltenham
    and Kennerley.\r\n\r\n\"Jenson\" was the first and most famous revived face: many
    type designers wanted to reinterpret the<em> fons et origo</em> of the roman typeface:
    Morris' Golden Type, Benton's Cloister, Rogers' Centaur. There is a lot of Jenson
    in Kennerley, too.\r\n\r\n<em>The Origins of Graphic Design in America 1870-1920</em>,
    by Helen Mazur Thomson, tells the story.\r\n"

  body: "<em> ... archive ...</em>\r\n\r\nThat reminds me of the situation at ATF
    where, following the merger, a vast library of historical specimens was aggregated,
    then put in a library by Henry Bullen, where it became a resource for Morris Benton
    and other ATF personnel.\r\n\r\nRegarding the pantograph and history mining, it
    enabled a new class of designers, independents such as Fred Goudy, to prepare
    working drawings for typefaces, getting deeper into the minutiae of the design
    process than during the days of punch-cutting. (An earlier precedent may have
    been wood type.) \r\n\r\nGoudy, De Vinne, Updike, Cleland, Bradley, Rogers, all
    those folk were bibliophiles and members of organizations such as the Grolier
    Club, of which De Vinne was one of the founders."

  body: "I think a lot of the effort was due to the technological change around 1890.
    There was not only the pantographic punch cutter, which was critical, but also
    Linotype and Monotype, which necessitated recutting all faces for them. The ease
    of producing many sizes that the Pantographic Punch Cutter enables was an important
    force in the efforts of Morris Fuller Benton at ATF.\r\n\r\nOf course there was
    also a fashion change, a tiring of the extremes of Victorian design, and a taste
    for the more classic coming back. \r\n"
