body: So, I'm doing a mural in an orthodontist office. They want the company logo
  somewhere on the painting; however, I have no idea what font their logo is....and
  it seems as though they don't either. I'm sure this is a standard font, but I know
  next to nothing about typography. If someone could help me out with this I would
  be most thankful!
