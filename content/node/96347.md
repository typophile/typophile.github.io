body: "Well, technically number spacing. I'm working on a project that involves the
  design of a very post-modern elevator panel, which, as you can see, has been set
  in Gotham (with counters filled) on a diagonal grid. Within each cell, the idea
  is that the letters are right-aligned and intersect with the bottom edge:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elevator_panel_original_5535.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  problem is the 1/4/7 column. Every other number has a relatively even, boxy shape
  that was easy to center. But my original plan was to align the right edge of 1,
  4, 7 with each other vertically, then raise them to the same vertical height as
  the midpoint of the other numbers in their respective rows. My thinking is illustrated
  here:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elevator_panel_original_lines_5504.png]\r\n\r\nWhile
  this makes some sense logically, the result (as seen in the first image) clearly
  doesn't look right. The 7 in particular has an awkward amount of negative space
  that isn't being addressed at all. To rectify this, I've created a new layout that
  moves the 1 and the 4 up a bit higher and pushes the 7 back to compensate for all
  the space:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elevator_panel_fixed_4560.png]\r\n\r\nAt
  this point though, I don't trust my eyes and am just looking for some fresh-eyed
  feedback. Any input you might have on the fixed version of the layout would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Have you tried to use slanted numbers and bringing them upright? I\u2019m
    not fully convinced about the top situation of 1, 3, 5, 4 an 7. Especially the
    different parallels of the slanted shape and the 1. 4 would need to be redrawn,
    especially the situation below right is unsatisfying. I would pull down the 7
    more out of the shape. And overall i find the deleted counters not a good treatment,
    because thus some numerals tend to be more important than others. And is there
    a zero floor?"

    it seems. Also the filled counters throw off the balance of the numbers with one

  body: "Awesome, thanks so much for the feedback guys. As always it's much appreciated.\r\n\r\nTo
    provide a little perspective, I've uploaded a picture of how this layout is actually
    being used in the \"real\" elevator environment:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elevator_panel_rendered_3682.png]\r\n\r\nWith
    this image in mind, I'd like to respond to the comments so far. And I apologize
    in advance; I'm sure this will all sound like very transparent rationalization
    and excuse-making. :)\r\n\r\n1) The counters aren't being filled in for a stylistic
    reason, or at least not for a \"directly\" stylistic reason. As I think is clearer
    in the supplied image, the buttons are intended to have a very industrial, precision-machined
    feel to them, and casting them in a single piece of metal conveys that better
    than including separate, floating pieces in the counters. With the metal finish
    and the backlighting behind each button, I hope this looks more like a deliberate
    decision on a manufacturing level, if not a typographical one.\r\n\r\n2) I really
    appreciate the version of the layout with the skewed numerals. I agree, the layout
    is much more stable and consistent that way, and certainly easier to align/balance.
    Ultimately, though, one of my favorite parts of the diagonal buttons is the way
    the non-diagonal numerals contrast in their directions; alignment headaches aside,
    I think the vertical numerals generate interesting intersections with the angled
    edges of the buttons. The numbers almost appear to be \"emerging\" or \"rising
    up\" from the bottom of the buttons, rather than \"sinking\" along with them.
    For an elevator, I think this is an appropriate connotation.\r\n\r\nAlso, on a
    purely optical level, I want to avoid the typical artifacts that affect the curves
    of algorithmically skewed letterforms.\r\n\r\n3) William's comment about the right
    alignment being problematic and unnecessary is true and not really one I can argue
    against. However, this was another case where I found the center alignment a bit
    bland (with the exception of \"HELP\", where it was simply unavoidable and, in
    my opinion, an acceptable exception since it's the one non-numeral). The right
    alignment, which I agree is a minefield and not hugely obvious in its necessity,
    ties back into the underlying elevator notion of up/down motion; my intent was
    to create a sense of lift in each letter, and by pushing the numerals to the highest
    point within each button (which just happens to be the right side), I think I
    capture a little more of that. In a lot of ways they almost resemble a person
    riding an escalator, which isn't EXACTLY appropriate for an elevator, but close
    enough. :)\r\n\r\nIn other words, everything above is my way of saying that while
    I agree with all the practical and aesthetic arguments against the layout, these
    decisions play too heavy a role in my conception of the elevator concept to abandon,
    leaving me no choice but to make the best of them. So I've made some slight modifications
    to the 1/4/7 column that I think balance things out about as well as can be expected
    given the admittedly stubborn requirements listed above. In particular, the /1/
    and /4/ numerals are now centered with the /7/ beneath them.\r\n\r\nThere's probably
    still a lot to nitpick about the exact placement of everything, but I think overall
    this works well enough. Considering how awkward the premise of the layout is to
    begin with, \"good enough\" seems acceptable to me.\r\n\r\nLastly, you'll notice
    that unlike the buttons, the array of 7-segment displays (the digits on the screen)
    is slanted along with the shape of the screen itself. This is arguably a pretty
    blatant inconsistency, so I'm going to experiment with a non-slanted version.
    (I just wanted to point that out preemptively :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, this process was
    extremely helpful, even if we don't have the same ultimate opinion on things,
    so thanks again! I really do appreciate the feedback either way. Additional commentary
    is still welcome, btw."

  body: "I certainly didn't say anything was or is perfect. Quite the opposite, in
    fact; my whole point was that it's a very awkward premise to begin with and there
    was probably never going to be a perfect way to balance my own ideas for the design
    with the more typographically graceful solutions you guys provided. But I still
    wanted to give it a shot and at least know for sure. That's why I said that even
    though I ultimately more or less stuck with the design I had, I still found this
    process very valuable.\r\n\r\nAnd come on, I love Typophile, but this would be
    a very odd way to \"exhibit\" my work if that's what I were after."

    You could consider to take the italic and skew it slightly to get the right angle.
    The visual distortion you then get will only be a few degrees. Much less then
    when you take the roman and skew it to the desired angle."
