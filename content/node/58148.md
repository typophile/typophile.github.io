body: "I'm not sure about posting this on this site is right, since\r\nyour about
  typo not logos but i'd like opinion about\r\nmy logo. My 2d logo was created almost
  10 years\r\nago, it was created with a program by Adobe (i don't\r\nrember the name)
  who made vector 3d and was much\r\nbetter than the 3d function added to Illustrator.\r\nSo
  basically my logo is a circle-thing mapped on a top\r\nof a sphere. With cinema4d,
  added dimention to this\r\nflat logo.\r\n\r\nwich one do you prefer? (and why if
  your kind)\r\nthx\r\n"

  body: "I actually prefer the lefty2.jpg\r\nIt is traditionally 'correct' in respect
    to the laws of logo design.\r\nIt scales well, its simple but eye catching. Its
    truly beautiful.\r\nLess is more and just because gradients and three dimensional
    bells and whistles are sexy it doesn't mean they're practical. Imagine the 3d
    version at the top of a letter head photocopied three times over in black and
    white and then faxed across the country.\r\nThe lefty2 would retain a true to
    form image.\r\nAs it should.\r\nIt's wonderful."

  body: "Thanks for your answer. actually i only use the 3d logo for my Keynote presentation
    (PowerPoint if your PC) as a 3d looping animation for between two chapters and
    i wanted to try it in some flash real time 3d engine.\r\nI have a friend who is
    1000 times better than me in 3d and we are working on a new version that respect
    better the 2d logo.\r\ni do a very little 3d, he is a specialist. I'll post here
    the new project when it's done, but now we have very little time to consume\r\non
    this - not really important - project.\r\n\r\n@Ratbaggy: you maybe right, but
    for motion design it helps a lot."

  body: I prefer a simpler, subtler approach. This last one you posted just says you
    have a decent renderer on your machine. (Basically I like the one you're using
    as your avatar over this one).

  body: "This 3d thing is not made to replace the 2d logo (i love it too much). but
    for example if you take only the alpha channel of the first image you basically
    have my 2d logo. It's not perfect but good enough to have fun with After Effect,so
    i can animate my logo and have fun with it. I don't know if i will ever use it
    for real, this is experimental.. i do 3d when i need to change idea because i'm
    stuck in other projects i don't really look forward that way for my job except
    for animations :P \r\nand the (gold) texture with reflect is the better way to
    see the default of the model, i don't want to have a GOLD logo OMG no!! :D"
