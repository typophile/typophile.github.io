  body: "lowercase 'o' could use some overshoot\r\nuppercase 'R' needs some weight
    and width\r\nuppercase 'W' could lose some weight\r\n\r\nObviously not a text
    font, so your quirkiness could be more pronounced.\r\nWhy not be more daring?"

  body: By the way, I would like to mention that I had no idea what I was doing going
    into this, as my typography teacher is really just a graphic designer who provided
    zero material on the actual creation of a font, and when asked about some basic
    type elements I've learned here, said there were no guidelines for creating a
    typeface. *facepalm*
