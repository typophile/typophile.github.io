    a type designer. It&#39;s basically intended to help people decide if it&#39;s
    something they should jump into or not; what to expect in the nether regions of
    the craft. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'Here&#39;s what NOT to do: go to <a href="http://www.stoutbooks.com/">William
    Stout Architectural Books</a> at 804 Montgomery St. Last time I was there, I got
    Alan Bartram&#39;s <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300090587">Five
    hundred years of book design</a></i>, Peter Burnhill&#39;s <i><a href="http://youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=P0226">Type
    Spaces</a></i>, two of Keith Smith&#39;s binding books, and a huge whack of other
    stuff. They also have copies of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0500019428">full-sized
    edition</a> of the translation of <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphilia</i> that  has
    to be seen to be believed. That place has been horrendous for my credit card.
    It&#39;s the best bookstore I&#39;ve found for new design and architecture titles
    &#40;although their selection of stuff on Daniel Libeskind is strangely deficient,
    given how much work he&#39;s done in SF&#41;. <BR> <BR>Gang of Four is playing
    the Fillmore the evening of the 2nd. If that&#39;s the night of your talk, you
    could go to the show afterwards! It&#39;s gonna be hot! <BR> <BR>Also, you should
    get some sushi. I suggest Takara in Japantown &#40;with a stop at Kinokuniya to
    flip through the copies of Idea and Relax&#41; or Ryoko&#39;s in the Tenderloin.
    Not as trendy as some of the other places people mention &#40;Blowfish, Ebisu&#41;
    but amazing fish. <BR> <BR>And you should check out some of San Francisco&#39;s
    bizarre little parks. My favorites are the south peak of Twin Peaks &#40;i.e.
    not the one where all the tour buses go&#41; and Golden Gate Heights. <BR> <BR>Really,
    I could do this all day. What are you looking to do?'

  body: 'Sushi wise, I&#39;m partial to Akiko&#39;s on Bush St., Ariake on Geary Blvd.,
    and Murasaki on Clement St. &#40;in the Inner Richmond district&#41;, but then
    Murasaki is my preferred neighborhood sushi place, being just down the street
    from my apartment. <BR> <BR>I suggest a San Francisco Typophile Dinner take place,
    maybe after your talk, or just during your visit. Who&#39;s game? I&#39;ll throw
    out a potential dining place to start things off: Korean Village Restaurant on
    Geary Blvd. in the Inner Richmond. Great Korean food, which I selfishly admit
    I can&#39;t get enough of right now.'

    <BR>&#62; sushi <BR> <BR>I thought all the sushi joints were converted to Dennys
    after the internet implosion... ;-&#41; <BR>Seriously, I&#39;m so up for sushi,
    any time. <BR> <BR>Dan, if you guys plan something, I&#39;m there. I&#39;ll be
    coming in Sunday afternoon, my talk is Monday at 6:30pm, and I&#39;ll be heading
    back before noon on Tuesday. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'As a design student/aspiring type designer in NYC, I am very interested in
    the topic of your talk, although unfortunately I cannot attend that or your summer
    class at Art Center. It would be wonderful if you could post the text or an outline
    afterwards. Some questions I have are: <BR> <BR>How important are traditional
    drawing skills? Would you suggest putting in lots of time tracing, hand-lettering,
    and learning calligraphy? <BR> <BR>How much do you need to learn about all the
    other typefaces out there, and the nuances of optical adjustments, etc. before
    you create your own? Just do it? What if you end up with something derivative?
    <BR> <BR>What technical knowledge is needed? Should we all become Python programmers?
    <BR> <BR>How do you make a living? Designing type on the side while working another
    job, or working for a foundry? <BR> <BR>It seems as if there is a continuum of
    type design: one end deals with technical computer stuff like coding for OpenType
    and the other is more traditional and craft-oriented, like creating beautiful
    hand-lettering. And then there is the curatorial side'

  body: Good questions! I&#39;ll try to answer them after the talk - I&#39;ll have
    improved my own outlook as a result too. Thanks for the interest. <BR> <BR>hhp
