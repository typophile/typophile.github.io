body: Hello - I&#39;m new to this forum having discovered it while searching for information
  on InDesign ME. <BR> <BR>I do a large amount of non-English setting work including
  a fair amount oof Arabic and Hebrew. Until now I have used Quark and the Phonyx
  XTension, as well as a similar self-built system for Hebrew, using mirrored fonts
  and a lot of faffing around dealing with reveresed character sequences for Left-Right
  reading text. <BR> <BR>InDesign has gradually been building up on my worklist and
  I&#39;ve been half dreading the first Hebrew job and half looking forward to it.
  I&#39;ve considered using similar mirrored fonts and mirrored text boxes for a forthcoming
  job, but I have a little lead time and would really like to start doing it properly,
  so I&#39;m considering purchasing InDesign ME. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to know what
  other users have experienced with this program, especially with regards to its directional
  behaviour and what methods of input can be used &#40;both typing and pulling in
  external files&#41;. <BR> <BR>Are there any gotchas which I may not have considered?
  <BR>All opinions gratefully received.

  body: I have been using InDesign ME for a little more than a year, and enthusiastically
    recommend it. The bidirectional text controls are very good, and -- on Windows
    at least -- a variety of input methods are well supported including system keyboards,
    import from Office docs and other text formats, and copy-paste &#40;the latter
    may not always work, but seems more reliable for non-Western text than regular
    InDesign. The WinSoft developers have also gone to great lengths to ensure that
    a wide varuety of legacy 8-bit encodings for Arabic are supported, as well as
    the preferred Unicode encoding. <BR> <BR>OpenType GPOS mark positioning is supported
    -- in addition to a couple of other, cruder methods --, and you can also manually
    adjust the position of marks. The program has the best control I&#39;ve seen for
    Arabic and Hebrew vowel marking. <BR> <BR>My only real complaint is that the current
    releases do not support contextual mark positioning, which means that I can&#39;t
    use it for Biblical Hebrew without a lot of manual positioning adjustment.

      Biblical Hebrew has been solved or if there are any other solutions?

  body: '&#62;=20 &#62;=20 &#62;=20 &#62; Thanks for that, John =AD it does look like
    it does what=B9s needed and in th= e &#62; proper way. &#62;=20 &#62; Of course,
    I forgot entirely to mention that I=B9m operating on Mac OS X =AD = but &#62;
    the coding support looks good to me. &#62;=20 &#62; Out of interest, what happens
    when a standard copy of InDesign is used to= open &#62; an ME files with bi-directional
    content? &#62;=20 &#62; ... And is it right that the current version number stands
    at 2, rather t= han &#62; CS? =20 &#62;=20 &#62;=20 &#62;=20'

  body: If you open an ID ME file with bidi text in regular InDesign, you get a warning
    message that the file contains material associated with the ME text layout plugin.
    If I remember correctly, you have the option to remove the association and open
    the file anyway, in which case I presume the text order is messed up. <BR> <BR>Yes,
    I think ID ME is still at version 2.0. The CS version was being beta tested very
    recently -- I was unable to take part because I didn&#39;t have time -- so it
    is presumably fairly close to release.
