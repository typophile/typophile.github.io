		<div class="commentbody">Grandjean (Romain du Roi) was digitised by Franck Jalleau in 1995-1997 for the Imprimerie Nationale. Don't know if it's available to buy.

I would love to see, among other things, a digitisation of Touraine by Cassandre (Deberny & Peignot, 1947) or its lookalike Chambord by Excoffon (Olive, 1945-1951). Both can be seen in Jaspert, Berry & Johnson's Encycl. of Typefaces. Nicely post-deco and not quite as bizarre and dogmatic as Peignot.

Very much looking forward to the digitisation of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=37115">Ronaldson</a> (MS&J, 1884), soon to be completed by Rebecca Alaccari (Canadatype). Not really what you would call a classic, but there's nothing quite like it around anymore, and surprisingly comfortable as a textface despite unclassical letterforms.</div>

Grandjean had to change it because the details were more or less unfeasible in metal type, of course, whereas a digital version could be absolutely true. But at text size we would also see how well it works optically as it is. And probably have to agree with some of Grandjean's changes. First problems in sight: the skinny lowercase g and y.

DTL has the rights on van Krimpen's designs, including lots of original drawings (for which, it seems, they paid a high price). The attempt is to digitise and revive JvK's oeuvre: http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/VanKrimpen.html.

Werzat?

True, but I also think it was as much a stylistic imposition on his part. He shouldn't have done it. It's not like the world had a dearth of conventional italics.

> symmetrically-seriffed ascenders

I remember JFP also objecting to that, to the point of ridicule. But I see the positive in it: not only does it express a grand style ahead of its time (note how liked Democratica became centuries later) but I think they actually help readability (by reinforcing extenders). Which is not to say I think the RdR is highly readable overall.

> it’s not all too clear who the present owner is.

If a good effort at research validates this ambiguity, then I personally see the free third-party revival of the design as contingent only upon the informal blessing of De Roos's heir (unless he's unreasonable to the point of misanthropy, in which case I would ignore him). As a point of courtesy protocol however I would inform competing potential revivers of the decision.

Actually your example of Maximum A made me think that this type has another name in the English speaking world. It looks familiar – does anyone else agree?

Other types on the wish list to be revived? Er, the Doves Type? (1900, T.J. Cobden Sanderson, Emery Walker, Edward Prince, Doves Press) or have we had this old chestnut already? Monotype Condensa? (designer unknown? date unknown?) The full family of Erbar Grotesk, not just the condensed version. Every time I look through an older specimen books I see stuff that I'm pretty sure has not yet been revived, but everytime I go online I get the opposite feeling!

Or, coming back to De Roos, the Hollandse Mediaeval (1912, Sjoerd H. De Roos, Lettergieterij Amsterdam/Intertype) with its decorated initials...

As for De Roos: only his eponymous typeface is really worth mentioning. The Hollandsche Mediaevaal is of historical interest because of its widespread use in the Netherlands and Flanders, and, of course, for its being the first Dutch design since Fleischman, but it's an ungainly thing.

		<div class="commentbody">A question to you all:
What about the copyrights?
Lots of the old german fonts are still belonging to someone.
In my font collection I have some hundreds of examples of german fonts and all are scanned in low reselution and high res for a print-project what we'll start in 2007.

Is it legal to offer and to use high res scans for typographists to revive these fonts? (Not only by law but although from an ethic standpoint).

Please let me know.

Here is my font collection - all classified by DIN 16 518

		<div class="commentbody">Georg — There is no problem with publishing specimens. After all, fonts are meant to be used in printing or other publishing projects, right? What others intend to do with those publications is something different, for that matter. For a digital revival, legally one would have to acquire the proper rights from the present owners, I guess, if the designs and/or names are not in the public domain already. How is Dipl.-Ing. Menzel managing the rights issue? http://www.romana-hamburg.de/fraktur1.htm

I suggest you take contact with the Bund für deutsche Schrift und Sprache. They published an interesting book with specimens of 114 German types, most of it Fraktur: Wolfgang Hendlmeier (ed.), <cite>Kunstwerke der Schrift.</cite> Gedichte und Sinnsprüche im Kleide schöner Druckschriften aus sechs Jahrhunderten, Bayreuth: Bund für deutsche Schrift und Sprache, 1994.

Reviving typefaces of typographic interest, is imho always ethically right. If the designer is still alive, it makes no sense to "revive" a typeface of his; plagiarising his design would be robbery. If he's passed away, I think his children should benefit from their father's labour, to a certain extent. But if some clever boys managed to get hold of someone else's intellectual property, making money out of it by acting as monopolists, denying mankind access to its cultural heritage, ignoring these mercantile stolen "rights" is not only ethically correct, it's a moral obligation.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Georg, "genial" was too strong a term - sorry. I was rushed - normally I use that term very rarely - but instead of editing it and making your post confusing I've just asterisked it.

That said:
1) Nobody's perfect, and the more type you make the more likely you'll end up with a lemon or two.
2) Making money sometimes or even often (some would even say usually) does not preclude being intelligent, insightful or culturally responsible.

Looking specifically at your two samples*, I would say:
1) Elegant-Grotesk is cute[r], but not really significant. And I can see plently of issues of craft in its forms.
2) National might have been overly nationalistic and/or mainstream when it was made, but right here right now it's more useful and interesting than Elegant-Grotesk.
3) If you feel that either of those (and specifically Elegant-Grotesk)  are more interesting and more worthy of revival than the Höhnisch sample I posted above, then we really are looking for very different things in type design.

* And assuming you meant to say "be aware", not "beware" above.

> There is no problem with publishing specimens.

Actually IIRC, P M Noordzij once told me (I have the email somewhere) that merely scanning a type sample and sending it to a friend is illegal in the Netherlands, much less "publishing" it. Of course, each country is different, but be careful of blanket statements.

		<div class="commentbody">I should have been more precise. Why do you use fonts? Right, to set type. Should that mean, with those fonts of which you legally purchased the user's license, you're supposed to set running text only (for which, of course, you or your client has the proper copyrights)? Are you not allowed to set <cite>and</cite> publish alphabets and such? Of course you are. Probably someone did this before, though, and he might have done so in a particular inventively new composition, of which he, the type specimen designer, is the rightful owner. You cannot simply steel his work and copy it right along. But is P.M. Noordzij or whoever now going to tell whether "The quick brown fox" or "Quousq; tandem" has been set already in, say, 10/12, in that particular font, so that nobody else can do that any longer without copyright infringements? Honestly, that's mere nonsense!

I suppose Georg and every other type collector that desires to give the world a glance at his collection, has to set those specimens all over again, instead of scanning those which are available already. Poor, poor world.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well,
first of all: Good Morning. Its 8:03 am in Germany and this is not my time.
I'll think about your arguments, you brought logical ones.
What I do is not only to collect fonts.
My place here is like a heater: I buy old german typesetting departments (there are still dozends of it all over Germany from family printing companies, which are existing since more than two or three generations).
I clean and check the types and I print new ones with a full sort of alphabet, digits and - what is it in english "Punkturen" (all special signs). After printing I offer the type in my Online-Shop and give it back to printers again. Because I want it to be used in real life, not only sleeping in my cabinets. There is a small community of, let's say, 200 up to 300 printers from Germany, Italy, England and from the US, which buy and use my types.
For 2007 I am planning a printing project - so I scan all my alphabets. May be you'll see it as senseful for your own projects to use one of my scans. Let me know.
I want to look for some advices from some experienced typesetters here in Germany to make my own decision.

Regards,
Georg
PS: Please do not use those fonts between 1933 and 1945 - there are other fonts which even better characterize Germany.

		<div class="commentbody">@ Ludwig, do you understand this german article you sent the links from?
"It seems Paul Renner’s Futura was Adolf Hitler’s favourite typeface:
http://www.druckerey.de/pdf/FrakturschriftSZ2005.pdf"

What you say is absolutely wrong.
There is not one sentence in the article about Paul Renner.

Paul Renner was striktly forbidden to work as a typographist after 1933. He was against the Nazis. 

The article explains about the so called "Fraktur-Verbot" (all use of Fraktur were forbidden) sind 1941. Only Antiqua fonts where allowed for all administrative letters.

<cite>Daß Hitler die gebrochenen Schriften nicht mochte, zeigt Luidl an einem Beispiel: ein Wettbewerb für einen Urkunden-Entwurf. <strong>Hitler entscheidet sich für die Futura</strong>, eine serifenlose, moderne Schrift. Luidl führt dazu nichts weiter aus, dabei ist diese Geschichte hochinteressant und unterstreicht Hitlers modernen Geschmack. Die Futura war 1928 unter den Händen <strong>Paul Renner</strong>s entstanden mit dem etwas absurden Anspruch, die Schrift dieser Zeit zu sein. […] Hitlers Leute, so Luidl, nannten <strong>Renner</strong> einen Kulturbolschewisten, machten da also keinen Unterschied, weil sie eigentlich der Fraktur anhingen. Hitler selbst differenzierte gewiß unbewußt zwischen <strong>Renner</strong> und Bauhaus, <strong>wenn er die Futura anderen Schriften vorzog</strong> und gegen das Bauhaus wetterte</cite>

ich bin froh, daß Sie besser deutsch verstehen und schreiben als ich englisch.

Ich kenne den Autor des Beitrages im PDF. Er ist ein guter Bleisatz-Freund und ein guter Kunde von mir. Wir haben fast täglich Kontakt über ein deutsches Typographen-Forum. Aus diesem Grund kenne ich auch seine Einstellung zu diesem Thema.

Ihr genanntes Beispiel zeigt eindeutig, daß Hitler die Fraktur ablehnt. Eben weil er sich stattdessen im Beispiel für die Futura entscheidet. Aber das bedeutet doch nicht, daß die Futura seine Lieblingsschrift ist.

If you ask me which font I like more: 
Univers or Folio-Grotesk (I don't like both) I'ld say: Folio.
Because its from K.F.Bauer. But this does not mean that I like the Folio.

You are thinking in stereotypes.
"The Germans" is as wrong as "The Americans".

But its alright.
Would be more honest to ask me to leave instead of starting to flame me, mh? Question of style.

I acknowledge that Derrida is not the most common author and likely the rehabilitation of blackletter is indeed a postmodernist phenomenon.

Thank you Thomas for the link about Heltzel's digital version of Element. Most useful, and previously unknown to me. 

The alternative (and more loaded) term I've come across for 'Neugothische Schriften' is ‘schaftstiefelgrotesks’ or ‘jackboot gothics’ – particularly in reference to the National, Tannenberg and Gotenburg you mention above. I understand some of what Georg says about this and I'm sympathetic to it (even if Hrant is not). For this reason I prefer your 'Neugothische Schriften' which I roughly translate as 'modernised blackletter'. Element was perhaps the best attempt at this.

My own unofficial theory is that the blackletter types have been and continue to be rehabilitated via youth culture; nowadays we might not read it in books so much, but it'll be splashed all over the t-shirt next to you. The old heavy metal and punk styles continue to get recycled – all my skater/punker students wouldn't be seen dead in anything less than a really heavy fraktur... preferably printed black on black! (Getting them to actually read what it says might be the next challenge.)

From those students point of view – that I think Futura was/is a pinnacle of modernist achievement, and that I'm suspicious (hateful is not right) of postmodernism, just makes me look like an old fart... like Hitler. But I can live with that : )</div>

But I think and hope that its revival in the realm of conscious/display usage will naturally lead to its eventual re-use for subconscious/text - once we properly apply the element of subtelty, the key ingredient of text face design.

Postmodernism: don't judge it based on the prototypical stunts by juveniles and hooligans that we saw in the 90s. To me, PoMo holds great promise (once we completely get over it as a fashion) because it embodies the human reality much better than Modernism, which is for circuit boards, not humans. Our teachers were wrong.

I did use the term "Schaftstiefelgrotesk", but i changed. Even if there was no reign of Nationalsocialism, there would be formmodels you could compare to those of the existing "Neugotische Schriften". 
Thesis:
I think the "strictness" and simplicity of the forms were influenced by the former Groteskschriften like Akzidenz Grotesk..., too. Even something like the "Bauhaus modernism" had influences on the development. 
I think of, for example, Tannenberg (my favourite) as an excellent display fontface.

@Bleisetzer
I've only heard that Henzel digital fonts are "good" or "quite good", whatever it means. I don't expect opentype features and such. Only "proper" outlines, the right ligatures, long-s, etc. Mr. Henzel should offer PDF to download, maybe i get in contact with him.

(Veering wildy off-topic) Hrant, I didn't say I judged Postmodernism; merely that I'm suspicious of it. <em>Had I judged it, I might have said that PoMo held great promise – as a fashion.</em> Your appeal not to judge... begs the question, well, what are we to judge Postmodernism by? And guess what, every time the question gets framed, the terms of reference have moved... so that's why I'm suspicious.

Most theories apply themselves more readily to circuit boards than to homo horribilis. But to sloganise reaction to any teacher's viewpoint is perhaps to miss the fundamental point of education (a.k.a. find stuff out for yourself) Agreed?

Meanwhile I'll call for a digital revival of Cheltenham Inline. It's from ATF, so I guess M.F. Benton, but I don't know the date. Maybe 1912? Those old guys. Sheeesh.

Is education really about finding your own way? I would actually say the opposite: it's to learn how to behave in one's environment - to meet the system's expectations of what you should know. Personal discovery certainly does happen, but I think formal education sees that as a bug, not a feature. :-/  In fact the limits of formal education are parallel to those of Modernism: they both focus on the formal, the superficial, the mechanical. This is only half of our reality, and PoMo -if applied selflessly, instead of as a means of artistic expression- can be an invaluable link to the other half; I say "link" because I feel the other half is essentially out of our conscious reach, although I believe it's what makes us most "real".

It depends on the size of the class.
Because each child/student is different, each has to be educated differently (I forget which educationalist said that, but I would agree, although in practice it is possible to find similarities that are project-based and provide the same instruction -- whether that's considered training or education).

I had the privilege of teaching a class of 16 students, in a four-hour practicum session, and found that it was just about possible to give each student individual attention. Although some always ended up demanding more time, which is a dilemma; should the more able students allow the less able that extra time, or should everyone get the same time? Or are those who wheedle more time doing it for selfish or social reasons? Etc, etc. 

So, in that 15 minutes, the teacher's job is to get inside the student's head and help them solve the design problem in a manner that results in personal growth, rather than just following what is establishment-rote, or trendy, or the way the student has always done it (lazy), or the way that would impress other students, or the way the teacher would do it, or the way that would score most marks, or look best in a portfolio.

Now, you could say that if the teacher takes such a personal approach, it is postmodern, because the intent is to decontextualize the design process. But on the other hand, the very notion of educating the individual is so very modern. As an alternative, the collaborative approach to design education is very hard to pull off, especially given the increasing hold of the performance principle in the sphere of art education. However, there are some who try, for instance with students working in teams on real-world projects for local communities.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Ludwig,

I am surprised that no one has mentioned the roman seen in Il Manuale di Cottura of 1478. It was a constant reference for many punchcutters of the 17th century, yet it has strangely gone un-revived by modern designers. I believe that Johnathan Hoefler started a revival for a magazine a some point in the mid 1990s but the project took another turn. I have considered reviving this myself, but my corporate clients don't like revivals very much. I examined the copy at St Bride Printing Library a few years back whilst I was at Typotechnica, but upon my last visit I was unable to locate it.

Perhaps one of you should look into it!

I would post some of my photos, but I can't figure out this confounded system.

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm. Much to think about here. Maybe <em>learning</em> is what we do for ourselves and <em>education</em> is what is there to keep us in our places. Maybe this is semantic hairsplitting, but the two are not always the same. When I go back to Hrant's slogan I realise that many of my teachers were not wrong, but then they didn't always reside in the classroom. So I must be meaning some wider concept of education here.

As for PoMo's putative <em>merits with respect to serving mankind.</em> I'm not necessarily served better by postmodern typeface design, if that's what you mean (and at this point we have to take into account those 90s hooligans). But at least I don't have to introduce Modernism to anyone with an upfront disclaimer that they should disregard the early posturings of those 1920s juveniles... I mean, what were we going to do? wait for Modernism to 'mature'? I disagree with the claim that Modernism's focus was (on the) superficial. It's enough for me to note that 'serious' design companies like the Dyson Corporation still use Futura as an advertising collateral typeface, 80 years later. I just don't see that happening with Template Gothic. Yet.

Meanwhile I'll join the call for Randolph to post images of the 1478 roman. And I'd like to see this classic in digital format; Granby, designer(s) unknown – possibly based on Johnston's Underground Lettering. Stephenson Blake Foundry. About 1930. Elsner & Flake have done this, but I think their family is incomplete. Apparently it's also the basis of Jeremy Tankard's <a/href="http://www.typography.net/type/wayfarer.htm">Wayfarer.</a>

		<div class="commentbody">While we're on the subject of serving mankind, I found this gem on John Maeda's Simplicity Blog.

These are two maxims that distinguishes the technologist from the humanist:
Technologist: I do, because I can.
Humanist: I do, because I care.

I interpreted the former as PoMo, and the latter as 'matured' PoMo or Humanism.

Technology, he said, can create progress. And hasn't PoMo does the same thing to typography? But it's certainly not justifiable to do things just because one could. Egoistically, if you will.

'Matured' PoMo, on the other hand, strives to serve others while still maintaining the same "I do" attitude of experimentation and playfulness.

It's all about "humanized technology" like Mr. Maeda put it, or in our context, "experimentation that serve others".</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree somewhat, but to refine it I would say that the hooligan PoMoist is "I do, because I am" (as in self-centered, yes) while the mature PoMoist is "I do, because I can't fully know" (as in there's always something new to create). Hmmm, not too good - let me try another way. The hooligan PoMoist wants dynamism/change because the establishment shunns him and his -valid- instincts and he hates that, while the mature PoMoist wants dynamism/change because he knows the establishment is full of it, even though he doesn't know exactly what's going on either, but that's OK because he admits it, plus nobody really knows anyway, it's just that some people act like they do, and they suck.

Modernism is about Control. PoMo is about relinquishing control.

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm, your thoughts about the hooligan (pardon the term) and the mature PoMoists are interesting. I have a hard time distinguishing between the two, though, especially when you tried to explain it the second time around.

For instance:
- Being shunned by the establishment, and
- Knowing that the establishment is full of themselves
Is an effect and cause of PoMo in general, don't you think? You know that they're full of themselves, so that's why you're alienated by them. A call for dynamism/change, then, is a natural response to that. Every PoMoist has to have that.

I do like your first two statements, though, when you distinguish PoMoists by their intent. One do it to please himself (I would call this, pardon my term once again, "masturbatory"), the other do it in an honest passion for learning and discovery.

I think that your point of view is a great angle of looking at PoMo.

Personally, I think that the hooligan wants change for its own sake (which is not bad, by the way, just poorly defined), while the mature wants change because he knows that without change, he won't progress any further.

The subject of control and relinguishing control is mighty interesting, too, and as I said, is yet another angle of looking at the subject.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant — This really isn't something special. Just good old Alte Schwabacher (don't know whether the one from URW or Berthold; let's hope its not the BQ ;-), used for body text.

Forssman & de Jong write: "Eine Anwendung, wie geschaffen zum Beweis, daß gebrochene Schrift lebt, solange es unvoreingenommene Typografen gibt." That designer was Günter Bose, who says to have become a blackletter enthusiast while reading Albert Kapr.

The application and use of the Schwabacher is correct, for that manner: ligatures, long s etc. The designer quotes early sixteenth century typography by putting the title right in the body text, on the first page immediately after the end papers and by consequently setting CHancen (instead of Chancen), as was proper use for the word GOtt.

This quotation mania is all too pomo for me. But quite appropriate for setting a text by the upper pomo guru Derrida. It wouldn’t surprise me that the designer thought of the Judenschwabacher anecdote, when choosing a proper typeface for this Jewish author. Again, that kitschy pomo irony!

Well, not the font - but the contemporary usage for text certainly is!
I've been looking for a while.

But wait a second: just to check, when you talk about "quotes", you don't mean that the blackletter was in fact only used for peripheral material and not the whole body text, do you?

I don't. As you can see yourself, the complete body text is set in Schwabacher. As a matter of fact, it's the other way around: it's the marginal notes that are set in Antiqua (Janson?).

By "quoting" I meant that nasty pomo habit of not being able to invent something from it's own and thus lending or even plagiarising innovations from elder traditions. I do not mean to say that we shouldn’t look to tradition, on the contrary, but we should do so with respect and with a meaningful purpose, that it is with a practical function in mind. PoMo quotes/cites the givens of the past only with nihilistic irony, playing around with functionality that was devised to a proper means and with sincerity.</div>

Derrida is Jewish by ancestry, but was raised in a French Algerian milieu that wanted to distance itself from Judaism--the same background as Senator George Allen's mother. And it seems that he knew little of Judaism and especially found nothing to admire or adopt consciously from Jewish religion or tradition. Unlike Allen's mother, Derrida never hid his Jewish ancestry. But neither did he learn anything about Judaism or affiliate with anything Jewish. 

'Judaism' is a term that labels many things: an ethnic group, a religion, a culture, a community, a nation. They are all different, but overlap. Some people belong in many categories, some in a few. I am just saying that if you are only are Jewish by ancestry and otherwise don't belong to any of the other categories and say you couldn't care less, I don't count you as Jewish. So for me neither Derrida nor Senator Allen are Jewish. Others will have other views, and that is fine with me.  

<a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/access.cgi?uri=/journals/shofar/v021/21.2cohen.html">Here</a> is a review of a book about Derrida's Judaism that shares my opinion. 

There is not one official body but many, and they disagree about who is Jewish--typically Jewish :) </div>

Hrant, you must be reading one of your usual 'reliable sources'.

According to the unreliable sewage we read here in Virginia, such as the Washington Post, and what we hear on TV from Allen himself, Allen considers himself a Christian, and is one. 

He reacted with embarassment when his Jewish ancestry was 'outed' and accused a reporter of 'casting aspersions'. The Forward Jewish newspaper in New York first pointed out that his mother came from an old Tunesian Jewish family. As a result of then being asked about it, he this month asked his mother, and she finally admitted her Jewish ancestry to him.

But they don't count as Jews in your book anyway.
On the other hand at least they believe strongly in torture:
