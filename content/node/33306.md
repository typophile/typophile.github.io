  was unable to find the logo on brandsoftheworld.com but I will need to geta  vector
  version of this logo for a supplier of this product.\r\n\r\nIf this is just a standard
  typeface, awesome. Will make things easy.\r\n\r\nWhat type would the \"Capristo\"
  text be?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/capristo_4582.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Bryan, I should point out that the logo was probably created with an earlier
    version of Ax. See <a href="http://www.themeworld.com/cgi-bin/preview.pl/fonts/axaxax.0.zip">themeworld</a>.
