body: "When advertisers began needing speedy overturns of diverse fonts, designers
  had to come up with a quick solution. They would use old letterforms and amplify
  their appearance to make them look new. This solved the problem of getting the typefaces
  to the advertisers, but it did not result in creating well-made type. Most of the
  typefaces that were created were bastardized faces that eschewed classical typographical
  standards. Type must be legible and not simply used as background or gray matter,
  but as an instrument for conveying clear meaning. \r\n\r\nThree considerations have
  governed type design since the industry's beginning. Utility (how a face functions)
  and aesthetics, (how it looks on a printed page) both govern qualities of readability
  and legibility, while style affects what cultural code a typeface evokes. In the
  end, type is meant to attract and please.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mad_6032.jpg]\r\nNothing
  against Madigans, but any sign that cannot easily be read, fails in its overall
  purpose. Type is meant to be legible and accurately display the style and feel of
  the time and place, this sign does neither. \r\n\r\nThe slanted and squished lettering
  makes the sign both illegible and unclear. If you can't read the sign, then there's
  no way of knowing what buisness is being advertised. The kerning is uneven and unpleasant
  to look at, and the only clearly decipherable letter is the \"g\" in the very middle
  of the word. This sign's lettering is uneasy on the eyes, forcing them to squint
  in and out of focus to try and make out what is written. \r\n\r\nPerhaps they should
  have tried to be less sleek looking and stuck with a more classic, unbasterized
  typeface. "

    be closed. I bet when the neon is on there is a world of difference in readability/legibility.
    The painted letters are only a backdrop, or foil, for the neon. Go back when it
    is on and see if it is better.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    ignored here. But you shouldn't be so hasty (it's only been about three weeks,
    and you've seen how long threads can survive on Typophile**) and certainly not
    so easily offended. I was in your position recently (actually much worse, since
    I had spent a fair amount of time thinking, scanning and writing) and lost my
    cool ever so slightly after two weeks, but managed to resume help two months after
    that, and eventually got an overly gracious response: http://typophile.com/node/51729\r\n\r\n*

  body: "Dear Michael,\r\nI am sorry if my response time was not prompt enough for
    you, I appreciated your comment and, yes it is better at night. I do not however
    appreciate the name calling and negative comments about my blog. Our beautiful
    and brilliant professors here at Loyola merely wanted to expose us to another
    aspect of design media by having us post our extra assignments on here. I did
    not mean to offend you by posting and running, but this blog is  just one part
    of the many time consuming projects that we as students must devote our time to.
    I hope that you can respect what we are posting in the future, and if you wish
    to comment please keep it constructive. No one benefits from childish insults
    or negative input. \r\nThank you,\r\nJessica"
