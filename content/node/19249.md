  body: 'Adrian Frutiger has demonstrated great understanding, but never made a great
    book face. On the other hand, Gill had no extraordinary understanding of text
    type but made Joanna. One designer who knew what he was doing and also managed
    to create at least one inspired book face was Dwiggins, whose Electra synthesizes
    so many of the tendencies in 20thC type design: Updike''s and Morison''s love
    of the best transitional printing, chirographic humanism, the modernist search
    for a type for the age and the newly general recognition of the uses of irregularity.'

    instincts more than true \r\nunderstanding. For one thing he used to think extenders
    are superfluous!\r\nBut yes, Electra is one of most favorite faces.\r\n\r\n> Its

    enough for the client, who rejected it.\r\nWhat good non-Latin faces has Frutiger

  body: "\"One\" doesn't give a good picture, because different were strong in different
    ways. A top five to ten will be better. Also for late 20th century--the digital
    age, we are probably too close to it to judge reasonably. One era is 1890-1985,
    from the Benton pantographic punch cutter. \r\n\r\nMorris Fuller Benton has to
    be among that top list, because he more than anyone created the type business
    for that period, and was one of the best craftsmen. So too Goudy and Zapf, creators
    of the most original, excellent typefaces. My late Uncle Ben Lieberman used to
    categorize these as 'personal' designers, because they put a strong individual
    personality into their work. Benton represents the opposite style, of being a
    craftsman subservient to the design. Frutiger also has to be on the list because
    of doing the most influential new design, his Frutiger sans. I don't know who
    exactly did a lot of those faces from Monotype and Linotype, so their drawing
    offices would have to be also on the list. Tschichold I think would have to be
    on the list also not so much because of Sabon, but because of being the most influential
    thinker on how to use type--both in his modernist and traditionalist phases. Hence
    he influenced also how people thought about type design. \r\n\r\nObviously Matthew
    Carter--the contemporary designer most like Benton in his wide range and flawless
    craftsmanship--is going to be on everyone's list for the latter part of the century,
    but I would just leave out anyone younger than Zapf and Frutiger, as their contributions
    are too recent for perspective. \r\n\r\nI also adore Dwiggins' faces, but I don't
    think he was so influential. He is more influential now, I think, than ever. "

    Walter Tracy's top 5 for the 20th century, if that backs me up any ;-)"

  body: "I don't know where the cutoff for \"master\" might be, but I think the successful
    design of multiple scripts (especially including those for which one lacks nativity)
    is certainly an exceptionally good indicator of merit in a type designer.* It's
    a superb test of one's powers of abstraction and ability to go deeper than the
    mere rote articulation of canned formal relationships. For example, that \"3\"
    shape in Frutiger's Devanagari is a clear sign that there's something seriously
    wrong; as Peter Lofting has remarked about that font: \"You cannot chop up the
    curly bits.\"\r\n\r\n* Which is why I think Granjon was far superior to Garamont.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    good and sadly underused. There was a brief moment a few years ago, when I read
    three new books in succession that were set in Meridien, but it seems to have
    been a freak occurence and not indicative of wider use. Meridien requires careful
    printing and appropriate paper, but then so do many other types, including Dwiggin's
    Electra."

    with the discontinuity between the structural utilitarianism of the counters and
    x-height and the zippy, free-wheeling finish. The personality seems both painted
    on and too strident for any deeply considered text. '
