    if it's a custom draw, I prefer to think that the designer used some already designed
    font, I guess that Billy would do the job, thanks for putting me in the right

  body: I think it is custom too, but there a lot of pizzadude fonts in this late
    '50s to early '70s cartoon style such as [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/eyeful/|Eyeful]]
    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/skramp/|Skramp]]. Font Bureau's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/asphalt/|Asphalt]]
    is very nice.

  body: "Hi Guys:\r\n\r\nI have to accept that there's a high probability that this
    is, in fact, a custom job, since the Mika character is part of a beach themed
    clothing brand, called \"Se\xF1or Frogs\" and they have very creative designers
    around them, so, let's leave this way, I just wanted something similar to the
    font used in the character logo, and I get what I needed thanks to you guys :-D...\r\n\r\nThanks
    a lot...\r\n\r\nQ\u2122 Says: It's All About The Fonts!"
