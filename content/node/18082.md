body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI'm a grad student working on a research project involving non-static
  logo systems: ID systems comprised of some elements that are consistent and other
  elements that change from one implementation to another. The most well-known example
  is probably the MTV logo -- the shape and configuration are consistent but the color,
  patterns and animation style are always changing. Other examples are the \"Nick
  Jr.\" pre-school Nickelodeon tv identity (illustrations of parent and child animals)
  and of course the Google logo.\r\n\r\nCan you think of other examples? Or even better,
  have you seen anything written about this that I could track down? In books, in
  magazines, on blogs, whatever. If you have ideas or resources to share I would really
  appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRob"

  body: How about <a href="http://www.typographi.com/">Typographica</a>? Does that
    fit your bill? And then there's always the venerable Typophile itself. Ever heard
    of it? :) It's always changing.

  body: The new <a href="http://www.bahamas.com/bahamas/index.aspx">Bahamas</a> promotional
    identity and advertising campaign are an excellent contemporary example of this.
    If you ride the right lines in the Metro, you'll see their print ads.

    linked but distinct logos.

  body: The Olympics would be a good example of multi-faceted branding. You can probably
    find stuff online, and there's an article in the current issue of Communication
    Arts.

  body: Some book publishers also allow the designer to modify their logo to match
    the design of the jacket. Chip Kidd's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0847827488/">Book
    One</a> has examples of this. I think Knopf is the specific publisher.

  body: "FontShop: same grid/boxes/colours, but the fonts change.\r\n\r\nThe logo
    for the ATypI conference in Copenhagen 2001 was cery cool. I can't find a sample
    online. I have the T-shirt, but it's only non-static when I move. For the animation
    (as i recall), the 5 characters were split in half horizontally, and the top and
    bottom parts wandered/jiggled around, slowly and slighty.\r\n\r\nI change the
    typefaces of my logo every few years. Presently my website logo is animated. It's
    done by cycling about 40 different applications of the \"noise\" filter to the
    same file.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shinntype.gif]"
