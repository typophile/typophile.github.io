  body: "And the two main subcategories seem to be Egyptian Fats and Geometric Fats.\r\n\r\nNon
    Format seems to have based its Egyptian Fats off of Giza Nine Five. And there
    is a decent selection of other Egyptian Fats like Sabbath Black, Akimoto, etc.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the Geometric Fats, the selection seems not so great imo. Probably best to
    make your own for this style."
