  published in 1805 by Cottom and Stewart, Alexandria, Virginia.  In its day, it was
  a popular book. \r\n\r\nThe paragraphs are justified. While not annoying, there
  is quite noticeable variation in spacing between words and spacing in relation to
  punctuation. \r\n\r\nIt seems clear that the text would flow better had the paragraphs
  been set ragged right.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know whether obvious variation in spacing
  is common to \"everyday\" books of the 18th/19th century?\r\n\r\nIf so, why were
  such books set justified rather than ragged?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    in word spacing causing rivers and white blobs, then it wasn't set very well.
    Justified setting, if done well, should give the page a really nice \"constructed\"
    feel with even colour and I personally think it reads very well as there's no
    jarring rags to disrupt your reading patterns. I think FL/RR sometimes has an
    unpleasant texture on the page but this depends largely on the typeface.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    most type set in books in the past five centuries have been justified text, even
    the scribes justified their handwriting in the past.   \r\n\r\nOthers with experience
    in designing books should be able to answer your other questions!"

    sentences.\r\n\r\nI'm also looking at a facsimile of the first, 1896 edition of
    the Fannie Farmer Cookbook, which was immensely successful. Again, very generous
    spacing between sentences (I would call it exaggerated). Spacing between words
    has a somewhat more regular appearance than in the earlier book, but there are
    still lots of instances of quite noticeable variation.\r\n\r\nThe justification
    in both books is inferior, in terms of regularity, to what one sees in more modern
    books.  On the other hand, it has a certain \"character\"."

  body: "Style varies over time.\r\nThere are a number of things in the Homer page
    that would be done differently today.\r\nSuch as no space before colon and semi-colon,
    less space before a new sentence, and a tighter Y-e kern.\r\nTo my eye, the initial
    B hangs out too far, and the final period should fill out the measure: is this
    perception caused by a fault in the original, a difference in personal preference,
    or the way style changes over time? it's impossible to know.\r\n\r\n19th century
    modern types require ample word spacing, due to the large size of the serifs,
    and the lack of kerning. Words like New, and You, with a big space between the
    first two letters, need to be preceeded by plenty of wordspace. Compare Scotch
    with Times\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TheNews_5937.jpg]\r\nI don't
    think this is a fault of the Scotch (although today one would kern and space it
    slightly tighter), it's just that subsequently people have preferred a more even
    letterspacing over \"full\" lettershapes; the openness of the Times glyphs would
    have seemed improper to the Victorians, who found wide open apertures vulgar.
    In other words, Redge, they paid more attention to letter detail than \"flow\"
    -- meticulous individual grooming being more important than social ease, for a
    socio-cultural interpretation."

    In the 1970s and 80s, they certainly put great store in spacing type, and to our

    mass circulation magazines and newspapers, Horatio Alger self-improvement. Did
    all that happen in spite of the type style of the day being so \"unreadable\"?
    Rather, wouldn't it be logical to assume that the type style was a major contributor

    well be be the most reader-friendly of all time?"

    of all, I didn't say it was highly unreadable. What I said was simply that there's
    such a thing as Bad Spacing that transcends time and race (because all humans
    share certain physical traits, that pertain to reading for example), and that
    \"Ne\" suits the description. Second, <cite>of course</cite> the evolution of
    reading from an elite activity to a populist one could have come in spite of the
    typestyle. For one thing, aren't you the one always saying that the overall typography
    is always more relevant than the mere specific type? Not to mention that there
    are factors way more relevant to such a societal shift than typography. Lastly,
    Scotch could (and I think does) have other attributes that made up for that lousy
    spacing (which I'm assuming you're correct in considering a \"feature\" of the
    style).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Scotch spacing is not good or bad against some absolute, it's the best spacing
