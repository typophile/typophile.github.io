body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Rubylith</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the
  days of phototypesetting, which lasted from about the second World War until 1984,
  letters slowly moved away from being metal type.\r\n\r\nIn 1945, there were two
  kings of metal type, generally speaking. Lead type, sometimes called \"cold metal
  type,\" has still being cast for handsetting. This was Gutenberg's method\u2014500
  years old, but still in use. Lead type was produced by a [[matrix]]. These matrices
  usually were made by stamping steel punches into some other sort of softer metal,
  sometimes copper. The other kind of metal type also used a combination of poured
  lead at matrices: \"hot metal type,\" or machine casting (using Linotype, Monotype,
  Intertype machines, etc.). The matrices for these machines were usually not made
  by hand, but rather with pantographic cutters, descended from [[Lynn Boyd Benton]]'s
  famous invention. \r\n\r\nThese cutting machines used large-scale letter drawings
  as their guides. These drawings were still necessary after the days of metal type
  had past. The drawing were again used as models to cut (either by machine or by
  hand) a new sort of matrix: <strong>rubylith friskets</strong>. A rubylith frisket
  was a very large letter (about the size of an 8.5\" x 11\"\u2014or A4\u2014sheet
  of paper), on a sheet of plastic. This sheet had been covered by rubylith\u2014which
  is red\u2014and the letter shape had been cut out of it. These new matrices could
  then be photographically reduced to produce the lettershapes found in phototypesetting
  systems, all of which were different from manufacturer to manufacturer, and even
  from product to product.\r\n\r\n<strong>See also [[Amberlith]]</strong>"
