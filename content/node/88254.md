body: "I would like to compile a list of living designers who\r\nhave exhibited high
  insight into \"speculative\" type design:\r\nworks that push the boundaries with
  no firm hope of success.\r\nThese don't have to be finished fonts, they just have
  to exhibit\r\nunorthodox thought, hopefully causing others to expand their\r\ndesign
  horizons. If you list anybody it would be nice to mention\r\nspecifically why.\r\n\r\nThis
  list might include graphic designers who have not made type\r\nthemselves but have
  exhibited a strong appreciation for this \"genre\".\r\n\r\nI'll start off with the
  obvious: Neville Brody (Fuse).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    font too! I say that because that's not a requirement here.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    at the subtle end of the spectrum:\r\nBloemsma (Legato), except he's no longer
    with us.\r\n\r\nI hope I'm getting my drift across (it's not so easy).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    type' design...\r\n\r\nI would include 'andrew byron' as just such a person.\r\n\r\nHe
    certainly pushes the boundaries of type design and opens up our imagination to
    look at things in a different way.\r\n\r\nI like his stuff.\r\n\r\nNot very marketable,
    but some of his ideas would make for an interesting font.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I think
    I've seen type designers mimicking some of his ideas and stuff recently.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/8/view/8293/experimental-type-by-andrew-byrom.html\r\n\r\nAnd
    here is an interesting link to experimental type design, compiled by Luc Devroye.\r\n\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/experimental.html\r\n\r\nAnd
