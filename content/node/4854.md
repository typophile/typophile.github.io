  body: 'The two logos, like most large corporation or brand names, are both most
    likey custom designed. If you want to parody the parody T-shirt, you can try <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/aachen/bold/testdrive.html?s=Supertones&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Aachen Bold</a> and compress it slightly. IMHO, though, it doesn&#39;t
    approximate the logo, if that was its intent. I think people will probably get
    it nonetheless. '

  body: lol Tiffany... I never saw &#39;Sinkist&#39; before, but now that you pointed
    it out I can&#39;t see &#39;Sunkist&#39; anymore! <BR> <BR>as for the ID, Tom,
    I think the only font in the bunch is for &#34;D O U G H N U T S&#34; in the Krispy
    Kreme logo,
