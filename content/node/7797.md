body: 'Alchion Design Lab is essentially Design Alchemy re-named with a few changes
  in crew, a new marketing strategy and of course naming/identity. <BR> <BR>Aesthetic:
  simple, minimalist, balanced yin/yang &#40;soft / hard edges/ weight&#41; geometric.
  Should form abstract A, D, L.  <BR>&#40;for Alchion Design Lab&#41; this is accomplished
  by removing any single side of structure and leaving rest.  <BR> <BR>Construction:
  mathematical construction, re-worked for optical   <BR>balance &#40;narrowing horizontal
  vs vertical elements&#41; so they look equal in weight. I started by deconstructing
  Unicratica typeface  for to develop basic look.  <BR> <BR>Market: I would like it
  to appeal to pharma/scientific industry as well as fashion and manufacturing industry.

  body: Hey ole - <BR> <BR>the diagram you have created is beautiful!  I think it
    would be helpful to see the ways that you might actually postion the letters of
    the logo.  As they are now it is hard to really critique anything, the shapes
    look good but will they communicate once laid out? <BR> <BR>I think that for a
    design company to try and target the fashion industry AND the pharmaceutical industry
    is a pretty huge task.  But I think that the cleaness of the characters that you
    have developed could be a good compromise between appealing to the two industries.
    <BR> <BR>good luck!

    up with that shape. And the Cyan is certainly very pharma. <BR> <BR>hhp

    Bruni and Manuel Krebs. I have still not nailed it the way I want it, but I think
    I am close. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/54121.jpg" alt="Alchion

    Great work! I prefer the &#34;curved side&#34; logotype over the straight.

  body: I experimented with this type design a while back, and wondered if perhaps
    it should be re-considered instead on the more ordinary/simplified looking design
    I had choosen and shown in previous posts. I will be implementing all the work
    into print media and the portfolio fabrication next week, and need to be sure
    in the choices I am making. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56182.jpg"

  body: The more ordinary type design is better. It looks very clean, especially in
    the complex context of the portfolio design. The last two graphics of the earlier
    alternative have fussy.

  body: I am setting type for the businesscards I am about to get printed and started
    thinking about a clever title for myself, that projects  <BR>a sense of humor
    well as a clever/concise description of what I do. I came up with a few titles.
    <BR> <BR>Alchionist- well my design co. is called Alchion &#40;not an actual word,
    but a simplification of my previous ficticious business name Design Alchemy&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Alphabeautician &#40;sounds scientific which I like but perhaps a bit
    over the top for some&#41;,  <BR> <BR>Brandist- I believe it has been done by
    others-and a bit too corporate. <BR> <BR>Alpha &#40;as in primary contact/owner,
    and leaning toward type <BR>design being something I enjoy- It also could imply
    an alpha male who takes control &#40;which could be &#43; or -&#41; <BR> <BR>Visually
    flipping titles, etc... <BR>I have looked to long at this to be objective. please
    give me your thoughts.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56819.jpg"

    or whatever is just too unserious. What about &#34;Alpha Alchemist&#34;? <BR>
