  to make it easier on me. <BR> <BR>This is what I came up with: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/28952.jpg"

  body: tDR designed a cover for the new Plaid album Spokes with a fat font on the
    cover. <BR><a href="http://down10.com/fonts/spokes.html"> This font</a> is a font
    based on that lettering. <BR> <BR>Also, Peter Bruhn did a filled in version of

  body: Surprisingly, I like the style. <BR> <BR>On the actual card though some of
    the letterform ambiguity is translating into actual probable confusion, due to
    letter sequences people <i>expect</i>. The two big problems I see are both in
    your last name &#40;and they&#39;re supporting each other&#41;, which is tempting
    to read &#34;BRIGHTAL&#34; or at best &#34;BRICHTAL&#34;. Just making the tops
    of the &#34;A&#34; round would probably make it snap into place. <BR> <BR>Also,
    I would put a dot &#40;vertically centered&#41; before the &#34;ORG&#34; - for
    one thing some people would think &#34;Oregon&#34;... and maybe as a result think
    you live in town where everybody is always very hungry.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Good call, Hrant. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the suggestions, everyone. I&#39;m really
    digging the Plaid tribute font... it looks easy to cut out and it&#39;s a lot
    prettier than mine. <BR> <BR>I found another good &#39;un... <a href="http://www.jemmagura.com/2002/index.html">Jemma
    Gura</a> uses a ultrasimplified font in her anti-war poster &#40;7th link down
    on the right&#41;.

  body: I like this John. How would an uppercase G variant look? <BR> the current
    G, imo, reads too much like a 9.  <BR> <BR>LTYZ need some more girth, imo. <BR>
    <BR>The font used by Jemma Gura is Nova from YWFT. <BR><a href="http://youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0013"

  body: I like that G a lot more. I think the Z still needs some weight  <BR>on the
    diagonal. Also, the <BR>horizontal stems on the L,T and 7  <BR>might work better
    if they were as heavy  <BR>as the one on the 9, imo. <BR> <BR>bj
