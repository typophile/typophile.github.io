  body: "This will look neat once it is produced and displayed. What kind of info
    graphics will it be presented with?\r\n\r\nSome terms/wording are defintiely stronger
    in the heirarchy (I see Spiders and Dying Alone first). No words in the HOPE portion
    stand out as strongly as those 2 do in FEAR. \r\n\r\nAlso curious about what influenced
    your color choice.\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"
