    the two Os are rendered differently, which is a good indication that it's a custom
    job. \"Everything Is Golden\" may be a font, but again the sample is so small
    that it's tough to tell. I've had a quick look through the \"Eroded\" section
    of DaFont, and while there's nothing that is a definite, there are a dozen or
    more fonts there that would do the job.\r\n\r\n-NJ"
