    me...

    assumed the attached file was the same since the file name was the same. (Are
    we all seeing the same image here?)\r\n\r\nAs for the one it the link (\"VISAGE\"),
    it looks like something from the early seventies, but I don't see it in any of
    my usual references (old phototype and rub-down type catalogs). There are things
    that are sort of similar, but nothing that matches. Could be custom."

    with the company (Visage)\r\n  & they are going to try to find out as well.\r\n
