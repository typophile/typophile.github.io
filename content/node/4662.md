  body: 'I started taking photos of inverted and flipped letters a few years ago,
    but gave up when I realised just how often this happens. My favourite example
    is in Brompton Oratory in London: there is a monumental text running around the
    inside of the dome in brass letters that must be at least 3ft high &#40;it is
    difficult to judge, because it is so far up&#41;. One of the Xs is upside down.'
