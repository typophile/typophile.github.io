  see attached.\r\n\r\nIt is a brochure about a new building the organization I work
  for is building.\r\n\r\nI thought it really suited the brochure. Since it uses lines
  and looks as if it was done with a ruler. And the brochure has pictures of children
  building and pictures of architectual floor plans.\r\n\r\nI want to find somehting
  similar but in hebrew. Can you help?\r\n\r\nI would prefer if it was a free font.
  But a bought one is also ok if there is nothing else.\r\n\r\nPlease help!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n(Ps
  - I have put it on the heberw graphic design forum called tapuz. If you know any
  other hebrew graphic design/typography forums please advise me).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    don''t know a Hebrew font like that. Masterfont''s Tushtush is a ''distressed''
    font like this which has something of a similar feel. '
