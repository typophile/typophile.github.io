body: Is it right for a webdesigner to tell the graphic designer to make sure they
  create a logo that they can slap onto a coloured background for the website? I want
  opinions because I feel it is not appropriate as I think it looses the logo's quality
  and its essence and throws the real purpose of it out of the window as the web designer
  would like it white on his coloured background. Geez, am I in the wrong or he? What
  are your opinions? Is he being lazy and not wanting to work around the logo on the
  website and making it harder for me to come up with something for the logo or is
  he purely right? Thanks

  body: "The logo has to perform in any realistic scenario. Clearly it is going to
    need to be reversed.\r\n\r\nSay, for instance, in the future the company sponsors
    an event. The event host wants to include all the sponsor logos on the bottom
    of a brochure. That logo may need to be reversed. It may need to be really small.
    \r\n\r\nIt is very common to reverse a mark. I would say that if a mark was designed
    that couldn't be reversed the designer would have needed to strongly advise the
    client about the issue before they made their selection."

  body: "It is usual (essential) that a logo works in many environments, which would
    include a white out version. If an identity existed before the website then the
    web designer should take this into account before designing the site. So although
    he might not be entirely right it is your responsibility take into consideration
    that most logos will eventually have to work in a less than ideal environment.
    And viewing it as right and wrong won\u2019t help in the long-run you should co-operate.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Logos have to be used for all purposes. (I know two others have said that
    already.)\r\n\r\nAn example is the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corp) who spent
    the better part of a million dollars to come up with an animated logo that looked
    wonderful in the TV commercials. Then they tried using it in their printed media,
    and had a great deal of trouble getting the animation to work well.\r\n\r\nIn
    the end, the logo was simplified considerably, and now works well in print and
    animated.\r\n\r\nNot as big a fiasco as NBCs, but still notable."

    elements they produce. It should address a variety of implementations including
    reversed out applications and use on screen.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Some good things to keep in mind when doing a logo are:\r\n\r\nIf you're
    using a spot colour and CMYK, make sure you do a straight 4 colour version as
    well.\r\nMake a 2 colour version, if you use a pantone colour\r\nMake a reversed
    (white) version and set your Illustrator file to 'view outlines' or set it on
    a dark background so people can see it when they open the file\r\nA 1 colour version
    (generally black), sometimes it's ok to go with different shades of black to show
    different areas, but be careful if you do so.\r\nmake RGB versions of the above
    coloured and 1 colour logos.\r\nInclude the correct values for PMS, CMYK and RGB
    in the standards guide\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure the logo will scan and fax well.\r\nCheck
    legibility at small sizes \u2013 it might be worth it to create a second version
    for use when scaled under a specific dimension. \r\nSet a minimum size in inches
    and pixels tho logo can be scaled down to, to ensure the best possible representation.
    \r\nCreate a guide for the amount of space left around the logo.\r\n"

    I like to envision the logo embroidered on a shirt. If it has small spidery lines,
    or other fine details, it probably won't work very well. Unless it's a logo for
    a black metal band."

    can read the min size is 20mm/20%, for example, and to include the exclusion area
    as a transparent box.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Also consider the use(s) of the logo - you might want variants. For example
    if it's a stacked logo you might need to do an all-on-one-line version. Try to
    anticipate every use the logo might have so that you can - as best as possible
    - prepare guidelines for it. If you leave matters to chance your client or their
    web designer may do something you don't like.
