  body: "Tironian sign is completely new to me too, the unicode is a land to discover,\r\ni
    choose to work with \"Et tu, Brute?\"\r\n\"The investigation of the history of
    \ \u2018printing types\u2019, for example, leads us to a series of interconnecting
    facts\" is forming a base for my informative publication\r\n\r\nbecause we deal
    with the \"middle eastern\" version of the brief;\r\nwe have to adapt english
    and arabic type- interesting and challenging.\r\nif we are to include 1500 words,
    750 latin and 750 arabic.\r\n\r\nmy subject basically the derivation of modern
    arabic type, through few phases.\r\nthere was proposals to latinize arabic type
    because of printing difficulties;\r\narabic being cursive and letters are almost
    always connected\r\nto the phase were printing technology could keep the spirit
    of arabic script,\r\nand be able to print it seamlessly. \r\nand finally the conversation
    between the latin world and arab world needed a good\r\nlatin arabic adaptation
    typefaces in order to make bilingual designs look harmonious.\r\n\r\nan eye-opening
    experience. i eat/drink/see/sense type all day because of this project.\r\n\r\n"
