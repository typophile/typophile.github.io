body: I&#39;ve recently finished designing a three weight, sans serif typeface and
  I&#39;ve run into a problem when printing at text sizes &#40;10pt and below&#41;.
  My laser printer &#40;HP 5MP&#41; seems to add a little weight to some strokes,
  like lc &#34;l&#34; and &#34;t&#34;, &#34;e&#34;. It also does weird things like
  add weight to the &#34;l&#34; half of the &#34;fl&#34; ligature and to the second
  quote of the double quotes. It&#39;s a very subtle thing, but when you look at text,
  it affects the &#34;color&#34;, giving it kind of a spotty texture. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  been told that it might have something to do with hinting, but I&#39;m not sure.
  I don&#39;t know much about hinting. I&#39;ve tried printing other similar faces
  &#40;VAG Rounded and  DIN&#41; to see if the same problem happens, and those faces
  seem to print fine. <BR> <BR>My next step is to see if the same problem happens
  on my inkjet. I&#39;ve also thought about getting a high-resolution match print.
  <BR> <BR>I created the font in Fontlab as Type 1, which I&#39;ve been told has very
  good hinting capabilities. <BR> <BR>Any words of wisdom would be much appreciated.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Pablo

    of bubbles&#34; which reconstruct <BR>the image of the letters on a certain size
    on screen. <BR>

  body: 'I&#39;d like to know about this as well. I have an HP laserjet 2100 &#40;1200
    dpi&#41;. My problem was that at 12 pt the serifs were distorted and didn&#39;t
    print the same consistently - I could see this clearly with a magifying class.
    When I did Fontlab&#39;s automatic hinting and exported it as a type 1 font, this
    seemed to cure it. Exporting it earlier with automatic hinting and as a true type
    font didn&#39;t do the trick. <BR> <BR>&#40;I have read on these boards that hinting
    does affect laser printers at small type sizes, so the serif problem makes sense.&#41;    <BR>
    <BR>But I still don&#39;t know how much distortion there is as compared to when
    it is properly hinted and/or printed offset. '

  body: Pablo, If you have a particularly light design, and your HP printer is printing
    at 600dpi in 10pt, your lowercase stems may be only 4 pixels wide. Without any
    hinting to hold the stems to consistent widths you may get some stems printing
    as 3 pixels or some as 5 pixels. This amount of difference of plus or minus 25%
    is going to be noticeable as you have seen. <BR> <BR>Try using FontLabs

  body: So I went ahead and generated the auto-hinting. It definately helped, but
    it&#39;s still not perfect. There are still a few inconsistencies in small text
    size stroke widths. I imagine I would have to hint manually &#40;ughhh&#41; if
    I want it any better. Any further comments and/or responses would be appreciated.
