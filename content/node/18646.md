  farm' for my production company. I specialize in long-form network / documentary
  work and needed something quick for a project. \r\n\r\nIt took 'final approval'
  to get the electronic files and now, hopefully, I can take the tweaking to another
  level. Now - there's time to play before a printing order and I can't help feeling
  that this could be 'more'. The font's Gothic No. 13 and the icon's a cityscape they
  came up with. Pantone 1805U for the reddish tint. \r\n\r\nI do really like Trade
  Gothic (which is a bit skinnier than this Gothic) but might be too skinny when up
  against the looming city thingie. It definitely makes for odd text positioning.
  Any and all input appreciated. I can take it.      Thanks in advance - Michael\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FCSpost1.jpg]"

  body: "First thing that caught my eye was the strange perspective on the plane where
    the \"buildings\" rise from. It's kind of weird.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the buildings
    rising forming an F is nice, but I'm a bit bothered by the strong perspective.
    I'd make a kind of isometric grid, and just have the buildings rise without the
    high perspective. I hope I'm making sense here... it's hard to explain what I'm
    talking about. Tomorrow, I'll post a jpeg explaining what I mean.\r\n\r\nAs for
    the type treatment, it's okay now, but it seems a tad clich\xE9. Maybe have the
    \"Fever City\" line in a condensed font, and the \"studio\" line in a normal,
    or even extended font. Trade Gothic's font styles would indeed be excellent for
    that."

  body: "The strong perspective would work for me if it were executed correctly. It
    seems like they were going for a wacky cartoon approximation of perspective, but
    it ended up looking more like they just botched half the lines. Strong concept
    though. I would make an actual 3D model and try different viewpoints. If the left
    side of the F-building shows, you could try putting the type on it. A simple flythrough
    would also make a nice logo animation for the screen.\r\n\r\nThe type is kind
    of traditional in comparison to the logo. It seems to call for something a bit
    more constructed."

    on a white field. ( could work )\r\n\r\nThis is rough, to say the least, but you
    have an implied city, and the excessive gradation wasn't helping. Typography is
    more subtle. ? Just an idea.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FCmockup.png]"

    body: "Good points all around. Thanks for puttin' eyes on it and helping. Keep
      'em coming... To that end, I do like your 'clean' take, Eric. There's implied
      confidence  versus \"Hey! 3D cartoon-type stuff!\". \r\n\r\nThere might be a
      happy medium as well. Maybe the windows add to the clutter / gradient mess?
      Originally, I remember the 'Fever City' text not being as big. Not to play armchair
      designer, but possibly they felt it wasn't weighted proportionally against this
      BIG city icon.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, Trade Gothic is lighter than this Gothic
      but I do like Eric's choice too. Clean. Might be worth digging up an earlier,
      less cluttered jpeg from the review process. Or not - I like these new directions."

  body: I'd say the one on the right is closest. I'm sure their is restraint from
    others not wanting to go into a free full scale consultation. Our of curiosity,
    why trade gothic?

    sort of dialogue I tried to establish with the outift that was getting paid. Granted
    - not paid ALL that much but still..... A logo company the likes of which you've
    seen online most likely.\r\n\r\nAs for Trade Gothic, that is a good question.
    I might have an unhealthy attachment to the good books I've seen it used for cover-wise.
    It might not play that well in this specific deisgn though. \r\n\r\nThe closest
    I can guesstimate on your treatment is ITC Avant Garde Gothc. Even in the ballpark?
    Thanks again.....\r\n\r\n"

    something very similar and I can't remember where \u2013 might be Linotype). The
    perspective is really wrong, especially noticeable on the top left square, I think
    it is because something with three point perspective now only has two points.\r\nTim"

    in photoshop. There are no gradients, Only strong illustration. If your design
    is strong enough you won't need gradients. It will have more staying power. \r\n\r\nAs
    for a font I suggest something like Trade Gothic Extended. Try the 2 color version
    of the icon and shrink it in relation to the type. Tighten the tracking because
    your icon is so spread out, you don't want the text to be also."
