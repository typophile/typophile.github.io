  body: Not even a guess?  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m wondering if this was a custom job. The
    client was the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Could have had the budget? Who
    knows. Maybe I should contact them.

  body: Only thing I could come up with was <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FF01105102P1"
    target="_blank"> Magda Clean</a>, but that&#39;s  <BR>no match... And nothing
    on <a href="http://www.lineto.com/" target="_blank"> Lineto.com</a> was close
    enough.

  body: I hunted in a number of places too , and didn&#39;t find anything with that
    sort of A &#40;in particular&#41;. The stencil look could always have been fabricated
    from the basic font, but I looked in both Indie Font books. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/max/"
    target="_blank">FontFont&#39;s Max</a> is  pretty close, but the A, C and R &#40;for
    example&#41; aren&#39;t right. <BR> <BR>I think your idea of asking them is a
    good one.

  body: I looked all over for this one...  <BR>I can&#39;t find it. darn. Ran it through  <BR>identifont
    a couple of times and still  <BR>nothing. <BR>I found a lot of similar stuff though
    but that&#39;s not good enough. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'It is indeed a custom job. <BR> <BR>From the exhibition catalogue: <BR>&#34;The
    title font, based on the letterforms on a 1940 California license plate, was created
    for the exhibition.&#34; <BR> <BR>The catalogue was co-published by the Los Angeles
    County Museum of Art and the University of California Press. It credits the design
    to Scott Taylor.'

  body: Thanks everyone! I appreciate the time put into this. I&#39;ve liked this
    face since I first saw it - kind of a bank gothic that&#39;s been ran through
    the washer a few times &#40;rounded corners&#41;. Thanks Jes
