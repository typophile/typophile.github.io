  body: "I really thought this font would be talked about more. I suppose it just
    strikes a chord with me -- it's everything I like about Gotham, News Gothic, and
    Whitney all rolled into one, and the price and EULA are just right. The only reason
    I haven't purchased a license yet is because I really don't have a reason to --
    I just want it!\r\n\r\nI drop by typetrust.com every day just to look at it..."
