  multiple sources as well. I originally guessed Meta, or Fedra sans.\r\n\r\nI think
  it's probably easiest to just present a few URLs, they use it for every header:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sun.com/software/solaris/get.jsp
  \   \"It's that easy\"\r\nhttp://www.sun.com/products/index.jsp     \"Get smart.
  Save green.\"\r\nhttp://www.sun.com/servers/index.jsp    \"Triple your capacity\"\r\n\r\nThanks

    and it's come up a couple of times before on Typophile. If you know what you're
    looking for maybe do a Search next time. ;^)

    (irrelevant) hit</a>.\r\nI\u2019d suggest removing the typophile search if it

    advice) seems to be a waste of time for both sides, no?"
