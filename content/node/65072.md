  for print design has a bit of a... design flaw. Or is it just me?\r\n\r\nApparently,
  long copy conforms to the baseline. (Without my asking it to! How convenient, for
  one thing.) But I find it a little weird that the Baseline settings are found in
  the Preferences menu. And that, unlike the type with which it works, Baseline is
  adjusted in increments of inches/picas/etc., and not, point.\r\n\r\nIs there a justification
  for this? It seems like a poorly placed control that's set up in a way that makes
  it harder to control. \r\n\r\n"

    setting.\r\n\r\nBy the way, have you tried to write something like \"14 pt\" in
    the \"Increment Every\" field?\r\nIt works."

    \"inches\" and \"points\" when counterparts to \"inches\" have always been picas,
    pixels, etc. At least, to the extent I've worked with InDesign."

    in.\r\n\r\nAnd anyway, you can turn off the snap to baseline setting in the Paragraph
    panel. But someone already said that."

  body: "It certainly sounds like you have set Align To Baseline as a default option;
    usually it is off, for new documents.\r\n\r\nThe settings in Preferences are mixed:
    some of them Document-wide, others Application-wide. If you change any preference
    (any at all! imagine!) with no document open, it'll become the default for new
    documents.\r\n\r\n<cite>.. unlike the type with which it works, Baseline is adjusted
    in increments of inches/picas/etc., and not, point.</cite>\r\n\r\nIts value is
    show in your very own preferred vertical measurement unit. One could argue that
    leading is measured in points in general (as well as in InDesign!), but one could
    also argue that the baseline grid is meant for the Respect the Grid guys, who
    don't care for leading but <em>want</em> to define this grid in their own design
    units."
