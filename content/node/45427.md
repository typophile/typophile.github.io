body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to create an ambigram for a logo for a bespoke, alternative
  wedding jewellery maker. The name of the company is 'Ivy Clara;.\r\n\r\nHere is
  what i've come up with so far, and unless I can fine tune this to read more clearly
  I think I'll abandon the ambigram approach. Before I do throw in the towel however,
  I thought I'd post it here to see if you intelligent people can help out at all.
  \r\n\r\nAny hints, or tips on general ambigram creation would be welcomed; as well
  as specific advice on the uploaded example.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nDavid"

    out the letterforms at all. I didn't notice any characters just a pattern.\r\n\r\nTry
    simplifying and smoothing out the character shapes. It's quite rigid. "

  body: yes, you do need to smooth out the shapes!Id start by reshaping the y... it's
    the harder to read.

  body: For something as difficult as "ivyclara", I think you'll find that even if
    you work out a really good ambigram, a lot of people still won't be able to read
    it, making it ineffective as a logo. But if you want to keep trying, I suggest
    centering it on "l" and you'll probably find better solutions. The development
    of an ambigram generally requires sitting down with a pencil and paper and doodling
    out as many bare solutions as you can find first, and applying style comes afterwards.

  body: It looks awesome, but I cannot read it at all. As Asvetic said, try simplifying,
    and try to make it more of a recognizable letter. For instance, when you separate
    the 'v' it looks like a stroke down that connects to 'i' to make an 'n' (make
    space between) and the right stem of 'v' looks like an 's'. Utilize spacing and
    don't disconnect letters. That should help with legibility. The style looks great,
    but it's a matter of refining, connecting, and shaping.

  body: "Thanks all for your comments so far. I agree that this looks too stylized
    so I've gone back to pen and paper to simplify. It still looks rather blocky and
    stylized but I think it is now easier to make out and will provide a better foundation
    to build upon and smooth out.\r\n\r\nI tried centering it around the 'l' but it
    just didn't seem to work. What I like about centering it round the 'Cl' combo
    is that i can make the C a capital letter and therefore help divide the word into
    'ivy' and Clara'.\r\n\r\nThis is just a scan (with a bit of photoshop) so it's
    very rough around the edges, but do you think it's a better attempt?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDave\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ambigram-sketch-6_6414.jpg]"

  body: "It's better than the previous, but could be simplified and cleaned up even
    more. ivy is still difficult to ready, and the Cl is slightly better but not much.
    ArA is the most readable. \r\n\r\nI think you might want to consider staying with
    all caps or all lower case. Also, use line weight to your benefit. Thick lines
    stand out, light lines disappear, this could help make certain character more
    obvious when in reverse. "

  body: I love your ambigram concept for a wedding jewelery designer. Your design
    has improved nicely. The latest posting is the first one that I could read the
    name clearly and not have to stare at it a few minutes to figure it out. Moving
    from a gothic-type of letter form to a more humanistic/organic was an excellent
    suggestion by aluminum. The second a in Clara needs some tweaking. Nice work and
    it's been exciting to see your progress. Looking forward to seeing the final version.

    design as it is, additional embellishments that don''t aid the readability start
    to distract from the message. (same for the swoosh attached to the y and r) However
    I do prefer the logo on the diagonal. '
