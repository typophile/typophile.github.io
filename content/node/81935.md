  body: "Nice work Ryuk. Often it turns out that URW has digitized many of the old
    film (photo) types. I think the reason is that, along with Bitstream, URW was
    one of the first foundries with the technology to digitize type. My understanding
    is that URW, with their Ikarus system, was contracted by other foundries to digitize
    type for them. Apparently they were allowed to keep and distribute versions of
    many of the typefaces as long as they changed the names. For example, Nimbus is
    their name for their version of Helvetica.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in an earlier
    post about brush scripts, URW has quite a few of these film type designs, and
    this example found by Ryuk is another example of how URW has revived or preserved
    many old designs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
