    some of them lately haven't been interesting here. ;^)

  body: "My interest in fonts seems closely related to enjoying seeing things like
    this and the lettering on the old cards, etc. I thought it might be the same for
    others here. \r\n\r\nIf you don't think most people would be interested, it isn't
    like I have too much time on my hands. I just enjoy sharing things. \r\n\r\nI
    have some great lettering samples amongst the 278 antique greeting cards I just
    got for 25 cents each. I will be adding several 300 dpi scans (approx 3\"x5\")
    on <a href=\"http://www.fontplay.com/freephotos/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">my
    website</a> each week, and if people are interested they can visit there."

    such a pooper sometimes. All I meant was that I know of several groups on Flickr
    that your pics would be great for. That''s all. '

    I'd be glad to add them there. I do have a new flicker photo account ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/fontplaydotcom/
    ). Is it permitted to add scanned images like the greeting card samples?\r\n\r\n(and
    should I still add them to general discussions?)"
