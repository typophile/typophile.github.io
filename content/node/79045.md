body: This is my first post on the board so if I'm doing something wrong I apologize,
  but here goes. A co-worker has been working on a project and is having absolutely
  no luck trying to match this font. I'm at a loss as for what it is because I can't
  seem to match it 100%. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

  body: Is your coworker on the console or telnetting/ssh-ing in from another machine,
    possibly another Unix/Linux box? If so, this could be one of the system's bitmap
    fonts. Mind, it could also be a Bitstream Vera Sans Mono that just got rendered
    flat.
