body: I've been trying to identify the fonts used on Hunters Wine (http://www.hunters.co.nz/).
  The text seems to be 'normal' Times New Roman. But i'm more interested in the larger
  font, used in the sentences 'Our story is the story of Marlborough wine' & 'the
  early days of Marlborough wine' I attached the image in this post. Does someone
  know the used font(s) here? Thanks in advance!
