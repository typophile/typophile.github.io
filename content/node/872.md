  body: As a type designer, I am particularly interested in mid-19th century &#34;moderns&#34;
    -- it seems to me that in what we have available today, in digital, there is nothing
    which has the extreme<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/13971.jpg"

    and in some instances &#40;eg the &#34;ar&#34; in March&#41; almost turn the italic
    into a script. So I&#39;m working on a &#34;modern&#34; that has these features.
    <BR> <BR>But perhaps it&#39;s alreadybeen done. Anyone?...

  body: I love Didot. Walbaum&#39;s x-height is too big for my taste, and I&#39;m
    not very fond of that little peak found in the strokes of most Bodonis. Plus,
    Didot is fun to say.

  body: I dislike Bodonis and Didots, generally speaking, but I have become fond of
    MT Walbaum lately.  <BR> <BR>Dyana, make sure you&#39;re looking at the Monotype
    version, which is based closely on one of Walbaum&#39;s text sizes, as opposed
    to the more prevalent versions, such as Linotype&#39;s, which is based on display
    sizes, or variations like Matthew&#39;s Wiredbaum or Newsbaum. I don&#39;t care
    for those myself. <BR> <BR>But the MT Walbaum makes an interesting book face --
    not general-purpose, by any means, but interesting and suitable for certain texts.

    better as a text. But looking at the letters purely as glyphs, I still prefer

    There are several &#34;moderns&#34; that don&#39;t really fit well with the usual
    &#34;didones&#34;. Fenice fits closer than some, in many ways, but it has its
    differences too, like the serifs which you mentioned, and the sloped roman in
    place of a true italic. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-fenice/"
    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-fenice/</a> <BR> <BR>Then
    there are other &#34;moderns&#34; that really seem to defy the usual classifications,

    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bernhard-modern/</a> <BR>
    <BR>There&#39;s also the oddly-named Goudy Modern, which would actually seem to

    Baskerville or Cochin than with the &#34;moderns&#34;. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/goudy-modern-mt/"

    what of fonts like Century, which are usually classified as Egyptians &#40;slab-serifs&#41;,
    but seem to have almost as much in common with Scotch romans and &#40;forgive

    <BR> <BR>Nick: <BR>The closest I&#39;ve found to the old &#34;moderns&#34; like
    the one you posted are fonts like Scotch Roman &#40;a close match&#41;, Modern
    No. 20, Modern Extended, and Monotype Modern &#40;probably the next closest match,

  body: '&#62;Nick, you mean something like this?  <BR> <BR>Not quite that extreme,
    although it does have interesting possibilities. <BR> <BR>I guess the sample I
    showed was a bit low res. The way it printed was really on the threshold of closing
    the aperture -- the serifs are so close together that sometimes they do touch,
    sometimes they don&#39;t, depending on slight differences of inking/pressure on
    different pieces of type on the page. In that sense, it&#39;s like Font Bureau&#39;s
    Giza. ie Let&#39;s make the gap really small. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s that &#34;hairline
    gap&#34; idea that interests me, and it could even be an &#34;optical scaling&#34;
    feature. <BR> <BR>My point is that the digitizers of faces like DeVinne backed
    off a bit, understandably, as they were making a single master version. But if
    you look at the l.c. &#34;a&#34; and its tail, that comes 1/3 way up the x-height
    in the c.1900 version, but 1/4 way up in the Bitstream version. <BR> <BR> <BR>
