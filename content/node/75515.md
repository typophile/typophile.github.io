  body: "When you say \"slanted\" are you referring to italic type, or to the type
    baseline being on a slant?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the old Federal Express' logo is the
    kind of thing you're thinking of. I did some design work for Federal Express back
    when they were using the old logo and one problem we often had was that the slant
    made the entire logo look crooked even when the bounding box was perfectly straight.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fedexlogos_5519.gif]"

  body: Yes, clean and corporate, linked to technology and premium segment. Something
    one could imagine to see on 5th Ave. or Bond Street (I am as serious here as one
    could possibly be... )
