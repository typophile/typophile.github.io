  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">When advertisers began needing speedy overturns of diverse fonts, designers had to come up with a quick solution. They would use old letterforms and amplify their appearance to make them look new. This solved the problem of getting the typefaces to the advertisers, but it did not result in creating well-made type. Most of the typefaces that were created were bastardized faces that eschewed classical typographical standards. Type must be legible and not simply used as background or gray matter, but as an instrument for conveying clear meaning. 

Three considerations have governed type design since the industry's beginning. Utility (how a face functions) and aesthetics, (how it looks on a printed page) both govern qualities of readability and legibility, while style affects what cultural code a typeface evokes. In the end, type is meant to attract and please.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mad_6032.jpg]
Nothing against Madigans, but any sign that cannot easily be read, fails in its overall purpose. Type is meant to be legible and accurately display the style and feel of the time and place, this sign does neither. 

The slanted and squished lettering makes the sign both illegible and unclear. If you can't read the sign, then there's no way of knowing what buisness is being advertised. The kerning is uneven and unpleasant to look at, and the only clearly decipherable letter is the "g" in the very middle of the word. This sign's lettering is uneasy on the eyes, forcing them to squint in and out of focus to try and make out what is written. 

Perhaps they should have tried to be less sleek looking and stuck with a more classic, unbasterized typeface. </div>

One theory. The neon is not on so they must be closed. I bet when the neon is on there is a world of difference in readability/legibility. The painted letters are only a backdrop, or foil, for the neon. Go back when it is on and see if it is better.

		<div class="commentbody">Michael, judging from another thread* it seems you're miffed at being seemingly ignored here. But you shouldn't be so hasty (it's only been about three weeks, and you've seen how long threads can survive on Typophile**) and certainly not so easily offended. I was in your position recently (actually much worse, since I had spent a fair amount of time thinking, scanning and writing) and lost my cool ever so slightly after two weeks, but managed to resume help two months after that, and eventually got an overly gracious response: http://typophile.com/node/51729

** http://typophile.com/node/2166

Ergo: you can't <em>force</em> people to respect you.
You just have to provide help for its own sake.

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Michael,
I am sorry if my response time was not prompt enough for you, I appreciated your comment and, yes it is better at night. I do not however appreciate the name calling and negative comments about my blog. Our beautiful and brilliant professors here at Loyola merely wanted to expose us to another aspect of design media by having us post our extra assignments on here. I did not mean to offend you by posting and running, but this blog is  just one part of the many time consuming projects that we as students must devote our time to. I hope that you can respect what we are posting in the future, and if you wish to comment please keep it constructive. No one benefits from childish insults or negative input. 
Thank you,
Jessica</div>

No one is disrespecting you, we're just a little frustrated with you professor's assignment.

We know you are students and this is merely one of the many tasks you've been assigned to do. That's the annoying aspect. Not your fault.
