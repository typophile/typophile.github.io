  looks rather '70s to me but I have looked through sever 100 on-line fonts and have
  not found it.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help you can provide."

    crossbars on the |A| and |E|) could be created from the following:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-curwen/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/Alexon/fonts/\r\n\r\nAdd
    the |R| from this typeface, and elongate its swash:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/orpheus-pro/alts-ii-bold/\r\n\r\nAnd
    the |S| from this typeface, and edit it a bit:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/edwardian/\r\n\r\nOr,
    you may just want to start fresh with similar typefaces from Letterhead Fonts
    or Font Mesa, which specialize in western revivals:\r\nhttp://www.letterheadfonts.com\r\nhttp://www.fontmesa.com/index.htm"

  body: "P22 Curwen is indeed a good base. Alexon is also good, but the stroke weight
    seems slightly closer in P22 Curwen.\r\nFor the _S_ consider the treatment of
    the stroke in Binner [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BinnerD_S_5984.gif] http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/binner/
    and tinker.\r\nFor _R_ mirror the lower stroke from _S_ and tinker.\r\nDon"

  body: "Did you notice the S shaped counters in the _O_ in the bottom line?\r\nThis
    design feature seems to have originated with  Nicholas J. Werner who designed
    the font Inland for the Inland Type Foundry in 1895. Your _O_ has a less emphatic
    version of the S counter shown in [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bizarrerie_O_4738.jpg]\r\nThis
    is from Claude Pelletier's  Bizarrerie, the digital version of Inland.  I can't
    link direct to the font. You have to go to http://abfonts.freehostia.com/ then
    follow the link to \"list of all fonts\" and find it in the list.\r\nDon\r\n"
