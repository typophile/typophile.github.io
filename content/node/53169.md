  body: Yes, most of them seem to be Frutiger, though many of the German signs are
    in Univers/ Helvetica nd one in Portland is Futura. In signage, sans-serif rules!

  body: "Hi Omar, thanks for linking to my article.\r\n\r\nMost typefaces used for
    airport signage is indeed <strong>Frutiger</strong>, first designed for Charles
    de Gaulle, Paris. Other typefaces that can be used for airport signage are eg.
    <strong>FF Info</strong> (Spiekermann), <strong>FF DIN</strong> (Albert Jan Pool),
    <strong>FF Transit</strong> (MetaDesign). I have seen uses of Helvetica and Gill
    Sans, although I find those typefaces not very suitable for airport signage. Good
    luck."

    for airport signage (D\xFCsseldorf airport)."

  body: "Seattle is Myriad, and it's too bold, like most signage type, especially
    when reversed out of dark.\r\nKatowice is FF Info. And i like the regular weight
    better than the bold above."
