body: I know there is at least one (maybe several) faces which contain mixed serifs.
  For example, it might have curved serifs on the acenders & slab serifs on the bases,
  spurs, etc. any names you could give me would be very helpful. thanks.

  body: 'I think I''m asking a more simple question. I''m looking for any faces that
    communicate duality or, old ->new, through a mixing of opposite type elements.
    So any face that integrates, sans & serifs, or curved and bracketed serifs, or
    very modern integrated with classical elements. If you have any others that would
    be great. Thanks. '
