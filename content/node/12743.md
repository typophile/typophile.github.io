  get your input for this one as well. This time it's a logo for myself. I'm starting
  a small web design business to earn extra money for school.\r\n\r\nThe logo will
  accompany a new design for <a href=\"http://www.gurrydesign.com\" title=\"Gurry
  Design\">my website</a> which I want to have a gardening theme. The idea is that
  I can help people \"grow\" their business with a well-designed website (sounds korny,
  I know, but it should be good when it all comes together).\r\n\r\nSo here are my
  two variations of the logo.<!--break--> Your thoughts and comments are much appreciated."

  body: Could it somehow say business and grow at the same time? While I do think
    the concept is interesting enough to pursue I wonder if at the moment it is too
    literally a plant.

    dollar bill in the shape of a leaf. Or a money tree. Or a ... what represents
    growth in business that can also be used to show growth in a garden?

    I'll give that some thought and see what I can come up with. If anyone has suggestions
    on how to merge the two ideas, I'm all ears.

  body: Peter also remember weeds grow too. Nobody wants their business to go  to
    the weeds. Also explore other options on your type. I think its too tight and
    I'm not fond of the all caps look. You might make it more accessible, friendlier.

  body: I'm with dan -- it seems like your choice of type conflicts a bit with the
    growing theme, and to an extent even the business of web design. to my inexperienced
    eye, it feels heavy-handed and somewhat utilitarian.. (unfortunately i'm not sure
    of what i'd suggest to help it)

  body: While I completely agree that the type -- in this instance -- seems heavy
    and perhaps clunky, I believe that the logo/illo should be solved before worrying
    about the typeface choice as the illo will, most likely, guide the type selection.

  body: Ok guys, I'm at a standstill. I've been trying to connect growth with buisness
    and I keep coming up short. I think part of my problem may be that I'm too attached
    to that pretty little leaf. I think the key lies in what Tiffany asked before,
    "What represents growth in business that can also be used to show growth in a
    garden?" I'll keep working. And by the way, I'd like to say that your comments
    have been refreshingly insightful.

    blossoming/growth, etc.? Integrate it into the graphic/symbol? The leaf would
    certainly be distinct in that setting, as long as you avoid your current gardener/landscaper
    thing.\r\n\r\nAs Tiffany suggested, a tree (long-term, strong growth) might be
    a good direction."

    fruit, etc.); my problem is connecting that to business. What are some things
    that show business? All I can think of are those generic photos of people in business
    suits climbing stairs.\r\n\r\nEben, I like your tendril idea, but I'm not sure
    people would know what it was. They might mistake it for a vine or even a coil
    and then the metaphor is lost."

  body: "I think that you may be treating the logo a little to litteral a manner here.
    You probably shouldn't be creating some frankenstein hybrid of a kind of platonic
    ideas/icons of 'business' & of 'growth'. Like a tendril making a dollar sign...
    god forbid. That might be okay for a spot illustration in some ham handed business
    journal- but not a logo. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of your logo aught to be to: \r\n\r\n1.
    <strong>Be Different</strong> I know I sound like an advert but it's true all
    the same. I1f your doesn't do this - especially as a designer - a basic tentpole
    is missing. Who are you competing with? Look at them & be different. Being yourself
    may well be enough.\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Be memorable.</strong> This is different
    than being Different. Really. This is the graphic equivalent of a catchy song
    hook. You want something that you look at & you find yourself looking again. It's
    not a trick - it's a behaivior of the eye you want & then of the brain. \r\n\r\n3.
    <strong>Be yourself.</strong> This is tricky & very subjective. You want to have
    a logo that you don't feel is false, a fake or feels like a sham. For instance,
    if you were a small neiborhood florist you might not want a chilly multinational
    corprate style logo. You would want something warmer, friendlier, and maybe more
    classic classy or fun. \r\n\r\n4. <strong>Be fast.</strong> A logo that takes
    too long to communicate or be understood is a deadly logo.  This is one of the
    reasons that a hybrid is out. It takes too long to understand & an impatient eye
    moves on. If the logo doesn't do it's basic job in the short time it takes to
    glance at it- it's not that great. I'm not saying it should be a pleasure too
    look at for longer - just that it needs communicate it's basic message <strong>very</strong>
    quickly.\r\n\r\nIt isn't key that an idea as such is imbeded in a logo. Especially
    for a service industry. Look at the most successful logos - Mercedes, Apple, DKNY
    - pick your own. You won't find an idea in almost any really successful logo.
    You will find they evoke a feeling in you. That feeling is enough. And a treatment
    of Type is often enough to create that feeling.\r\n\r\nIn terms of process I would
    make a list of words or phrases that describe the kind of assumptions that you
    want your logo to create in a viewer. Take stock of your target.\r\nMake sure
    it's the target you really want. \r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Peter, asking a web design business to grow business might be a little of
    an over promise, unless you are tied into marketing people and writers. I think
    the best you can do is offer website design as a tool to help grow a business.
    Even then you''d need statistics showing growth and percentages vs other kinds
    of sales promotion and marketing. I think I''d approach your web design business
    differently, something along the lines of "personal touch" or "one on one" design.
    Imply your designs aren''t cookie cutters but solve a businesses particular problem.
    Just some thoughts '

  body: Dan, that is a good point and I was thinking myself that to say my web designs
    can grow a business is a bit too ambitious. Although, I do offer eBay template
    design which really can contribute directly to more sales. That service is one
    I want to feature much more prominently with my new design. In any case, I really
    do want to set myself apart from other web design businesses by being personable.
    Being a one man show gives me some advantages over the competition, particularly
    that I can give more attention to my clients. That's something I do want to highlight
    on my new site and even in my logo. Perhaps it would be best to go for a wordmark
    rather than using some kind of symbol. What do you guys think?

  body: "It seems like a prudent way to go. \r\n\r\nAnd the wordmark's style can be
    such that it's clear that it isn't a rubber stamp sort of operation. What flavor
    of anti-generic are you? Caligraphy or Hnadwritting might be one way to go. Personal
    & unique each time. "

  body: "If I go the way of the wordmark it really is key that it stand out from the
    crowd. I'm thinking something friendly and personal yet still professional. Possibly
    a script, though a stylized sans-serif could work as well. One other requirement:
    it has to be cheap as this is all to <em>earn</em> money for school. Suggestions?\r\n\r\nHere
    are some I like:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000147\">Chocolate</a>:
    though too expensive.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000141\">Bello</a>:
    still too expensive.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000143\">Koziupack</a>:
    Similar to Chocolate above, and maybe a bit too fancy\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=LH.108016.0.1\">ITC
    Forkbeard</a>\r\n"

  body: You could also take an font you have & alter the letterforms. That's how the
    microsoft logo was made. It's a franklin gothic modified & with a bit cut out.
    That would be cheap. You could also work on a job & use some of the funds from
    that for the font later.... Having a logo in no way guarantees work. And taking
    your time wioth an identity is usually a good idea if you can swing it.

  body: Peter check out Font Diner. Last year Oscar Meyer used a Font Diner font for
    their summer campaign. Their fonts are display fonts and inexpensive. I think
    you could take one and modify it like Eben has suggested and you'd have a winner.
