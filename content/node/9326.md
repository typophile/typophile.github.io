  body: Wow! Do you have a link Franz? <BR> <BR>I thought it was something by Fontfont,
    but the closest I got was Danubia.

  body: '&#34;Goody&#34; seems to be a reinterpretation/remix of several Goudy faces
    such as <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/truesdell/truesdell/testdrive.html?s=CONSIDER+HISTORY.&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Truesdell</a> and Mediaeval &#40;sorry, couldn&#39;t find a digital
    version of that one&#41;, with a little Emigre playfulness thrown in.'

  body: Sorry Karen, no link, the name was embedded in the Flash file &#40;Goody No124,
    Goody No125 Cursive etc&#41;.. My guess is that they developed it inhouse and
    it won&#39;t ever be available to the public.

  body: Goody is also by our recently-discussed Jens Gelhaar &#40;of Alfa Sans fame&#41;.
    There is a sample of it shown in Roger Walton&#39;s &#39;Alphabook&#39;, published
    in 1999. I could scan it if people want to see it, but Franz is right on. It is
    based on the work of F. W. Goudy, as Mark suggested.

  body: I have a font called Goudy Claremont that bears a resemblance to the caps,
    but not to the Italic. It&#39;s by Richard Beatty. Sorry, I can&#39;t seem to
    find it anywhere on the web.

  body: yeah.  The italic happens to be the one i am in love with and Mark hit it
    on the nail with the Truesdell link as far as the caps are concerned. <BR>Thanks
    folks.

    target="_blank">Goudy Mediaeval</a>, too. It&#39;s easy to see where some of the
    look of Goody must have come from.
