  the letter forms in fontlab.\r\nI have finished the bold version of a font, and
  started designing the light version in illustrator so as to create a multiple master
  between those weights. The problem is that i cannot paste or anyhow alter one of
  the weights in the defined multiple master inside a glyph, in fontlab, when i do...
  the other instance is effected and when i paste the light letterform, automatically
  fontlab receives it as a separate object. Is there a way to create a multiple master
  by merging the final light and bold fonts, or is there a way to paste the light
  letterform as part of the bold's multiple master..?\r\n\r\nAndreas Kalpakidis"

    But to answer your question...\r\n\r\nYou can't just paste art into separate masters
    in a multiple master FontLab vfb file. It doesn't work that way, unfortunately.
    \r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is put your Illustrator art into separate FontLab
    vfb files, as if you were making two separate fonts. Make sure that the two fonts
    have exactly the same characters/glyphs present and that each glyph has exactly
    the same number of paths and nodes as its corresponding glyph in the other font.
    The corresponding paths in the two fonts should also each have the same starting
    nodes and path directions.\r\n\r\nImportant: Save both fonts before proceeding
    in case it doesn't work the way you expect. Some of these procedures don't have
    \"Undo\" and you may need to \"Revert to Saved\" to undo the damage.\r\n\r\nWith
    both fonts open in FontLab, make the lighter weight font's Font window the active
    window. Choose \"Tools > Multiple Master > Define New Axis...\", and choose \"Weight\"
    for type of axis (this is the default if it's the first axis you are defining).
    Then choose \"Tools > Multiple Master > Assign Master...\". In the dialog box
    that comes up, select Wt1 for the master and choose your bold font from the list,
    ignore the check boxes for now, and hit \"Okay\".\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, you
    will have your multiple master font with the art for your two weights set up as
    masters. If not, do \"Revert to Saved\" and try different options in the \"Assign
    Master\" dialog or check your outlines in the source fonts.\r\n\r\n(Disclaimer:
    This is not how I make MM fonts myself--I do all my drawing in FontLab. It should
    work, but if you run into problems with this method, I may not know the answers.
    On the other hand, there are probably others here who have worked this way and
    may be able to help. Assuming they are back from the holidays.)"

  body: Thank you very much this cleared my options, i will probably begin again in
    fontlab. But it is a pity that i have the fonts caps already designed in illustrator.
    Thanks again for your help.
