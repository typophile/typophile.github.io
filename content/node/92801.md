  is a typographic interpretation of the lettering style created by Dutch letter painter
  <strong>Jan Willem Joseph Visser</strong> at the end of the 1940s, which decorated
  the traditional brown bars of Amsterdam. In the beginning, these letters were strongly
  associated with the pubs connected to the Amstel brewery, given that Visser was
  the company's official painter. As the years passed, the style became increasingly
  popular, and various business owners in Amsterdam and other Dutch and Belgian cities
  also commissioned its use. In the 1970s and 1980s, <strong>Leo Beukeboom</strong>,
  another talented letter painter, continued and expanded this lettering tradition
  while employed under the Heineken brand. Much of his work can still be found in
  the Jordaan and De Pijp neighborhoods in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cafe-hegeraad_3743.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  <em>Amsterdamse Krulletter</em>, or Amsterdam's curly letter, is strongly inspired
  by the calligraphic works of the 17th century Dutch writing masters, of which <strong>Jan
  van den Velde</strong> was a central figure. However, distinct characteristics of
  this style, for example, its unusual and beautiful \u2018g\u2019, originate from
  a model that was published by <strong>Johannes Heuvelman</strong> in 1659, which
  J. W. J. Visser referenced.\r\n\r\nTypographic circles have somehow overlooked the
  <em>Amsterdamse Krulletter</em> and its heritage. The Dutch calligraphic hands preceded
  and influenced the formal English penmanship which has inspired numerous typefaces
  in the Copperplate style. In contrast, the models from van den Velde, Heuvelman,
  and Jean de la Chambre, among others, are a missing chapter in Dutch typographic
  history, and had never been turned into typefaces until now.\r\n\r\nConscious of
  the cultural and identity issues that arise in reviving a unique style, and concerned
  about the speed with which the lettering style was disappearing, Ramiro Espinoza
  focused the project of designing \u2018Krul\u2019 on digitally recreating the calligraphic
  complexity of these beautiful letters. Created through several years of research,
  \u2018Krul\u2019 is not a direct digitization of the <em>Amsterdamse Krulletter</em>,
  but instead, an interpretation that incorporates numerous alternative characters
  absent in the original model, and improves upon details where necessary, resulting
  in an optimal performance on the printed page. The typeface is presented in Open
  Type format, with an abundance of intricate ligatures, fleurons, and swashes, which
  permit the creation of numerous calligraphic effects.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sketches_4784.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  very high contrast and rhythm of the strokes in this typeface make it especially
  suited for media applications conveying a sense of elegance and sophistication.
  Designers of feminine magazines, advertisements, and corporate identities within
  the fragrance and fashion industries will find in this typeface to be an extremely
  useful and appropriate resource. \r\n\r\nThe great <em>Amsterdamse Krulletter</em>
  is finally back, and we are proud to make it available to you.\r\n\r\n'Krul' can

  body: "@ 1996type: Thanks!\r\n@ Nick: I lived in Amsterdam for about 8 years. There,
    walking down the Jordaan area, I realized traditional pubs and some stores were
    using a kind of script that was unknown to me. When I documented it and took pictures,
    it was obvious that the style was very consistent and there was probably an interesting
    story behind. Then, after finding and interviewing one of its painter (Leo Beukeboom),
    I continued digging up information from the Amsterdam Photographic Archives and
    getting information and documents from the relatives of J. W. J. Visser, the letter
    painter who created the style in the 40s. It is an interesting story and with
    some luck I will publish it. Cheers."
