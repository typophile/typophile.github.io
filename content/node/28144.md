body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TYPE1_3420.png]\r\n\r\nI'm relating to
  the definition of type crime made by Ellen Lutpon in Thinking with type book.\r\nI've
  seen lately some work with small caps used in the title form and I believe it to
  be a type crime, but I haven't found a solid explanation, and therefore I hope to
  have some contributions on the subject. I'm not assuming a radical position, I believe
  it is possible to use it in very specific occasions, but with serif fonts titling
  texts, or even with names and identity it looks like it makes no sense, and I can't
  find a convention that backs this sort of usage. Was it possible to do in the old
  days of lead typesetting? Or it is just one of those features that everyone uses
  only because it is possible to do?"

  body: "Small caps are optimized for use at text size.\r\nSo the effect might be
    a bit klunky at title size.\r\n\r\nOften they are more horizontally extended than
    capitals, which might be apparent at title size, and look odd.\r\n\r\nI think
    the best use of small caps for titling is to get the effect of optical scaling,
    one line of all caps followed by another of small caps.\r\n\r\nBeing a purist,
    I have never liked the mixture of caps with small caps in the same word. It just
    seems strange, I mean, there's no lower case with small lower case style. \r\n\r\nI
    don't know why CwSC looks odd, but it may be to do with the awkward fit between
    the two, especially involving the T. if you look at the words \"Type Crime\" above,
    the TY fit is actually quite nice compared to CwSC in many faces, but the way
    they reach out to each other seems mannered. This is not a criticism of this particular
    face, but the alphabet."

  body: "> Small caps are optimized for use at text size.\r\n\r\nNot necessarily.
    For example, in every Adobe Original typeface with small caps, the small caps
    are designed for use at the same size as the caps. In many of those cases, that
    may specifically be subhead or display size.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the caps-with-small-caps
    is most likely to look ungainly when the small-cap-height is relatively low, as
    in the example at the beginning of this thread. I am not against it in principle,
    myself.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "<em>Small caps are optimized for use at text size.</em>\r\n\r\nOK. Let me
    have another go at that: what I meant to say is that small caps are optimized
    for use <em>in </em>text, with lower case.\r\n\r\nIt's true that display size
    small caps are available, but as can be seen in this example, the small caps are
    beefed up to hold their own against the lower case, with the result that they
    are slightly too heavy, and too wide, to fully harmonize with the capitals. This
    is not a criticism of Robert Slimbach's elegant design and draftsmanship, but
    the recognition of what is perhaps an impossible situation -- to design a small
    cap that perfectly matches both cap and lower case. But perhaps it is more feasible
    with certain type genres than others.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MinSC_6458.jpg]"

    caps and small caps is often used for chapter headings. He does not censure them
    at all, but only has a few cautions: to take care about adequate spacing, to evenly
    space the transition from the full to small caps, and to avoid hyphens in titles.\r\n\r\nSome
    small caps look better than others of course. I was intrigued to hear Matthew
    Carter mention at the TypeCon critique session that he thinks that the small caps
    are the 'best part of every font.' "

    use that combination frequently and like it. I can see how kerning issues can
    come up with certain glyph and font combinations--a serifed cap T might look uncomfortable
    nearly striking the smallcap Y when a large height smallcap font is used. This
    would be a case-by-case issue though.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what Ellen Lupton
    meant.  Perhaps you might look back at her book and see the context, even capture
    a large enough chunk of the text to show us what you mean.  I don't have the book
    so I can't check.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: i believe it is generally considered a crime to use uppercase with small caps
    over here (in Sweden), but i think that mainly refers just to doing it in running
    text. i think it can be quite effectful in a display situation, but that certainly
    depends on the font and the design.

  body: "I think caps with small caps are classy if done correctly. As already expressed,
    if a word is set in a caps/small caps situation, it must be properly spaced. Also
    let's not forget about font choice. Using a font intended for long passages of
    text for display is a big no-no! For example using Hoefler Text in display setting
    when really you should be using the Hoefler Titling. (Yes there are caveats to
    this... and yes there are ways to make Hoefler Text look good for Titling but
    generally speaking its not advisable... its for TEXT!!!) Filosofia, pictured above,
    is a member of a choice group type designs where text/book faces scale well all
    the way to headline/display. When I go font 'shopping' I try to look for fonts
    that have this characteristic or they have 'optical' set like Adobe does.\r\n\r\nAll

    don't think any of them are ideal for this typeface.\r\nIn the designated small
    cap font the small cap is, as I said earlier, too wide.\r\nYou get better matched
    letter proportions by \"faking\" the display small cap with a downsized \"normal\"
    cap, but the stem widths don't quite match.\r\nMy preference for the best match
    is the Regular with SemiBold, although it might be a bit heavy overall.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EEees_5827.jpg]\r\n\r\nTo
    demonstrate that the situation is not a fault of any particular typefaces, but
    rather the outcome of the general habit of creating small caps primarily in relation
    to lower case, I've created an alternate small cap for Goudy, matched to the capital.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Eees_5219.jpg]\r\n\r\nThere
    may be other genres of type where the caps and small caps are better matched,
    and some typefaces where the small cap is matched to the cap rather than the lower
    case, but it is my opinion that in general, old style faces are configured like
    Minion and Goudy, making the use of caps/small caps in titling problematic, and
    requiring quite discriminating typography."
