  the display text. Your input will be appreciated. \r\n\r\nI have been looking for
  a situation where I could use Platelet for years! And have finally found it. But
  I need a good family to use with it for body copy, etc. \r\n\r\nI could use your
  opinions on this... it should be a sans serif."

  body: If they aren't being used in the same line, the compatibility with Platelet
    isn't very important. What is important is that you use a text typeface that is
    appropriate for your subject matter. So, help us help you. What is the project?
