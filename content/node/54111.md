  body: "The capital form is a bit akward with the contrast of terminals. Open capital
    Ps normally \"read\" closed, but because of the bar, I get this zigzag of white
    space that I think is what bothered me at the first look.  You probably need to
    let go of either the open bowl or the serif on the bar.  I agree with the choice
    not to cross it completely.\r\n\r\nBe aware that the lowercase form already exists
    as a scribal abbreviation.  I probably remember incorrectly, but I think it often
    stood for \"per\" or \"pre\" or something.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea
