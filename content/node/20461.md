  body: From having 250 kerning pairs in the MM font, down to only 89 in the generated
    instance, that is a significant lost. Can you tell, in general, which pairs are
    being dropped out?

  body: "It\xB4s hard to say, it seems new pairs are created that I never defined,
    and most of those I did define are gone.. It\xB4s totally screwed up. I make the
    MM font with the \"blend fonts\"-function, then generate an instance out of this.
    Is this the wrong way to do it?"

  body: "> <em>Is this the wrong way to do it?</em>\r\n\r\nNot necessarily. FL offers
    more than one way to put together a MM font; hopefully these will all produce
    a reliable source for generating instances.\r\n\r\nSince the issue here is the
    kerning data, when you blend the fonts, do any of them have kerning? If so, do
    the pairs 'overlap'? (Meaning, a given pair exists in both fonts)\r\n\r\nWhen
    you open a Metrics Window, you should be able to see the various kerning values
    for each master. Do they look alright?\r\n\r\nI'm using FL 5.0.2 Mac, and from
    the tests I've done with a 2-axis (4 masters) font, I had no problems. No pairs
    were dropped or added, and the kerning was interpolated."

  body: The two masters both have about the same number of kerning pairs with many
    having the same value, yes.. Most pairs exist in both masters, and they look totally
    normal to me. Maybe they fixed it in 5.0.2 then..  Thanks anyway Miguel!

    FontLab Studio 5.0.2. I'm not sure if they're MM-related but chances are that
    5.0.2 will help you. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Give this a try: (Can't promise it'll work, tho.)\r\n1. Extract the kerning
    of both fonts to .AFM files, before blending them;\r\n2. Blend the fonts, and
    then import the kerning back from each file into the correspondent master."
