body: Hi there, i saw this font today on a 1978 movie poster for the film "Piedone
  l'africano" (Flatfoot in Africa). I could not find out so far what font it uses.
  I do not assume that it is hand drawn, althought the two "O" do not look exactely
  identical. This could as well come from the poor printing techniqes. Can anyone
  help me identifying it? Thank you very much.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/piedonlafricano_6653.jpg]

    glyphs were made by modifying portions of Antique Olive Bold.
