  feedback on what i have so far. i still have to do lowercase, but the main idea
  of the uppercase is done. see any problems? this is my first typeface, so any help
  is greatly appreciated. i am currently working on tweaking each form.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/letters_6629.gif]"

    to make it read better. Some little bulb shaped ink traps in the tight angles
    might help too.\r\n\r\nA nice tall gothic overall. the little blobs on the stroke
    corners almost make this a serif font. It could easily be one if they were exaggerated
    a touch more."

    widen it?) W looks bottom-heavy. Top counter of A is probably too slight.\r\n\r\nStraight-left-side
    counters in P, R, B aren't consistent with E, F."

  body: "Given that it feels to be a very strong display face, a lowercase may not
    be all that important.\r\n\r\nIt definitely has a nice personality.\r\n\r\nThe
    only nitpik that I have is that there is some inconsistency with how the edges
    of the counters are treated. Some are rigid and straight, some are bowed in, and
    some (like on the B) are a mix. I'm not saying that's good or bad...just that
    it's something that seems to stick out.\r\n\r\nI agree with cuttlefish and eliason's
    comments as well. Do more with the Q and maybe vary a few of the others. The C
    might not need such large stems on the open side."

    are a few tweaks, taking in some of your suggestions. i have tried adding some
    small ink traps inthe tight angles (N, M, K) but i just haven't come up with anything
    that seems to work.\r\n\r\ni also haven't really been able to come up with any
    ideas on how to make the O, D, and Q vary more. any thoughts there?\r\n\r\nthanks

    the effect doesn't really apply. The tops and bottoms of the letters are flat
    and would probably look better lined up.

  body: "I think the \"smallest overshoots\" version is best (2.46pm).\r\n\r\nI would
    look at the letter that have diagonals coming into those seriffy nubs - I think
    you should reduce the size or otherwise knock back the obviousness of those nubs
    (I'm looking at the top of A and bottom of W). The greater change of direction
    resulting from the diagonal makes them too prominent compared to the ones on the
    vertical strokes."

    be a bit narrower (compare with the H) and the hood of the G could be longer (more
    down). Can the top of the A be opened wider so the sides are not vertical but
    less white space around them? I think I'd move the knee of the R down a bit and
    bring the top of the leg out away from the stem slightly.\r\nhope that's helpful
