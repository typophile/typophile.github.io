  body: I've heard "up style" as well for "Title Case"--though that doesn't mean it's
    right. Works for me, though.

    that is."

  body: I've come across Title Case in the context of linguistic orthography, not
    typographic style; it appears to be a proper term with rules to govern how the
    casing of digraphs such as LJ in Ljubljana should be handled, i.e. not LJubljana.

  body: "In the UK newspaper industry we would always prefer the \"down style\". The
    alternative, \"up style\" is seen as quaint, or Amerenglish, usage. But the extent
    of this varies.\r\n\r\nIn the pages of the Guardian, for instance, we would see
    President George Bush who is the US president. The Times, however, would refer
    to one as the President and the other as Prime Minister; \"cap specifics\" says
    The Times [which takes a cap on the article], whereas the [l/c] Guardian style
    guide comments that \"the tendency towards lowercase ... in part reflects a less
    formal, less deferential society\".\r\n\r\nFor those interested in matters of
    style, the Guardian style guide can be downloaded as a pdf, whereas The Times
    guide is for online reading.\r\n\r\nPersonally, my rule is simple: if in doubt,
    go low.\r\n\r\nKen W"

    Word</em> calls \"title case\" -- the rest of the world may have another opinion.\r\n\r\nNick:
    for prime examples of \"linguistic orthography, not typographic style\", go Dutch!
    The digraph 'ij' should be capitalized for proper names, at the start of a sentence,
    or at the start of a word in title case -- \"IJsselmeer\", rather than \"Ijsselmeer\"
    (just typing this last word makes me cringe).\r\n\r\nAm I correct in remembering
    these rules are not the same for all languages with digraphs? I.e., \"Aesop\"
    looks right to me, \"AEsop\" does not."

    \ Sentence case or down case is standard in Portuguese and Spanish and most other
    languages that I know of for being used in title case.  In English the general
    rule is to capitalize all words except for articles and short conjunctions (a,
    an, the, but, and, of, in, on) except where these are the first word in a phrase.
