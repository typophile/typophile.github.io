  brochure is called a thousand words. The idea is that it stresses the importance
  of words, following from the saying that a picture is worth a thousand words. The
  opening spread says 'some words are worth a thousand pictures'. We have chosen an
  illustrative style made up of text which I am quite happy with. I am just still
  wandering how to treat the type on the opposite page. At the moment it is just white
  out and quite structured which is in contrast to the more chaotic illustration style.
  Does it need more creativity? is it too clean? does the colour take the emphasis
  from the illustrations?\r\n\r\nany feedback much appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5867.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_5379.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_3771.jpg]"

    though is a bit too much, I mean there is too much stuff. The other two are cleaner,
    and look much better!"

  body: I like it overall, especially the illustrations, which are really great. I'm
    not crazy about the typeface for the headline. The color block doesn't bother
    me, it is a good contrast to the illustration. but the choice of font, and typesetting
    in the block of color needs work to me. Great direction though.

  body: "There's a typo on 'public' (pulic) but I guess you would have caught that
    one! I'd agree with Chris - not loving the main headlines. Could maybe do with
    the leading turning up a couple of notches, and the type seems quite 'spindly'
    at the current weight. Excellent illustrations, and I think they really suit the
    layout. I do agree with Pilar that the third is not quite up to the same standard
    as the other two - it seems much 'blurrier' and less distinct.\r\n\r\nOverall
    though, great work - this is definitely well into the tweaking stages!\r\n\r\n[<a

    Its kind of our corporate font so it is limited what can be done, perhaps smaller
    and increased leading?\r\n\r\nthanks so much guys, this is really helpful. Hopefully
    havnt issed you on this thread to get your thoughts on the revised.\r\nRog\r\n\r\nincreased

  body: "This stuff looks great.\r\n\r\nAgreed opinion on the headlines.\r\n\r\n\"Pulic\"
    is better than the more common misspelling of \"public,\" which is often mistyped
    as \"pubic.\" \"Pubic relations\" are also not always tangible either, so maybe
    that could work out in your headline as well.\r\n\r\nA quick run of spell check
    is always a recommended and easy step before showing a draft! (Although it would
    never catch \"Pubic Relations\" as a typo!)\r\n\r\n: )"

  body: "I definitely prefer the larger version - the small headline looks a bit lost
    though. I think the text block was better being closer to the headline too, as
    in the original. To be honest, I think the spacing problems with the original
    headlines were least noticable in the spread that you've amended - it's the 'Public
    Relations' spread which really suffered due to the repeated capitals being so
    close together.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n\r\n[<a href='http://www.semibad.com'>semibad</a>]"

  body: "OK cool, I think I shall try and increase the leading slightly and just be
    more careful in the clashing caps. Cheers for the feedback. Its amazing what you
    miss when you have been staring at it all day!\r\n\r\nI think your right about
    the other image not working as well. I think it could work, just needs work. Maybe
    slightly more minimal? Also, its less chaotic and random than the others. Almost
    less expressive.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think in the third illustration of the man the mid-tones are not as defined
    and the photographic quality that gives these illustrations their (beautiful)
    zing is lost. The shaded side of the face merges into the hair, which merges into
    the neck shadow; the transition from the lips to the neck gets lost in the highlight
    of the shoulder (?); both of these areas overpower and confuse the rest of the
    illustration. Actually, I think the problem is that there is too much--the other
    two are mostly the face, with the positions of the rest of their body implied
    in an energetic and expressive manner, whereas the third one's shoulders, hands
    and neck are all there and the facial expression becomes secondary. The other
    two really have the beautiful drawn, penciled quality. \r\n\r\n...sorry, that
    had nothing to do with the typography.. but hope it helps still."

  body: "LisaO, I agree, it needs a little more work and I think your right about
    the intricate detail. More is less I think in this instance. Some of the first
    illustrations were just too chaotic and needed to be simplified a bit and this
    is the case here as well probably. Much appreciated.\r\n\r\nfi, see what you mean.
    I guess I wanted really large type, and have thus tried to squidge some words
    in to fit the grid. It would be a far better solution to reduce the size. Thanks
    for the feedback."

  body: "Hi Fi,\r\nwhat do you mean work inward?\r\n\r\nI always start with a grid
    to be honest - I think in this case it is a 4 column and then the type set into
    2. I always try and start with a grid and work the type that way, and then change
    it if the type works better in another grid formation. The illustrations actually
    were done before I typeset the brochure so they dont follow the grid too much.
    Have tried to overlap them  bit as I thought otherwise it looked too seperate.
    I always use a baseline grid as well although I suppose in this layout because
    of the small amount of text it is not needed as much. But this always related
    a bit to the heading size and leading. That what you mean at all? \r\n"

    the outset? Deciding on the grid seems like an outer constraint (a general underlying
    structure). The \"inside\" for me is the specific location on the page of various
    elements. I sometimes feel like I'm just \"pushing boxes\" as they say. \r\n\r\nDo
    your grids depend mostly on the page proportion?\r\n\r\nI'm curious as to how
    other people get started. \r\n\r\n"
