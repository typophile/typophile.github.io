  body: "According to [[http://www.bastillebastille.com/music/|their website]], the
    font is called \"bastillefont\". As many of this kind of job, it is deeply rooted
    in [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]]. This one looks mainly like
    a redrawn/roughen/hand-shaped version of it (see printscreen below).\r\nAs you're
    mainly after this kind of /A (which could easily be done starting from /A, removing
    middle crossbar and \"closing\" the resulting triangle): [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/diamonds/|Diamonds]],
    [[http://26plus-zeichen.de/en/fonts/tj-evolette-a/|Evolette A]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/matchandkerosene/lightyears|Lightyears]],
    many ones at [[http://www.tendollarfonts.com/|TenDollarFonts]] (TWOFACED, Echelon,
    Rathe, Parqa, Fonecian, Finding 57, Harf 77, Labieno, Positano, Marina, Alumia...)\r\nMore

    Thank you for not simply linking words like \u201Chere\u201D or pasting URLs.
    Writing like that is what will keep people coming back for more, and increase
