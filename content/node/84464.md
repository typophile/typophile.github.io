  body: "Nevermind, I figured out how to fix it.\r\n\r\nI compressed the kerning and
    apparently it converted about 1500 pairs into classed-based kerning, so the number
    of pairs I had went from over 6000 to 4800. This got rid of the FATAL error. I
    also noticed through experimentation that the error didn't appear until I had
    over 6000 pairs, because I started working on a previous one with about 5900 that
    was fine. When it went to about 6,005 I tried generating the font, and boom, there
    was the error.\r\n\r\n6000 is the limit aparently."
