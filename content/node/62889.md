body: Can anyone recommend a squarish humanist sans serif? I'm looking for a design
  with a thick-to-thin contrast similar to Franklin Gothic Book (notably a, b, n,
  and r), but less oblong/rectangular in the overall shape of the characters.

  body: You could take a look at the [[http://typophile.com/node/28458|Comments On
    Camingo Typeface - Attack of the Square Sans]] thread from a while back. Most
    of the square sans serifs aren't really very humanist, but maybe there is something
    in the list that you like.
