body: "This is something that has bugged me in the past. When I'm working with multiple
  masters in FontLab, and I'm creating a new glyph, or a new path in a glyph, there
  doesn't seem to be an easy way to transfer what I've done in one master to another.
  For example, let's say I've drawn this path in the Wt0 master:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wt0e_6694.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  looks good, but if I now switch to the Wt1 master, I get this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wt1e_5081.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  path that is the result of the initial points I dropped when creating the path in
  the other master. Any changes I made in the other master are not reflected in this
  master, which makes sense. The whole idea of having multiple masters is for them
  to be different. However, I must now perform most of the same clean up I did in
  the other master to get this to where I want it. In the past, I would switch on
  the option to view the other master at the same time, like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wt0wt1e_3470.png]\r\n\r\nI
  could then use the other path as a guide when creating the version for Wt1. It works,
  but I could save a lot of time and effort if there was a way to make an exact copy
  of the path from the other master as a starting point. Unfortunately, FontLab doesn't
  seem to have any way to do this. However, last night I discovered a simple method:\r\n\r\n1.
  Copy the glyph or path you want to duplicate in the other master.\r\n2. Create a
  new (single master) document and create a new glyph.\r\n3. Paste the glyph or path
  into the new glyph slot and then copy it.\r\n4. Go back to the original (multiple
  master) document and paste the glyph or path into its original location.\r\n\r\nThe
  path on both masters will now be identical. Note that this will affect <em>all</em>
  masters. I don't know if there is a way to do this with some but not all masters.\r\n\r\nThere
  may very well be some other way to do this, or maybe others have discovered this
  trick, but I thought it was a pretty good solution and might be useful to other
  people."

  body: I don't work directly on the master either. Changes on WT0 always seems to
    bugger-up WT1, or atleast I can never predict how the tweaks will cascade through.  I
    tend to make font file changes and regenerate the master as well.

  body: I'm not sure I follow either of you. Are you saying that you work in a single-master
    file for each of the two weights and then combine them into a multiple master
    version when you want to see how they interpolate?

    in the masters with multiple master FontLab files. It's really not that hard,
    except for occasional puzzlers like the one above. I find it to be incredibly
    useful to see how the interpolation is working (using the Axis panel along with
    the Preview panel and the quick preview in the Glyph window). I worked with four
    masters the entire time when I did Proxima Nova."

  body: Kartsten, that looks excellent and much more flexible than the workaround
    I came up with. I should have known there would be a Python script somewhere that
    did this. Or more likely I did know and forgot about it. I'll try it out. Thank
    you!

    other master is all messed up, so I use Tools>Multiple Master>Expand Master in
    order to have the same exact glyph in both masters. Then I just work on the master
    Wt1 to design the boldest version. And I do the same both for width or weight
    axis. This works for me because I'm sure that the points are in the same relative
    position and the paths have the same direction.\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems,

  body: "Now I feel dumb. I never knew what that command was for (and obviously never
    tried to find out). It certainly isn't evident from the name. But there it is,
    right in the manual. So, never mind about my clever workaround. It turns out FontLab
    can do that. On a positive note, I now know about Karsten's brilliant script,
    which provides a lot more control, so it wasn't a complete waste of time.\r\n\r\nI
    wonder how many other \"clever\" workarounds I do to replicate features I don't
    know about? :-)"
