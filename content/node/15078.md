body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a humanist stencil font, preferably one including
  a true italic. \r\n\r\nThe job is an identity for three women setting themselves
  up as a curatorial team, with a focus on painting and textiles.\r\n\r\nI quickly
  drew some letterforms for the pitch (see attachment,) but I'm not a type designer,
  and I don't have the time or the money to invest in developing it myself so I need
  to buy something that already exists.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

      I drew, but I'm looking for something with a little more contrast, and slightly
      more feminine or with a few more flourishes. \r\n\r\nI also like Underware's
      'Auto 3' and unless I can find anything else, I may choose between the two.\r\n\r\nThanks
      though.\r\n"

    and they accepted, but no typeface exists!? Congratulations You are now a Type
    Designer! Get to work! Otherwise it seems like you've gotten on the plane, the
    door opened, now you're wondering why you decided to do this jump without bringing
    a parachute or acquiring training. :)"

  body: "David, you're right, I was rash to pitch a font that doesn't exist. \r\n\r\nI'm
    going to roll up my sleeves and go for it. It will after all be a good learning
    experience for me, albeit an expensive and punishing one.\r\n\r\nhrant and Chris,
    thanks for your suggestions."

  body: I would just make sure that your client is up for that journey -- it could
    be a long one, especially if it is a road you have never taken. Best of luck.
    Be sure to post your progress in the critique section, there are many here who
    would be more than happy to help you out.

    world, or you're an extreme undiscovered talent in type design, get somebody to
    help you, pronto! Otherwise you might end up in the book \"Type Specific II\"...
