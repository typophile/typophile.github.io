body: "I'm working on a pro-bono logo for an indigenous women's co-op that makes and
  sells traditional Mayan textiles, down here in Central America. They've all been
  victims of physical abuse, abandoned by their husbands and left to fend for themselves
  and their kids. My wife is helping them get their stuff to market, I'm helping them
  improve their identity.\r\n\r\nWhat I would love from any of you type wizards is
  suggestions for is a typeface- free or not- that immediately screams: \"intricate
  masterfully hand-sewn embroidered goods!\" I really like Expletive Script (attached
  below) but I've had some feedback that it doesn't reduce well.\r\n\r\nSo far my
  only other contender is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/josh-grzybowski/hennepin/|Hennepin]],\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/admich-expletive-script_5768.png]"

    of the co-op?

  body: "[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/fig-script/|fig script]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/november-script/|November
    Script]] are similar geometric monoline scripts, but while they fit the embroidery
    bit, I'm not sure they says handmade or intricate.\r\n\r\nHow about something
    more organic, like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/so-prolix/|So Prolix]]
    or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/chic-hand/|Chic Hand]]?"
