  body: Well, you need to find out how greek penmanship is performed with your chosen
    ductus. The axis is not the same as in the latin script. Once you figured that
    out you start sketching. As it is now the axis of the lower-case letters are all
    over the place, they should be more uniform, as you would not write with such
    deviating axis from letter to letter. Well, and then there is a lot of other stuff,
    but first start over with the lower-case.

  body: "A question for those who do Greek typesetting these days \u2013 I hope you
    find this thread:\r\n\r\nWhat's more popular, the \"classical\" or the \"contemporary\"
    ductus?\r\n(Here are two examples by two of my favourite designers, Slimbach and
    St\xF6tzner):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greek_ductus_5030.png]\r\n<br
    /><br />\r\nI always hear that the Greek shouldn't \"accomodate\" the Latin, for
    it's a script in its own right \u2013 but I feel that the trend goes towards adapting
    the stroke axis commonly used for the Latin lowercase. So far I went with the
    \"classical\" style, but I'm wondering whether there are any opinions on that
    choice before I go on.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSebastian"

  body: If by 'contemporary' you mean using a stress-axis similar to antiqua for the
    greek, I say nay. It just looks wrong, just as the greek stress-axis applied to
    latin would look weird. Andron, I'm afraid, is an example of how <em>not</em>
    to do it. If you want to design a contemporary greek then think along other paths,
    other ideas that stays sympathetic to greek scribal tradition.

  body: By the way Sebastian, I think it would be a help if you set some sample text,
    then it's much easier to see what pokes out at your eye. You can use the optical
    spacing in InDesign in lieu of kerning. The thing is that you can easily kill
    a design by over-harmonizing it, it can become generic, and it's much easier to
    evaluate in a test simulation its intended usage. But I like where it's going.

  body: "Thank you, Claus, for your help so far!\r\n\r\nI've been looking at whatever
    Greek prints I could find on Google Images (papers, magazines, books), and it
    seems to me that nowadays most text is set in sans-serifs, slabs and low-contrast
    fonts. Toss in a didone-ish headline here and there \u2013 but you don't see too
    much \"traditional\" Greek. Is that true or just my bad luck? I've read [[http://typophile.com/node/33869|this
    thread]], but I'm still not sure.\r\n\r\nI'm asking mainly because [[http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Haralambous/HHaralambous.pdf|Hector
    Haralambous]] has offered to help out with Polytonic Greek and Cyrillic, and he
    suggested looking into more \"contemporary\" and \"less calligraphic\" Greek design.
    He has yet to send me an example of what he means by that, but my point is:\r\n\r\n-
    I don't know what Greek typographers want\r\n- I don't know what Greek readers
    want\r\n- I don't know what mathematicians want (a separate glyph set altogether?)\r\n-
    I don't know what matches best with the Roman (is similarity desirable?)\r\n\r\nI've
    done some proofing \u2013 I don't have InDesign and its optical spacing unfortunately,
    but I will upload some improved PDFs soon. Right now, the letters look pretty
    much like in the last sample. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"

  body: "Oh, I know, I know ... it sounds like I'm looking for <em>The Answer</em>.
    Really though, I was just hoping for some guidance. Anyone can look at serifed
    Latin letters and make their own ones. But it seems Greek typography is a hopeless
    mishmash of foreign creativity.\r\n\r\nCrimson is intended to be a traditional
    text typeface, and therefore the Greek should follow the \"standard\" of Greek
    book printing. If someone told me, <em>\"80% of books you buy in Greece today
    look like Andron, and that's what people are used to\"</em>, then I'll consider
    going with that pen angle. Similarly, if someone wrote <em>\"stick with Slimbach's
    style, it looks best to Greek eyes. Screw Latinization!\"</em>, then that helps
    too :)\r\n\r\nOr maybe the Greeks are used to seeing ten different letter styles
    and don't really give a damn as long as the page looks nice and even ...?"

  body: Greeks rarely agree with each other so the thought of 80% agreement seems
    implausible, to me. My relatives could never agree on the best way to cook a leg
    of lamb, I don't see consensus on typography being any easier :-)
