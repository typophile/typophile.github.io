body: "In Preferences: Generating OpenType: Kerning, I have checked the option that
  says \"Generate OpenType \"kern\" feature if it is undefined or outdated.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
  whenever I generate the font, at the end it pops a dialog saying that the kerning
  has changed and do I want to regenerate the OT kern feature. Yes Fontlab, of course
  I do.\r\n\r\nHow can I keep this dialog from appearing?\r\n\r\n"

    select TOOLS &gt; KERNING ASSISTANCE &gt; Rebuild [kern] feature...

  body: You might not want to regenerate the kern table, if you have removed the kerning
    info everywhere but the OT feature, in order to make a font with only OT kerning.

  body: Problem is that the answer is not always "of course I do", like when generating
    kern feature with other tools than FLS5, when the answer is "of course not". :-/
