body: "hey, i'm looking for a font that i've seen before but can't seem to find an
  example of. i'll try my best to describe it, so please bear with me.\r\n\r\nthe
  most prominent feature are the O's...there's dot in the center and a diagonal slash
  through it. the outlines aren't clean, they're a bit squiggly, and it's a solid
  color. i had originally thought that it was the type used on the old Bloodwars card
  game, but i was wrong.\r\n\r\nif you guys could help me out, i'd totally appreciate
  it."

  body: It doesn't have the O you're looking for, but you could do worse than <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=ff+merlin&image.x=0&image.y=0">FF
    Merlin</a>.

  body: "actually, i'm looking for something pretty specific, it's for a tattoo.\r\n\r\nand
    it's not quite so squiggly (based on the 'd' and the 'g'), but thank you for the
    effort."

  body: "no, nothing like kadonk.\r\n\r\nlike i said,it's only similar to BO, but
    the slash on the o is diagonal and i don't believe there's so much frilliness.\r\n\r\nand
    i could have sworn i found the font on <a href=\"http://www.1001freefonts.com\">1001freefonts.com</a>,
    but when i looked the other day, it's nowhere to be found. i'll have to look again,
    i s'pose."
