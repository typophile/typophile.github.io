  body: "Without asking the reason for that specific square type, I'd give some opinions.\r\n\r\nThe
    'm' stands out the most. Perhaps it is due to the shortened central pillar. You
    may want to lengthen that and see where it goes from there.\r\n\r\nThe spacings
    need looking into as well. The e-l and y-l look tight.\r\n\r\nnagfa"

    could you tell me if you like this letters at all?\r\nOr it is not worth my time
    and I should make another type."

    type? And the long presentation instead of putting smyl beneath daniel?\r\n\r\nnagfa"

  body: "I think the lettering style looks cool - I guess it just depends on what
    you want your logo to say about you. I see \"modern\", \"friendly\", \"slightly
    techno\", \"systematic yet playful\".\r\nI like the stacked version. I also enjoy
    the n-i pair and how your \"a\" is the reverse of your \"e\". I would tweak the
    kerning a bit here and there: I think you need to tighten up d-a and s-m\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"

  body: The /l/s look too close to the other letters. I see the appeal of the tight
    interlocking in the stacked version, but my eye still gets hung up on the fact
    that, serifs aside, the EL and YL spacing is far far tighter than any other letters.
    Consequently it looks a little smashed in on the right side.
