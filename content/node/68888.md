  body: "My impression is that this is not a font. I believe this is hand-drawn. Without
    more letters, and with no repeating letters, it's almost impossible to know, but
    there seems to be an unsteady look to the strokes and yet the connections fit
    very well, for this to be a font (especially the le ligature). To me, these two
    things are inconsistent.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
