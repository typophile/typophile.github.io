    Trade Gothic Condensed 18, but this is way taller and the \"D\" and \"N\" are
    much different (among other things)"

  body: "Another quite close one seems to be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/wearetrippin/|Wearetrippin]]
    which I found not by looking at \"more fonts like this\" for either of the choices
    already given, but instead for Huxley Vertical - some faces resembling which I
    had found in what Headline Condensed brought up.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems to be
    Heroic Condensed - the letter spacing is not as tight as Headline Condensed.\r\n\r\nI
    looked through the ATF 1923 catalog just in case there was some traditional face
    that this also resembled, but I couldn't find one there."
