body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nWe're having a new logo designed by a local agency
  and they've chosen to put our company name in a custom rounded sans. They said all
  the stuff you'd expect about a friendly, approachable, modern tone. I wasn't immediately
  sold on the idea since many companies these days are opting for roundy sans serif
  fonts (like Xerox using FS Albert). \r\n\r\nSo I got to thinking well hey maybe
  they're right to choose this kind of font, even if everyone else is trying to be
  personable and informal, why shouldn't we too?\r\n\r\nAnyway my two questions are:\r\n\r\n1
  \  What fonts would you recommend that are slightly rounded, with simple shapes
  and a one-storey a? The company name is IMA International and I think they're going
  to set it with the ima in lowercase and the INTERNATIONAL in uppercase below it.\r\n\r\n2
  \  Am I over-worrying about choosing a style that seems to be everywhere or should
  I be happy that this kind of font does in fact represent our company values?\r\n\r\nAs
  always, I look forward to anyone's suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n\r\nPS Can't
  post an image of their home-made type currently but will try to get the pdf from
  them."

  body: "Thanks for the vote of support!\r\n\r\nYes my company knows I'm a font geek!
    Maybe that's part of the difficulty because I don't want to sound picky about
    something nobody else really notices. And if I was the designer I'd hate the client
    to jump into my territory.\r\n\r\nIllustration/logo stuff is not something I can
    do so I chose to get the agency involved. I really like their logo and the type
    is passable, I'm just not sold on the idea of the friendly rounded thing and the
    execution is slightly spotty (no optical correction).\r\n\r\nI suppose I could
    have a go, but there are nine or ten glyphs to create and I don't know if I can
    do the right 'mood' of font in the time given (a couple of weeks before our 2010
    brochure gets finalised). I'll have a go of course but I was really looking for
    a ready-made font or any opinions whether roundy ones are pass\xE9 or appropriate.
    We are a whole lot more personal/organic/unique than Xerox!"

    for the record, I think your company should value having a specialist \r\non board!

    not what you want. It's rounded but \"different\". But maybe not fresh enough."

    think Bryant works quite nicely too, it's just a lot softer, less perky.\r\nPersonally
    I think Montag's too cute, and too wide. \r\n\r\nBut you know, salt and stuff,

    that together from the pdf screengrab here as I haven't installed Mint at work!
    But you're right, perhaps Semibold would work better for the smaller text.\r\n\r\nThe
    agency had also removed the tittle from ima, to improve the visual structure I
    guess. We'll see what they think works best. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: Mint has nice stuff going for it. I think maybe your A is too wide compared
    to the other caps in INTERNATIONAL. Oh and the up stroke--left diagonal--should
    probably be thinner to relate well to the N and the horizontals. Try doing each
    alone and both, in context of course, and see what you like best...

    my company or the design agency who my company is paying to do the logo? I haven't
    released fonts before so this is exciting and a bit unknown."
