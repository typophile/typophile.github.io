  does anyone have any advice? and also, if anyone has any links on a how-to kerning
  primer, that'd be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\n// Ed\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beth_6422.gif]"

  body: "Kerning is definitely in the eye of the designer, but some tips to get a
    more atheistic appeal to your letter spacing would be,\r\n\r\n1. turn the type
    upside down and stand back (atleast 30 inches) from your type, the spacing between
    words should become more apparent. Squinting your eyes will also help.\r\n\r\n2.
    Remember that the spacing is the negative space between two positive shapes, so
    the letterforms will usually dictate if spacing should be tighter or looser. (Edit:
    I meant to imply that the negative space should be balanced based on how much
    positive shapes are around it.) Don't be afraid to tuck letters into each other
    if you feel it'll be balanced visually better (such as under the cross of a T
    or the arms of a Y).  "

    with the previous and the following one.\r\n\r\nI agree with Asvetic, there is
    a problem with the T and the Y."

  body: My recommendation would be to tighten up the Z and A and the B and E in "Elizabeth"
    and the O and Y in "Lloyd".  Other than that it's looking good.  Like Avisetic
    said, just stand back and look at how everything looks all together.

    others who have greater credentials than i):\r\n\r\ni would tighten up the I-Z-A-B
    string and certainly the L-O-Y-D string."

  body: "You could also look at visually centering the type, the curve of the D (because
    it is curved) looks further from the edge than the E. When kerning you should
    also consider the final size use, too tight kerning at a small size should be
    avoided.\r\n\r\nTim"
