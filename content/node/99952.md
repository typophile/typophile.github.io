  body: "I would say the logo needs a lot of improvement. Stroke widths are inconsistent,
    diagonals are inconsistent as well. Take a look at the way letters are constructed
    and then rework your lettering. Logo, Font & Lettering Bible by Leslie Cabarga
    is a good source of information if you need some reading about font designing.\r\n\r\nRegards"

  body: "Thank you both for your replies! I tried to be more consistent. I checked
    all the measures using a sphere as a measure tool. It would be very interesting
    to read the book Graphirus mentioned, but I haven't got it at the moment and the
    logo is a rather urgent task to do.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MORE2_5820.jpg]\r\nIs
    it any better now? "

  body: "Well, not quite :) It's for an art and music festival in Venice.\r\n\r\nI
    prepared some sketches for the client and he pick up this one.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MORE_sketch_5398.JPG]\r\nIs'a
    a really free sketch, perhaps too free, but in a way it suits the festival. So
    my task is to vectorize it. And now I see that there might be more than one vector
    interpretation.\r\n\r\nIt's not an easy task for me so I would very appreciate
    any tips on it.\r\n"

  body: "I guess it's hard to know what \"level\" of that sketch the client actually
    liked: the overall with the random wispy bits, or the \"core structures\" that
    can be guessed... If it's the former (which I personally would hope) then I might
    suggest constructing this with hundreds of fine lines that criss-cross and jump
    around.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Just a random thought \u2014 the O seems to be the focal point and I wonder
    if it could be made larger and become kind of a picture frame for various festival-related
    images (paint brushes, musical instruments etc), either contained within or projecting
    out. Could be the same each time or could vary."

  body: "@JamesM: you are joking, aren't you? ;) This is already in a bad shape without
    any additional stuff.\r\n\r\n@Vykintas: what's the story behind this signage?
    Is it just something \"they liked\" or is there more to it? Does it have any meaning
    as it is at the moment? Because first and foremost I couldn't even by being totally
    whacked relate this to a music festival... And especially not Venice. :) But hey
    that's just me. And no offence I'm just asking directly without wrapping it in
    nice paper. It's supposed to get you through quicker and to better result."

  body: "Ya I agree with hrant in keeping it raw to the sketch as possible. It reminds
    of my first graphic that went international ...very gestural letter shapes.\r\n\r\nI
    quickly ran your sketch through Ps to punch up that line work and keep as much
    shading as time would allow (GO BRUINS GO) and then in Illy did a trace...\r\n\r\n<img

    might of tweaked the /E/ n'stuff just a touch.\r\n\r\nn."

  body: "> you are joking, aren't you? ;) This is already in \r\n> a bad shape without
    any additional stuff.\r\n\r\nI had an ulterior motive. To be honest, your logo
    looked to me more like a logo for a machine shop than an arts festival. Sorry,
    but that was my reaction. So I was trying to think of ways to keep the same general
    treatment but add some elements to give it a look which I associate more with
    festivals (fun, energetic, colorful, artistic, exciting, etc.)\r\n\r\nBut I find
    5stars' sketch (suggested by hrant) an interesting direction to explore. It's
    softer and more artistic looking. Maybe try some different media (charcoal, watercolor,
    etc.) Or maybe juxtapose rigid, carefully-drawn elements with hand drawn ones."

  body: "Wow ! I didn't expect so many comments. Thanks to all of you !\r\n\r\n@hrant
    : It's the \xAB core structures \xBB that we are interested in. But the \xAB hundreds
    of fine lines \xBB \u2013 it's really an idea ! Is it technically possible (not
    too complicated at least) to accomplish that in TypeTool3 ? I mean I guess technically
    you cannot have a line in TypeTool ?\r\n\r\n@litera : It's something they liked
    :) I should have added that electronic music is going to play an important role
    in this festival.\r\n\r\n@5star : Thanks for the sketch ! The core forms are really
    more obvious now.\r\n\r\nAnd there's a technical question. Is it possible to automatically
    round corners in TypeTool ? Of course I would adjust and polish them after it.
    But automatic corner rounding would be a very good tool to get the initial impression."

  body: Well, actually there are some thoughts to develop the logo into a typeface..
    So perhaps it would be technically too complicated to have such a lot of points.

    dead... Which means you end up with a lot of points. But since it's a logo and
    not a font there are no technical limits to worry about there.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
