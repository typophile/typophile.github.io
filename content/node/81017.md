body: "Hi all,\r\njust wanted to get some professional words from everyone.\r\nThis
  is Fitz, an old style, single stroke width slab serif.\r\nIts a single stroke width
  throughout - and I'd like to keep it that way - unless I add little ink traps or
  feel the need to optically modify some strokes.\r\n\r\nI've actually finished all
  the upper & lowercase characters but I've only set up this png.\r\nI want to include
  some alternative glyphs but at the same time I want some good default characters
  - the Q & K come to mind as having swashes or alternates.\r\nI'm also curious about
  your thoughts on the variations of b/f/m/s & the single serif of v & x.\r\nIgnore
  the earless g and first t, I don't like them at all.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeface_5634.png]\r\n\r\nI'll
  post more soon.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

  body: "First t isn\u2019t so bad! :-)\r\nAs for the single serif on v and x, they
    need to be see in actual words. I think v could work, not so sure about x (have
    you tried to remove the bottom right one too?). And what about poor w, so full
    of serifs!? ;-)"

  body: "riccard0,\r\nI think the first t is a bit tall. but thats not a huge issue
    in the face of some of the other characters.\r\nDo you think the w has too much
    congestion there?\r\n\r\nThere is no change to the previously posted image, just
    additional letters to complete the upper & lowercase alphabet.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/specsheet-April8th_4665.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
    working on my old style & lining numerals and some other punctuation."

    don\u2019t ;-)\r\nAbout w: if you go with a single serif v, I would expect a similar
    treatment to w too.\r\nOther letters: I would discard the middle X and the middle
    M, and both first z and Z."

    lighten the colour a bit. \r\nThanks for the advice on the X/M/Z & z. I'll get
    to putting these characters into a workable font and see what happens.\r\n\r\nI'll
    post more soon.\r\nThanks again."

  body: "You'll probably want to harmonise the widths a bit more. The counters of
    /eco/ are quite a lot rounder than the narrow /bdpqs/. Personally I'd bring up
    the middle of the /a/ to make the bowl larger, but I can see that's a design choice
    you've made already.\r\n\r\nAre the rightmost legs of /mn/ sloped outwards?\r\n\r\nD
    needs some help. I like the second Q. \r\n\r\nWould need to see a pdf to give
    deeper crit. But keep going, try setting words or sentences, it looks like you
    have an eye that will resolve some of the parameters. Don't hurry."

  body: "Bendy, I've included a pdf attachment in the initial post. Same as the png
    in my previous post.\r\n\r\nZoom and critique as much as you'd like, I'd love
    detailed feedback.\r\nThe counters & elliptical shapes of the round characters
    I agree with. I'll fumble with those a bit more.\r\nThe m/n & h do have sloped
    legs.\r\nThe D admittedly, needs lots of help.\r\nThe tittles are slanted. Thats
    changed to simple circle.\r\n\r\nDo you see the rightmost G leaning a bit too
    much to the right? I'm not of fan of the middle tail, by the way.\r\nW/X & Z are
    more problem characters. I don't know which - if any - is stronger than the other.\r\nWith
    some adjustment, I might include all the Qs in the glyph palette. Just 1 will
    get the default of course."

  body: "My opinion is that Fritz resembles Kina mainly because of similar glyph proportions
    and especially weight which seems to be spot on.\r\n\r\nBut shapes are different
    even though at this weight they diminish. If Fritz comes out not only as thin
    but also as light, regular bold and black it will become more distinctive from
    Kina.\r\n\r\nRegular weights usually set shape differentiator.\r\n\r\nP.S. Even
    though Kina is more uniform compared to the current state of Fritz I don't like
    it's ball terminals. Seem odd on those letters. I see lots of dots because of
    them."

    use ball terminals (that niche has been recently filled by Archer and Bodoni Egyptian,

    of Kina as an inspiration.  Other than that, looking good."

    & p based on the o.\r\nThe grey characters are where I started and the new, preferred
    characters are on the furthest end.\r\nI'm a little weary they might be a little
    too open, thats a huge counter. But maybe it'll expand well with different weights?
    Either way, they match the e, c & o better.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/popqoq_6179.png]\r\nI've
    still got to improve my b & d to keep it in the family.\r\n\r\nThe progress with

    based on the relationship with the rest of the set.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aaaaa_4420.png]\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

  body: (In my first post) I've attached a slightly updated version of the font with
    a bit of sample text. The kerning is a bit off on some of the important pairs,
    I realize. Anyway, the letterforms themselves are much more mature. Only slight
    changes to make there.

    tail of the Q is a bit too close to the contour & baseline.
