body: 'I have a question for those involved in corporate design. <BR> <BR>Is there
  a reason &#40;better still, a good reason&#41; why business documents are so badly
  prepared? I&#39;m not talking about glossy annual reports, which get a real design
  treatment &#40;though they&#39;re often awful too, but differently awful&#41;, but
  about ordinary reports, etc. These are in many businesses &#40;such as mine: I&#39;m
  a lawyer&#41; the &#34;product&#34;. This is the only tangible thing a client ever
  actually gets for the many thousands of pounds/dollars/euros they pay professionals
  like me. But they generally bear the brand of their origins, in the form of unadjusted
  Word setting. Often right down to the smallest gory details &#40;huge bold italic
  arial headings, nasty little superscripts for dates etc&#41;. <BR> <BR>Why should
  this be? I realise Word cannot produce typographical beauty, but it can be set up
  to produce something less horrid than it normally does. And there must surely be
  room for fonts other than Times and Arial, which between them account for 95% or
  more of such stuff. <BR> <BR>Do businesses hire designers to advise them on how
  the software should be set up &#40;margins, justification, font-size, leading, styles
  for headings etc&#41; and what fonts would be appropriate? If not, should they?
  If they do, why is the result of this process a uniformity of dull nastiness even
  more grim than that which prevails in book design? Is it thought necessary to be
  &#34;familiar&#34;?'

    up  on a corporate design for a international lawfirm. I&#39;m just finishing

    is exatly Arial and Times...  <BR> <BR>So I couldnt stop laughing when I read
    your question. The answer '

  body: Paul, I can&#39;t talk about anywhere but here, Manhattan, USA and the Metro
    area, but law firms here look to hire kids fresh out of school with little or
    no experience. The only requirements are they know MS Word and Powerpoint. They
    are generally told to make the new document look like the old one. Why? They don&#39;t
    want to spend the money for a real seasoned designer.

    the lawfirms, or other businesses like that, that dosn&#39;t wan&#39;t to pay
    for a real designer.  <BR>Even though everyone knows its all about first impressions
    and the way you look when your facing out...  <BR>If you wan&#39;t to be taking
    serious... look serious... <BR> <BR>

  body: 'I find it odd. These firms are not averse to spending large sums on public
    relations. I bet they spend a fortune on the design of brocures and letterheads.
    They just don&#39;t seem to be alive to the possible value of decent design in
    the very documents their clients actually read. <BR> <BR>I was wondering if it
    was a conscious thing, a sort of &#34;anti-design&#34; statement: &#34;This is
    serious stuff: look, it is untouched by a designer&#39;s hand.&#34; If so, it
    seems odd. Have you encountered any of that sort of reaction, Mark?'

  body: 'I think the thought process is something like this: <BR> <BR>If I pay for
    it, I want people to notice the design. But the business documents can&#39;t be
    &#39;design-y&#39; or &#39;flashy&#39; so why pay for them to be well designed?
    <BR> <BR>Now, the choice of a good typeface, and the setting of a well-crafted
    template that copy could be poured into is, in my opinion, very well worth it,
    but to them it may not seem like it matters. Also, I&#39;ve run into people siting
    an apocryphal study that shows Times New Roman to be the &#39;most legible&#39;
    typeface. Who knows where that came from...'

  body: That one I recall vaguely. There was a readability study decades ago that
    compared several typefaces, and of those compared, Times was the most readable.
    However, IIRC, it was also the only general-purpose text face in the lot. <BR>

  body: Yeees ... Now no doubt there are studies that say serif typefaces are more
    readable &#40;and, of course, ones that say they&#39;re not ... and so on&#41;.
    But I don&#39;t believe that anyone&#39;s been reading those, because they also
    say that setting type at 80 characters per line with 1 point leading is pretty
    hard to read and that doesn&#39;t stop anyone. <BR> <BR>I suspect it&#39;s rather
    the reverse. Professionals will think about Capital-D-Design when it comes to
    something like a logo or a brochure or a web-site; but they see it as essentially
    a form of decoration. The idea that typographical design might actually have something
    to contribute to communication doesn&#39;t cross anyone&#39;s mind. So many of
    the subtler possibilities &#40;since good design in that sense would not be incompatible
    with &#34;branding&#34;, though it would/should not be branding that came first&#41;
    are simply ignored, because no-one realises they were there. People just copy
    other people like sheep. <BR> <BR>Or do people imagine that &#34;experts&#34;
    at MS have carefully set up Word so that it is typographically correct? It&#39;s
    not an unreasonable assumption. It just happens to be badly wrong. &#40;Unless
    anyone cares to defend 16 point arial bold italic sub-headings for 12 single-spaced
    times text?&#41; I have to read this stuff every day until my eyes bleed. We have
    ergonomic chairs and desks. Is it too much to ask for ergonomic documents?

  body: The problem, at least in America, is that most of us  lack any formal training
    in basic aesthetics. It&#39;s hard enough for us to get training in the arts in
    general, for that matter. <BR> <BR>We&#39;ll spend years and years learning writing
    style and guidelines, but we won&#39;t ever have a class teaching basic layout
    skills. What a margin is. What a serif is. Etc. <BR> <BR>This is something that
    should be especially taught in any business or business writing school. <BR> <BR>The
    other problem is a lack of training in basic office tools. Few people actually
    know how to use word, PPT and the rest. They just hack away at it. <BR>

    It&#39;s a basic skill everyone can and should benefit from. Clients already think
    they know what they&#39;re talking about. I imagine a few basic skills will enable
    them to see value in graphic design. '

  body: 'This thread interests me greatly as I work at the crossroads of professionalism
    &#40;Library &amp; Information Science&#41;, complex information domain &#40;One
    Canada&#39;s major public libraries with 22 branches and provincial resources&#41;,
    distributed document authoring and publishing &#40;public service units are charged
    largely with determining the items and the content&#41;, and little recognition
    of the value of design &#40;whether it be for building the percieved value of
    library services, communicating services or programming or whether it be internal
    communication&#41;. <BR> <BR>Factors that make printed business material less
    than stellar: <BR>  <BR>Speed <BR>Utility <BR>Deadlines <BR>Constrained budgets
    <BR>One person, many roles <BR>Percieved value by the producer <BR> <BR>All of
    these are inter-related. When confronted with producing a high volume of business
    documents one will rely on existing or proven practice. One will turn to tools
    to match the demands of speed and utility. All else will take a second place role
    to these considerations. The primary goal, even in white collar service products
    is faster, cheaper. Better rarely enters into it unless a strong business case
    can be made. <BR> <BR>My head explodes with thinking on this stuff. I love the
    mundane realms of typography and design: business documents, forms and related
    material. The work a day stuff that slide under everybody&#39;s radar. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    Paul for starting this discussion. <BR> <BR>But I have to go write a paper for
    my Technical Communications Course now. <BR> <BR>Jon'
