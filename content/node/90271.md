  in type for music notation. \r\nRight now I'm trying to find a parametric solution
  for the noteheads. Hope to keep this space alive with my results as soon as possible.\r\nBut
  there's so much to do still... I wish i could get done my script in a better and
  faster way. \r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/Schermata 2012-02-20
