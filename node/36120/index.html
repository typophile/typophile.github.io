		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey Chris, it took me a while to see the entire images, because I only see one part at a time (top or bottom two-thirds), but now that I have, here&rsquo;s my 2 cents'&hellip;</p>
<p>The fact that you have just one star makes it subtle. Was there a reason you moved the star from the white field to the red, besides making room for the text?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the green I see on my monitor is the one that will be used in print, but what I see now does not contrast well with the red background&hellip; The green should be darker, perhaps.</p>
<p>The typeface (is it yours? it looks like the one from your recent t-shirt!) looks a bit too friendly for an anti-war message. I would use something that looks rougher, and that way avoid having to use bullet holes.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ricardo,
The star was purposely moved out of place to show an ambiguity or foreignness of not belonging there. Both the American flag and the Iraqi flag have stars so I wanted to show the duality. Iraqi star becomes American star in a bait and switch (and a bit Texas lone-star).
Regarding the green on red&ndash;this is a juxtaposition of complimentary colors which is purposely bothersome. It is readable enough but not comfortable to see (like the war).
Yes, the typefaces are mine. The wider one is &ldquo;Fat Squeeze&rdquo;; the one with the bullet holes is &ldquo;Squeeze Trigger&rdquo;; the taller one at bottom is &ldquo;Tight Squeeze&rdquo;; and the light small caps are &ldquo;Now Sans Light.&rdquo;
I didn&rsquo;t want to be too grungy with the type. I wanted it to be more clinical. More like a bunch of fat-cat oil and defense mega-corporations silently profiting (getting fat) from the war.
It is meant to be subtle and require some thought. Getting into and out of war requires some thought.</p>

Not too sure of the placement of the type in relation to the horizons of the flag, the line ‘if it’s the last thing we ever do’ and the animals line seem redundant to me, if one recognises the song reference one knows the next line but including it doesn’t reinforce the message and the animals line is bizarre if one doesn’t know the song.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, I got the flag thing immediately before reading the posts but! I had a moment of hesitation as well between Iraq and Palestine (and another one but I won&rsquo;t tell which one, because I was completely wrong about the colours) sooooo, once I got the Iraq conection, the text really did the rest.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;m not sure you needed the &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s the last thing thing we ever do&rdquo;. Then I read Tim&rsquo;s posts about the song. I don&rsquo;t know anything about the song but that&rsquo;s my cultural references. The poster is obviously directed at Americans so if they all know the song, brilliant.</p>
<p>Not sure about the bullets either, too Far West? When I think about war I think about bombs, not bullets.
Didn&rsquo;t get the star leaving the flag either. I just thought it was an odd position in relation to the text. Having said that, the whole thing is very interesting.</p>

<p>I think it would be stronger without the &lsquo;we are the animals&rsquo; stuff, and including the &lsquo;if its the last thing we ever do&rsquo; that you had before. That phrase resonates for those of us who remember the song, and is more forceful.</p>
<p>And the layout needs work, whereas your original worked well as a design. Now the amount of red at the top makes the lines look unbalanced.</p>

<p>Kellie, You may have cross-posted and not seen the last image.  I took the &ldquo;Animals&rdquo; line out because I think it (as you said) can cause an ecology image. &ldquo;The Animals&rdquo; is the name of the 60s rock group who wrote the song (they are from the UK, by the way).</p>

I think the flag effect would look even better if you drop that green star in &ldquo;gotta&rdquo; and make the counter of the g in &ldquo;get&rdquo; a white star. This way it has the same configuration as the iraqui flag with the 3 aligned stars. Also, I would make &ldquo;this place&rdquo; white for the same reason.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chn,
Thanks for your comments. The point of the top star in &ldquo;gotta&rdquo; is to be out of place and the 2 stars only in the 2nd line shows something missing or un-whole. The eye/mind desperately wants to correct this by taking the green star away and putting it back where it belongs, with the other two stars. This is the effect I am after&ndash;take something out (foreign military forces) and give back the whole to the native Iraqis. It is meant to feel uncomfortable and foreign.</p>
<p>Regarding changing the last line to white&ndash;I tried that before and got a very wrong semantic from the word groupings. &ldquo;Get out of this place&rdquo; needs to be the same color to read properly.</p>

<p>I saw your poster and immediately knew it was for Iraq. When Canada sent soldiers to Afganistan, I saw these amazing postcards. It was the Canadian flag, except there was spattered blood instead of a maple leaf.</p>
<p>I think the stars are necessary to differentiate the flag from the Palestinian. I think the poster works for both countries in terms of land being occupied or controlled by expatriates.</p>
<p>I think &ldquo;We are the animals who are out of our habitat&rdquo; works best on the poster. Rather then green text on black, try white. This makes the middle the only part with green&hellip; just like the Iraqi flag. For more emphasis, stars should also only appear at the middle of the flag.</p>
<p>Hope that helps,
Ahmed</p>

<p>The bullet holes, they use a crescent shape, and therefore have a direct reference to the crescent moon and star which is seen throughout the muslim community.
I like the horizontal format although I got the vertical format immediately. The triangle of the three stars forms two groups of words. One group which reads &lsquo;We get this place&rsquo;, and the other group reads &lsquo;gotta out of&rsquo;. Which in my mind, echoes the crescent moon and star, in a sorta kinda way.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know about that Hiro. Too many concepts in my opinion. In the case of posters you&rsquo;re looking for a cohesive whole (not the sum of its parts). A lot of hidden meanings in a poster is not always a good idea. 
For this reason I would remove the period at the end too although I agree, in some cases a well placed period is like a slap in the face. The horizontal version is sooo much better!</div>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re aware Lore that visual references as an integral part of the overall composition, add interest. Intended or unintended. The trap most designers fall into is to be too clever/obvious or too linear as in having only one dimension. Good design should work on several levels - hit over the head and seduce at the same time [personal opinion]. An interesting read on the subject is, Symbolist Art Theories <em>A critical Anthology</em> by Henri Dorra.</p>

My method of distribution is to put it on variuos internet sites and Flikr groups so that anyone can print it and post it wherever they are. I have no money for printing but I figure if enough people either print and post it or send it via email, it may get some visibility. Not that much will happen because of it to stop the war but I just had to do something. Feelfre to blanket Canada if you like.</p>

It feels a bit uncomfortable to me in its' current size. If the purpose is to make it feel uncomfortable&hellip;I think it should be really uncomfortable by bleeding off the flag.</p>
<p>Another consideration— if this is to be printed large at a protest the boldness of the letters in their current size my make it very difficult to read from a distance. I don&rsquo;t know if this is a concern or not. I&rsquo;ll be at the protest on September 15 here in Washington, are you going?</p>

<p>It would have to be better than it was when I lived in Falls Church ten years ago.  That being said, I&rsquo;m not surprised: so many neighbourhoods are undergoing gentrification these days. Let&rsquo;s hope the sub-prime bubble doesn&rsquo;t burst all of the upscaling.</p>
