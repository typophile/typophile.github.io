I nipped into one (I think in Lecce) and was shown around by the elderly owner who showed me all his letterpress stuff, at first I thought he kept it fo posterity &ndash; but he explained it was all very much still in use for wedding stationery and church festival posters.

<p>There are a good many letterpress folks still in operation, more and more actually, though most of the newer entrys are using the photopolymer plate process.</p>
<p>I still have about four cabinets of medium- to larger-sized metal typefaces for use in broadsides and poster work as well as a very prestine collection of Klingspor&rsquo;s Claudius Fraktur and an extraordinarily large run of Ludwig &amp; Mayer&rsquo;s Dominante (which, as far as I know, has never been digitized).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>After some fifty-odd years of collecting effects for my printshop/foundry I&rsquo;ve got more stuff than I can list, but one part of the collection that interest most visitors is the shelf unit holding about sixty suites of Monotype Giant Caster matrices.</p>
<p>These are what most people in the &ldquo;private press&rdquo; area of interest would find to be ugly typefaces: Bodoni Bold and Italic, Jefferson Gothic, Onyx, Goudy Handtooled, Brush Script, Valiant, Franklin Gothic etc. Okay, even I think Goudy Handtooled is a little on the homely side.</p>
<p>A few days ago I had another art college class visit. The instructor zeroed in on the Brush Script and fell in love with the mats, showing them to his class. This box of Brush Script contains the rare Th and tt logotypes along with two or three others. The mats are all in the large size range of 42 to 72 point, and are punched aluminum.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do a sample casting of as many of them as I can to include in a little autobigraphy (ego, ego) I am writing and printing. This seems to me to be a good reason to drag them out and put them on the Super Caster, since they haven&rsquo;t been cast into for many many years.</p>
<p>One other oddity is a suite of about a dozen engraved brass mats which are large condensed figures: 10, 20, 30, etc. These are engraved in reverse into a checkered background. They look like they were custom engraved for use in horse racing betting slips or something like that. anyone ever seen this kind of thing???</p>
<p>I did have one nifty font of woodtype a few years back; a very odd size of 51 picas. I&rsquo;ve never seen such an unusual size before or since. They went on to be donated to an art school some years back. The school dumped the type along with all of the little printshop about four years ago. Dumb buggers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a box of miscellaneous Giant Caster mats containing a set of figures of Bodoni Black Condensed in 120 point. These were intended to be cast &ldquo;sideways&rdquo; on the mold of the Giant Caster. They won&rsquo;t fit on the Super Caster so I keep them as a curiosity.</p>

Try the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Type Museum<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Stockwell, they are based around Monotype but have collections from many, now defunct, foundries, and do demonstrations of punch and matrix making and casting. I was given a souvenir of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer cast on a pica em block, which they used as a demonstration of their abilities (unfortunately I&rsquo;ve never had the opportunity to print from it or take a satisfactory picture).

<p>I&rsquo;m proud and honoured to say that I own the word &lsquo;Bodoni&rsquo;tided up in a typographer&rsquo;s cord given to me be himself, and also a lowercase &lsquo;g&rsquo; of I believe to be a genuine 36pt Bauer Bodoni metal type specimen, and some others I´ve found, 12pt garamond monotype original (the fake garamond, jannon, we should call it&hellip;) and some others of Times 9pt I believe and still a gill sans italic monotype specimen (12pt?). I&rsquo;d love to have some more&hellip;. who knows&hellip;
Unfortunately I don´t have a camera good enough to take decent pictures to show&hellip;. sorry.</p>
<p>In Portugal there&rsquo;s Printing museum near Oporto, which I advise to take a look. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s portuguese&hellip;.. :(
