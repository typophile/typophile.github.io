body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5140.jpg]\r\n\r\nthis is an ongoing research
  i am making, of inventing new letters to the hebrew alphabet by using it's structural
  rules.\r\ni am experimenting with ligatures, different combinations of two letters,
  and also i brought up old writing systems that are the ancestors of the current
  hebrew language and alphabet - ancient hebrew letters, rashi letters, aramaic, and
  more. some of the best solutions to a \"new\" letter are older.\r\nmy main tool
  is calligraphy, because it allows me to understand the letter's structure and spirit,
  and because it is the best fluent and quick way to make a letter. ideas are transferred
  through the hand, directly to the pen.\r\n\r\nthe new letters have no functional
  need in real life - the hebrew language is fine with only 22 letters and 5 ending
  letters. but this research helps me in discovering new artistic ways of manifesting
  and articulating myself and do my humble contribution in developing the hebrew culture.\r\n\r\nyou

  body: as you said,  experimenting -- that's fine; lettering, decorative work --
    fine; but ligatures with text font I really doubt  this is going to work; same
    thing with  the last sample -- ligatures & cantillation marks.
