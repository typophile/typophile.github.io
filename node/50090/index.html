  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I was beginning to design a little booklet for my young son who&rsquo;s showing a new interest in letters and words at twenty-seven months of age. I started off using Chapparal then began to entertain other, wildly different, thoughts like Cronos and Century. I recently saw a children&rsquo;s book set in Licko&rsquo;s Journal Light that looked wonderful.</p>
<p>I realized that, unlike most projects, I wasn&rsquo;t sure on what I was basing my choices. What are the criteria that define a good font for young children learning their letters and eventually to read? Now, my son is clearly a genius of towering proportions, but let&rsquo;s limit the discussion to children in general.</p>
<p>I have some thoughts on the matter, but I&rsquo;d prefer to open it up and see where this goes. It&rsquo;s a fairly interesting topic in that the point and priorities of the uses of the font are distinct from more typical text, display, or whathaveyou faces.</p>

<p>I do think that there may be a point to using either multiple fonts or, more elegantly, a font with alternate letters (almost like the original Beowulf program). Kids may learn a letter best by seeing various glyphs for a given letter so that, by seeing what is constant and what isn&rsquo;t, they can arrive at the &ldquo;essence&rdquo; of a letter.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>After having designed 7 or 8 titling faces and doing many covers for a NY publisher of children&rsquo;s book I decided to design a thoughtful juvenile font that would speak to the time that I had spent with my children reading books. Two years ago I released Peanut through P22. Although one cannot have a favorite child this face definitely ignites the child in me. It may be less formal than what you are looking for but, what the heck, take a peek. It was truly a face born out of a dad&rsquo;s love for his children and their appreciation of their father&rsquo;s letters.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Peanut_3438.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, this is not a shameless plug. Just a reaction to the same sort of love that I have for my children&hellip; 23, 21, and 10. Maybe it is just dad reminiscing through type and lettering.</p>
<p>Are we getting old or what?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Christian,</p>
<p>My son is just a few months older than yours and also very interested in letters - to my delight.
As a designer I&rsquo;m of the everything but Comic Sans school.</p>
<p>I find that at that the really geometric fonts seem to work well - such as Futura etc - as they tend to come closest to what we think of the basic form of specific glyphs.</p>
<p>And while he can recognize certain letters in almost any font as long as they are uppercase, he has yet to grasp the concept of lowercase letters - in other words that there are two types of ABCs or more.</p>
<p>And numbers for now are also called &ldquo;letters&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Michael - nice typeface - like the name too.</p>

<p>Pure fun, simplicity (laced with a nod to the Roman forms) and a sense of the sparkle that I saw in my children&rsquo;s eyes when they looked at letters from early on. It is derived from a logo, and when I started lettering it I asked my kids  which shapes they liked in certain letters. I commandeered the caps so they may not be as much fun, oh well. I did not expect the reaction in the publishing industry, some of my clients used it instead of having me do lettering. What was I thinking :-)</p>
<p>To this day the/my favorite letter is the lowercase e. Kid like goofy!</p>
