body: "this is happening on a mac running 10.4.9. it's been happening for a while,
  and i've never gotten a reply from any of the fontlab people as to whether they've
  seen this happen.\r\n\r\nsee attached file. this is what my contextual menu looks
  like when i select a glyph cell and try to activate the contextual menu.\r\n\r\nalso,
  my application menu is split into two menus. one with the name of the app contains
  services, hide fontlab, hide others, show all, and quit.\r\n\r\nthe second menu
  is immediately to the left, and is accessed by selecting blank space (which is completely
  weird). it contains about fontlab, about fontlab products, and a menu divider followed
  by nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\ni have some contextual menu extensions installed, and i'm
  running some app enhancers (fruitmenu, menu master, windowshadex) which are all
  turned off in fontlab. i've also tested with all the extra stuff uninstalled, but
  the problem persists. anyone else had this happen?"

    request at fontlab. he says:\r\n\r\nthis is answered in our FAQ:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/contact-and-support/faq/faq-fontlab-studio-5-for-mac-os-x/\r\n\r\nit
    doesn't address the specific symptoms i'm describing by name, but it does repair
    them. problem solved."

    what I do is go to <strong>Tools > Customize...</strong> and clean it up.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FL_contextMenu_4610.png]"

    body: interesting. the fudged entries show up in there as well? i hadn't thought
      to look there since my initial changes there were still in place. i assumed
      it was strictly a render error.
