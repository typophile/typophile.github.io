  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am working on an identity for a seasoning salt shop. The idea is that people can come and mix their seasonings to suit their tastes (at the seasoning bar). It is important to stress the SALT part of the identity. I've come up with a lot of directions, but can't seem to symbolize salt without being extremely literal. How do I make seasoning look appetizing? I have an earth tone palette, but that is all I have going for me. I've ventured into the direcetion of meat (that changes with each use) + seasoning specks on it, but it might be too literal. Any help would be much appreciated.

Thanks

The name of the business should be your starting point - it's fun and unpretentious. You need to come up with something visually appetizing, think delicious food, not necessarily just salt. You need to post some designs if you want better feedback.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">it should show the coming together of spices, salt and herbs...

I've tried: 
• salt shakers
• mixing bowls
• the aroma coming out of bowls, shakers, meals
• combo of leaves + salt chrystal + spice
• top of salt shaker (s) or (f) for Flavorit
• meat/veggie icons with seasoning
• salt as a texture - granuals become letter forms
• combo of texture (one representing each: salt+spice+herb)
• mixing spoon/measuring spoon + salt
• changing the letter "o" in Flavorit to the top of a shaker (slot for each ingredient)
• sprinkling action of pinching/spreading salt (with/without hands)
• element chart
• molecular make up
• seasoning on plate/bowl/fork/spoon
• cubed salt
• ingredients stacking (with/without + signs)
• combining a leaf+salt grain+ spice icon
• lips/tongue
• turning the "i" into a shaker
• stamp like approach to resemble crates of salt
• swirl action of combining ingredients/topping off food

My immediate reaction to the subsequent 9 schemes is that the "f-ness" of the letter is best preserved in 1, even if it is less bold. I think it carries the concept best if you can immediately read the letter. My reaction to the sketches with bolder or fewer dots is that they don't work as well. Also, 2 and 5 have a heavy border: to my eye that steals thunder from the f. The ones with holes in outline don't seem graphically strong enough. It's an interesting direction to take with the crescent-shaped shadows in the last two, but I like the flat scheme best, as it reminds me of a large shaker with a handle whose top is flatter and not domed. What if the disc acquired some light tone? or what if the gray tone were actually a photograph of the wonderful off-white texture of the salt? Reall, though, it seems best to keep it very simple and clean, allowing it to appear in small ads in the local paper, etc.

Finally, as you refine this, might you consider shifting the axis of the vertical stroke just wee bit to the left? I know it is geometrically centered on the disc now, but since most of the "action" and dynamism in the glyph is happening on the right, it doesn't feel <em>quite</em> centered. I'm talking a very subtle move here, mind you. 

What an inspired idea!

Will you have any influence on the interior design of the shop? I once attended a brown-bag lunch at the Alliance Française and the speaker that day was an (American) architect who had lived for a time near Guérande in France where all the sea salt production takes place. Her friend owned an airplane so she went up with him many times and photographed the big evaporation areas from above -- it was like seeing the most amazing and beautiful abstract paintings! I'm sure such images are available through stock agencies and they could make a wonderful impression in the shop.</div>

Subtle or not, just look and place it so that it is optically in the middle of the circle. Especially when the strokes get thicker.

		<div class="commentbody">I think the proportions of the "f" in flavorit should match those of the f-dots symbol.
That's why I liked Futura, because the crossbar is low. You could tinker with the Futura "f", just for the wordmark--extend the crossbar to the left, and curl the top over a bit. Avoid anything resembling a ligature. The tag line would be good in Futura too, to stick with the modernist uniformity -- because your logo is a conceptual metaphor and hence modernist. The logo is also geometric modernist: the f-dots are perfect circles. Therefore grot types and those with square i-dots don't match. The principle here is to get everything to harmonize and reduce compexity at the same time. That all stems from the logo.</div>

I keep looking at the overall spareness and modernity of the shaker top and large word(s) in things like futura, and the following line in serif type. These traditional serif designs feel too "other", not clean and modern enough. what if you make the upper line sans lc in a big size, and then the lower line sans U/lc ital in smaller size?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This looks really good

The use of Futura is very sympathetic to the mark, especially if you visually match up the thickness of the shaker's outline with the stroke weight of the type. Your mark is clean, simple and clever which is complemented by Futura's monoline appearance. 

This treatment won't look 'too 1920s' to the vast majority of viewers. Your tutor's viewpoint and that of other design-centric observers on type is coloured by their own expertise and shouldn't be taken as gospel. 

Nitpicking:

– The type needs to be slightly bigger in relation to the mark, so it's slightly narrower than the width of the mark itself. If the lower line could be 'Customised seasoning blends' it could be set to match the width of 'flavorit' and by not explicitly mentioning salt you avoid the potential health stigma already noted.

– The three dots that make up the top curve of the 'f' might look better if the lower two are  aligned. The one that makes the very end of the curve looks like it has popped out of line whereas the other dots are very regularly placed.

– Slightly open up the kerning betwwen 'f' and 'l' to balance the word up

Good luck

ideally yes. It's admirable to try and please all the people all of the time, but is it necessary in this case to look for another typeface that does everything that Futura is doing in the logo currently, solely to avoid a small number of people raising an eyebrow over the date of the type? 

For a moment let's assume we want to do just that. The shop is contemporary, the product is not, so what timescale is appropriate? 

We can't pigeonhole salt in a particular time period so we're out of luck there. 

The shop however is new so do we say contemporary typeaces only? Confine ourselves to this decade? Should we choose a Futura-like geometric sans released as close as possible to the opening date of the new shop in order to be as chronologically synchronised as possible? 

I'm not for a moment saying that designers should indulge in glaring typographic howlers, but should Futura be reserved solely for works on 1920s functionalism? An extreme example I know, but where does one draw the line?</div>

Chris, there are several arguments for using contemporary typefaces for contemporary work, rather than old types.

One would be to preserve the integrity of historical allusion, which is the frame of reference which you mention.
Another would be to differentiate the product/service, so that it doesn't look like part of other corporations that use the same classic face.

The best argument for old faces is their "neutrality".

However, transcending reasons related to the job in question is a general professional consideration, which is that it's important for creatives to express their own time and place, and support their peers, such as photographers, illustrators, and type designers. (Self-interest declared, although I have yet to publish an old-school geometric sans.)</div>

It is never too late some say...

I honestly think the salt shaker Idea is a very good reference, both visual and conceptual. However, I feel the symbol is a little too obvious and literal. 

Have you tried the negative version of the symbol?, I think it would give it more presence.

What about, instead of having such an essential lowercase "f" in the symbol, you use a much more elaborate one? or an Uppercase? 
Something like giving the actual "f" some more flavor! 

Also, With a symbol with such personality I would keep the logotype clean, with a type without too much character.

Hope it helps.

Capital F or lc? Should Flavorit be the same as the dotted f as far as CAPS go?

Also, I think that the text should be as wide as the icon, to unite both elements visually.</div>

I'm wondering why you are justifying the logotype with the symbol.  The symbol might work best smaller and elevated away from the type a bit.  Also, stop with the scripts.  It gets too busy and detracts from the great symbol.</div>

I don't mind the symbol being so geometric, but how can I make the type look more organic? Is it possible to mix the two? The shop allows you to mix custom flavors and seasoning salt is usually applied with the hands, any way to give that feel without the script type?

This looks too clean:

		<div class="commentbody">In my oppinion there is no such thing as too clean. But maybe something as simple as italics or, stretching your font, would give you the feel you are looking for. A hand writen font might even do the trick.
