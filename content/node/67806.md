    example, there are dedicated mathematical fonts. Or others with exensive glyphs
    coverage in one area or another.\r\nYou could also look for \"STIX fonts\"."

  body: "Computer Modern is considered to look funny, and scientists are a conservative
    bunch. Modern No. 7 used to be very common, because that's what Monotype offered
    with mathematical symbols - and then they offered four-line mathematics for Times
    Roman.\r\n\r\nWhile there are now other faces which have had mathematical symbols
    provided for them, so that a choice is possible - from the American Mathematical
    Society, from Microsoft, and so on, as scientific publishing is utilitarian rather
    than decorative, font choice will tend towards the pedestrian. Baskerville, Caledonia,
    Century Expanded... dull stuff like that.\r\n\r\nOf course, before desktop publishing
    and laser printing, there were scientific publications banged out on Varitypers
    (yes, the metal shoe kind) and IBM Executive typewriters, for reasons of speed
    as well as economy."

  body: "You'll get a lot of Minion in <em>Nature</em> titles.\r\n\r\nMy company publishes
    a lot of social science, and tends toward the traditional Times, Bembo, Sabon,
    perhaps Stone. Of course a lot of the manuscripts come in from the authors in
    TeX fonts like CM, but that's a different story..."

  body: The Scotch Modern style has long been used, because it has enough shape (with
    the furling of its serifs), and space (with its hairlines) to accommodate a huge
    number of different character shapes, disambiguously. For instance, italic "a"
    and Greek "alpha" are quite distinct. And when a number of characters are close
    together at different heights, in mathematical formulae, the serifs don't accidentally
    merge, because the "pot-hooks" turn back on the glyph.

  body: "For me, it would be the typeface combinations supported well by TeX. There's
    good math/symbol support based on Utopia and on Minion, and those are <em>my</em>
    current favorites as an individual typesetting technical papers. (The four basic
    weights of Utopia have been made freely available by Adobe, but you'd have to
    purchase the basic Minion fonts.)  This [[http://www.tug.org/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/free-math-font-survey/survey.html|survey
    of free math fonts]] can give some idea of what's freely available with TeX, but
    some of those packages may not quite live up to professional standards in all
    contexts.\r\n\r\nI've seen many math texts set in Computer Modern and in Times
    (off the top of my head).  Perhaps also Minion.  No others stand out in my memory.
    I know that before the current generation of open-source math font support, there
    was commercial support for Times, Palatino, Charter, Helvetica, and Baskerville
    through [[http://www.micropress-inc.com/fonts.htm|Micropress]], and I've wondered
    if that's what some mathematical publishers have used, but I don't really know.
    Back when there were fewer open-source offerings, I had always wanted to purchase
    one of those packages, but didn't have the funds as a graduate student.\r\n\r\nst"
