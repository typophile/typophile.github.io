    cannot use the old printing plates, I saw a documentary about Mr. H.\u2019s book
    recently, where a film clip appeared showing the \xBBritual\xAB melting of the
    original printing plates at some date shortly after 1945. If I remember correctly,
    the metal was then used to print the first newspaper in the \xBBnew\xAB Germany.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    You can view the scene here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wtkfop4XHA starting

    artifact, it probably has merit\u2014in that at least some people found it a convincing
    argument."

    evoke what the original did when & where <em>it</em> was published, which means
    it cannot look exactly the same now. Think for example of what Trajan felt like
    <em>before</em> everybody and their neighbor's dog used the Adobe font for whatever
    the hell they wanted.\r\n\r\nNick C: Peons find convincing what they're told is
    convincing. That's why Democracy can't work.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
