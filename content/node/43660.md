  I mentioned it elsewhere, yet, this morning my thoughts returned to that subject.\r\nLately
  I met Mardersteig at Leipzig for his exhibtion in the Druckkunst Museum.\r\n\r\nI
  love the thought that you could get in contact with him or the Museum to offer,
  for\r\na special edition maybe, your beautiful Zeno? I know that you do not recognize
  it \u2018finished\u2019\r\nYet I do. I would love to see it just as it is now. Maybe
  threre are some defects when it comes\r\nto digitalzing issues (for commercial use)
  I do not think that there are defects - on the contrary -\r\nI do think its charme
  is the thing that counts!\r\n\r\nHave you ever seriously thought about it?\r\nIt
  is a beautiful version that you made so far as I remember. It struck me. \r\nPerhaps
  it may do so with other people, too.\r\n\r\nSalute\r\nStefan"
