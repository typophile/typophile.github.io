  change the typeface of its motto, &#34;Working for a Safer London,&#34; from italicized
  script to plain block letters on all its signs, cars and stationery because the
  current typeface is &#34;not compliant with the Disability Discrimination Act of
  1995&#34; in that it might prove &#34;difficult to read for visually impaired people.&#34;
