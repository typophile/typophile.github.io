    at MyFonts before I posted that, but it wasn't shown. Should have checked his
    site too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Glad to help Mike.\r\n\r\nWhenever I see a distinctive \"g\" I immediately
    think of Jocham for some reason. Guess I got lucky going right to his site.\r\n\r\nCan
    you explain the addition of {NAME} to the title? It's something new I started
    seeing today."

  body: "The person who originates the post can also edit the title to 'call off the
    hunt' by showing it's been solved. The admins used to do it regularly, but they
    seem to rarely do it these days. In fact, I added the font name to the title,
    after someone else had added the 'solver', so anyone who had read the thread would
    also see the answer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
