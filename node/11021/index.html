  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I bought a font today (Gabriel Martinez Meave's Arcana) and I'm trying to figure out how to make this work: I am running Mac OS 9.1 and have Suitcase 9. The font came in Open Type format and I don't know how to load it so I can access the full character set &ndash; Suitcase doesn't recognize it at all and when I loaded it directly into the System folder the extra characters don't show up. Does anyone know how to do this? Thanks for any help you can give me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You need the latest version of ATM, and an &quot;OpenType Savvy&quot; application. I'm not sure what the score is with Suitcase, but sticking the font in the &quot;Fonts&quot; folder in the system folder should load it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you're trying to use this font with XPress then forget it, it's not OT savvy. I think your choices are PhotoShop 7.0, Illustrator 10 or InDesign. If you aren't using those apps then you probably aren't going to get anywhere with extended characters - but the standard range should work with almost any app (barring some versions of Illustrator - 6/7 I think).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are three aspects to OpenType: the font format, the character encoding (Unicode), and the layout intelligence (OTL). Different systems and applications have different levels of support for these three aspects. Using the lastest versions of ATM, system font support or FreeType (the latter mainly for Linux), most systems are capable of installing the font format and correctly rendering the outlines. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Systems and applications with Unicode text processing will be able to access all encoded characters in the font. Applications with at least this level of support include all Windows NT/2000/XP apps, Cocoa apps on Mac OS X, some Adobe apps (InDesign and PhotoShop). Applications that do not support Unicode text processing will only reveal an 8-bit subset of the encoded characters (some may be able to reveal multiple subsets as if they were separate fonts). It should be noted that Quark Xpress does not support Unicode text processing. Neither does Illustrator, but it is considered quite likely that the next version will. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Applications that support OpenType Layout provide access to unencoded glyphs in the font via OTL lookups and features. Note that not all applications will provide the same level of OTL support, and a font may contain features that are not yet accessible in your OTL-savvy app. Currently, InDesign and PhotoShop provide the best levels of OTL support for non-complex scripts. The Windows version of MS Office provides the best level of support for complex scripts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen, Troy's question was really &quot;how do I access the extended character set&quot;, and the answer is &quot;in Quark you can't&quot;. The situation is as I stated, nearly any app (including XPress) can use the standard (8-bit) character set, except (specifically) some versions of Illustrator (which cannot use an OpenType font at all).</div>
