  and I can't make it bigger without it stretching so I'm just going to recreate the
  logo but I need to find the font to do that. I'm aware that it's blurry but I think
  you can still get a gist of what the font looks like.\r\n\r\nIt says \"Just Cleaning
  USA\""

    Poster]] anyway.

    body: That is so incredibly close. Closer than what I've found. The only differences
      I'm spotting is my J doesn't have the cut out near the ball at the end. Also
      the capital C looks a little bit curvier in this font. But thank you so much
      I can definitely use this font to help me search =]
