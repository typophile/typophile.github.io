  body: Looks nice, but why is there an accent on the last 'e'? If the name is supposed
    to allude to the french word of the same spelling, that last 'e' is silent.

  body: "The accent is correct:\r\nhttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Recherche\r\n\r\nImpressive
    font!\r\n\r\nI notice on MyFonts that with the \"quick brown fox\" sample and
    SS01 selected, it loses the \"x.\" Is that an error in the font or a misuse of
    how the stylistic sets are set up (or an error with the MyFonts engine)?"

  body: "Ah, so it is apparently in English. In French, there is no accent unless
    it's in past tense. Actually, now that I look at that link, it's only used as
    an adjective in English and describes things that are <em>researched and well
    chosen</em>. Thus explaining the past tense translation.\r\n\r\nEither way, nice
    font :)"
