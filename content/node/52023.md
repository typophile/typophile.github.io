  fine in the preview in suitcase, ligs work\r\nbut when I try to use in inDesign
  CS2, the metrics seem to drop out... \r\nthe ligs do work though\r\nso then i tried
  in inDesign CS3 and the kerning works...\r\n\r\ncan anyone explain this, or point
  me in the right direction\r\ni really dont know about proper export settings/process
  for fonts, so I might have tripped up something there...\r\njust weird that it works
  in CS3 but not CS2...\r\n\r\nmany thanks!"

    part.\r\n\r\nI've got caught on that before, it remembers your last font on exit
    and if it was set to something different with the new font loaded the metrics
    part is grayed out looking like you cannot change it. You can change it though
    set it to Metrics. "

  body: Wot coincidence. I was looking for information on kerning and got [[http://typophile.com/node/32929|this
    older thread]], which explains the difference between, yes, CS2 and CS3 kerning
    behavior.

    really sure what font cache is, but I have restarted, and shut down the machine
    many times, I assume that any cache issue would have been resolved by now..\r\n\r\nPete:
    I assume you are talking about InDesign, which I do have the metrics selected,
    not optical and not 'none'\r\n\r\nTheunis: thanks for the thread, unfortunately
    though I did not offer any jump out solutions for me... I am a real beginner and
    it seemed pretty complex. I am running fontlab 5.0.2, and believe that as the
    kerning works in CS3 it is not an issue with the actual font creation. I have
    to get the font to work in CS2 for a client otherwise it is useless...\r\n\r\nany
    more ideas would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nmany thanks\r\n\r\n"

    what I understand from the thread. That's exactly the point: The kerning system
    that Adobe uses changed between CS2 and CS3, and pre-CS3 versions might encounter
    problems.\r\n\r\nHave you tried writing the font from FontLab with a kern table
    (instead of, or in addition to the OTF kern <em>feature</em>)? In FontLab, go
    to Tools -> Options, bottom item is Kerning. It has a couple of choices, just
    because kerning caused problems in different programs. I'd start with just switching
    on 'Export kern table'."

  body: "No, rebooting alone does not clear your font caches. They may not be the
    culprit (Theunis' explanation may be at least as likely), but if they are, you
    haven't tried killing them.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, it would be the Adobe-specific
    cache files which could create different results across different versions of
    apps. You can kill them manually, or with a utility (the first one listed is even
    free):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jamapi.com/pr/index.html\r\nhttp://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/22795\r\nhttp://www.insidersoftware.com/SM_smash.php\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Menu \"Tools\", bottom entry sez \"Options\". Oh .. there are a few more
    than I remembered ...\r\nWell, the option to output kerning in a 'kern' table
    (rather than what you are <em>probably</em> using now, the kerning <em>OpenType
    feature</em>) is in the section \"Generating Opentype and Truetype\". Expand this
    item, and there it is at the bottom.\r\nSee p. 109 of the [[http://www.fontlab.com/fontlab-font-editors/fontlab-studio-8212-professional-font-editor/download-fontlab-studio.html|FontLab
    manual]] -- it even states,\r\n\r\n<cite>It is highly recommend to enable this
    option for TrueType / OpenType TT fonts. For OpenType PS fonts, the OpenType specification
    does not envision the \u201Ckern\u201D table to be part of OpenType PS fonts but
    it is possible to include the table nonetheless. Mac OS X and <strong>Adobe applications</strong>
    will read and use this table.</cite>\r\n\r\nwhich, coincidentally, might be a
    pre-CS3 remark, as you can read in the thread I referred to."

    this...\r\n\r\nThomas: thanks for the clarification, FontNuke has done the trick
    (many times...)\r\n\r\nTheunis: I think my missing options is a mac vs pc (preferences
    vs options) issue, sorry for the confusion\r\nI have read, and reread your advice
    and the previous post\r\nand read through the manual, \r\nwhile slowly making
    sense, i really do not yet have the understanding to really get to the bottom
    of the problem.\r\n\r\nI have tried a variety of OT export options\r\nand the
    font works in everything except CS2 (suitcase, text edit, everything...)\r\nI
    have cleared the cache with FontNuke many times\r\nI am perplexed at what I have
    done or continue to do wrong \r\nin desperation I am attaching screen shots of
    my options (preferences) below...\r\nthey are set how I think they should be,
    and to be honest, they have been basically like this the whole time\r\n\r\nI think
    I have the correct settings in the 'kerning' options, it has always been enabled
    actually... :(\r\n\r\none thing that i did think would help (but did not) was
    flipping from OS/2 table version 3 down to 2... no joy...\r\n\r\nanyone that can
