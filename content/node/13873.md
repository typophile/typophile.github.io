    is likely to be released at the end of this year but it's surely still a few months
    to go. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"

  body: "The FontLab folks don't work on such rigid schedules - they can make an estimate,
    but the odds are good that it will slip further. Leastways, based on past experience
    and my last chat with Adam on the topic.\r\n\r\nStill, it's hard to complain:
    they make fine software, and are really good about bug fixes and improvements
    based on user feedback.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
