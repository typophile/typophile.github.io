body: "Once upon a time, I came across a brilliant dingbat \"alphabet\"--all images
  of what I'd describe as creatures, critters, or monsters. \r\n\r\nExamples of vaguely
  similar monsters:\r\n<ul><li>Nibbler on <em>Futurama</em></li>\r\n<li>The vermicious
  knids from <em>Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</em>.</li>\r\n<li>The \"Infiltration\"
  monsters shown on this <a href=\"http://zim-dez.deviantart.com/art/Infiltration-115274291\">deviantART</a>
  page.</li></ul>\r\n \r\nMost notably I remember a cute one-eyed squid that I incorporated
  into my sigblock. But that was 10 years and 3 companies ago and any details beyond
  that are lost.\r\n\r\nI torqued myself buggy from 2-4 a.m. tonight trying to find
  this set. Every search tactic from monkey-fried click frenzy to advanced googling
  failed. But even so, I feel like the dingbats were charming and memorable enough
  that a pro or aficionado might be able to name the artist without too much sweat.\r\n\r\nMuch
  gratitude in advance for any efforts, successful or otherwise.\r\n\r\nSleepily yours,\r\n\r\nAnna"

    head and then reading these, I got some more keyword ideas and went searching
