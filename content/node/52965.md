body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nFor a project that I am working on in PHP/HTML/CSS, I have
  to string glyphs together as seperate images. So, a word like \"how\" would be presented
  as a string of images with one image representing each letter. \r\n\r\nAs each glyph
  image has been saved without padding, the kerning has to be figured out separately.
  \r\n\r\nMy question, therefore, is how do I identify the scalable kerning values
  of a font so that I can calculate a pixel kerning value based on the font's size.
  (Fortunately, the font being used doesn't have any kerning pairs, which simplifies
  things a lot.) \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, does anyone have any idea how to parse a font
  file in php?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\np.s. Sorry if I'm posting in the
  wrong board."

    the font has no kerning, there's nothing to identify. You could do your own kerning
    somehow. Or perhaps you really mean tracking, not kerning? (Kerning is adjusting
    spacing between individual letters based on their particular shapes, while tracking
    is adding or  subtracting a standard amount of space to all the letters.)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "No problem. Thanks for clarifying your question.\r\n\r\nWhat size range do
    you expect to be doing this with, and with what sorts of typefaces? Can you tell
    us more about the usage?\r\n\r\nAFAIK there is no standard for tracking based
    on type size. To the degree to which there is some consensus, I think it is that
    type on screen benefits from being looser than type in print at the same nominal
    size, particularly at text sizes.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is that different
    typefaces may be designed for use at different sizes and for screen or print,
    and spaced appropriately. So for example Verdana is designed and spaced to be
    used on screen at typical text sizes, and is spaced appropriately loosely as a
    result. There are few situations in which I can easily imagine needing to increase
    tracking for Verdana. But there are many situations in which I could imagine doing
    the same for Times, Helvetica, or Arial.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    the original font is. And I don't anything about parsing it in PHP, but I'm sure
    the more technically inclined here might.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the responses guys.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the use-case is very
    limited. I'm simply working with BellCential-StdAddress at size 12 and size 20,
    but the technique I am working on is something I would reuse in the future on
    other typefaces at other sizes. So, I'm trying to get things right first time
    so that I can apply the technique to any font at any size.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy thoughts
    were that, if the font's default tracking was included within the font's file,
    it could be extracted and applied accordingly. I would have thought that tracking
    would be based on some kind of ratio to another metric of the font and I could
    then calculate a pixel equivalent based on those 2 pieces of information and the
    font size.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help guys.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Actually, I think Kent is right, and you are probably actually wanting the
    sidebearings.  That is, in the original font, how much space exists between the
    outline of each letter and the left and right edges of the space it occupies.\r\n\r\nIgnoring
    monospaced (typewriter style) fonts for  a moment, this varies depending on the
    letter, based on underlying design characteristics of  the letter. This info *is*
    in the original font, but in most formats it is only accessible by actually analyzing
    the outline structure of every glyph.\r\n\r\nMost applications setting text don't
    normally have to keep track of this themselves, even when creating bitmaps. They
    define where they want the text to start. Then they plop down a glyph. OS APIs
    tell them how much total space each glyph takes (including sidebearings), which
    is essentially how far to move to allow for the next glyph....\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    could be easily gathered from the AFM file, no? Values are given for each character,
    which include among other things, the leftmost point and the advance width, right?
    Couldn't a bounding box for an image be derived from that information, converting
    to pixels and rounding?\r\n\r\n-- K."

    -1 ; WX 488 ; N checkmark ; B 22 -9 465 454 ;</code>\r\n\r\nWX is the total advance
    width, B is the bounding box, in  lower-left x, lower-left y, upper-right x, upper-right
    y order. So, advance to position leftx, draw (blit) the character, advance by
    WX. Properly scaled from 1000 units to the actual em-width in pixels, of course.\r\n\r\nYou
    cannot blit straightforward, because character boxes may overlap; however, that
    should not be beyond your capabilities :-)\r\n\r\nIf you can handle FreeType,
    this works in precisely the same way. Ask FT to draw a bitmap for a character,
    and it returns the very same values, together with a tightly cropped bitmap (you
    also have to position the bitmap vertically). You could ask the FT lib to re-generate
    the characters in your font to the same size, and store the values of interest.
    Then use the bitmaps you already have.\r\n\r\n[Add bonus points if you also use
    the <em>kerning</em> values for micro-adjustments!]"

    am reasonably sure I remember some Adobe engineers having the same need and not

    and the image replacement method I'm working on is quite different to the others

    handle kerning well, so one thing I would like to do is overcome that. Fortunately,
    with the font I'm working with, there are no kerning pairs, so it's not that important
    right now.\r\n\r\nMore important is calculating the default tracking value for
    a font at any given size because I am working with individual letters (rather
    than words, in which case PHP would handle the tracking itself).\r\n\r\nFor this
    reason, I was hoping that (a) the default tracking metric would be included within
    the font file and (b) I could figure out how to parse it via PHP.\r\n\r\nThanks

    of the main issues we faced on all of them.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the flashkit
