    logo...\r\n\r\nedit: looking into foundry form sans, thanks j...\r\nedit2: its
    deffo not gloriola standard medium italic, a the lowercase 'a' in that is not

    the font in the logo.\r\n\r\nThey have the logo featured in their portfolio:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.redpath.co.uk/trs1.html\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

    sans ''customised''.  As a graphic design student I was always taught altering
    typefaces was wrong, but ah well - I''ve done it too despite that. Thanks for
    the help guys!'

    for design groups to ask the designer who produced the typeface to alter it for
    a specific job. Your teacher was right.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: ^^oh right, I didn't realise foundries customize typefaces for specific clients,
    I guess with a big client like transport for scotland it probs wouldn't be a problem.  I
    think it's ok to modify typefaces occasionally, I try to avoid it, but sometimes
    a specific client or brief necessitates it if theres no typeface available, especially
    with academic project turnaround times...
