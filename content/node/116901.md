  \"FOUR\" - looks like a wood type\r\n2) the words \"a play by...\" - looks to be
  distressed\r\nI believe that the word \"sugar\" is Chesterfield by Alan Meeks\r\nThanks
  for your help in advance,\r\nRyan M"

  body: The word FOUR looks like a distressed version of Abadi MT (Cond Extra Bold)
    (It could have been woodtype but I just think it is an effect)

  body: "\"FOUR\" looks like <strong>[[http://www.dafont.com/axehandel.font?text=FOUR|AxeHandel]]</strong>
    by S. John Ross [2013, Free for personal use]\r\n(it has also the small \"noise\"
    dots)\r\n\r\nI also confirm \"sugars\" as Chesterfield\r\n"

  body: "Good find Bob. I couldn't find anything closer. To me _WWW.STRAYDOGTHEATRE.ORG_
    looks like the same font as _FOUR_ and differs from the images mainly in that
    it is thickened and roughened.  I believe that someone has used Ong Chong Wah's
    design for Abadi MT Condensed Extra Bold to make either a graphic or a derived
    font, which may turn up as a \"free\" font under another name.\r\nDon"
