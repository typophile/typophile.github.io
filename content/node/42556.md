    confusing but here are some recommendations, if I understand the question correctly.

    with square geometric shapes? ie the letters fit inside a square but aren't themselves
    *square*?\r\n\r\n-Rafe"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nSorry, yes, on a square grid and nothing like the full Futura
    font-- just the way the \"R\" has a straight line coming out of it as opposed
    to the \"R\" of helvetica which has a curve in it.\r\n\r\nThis is an example,
    but looking for something a little more well drawn but contemporary in feel.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCe[img:sites/default/files/old-images/square_3842.jpg]"

  body: "Try looking at Hebrew font families.\r\nI'll explain with this little list:\r\nHebrew
    lettering is square\r\nthe different languages in a type family must be cohesive\r\nTherefor,
    the roman letters in a Hebrew font family should be square.\r\n\r\nIf an Israeli
    typographer notices this, please validate or deny this point."
