<p>I think this is too black and white.</p>
<p>In “notan drawing” filling in with a marker defines notan’s edge. See: <a href="http://emptyeasel.com/2008/08/12/seeing-notan-how-to-make-stronger-compositions-using-lights-and-darks/">http://emptyeasel.com/2008/08/12/seeing-notan-how-to-make-stronger-compositions-using-lights-and-darks/</a>  Here notan drawing is a reductive operation that resolves a gradated scene or manifold into a light / dark composition.</p>
<p>In writing no such reduction is required. If the paper is white and the ink is black there is only the binary light / dark. In writing, notan’s edge is directly defined by the moving front.</p>
<p>In punch-cutting notan’s edge is defined by the subtractive process of cutting away.</p>
<p>Notan’s edge can be sharpened or recalibrated in digital technologies, but notan doesn’t have an edge until an area has been filled in or part of it cut away. Until an area is filled in the only thing that can be controlled is the trueness and action of the curve or line.</p>
<p>According to Kevin Larson, ganglion cells (that project from the rods and cones in the human eye to neural dendrites and axons in the visual cortex) look for edges. As far as I can find, they are also sensitive to surface polarity.</p>
<p>Does writing with a hand-held tool misinform?</p>
<p>Our internal representations of bounded maps of letters are role-unit based and feature-tolerant. That is, they are highly tolerant of variability in contrast styling and somewhat tolerant of role-architectural drift. These tolerances are enhanced by the cortical dynamics of font-tuning.</p>
<p>What we don’t know for sure, is if writing with the hand-held tool <em>optimally calibrates stress. </em></p>
<p>Here is a non-ideological but hypothetical context for assessing this.</p>
<p>My sense is that the sub-attentive parafoveal pre-processing that occurs in immersive reading responds to coarse-grained notanic composition, not fine-grained notanic equilibrium. It responds to this in deciding what words to skip and where to land when it makes it’s next saccade. It responds to salient areas of disturbed or undisturbed expressedness, or divergent aspect, or projection beyond the x-height range.</p>
<p>And my sense is that effortless, effective and automatic fovea-based processing relies on fine-grained rhythmic co-ordination of the blacks and whites. Fine-grained rhythmic co-ordination of the blacks and whites according to their relative saliencies and their allocation of weight in the cue-value domain optimizes the efficiency of cortical integrational routines within the visual cortex.</p>
<p>This imposes countervailing pressures on the sharpening and calibration or recalibration of notan’s edge.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just as the mechanics of the human eye react to such things as size, distance, color, difference ratio, and proximity to neighbors, I would think that the whole system reacts to and accommodates for whatever basis the form follows&ndash;if it be tool based or otherwise.   The human brain is an amazing tool.  It can &ldquo;read&rdquo; very well far, far, beyond optimum and trains itself to adapt to whatever it finds.  The magic is in the ability to adapt.  All life forms have survived by their ability to adapt.  Humans are the most adaptable creatures except for viruses.  I feel as though the search for the holy grail of &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; is not going to make reading much more possible or faster to comprehend than several of the typefaces already out there.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I designed a very strict 90 degree only bauhaus typeface.  At first, I thought it would be impossible to read.  I was amazed how quickly I adapted to the limited forms complete with picket fence effect and very minor differentiation.  The mind is a beautiful thing.  If that same mind is given free reign to design a typeface, I am sure that some very readable ones will come out.  The problem with awaiting the optimal research is that there is the danger of staying away from innovation for fear of missing the optimal.  Type designers are type designers and research scientists are research scientists.  We each have our role.  Waiting for one or the other to get there is of no use.  Scientists measure what is available to measure. If we stop trying things and stay with historic conventions, we limit what scientists will have to measure.  If a form is tool based or not is not the issue as much is making many different forms to see if there is a logic not yet discovered.</p>
<p>I would say, just keep working in whatever way your own mind leads you.  At some point,scientists may be more capable of making sense of it but giving them more options to test gives them more tools to work with.</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>

It just has a bearing on the probabilities in the distribution of skills and abilities among those who attempt the task.  Total failure is equally possible as total success. Ad nauseum blandness has the greatest chance of happening but the mediocre is soon forgotten and the complete failure is a great teacher for others.  The point is that there is no chance for progress without enough attempts.  Let there be failures and boring nothingness to be forgotten.

</blockquote>
<p>I think when you say &ldquo;hand-held tool&rdquo; that is too wide. There are a lot of different tools. For example the pointed Chinese brush works a lot differently from the pen. But interestingly they do the similar sorts of thing with thick and thin, even color, and so on. The thing is, the mind is guiding the tool, and trying to make it work for the eye.</p>
<p>If the question is whether the broad-pen drawn Carolingian miniscule optimally calibrates stress, I would say that evidence of history is that it handles stress very well for the eye, but not ideally. The Jenson, Griffo, Garamond line of type makers systematically changed the stress of the letters, and I think made them more readable. And publishers and readers certainly followed. For example, the top left to bottom right diagonals are lighter than they would be pen drawn. There&rsquo;s a lot of other subtle modulation that&rsquo;s different also, but the diagonal thing will do for a start.</p>

<p>Or if there is an optimally calibrated stress. We should consider the very real possibility that our reading ability is evolutionarily grounded in perceptual skills that by their nature are non-specialised and do not require particular input; indeed, they need to be able to handle a great variety of input with little performance variation. Presuming, reasonably I think, that reading is a free rider on shape recognition abilities that evolved in the context of negotiating the natural world, why should we think that it requires optimisation of particular kinds of shapes, when what we&rsquo;re confronted with in nature is phenomenal diversity.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>[editorial comment: cross-posted with Bill&rsquo;s comment just above.]</p>
<p>John, the term feature-tolerant accounts for the performance variation part of what you have to say. I adapted the term from a 2011 paper by Andreas M. Rauschecker, Reno F. Bowen, Lee M. Perry, Alison M. Kevan, Robert F. Dougherty, and Brian A. Wandell called “Visual Feature-Tolerance in the Reading Network” [Neuron 71, 941–953 / available online]. Another term that’s used is invariant recognition.</p>
<p>One of the areas of current debate is to what extent reading is a free-rider on recognition abilities “evolved in the context of negotiating the natural world.” The debate centers around the question of specialization for words in the ventral occipital-temporal circuitry, sometimes referred to as the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA). Laurent Cohen and Stanislas Dehaene (author of Reading in the Brian) are prominent names on one side: Cathy Price and Joseph Devlin on the other.</p>
<p>I tried to place the <em>defining notan’s edge</em> question into a more inclusive framework that the one Hrant uses, but this probably needs to be further developed to become clear.</p>
<p>The <em>stress-factor</em> probably has more to do with ‘perceptual psychophysical costs’, the term that came up around the discussion of the Luckiesh / Tinker divide.</p>
<p>Optimal is probably the wrong word to use when talking about contrast styling. I think there is no visual-circuitry related reason why the allocation of stress in western scripts typical of at least the best broad-pen variants of writing exacts undue perceptual psychophysical costs. I think this is where the debate about type of stress can most profitably touch done.</p>
<p>In my mind, I’ve begun to relate the notan part of these discussions to Luckiesh and Moss’s blink rate results in assessing relative boldness, a result that Dwiggins embraced. Is there a better notanic balance or distribution in the somewhat bolder range than the typical regular weight? Does this have to do with the better visability of both the black and white? and how does this relate to perceptual psychophysical costs? Perceptual pschophysical costs have to do, as far as I can see, with the efficiency of corticl integrational processing routines inside the visual cortex.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We know we can compromise speed and comfort of decoding letters by too tight or irregular spacing, for example. There is no question we can still decode with too tight spacing. The question is, how fast we can do it, and at what psycho-physical cost. The slow down in reading speed is well documented with markedly sub-optimal type. So is fatigue or discomfort in reading, if Luckiesh&rsquo;s work with blink rate is sound. So I think there is reason to believe, as Dwiggins and Frutiger have said in the past, there there is some kind of ideal. And if Luckiesh is right, it does involve weight. He didn&rsquo;t test modulation of stroke, which Dwiggins thought an important question, or evenness of color, which I would like to see tested.</p>
<p>I would concede that it&rsquo;s not a matter of shape as such, as different scripts have greatly different shapes. But I do think such issues as spacing, evenness of color, and even modulation of stroke may make a difference. I think there is no doubt that even an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; for text type (lengthy passages at 8-12 point printed) will have a range, not a pinpoint, and allow for expressive and aesthetic variation. But I do think there is reason to suspect that such an ideal range exists. The recent article by Legge and Bigelow put a fluent reading range from 4-40 points, but I think a lot more can be done to narrow that in a number of ways.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As far as relative boldness, Peter, my hypothesis is that what is working here is the interplay of two things: the figure/ground distinction, and visibility. To &ldquo;read&rdquo; the figure it need to be clearly differentiated from the ground. So the ground need to have clearly more of its color than the figure. This would argue that lighter strokes would be better. Bolder strokes are, however, more visible. Yet they may crowd out &ldquo;ground&rdquo;, so that the figure/ground relationships is upset. So somewhere between very bold and very light is best. Frutiger thought it was, in the x-height area, having the black strokes about 30% of the white space.</p>
<p>As far as modulation, one thing I can think of is that keeping the joins of relatively even color with the strokes requires thinning of one or the other of the strokes, or both. If I got it right, Chinese also follows this rule, as well as Hebrew. I don&rsquo;t know about other scripts. Broad pen does some of this automatically, which is an advantage. So that would explain why modulation is better.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris, to me what makes it easy recognize as the &ldquo;ground&rdquo; is that there is more of it, and it&rsquo;s an even color. So when the ground is less than 50% locally, there is more possibility of the eye taking it for figure. That&rsquo;s why I think that it&rsquo;s reasonable that less than very bold weights are less taxing to read in extended text. But how much isn&rsquo;t clear, at least to me. The countervailing force is the need for visibility. According to Luckiesh bolder is more visible.</p>
<p>Hrant, you are right to note leading. That&rsquo;s one of the indications that there&rsquo;s a range as far as weight, not one ideal. There&rsquo;s a very interesting comparison in Mitchell &amp; Wightman&rsquo;s Book Typography. There they show that a light type, Spectrum, works well with less leading, but a dark type, Quadraat, works better with more leading. So the interlinear space does affect what the eye takes as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; or comfortable text weight. Of course, extenders are another factor affecting what works best as far as leading. So when designing a text type, what leading it can take well or not take is a consideration, and as both the darkness and the extenders will affect it&hellip;</p>

Both the black and the white shapes inside the word, that is both the stroke-units and the counters, are information for vision in a real and active way. Both contribute actively to visual word-form resolution.</p>
<p>Designing letters so that the entire word can pop out as if it were an internally cohesive figure against a ground is to me part of the challenge facing type designers. Designing the whites recognizes that both the stroke-units and the counters, are information for vision in a real and active way.</p>
<p>I think there is a hierarchy of figure / ground relationships in text, one centered on the stroke, another on the letter, a third on the word, another on the line, a fifth centered on the column, a fourth centered on the page. All require attention. The word-related one I think is central.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Peter, I think that the figure and the ground operate differently as far a psychological processing. One of the most basic perceptual functions is recognizing a &ldquo;object.&rdquo; That involved identifying edges, as you say, but also putting these together to form an object, or in this case letter, that is distinctive from its background. The distinction between figure and ground is thus critical for recognition.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a clear theory of how white is handled, but I am pretty sure it must be different. My feeling is that handling the whites well for text is mainly a matter of getting the black to be detected easily. There evenness of color and consistency of form are important. I have the feeling that only in the case of issues as whether a form is closed or open does white play a direct role in character recognition.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris, I think they may function differently in reading, so that to understand brain processing in reading, the distinction my be important. For example, it may be that a slight variation in width of the black stems, or positive, has a bigger impact on recognition or ease of reading than a slight variation in negative, such as space between letters.</p>
<p>What exactly an understanding of the differences will tell us I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it would turn up something of interest to designers.</p>
<p>For example, what makes the white seem more vivid in some counters of bold letters? Is it figure/ground ambiguity, or something else? And what does that tell us about when this is a good or bad thing?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, to my mind reading involves edge detection as well as detection of surface polarity, in this case black and white. As well, to my mind, neither the visual cortex nor any other part of the brain <em>puts these edged shapes together</em> to form an object. They are already together. To my way of seeing it, all the visual system has to do is resolve, by eye-fixations inside a word, what stroke-units are connected to what other stroke units and counter units (local combination detection), and how the stroke-units in their combinations are distributed across the figure or word-object as a whole.</p>
<p>The problem as I see it is not just to get the black and / or white to be detected easily, but to have the entire word be seen and processed as one cohesive, weight, contrast and spatial frequency co-ordinated thing. Unless they are meaningful markers, eveness of colour and inconsistency of formal logic created a signal / versus noise confound for the visual cortex, which it has to neutralize. They present roadblocks to efficient processing in the visual cortex.</p>

more than contrast, which is the meat-and-potatoes of information.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Peter, I didn&rsquo;t mean to imply that letter recognition has to precede word recognition. I agree with you that aspects of different letters being identified, and response to the whole pattern of these across the word, may well be what is going on. But even in identifying the aspects, I suspect that the black has priority. For example, the brain is looking for joins, or branches in the black. I thing there is putting together the glyph or word in the way that an object is put together.</p>
<p>There may be differences from object recognition because you are dealing with decoding to reach meaning, as in listening to language, but still I see a priority on the structure of the blacks. For example, I don&rsquo;t think that the shape of whites between has the same <em>salience</em> or impact as the shape of blacks in glyphs. And I think this could be shown, as I suggested to Chris, by a greater sensitivity to blacks than whites, except for identifying open and closed structures.</p>
<p>For example, if you show me a word in a new typeface, then hide it, I and other type designers might be able to reproduce the distinctive features of the letters fairly quickly and well. But if you ask us to reproduce the shapes of whites between the letters, without drawing the glyphs, I think the result would be much slower, and worse.</p>

<p>I would ascribe salience to features, such as <em>expressedness</em> which can be circular or n shaped, disturbed as in the e and s, or undesturbed as in the o and the dpqb group. Other examples of features are <em>extension</em> beyond the x-height range; or <em>aspect</em>, which is oblique in the x; or </em>closure</em> and the lack of it.

<p>Not all the white are quantizable into fully realized role units. Closed counters seem to be (o, bpqd); those in the m and n and u as well. But some open counters like in the lower part of the a and the s are perhaps only quantizable into what might be called demi role-units. Between-letter whites aren&rsquo;t quantizable into role units at all. Probably they are used as word-integral reference points for compiling distributional statistics.</p>

<p>Why would the eye expect any such thing?
The eye would expect periodicity (partial) because it is a feature of our of good text fonts, as confirmed by Fourier analysis of text blocks. (And even built into our scripts.) And the periodicity helps the brain where to look for salient letter features that will help identify the word.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And why would any information be ignored?
The brain has to pick out of the visual field the salient information. I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;ignore&rdquo; is exactly the right word, but &ldquo;winnowing,&quot;—which is essential to isolate and decode text in the visual field. What I&rsquo;m saying is that the winnowing of much of the white space is different from the black. The spacing around the letters and lines helps us set the grid, but the shapes of the white around words and between lines is not, I suspect, generally registered as <em>shapes.</em></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>All this talk of white versus black makes no sense when you
take into account that there&rsquo;s nothing in between, so the two
are in fact one thing: notan. I can&rsquo;t imagine how one could
focus on one aspect or another of the black or the white and
design with that in mind without adversely affecting the other.
And that&rsquo;s why we should look at the border and not the bodies.</p>

<p>Now <em>that</em> sounds like the high priests who confronted Galileo&hellip;
And here&rsquo;s an opportune Galileo quote: &ldquo;In questions of science, the
authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single
individual.&rdquo; My whole point is that we don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s good.
And I feel safe in saying that this stuff isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Fourier images are a mathematically objective indication of periodicity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well all that says is that those fonts are [somewhat] periodic!
If you could couple that to data -good data, not the sort of thing
we&rsquo;ve seen so far- showing that the more periodic a font the greater
its readability then you have a case.</p>
<p>The problem with data is that the more sophisticated it is,
the harder it is to interpret, and the more room is left for
subjective interpretation&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need both the underlying meter, and the departure

</blockquote>
<p>This is post-rationalization.</p>
<p>A song that deviated from a rhythm at almost every note is not something
most people want to listen to! That&rsquo;s because music appreciation is a
conscious activity. But a text font is like the sounds of the jungle. If there&rsquo;s
any rhythm, it&rsquo;s like chaos theory, and beyond our conscious appreciation.
Which means we can&rsquo;t design for that, and we must forgo rhythm.</p>
<p>So to me it&rsquo;s not that we need some illusion to depart from, it&rsquo;s that we
need to find a new destination. The big mountain range that rises much
higher than our plateau, with the big body of water in between&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Peter, I think in conceding that whites between letters are not &ldquo;quantized on a role unit level,&rdquo; you are conceding that whites and blacks are not treated the same, which is my point. [For those not familiar with Peter&rsquo;s terminology: role unit = salient sub-letter feature, such as a branch, an open counter, etc.]</p>
<p>The greater salience of the blacks compared to whites between letters and above and below the line is my point. The eye and brain processing starts with a bunch of visual information, and has to winnow it down to identify the code, and decode it. So it starts with both black and white, but the mechanism is after features of the black. That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t consciously notice or remember the shape between the c and a in ca, but we do remember the c and a.</p>
<p>Hrant, by good text font, I simply meant those fonts widely recognized as good, and widely used in extended text, such as Garamond, Times New Roman, etc.</p>
<p>Here, thanks to Peter, is a strip of a Fourier image done on a text block of Minion:
<img src="/images/old-images/minion_fourier_3767.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Objectively, there is a lot of regular periodicity, indicated by the evenly spaced white bands—indicating a concentration of black stems, as I remember. But there is also a significant amount of departure from strictly regular periodicity. Here there is room for interpretation. My interpretation is that letters define enough regularity to give the eye a grid to read off of, but that the letters depart from it this way and that, which is what we &ldquo;read&rdquo;. We need both the underlying meter, and the departure from it, like meter vs rhythm in a song.</p>
<p>You can have an alternative theory of why Fourier transforms of text look the way they do. But if you want to deny significant regular periodicity, I think you have gone into the land of loony denial.</p>
<p>As to the m in Williams Caslon Text, yes I did make the counters slightly narrower than the n and thinned the middle vertical slightly, as is a common trick. I think it saves a little space and differentiates the m a little better. But I didn&rsquo;t make it much narrower than two superimposed n&rsquo;s, which is also common in many fonts. That&rsquo;s because I felt the departure from regularity hit the right balance of being close to the underlying meter (which is around half the width of the n), while departing slightly from it. It&rsquo;s probably what Caslon did also, but right now I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>

<p>Hrant, you seem to not understand the way rhythm works in music, which is maybe the source of your objection to the metaphor in type. There are two different things going in music. One is the underlying beat, which is normally extremely even, in a single meter—the same number of beats to each measure. Played against the underlying beat is the rhythm of the melodic line, which can vary a lot from the beat. In syncopated music, which is common for dance music, the rhythm of the melodic line constantly plays with going on and off the beat. And normally in dance music you have a steady beat of the drum, and so you can clearly hear both the rhythm of the melodic line and the beat, playing against one another.</p>
<p>What I am suggesting is that the fairly regular bars of the verticals are analogous to the beat in music, and the departures from it like the rhythm that plays against the underlying beat.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, going back a few steps in this thread, I make a distinction between features and role units. At TypeCon / Atlanta I said:
the visual system
(1) breaks stimulus words down into oriented lines and curves, to the point where
(2) responsiveness to aspect, closure and expressedness accumulates and
(3) resolution or ‘quantization’ into role-units occurs.</p>
<p>#1 needs refinement in relation to what I said in my opening post about ganglion cells looking for edges and registering surface polarity.</p>
<p>#2 relates to features and is the focus of feature analytic processing. This is what Frank Smith based his ideas about perceptual processing in reading on. Quantization into role-units is one of the things that happens in feature analytic processing. Closure is a feature, bowls and counters are role-units. So instead of saying the mechanism is after features of the black, I would say the mechanism uses features of the black / white composite to isolate role-units, many of which are black, some of which are white. It doesn&rsquo;t only isolate role units, it reads the black and white relationally in parallel*.</p>
<p>*I&rsquo;m working on the idea that this is the essence of what Hrant means when he says we read notan. We read the black and white relationally in parallel. Optimizing relational processing with a focus on the black and white composition is it seems to me one of the key things Hrant is after.</p>
<p>Apparently the neurophysics of the visual cortex has an on-center / off surround structure. Without going into all the details — some of which I haven&rsquo;t been able to assimilate fully — I think it can be said that optimal relational processing across the word using both blacks and whites occurs when the on-center / off-surround routines in the two polarity domains intermesh.</p>
<p>I think the intermesh issue underlines the relevance of Hrant&rsquo;s quest. It is one of the things the visual cortex needs for efficient processing of words.</p>

<p>Yes but they&rsquo;re both grids. I hope you&rsquo;re not saying we

that immersive reading is not conscious (while music is).
Jungle sounds don&rsquo;t have beats or rhythms or anything

<p>When I try to define the terms &ldquo;painting&rdquo; and &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; it&rsquo;s not
an ideological move - it&rsquo;s just to promote clear communication.
Also, any concept is necessarily absolute; however any <em>application</em>
of any concept is never absolute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In writing no such reduction is required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I would say is that in writing (what I call &ldquo;painting&rdquo;, to
remove any ambiguity, since &ldquo;writing&rdquo; might imply the formation of
the skeletons - so in a way, ductus) no such <em>objective</em> is <em>achievable</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>notan doesn’t have an edge until an area
has been filled in or part of it cut away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, notan is defined as soon as the edge is marked.
It however does not exist until the black/white is marked.
Type designers do the former. If they do (or even factor in)
the latter first (painting) they cannot achieve the former.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our internal representations of bounded maps of letters are role-unit
based and feature-tolerant. That is, they are highly tolerant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The human body is highly tolerant of grapefruit. And it tastes great.
But if you have too much you may lose a member or get breast cancer.

Information is information. If information in the parafovea

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m with Bill on figure bias, which I think is part and parcel of recognising <em>things</em> as distinct from the space around or through them. The fact that text typically involves a radically simplified figure/ground relationship, of a kind that we seldom encounter in nature except when a bird is silhouetted against a bright sky, doesn&rsquo;t suggest to me a variant mechanism: we still bias the figure, the thing to be recognised, over the ground, the background against which the thing stands. This is also one of the reasons why I remain suspicious of notions of word recognition distinct from letter recognition, because I think &lsquo;word&rsquo; is a conceptually fuzzier concept than letter, such that most people asked to describe a letter will describe its figure form, i.e. conceptualise a letter as a thing; whereas, in this discussion, a word is put forward as a gestalt of figure and ground, but also as a collection of letter things in a particular periodic relationship.</p>
<p>[Thanks, by the way, Bill, for introducing the notion of periodicity, which provides the opportunity to talk about regularised and flexible spatial relationships without using the more contentious term &lsquo;rhythm&rsquo;.]</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>[hrant] <em>not on ideological move</em></p>
<p>I made my “a non-ideological but hypothetical context” comment in the context of addressing the issue of whether or not writing with a hand-held tool informs or misinforms. In the ductus thread you wrote: “I&rsquo;d also substitute &ldquo;misinform&rdquo; for &ldquo;inform&rdquo; — that is an ideological issue.</p>
<p>About your other comments: defining notan’s edge and defining notan are different but related things. The two go hand in hand. I’ll stick for now with what I said about defining notan’s edge. If optimal notan is posed as an objective is to be achieved we have to have a handle on what it is in the domain of reading writing. I tried to do this with my intermeshing on-center / off-surround comments above.</p>
<p>The only way to gauge this intermeshing ‘on the ground’ in design is, as far as I can see, by optically assessing phase alignment in the blacks and optically assessing the rhythmic cohesion of the whites, as well as optically assessing if one pole drowns out the other, that is if rhythmic cohesion in the whites has come at the expense of phase alignment in the blacks and vice versa. Optimizing notan ‘on the ground’ is a highly iterative process involving working at notan’s edge.</p>
<p>An other way to gauge how well the black versus white on-center / off-surround routines intermesh is, I suspect by using fast fourier transforms, though I’m not sure just yet exactly how.</p>
<p>Your commented on my feature-tolerant comment seems designed to suggest it’s not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The point of my mentioning this was not to encourage satisfaction with what we’ve achieved but to contextualize over-reaching statements about dark ages and inverse relationships between making progress and encouraging awareness of ductal arithmetic. A criterion level of readability is fairly easy to achieve. Pelli’s work suggests there is a wide plateau. Legge and Bigelow show there is an ample fluent range. The importance of Luckiesh and Moss is that they were able to push beyond this. Their work shows there are peaks and valleys on the plateau.</p>
<p>So we are not in the dark ages but there is more to do.</p>
<p>About your “1/3 of text is foveated” comment. Here I think you are counting letters, not words. If I remember correctly you  use a low-end estimate about how many letters can sit in the fovea at one time at a decent viewing range, and a high-end estimate of how many letter spaces a typical saccade jumps over. A more useful concept for schematizing how much info can be picked up during a single fixation might be the Pelli idea of the uncrowded span.</p>
<p>I’m still searching for a good term to describe what kind of gathering occurs in  parafoveal preview. The closest I can find to something I think works is the notion of “accurate ensemble statistics,” [Patrick Cavanagh] or “summary statistics” [Benjamin Balas], though neither feel quite right.</p>

My idea is that in reading, the response bias is indeed to the figure, which is the word. As a figure, the word has a composite structure. The letter has this too*. But in the word the composite structure is compounded. I think this is a more productive approach when thinking through the processing mechanisms occurring in the visual cortex.</p>
<p>*Noordzij begins <em>The Stroke</em> by saying that a letter is two shapes, one light, one dark. Because the white is a shape it becomes figural. Noordzij uses this to talk about the history of writing, and in his hands it becomes more than a design conceit. To treat some instance of “word-blindness” Noordzij ran across in in school, he provided exercises that prompted the visual cortex to imprint on the white shapes.</p>
<p>Noordzij contends that educators focus on the black. My extension of this is that cognitive and perceptual scientists make this mistake too.</p>
<p>In this context Hrant is more Noordzijian than you.</p>

I doubt introduces an unreasonable skew). I define the fovea as the
central 3-4 letter area where individual letters can be identified
after many seconds of conscious evaluation, with anything beyond the
fovea dropping quickly in acuity and being useless for <em>small things
like letters</em>*; if anything this is generous. As for the length of saccades,
they can easily go over 10, sometimes to around 15. So I have to think
1/3 is conservative, and in fact anything less than 1/1 means the parafovea
is reading boumas. And really, if it&rsquo;s good enough to determine the next
point of fixation, why would it be shy about how it got that determination?</p>
<ul>
<li>But still OK for clusters of letters; and the more
distinctive and frequent a cluster the deeper into
the parafovea it can be recognized. I mean really,
is that elegant or what?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not that Pelli&rsquo;s research is pointless, but I honestly don&rsquo;t
need to grasp it simply to draw the basic conclusion above.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The flaws in Hrant’s <em>parafoveal reading of boumas</em> logic.</p>
<p>Estimates of acuity and saccade distance vary. The wikipedia on eye movement in language reading says that around the fixation point only 4 to 5 letters are seen with 100 percent acuity. The drop-off is quite rapid. The distance the eye moves in each saccade is between 1 and 20 characters with the average being 7 to 9 characters. A new saccade places 2 to 3 of the 7 to 9 characters crossed in a saccade into foveal vision during the new fixation. This means that all in all, on average, 4 to 5 of 7 to 9 characters have become available to foveal vision after a single saccade. 1 and 20 character saccades are highly unusual I would think.</p>
<p>So I think it’s wrong to suggest that only 1/3 of text is foveated.</p>
<p>The conclusion Hrant appears to want to draw from this calculation is that the parafovea is or can be reading boumas at a rate of 2 out of every 3 words. The conclusion that should be made, is that with short words 2 out of every 3 words are available to parafoveal vision with each fixation, but since the resolution capabilities of parafoveal vision don’t allow genuine visual word-form resolution, at least one of those two must be brought into foveal vision in a subsequent fixation. Typically only short, frequent connective tissue words, like <em>the</em> and <em>in</em> and <em>on</em> are skipped.</p>
<p>Pelli has characterized what paravoveal vsion delivers as jumbled percepts. What the coarse-coding capabilities do allow seems to be what I might want to call jumble statistics. Jumble statistics would than account for what is commonly referred to as the parafoveal preview benefit. Jumble statistics, which probably can capture where salient features like areas of disturbed or undisturbed expressedness lie, for instance, can undoubtedly affect “saccade planning.”</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s gonna have to be, since that didn&rsquo;t work at all&hellip;  :-)</p>
<p>A text face designer interested in marking a non-trivial increase in
reading performance isn&rsquo;t concerned with how people <em>usually</em> read;
he&rsquo;s concerned with how they <em>might</em> read under the right conditions.
So the fact that most saccades are short means virtually nothing;
the significant thing is that they <em>can</em> be very long without adversely
affecting comprehension. The only way to explain this that I can think
of is that boumas <em>can</em> be picked up in the parafovea, and probably at
a rate greater than in the fovea. And when you say &ldquo;the resolution
capabilities of parafoveal vision don&rsquo;t allow genuine visual word-
form resolution&rdquo;, I would say:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don&rsquo;t know that.</li>
<li>How do you explain the existence of very long saccades?</li>
<li>How do you explain regressions?
Concerning the last: to me regressions happen when the guesswork
(something the brain is great at) based on the blurry parafovea is
simply wrong; the fovea doesn&rsquo;t make mistakes like that. And the
more experience the &ldquo;firmware&rdquo; acquires the better a balance it can
strike between speed and regressions; a total absence of regressions
is actually a bad thing - it means it&rsquo;s not trying hard enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for foveal acuity, I guess the number range I&rsquo;m working with is fine.</p>
<p>As for Pelli, all I can say is that it seems he&rsquo;s been measuring low-
performance reading (like Larson, and pretty much everybody else).
I define that as reading by people who are not motivated to read fast
or whose &ldquo;firmware&rdquo; does not yet have the experience to leverage the
parafovea; it is known for example that people&rsquo;s reading improves
well into middle age and beyond. And the little bouma-hunting fairies
know better than to come out for casual reading tasks.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you don&rsquo;t think the parafovea is active in actual reading
of boumas, your case for boumas is&hellip; poof! As Larson has convinced
me at least, the fovea does not need more than individual letters.</p>

<p>Maybe by mapping a language and diverging the boumas of
word pairs* that are close; for example in the &ldquo;quest&rdquo;/&ldquo;guest&rdquo;

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, your diverging boumas idea is perhaps worth pursuing. Diverging boumas, if you will, is one of the forces driving script evolution. The other pole is optimizing phase alignment and rhythmic cohesion to get consolidation of the word image. The latter reaches a high point in terxtura, but at the cost of divergent boumas. I believe this dynamic is described somewhere in Noordzij&rsquo;s writing.</p>
<p>Earlier you said: “If information in the parafovea is used to decide what word a bouma is (and that&rsquo;s clearly happening because at the top end only 1/3 of text is foveated)
then that&rsquo;s reading.”</p>
<p>I took this to be your description of how we <em>actually</em> read. I tried to show that your facts are skewed and your conclusions misleading, because they fail to take into account well-documented and widely accepted constraints on parafoveal vision.</p>
<p>Now you say: “A text face designer interested in marking a non-trivial increase in reading performance isn&rsquo;t concerned with how people <em>usually</em> read; he&rsquo;s concerned with how they <em>might</em> read under the right conditions.” I think your ideas about how people <em>might</em> read don&rsquo;t recognize hard-wired perceptual psychophysical constraints, or that upper limit saccades are, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken typically followed by regressions, that is, they&rsquo;ve gone too far. The thread of sense has become interrupted.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I do think, as hinted at above that the parafoveal preview benefit can be enhanced by strategic moves in some of the directions you describe.</p>
<p>I think that the time required for robust sense-following and accurate meaning construction are the real constraints on speed, not improperly leveraging the parafovea. The actual foveal uptake of information takes much less time than 1/4 of a second.</p>

<p>Not really, because if you give someone a black pen and a black piece of paper and ask them to write something, they&rsquo;ll still write the same letter shapes that they would if writing on white paper. We know what the figure shapes of letters are independent of our perception of the ground, and hence I find it reasonable to consider that we bias those figure shapes just as we bias the figure shapes of deer against a backdrop of trees. Indeed, given the great variety of weight and proportion in letters that we recognise as the same figure forms, necessarily independent of the shapes and sizes of the internal and intervening ground, it seems to me that the <em>structure</em> of the figure form is not only biased but the essential component, more than the area or edge of either black or white. We can&rsquo;t claim that a super heavy and a hairline letter &lsquo;a&rsquo; are recognised on any basis but their shared figural structure, since the black is otherwise so dissimilar and the white even more so.</p>

up text in the largest chunks possible.</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that is proven, and it isn&rsquo;t necessarily a good intuition either. Efficiency does not always reside in eating up the largest chunk possible, as you&rsquo;ll discover if you try to eat a piece of cake that way while your older sister nibbles at hers and finishes first (thereby winning the coveted last slice on the plate). The key notion for efficiency seems to me whatever constitutes &lsquo;bite size&rsquo; in reading, i.e. what is the optimal size of the perceptual unit for speed, accuracy and endurance (comfort over time)? Two things that seem obvious to me are that a) letters have a built-in advantage over sub-letter and super-letter elements as perceptual units in that they are self-contained visually and often linguistically (more so in many languages than in English), and b) the optimal perceptual unit varies as we read, most obviously relative to word length and familiarity. So I have no difficulty accepting that some of the time the optimal perceptual unit is something larger than a single letter, especially in the case of short and common words, whether that is conceived as a bouma or a particular role architecture or a particular gridded arrangement. But I don&rsquo;t think it is likely, let alone proven, that the brain is always trying to consume the biggest chunks of text possible. On the contrary, the process of becoming a good reader must involve the brain learning from experience how much of a text to bite off; which is why experienced readers make fewer regressions than inexperienced ones and do better in accuracy tests than so-called speed readers, who bite off more than they can chew.</p>

<p>John, think in perceptual processing terms. To facilitate this I suggest it is important to distinguish between units of perception and units of processing, tokenizable parts of composite structures, and featural primitives.</p>
<p>Words have a built-in advantage over letters as perceptual units in that they are space-delimited and internally cohesive bounded maps of blacks and whites. To get to letters a preliminary segmentation (tokenization) must occur within this unit that designer try their darndest to make internally cohesive, that is, to make into a single unit, a perceptual unit.* Letters are the tokenizable parts of composite structures and the composite structures have gestalt integrity.</p>
<p>Every perceptual scientist I know begins with feature detection or feature analytic processing. To me features (in the alphabetic domain) are things like expressedness and closure. In my scheme the units of processing in glyph-like structures are role-units. Most psychologist collapse the two (features and role-units).</p>
<p>If, at the role-unit level, blacks are in phase and whites rhythmically coordinated, the segmentation is psycho-physically discourged or inhibited. This is why I think a single-tiered cross-letter gathering of role-units (protoypical <em>structures</em> — white and black — not literal <em>shapes</em>) with attention to their local combination characteristics and global distribution across word-integral between-letter reference points is the best way to address the recognitional problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should designers stop trying to do this? Don&rsquo;t designers try to acheive gestalt cohesion by making letters <em>less</em> self-contained and more open to eachother?</li>

<p>I wish. As far as I&rsquo;ve seen (and it does make sense) divergence is only
implemented at the level of individual symbols, and that only in extreme
cases (like &ldquo;1&rdquo; vs &ldquo;7&rdquo; where the latter is given a middle bar). This is not
surprising because layman consciousness cannot grasp immersive reading;
it only grasps legibility, and that only in an informal, reactionary way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>well-documented and widely accepted constraints on parafoveal vision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a rule simpler data is more reliable. I think these &ldquo;constraints&rdquo;
might be the result of poor testing. How do you explain the simpler,
more reliable data showing that saccades can far exceed letterwise
decipherment resolution?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>upper limit saccades are, if I&rsquo;m not
mistaken typically followed by regressions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen that.
If you show me that <em>all</em> saccades that exceed the
fovea&rsquo;s span (4-5 letters) result in a regression
(or faulty comprehension) then I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the parafoveal preview benefit can be enhanced</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it can be enhanced to the point of picking out boumas, that
means the capability is there&hellip; Why this parafoveaphobia?  :-)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The actual foveal uptake of information
takes much less time than 1/4 of a second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that reinforces my view!
I posit that the remainder of the effort is going into reading the parafovea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you give someone a black pen and a black piece of paper
and ask them to write something, they&rsquo;ll still write the same
letter shapes that they would if writing on white paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be serious.
Try writing with your eyes closed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can&rsquo;t claim that a super heavy and a hairline letter &lsquo;a&rsquo; are
recognised on any basis but their shared figural structure, since
the black is otherwise so dissimilar and the white even more so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But they&rsquo;re <em>not</em> dissimilar, in the ways that count.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key notion for efficiency seems to me
whatever constitutes &lsquo;bite size&rsquo; in reading</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I agree.
But it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for that to be letters, because clusters
of them occur in high frequencies* and furthermore are easier
to pick out in the blurry parafovea.</p>
<ul>
<li>And for example &ldquo;th&rdquo; is much more frequent than &ldquo;z&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I&rsquo;d ask you to consider is this: if short and common words are
picked up as wholes, why not increasingly long and decreasingly
common as a reader&rsquo;s experience increases? Language after all is
incredibly redundant - English is around 50%. So the more you
read the more you can be sufficiently sure that blurry cluster in
the parafovea is what you think it is and take the leap, literally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>experienced readers make fewer regressions than inexperienced ones</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is only true when the reader isn&rsquo;t being challenged, either
in terms of time pressure or difficulty of the material. My feeling
is that the proportion of regressions is maintained at the top end;
it&rsquo;s the length of saccades that increases with experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t designers try to acheive gestalt cohesion by making
letters less self-contained and more open to each other?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not enough. And painting the letters necessarily
impedes that, even if one believes in the White.</p>

<p>I think that, to make bold statements about grasping immersive reading you need also to immerse yourself in the science. My view goes against the conventional understanding of reading,  but developed and is developing in constant conversation with a wealth of literature from various subdomains and in the context of conflicting perspectives within the literature. My apriori going in were and are shaped by paying close attention to the obsessions and attunements of masters of the craft of type-design and typography, as well as to initiatives like yours and Bloemsma&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>As I said in Thessaloniki years ago, it&rsquo;s an ever-expanding sea to drink and a conflicting maze of wandering paths, but it can be wonderfully productive.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, is your idea that saccades are made when the reading system <em>already has</em> an idea about or knows what the n+1 or n+2 word is (where n is the fixated word)? The purpose of a fixation is then 1) to verify or falsify, and 2) to bring more words into parafoveal view?</p>
<p>I can understand the appeal of this, but I doubt it’s how immersive reading actually works.</p>
<p>This also helps me understand your line of questioning, the logic behind your snippet retorts, and that you might think all my foveal “rapid automatic visual word-form resolution” stuff is grossly inflated and largely beside the point, <em>and</em> that the parallel letter recognition view is right in the domain of foveal vision.</p>
<p>My understanding is that saccades are made when a foveally-based visual word-form resolution event has occurred, and because we <em>don’t</em> know from parafoveal preview what the n+1 or n+2 word is. The reason why some words are skipped and why the next saccade will go to the n+2 word instead is because of the anticipatory structure of sense-following which seems to be oriented to bringing substance words into view.</p>
<p>A basic principle for me is that, though the <em>unit of perception</em> is typically the word, rapid automatic visual word-form resolution requires robust perceptual discrimination affordance at least to the level of role-units  / letter parts / features. I take this to be confirmed beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt by Pelli’s work. Luckiesh expresses this by laying emphasis on the visibility or clear seeing of the critical details as a first reqirement for ease of reading.</p>

<a href="http://themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html">http://themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html</a>
(I don&rsquo;t know why that segment is suddenly going wrong font&hellip;)</p>
<p>Basically I think the fovea and parafovea are each used for what
they&rsquo;re good at: the former for its acuity, the latter for its range.</p>
<p>So we fixate on something, and simultaneously read what are in effect
single-letter (but see below) boumas in the fovea and multi-letter
boumas in the parafovea (in the direction of reading only). The depth
to which we can read in the parafovea depends on how high-frequency
and distinctive the given boumas are. The location of the next fixation
is simply where our confidence (which gets built up over time with
experience, and also depends on the difficulty of the material) has
run out. So we fixate on something because we have no choice in terms
of picking out all the boumas with sufficient confidence; and we
regress when the next fixation reveals a problem with the boumas the
parafovea gave us in the previous fixation - but that&rsquo;s OK because it
means we&rsquo;re making good speed overall.</p>
<p>I have yet to hear a better explanation that addressed the fact that
saccades far exceed the letterwise acuity of the fovea. If Pelli for
example implies that long saccades cannot be functional, his data
must be flawed because they exist! The subconscious brain is much
more clever than any researcher. The data cannot lead the way, only
our logic can do that.</p>
<p>I previously wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Larson has convinced me at least, the fovea
does not need more than individual letters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually I do see room to move on that: if the brain
can pick out multi-letter boumas in the fovea, I guess
there&rsquo;s no reason it shouldn&rsquo;t, since that saves time.
I just don&rsquo;t know if the processing overhead (I mean
once the boumas are known) makes that moot or not.</p>
<p>In the parafovea we have no choice because individual
letters cannot be identified with enough confidence.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is what designers are doing, although I understand that many of them may <em>think</em> that is what they are doing. I think what designers are actually doing is making the necessarily different (distinctly recognisable) letters visually similar in a variety of ways, such that no letter strays into a different spatial frequency channel or otherwise disrupts the reader. Part of this does involve what I call knitting of words &ndash; making internally cohesive, as you say &ndash;: creating a flexible but reasonably consistent internal periodicity in the arrangement of features, which establishes the integrity of the word as a textual linguistic unit, but I don&rsquo;t think it follows that this implies making a word into a single perceptual unit. Obviously we perceive words as visual units, thanks to inter-word spacing and internal integrity (even in the parafovea and importantly for navigation), but it doesn&rsquo;t follow that we treat words as perceptual units for recognition purposes: it may well be that segmentation of the internally cohesive word is normal and necessary. Certainly that seems to be the case for all but the shortest and commonest words. I&rsquo;m quite happy to accept that segmentation may occur at levels above, below and through the letter level, but once one gets within the word unit, as one must, letters seem to be to have a bias in being linguistically assignable things.</p>

<p>Okay, I did. Actually, the admittedly short specimen looked somewhat better than my usual writing. The problem with writing with one&rsquo;s eyes closed isn&rsquo;t the shaping of the letters or their spacing &ndash; muscle memory is good at this &ndash;, its the growing sense of disorientation regarding the page as a whole, which limits one to short sequences. I suppose if one practised, one might be able to do longer, and presumably many people who have gone blind in later life have managed to write.</p>

Here it means taking discrete groups of 2 or 3 features (units of processing) and processing them in separate channels. I compare this to running a three- to five-legged race, where you have to team up with a neighbour that has identical shoelaces to yours. It’s awkward and involves a two-stage process, the first being feature (= leg) binding after you’ve figure out who your race partners are.</p>
<p>There are other problems as well, associated with the explicit labeling of letters.

<p>These things aren&rsquo;t decisive for selecting between your and my alternatives. Both I think are strong hypotheses. You&rsquo;ll probably grant that. There will have to be a way to decide between the two.</p>

<p>In the case of non-phonetic spelling systems this does appear to present an issue, but I think it is answered by understanding letter recognition in a role-unit way in word recognition, i.e. the place of the letter within the word is crucial to efficient word recognition so may override potentially ambiguous phonetic associations. That is, it isn&rsquo;t necessary to inhibit incipient letter recognition per se if one readily inhibits phonetic associations by filtering based on the letter role within the word. By the time one has recognised letters and correctly identified their place in the word, one is at the word recognition stage, and phonetic association is something that I would consider a bypassed mechanism, something to which the reader falls back in the case of unfamiliar words.</p>

<p>You might have noted another simplification there:
I&rsquo;m saying that whole words are taken in instead of
letters, while in fact I believe that clusters of
letters (so parts of words) are the typical bouma.</p>

<p>That actually can&rsquo;t work - and I don&rsquo;t just mean practically.
Taking conscious action is based on conscious understanding,

<p>Without both of those things I couldn&rsquo;t give <em>any</em> impression.
Should I give a caveat to that effect? Maybe. But I still think
the main idea I&rsquo;m trying to convey is being communicated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using a line of mongrels keyed to distance from

<p>But I assume you mean mongrels <em>at</em> the fixation point.
With this I agree (I just don&rsquo;t have the means). However
giving people limited time simply cannot work to convey
anything more than a &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Remember, I&rsquo;m not running an experiment (although that
does have some merit), I&rsquo;m trying to explain something to
people&rsquo;s consciousness.</p>
<p>From that previous post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason why some words are skipped and why the next saccade
will go to the n+2 word instead is because of the anticipatory
structure of sense-following which seems to be oriented to
bringing substance words into view.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not my version. No matter what it looks like the stuff
is being jumped over, without loss of meaning. So I think the brain
can figure out the mongrels* (up to a point). Remember, boumas
don&rsquo;t have to be made of letters. Hmmm, it&rsquo;s actually pretty cool to
think there might be a secret dictionary of symbols that our brain
accumulates and processes in order to read.</p>

<p>According to the Keith Rayner review, by and large only “function” words are skipped, not “content” words, and even those, only about 25 percent of the time. What’s skipped is skipped because in these instances coarse featural coding has provided in enough information about what&rsquo;s there to make full visual word-form resolution unneccessary. The same can not be said for the new word that gets fixated in.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a reasonable hypothesis that frequency accounts for the bias for skipping function words, but I wouldn&rsquo;t rule out their role as a factor. By function words, I understand syntactically functional words, i.e. those that organise the sense of an utterance. Since there is a limited number of syntactical organisations of sense, and these are quite regular in languages such as English that have fairly consistent word ordering and heavy reliance on function words &ndash; contra languages with extensive noun declension, flexible word order, and agglutination &ndash;, it seems to me quite likely that we can often skip perception of function words because our brains fill in the syntax readily and accurately.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible to take &lsquo;stroke&rsquo; as a metaphor, rather than accepting the stroke as a theory, but I understand your desire for an alternative. Tim Donaldson just says &lsquo;line&rsquo;, but that seems to me to fail to capture the sense of area of the black, and perhaps suggests something to you too much like a skeleton. The best descriptive alternative I can come up with is too much of a mouthful: bounded structural element.</p>

<p>Nice!</p>
<p>My <em>role-unit</em> is, and has always been, a “bounded structural element” of an intermediate complexity somewhere between simple features and letter wholes. Role units are prototypical structures, not literal shapes.</p>
<p>I used to use just <em>role</em>, and got terms like <em>role-architecture</em> and <em>role-architecturally evoked form</em> from that. Bill Berkson suggested I use <em>role-unit</em> instead.</p>
<p>I picked up <em>role</em> from Douglas Hofstadter’s 1982 “Metafont, Metamathematics, and Metaphysics: Comments on Donald Knuth&rsquo;s Article ‘The Concept of a Meta-Font’”. For Hofstadter, roles can be filled in different ways. For example an old-style a fills the a bowl-role in a different ways than a didoni a.</p>
<p>For the introduction of the term <em>role</em> into typographic discourse, see: Hofstadter, Douglas R., “Metafont, Metamathematics, and Metaphysics: Comments on Donald Knuth&rsquo;s Article ‘The Concept of a Meta-Font’” <em>Visible Language</em>, Vol. XVI no. 4, pp. 309-338 (republished in Hofstadter&rsquo;s book Metamagical Themas, NY: Basic Books, 1985)</p>
