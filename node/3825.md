body: Hi Guys and Gals, <BR>here is my first attempt at making a font, I&#39;m using
  fontographer 3.5 I had no idea how it worked when I started &#40;although I do use
  llustrator and photoshop everyday&#41;, and I have only a little more now. <BR>
  <BR>I am completely new to the world of typography and font creation and this font
  has been created as a titling font for my boyfriends new comic &#40;published late
  november&#41;. <BR> <BR>All comments welcome, it is meant to be quite quirky, but
  any technical criticisms may need to be explained as I haven&#39;t got all the terminology
  down pat yet. <BR> <BR>Anyway that&#39;s enough rambling let&#39;s get on with it.
  <BR>be gentle. <BR>Jen <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2956.jpg"

  body: ' Looks good to me. Can you explain more about your boyfriend comic&#39;s?
    Who&#39;s the target? Well here is my comment: <BR>1. Looks good as far as I see,
    but the lc &#39;s&#39; seem a little bit thin than the other lc. Maybe you need
    to make it more fat. <BR>2. I don&#39;t understand why the 3,4,5 looks narrower
    than the other. <BR>3. I like the way you treat the curve on lc &#39;g&#39;. <BR>4.
    The uc looks fine. <BR> <BR>I guess that&#39;s all from me. Guys any comment?
    <BR>Sorry about my bad English. <BR> <BR>&#43;ep&#43; '

  body: Jen, please set a sentence in your font so we can see the letters in context.
    It might help us appreciate its &#34;quirkiness&#34; <BR> <BR>My initial impression
    is that the varying weight and character widths could be better unified. Right
    now they seem all over the board.  <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t think of the &#34;R&#34;
    as a &#34;P&#34; with another leg. It&#39;s its own animal. <BR> <BR>jb

  body: Eka- <BR>Thanks so much for replying! <BR>I will fix the &#39;s&#39; and the
    numbers, you are so right! <BR>here is the first mock up of the cover so you can
    see what it would look at in contxt - obviousley the masthead letters have been
    modified but I wanted to leave the font useable as well as use it&#39;s basic
    form for the masthead. <BR> <BR> <BR>Jared- <BR>Thank you too! <BR>I&#39;ve posted
    a quick brown fox below, as i&#39;ve said I&#39;m using fg 3.5 and I&#39;m having
    a lot of trouble understanding the way it works and the whole kerning thing. <BR>I
    had stacks of problems with some of the letters, I think I may need to do some
    hand lettering practise &#40;something i haven&#39;t done since my calligraphy
    phase in high school!&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>jen

  body: ' I would reduce the word spaces down to at least half what they are now.  <BR>
    <BR>Also, I think the baseline is unnaturally even for a style like this. I would
    let it vary about the same amount as the x-height. A good way to think about it
    is to imagine an invisible line about halfway up the x-height. The lowercase letters
    should appear to be bouncing slightly up and down from this line. Right now, it
    looks like they are all sitting solidly on the baseline which fights against the
    lively, unhinged quality of the font. '

  body: Okee I&#39;ve made those changes... <BR>I&#39;ve had a fiddle with the baseline
    like you said Mark, gosh it was hard to force myself to do this, I probably haven&#39;t
    taken it as far as I could really. &#40; I actually didn&#39;t realise you could
    change the space! but I found it&#41; <BR>for anyone interested you can download

  body: I like the crazyness of the uppercase the fact that it is all over the board,
    weight wise and such, yet managing the same relative proportion, height, character
    balance, there&#39;s nice bows, like the T, which is going to start off many a
    &#34;The&#34; sentences. the X and Y could use a thicker variation somewhere

  body: ' I think you went a bit too far on the bouncing effect, but the word spacing
    looks much better. I would tend not to bump letters up that are already tall &#40;those
    with ascenders&#41; or down for those that have descenders. You don&#39;t want
    to be too obvious about it either. Set lots of different words and adjust anything
    that calls too much attention. '

    Hrant, <BR>Thanks for replying! Can you suggest any resources &#40;online or off&#41;
    where I might find this sort of information. I&#39;ve heard a lot about kerning
    pairs without actually know what the pairs are, is this what you are talking about
    in relation to which letters i bump? <BR>jen '

  body: 'Kerning pairs are meant to fix horizontal spacing anomalies &#40;too much/little
    space between glyphs, like between the &#34;Ty&#34; pair&#41;, so they benefit
    from linguistics too &#40;although arguably less&#41;; but kerning pairs are not
    inherently related to the &#34;bumping&#34; as far as I can think. <BR> <BR>A
    good source? Cryptanalisis/cryptography. I use some books I have, but here&#39;s
    the top Google hit for &#34;cryptanalysis digraphs&#34;: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~umich/fm-34-40-2/"

    and on.&#41; <BR> <BR>BTW, you can/should also look at the most frequent &#42;words&#42;
    &#40;which will quickly show you the most serious problematic situations&#41;,
    and for the top 100 in English you can look at the far right of: <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/s_quality.html"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/s_quality.html</A> <BR> <BR>But frequency
    is only part of the picture. There are very many words that are not common but
    do cause unfortunate spacing - &#34;spikes&#34; in language; which is why most
    type designers use long premade/canned lists of pairs/words to check their work.
    I wouldn&#39;t worry about those for your &#34;bumpiness&#34; &#40;since things
    have to average out anyway&#41;, but for the &#34;higher reaches&#34; of spacing
    &#40;where adding a kerning pair doesn&#39;t hurt anything else&#41; you need
    that too. <BR> <BR>hhp'
