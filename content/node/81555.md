    site. Getting error messages one after another. Don't know why.\r\nThis one slipped
    through. On all the others I asked for help to ID the caps.\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nMara"

  body: "Except for the grunge T, the sans serif letters are close to <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larstornqvist/simpliciter-sans/\">Simpliciter
    Sans</a>, but the K is wrong, or else <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/letter-gothic-bt/\">Letter
    Gothic 12 Pitch</a>, but the I is wrong.\r\n\r\nMy eyes are blurring, but these
    have similar structural shapes.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
