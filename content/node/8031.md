  body: I think it looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/compacta/compacta/testdrive.html?s=SECRET+AGENT&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Compacta</a> with a modified S, G and probably the N. One reason
    I picked it, is that the C has the same longer lower &#39;chin&#39;, rather than
    being symmetrical. I know the poster for the thread James mentioned said it was
    NOT Compacta, but I think that was based on the mismatch of the modified letters.
    <BR> <BR>Sure there may be a newer font out there, but other than House Gothic
    23, I can&#39;t think of anything this close. <BR> <BR>My vote is customized Compacta.

  body: My vote goes to Binderstile Bold, which seems to be a perfect match down to
    the ink traps. The only digital version I&#39;m aware of &#40;I have it&#41; is
    Brendel Informatik&#39;s <a href="http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm" target="_blank">
    Report Bold</a>, but my link yields only a crappy image of it I&#39;m afraid.
    Perhaps someone with a better catalog representation of Bindertile Bold than the
    Solotype Catalog offers can confirm &#40;or reject&#41; the ID. <BR> <BR>

  body: I&#39;ll second that. I checked some old type catalogs, and it matches Binderstile
    Bold.

    original stretched image.

    CD referred to above.
