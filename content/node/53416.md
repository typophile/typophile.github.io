  someone asks for type suggestions (looking for a font solution), people generously
  offer links to sites with a certain font.\r\nthe \"problem\" as i see it (which
  is a minor one, but still), is that the thread remains visualy sterile. i think
  type samples should appear on thread, with links, but not as links to an external
  site. this would make things easier for a potential client to see the fonts.\r\nso
  what i was thinking about (and no, i am not a programmer), is a kind of engine,
  where you can click on a certain font (with a certain weight) from a certain type
  foundry on a popup box, enter some sample words, and the font will appear on the
  reply in the thread, so people would be able to see the suggestions clearly. i think
  that type foundries would love the idea of showing their fonts on typophile.\r\n\r\ni
  hope i wrote it good. \r\nyaronimus."

    has such a feature. AFAIK, it works with all the fonts from MyFonts (at least
    those without restrictions). Via a simple code, you can insert a sample with your
    own custom text. The sample has a link back to the MyFonts site. \r\nMaybe Ralf
    can shed more light on this feature and its implementation?\r\nF"

    Progress is good for everyone!

    a good reason.\r\nDesigners, not clients, should choose fonts.\r\nBut I agree
    with your sentiment that Typophile should be more visual."
