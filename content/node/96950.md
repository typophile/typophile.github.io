  just looking to see if anyone had a typeface recommendation. :) "

    Mother of God: once upon a time, you actually had to know something in order to
    call yourself a designer. Now, you just proclaim yourself one on the internet,
    and see it someone buys it.\r\n\r\nOkay: I can see some advantages to such an
    approach. I kinda like the Ring of NickStudmuffin48\u2026"

    scripts</a>. Maybe you\u2019ll find something fitting there? It would be hard
    to find an exact match for proportions and style, but you could try your own hand
    at an M. Another option is asking Laura herself to draw you a custom variant.
    That would probably be the best option!"

    something to mix with the Shelby typeface with contrast, not something that imitated
    it! But thanks for the suggestions. \r\n\r\nNick: Please don't troll on my forum
    posts again. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCraig"

  body: "The \u201Chipster traditional\u201D logo style often uses these kind of scripts
    paired with square or narrow grotesques (Trade Gothic, Knockout etc) or wide slab
    serifs (Hellenic Wide) center-aligned. In any case, blending in should rarely
    be the goal when designing a logotype."

  body: Thanks for your suggestions Frank! I don't want them to blend, I'm just trying
    update their logo which is currently in Wisdom Script. I've seen it used well
    a lot but as a logo, it's slant makes it difficult to incorporate into different
    designs. That's why I wanted to use the Shelby font and find a slab serif that
    went with it well. I just wasn't finding anything that had a good "M." That's
    why I was looking for you guys' suggestions. I checked out the Hellenic Wide etc,
    those are cool but I think the band will want something still a little bit more
    cosmopolitan and girly. I really appreciate your suggestions though! I'm still
    on the hunt! :)
