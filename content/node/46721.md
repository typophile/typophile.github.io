body: "We burned our bras and the traditions of polite society in the 1960s.  Perhaps
  the post-Victorian, war-torn, Democracy-mongering notions of social form became
  outmoded, but, with the ruin of rules for civil engagement, how have three generations
  of Americans learned to get along.\r\n\r\nBy looking at examples of communication
  tools for written correspondence we can perhaps get a glimpse at what we have learned
  about polite society and what we have lost.\r\n\r\nI will be presenting this engaging
  topic on Sunday, July 20 during the afternoon session of \"Type in 20\".\r\n\r\nI
  will talk about the usefulness of the hand written note and about the outstanding
  successs rate for sending a real live letter through the mail to a new friend or
  potential client.  All attendees will walk away with instruction in and a copy of
  \"How to Write a Personal Letter\".\r\n\r\nwww.nancysharoncollinsstationer.com\r\n\r\n\"I
  have been engaged with the process of commercial engraving for the purpose of making
  social stationery since 1977. Since then I have watched the rich polish of polite
  society decline to a harsh commercial glare.\"--Nancy Sharon Collins Artist's Statement,

  body: 'You are right about the getting a live letter opposed to an email or an im.
    I have not received a real letter since the one that Leah sent me for class. It
    was actually exciting to the mail box and have somebody taken time out of their
    day to write me. It makes you feel special and that someone cares alot. I feel
    like polite society has pretty much disappeared since the introduction to technology.
    I feel that actual physical interaction is not that important to people any more
    which is sad. '

  body: "Christilisa,\r\n\r\nI am reading, \"Custom of the Country\" by Edith Wharton
    written in 1913, do you know her work?  Although she was a rich white lady from
    the north east, she was very bright and speaks a lot about what \"polite society\"
    required of women at that time.  I first read her about twenty years ago and have
    not had much patience for her since.\r\n\r\nHowever, something about her messages
    or stories resonate today.\r\n\r\nDuring the last (and every) industrial revolution
    where technology runs wild ahead of our creative control, it seems that vast wastelands
    of humanity lie in its wake.  Maybe now that smart, young people are slowly gaining
    control of all this crazy hard wiring and software we can all find a little bit
    of humanity again.  (At least for another hundred years before the next big wave.)"

    I\u2019m scared to death that my lawyers friends might expect me to read the output
    of wrists warped by endless note-taking and Blackberry messaging. It\u2019s something
    like reading prescriptions by Steadman.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this year I moved up from
    embossed thank-you cards to handmade cards and envelopes. It was quite gratifying."

  body: I have not heard of her work but I will look for it and read her. I hope you
    a right about us being able to find a bit if humanity again because at the moment
    it does not feel that way. It would be nice to get back to hand written letters
    as well as actually talking to people more opposed to how it is now.

  body: "Dear James,\r\n\r\nI have a very dear friend who is rather successful and
    has been on the Esquire \"Best Dressed\" list several times (for whatever that's
    worth) so he is an \"expert\" of sorts about style. He always writes hand written
    correspondence. I don't get to see him often but I do occasionally receive something
    from him in the mail.  His handwriting is not legible, at all, but his writing
    is distinctive and is a delight to see amongst the junk we bring from the box
    of mail.  Even though I can barely read a word I can tell that he is okay.  To
    me, it is the same feeling I get when I run into him and I actually get to see
    into his stylish face directly.\r\n\r\nAfter 9/11 and the anthrax attacks I was
    wondering if we would ever correspond by mail again.  This is when I started writing
    my return address on the face of envelopes that I address in cursive.  I recommend
    my clients do this too even when sending out multiple invitations.  That cover\u2013that
    face of a letter IS the same as a person's facial expression.  You can usually
    see if it is a happy hand or one cramped and mean.  I remember when my Father's
    hand began to look infirm, this was when my Mom got really ill and she went into
    hospital for the very last time.  I thought this change would go away but even
    though he writes correspondence every single evening, his hand never regained
    that confidence or strength.  And he looks now like an old man which he did not
    used to.\r\n\r\nI have been told that less and less cursive (or penmanship of
    any kind) is being taught in schools.  The thoughts generated by the deliberate
    quality of taking pen to paper uses a different portion of the brain than keystroking.\r\n\r\nI
    will get the book citation and post it\u2013about two years ago a reference handbook
    was published by librarians about \"computer mediated information\".\r\n\r\nWhen
    I keystroke, or type, a machine mediates my thoughts.  With a pen or pencil in
    my hand my thought process feels different, more reverential, as if I am actually
    taking the time to think about what I am saying.  This is a practical notion because
    it is a lot easier to delete and re-type electronically than it is to correct
    a letter in long hand.\r\n\r\nCongratulations on handmade cards and envelopes,
    feels good, doesn't it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jhw_3963.jpg]\r\n<em>Funny
