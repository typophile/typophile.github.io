  files with a PC virus! I need to re-do the logo but for the life of me I can't remember
  what the one of the fonts I used was! I have lost all .ai files and only have flat
  graphics - I also lost a lot of fonts with the virus! I've tried 'what the font'
  but it's not coming up with the correct one!\r\n\r\nHope someone can help me!\r\n\r\nJen"
