  right typeface \r\nfor this festival. It seems like egyptienne \r\na slab serif
  typeface is heading in the \r\nright direction. The didot logo appears\r\nto be
  too \"high class.\" I need to make it \r\nfeel more youthful, without using a sans\r\nserif
  typeface. \r\n\r\nI still have some kering issues and \r\ncomposition problems,
  but I really need \r\nto decide on a primary Logotype.\r\n\r\nI would like to hear
  your reactions on the logo, \r\nand suggestions on the typography.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDerrick"

    ban on sans? That slab you're using looks clean, but it's not exactly youthful...
    And that \"Q\" is lame; it's meant for setting multiple lines of caps (and not
    having them crash) so you might like to replace the tail with something more...
    youthful. :-)  Maybe make it curl backwards into the space between the two words
    below. And why keep the \"2010\" in Didot? You could use a different font, but
    the Didot is clashing with the Egyptian.\r\n\r\nBTW, that island illustration
    is beautiful, but the first thing that popped into my head is making the island
    outline look like it's emanating sound waves - you know, vibrating out. Or is
    that what you've already done? Because it looks more like a typical topographic
    map - maybe too literal for a place that's not actually an island (at least not
    geographically :-).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    John Vanderslice, Andrew Bird and Bon Iver. \r\n\r\nI will experiment with some
    sans serif typefaces, Trade,\r\nInterstae, Din, Helvetica, Etc. I had originally
    had a sans\r\nserif typeface, but my professor wanted me to try some\r\nexploration
    with the serifs. I mean, I could attempt to \r\nremove the bowls and counters,
    or something to that\r\neffect for a more youthful feel. \r\n\r\nThe \"Q\" is
    very lame! Ha ha, I will try to do something\r\nwith that. I am going to create
    some sans serif logotypes\r\nand post them. \r\n\r\nI had originally intended
    to put the sound waves into an\r\nafter effects commercial, but I will try to
    incorporate that \r\ninto some future renditions of the logo. Thanks for pointing\r\nthat
    out. \r\n\r\nThanks for your help, I really appreciate the feed back! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It will be very hard to use these graphics you made as a logo. Try applying
    it to business card, memorandum etc. in small sizes, and you will see your mistake.
    First example will work poorly in black and white situations for example and in
    small sizes. Second example has problem that first also has - too many details
    that will loose eventually when applied, especially, again, small sizes. \r\nHave
    you tried printing them?\r\n\r\nAgain, you could use these as visuals or graphics
    on banners, flags, other print material in big sizes but using festival's wordmark
    as a logo. You are trailing yourself a good path creating identity - identity
    that doesn't relies only on logo but on some kind of wordmark and set of graphics,
    visuals, illustrations (how do you want to call them).\r\n\r\nHope it is clearer

    large print and \r\ncommercial/ website and media materials?\r\n"

  body: "I think that you couldn't make two version because in start this is not really
    a logo. Printed it would look like a black/grey stain or smudge of colors. You
    have a mark that is not actually a mark, it is free floating graphics/visual and
    it is too large in relating to type. So you wouldn't really benefit in the end.
    \r\n\r\nSecond tought is to start again, from scratch making a simple logo or
    on other hand creating something that has same idea - set of visuals that later
    combines with wordmark and thus applying it to business cards, memorandums and
    then banner and so on. \r\nSorry, I cannot remember now of identities of extended
    visuals combined with wordmark.\r\n\r\nDefine your problem at first, and then
    decide what to create and which way to go. Music and festivals are great projects
    to work for.\r\n\r\nGood luck. \r\n_\r\n\r\nSandro"

    serifs - all the sans you mentioned are not warm. I think you headed the right
    direction with your slab intuition but the one you picked is cold. Try to find
    something warm and personal, perhaps even retro, if you could hand letter it,

  body: "I think it's probably too modern. One nice thing about Archer is that it
    has small caps, which would be nice for this. But I went over to the HTF website
    and tried it - just felt a bit modern to me. I also tried Giza over at MyFonts.com
    and almost liked it - that's more the direction I was thinking of.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing I have learned from doing exactly what you're doing right now (asking others
    for their opinions) is that it can get very confusing. So I hope that doesn't
    happen, ultimately you need to execute YOUR vision, not mine.\r\n\r\nAll that
    being said, I think something a bit retro and irregular would work better.\r\n\r\nBTW
    - I've done a few logos for music festivals and I ended up drawing all of them.
    It also helps when someone cannot easily imitate the trademark for an event.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "Paul is right that this is too \"modern\" for folk music. Also these lines
    and visuals are also maybe too modern for folk music. Try to explore folk music,
    folk art maybe, try to find visuals, patterns, try to find its identity, try to
    find everything about Presque isle regarding the folk music. Sans or serif, it
    is all up too you, depends on feel and how do you want to communicate. \r\n\r\nI
    see that you cut the type part of your visuals but again, this cannot go into
    logotype/wordmark box:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logotype_4433_4989.jpg]\r\n\r\nThink
    of ratios of all elements that you combine. Year, place, these thin lines and
    shapes are all too small, and you are going into decoration with all these elements.
    Design is not just formalism and technicality.\r\n\r\nOther thoughts are that
    you could go with primary, secondary and maybe tertiary versions of logo. Adding
    place and date in secondary versions or in tertiary. \r\n\r\nhttp://gapersblock.com/transmission/pitchfork-music-festival.jpg\r\n\r\nThis
    logo communicates, good example is combining the year that is differentiated from
    name with color.\r\n\r\np.s Animal please when you type don't use forced lined
    brake with enter, it gets very hard to read what you have written. Thanks\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nSandro"

  body: Thanks for your help Paul and Sandro! I really like the idea of a primary,
    secondary and tertiary logo. I will explain the proper use of each in my visual
    identity manual. I understand how the typical folk music festival could look,
    I am trying to put a twist on it. I am trying to avoid the cliche "folky" aesthetic.
    It may not be working though.
