    If any mods/admins want to move this, please do so!

    you still think a geometric sans is your preferred way to dip in type design,
    you could want to look here first: http://typographica.org/on-typography/making-geometric-type-work/"

    A lot of people seem to start with a geometric typeface, thinking it's easier.
    It may well be, but most of them produce very bad typefaces. It's probably to
    be expected from your first design, but if your first project is probably going
    to produce questionable results I think it's much better to learn as much from
    the project as you can, rather than trying to produce a typeface to be used. I
    certainly haven't been able to use my first projects, though I spent more than
    120 hours on my first design.\r\n\r\nMy first design was a serif typeface, and
    I honestly feel I learned a lot more from it than I would have from a geometric
    sans. So if designing a geometric typeface seems like fun, go for it. If you're
    using this first project to learn how to design typefaces, you might want to consider
    something more advanced. You will probably fail like I did, but learn a lot from
    it.\r\n\r\nAlso, here are some articles I wrote on type design: http://temple-of-typefaces.deviantart.com/blog/?offset=1\r\nThe
    post 'type resources' features a lot of good stuff, and the tutorials I made on
    type design might help you as well."
