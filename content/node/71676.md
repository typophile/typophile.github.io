  come up. At first I was reasonably OK with Georgia:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Griechisch_Georgia_4261.gif]\r\n\r\nBut
  I'd love to find something that matches Newzald better, especially the color/weight.
  Plus, it turns out there's some more Greek in a different text, in which [at least
  my version of] Georgia can't display all characters. I'm assuming this is Polytonic
  Greek?\r\nUsing Lucida Grande:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Griechisch_Screenshot_4442.gif]\r\n.\r\nThere
  is not a lot of Greek, but I'd really like it to not be too jarring. \r\nCan anyone
  point me towards a font that supports Polytonic Greek, would work with Newzald (think
  Fleischmann/Rosart, Transitional, narrowish vertical, relatively dark) and if possible
  doesn't cost an arm and a leg? I only need regular weight, but with italics.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help!"

    this case, so actually not too \xABtraditional\xBB \u2013 both in terms of blending
    in (there is very little Greek, and the Latin should be allowed to set the tone

    \r\nI need Roman+Italic to be rather distinct (I'm dealing with situations like

    I think there's a middle ground between matching and jarring: A complementary
    non-match is better than an imperfect attempt at matching.\r\n\r\nThough I don't
    have my copy (copies) of <em>Elements of Typographic Style</em> handy, I think
    Robert Bringhurst suggests something like this when combining Latin and Greek
    (and Cyrillic) scripts. I seems to me that when you're using a type doesn't have
    Greek letters, it might be best to look for something different enough not to
    look like a bad match. It's kind of like the style convention of using italic
    for occasional foreign words (using Latin script) within an English language text.\r\n\r\nI
    like the idea of a sans like  Fedra -- or any Greek face that's got workable proportions
    but less stroke contrast than Newzald. Let us know how your experiments with it

    to an existing (if different) Latin font gives it the sort of attitude that allows
    it to blend into a Latin body (something I think the very culturally-authentic
    Greek-dominated fonts would not do to the same degree); and I think in this setting
    I really need the Latin to dominate. On the other hand, I enjoy how Greta has
    a slightly fresher and rougher attitude, especially in the Italics, that keeps
    it from being completely subservient. \r\n\r\nIf the client doesn't like this,
