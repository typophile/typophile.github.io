body: "This is something I've been working on in my off-time at work. The idea was
  sort of a mesh between sans-serif and script, taking cues from calligraphy but keeping
  it pretty subdued.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as I was laying out the beziers, I kept
  getting that \"I've seen this shape before\" feeling. Is there already something
  exactly like this out there, that I've been subconsciously stealing? Or in other
  words, is this face even worth continuing?\r\n\r\nHere's the progress so far. No
  spacing yet; it's all in Illustrator. And I know something has to happen to the
  N, I haven't been able to nail it down yet. Comments and questions please!\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think it has a somewhat Art Nouveau feel, that reminds me of <a href="http://www.identifont.com/find?font=auriol&q=Go">Auriol</a>
    or <a href="http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Arnold&q=Go">Arnold Boecklin</a>,
    but it is much more simplified and perhaps nicer and more usable than those. I'd
    say finish it and see what happens.

    something so we can see what it does?

  body: "Thanks Brad - I think it was Arnold Boeklin that was making me uneasy. Never
    really liked that face, but I've seen it (and its imitators) enough that apparently
    it's crept into my subconscious.\r\n\r\nHere's something to see how it reads...
    I think no matter how great this turns out, it's not going to be something to
    set all caps!\r\n\r\nIt's pretty short too; lengthy paragraphs will have to wait
    until I get these things imported into fontographer.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scripty1_4515.png]"

  body: "<cite> Hey, I think it looks great in all-caps! In fact I actually think
    it\u2019s looking better than the lc\u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nI agree. The lc t is
    weak next to it's kin. For some reason I find the UC E objectionable. Maybe it
    looks to Boxy in general. Maybe it would benefit from a smaller top story & a
    bigger Bottom... The UC A is a bit too tall & a bit too heavy on top.\r\n\r\nKeep
    going.\r\n\r\nWhat do you see this used for? Packaging come to my mind... maybe
    it's that CREAM."

  body: "Update - finally got all the caps drawn, so now it's time for tweaks.\r\n\r\nI
    wholly agree, Eben, and the E is now more roundy and bottom-heavy, t is a bit
    beefier, A is a little more grounded etc.\r\n\r\nThanks a million by the way,
    poms; everybody likes some applause now and then.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scripty2_4072.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy
    first instincts: v, y, and z are a touch too light; m and J are too heavy and
    J is riding low; M's left leg is off-balance, and U is too square, especially
    on the right of the bowl. Any other spots jump out at you that could use some
    spit and polish?"

  body: "v, - I bet you could pull the left side in a touch & solve that. Not totally
    sure because of the scale of the rendering...\r\n\r\ny, - Maybe - or you could
    extend the foot slighty.\r\n\r\nz - Yes.\r\n\r\nm - m is tricky. Lighten the 1st
    hump & maybe think about a faux serif for the right side like you have for the
    v or the top of the R\r\n\r\nJ - You could pull it up. Or you could work on the
    curve & let it be more gentle maybe. Maybe the top should be more bone like. Your
    I has that.\r\n\r\nj - I like it.\r\n\r\nM - why that kind of M? You don't have
    to match the 'W'. Your ARD are really nice Maybe you should think what matches
    them better.\r\n\r\nU - I think it's working well enough for now. I would go after
    biger fish for now.  \r\n\r\nOther things: \r\n\r\n- The top of Q is too low,
    the vertical of the b seems a little heavy, Maybe the right side of the cross
    bar on the f could be made heavier?, I really like the movement in the top of
    the b and I see it in the i too. Maybe it could find it's way into other glyphs
    such as the l,h,f,\r\n\r\nThat C is tasty.\r\n\r\nThis is really coming along!"

  body: "Thanks Eben and Hrant, very helpful. I know it's been forever, since I've
    been working on this only during \"free time\" at work, but it's coming along.\r\n\r\nI
    widened the apertures and the decorative gaps between strokes quite a bit, because
    they were closing off at small sizes. I think I've evened the cap height out enough
    now, and I'm getting a better handle on the M / W question. I'm not sure now about
    the lowercase x though.\r\n\r\nMore comments please! All the help is greatly appreciated.

    maybe try a narrower lc 'a' to contrast with he rounder lc 'e' you have. I bet

    - especially if you plan to pull it tighter which I think you should.\r\n\r\nThis

    second a works better; when the first one gets that narrow it starts to look like
    a u. Actually I think I might widen the a out again, just a bit.\r\n\r\nOf course
    now the l and stem of the d, u, and p are sticking out as too dark.\r\n\r\nThoughts?
