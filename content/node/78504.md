  body: Back in the day, PLINC had standard faces like this in weights from 000 to

  body: Nick's right. Likely film. Closest digital may be <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/lightline_gothic_std/?affid=99346">Lightline
    Gothic</a>. See also <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/font_bureau/titling_gothic_condensed_thin/?affid=99346">Titling
