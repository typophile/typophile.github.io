    migration is starting to come through and I am almost daily attacked by our local
    cardinals who know I carry peanuts. They know me by sight, its pretty funny.

    him as an endangered species and use that to make them force them to keep the
    mall open.\r\n\r\n(Historical background for non-Torontarians. This mall is slated
    for renewal, and initially it was to be done in stages. Recently the developers
    decided instead to level the place, and then rebuild. The mall walkers and other
    residents are up in arms about it, but have made no headway to date.)"

  body: "An affordance is the design aspect of an object that suggests how the object
    should be used. Not only objects but also substances, places, surfaces, shapes,
    etc. For ex. When you hold a pencil in such a way that it fits comfortably in
    the hand, you say that the pencil affords being held in this way as a result of
    its lenght, width, weight and texture, all with respect to the size, configuration
    and musculature of the hand. It's common when you talk about a door handle for
    example...when you look at it, you should be able to establish immediately how
    this should be used...otherwise you are going to stand in front of the door not
    knowing automatically what you should do with the handle in order to open the
    door. Basically your E affords a nest for your bird because of its shape etc etc...another
    good example is the stork (I think this is the name of the bird that nests on
    chimneys...you know, the one that delivers babies :)\r\nIt's fascinating stuff,
    usually apllied to product design. Serious: I may need your pic but I'll let you
    know what I am doing and how I'll use your photo. Thanx again! Great stuff....\r\nIf
    it's not too much trouble I'd love the original file by email maybe. Rest assured
    you will be credited..."

  body: "J. J. Gibson \r\nJames Jerome Gibson (1904-1979)  American psychologist,
    considered one of the most important 20th century psychologists in the field of
    visual perception. In his classic work The Perception of the Visual World (1950)
    he rejected the behaviorism then fashionable for a view based on his own experimental
    work, which pioneered the idea that animals 'sampled' information from the 'ambient'
    outside world. He also invented the word 'affordance': the interactive possibilities
    of a particular object or environment. This concept has been extremely influential
    in the field of design and ergonomics: see for example the work of Donald Norman
    who worked with Gibson, and has adapted many of his ideas for his own theories.\r\n\r\nThis
