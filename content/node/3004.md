    Small Caps are similar.  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a little comparison, your sample
    vs Janson SC vs Janson SC modified &#40;which looks thicker than it&#39;s supposed
    to because I had to scale the tiny sample screenshot from MyFonts: <BR> <BR><img

  body: If you choose Janson SC use bar-less &#34;A&#34;s, as the &#34;V&#34; <BR>has
    a little nick in the join/corner.
