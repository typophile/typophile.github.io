body: Well, it&#39;s come a long way from the last idea I had. I&#39;m looking for
  critique on anything.  Background - I&#39;m into illustrations with a cartoon feel.  I
  want the logo to be playful but profressional.  Any help is appreciated. <BR><img

  body: I see indecision.  <BR> <BR>Adam, your type and your illustration are fighting
    for attention with neither winning. The logo needs a better sense of hierarchy.  <BR>
    <BR>I found both the image and type too generic and open to interpretation.. and
    therefore a bit weak. You&#39;re coming across as &#39;any guy&#39; rather than
    as &#39;that individual&#39;. Don&#39;t play safe, try for a stronger expression
    of that personality you seek.

  body: 'Hey Adam...  <BR> <BR>First of - I like the colour green...and the illustration
    is funny, but if you want to say Illustrations - I would put in more illustration
    and less type. And speaking of type. To me, Futura is to ordinary and I&#39;m
    really bored with it. I understand you want it to be more business like - just
    make the type black and let the illustration speak. <BR> <BR>Or maybe you could
    make the type interact more with the illustration - make it part of the illustration
    maybe? <BR> <BR>Just a few thoughts... <BR> <BR>Hey and tjek this guy out: <BR>
