  body: "Just curious what the planned application will be? I don't imagine this being
    a very useful/easy to read text copy. Are you creating a logo with it? If so,
    I'd recommend going the extra step and reproducing it by hand with real ink and
    brushes.\r\n\r\nI did a basic brush script search at myfonts and came across some
    designs that are similar:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/andinistas/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/misprinted/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/vincent/\r\n\r\nMost
    of these seem like grunge/brush scripts."
