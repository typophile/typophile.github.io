  appreciate some help, been looking for this font and just cannot find it. Maybe
  some awesome perosn on here has any ideas of what it may be. I am specifically concerned
  about the Q, that is the letter for that is the most unique and not identifiable."

    Haven't found a perfect match though but I have one that have all earmarks so
    may be simply a bit edited: /R vertical leg, /S, /Q horizontal tail. It's [[http://www.dafont.com/sf-movie-poster.font|Movie
    Poster SF]], very close but still a bit condensed comparing to original... So
    may be that's it... Actually it mixes influences from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/engschrift|DIN
    Engschrift]] (mainly /S) and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers|Univers]]
    Ultra Condensed (/Q tail, /R vertical leg).\r\nSome more alternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/block-gothic-rr|Block
