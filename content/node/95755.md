  happy to announce a new version of <strong>Nitti</strong>! We\u2019ve (finally)
  added italics to this mighty popular family, and Pieter took the opportunity to
  tweak and improve many details in the roman styles as well.\r\n\r\nNow, with five
  weights, and support for Latin, Cyrillic and Greek this is our most complete typeface
  family yet. And we\u2019re offering a temporary 25% discount on all styles of Nitti
  to celebrate its release!\r\nMore info: <a href=\"http://www.boldmonday.com/en/nitti\">http://www.boldmonday.com/en/nitti</a>\r\n\r\nBest
  wishes from Den Haag!\r\n<strong>Bold Monday</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.boldmonday.com/\">www.boldmonday.com</a>"
