  body: If we're talking for extended text, I'd say something like Caslon or Janson.
    For what purpose exactly is this intended? Knowing that might suggest other, or
    more appropriate, choices.

    in the kitchen..vs two men sitting at a table...

  body: Well, that's hard to say. I'm building a tool for two people to use when having
    an extended, informal conversation. It's a replacement for long conversations
    that might otherwise be held through email. So the two participants and what they
    say may vary widely.
