    by Walter J. Diethelm is a good match.

    ever make Italics?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I arrived at Arrow after looking at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/seta-reta-nf/|Seta]]
    by Nick Curtis. His revival wasn't as close a match as Treacy's for the logo posted
    by darksympho. I'm not familiar with the original work of Diethelm.
