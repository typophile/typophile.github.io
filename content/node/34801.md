    has to be. the serifs are a lot shaper and thinner strokes. Wish i could see the
    HTF numbers. I could tell more by the 2.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nsf"

  body: "*Edited for idiocy*\r\nThere's nothing out there just like *HFJ Didot* in
    terms of contrast and those beautiful s-curves, but some cousins include Linotype
    Gianotten Light, Paratype Bodoni, Andrade, and for the numbers Bodoni Classic
    Bold Swashes by Wiescher Design.\r\n\r\nObviously, I had a nice tour of type looking
    for this one, but when I found it and refreshed, the answer was there. At least
    I have some more knowledge of this little corner of the world.\r\n\r\nHorton\r\nFounder,
