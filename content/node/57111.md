body: "I have used class kerning before, but just ran into a problem I had not encountered
  before. \r\n\r\nAll my previous classes were simple with both sides being the same.
  I watched a video on class kerning this evening and he explained also how to do
  class kerning on one side only. \r\nhttp://www.vimeo.com/681300?pg=embed&sec=681300\r\n\r\nIn
  this family of typefaces that I'm working on I had a handful of alternate letters
  and some ligatures that I had under the dlig feature. Previous to this I had not
  generated a kern feature since I knew I would be adding more classes. \r\n\r\nAnyway\u2026
  when I generated the kern feature on the first font with the new one-side-only kerning
  classes and then compiled it in the OT panel I got a whole list of warnings.\r\n\r\nSample:\r\n[WARNING]
  <DeSoto-Bold> Start of new pair positioning subtable; some pairs may never be accessed:
  [A Adieresis Aring Agrave Atilde Acircumflex Aacute A.alt Amacron Abreve Aogonek]
  [T T_H T_H_E T_T T_T_Y T_U T_V T_W T_Y] \r\n\r\nIt still compiles and the kerning
  seems to work as it should in the metrics window. When I deleted the new classes,
  deleted the kern feature and regenerated it without the new classes it was fine.
  Anybody know what's going on with that?\r\n\r\nHere is a sample of a left-side only
  kerning class:\r\n_Tleftside: T' T_H T_H_E T_T T_T_Y T_U T_V T_W T_Y\r\nI then checked
  the box to the right side.\r\n\r\nStephen"

    in Metrics Machine. Its group creation tool includes an error checker that shows
    where conflicts have occurred."

  body: "James, can you give me a simple example of what you mean by \xABa glyph appears
    in the same side of multiple classes\xBB. It seems like that might be a natural
    thing, but maybe I'm just not getting it. For instance, I have a class for T that
    includes all the accented T's. Then I have 2 classes for T that each have glyphs
    (ligatures} that have T on either end. Does that cause what you're referring to?"

  body: "<cite>Does that cause what you\u2019re referring to?<cite>\r\n\r\nThat could
    be the problem if there is a conflict between your ligature and duplicate T classes,
    or if you accidentally put a T into another class entirely. It might be worth
    copy/pasting those classes into text edit and looking at them blown up. I sometimes
    miss syntax problems in my classes because I have a hard time reading the tiny
    text in the class window. "
