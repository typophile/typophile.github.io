    serifless /E median crossbar, square counters, serifless /C and /S...\r\nAlternatives:
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/joe-college-nf|Joe College NF]] (wrong
    /M), [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/princetown|Princetown]] (wrong /M as spotted),

    <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/return-pass|Return Pass JNL]]</strong>
    (possibly the closest, everything is present, including boldness and wideness)"
