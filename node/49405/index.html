  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve been working casually in a printing company that dates back to 1880 (some of their equipment looks almost that old) and am considering working there more regularly. But one thing concerns me: air quality. The reek of ink and solvents is constantly present and the room where the Macs are, where I would be working, has no windows.</p>
<p>Are there known stats on printers and lung afflictions? Am I just being paranoid (or is my ambivalence about this $15/hour job showing itself) or is there actually some risk?</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;We use an inert water based protective coating sealant on our products which is an eco-friendly alternative to polymer based coatings, &ldquo;litho seal&rdquo; and plastic laminates.</p>

<p>I doubt there is any risk. Probably less than sitting in front of a computer monitor all day or putting a cell phone to your head. Smells aren&rsquo;t toxic, fumes are. If the print shop takes care to keep its solvents in safety cans, that&rsquo;s pretty much it. And that is only to prevent fire. Most solvents used today are fairly non-hazardess. And most printers seem to live an awfully long time.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>From a quick Google search:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Press operators and other workers in printing establishments<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are exposed to airborne solvent vapors generated when the press is cleaned. Press-cleaning solutions are generally a mixture of chemicals that include various solvents, some of which are carcinogens. Adverse health effects from inhalation or skin contact include dermatitis, headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, respiratory failure, central nervous system depression, coughing, difficult breathing, chest pains, unconsciousness, and death. Chronic effects may include kidney and liver damage. Many press operators in small print shops have excessive exposures because these shops frequently have inadequate ventilation or other controls for the vapors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->In printing and related industries,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a variety of chemicals — including alcohols, glues, inks, dyes, cleaners, ammonia, lead, formaldehyde, paper dusts, and many types of solvents — can be found. Employee exposures to chemicals have been shown to be higher when associated with press wash-up tasks, use of isopropanol, using poor or improper work practices, and inadequate or improper use of ventilation systems. Workers should close containers for blanket wash, alcohol, or used shop towels. Recirculating pressroom air may save on heating or cooling costs; but it also increases concentrations of chemical contaminants in the air that workers breathe.&rdquo;</p>

If you consider that you could die when crossing the street, walking in on you local nacdonald&rsquo;s &amp;c. Solvents and inks smell but the smell don&rsquo;t hurt. I guess that if you are 25 yards away from the most pollutant machine they have there you are safe. You should have seen silk screen inks from the seventies.
There is a folklore among old  printer guys in my old country that the best protection you can get is by drinking a lot of milk, or BRANDY as some others believed. Good luck.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have a small print shop (12&rsquo;x20') with 2 Vandercooks, and I&rsquo;m fairly conscious of the solvent vapours when I&rsquo;m cleaning the presses. Generally speaking I take the rollers outside and set them on a work-bench I&rsquo;ve rigged up to hold them during cleaning, and when I&rsquo;m really on the ball I wear my respirator (I&rsquo;m not on the ball all that often). When I have to clean the rollers &amp; press inside, I leave the door open and turn on a ceiling fan, and I&rsquo;m more conscious of wearing the respirator then. I have to admit, though, that this is more to avoid the dizzyness &amp; headache I sometimes get without the respirator, rather than concern about long-term effects.</p>
<p>The thing is, this is only when I&rsquo;m 2 feet from the solvent and it&rsquo;s splashing around and turning to vapour right in front of me. Other than this, what I get is the smell of ink and solvent, and, quite frankly, I love that smell.</p>
<p>Besides, I smoke, so this stuff is the least of my problem.</p>

<p>The thing is, only each individual can assess her or his health needs. If you are at all concerned about the health implications of your employment, then all your questions are valid.</p>
<p>Conditions in many printing and design shops can indeed be hazardous. Not perhaps to me, not perhaps to bieler. But they may be to you, and no one should dissuade you with flippant comments from your concerns. Each of us has different tolerances for solvents and air quality. It may sound flippant in a different way, but keep in mind that one of our main responsibilities is to take care of our own health in this nasty world. Employers won’t, unions won’t, government won’t.</p>
<p>I have worked in a wide variety of printing &amp; design shops for 40 years. Some people thrive in toxic conditions. Others succumb rapidly to what may seem to be only moderately malignant conditions. There is just no way to know what will get to whom when. I hope you can resolve this to your satisfaction.</p>
<p>&amp; given the state of the economy these days, it is just irresponsible to say such things as “why work on-site?” or “walk, and let some other mug get sick.” That set of comments shows a poor understanding of the reality of work. Sure, some folks get to work off-site. But that is a dream more than a reality in the work world of 2008. &amp; Sure, some folks are willing to let others take the fall; that just ain’t a responsible attitude.</p>
<p>Good luck; stay healthy. Keep your eyes open for a better job.</p>

<p>I thought your remark was funny, just because of who you work for. Sorry I wasn&rsquo;t more careful in how I phrased my remark.</p>
<p>As to working in rooms without holes in the walls that admit light and fresh air, I think we all know a body needs to earn a living and some time you take what you can get, and that little print shops often both can&rsquo;t afford to offer better working conditions than they do or just can&rsquo;t be bothered. Either way, those who, as I did, take jobs in whiffy print shops, can gain some valuable experience and move on, or if other aspects of the work out weight the smells, they can stay and make a career of it and can expect to live to tell about it..</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m with you there&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been a welder, a screen printer and and artist in a screen printing shop. Now I get to breathe clean fresh air, don&rsquo;t have a villan for a boss and I do apresiate all of that, although if a want to see a window I do have to get up and walk around a corner. :o)</p>
