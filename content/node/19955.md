    \"Read Naked\" from underware, too. it is a specimen book, but the printing is
    absolutely lovely. you can take the book into the sauna. there are even some printed
    pages that only show up in the sauna (or in a steamy enviroment, i held it over
    cooking water and it worked), and then you can dry it again."

    up a book at the library called \"Metro Letters, A Typeface for the Twin Cities\"
    that has a handful of typefaces on one theme (namely, Minneapolis and St Paul,
    Minnesota). It includes interviews with the various designers invited, their backgrounds,
    and a lot about the process involved. \r\n\r\nMost of the book is spent looking
    at this font:\r\nhttp://www.letterror.com/portfolio/twin/index.html (check out

    edition specimen, designed by the brilliant Brian Morgan. If you contact Ross
    (ross[at]tiro[dot]ca) you can find out more information. The Plantagenet family
    is one of those designs that seems to be under perpertual development, but you
    can enquire about licensing the current state.\r\n\r\nThe version of Plantagenet
    that comes with Max OS X is a subset that supports the Cherokee writing system.
    There is no italic for this subset.\r\n\r\nFor more information see http://www.tiro.com/Plantagenet/plantagenet_index3.html"

    tradition). Although this book isn't about a single typeface, the whole thing
