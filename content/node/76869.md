  body: "I like the sub. It's cute, in a good way. The irony really comes through!
    \r\n\r\nNone of them feel like you \"nailed\" it, but I think it's only minor
    tweaks that will make the difference. \r\n\r\nThe space between the 'u' and the
    'r' \u2014 especially in the top options \u2014 feels too wide, and the 'o' and
    the 'u' feel too close relative to the other kerning. The 'i' feels like it's
    floating alone... \r\n\r\nI can definitely say I prefer the centered \"creative
    studio\" rather than the almost-right-aligned version. \r\n\r\nThe relationship
    between the size of the text and the sub feels a little awkward in all versions.\r\n\r\nIf
    you draw imaginary guides at the tip of the nose and the tip of the tail and align
    the text with those, how does that look? Maybe slightly closer kerning overall
    to give a \"fatter\" look to the text? I think the bolder text is more in-line
    with the character of the logo, but something about it doesn't \"sit\" right,
    know what I mean?\r\n\r\nJust suggestions and thoughts, I think the sub has tonnes
    of charm, and it's a great symbol. Please share your counter-thoughts!"

  body: "Thanks for responding, Joma. I'm glad you like the mark itself - although
    I'm not exactly sure what you mean by 'irony' - but thanks! I worked with the
    kerning a bit, check out the attached version, I think the minor kerning tweaks
    are nice. I also nudged it over a little bit - what do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/curiouserlogo_rev_6070.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    agree with the centered 'creative studio', although I was hoping to balance out
    the mark - but I don't think it was working anyway. You're also right about the
    space between the mark and the text being awkward - but I too am not sure how
    to resolve it. When I make the text align with the tip and the tail of the mark,
    it looks like they start to compete with each other. Look for yourself below.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/curiouserlogo_toowide_5380.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou
    mentioned you would want the text to seem fatter - do you think you would like
    to see a heavier weight of the font itself - 900 instead of 700?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for your help!"

  body: "I feel like the line weight of the bubbles on the right is inconsistent with
    the rest.  I would also explore some other compositions.  The name and field gives
    you a lot of room for a more unexpected composition.  One to try: Scale down the
    mark about 30%, facing right at a slightly more upward angle, and place it just
    above and to the left of the <em>c</em> in <em>curiouser</em> - as if it is starting
    to swim over the word.  \r\n\r\nKerning: the <em>se</em> is too tight.  <em>ri</em>
    is problematic.  <em>io</em> too loose.\r\n\r\nI like your icon but it is overpowering
    things now because of the scale relationships."
