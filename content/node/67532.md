    as much information in as little space as possible and do consider readability
    and usability. I, for one, like to use my 23-inch screen to multi-task and I detset
    websites that upscale to full screen.\r\n"

  body: "I tend to be a full-screen browser most of the time, so I'll see that the
    material is centered, and I'm as interested in someones presentation as I am the
    content itself. I think it really depends on the content you're presenting.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're showcasing a portfolio, then I don't think <cite>claiming all of the space
    is a no-no.<cite> Anybody who is seriously looking at your work for 2-5 minutes
    should also be interested in the full scope of the presentation. Not just to say
    'full-screen' presentation, but interested in all the considerations you've made.\r\n\r\nIf
    it's a blog, or a news site or... whatever, I'm probably seeing the content in
    Google reader... and I won't know that your type is hot pink on a blue backdrop..."

  body: "Fluid layouts are okay, but remember to use limits (e.g. max-width). Also,
    centering content is great, but some padding on the left is sometimes better.\r\n\r\nIt
    all depends so much on so many factors."

  body: "Nice subject fredcastle. \r\n\r\nFor almost everything I've been centering
    content, but with a fixed 800 or even 600 pixel width. \r\n\r\nFor the first time
    I'm trying something like Typophile uses. I'm keeping a 20px left pad, four columns
    on a 10px grid that is 1000px wide. Also using three major horizontal divisions
    and just letting the right side bleed to background noise. It seems to work, but
    there is something that is making me want to gravitate to centering the content
    again. Maybe it's just habit.\r\n\r\nI'm also trying to move navigation more to
    the right, which it also looks like this site has done.\r\n\r\nI'm really hoping
    for other opinions on this, even from Joe Clark."
