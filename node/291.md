    into an English text is doing the vowels &#40;nekudot&#41;, which are little dots
    under and over the letters. Only the special word processors can handle this.
    Israelis rarely use the nekudot.

  body: '&#62;OpenType GPOS positioning in MS Word.  <BR>Very interesting. Can you
    give me more information about Hebrew? <BR> <BR>I knew that as of Windows 2000
    you could use Hebrew MS Word, whereas before you had to have the special Hebrew
    Windows. I didn&#39;t mention this above as I believe Hebrew Word would be more
    expensive, and more than what Kyle needed.  <BR> <BR>I have been using DavkaWriter,
    but was looking for a better typeface than offered there. One does, I believe,
    need a Hebrew word processor, because of the right to left text, and expecially
    for the nikudot. Even Israelis regard putting in the nikudot as incredible hassle.
    Without a Hebrew word processor, I would think that it would be a nightmare. &#40;Teamim
    are a double nightmare, but there is only one book for which they are needed,
    the Chumash - the Torah and Haftarah with the vowel and chanting symbols - and
    of course the text is already available digitally set.&#41; <BR> <BR>I am doing
    a modern commentary &#40;in English&#41; on a classic Jewish text that I can get
    on CD rom, and I am also designing and setting the book &#40;to be published by
    a commercial house&#41;. Davkawriter, which I am now using, has their propriatary
    system, not compatible with others, but I believe the Israeli CD roms with my
    text will work wherever Hebrew Word works. I suspect Dagesh also has their own
    system. Will your new typeface, and regular fonts from Israel paste with nidudot
    correctly into Word?  <BR> <BR>I am also buying InDesign for the project. I noticed
    that there is also an InDesign ME &#40;middle east&#41; for Hebrew and Arabic.
    Will everything work OK for me pasting the Hebrew that goes into Word into regular
    Indesign, or do I need InDesign ME? Do I need an open type font, or will regular
    PS or TT fonts also work on pasting the nekudot properly? <BR> <BR>'

    keyboard drivers in any version of Windows 2000 or XP, and just start typing in
    any recent version of Office. You can also do quite a lot just with Wordpad. The
    only thing you would be lacking would be Hebrew dictionary support. MS have an
    Office &#39;Proofing Tools&#39; pack that includes Hebrew dictionary, sorting
    algorithm, as well as a whole pile of pretty good OT fonts from Gutmann in Israel.
    <BR> <BR>I have not used DakvaWriter. Is it Unicode? The really nice thing about
    the MS approach is that it is all Unicode, so the text is interchangeable with
    other applications and across platforms. <BR> <BR>If you want to do Hebrew typesetting,
    you need the ME version of InDesign. The regular version will not do right-to-left
    text, and it will not do GPOS mark positioning. [The current InDesign ME will
    support <i>nikud</i> positioning, but only clumsily handles <i>teamin</i>; I am
    corresponding with Winsoft, the makers of IDME, about this and hope to have it
    improved.] <BR> <BR>Regarding fonts, you really need OpenType if you want marks
    to be positioned really accurately. However, IDME has pretty decent algorithms
    for mark placement, so does a reasonably good job at &#39;blind positioning&#39;.

    <BR>I am wondering whether pasting from Word &#40;on Windows XP&#41; into regular
    InDesign will work as far as nekudot, or whether I have to have InDesign ME to
    position the nekudot correctly. I don&#39;t need to compose in InDesign, but I
    do need to include nekudot as my book is for Americans, and most who know some
    Hebrew need the vowels. Do you know about this? <BR> <BR>Right now I am pasting
    Hebrew from Davkawriter into PageMaker. Each line becomes a paragraph, and I force
    justify all of them, except the last line of the paragraph right justified. This
    works. Davka actually in the past year or so also got Guttmann fonts, so perhaps
    switching is not going to help me that much, for my purposes. But there was a
    font on one of Luc Devroye&#39;s links - &#39;Poeta&#39; - that I thought might
    work better with my design. Your design is nice - I gather it is designed to harmonize
    with matching Greek and Roman fonts - a feat! <BR> <BR>Dagesh and Davka writer
    are legacies of the time when regular Windows couldn&#39;t handle Hebrew. I believe
    they use little-used slots &#40;is that the right word?&#41; in the ascii table
    for the nekudot, and then somehow have programming to position them correctly.  <BR>
    <BR>However, I haven&#39;t heard about people in the US Jewish community who use
    these programs switching to just using Windows XP and Word. This could be because
    the dedicated English-Hebrew programs are designed to switch back and forth between
    languages easily, paste into Word etc. Also they have an on-screen Hebrew keyboard
    you can click with a mouse, so you don&#39;t need to know the Hebrew keyboard.
    Or maybe people just don&#39;t know about the new Windows options.  <BR> <BR>'

    oldstyle, and the Greek is related to the Clio Greek that I presented at ATypI
    in Rome -- and hence to the Granjon St Augustin Greek --, although that will be
    the italic and there will also be an upright version influenced by the later Dutch
    Greeks. Fun project.

    my smallcaps quite a bit taller than my x-height, presuming the height of the
    caps allows, because I so often end up designing Cyrillic alongside my Latin.
    Cyrillic smallcaps <i>need</i> to be noticeably taller than the lowercase x-height,

    x-height = Latin x-height unless I&#39;m making an Old Church Slavonic font. Like

    I dislike that very much - it violates linguistic realities. But really, even
    a preference for such cognates doesn&#39;t have to preclude making the vertical
    proportions different. You might say it&#39;s too much trouble scaling up the
    Latin cognates to a larger x-height, since you&#39;d have to then make them lighter
    too; but with a little bit of technique it could be a breeze - here&#39;s what
    I&#39;m thinking: <BR> <BR>If you have a weight axis in your font &#40;and one
    with a light extreme [sufficiently] beyond what you&#39;re actually releasing

    use, but use a slightly lighter weight to match the Latins. <BR> <BR>&#62; the
    developing norm for mixed modern Hebrew and Latin <BR>&#62; text is for the Hebrew
    to match the x-height of the Latin. <BR> <BR>Yes, I&#39;ve noticed - and it sucks.
    <BR>I wonder why there&#39;s been such a regression. I have to suspect an unhealthy
    infatuation with the West. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I guess what you&#39;re saying
    is that you&#39;re simply following established norms, in each script. Norms are
    important, but functionality itself even more so, no? I mean, if the contemporary
    Hebrew method were to become the norm, would you then start following it, even
    though you knew it skewed the apparent sizes? And if you admit that vertical proportions
    do affect functionality &#40;something the old Hebrew designers realized&#42;&#41;,
    then why not push Cyrillic towards that too? Do you fear you&#39;ll be blacklisted
    by the Russian font mafia or something? ;-&#41; Users don&#39;t even consciously

    <BR> <BR>John, I downloaded the trial version of InDesign, and tested pastes from
    the English-Hebrew word processor Davkawriter. It has dual export mechanisms -
    one to Hebrew programs and one to English programs. The export to English programs
    goes into regular InDesign fine - in fact better than into PageMaker. It makes
    each line a paragraph, and I guess reverses the order of storage. &#40;It also
    has a twin sets of Hebrew fonts for pastes into Hebrew and English programs.&#41;
    So I can get by with regular InDesign at this point. I&#39;m not sure, but I suspect
    that the reason people in the U.S. are still using Davkawriter and Dagesh, rather
    than Word with XP and a Hebrew keyboard installed is because of these kinds of

    if you want leading, you put in leads; the tradition has been to fill the type
    body as much as possible, although slight compromises were accepted when lining
    type was brought in.\r\n\r\nCyrillic is so similar to Latin, even having lowercase
    cognates as well as uppercase, that it would seem to make sense for the same typeface
    to have the same x-height in both scripts, even if the tendency had been for Cyrillic
    typefaces to tend to a larger x-height.\r\n\r\nOf course, an <em>opposite</em>
    approach would be to indeed use a larger x-height for Cyrillic, and use the glyphs
    from Latin <strong>small capitals</strong> for <em>their</em> cognates among Cyrillic
    lower case. I'm sure, though, that this would be regarded as even worse, and by
    a considerable margin.\r\n\r\nAs for Greek, it doesn't <em>have</em> lower-case

    not in the script reform business?\r\n\r\nOf course, it certainly is true that
    Greek has Phoenician roots, but then why not take Latin back to its Etruscan roots
    while you're at it?\r\n\r\nAs we've seen in the other thread on Greek typography,
    my attitude to Greek is that it missed the Carolingian boat, and so its upper-case
    looks like it belongs to the same great tradition as Latin and Cyrillic, and its
    lower-case is jarringly alien. But I also feel that trying to Latinize Greek is
    the wrong approach, and instead basically one has to leave it to the Greeks themselves
    to harmonize their upper-case and lower-case into a unified whole. Which may take
    centuries.\r\n\r\nNot that there's anything wrong, in the interim,  with designing
    typefaces which take new and original approaches to such an integration. Eventually,
    some features from some of those attempts may stand the test of time, and contribute
    to the ultimate resolution."
