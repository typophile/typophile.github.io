  thread</a> few days back but I didn't get enough feedback and now it seems that
  it has lost completely. Sorry for creating this another thread.\r\n\r\nSince last
  couple of weeks I have been working on the various weights of my typeface called
  Absans. At the moment Absans has 4 weights, i.e. Hairline, Regular, Bold and Ultra
  Black. I had never designed an Ultra black typeface before and also this was the
  first time I did a hairline version too. \r\n\r\nPlease have a look at the attached
  designs and let me know what you think. I really need your master feedback to carry
  this design furhter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in Advance\r\nSatya\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nice to see your typeface coming alive Satya :) It has a nice feeling I think.\r\n\r\nI
    saw a few things:\r\n\r\nW, w could be narrower, now they are like two V, v put
    together. Try to narrow the angle on them, I think that would be better. And perhaps
    also push the joining bottoms where the stems meet a little bit to the outside.
    This is mostly visible on light and regular.\r\nThe K, k \u2013 I prefer them
    as they are on the light weight and think you should have these design on all
    weights.\r\n\r\nThe B P R are related letters - but P and R looks differently
    at the top where the little stem is visible. Either B should also have this, or
    it could be removed.\r\n\r\nThe T looks a little bit to narrow compared to other
    letters. And the U a little to wide. Especially on the light and regular.\r\n\r\nThe
    S and s are leaning backwards a litte bit. Making them look shy.\r\n\r\ni and
    j has different stems on the top (the small angle) than other straight stems.
    I cant decide weater I think it's cool or disturbing :)\r\n\r\nFor me (maybe this
    is personal) the stress is on the \"wrong\" stem on V W X Y w v x y. I would shift
    it so the thickest stem is the first stem, opposite from what it is today. And
    also the A of course. I know Gill Sans has this \"feature\" also, but most fonts
    have the opposite I believe.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the T on regular \u2013 do
    you see that the horizontal stem is feeling thicker than the vertical? This could
    perhaps be something you could look into? Or not, if you want to have this feeling
    of a mathimatical thickness on the stems :)\r\n\r\nThe m could be a little narrower
    perhaps...\r\n\r\nWell, that's my two cents after a quick look.\r\n\r\nKeep up
    the good work!\r\n"

  body: "I would add that the g is distracting to me. I know it's meant to be the
    selling point on some level but I would reserve it for a display option. \r\n\r\nThe
    main issue I think you have is the interletter space and the counterspaces. What
    I see is thet the interletter space is too tight for the counter spaces.\r\n\r\nIn
    general you should be looking for the counterspaces and the interletter spaces
    to be similar. Noordzij & Brieim both make good cases for this. Here is briems'\r\nhttp://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.5a/2.3.5.02.method.htm\r\n\r\nYou
    can find Noorzij's even more in depth description in \"the Stroke\" Translated
    by Peter Enneson. \r\n\r\nThis may also be relevant. Think about which path you
    want to take where overall spacing is concerned. My sense is that you are falling
    outside of these ranges.\r\nhttp://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.5a/2.3.5.01.spacing.htm\r\n\r\nIf
    it was me I might consider shrinking the counters slightly. As well respacing.
    Not that you should choose either one. Just that they are both options.\r\n\r\nI
    hope this is helpful."

    this instance it is distracting to me as well.

    a bit too wide and the joins look a bit dark. it's nice :)

    it should. I am looking forward to seeing it get better. What do you think it
    should be for? That's important to know when giving the crit!

    time it shouldn't look ugly while in the displays. Can you please tell me the

    of the same face as Timothy suggested. What you have to say?\r\n\r\nSatya"

  body: I think you've got too much design going on for a nice text face. It maybe
    needs to be toned down a bit. Eg, the curving of the i, the bottom of the A and
    the g.

  body: "If you really want to do both well then it is indeed a good idea to have
    two versions as Tim said. Or maybe more. But I will get to that...\r\n\r\nYou
    may want to pick at text size you want to use as a standard/baseline and focus
    on getting the design optimized at that size. say 10 point... That would be a
    good start.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you could instead pick the smallest size you
    want to support and then interpolate between it and a medium size (16? ) design
    to make say 6, 8, 9, 10 , 12, 14, 16pt versions. But that might be overkill.\r\n\r\nTaking
    a look at what others have done may help you decide. Before you make size optimized
    versions you definitely want to settle some things about the core design. the
    g, w & so on. And definitely the interletter spacing. And actually the spacing
    is a size specific issue as well! All the more reason to pick a reference size.\r\n\r\nAfter
    you have selected a size to work on much of what you need to know can be figured
    out by making printouts at the relevant sizes & tweaking based on what you think
    could look better - eg trusting the eye. This should not be underestimated!!!\r\n\r\nBut
    you are correct also in thinking that there is a good body of work showing what
    to change when going from text to display.  Before you decide what you want to
    try to support it would be good to see how others have done it. For that I would
    look at John Downer's work on Paperback, Josha Darden's Freight series, and maybe
    search Typophile via Google. And there is Arno Pro as well.\r\n\r\nI found this:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/16839\r\n\r\nFrom
    the Typophile Wiki:\r\n<cite> Of special note is Sumner Stone's Cycles, which
    is one of the few modern examples of a font carefully crafted at each of the optical
    sizes. Monotype is also updating their library of classic fonts with some specific
    sizes, notably Bembo Book.</cite>\r\n\r\nI also know that Matthew Carter's designs
    for Newsweek are size specific. I can point you at a document that compares the
    outlines though. It's a great problem to dig into.\r\n\r\nMeta now comes in text
    & display versions. Look at them.\r\n\r\nAh, and I would definitely not insist
    on the g minus it's lower bowl for a text face. I would reserve that for a variant
    glyph in the display size.  \r\n\r\nI will see what else I come across this week
    re: optical compensation and post it here. I think the wiki could use updating
    too.\r\n\r\nI am sure that other folk here will also have even better suggestions
    than mine. \r\n"
