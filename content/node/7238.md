body: Has anyone figured out a good and practical way of using the oldstyle numerals
  in fonts like Adobe Garamond Pro etc., in MS Word? One can of course do a substitute
  routine when the document is finished, but it would be nice to be able to type them
  in directly. Any hints would be welcome.

  body: if the font has them then all you have to do is..Menu/Insert/Special and the
    font&#39;s glyphs that are mapped in Unicode show up and you click on them. On
    the Mac it might be the same... <BR> <BR>If the font doesn&#39;t have them or
    they are not in unicode you probably won&#39;t see them.

  body: Maybe use the MS Keyboard Creator &#39;MSKC&#39; to make a custom keyboard
    mapping number keys to the PUA positions of the OSN&#39;s - but I think there
    will be other problems like auto numbering of lists etc.,  <BR> <BR>Si

  body: The font has them, but since the oldstyle numerals are in the private use
    area &#40;for some reason - I can&#39;t understand why there isn&#39;t a regular
    unicode number for them...&#41;, they don&#39;t show up in the Insert/Special
    window. I can copy and insert them from the Fontmapper facility, but it is a bit
    cumbersome to do that every time I need a numeral...  <BR>I&#39;ll try the MSKC
    thing - I don&#39;t use auto numbering anyway. :-&#41;
