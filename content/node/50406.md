body: "I am starting the process of defining a brief for my type - in a bit of backwards
  way by making a survey of text faces I find attractive/pleasant.  Today I am looking
  at ( according to AF Johnson) something called Petit Romain Gros Oeil, number xix
  (16) and what do I find - another possible ra contextual feature/ligature. The book
  itself is a reproduction of the type specimens of Claude Lamesle. I don't have a
  date or really any decent info so I acn't get too excited about it. But it's interesting.
  According to the comentary at the front soem of the type dates from 1566 or so.
  So I would be completely surprised if the thing I am seeing is real. One thing is
  sure. I have a lot more looking to do this week!\r\n"
