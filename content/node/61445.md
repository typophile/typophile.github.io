  \"r\" and that discounts most of the usual suspects.\r\nThe closest I can get to
  it is a stylized version of Calisto MT, but I think there's something closer.\r\nSomething
  straight out of the box. Does anyone have a clue? Any closer than my pick\u2014three
  cheers to you!\r\nThanks \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_Cheerios_6372.jpg]"

  body: You probably won't find an exact match. Wordmarks like this usually have been
    customized from whatever font they started out with. The "r" may have been lopped
    off during the design process.

  body: Having said that Patty fab, it does like the 'r' carries on being used in
    the strapline beneath the wordmark... which would suggest its a font. But, whether
    or not its a custom font im not sure.

    but Pattyfab is right. Most of them are drawn or adapted.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: I'm pretty sure it's a custom font. They contacted me about doing one for
    them a couple of years ago, but nothing came of it. I assume they went with someone
    else. It looks more or less like what they wanted when they approached me about
    it.
