  body: "Matthieu \u2014 \r\n\r\nThree of the best published overviews of the lesser-known
    type designs of Dwiggins are:\r\n\r\n<cite>Postscripts on Dwiggins</cite>, Volume
    Two (Typophile Chap Book  No. 36), edited by Paul&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Bennett [New York:
    The Typophiles, 1960],\r\n\r\n<cite>Letters of Credit</cite> by Walter Tracy [Boston:
    David R. Godine, 1986], and \r\n\r\n<cite>American Proprietary Typefaces</cite>,
    edited by David Pankow [American Printing History Association, 1998].\r\n\r\nI
    believe the first two are out of print, and all may be difficult for you to find
    in France. But I thought I\u2019d let you know, so at least you know what to look
    for."

  body: "The <cite>Postscripts on Dwiggins</cite> are two chapbooks published together
    a few years after Dwiggins\u2019s death, as a tribute. They comprise several articles
    and remembrances from a number of his friends and colleagues on various aspects
    of his life and work. \r\n\r\nVolume One includes articles by Paul Hollister,
    Alfred A. Knopf, Mabel H. Dwiggins (WAD\u2019s widow), Carl Purington Rollins,
    Philip Hofer, and Helen Macy. There are also photographs of Dwiggins and selected
    reproductions of his graphic work.\r\n\r\nVolume Two includes articles by John
    Goss, Chester C. Lane, Margaret B. Evans, Watson M. Gordon, Dorothy Abbe, George
    Salter, Rudolph Ruzicka, and Paul A. Bennett. There is a selective checklist of
    his book design work.\r\n\r\nAnd \u2014 of most interest to this group \u2014
    the summary of his work with Mergenthaler Linotype and examples of [most of] the
    produced typefaces are found in Volume Two.\r\n\r\nAvailable copies of these books
    are often pricey. But the two volumes sometimes appear for sale separately, which
    is why I specifically singled out the second volume for this list, given the OP\u2019s
    expressed interest."
