body: "Have you ever wondered what happens when logos are translated to other languages?\r\nAfter
  moving back to Bangalore, I have been noticing how the company names are translated
  in local languages on neon signboards. Bangalore requires that the sign boards be
  displayed in kannada along with English. While the sign boards in English are well
  thought and designed, when they are translated to Kannada or Hindi they forget to
  carry forward the visual, specifically the type treatment of the original logo.
  Very few signboards redesign the structure, form, proportion and font metrics of
  the local script to match the original.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/barista_3786.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nEg:
  the below logo in Kannada just italicizes a common font in that language. It also
  misses the green leaf which is part of the logo. Ultimately, it is unable to visually
  translate the brand into the local language.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pizsign_4808.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  one forgets to carry the font weight of the original logo.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/levisign_4094.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nMany
  times, the translated logo, either in Kannada or Hindi seem to exist only to please
  the law enforcing authorities. So they are predominantly smaller in size and placed
  in a corner.\r\n\r\nThere are few logos which translate their visual identity very
  well. Below is one of my favorite.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ranga_5166.jpg]\r\n\r\nSome
  may argue since the main logo is in Kananda, a lot of thought might have been put
  to carry the type characteristics to English.\r\n\r\nHowever, most of the companies
  can also invest in finding or even creating new type in local languages which match
  the type of the original logo. It ultimately helps carry the brand to the local
  consumers.\r\n\r\nBut why does translating the type treatment matter? Simply because
  logos are a visual depiction of the brand. And the brand carries the company's vision
  and all that it stands for. Hence, it is imperative to have similar type treatments
  across various scripts.\r\n\r\n<em>p.s. The above comments are only limited to typography
  and have nothing against the company or brand</em>\r\n\r\n\r\nRead more articles

    bad at all, but compare it to the Sprite, Fanta, or Carlsburg. Ick!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Coca-Cola_logo3_6355.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/12_4430.jpg]\r\n\u2014Joel"

  body: "Joel, thanks for sharing these images. It's interesting to see logos in script
    which write from right to left!\r\n\r\nI like the way the font characterisitcs
    of the original Fanta logo have been carried in the translated logo. It doesn't
    seem like it's been written from right to left as the last 'a' in Fanta seems
    very similar to the first character. Same with 'D' in Diet.\r\n"

  body: "&emsp;The characteristics of the original have been kept, sure\u2014but at
    the expense of readability; the `a'-like &amp; `b'-like letters are hardly recognizable
    as the `pe' and `tet' that they're supposed to be.  Same with the Sprite logo:
    the `b'-like `tet' and the reversed-r `resh' are awful.\r\n&emsp;I suppose I was
    pointing out the complementary problem to your post:  Sometimes the structure,
    form, proportion, <em>etc</em>. of the translated logo is much <em>too</em> faithful
    to the original!\r\n\r\n\u2014Joel"

  body: "Yes, agree there should be a good balance between readability and retaining
    characteristics of the original logo. Being too faithful to the original at the
    cost of readability again will fail to translate the brand to the local customers.\r\nI
    feel when companies define brand guidelines, they need to take this into consideration. "

  body: "I think most people, especially those from the government, are confused with
    the difference between \"Logo mark\" and \"Logo type\".\r\n\r\n\"Logo Marks\"
    are basically graphic symbols which represent the identity of a brand or a company,
    while as \"Logo types\" consist of the names of the brand/companies. It becomes
    even more confusing where a brand doesn't have any \"Logo mark,\" instead just
    \"Logo type\" as their \"logo\". (example, Coca-cola and Levis, as we can see
    in the above images)\r\n\r\nIn many developing countries, people tend to think
    that since we recognize the name of a particular brand by \"reading\" it, therefore
    by just translating the name into a local language that is \"readable\" should
    be able to do the job. They have neglected, or just simply unaware of the importance
    of the visual representation of the brand.\r\n\r\nI find that in my country (Malaysia)
    it is very much so with most of the clients. It is then our job as designers to
    educate them.  I find that often times by introducing some simple terms helps
    a lot. (meanwhile trying to avoid being over \"jargonizing\") It certainly wouldn't
    help if people go around using a generic term like \"logo\" to refer to both the
    \"mark\" and the \"type\",  and worse still when designers don't even bother to
    take the effort to explain the terms to the clients.\r\n\r\nThe same goes with
    terms like \"brand\" or \"branding\". People talk so much about them but have
    no clue at all what they are referring to. Some would even use the term \"brand\"
    to refer to a \"logo\". You can imagine what happen when your client commissioned
    you to design a \"brand\" for them, while as what they actually mean is just a
    \"logo\".\r\n\r\nIt is also the responsibility of any international brand to develop
    a well designed identity manual which cover the communication needs of whatever
    country where their brand exists, and see to it that the guidelines are being
    followed by the locals. The purpose of a identity manual is to provide guidelines,
    in order to protect and to control the integrity of the visual identity. Again,
    the designer has an important role to play here to educate and inform the client
    of the need. A manual doesn't have to be complicated or expansive, but if a business
    is intended to expand to oversea, it's extremely crucial to develop such manual
    so to avoid any miscommunication arises when they cross cultures.\r\n\r\nI am
    currently involved in an identity project with a local client whom over the years
    expanded their business to at least another 4 countries or so, without any awareness
    of the need of any visual guideline in these countries. You can imagine the mess
    they got themselves into. To help them to design a system to cover these needs
    would mean a lot of extra works for me and not necessarily extra money, but I
    realize the hard work is extremely crucial for educating and setting a benchmark
    for the corporate world in long run.\r\n\r\nweng"
