  Kingdoms: Mesopotamia RPG by Necromancer Games, 2004. WhatTheFont didn't help. Any
  help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can recommend a similar font,
  that is a readable font with a bronze age/cuneiform feel to it, that would also
  help.\r\n\r\nThank you."

    consider Waters Titling or Trajan?\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/waters-titling-mm/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/trajan/"

    suggestions were a bit too Trajan and less stylized whereas this is more in the
    same vein but less constrained by the \"wall.\" The serifs may be a bit longer
    than you want.\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael"

    which, sadly, the suggested fonts seem to lack.\r\n\r\nThank you anyway!"
