  a Danish one-man foundry making alternative fonts and dingbats. They can be hard
  to use, the important thing is to never stop messing about with them.\r\nKenn\u2019s
  designs are usually based on an underlying system that allows the user to \u2018build\u2019
  words, or in the case of dingbats \u2014 images. This obsession is due to the hours
  and hours spent playing with LEGO bricks and model kits in his childhood. \r\nKenn
  Munk is also the designer of  \"Antlor - The Deer Departed\": http://www.antlor.net\r\n\r\nwebsite:
