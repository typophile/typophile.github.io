		<div class="commentbody">This is an interesting issue. As the buck stops here guy with Indie Fonts, I would like to chime in. I think partially due to my personal admiration of how MyFonts has treated us, I made a decision to allow MyFonts to distribute the Indie fonts books. The entire Indie Fonts project was intended as co-operative distribution vehicle. The individual showings of each font from the Indie Fonts CDs are simply specific details from the book. The purchaser is getting the same end product (a book and a CD) as if they bought it in a Barnes and Noble. There is no download of the Indie fonts on Myfonts or anywhere else. MyFonts is one of the many places people can buy Indie Fonts. I never imagined that anyone would have a problem getting more exposure for their foundry and type designs. Our agreement with each foundry was very basic yet very much concerned with promoting the foundries and not dictating how they distribute their fonts. One of the many goals of the Indie Fonts books was to facilitate exposure of the participants fonts to people who might not otherwise see them. I did not see the need to get permission from the 35 foundries included in the 2 books and dreaded the idea of another group emailing that only half of the participants would respond to. Yes it is  a bit odd to see the price of the end product when you are looking at the detail (see the P22 extras sampler on MyFonts and it's bargain price). Unfair competition?&hellip;I don</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Richard: <BR>But Union is responsible to its designers. If even one of them has a problem with the preview ability on MyFonts (even if I for one think it's great), then there's a mismatch between one agreement and another (in this case subsequent) one. It's really just a matter of miscommunicating details, so nobody should feel outraged. But if a given font designer can point to an original agreement that prevents previewing (or even if he can show he was tricked into a preview allowance) then the preview needs to be pulled, one way or another. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, forbidding plain <i>linking</i> (or even static renderings from legally-owned fonts) is not viable. <BR> <BR>Jim: <BR>If your site just says Emigre fonts exist (like MyFonts does with Adobe for example) then it's just dandy. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I also need to chime in here. I wanted to add to what Richard says about how we have been marketing the Indie Fonts books at MyFonts. <BR> <BR>Internally, we realized that while some customers will be turned on by the books, others will be more so by the accompanying CD. The disks themselves, each containing dozens of fonts, will certainly appear as great value to many customers - as long as they can examine the fonts. (Although the CD is not much marketed by others selling Indie Fonts, this was no reason to avoid such marketing. Those of you who saw last week's newsletter will have seen this is exactly how we marketed it to our customers.) <BR> <BR>To reply to Nick (&quot;it was easier to use their standard format, rather than prepare a special piece of artwork&quot;), I have to say I don't see the problem - if we have a technology that displays fonts in a manner that allows comparisons, then why would we not use it? Custom artwork and texts too, if there's time &amp; resources: so we added several photos of the books, wrote articles about the books from scratch, and posted links to reviews and more pictures. <BR> <BR>Having said all that, I realize we were probably remiss in not checking it was acceptable for customers to use Test Drive on all these fonts: we're now checking to see with the relevant foundries which preview mode they would like to use on their fonts. Also, in response to those who note that our presentation seemed to imply MyFonts had a direct relationship with certain foundries, we just added a paragraph to clarify sources: e.g. &quot;MyFonts.com sells HOTMETAL by agreement with P-Type Publications&quot;. Ralph notes this is still not ideal - we are working with Rich Kegler on this wording, and the mentions of font price. <BR> <BR>Some miscellaneous corrections from earlier in this thread. Yes, we do have a contract with Emigre to sell their fonts. To recorrect Hrant's self-correction, we *are* offering a font from Union Fonts (not for download), thanks to its presence on IF2 and our contract with P-Type. No, we don't sell Adobe fonts directly, but sell many Adobe fonts thanks to our contract with Linotype. <BR> <BR>BTW please contact me at lorp <em>at</em> myfonts.com if you want to write directly, or foundrysupport <em>at</em> myfonts.com for the whole team.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">MyFonts is a major distributor of mine, and like many foundries who were left in the lurch when Makambo folded, where would I be without them?  <BR> <BR>Sure, I'm critical of them occasionally  &ndash; they are always trying new stuff and don't always get it exactly right first time. And as a major presence that aspires to be an industry resource, rather more than just another distributor, they should expect a little more heat. <BR> <BR>In their defence, Jim, sure it could be mistakenly construed that they are a Union distributor, but they have taken immediate steps to lessen that impression, and they also have a link to your site &ndash; something that other distributors (eg Fonts.com, FontShop, Veer) do not provide online, even for their bona fide suppliers! <BR> <BR>Next up Laurence, can you fix the code so that it doesn't create grammar like &quot;an Union font&quot; or &quot;contains one fonts&quot;?  ;-) <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>
