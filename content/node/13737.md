body: "I've got to redraw a logo (attached), the vector art for which is lost or never
  existed, and it's not worth my time to redraw the type.\r\n\r\nI did my usual battery
  of research on this one, but I'm sure it's something so obvious I just went right
  past it. It's also possible it was a bundled font. I've checked out <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/carlos/familytree.html\">Carlos</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/newport-land/\">Newport Land</a>, <a
  href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/romeo/\">Romeo</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?5ZR\">Casablanca</a>.
  I've scrolled through 975 fonts on My Fonts after searching 'art deco condensed'.
  It's definitely coming from the same inspirational source as the others: Carlos
  Winkow's Electra from around 1940 (<a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Romeo\">according
  to Font Bureau</a>). However, every time I get close, some aspect is off. Few are
  condensed enough or thick enough. I wonder whether it's been modified by the previous
  designer, but I can't tell either way.\r\n\r\nSo, I turn to all of you."

    are for, I guess.

    name or category, it doesn't always display the weight variants.\r\n\r\nOn dafont.com
    there is a check box for \"show variants\". That's how I spoted the condensed
    versions of Casablanca.\r\n\r\n"
