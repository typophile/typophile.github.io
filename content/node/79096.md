  into a website.\r\n\r\nIn this case the printed materials would use Gotham Narrow
  as a body copy font. The question is, which is more like Gotham Narrow: Tahoma or
  Verdana, and why?\r\n\r\nI have adjusted size and tracking to get all three into
  the same basic space and configuration. Please forgive any little issues. \r\n\r\nI
  am eagerly awaiting interesting comparative notes. Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TypefaceComparison_6347.jpg]"

  body: I would say Tahoma. But I don't know how many non-Windows users will have
    it on their systems.

    Linux or mobile users you are expecting.\r\nMaybe in the end Verdana is the safer
    bet."

    exists, anyway.

  body: "Hmmm... perhaps Tahoma with a Verdana back up is the safest then. On the
    web Tahoma isn't used very commonly \u2013 probably for this reason \u2013 but
    that gives it a bit of an edge in uniqueness. "
