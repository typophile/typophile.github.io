  body: Well, I am sure I have seen them both in serif and sans serif faces. So, not
    sure what to tell you unless you can post an image in the type id section of the
    forum. <BR> <BR>Also, if you are looking for free fonts here you are in the wrong
    place. Most of the people here will tell you &#40;and rightly so&#41; that fonts
    are typically copyrighted material and you should pay for them unless the owner
    is giving it away for free. <BR> <BR>Anyway, post a sample and at least you can
    ID the font.

  body: thank you for your replies.  <BR> <BR>i wasn&#39;t aware that there were more
    than one species of font magnets!!! shows how long it&#39;s been since i last
    used them &#40;20 years?!?&#41;. <BR> <BR>the font i am looking for is VAG Rounded.
    <BR> <BR>just to say that i understand the value of copyright mike and no i am
    not looking for free fonts, only enquiring if this particular font WAS copyrighted.
    <BR> <BR>thanks again.

  body: VAG Rounded is a licenced font. Go to MyFonts and you will find it. If you
    need something simular try DaFont. You will have to hunt through the junk but
    maybe you can find something useful. Good luck NF
