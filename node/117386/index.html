  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don&rsquo;t think anyone has done a post on version 2.0 of this family. Apologies if someone has. But I just went and looked (and downloaded) the new version. I didn&rsquo;t check every weight, but WOW.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Which lead to my posting the following to the AAUP design list:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A few years ago, I posted about Lato, a SIL OFL (Open Font License) font. Sans serif, created by professionals, interesting story behind it. Not going to repeat it, it&rsquo;s too long. A number of people used it at that time, but it lacked small caps, old-style figures, and many of the the niceties.</p>
<p>Now, it seems version 2.0 is out.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.latofonts.com/">http://www.latofonts.com/</a></p>
<p>I only checked the medium weight, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Old style figures.
Polytonic Greek.
Cyrillic.
All the combining diacritics. Some of the combining diacritics supplements.
Full IPA phonetics, and some supplements.
All of Latin Extended A (European languages, including Central and Eastern Europe)
All of Latin Extended B (many African languages).
All of Latin Extended Additional (romanized Indic scripts, romanized Arabic, Vietnamese).
Much of Latin Extended C (never needed it, but it&rsquo;s there&hellip;)
Etc.</p>
<p>And not only in roman, but (at least medium) italic as well.</p>
<p>No small caps, outside those used in phonetics, but almost everything else one could wish for, all free, and free to use in print, digital, or web  publications.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Apache license offers only one thing over and above the OFL license: You can take a free-for-the-world product that has thousands of hours of donated time put in by someone else, add a few hours our your own time, and create a product you can sell. Of course you <em>could</em> also donate of your time and skills, but you do have the option of selling.</p>
<p>Fine as long as eventual buyers are not misled about (1) what they are getting and (2) their other options.</p>
<p>Two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mountains beyond Mountains<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (authored by Tracy Kidder, about the early life of the doctor Paul Farmer). This to counter your knee-jerk notion that only money adds value. But if you want to press on,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would seem you can also do something equivalent with (at least some) of the fonts from the X-consortium. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Charter">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Charter</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On that page, go to External Links and download</p>
<p>Bitstream Charter con­vert­ed into OTF, TTF and webfonts</p>
<p>Now, open, say, the roman and look at the copyright. You find</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>emphasis (in bold) added.</p>
<p>I would, were I you, check on what seems to be the legal permission in the above copyright. Maybe &ldquo;modification to OpenType&rdquo; would somehow exceed the permission, though I can&rsquo;t see how, in part because there was no OpenType in 1992.</p>
<p>Be advised that I plan to offer an expanded version of Charter (not Charis) as well, for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->free<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, after checking that above clause. For moral reasons, I also checked with Matthew. Mine is planned as a very extended version, but Latin alphabet only, no non-Latin, such as Armenian.</p>

<p>Agreed.
The ethical trump card in making money by modifying libre fonts is that people can always get a free alternative, if it exists (and it probably couldn&rsquo;t exist if making money were not [ethically] possible).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Never said that, never even thought it.
I rarely make minority fonts for money, I merely hope to reduce the losses from this labor of cultural love, mostly to lessen my material shortcoming in providing for my family of six.</p>
<p>My TypeCon talk will afford me 20 minutes to fully explain. Please come.</p>

<p>It should be possible to make up a library of mods that can be applied (by script, even) to a virgin font file when an order comes in; a bit like the new-car dealers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I know that people get paid to modify OFL fonts, and that&rsquo;s certainly encouraging, but it remains that the client does not own the results, and that&rsquo;s often a deal-breaker (or it causes the fee to drop like a rock). Also, the retail world is entirely excluded.</p>
<p>As for the &ldquo;formulaic&rdquo; approach you mention concerning the derivation of non-Latin fonts (assuming I understood that correctly) I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to do that while yielding high-quality results (and I&rsquo;ve never seen that done either). From my experience in making multi-script fonts I know that both the macro and micro decisions seem nearly impossible to automate.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What I was thinking is based on using TTX as storage format since it&rsquo;s text. Text allows easy use of diff/patch and change control, common as sand on Linux/Unix systems.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dump a virgin font to TTX. (fresh.ttx)</li>
<li>Make some changes, save the new font and dump it to TTX. (modded.ttx)</li>
<li>diff -u fresh.ttx modded.ttx &gt;changes.diff (changes.diff shows every difference between the two TTX files.)</li>
<li>patch -Np0 -i changes.diff (By now fresh.ttx and modded.ttx should be identical.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In theory, a process built on this should allow you to build a library or collection of modifications. In practice&hellip; there&rsquo;re always some differences between theory and practice.</p>
