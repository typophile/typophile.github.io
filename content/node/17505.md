  body: "The bouncing baseline (the i is raised) suggests this was either rub-down
    lettering or manually set display phototype. A quick check against the more popular
    Filmotype film fonts doesn't find a match. Certainly looks pre-digital.\r\n\r\nAny
    specific info on where this came from (North America or elsewhere) and how old
    it might be?\r\n"
