  alternatives on FontShop already but wondered if anyone knew of any others that
  might be worth a look. It also needs to compliment a logo created with Palatino.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions welcome...thank you!"

    tagged as "flared"</a> on MyFonts. Not everything there is relevant, but many
    are.

    Percepta]] by Letterhead Fonts for display. It has a similar look but more character.
    I'm delighted with it. It has five weights and alternates for $49! - but no italic.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LHF
    stevens-sample_4203.gif]\r\n\r\nThe kerning is extremely tight, I've had to increase

  body: And although it isn't flared, <a href="http://www.linotype.com/3201/palatinosans.html">Palatino
    Sans</a> has much of the same character as Optima. Perhaps it's even a bit more
    informal.

  body: "Optima can certainly complement Palatino, in a rather obvious manner, as
    you infer.\r\nThey have similar letter forms, and a similar degree of gloss representing
    the trace of process: the flaring and concave terminals in Optima, and the flexed
    serifs of Palatino. \r\n\r\nIf you are prepared to focus more on that surface
    element of style, rather than the letter proportions, you might consider faces
    such as <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/laudatio-bq/\">Laudatio</a>
    or my <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/brown.html\">Brown Gothic</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: The most beautiful Optima-ish looking typeface I've seen is the type created
    for the new <a href="http://www.melkeveien.no/portfolio/?pid=696&cat=portfolio">Statoil</a>
    logo, however, I'm not so sure its for sale. If its for a logo only, you might
    want to just customize Optima to your liking.
