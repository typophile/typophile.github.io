  body: "Note that although VOLT is described on the MS site as being used to add
    OTL tables to TTFs, it can also be used to add them to CFF fonts, although you
    can't visually edit features for CFF fonts directly in VOLT (because it has no
    PS rasteriser).\r\n\r\nSee my <a href=\"http://www.tiro.com/John/FontLab-to-VOLTworkflow.pdf\">FontLab-to-VOLT
    workflow documentation</a>."
