  body: "Yyy, for some reason, in FontLab 4.6, the global guides are controlled not
    by the guidelines layer but by some other layer, vertical metrics I think. I don\u2019t
    have 4.6 on the machine I\u2019m typing this so I was not able to check for sure.
    I knew it was one of the layers but not the guidelines layer, so I told you to
    unlock all just to make sure :D\r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
