body: "Recently Nick Shinn proposed [[http://typophile.com/node/101331|(here)]] a
  Greek version of MyFonts, in order to make Greek fonts better accessible for users
  of Greek. I found that a very interesting suggestion and asked John Collins of MF,
  if this vision could become reality.\r\nHe answered, I take the liberty to cite
  from his message: \u201Cwe have not been able to convince ourselves that the cost
  of making MyFonts available in any other languages would produce a reasonable return
  on the investment. If that changes, we will of course move in that direction.\u201D\r\nAs
  reasonable as this sounds, I still wonder if there could be a chance to see a hellenic
  MyFonts site come into life. Or perhaps, something similar to [[http://www.myfonts.de/|MyFonts.de]]
  which is a kind of MF digest journal adressing German readers.\r\nThere are currently
  over 200 fonts listed when the tag \u2018Greek\u2019 gets clicked. I believe they
  would sell more if they would be visible in a Greek language environment. It\u2019s
  not just for Greeks in Hellas or Cyprus but also for the many scholars in Greek
  studies worldwide.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, the same question arise for Cyrillic;
  maybe for other script systems as well in the future?"

    one that has an affluent population with low penetration of the languages you
    already know. So for example I'm sad to say that an Armenian version of MyFonts
    doesn't make sense in at least three ways: we don't spend a lot of money on fonts;
    we all know a second -major- language; and we almost all know a <em>third</em>
    language that's bigger than ours. :-)  And frankly a Greek version of MyFonts
    doesn't make a lot of sense to me either.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    an individual could set up a country specific type site fairly quickly at minimal
    initial cost and with some hard work may be able to make decent money.\r\n\r\nMay
    I suggest you treat the designers of type well? Say, 70% royalty rate?"
