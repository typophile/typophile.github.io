  this font? An interesting g, don't you think?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/herncliffe_6489.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd

  body: "Double mini roundabouts don't really work at all. They probably have a traffic
    calming effect\u2026 because everyone comes to a stop and wonders what to do.\r\n\r\nThe
    sign is a but of a curiosity though. Mini roundabouts (and especially double ones)
    are a comparatively modern phenomenon (<25years?)but\u2026 it looks like a much
    older style of sign but\u2026 the font looks like Transport, but it should have
    just one initial cap, the border thickness looks completely wrong and the diagram
    doesn't comply with the regulations either."

  body: "\r\nNo it's brilliant. If you want to go to Wroughton, you don't have to
    go all the way around a single large roundabout like Vauxhall or Hanger Lane.
    \r\n\r\nTo go to Wroughton you, signal Right at the first round-about, give way
    Right then signal Right again, give way Right again and you'll be laughing.\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you need to do a U-Turn you don't have to go all the way around just signal
    right and loop around the first round-about, it's Magic.\r\n\r\n"

    Seven Corners, in northern Virginia (about 10 miles due west of the White House).
    \ Now *that* is a mess!  And only 10 quid for the T-shirt....  ;-)\r\n\r\nRe:
    Belwe.  Yes, that lower-case \"g\" is certainly distinctive -- I had a client
    a number of years ago who wanted me to open up and extend the loop for their logo.
    \ The result doesn't look half-bad (should scout around for a copy of that logo
    and post it, I suppose), but it's definitely not \"classic\" Belwe.\r\n\r\nLinda"
