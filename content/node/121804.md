  of Phoenix. I'm a senior and pursuing a degree in graphic design with a minor in
  typography. I'm currently enrolled in a font design class and I just completed my
  typeface! I would love your personal and professional opinion. Please let me know
  what you like and what would make this typeface better. \r\n\r\nHydrogenic Sans\r\nBy:
  Jose Luis Ruvalcaba\r\n\r\nHydrogenic Sans is geometric typeface based on fractions
  of a square. This font is really just meant to be legible at any size on any type
  of platform. This typeface was meant for body copy but along the process of creating
  this typeface the purpose of this font changed to be used for display, wether it\u2019s
  used on a poster or on a billboard. A problem or issue that this font would be able
  to fix would have to be legibility issues. It can easily replace any other font
  to make something important legible.\r\n\r\nSomething fun and special about this
  typeface are the alternate letters. These alternates can be used to make a headline
  stand out. It also allows the user to mix and match between the regular and alternate
  alphabet to create unique words and phrases.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hydrogenicsans_6218.jpg]"

  body: It succeeds as a student exercise, but I must express some dismay to think
    that an instructor somewhere is probably encouraging, or requiring, these sets
    of arbitrarily mutated alternates that will be put to no purpose but <a href="http://experimentalsans.tumblr.com/">being
    made fun of on this page.</a>

  body: "Hi cerulean, I'm the professor that you feared required a particular style
    in my intro to type design course. :-) Sorry to burst your bubble, but no. Each
    student's work reflects their own particular interests in selecting a typographical
    design problem to wrestle with.\r\n\r\nYou might have noticed that about ten students
    have posted their projects this week. Thanks to all of you here at Typophile for
    your constructive feedback so far.\r\n\r\nLet me be clear: the objective was not
    to create a new paradigm of earth-shattering new font designs.  This is not a
    Masters level design course, it was an introduction to the entire font design
    process.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this assignment were to:\r\n\u2022 Create a
    design brief that proposed a solution to a typographical design problem.\r\n\u2022\_Learn
    the fundamentals of font construction including re-learning type anatomy from
    a new perspective, that of a creator not a consumer.\r\n\u2022 Examine and resolve
    issues of type color, letter pairings, metrics, ligatures and yes, the role of
    alternates or swashes and their placement in Type Tool\r\n\u2022 Learn FontLab's
    Type Tool program, including file setup, organization, metrics, font generation
    and installation.\r\n\u2022\_Design of a type specimen sheet that highlights the
    font features in their best light and sample collateral pieces that show an appropriate
    application of the font which speaks to the target demographic.\r\n\u2022 Solicitation
    of constructive criticism from a professional forum in order to improve aspects
    of their font.\r\n\r\nLooks like we've only half-succeeded on that last point
    in this thread on \"Hydrogenic Sans\" ;-) We got the criticism, but not much that
    was constructive. Personal distaste for and mockery of this style seems fairly
    irrelevant. \r\n\r\nWe're all learning here, and you're right cerulean, this was
    a student exercise that met the criteria for understanding the font design process.
    Anyone have anything constructive to add?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

  body: "Kevin\u2019s comment could be seen as a bit blunt, and perhaps not very articulate,
    but I don\u2019t think is\u2019s completely non-constructive: he points out that
    the alternates look arbitrary and directs to a place showcasing a good number
    of examples of the genre, including Paul Renner\u2019s early studies for Futura.
    In short, an useful resource to making oneself familiar with current trends and
    their historical antecedents.\r\nThat said, given that\r\n<blockquote><p>A problem
    or issue that this font would be able to fix would have to be legibility issues.
    It can easily replace any other font to make something important legible.</p></blockquote>\r\nI
    would need to see something typeset in it to be able to give some meaningful feedback."

  body: "Sorry if it was glib, but it was the only thing to remark on because I truly
    can't find any fault in the construction, execution, or presentation. As for my
    assumption, it was primed by having first seen <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/121588\">this
    classmate's entry</a>; I hope you can see why. I still feel you might ponder whether
    there is something about how you've set the task that steers students this way,
    perhaps by tacitly giving them the choice between doing twice the work (i.e. making
    a lowercase) and doing something like this.\r\n\r\nOn a second look, I do have
    a few constructive observations. Many of the numerals seem lighter than the appropriate
    weight, and the question mark particularly so. My highest praise is for the design
    of the ampersand."

  body: "Students were given a choice of designing a full uppercase and full lowercase
    plus basic punctuation. \r\nOR\r\nFull uppercase and 10 numerals, plus 16 glyphs
    (ligatures, alternates, or additional punctuation) and the same basic punctuation
    set.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot I'd do differently next time around, and eliminating
    this choice might be one of them. I enjoy offering choices in general but I feel
    those who stayed in a single case may have had an easier time than those who did
    both. I was concerned that cranking out both uppercase and lowercase in the 4
    weeks allotted might not have been enough time to develop anything of high quality.
    The estimated time spent on task, including all of the steps illustrated above
    which included rounds of sketches not mentioned, was 40 hours. \r\n\r\nResults
    were mixed in both quality and complexity, but nobody failed. This is the first
    step in an important journey of understanding just how deep and wide the subject
    is. Some students will try it again with even more resolve, and some will just
    be grateful it is over :-)"

  body: In my opinion, your concern is well-founded, and the students who bought themselves
    the time to pay attention to refining the outlines of one case probably learned
    the most. I suggest you give future students the choice of an uppercase alphabet
    or a lowercase alphabet, plus an equal amount of other characters, and specifically
    tell them not to try to do both until after the review is over. Harmony between
    the two cases can be an unexpectedly advanced thing, a powerful distraction from
    understanding basic skills.

  body: A single modular case with a little punctuation wast the first assignment
    given to them, in order to learn the ins and outs of Type Tool/Illustrator collaboration
    and the introductory principles of type design over 5 weeks. Most of what we're
    seeing here is their second font, a chance to take everything they learned the
    first time around and apply the new skills in a faster prototype without the software
    and process getting underfoot. Then the course ends. I'm not sure what's more
    important at this stage -- learning to refine characters of a single case better
    and being stuck with two single-case display-only alphabets at the end of the
    course or letting them give two cases a shot and learning just how amazingly different
    upper and lower case is. Its hard to say at this stage of development which path
    is <em>better.</em> Being a student-centered classroom I ultimately decided it
    was more important for the student to take a degree of ownership over the direction
    of their own learning. Students were given a choice the second time around, and
    each got a taste of what they wanted to learn, with the obvious outcome that there
    is so much more to learn regardless of the path they took. They are responsible
    for critiquing and helping each other refine their fonts every week some much
    of the learning of the struggles of what the other track is doing is served through
    observation and application. Often <em>what's best</em> in sequencing can only
    be judged by what's best for that particular student.
