  okay, forget the argument about how such things might hinder readability for their
  lack of differentiation from the body text matter.\r\n\r\nNow how exactly can you
  make them in InDesign or a page layout program? Because, rather ironically, I've
  had more success achieving them in MS Word."

  body: "Or a plus and minus left indent setting on style sheets/format. For example,
    if the bullet was to hang 2mm outside the left margin of the body text, all body
    text would be indented 2mm while bullet text would be lefthand indent 2mm, first
    line indent -2mm. With numerals (especially those that go above 10) you might
    want to include a right aligning tab so that they all align on the righthand side.\r\nThis
    will mean that your text box should start 2mm before your lefthand margin and
    be 2mm wider than your measure.\r\nFor shorter pieces of text (or for working
    out your layout) the indent to here character would solve the problem too.\r\nTim\r\n{edit
    I should have added that you will need to set the bullet as this \u2013 bullet_tab_copy
    or in the case of right aligning numeral \u2013 tab_numeral_tab_copy}"

  body: "there is actually a \"cheat\" to this also.\r\nit is not recommended for
    longer texts but it can come in handy at times. (I use it mostly to correct the
    left hand positioning of two lines of headlines when big capitals seem to have
    a bad vertical alignment.) \r\n\r\nbefore your hanging indent numeral or bullet,
    type a [space],\r\nthen assign a massive negative tracking to that space (i.e.
    -1000)\r\nand the numeral/bullet will indeed hang from the left hand side of your
    text frame.\r\ncopy/paste this character ([space]) as neccessary.\r\n\r\nbest

  body: "Ah,\r\n\r\nSo, unlike the hanging punctuation, there really is no \"fair\"
    way to make the bullet sit outside the text box.\r\n\r\nThe \"indent to here\"
    button I knew. Negative tracking is quite handy.\r\n\r\nl'd still be mighty curious
    if someone here could find a more elegant solution to this problem."
