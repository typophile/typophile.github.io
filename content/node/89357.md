body: Does anyone know what this font is? I found it in Yoko Ono's Grapefruit book.
  Not the best image in the world but hopefully enough for a rough ID. Many thanks
  in advance. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/6a00e0098c410188330148c71853d8970c-450wi_6419.jpeg]

  body: Which edition is this from? What year? Might help narrow it down. I think
    it's a lovely typeface and none of the usual geometric slabs seem to match.

    different editions of the book seem to use the same typeface, only the weight
    seems to have changed.\r\n\r\n"
