  body: "Hi Rodrigo, Welcome to Typophile. It has been my experience that you get
    more feedback if you use your real name as your screen name. It used to be somewhat
    of a convention.\r\n\r\nAlso, good design is based upon informed decisions. Not
    shooting from the hip. Just think of the phrase \"to do something by design, as
    opposed to by accident.\u201D To help the group, can you tell us a bit about the
    context? Goals? Audience &c? Without this, people will only be able to provide
    you with subjective aesthetic feedback.\r\n\r\n(and you might want to avoid bumping
    posts in the future)"

  body: "Chris, the guy is just looking for an ID. And do you really think the people
    who ID fonts here are avoiding him because he only shows his real name in his
    profile and not his screen name (which BTW was never a convention as far as I've
    seen)? Some people don't even use their real/full name anywhere and they get plenty
    of help:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/100691\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/100685\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/100663
    (\"gio181\", \"john smith\", really?!)\r\n\r\nUsing a real name in the full profile
    is a great idea, but to me -and I think most people- the screen name is supposed
    to be more compact, and an opportunity for personal expression. I think there
    are more pressing ways to raise standards around here.\r\n\r\nRodrigo, you're
    not doing anything wrong, don't worry. When people don't know what font it is
    (and this actually doesn't even look like it might be a font) they don't say \"I
    don't know\". Sometimes nothing comes up - don't be too discouraged.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "@hrant: I speak from experience. A real name as a screen name did make a
    significant difference. I was asked to do so by older members, and say the same
    conversation on numerous occasions. From moderators. You were there, I\u2019m
    surprised you don\u2019t remember. The logic \u2014 to my understanding \u2014
    behind using a real name as a screen name was essentially to make you look a little
    more professional, grown-up, less goofy, pick a word. Imagine walking into a room
    full of strangers and introducing yourself by your nickname \u201CSkippy\u201D
    when your real name is Thomas. A first impression thing.\r\n\r\nAs far as compact
    goes, that\u2019s moot. It does not appear in the body of the thread.\r\n\r\nFor
    \u201Cmore pressing ways to raise standards around here\u201D please do email
    your suggestions to the appropriate persons. I\u2019d be more than happy to put
    them on my list. We\u2019re always looking for feedback on how to make Typophile
    a better place. From new and old members alike.\r\n\r\nAnd we all know how you
    feel about the ID board. I shudder to think how you\u2019d react if the majority
    of people started bumping posts that didn\u2019t get responses. If anything, my
    initial response was motivated to protect Rodrigo from your wrath. I stand (ironically)
    corrected!\r\n\r\nLong/short, just some advice. I meant no ill will. Carry on."

  body: "I think you're discouraging Rodrigo from ever posting again. For one thing
    thinking that he was asking for a design critique doesn't cast Typophile in a
    great light... Neither does making it sound too officious; call me crazy but I
    don't think most members are really seeing this place as some sort of job fair...\r\n\r\nConcerning
    the effect of using a real name as a screen name (or really, even just in the
    profile) I would bet real money that a statistical analysis would only reveal
    a statistically insignificant effect. I'm talking specifically about the ID section,
    mind you. You could also ask Ryuk, Dick and the other ID experts if they mind
    the lack of real names. If they don't say anything here/now, it's probably simply
    because it has nothing to do with IDing a particular font. Not everybody likes
    discourse, which is totally OK, as long as they don't mind others doing it:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/99822#comment-543380\r\n\r\nThe
    reason I don't remember people pressuring you to use your real name in your screen
    name is probably because it was pointless of them. And the people who disagreed
    with them probably just stayed quiet. BTW, I'm guessing that incident was not
    in the ID section... I hope you realize how different the ID section is compared
    to the rest of Typophile (which is normal).\r\n\r\nAlso, compactness is not at
    all moot, when you consider that people type each other's screen names when addressing
    them. BTW a signature can also be useful in that respect, because it's more visible
    than the screen name (especially at the end of reading a post) and is often shorter
    (like \"hhp\").\r\n\r\nBTW, I assume you're going to send a message to gio181?
    Or is the plan to only go after people who are already not having any luck here?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>my
    initial response was motivated to protect Rodrigo from your wrath.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat's
    an offensive -and confused- thing to say.\r\n\r\nI have never minded people asking
    for an ID - it's an entirely acceptable thing to do; and bumping a thread is totally
    OK as well - I don't think it's helpful to get on Rodrigo's case for that. In
    fact I (along with people like Stephen and Yves, who have now withdrawn 99% -
    ask yourself why) used to help ID fonts in the past, in fact much faster* and
    without acting as a proxy human robot to some canned IDing software. I've even
    said Typophile <em>should</em> have an ID board (to avoid IDs being posted in
    incorrect areas). The thing I mind -and I am not alone, I simply haven't given
    up on you yet- is the anti-designer attitude among a tiny minority of people who
    provide IDs (and I've even stopped confronting them). Fix <em>that</em> instead
    of fussing over cosmetic tweaks and you'll be helping Typophile for real.\r\n\r\n*
    http://www.typophile.com/node/14480\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/10588\r\n\r\nThere
    is a disturbing lack of observation skills here.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thank you everyone for the welcome and your answers - I initially thought
    it was a custom design too, but since I've seen other fonts with similar handwritten
    style I wanted to be sure if there was one out there before recreating it myself.\r\n\r\nI
    will wait a bit more if someone can identify a similar full fledged font for this,
    otherwise I'm vectorizing it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I'm not sure what my username
    has anything to do with getting a proper answer (or not) since most users here
    have nicknames. I thought the \"Full name\" field in each user's profile fulfilled
    that very same purpose.\r\n\r\nNot sure what you really meant in your second paragraph
    either, Chris. I'm not asking for feedback on the logo, why would I? This is a
    topic requesting font identification in the TypeID board (crazy I know) for a
    client who requested me to redesign it. I know very well where to post if I ever
    wanted to get feedback.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, thank you for the advise regarding bumped
    posts."

    Dean comes off, intentionally or not, as officious and pompous.\r\n\r\nSometimes
    bumping a post is like repeatedly pressing a doorbell if someone doesn't answer
    soon enough. Also, if a post has zero replies, it's obvious there is no answer.
    Some might assume a  post with several replies, all bumps, might already have
    been answered.\r\n\r\n<strong>Chris:</strong> <em>\"my initial response was motivated

    And, yes, it is offensive.\r\n \r\n<em>\"can you tell us a bit about the context?
    Goals? Audience &c?\"</em>\r\nWhat the hell does that have to do with an ID?\r\n\r\n<em>\"please
