body: "Does anyone recognize the typeface used in the titles for the new Robin Hood?
  While I know that designers of titles and credits for the movies will often create
  their own, I'm quite sure I've seen this one before.\r\n\r\nOnly caps and small
  caps are used. One of the variant forms includes a capital R with an exceptionally
  long leg, which sometimes forces a smaller version of the letter following it; and
  inside the O is a dot, which to my eye looks diamond-shaped. So I thought of Adobe
  Jensen, which uses diamonds in its dotted punctuation marks, and the D and the H
  are similar, though in the titles the H looks taller, narrower. And there are no
  variations of the R or O that have those special features. In the closing credits,
  I also noticed a variant M, in which the three legs were roughly parallel but the
  tops were rounded, and sloped downward to the right -- a distinctly medieval form,
  though it wasn't used frequently in the credits.\r\n\r\nThere are illuminations
  in some of the bowls, though I assume this was done by hand rather than it being
  a regular feature of the font.\r\n\r\nI've attached a screen grab of the title,
  but couldn't find any photos of the credits, where most of the variation took place.
  Does it look familiar to anyone?"

  body: "I have been spending some time searching antique serifs and found one font
    with center diamond-ish marks (<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typefetish/brogue/\">Brogue</a>),
    but almost nothing else about it seems even similar. The font <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/glc/1592-glc-garamond/\">1592
    GLC Garamond</a> seems to have a similar overall feel, except for the diamonds.
    It seems the R could be made using one of the Q tails, but I think it's not too
    likely we will find the exact font, because I have a feeling that they mixed and
    matched from several fonts and then customized with noise, squooshing and antiquing
    tricks.\r\n\r\nUsually when I get nowhere at the commercial sites, I check Dafont
    to see what the amateurs have done, and found a remarkable bargain (how can you
    beat free?) by Igino Marini called <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/im-fell-types.font?nb_ppp=50&text=ROBIN+HOOD\">IM
    Fell Types</a>, a 16-font family based on old English typeforms. There seems to
    be about 3 or 4 basic typefaces and at least one or two include SC versions. This
    ought to have enough variants to work with.\r\n\r\nBottom line: I don't think
    this is a single font that you'll be able to find, because I think it was cobbled
    together for this purpose. If you just want to make something that looks similar,
    that should be easy enough.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    from mason, then customised throughout with diamonds in the o's extending the
    r etc, in particular a custom ligature for every combination of letter involving
    an r. the typeface on screen was hand painted, then flourishes were added by hand.\r\n\r\n"
