body: "Hi-\r\n\r\nThe Church of Finland commissioned me to make this family. Two of
  my old students re-branded the institution, and since there are so many independent
  parishes with their own graphic look, Kalle and Anssi thought it was best to do
  the make-over with typography.\r\nThey used Carter Sans for their initial presentation,
  and when it was accepted, they contacted me to make the Martti family.\r\nI took
  some time to study the Carter Sans and Albertus, and their pre-Roman origin, and
  in the end I decided to just use the triangle shape serifs, and keep the basic design
  more modern, and since Martti is a display font, I kept the forms fairly narrow.
  I am currently making a wider variants for text setting.\r\n"

  body: "It is great, I really enjoy looking at it. My only concern would be that
    it might look too contemporary for a Religious institution, especially with that
    \"g\".\r\n\r\nBut this is a speculation at best, I know nothing about that particular
    institution.\r\n\r\n"

    the [&], the [\xDF], or the ascending stem of [p] in the italics. Overall congrats!"

  body: "So I've been comparing this to Carter Sans, and am having a surprisingly
    hard time deciding if it's too close; usually I'm quite decisive about these things
    (often ending up with a more lenient opinion than many others). It's tantalizingly
    close to my personal threshold of tolerance, challenging me to better define it.
    So I'm curious what others think (and what elaborations Tomi, who's graciously
    not hiding Martti's origins, might provide). I'm personally interested neither
    in berserker protectionism nor an \"anything goes, dude\" attitude, but I <em>am</em>
    highly interested in smart and sensitive analyses.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Well, I can just say that while both Albertus and Carter sans feel rough-hewn
    and glyphic to me (lots of sharp corners (and cut-and-corner solutions in the
    latter), low contrast, relatively dark), this font made me associate rather more
    to the sort of semi-calligraphic display lettering [[http://www.puh.nu/listor/bocker/z/images/16986f.jpg|frequently]]
    [[http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/jvr/LVK_html/jpg/aw_nobel.jpg|seen]] in sophisticated
    Scandinavian graphic design from the twenties to the seventies, precisely the
    sort of look in fact that evokes "church" to us nordics. I would say that even
    more clearly than Carter sans, Martti marries these vague feelings with lettershapes
    of a conteporary dutch serif. It works better than with Carter sans (which I don't
    like, however well-crafted) because there's a shared chirographic DNA that binds
    them together.
