  body: "Thanks for the ID Renko. That's one more for the Script Guide, and it led
    me to look for more of <a href=\"http://www.astigmatic.com/\">'Professor' Bonislawsky's</a>
    creations to add to the Guide. (I already had at least 6 or 7, but I can see I
    had more to collect). \r\n\r\nHis site is a fun place, and nicely done, if you
    haven't seen it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
