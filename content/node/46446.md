body: "Hello, I have recently been reworking Kabel.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is
  that I never liked the cuts in the terminals, which put me off using it quite alot.
  Which is a shame as it's such a nice font.\r\nOnce I had leveled out all the angled
  terminals I began to see other things that I wanted to change aswell.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I have included my work to date so please give me some critique on it!\r\n\r\nHenry.\r\n\r\nhttp://img169.imageshack.us/img169/6259/cribsheeted6.jpg"

  body: "I love Kabel, and would agree that a reworking with some of the more quaint
    or mannered idosyncracies would benefit.\r\n\r\nWhild I love the W, i dont like
    the low cross bars on the E F H, and the short terminla on the j, the unusual
    g, and thet tall ascender of the t.\r\n\r\nThe slanted bar on the e is important,
    but i wonder if the angle could be reduced and the balance of the letter improved
    greatly."
