      Is that what's being asked, or are you just looking for some online courses

  body: Ph. D. programs, where are those at. I am about to graduate with my BA in
    Design, and am currently researching grad schools. Mostly, I have heard and found
    that Reading is a good school, as well as the HBG, although thats almost impossible
    to get into. Any other suggestions? I dont mind relocating to a different country,
    i would prefer it actually, for the experience.
