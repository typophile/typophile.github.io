  body: "LOL. How about that? I didn't know it would be that simple, I thought I had
    photocopied from some rare esoteric manuscript!\r\n\r\nHmm....\r\n\r\nActually
    the bottom right ornament with the hanging double leaf is not in the Minion characterset
    so I wonder of the origin before adopted by Minion.\r\n\r\nYou don't get off that
    easy!"

  body: "I am surprised @Renko you are satisfied that it is there because of a buggy
    white space?\r\n\r\nThe last form is not in Minion Pro which suggests I have stumbled
    across the source for these. If everyone is satisfied in just identifying the
    font [x] [MinionPro] that uses all but one of the forms above - that's OK [well
    done], but I also am interested in what the actual source is without having to
    actually ask Robert Slimbach directly. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/floral2_4423.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/minion_4873.png]"
