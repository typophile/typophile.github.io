body: Our company would love to be able to have a digitized version of the script
  font used in our logo.  Can someone please ID it?  Anybody&#39;s help would be much
  appreciated.  Thanks.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64913.jpg"

  body: The script is handwritten &#40;for example look at the different &#34;e&#34;s&#41;,
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/brody/brody/testdrive.html?s=Yakima+Federal+Savings&amp;p=60"

  body: Jon, what is the age of the sample. Jan would be right if its a digitalized
    sample but if its pre digital it could just be a bad photostat. I have a feeling
    this is many generations removed from the original

  body: Dan, definitely pre digital.  We are guessing this logo is from the 1950&#39;s.  And
    I think you&#39;re right about it being a bad photostat.  Brody and Brophy are
    close, I just need the loop on the Y and g.

  body: Since this is pre-digital, I started scanning the Photo-Lettering catalogs
    and there are scores of brush scripts with every degree of thickness, slope, and
    letter styles. Those of you with Solotype Catalogs can see a small sample of these
    in pages 104-106. The names are not the same as in the P-L books, but the lettering
    sure is. Some like Hostess Script or Hemlock Script &#40;Solotype names&#41; are
    pretty similar looking, but we can&#39;t see enough letters. <BR> <BR>I guess
    my point is that I think you are looking for something that probably doesn&#39;t
    exist in the digital font world &#40;yet&#41;. Now that House owns the Photo-Lettering
    collection there&#39;s a chance they will digitize some of these 50&#39;s-era
    workhorses. Which reminds me House has a few fonts like this in their current
    <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=SIGN-FO&amp;sub=view" target="_blank">Sign
    Painter</a> collection.
