  Quark users have come to love the opt-shift and click shortcut to quickly apply
  a paragraph style from one paragraph to another (if you haven't you can have that
  one for free). I need to know if an equivalent exists in InDesign or am I destined

  a list of style sheets longer than the screen?\r\n\r\nAny help very gratefully received

    what I do know is that you can set up your InDesign preferences to use QuarkXPress
    shortcuts, so that would be my first step. Good luck!"

  body: Sorry to hear that, Robert... I'm pretty sure that it's an "official" shortcut
    in Quark, or at least a documented one, because I first picked it up from a book
    about the program... But I know what you mean. And there are other Quark shortcuts
    that InDesign does not use in that mode either.

  body: What a shame that Quark let their market slip away like they did. For many
    years, they set the standard, but now InDesign is not only gaining, but I'd guess
    has surpassed Quark in usage. Especially since InDesign comes bundled with CS2
    (and CS3). It's beyond me, though, why Adobe still insists on organizing the menus
    and shortcuts so differently between InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop.

  body: "Hi Robert. Contrary to what Ricardo says above I believe it was an undocumented,
    unofficial shortcut that came about in v.2 or v.3 of QX, and I remember reading
    about it in a trade mag (possibly the UK issue of MacWorld) rather than any Quark
    documentation. I never really had any call to use it because my production background
    meant that I usually assign keyboard shortcuts to stylesheets anyway... however
    I'm currently baffled because I can't get this feature to work in QX 6.5 at all.
    Can anyone confirm that it has been discontinued? And what version of QX are you
    using? \r\n\r\nAs Chuck says, InDesign has the eyedropper tool just like Illustrator;
    it has preferences (double click to ensure that the Paragraph Settings is checked),
    and it is contextual upon how (item, content, text) the target paragraph has been
    selected, although the paragraph styling will transfer if the text cursor is simply
    positioned within the target paragraph, much like that 'ol QX shortcut. "

    possible :oS)\r\n\r\nUsing the eyedropper tool does seem to have the desired effect.
    It seems a little more fussy than the Quark way of doing things but I'm sure there
    are plenty of people who want - and need - this flexibility. I can now march onwards
    with my cobbled together typesetting . My only grumble is that I still need to
    click in the toolbar to activate the function; as Adobe haven't used the option-shift
    and click combo for anything else couldn't they have thrown it in anyway.\r\n\r\nBen.
    I was using QX 6.5 and the shortcut functioned fine for me. I'm not aware of any
    extensions I had enabled.\r\n\r\nOnce again, thanks for the help guys.\r\n\r\nHappy

  body: "I can't figure out the eyedropper thing either. I miss that shortcut terribly,
    use it all the time in Quark. And if you're going to have to go click in the toolbar
    then you might as well just apply the style sheet. The QX shortcut was designed
    to enable you to work fluidly within the doc without needing to move the cursor
    over to a palette.\r\n\r\nI guess keyboard shortcuts for style sheets might be
    the way to go here. I never used them in Quark because I liked their own keyboard
    shortcuts (turning on and off the grid for example) but since I don't use InDy's
    keyboard shortcuts - in fact don't even know them - this might be something to
    look into."

    a specific page? In Quark it's command+J then you type in the page number. Much
    easier than scrolling thru the pages panel.

  body: I use the eyedropper tool all the time, and find it very useful. The only
    problem is that you have to be quite careful when sampling, sometimes a wrong
    attribute is copied. I also like the fact that once you've got the sample in the
    dropper for text attributes, you can paint different  texts with it (for example
    if there are several single words that need fixing).

    InDCS2 is pretty nice when right-clicking a paragraph style and choosing use this
    style then next style (and everything just gets the right style, if you built
    all styles on top of each other that is). And this connected to nested styles...

    me about InDesign is the fact that when I jump to a spread (either on the pages
    palette or now that I know, using command+J) the spread shows up shifted way to
    the right in the window, with a vast empty area to the left of my verso. I can't
    see the full spread without scrolling it over to the left. And then all the palettes
    clustered and seemingly rooted on the right. Anybody else have this problem? Know

    But still, that's a whole extra step. And if I hit command-0 (fit in window) it
    shifts the spread to the right again - centering the page in the window I suppose.\r\n\r\nI'm
    guessing the default for InDesign is to position the page in the center of the
    window. Which is fine if you're working in single pages but a huge pain if you're
    working in spreads and click on a verso. I'm going to look into Preferences and
    see if there's an override that would place the page at the left rather than at
    the center. Probably not."
