body: Just got underway on this new serif and am wondering what you think of it so
  far. The part I both like and dislike is the contrasting curved and straight stems.
  Sometimes when I look at it I feel like it&#39;s been through the wavy filter in
  photoshop, other times it seems fresh. Does this show promise? If so, I&#39;m bound
  and determined to get through UC, LC and Numerals without stalling out! <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: Randy. Can you set some of this smaller? I&#39;d be interested to see how
    the little details react under that.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Right, here is a smaller setting. Had to do a few more characters too. Much
    smaller than this, and the gif will kill any of the details anyways. Setting in
    illustrator, sorry about the spacing. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Randy<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/8940.gif"

  body: Ha, I like your &#34;subtle approach&#34;, randy. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR><i>&#62;The
    part I both like and dislike is the contrasting  <BR>&#62;curved and straight
    stems. Sometimes when I look <BR>&#62;at it I feel like it&#39;s been through
    the wavy filter in <BR>&#62;photoshop, other times it seems fresh. </i> <BR> <BR>I
    feel the same way. So, imho, I think you can give up  <BR>the curve strokes. It
    seems to be disturbing, more  <BR>than improving it. <BR> <BR>Btw, the &#34;f&#34;
    is nice. But the bowls in &#34;a&#34;, &#34;b&#34; and &#34;d&#34; <BR>looks a
    little strange. You&#39;ll probably be able to polish <BR>these characters later
    on Fog or FL. <BR> <BR>And I think &#34;n&#34; and &#34;m&#34; should have similar
    serifs. <BR>The &#34;n&#34;, without the inner footserif on the left vertical  <BR>stroke,
    seems disturbing to me. <BR> <BR>

  body: There could be something to a &#34;relaxed&#34; hand-written typeface, but
    I&#39;m not sure you&#39;ve &#34;relaxed&#34; in the right spots. For instance,
    your &#34;y&#34; I like, the middle stroke on your &#34;m&#34; just looks like
    a mistake. Although, all-in-all a lot of it disappears when it becomes smaller.
    Your serifs also seem a bit large.

  body: 'He he, a little bait is all it takes. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s some background.
    I wanted somthing with fat serifs. In fact, I wanted the serifs to be so fat that
    they were equal to the thin weight of modulation. That would pretty much make
    it a slab serif right? But with rounded slabs. The first character was the h.
    That&#39;s where curve/staight came in and I kinda liked it.  <BR> <BR>Eduardo:
    <BR>I&#39;m not totally ready to give up on the curves yet. But it is proving
    odd to solve characters with bowls as you pointed out. a, b, d. What do you think
    of the e? Is the weirdness coming from an inconsistent angle of modulation or
    from the nature of curvy and straight in one character. BTW, I like the f also,
    particularly the crossbar. Side question: how would i be able to polish the curves
    in Fontographer better than I could in Illustrator &#40;I have Fontographer, but
    have never really used it&#41;. <BR> <BR>Tiffany: <BR>My wife also thinks I haven&#39;t
    &#34;relaxed in the right spots.&#34; Too much around the middle apparently. Seperate
    issue, sorry. I believeour own Aaron Sittig put it right on his March type review:
    <BR> <BR><i> I couldn&#39;t figure out why text set in Sonoma  <BR>looked so much
    better at size 9. Now I realize  <BR>that size 9 will hide a whole host of problems  <BR>in
    any font. </i> <BR> <BR>Do the serifs seem large in thickness, ie too slabby,
    or too long? I&#39;ve steadily shortened them as i&#39;ve done more and more settings
    because of spacing issues. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the thoughts. Any preference on
    g&#39;s? <BR>More please. <BR> <BR>Randy'

  body: Well, I&#39;m not used to work in Illustrator, but I&#39;m guessing it doesn&#39;t
    have <BR>the BCP control ability that Fog has. And, I think the &#34;weirdness&#34;
    in your <BR>bowls can be easily solved by optimizing your BCPs in Fog. Try using
    the  <BR>Element&#62;Info command &#40;Ctrl&#43;I for Windows&#41;. <BR> <BR>In
    &#34;a&#34;, your bowl is too &#34;square&#34;. The &#34;e&#34;, I think it is
    a little wide. <BR>The fat serifs, I think are nice.
