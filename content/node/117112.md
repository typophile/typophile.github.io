    _G_, _W_ has vertex that goes to top not half way etc. Trump Soft Pro http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/trump-soft-pro/
    \ is closer but is still not a match.\r\nAnother similar Van Condensed Light http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rsantos/van-condensed/\r\nDon\r\nMight
    be a Westjet corporate font.\r\nDon\r\n"

    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAiXnVjNrYY\r\nMakes me wonder if this is actually
    a font or animated artwork.\r\nHowever, if a font exists it would be interesting
    to see some more letters.\r\nWestJet makes a big splash about how it listens to
    its customers. I wonder how they would respond to a request asking how the video
    was made? Perhaps the video maker would be happy to share information on the font
    used, or the fact that it was not a font, with a curious viewer.\r\nDon"

    the vertex on _W_ by narrowing the letter, lower the center stroke on E and tinker
    with the _S_ and you have a pretty good match. Even has the same rounded ends.\r\nDon"

    difference if you used Ostrich Sans\"\r\n\r\nI often cannot tell subtle differences
    between fonts. Here I can. WestJet has less artifice and is more graceful than
    Ostrich Sans, the TA kerning notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nBut if I needed a font in
    that style, I might consider Ostrich Sans if nothing closer showed up. Thanks
    again. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/untitled2_4125.jpg]"

    may not be a font at all but drawn in the animation program or if a font at least

    together in an animated video.\r\nI also mentioned that Ostrich could be edited.
    For example with a little bit of work I made some letters that are rather close
    -- something that can be readily duplicated by anyone with some font editing skills:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OstrichEditedHASHTAGb_3660.jpg]\r\nBTW
    this is a font where editing is allowed.\r\nDon"

    base glyphs.

    something. Might be Ostrich, might be something else. It was fun to reverse engineer
    the letters. Nice \"friendly\" S and G.\r\nDon"
