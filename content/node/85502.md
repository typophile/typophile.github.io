  mostly looking for what the ampersand is. I would assume it's whatever the letters
  are."

  body: That ampersand is different. The curve at the top extends too far downward
    and in the photo the cross bar on it curves outward a bit. Close, but not the
    same.

  body: "You maybe right...\r\nThe ampersand is not very clear due to the angle the
    photos were taken.\r\nAll other letters seems to match very well to the above
    typefaces.\r\n"
