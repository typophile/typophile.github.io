  our Berlin gallery space and are looking for your photographic contributions.\r\n\r\nMost
  of us are avid collectors of interesting type and lettering, photographing the variety
  of letters we find in our everyday lives (even more so now thanks to our iPhones
  and other various smart phones). Our upcoming show titled \"New Vintage Digital
  Vernacular Letters\" will showcase the huge variety of beautiful letters from all
  over the world that are encountered and archived.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe deadline
  is coming up quickly \u2013 you have <strong>2 weeks</strong> to create some new
  images or to send us some existing finds. <strong>All images need to be received
  by Wednesday, January 25th</strong> to be included.\r\n\r\nYou simply need to snap
  some photos and email them to photos@motaitalic.com and include your name (as you'd
  like it to be displayed on our website and in the show) and an optional link to
  your website.\r\n\r\nThe only requirements are that the images be square, the main
  subjects are type, and that they are your original photos.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.motaitalic.com/gallery/exhibitions/new-vintage-digital-vernacular-letters|More
  information is available here.]] If you have any questions please don't hesitate
  to ask!\r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing your images! And please feel free to help
  spread the word!"

  body: "Hey Hrant,\r\n\r\nThe original concept was to simply build the show up with
    Instagram/Hipstmatic/or similar types of images sent in mostly via users' phones\u2026
    The technology aspect is the main thread tying together the rather general topic
    of 'photos of found type'.\r\n\r\nHowever, type is the most important aspect,
    so I'm hesitant to turn away any special photos... Maybe I will need to adjust
    the title and concept some.\r\n\r\nYou could always just take a new photo of one
    of your older photos :P"

    film for it.  :-)\r\nAnd I don't have a cellphone. (No, I'm not kidding.)\r\n\r\nBut
    I do have the <em>perfect</em> old sign to take a photo of, so I'll just\r\ntry
    my luck with that. And then there's this incredible thing:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4787419207/in/set-72157627102851774\r\nOf
    which I could take a photo of how it looks now (with the bottom-left fixed).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks David. This one is already several weeks ahead in preparations compared
    to our last few shows :P\r\n\r\nBut it's always a balancing act... the gallery,
    shop and type faces all demand a lot of time. Luckily, this exhibition will be
    up for a bit longer than normal which will give more time for the next two shows
    to get properly organized (maybe there will be a font release in there sometime
    too).\r\n\r\nYou still have just over a week to send us some of your photos! Get
    to it! We'd love to have you here."
