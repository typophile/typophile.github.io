body: "Why is leadership so important in the graphic design field? Some of the perks
  to this business is to be able to sip coffee in your pj\u2019s and go to work. In
  some of my research I have found a few journals that suggest that designers need
  to be more proactive in their field, by getting to know the firms that contract
  your services. This, made me think, that in order to be a leader in your field you
  need to pick and choose who you work for. However that can be super hard to do in
  this economic uncertainty. For those of you on this cite who are leaders in their
  field, how did you get there, what are some tips on how to navigate your clients
  and keep your artistic integrity. I feel like we can make great strides in our field
  by being proactive with our clients, by getting to know who they are and meeting
  their needs, but there is so much more to a good relationship with clients then
  just meeting their needs. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think? \r\n\r\nThanks for giving your
  input and helping a student gain useful insight!\r\n"
