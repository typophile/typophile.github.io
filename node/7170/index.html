		<div class="commentbody">Ramiro <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Private press is an older term so I am not exactly sure what might be meant by this. It depends upon what you want to do and how extensively you want to do it. I assume you mean a non-commercial venture, so I won't discuss commercial machines here.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The most popular entry level letterpress activity today seems to be card printing. When I started out it was book-related printing. There are low-end and high-end presses for both. The problem is any of them take up room and make noise (don't know if these are considerations but if so..). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'd say a floor model Chandler &amp; Price would do you fine if you were interested in card and related kinds of production, and a flatbed cylinder, such as a Vandercook, if you are interested in producing books, broadsides, posters. I've generally seen and experienced much finer quality to the presswork with a Vandercook. The ideal Vandercook is the Universal, followed by the SP series. Both of these were quite popular in the 15 and 20 inch bed size models. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The best press, but it takes considerable skill to operate, would be a smaller floor model iron handpress, such as an Albion. Small foot pattern, no noise, more tool than machine. But relatively expensive, around 5 to 6 grand and hard to find. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've used C&amp;Ps (never liked them), but Vandercooks mostly. I had five of them at one time but I've pulled back quite a bit from my previous printing activity and am down to a small Vandercook SP15 that I picked up many years ago &quot;as new&quot; for $200. With the relatively recent increased interest in letterpress, Vandercooks now run about $1500 to $3500 and it is quite hard to find one in excellent condition. My SP15 has its drawbacks but I am quite familiar with it and for the kind of work I do, it does me well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Had a little beauty of an Albion for quite some time but I actually only used it once for a collotype project. Regretted having to let it go, kind of wish I still had it. The kind of machine that garnered the phrase, &quot;proof of the existence of God.&quot;</div>

Annoyingly, the most interesting effects, like Bodoni Ultra in silver ink on dark green card stock (hey, it was 1970 - BIBA ruled), were the ones that were hardest to pull off cleanly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Using an Adana is certainly the most intimate experience I've ever had with type, and I will always treasure our relationship, stormy though it was.</div>

I ask because in the Monotype Basekerville 24R print I made on Tuesday the &quot;j&quot; has a huge left sidebearing, but in the sample in Sutton's Atlas the spacing is not nearly as bad.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don't know. If you had one of those old Pittman depth gauges though, we could sure find out. I missed one on eBay just last week. An ex-apprentice broke mine when she was cleaning the place and knocked it off the cabinet. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Deeper depth would generally &quot;indicate&quot; strength. Foundry metal is harder and stronger than Monotype and would thus likely have a deeper depth. It has better metallurgy (includes copper in the mix), and could be cast slower (longer), at higher temperatures and under higher pressure, on foundry casters (proprietary machines, sort of). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A j on a foundry caster would be fitted to the body in a continous manner (and would likely not vary much from casting to casting). A j on a Monotype could be fitted to the body in a relative way, and even cast on a wider or narrower body. So the Sutton specimen would not necessarily represent the fitting across the board. Monotype machines weren't proprietary in the sense that they were sold to printers, typesetting firms, et al, and the  owner-operator could adjust the character on the body however he chose, within obvious restriction. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slovenians may be people, as you say, but they sure weren't much of a market for Monotype I'd bet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Was hoping you would mention the Czech Printing Office's close alliance with Monotype. Alas. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There could easily have been two different J's. One on a regular body (to, as you surmise, reduce breakage) and another on a smaller body (with the J overhanging the body). No uncommon with characters such as the cap W. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When we ordered Monotype sorts it was generally required to send a cap M from the existing font so that the operator could align the characters to the correct position on the body. Baseline, side bearings, etc. That would &quot;sort of&quot; ensure that the new sorts matched what you already had. Not all suppliers were competent at this!!!! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There was a lot of possible variance. You could have characters kerned to each other. For instance, a &quot;y&quot; and a period kerned close on one body. So Monotype was quite flexible in this regard and therein lay the problem.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Monotype depth of drive: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->American composition cellular mats are .030&quot; depth. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->American large composition cellular mats 14 to 24 pt inclusive are .050&quot; depth. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->American Giant Caster Caster mats 42 to 72 point are .065&quot; depth. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->British Monotype composition mats, all sizes from 5 to 24 point are .050&quot; depth. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->British Monotype Super Caster mats are .065&quot; depth. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All of these mats are interchangeable between all models of American and British Monotype caster with the appropriate matrix holders and molds. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The strength of kerns is anhanced with a deeper drive, so type cast from British Monotype cellular mats is stronger than that cast on .030&quot; depth American mats. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The deeper or shaller the drive has no bearing on how closely the type can be fitted, since the punches are milled to a vertical wall at both left and right sidebearing, and at the head and foot to avoid hanging of the body pointwise. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This verticality does not create a difficulty in allowing the matrix to be lifted off the newly cast letter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem of variance in alignment from one series of casting from another is completely operator oversight. Each series of typeface has a strict and rigid standard of alignment for the baseline in the form of a numbered steel alignment slip (sort of like the Greenwich Time) which is used on a viewing stand when aligning the cast. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Setwise fitting is also accurate if certain procedures are observed: an operator can use either the em dash centered setwise on the body or in the case of British Monotype cell mats, an alignment &quot;star&quot; is placed in the matrix case. If this is centred point and setwise, alignment and fit are accomplished accurately all in one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The matter of Monotype type being inferior to foundry is of course true to a degree. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. When a person is buying Monotype compsoition castings, whether it is in the form of comped pages or packaged &quot;fonts&quot;, that person is not really buying a type font that is meant to last forever. It is a shame that the foundries that have done and are still casting composition castings as foundry fonts do not make a note of the fact that it is not foundry type. By its nature comp cast type is made in a soft grade of metal, and the Monotype Composition Caster does not have the physics or the strength to deliver the molten metal into the mold cavity in a dense enough manner to make foundry type. A foundry automatic caster works on an entirely different principle verging on brute force. When I cast a font of 10 point for somebody on the Composition Caster, I use hard resmelted foundry metal (ATF, S&amp;B) and the like in the melting pot. This makes the type last a lot longer, but it still is not Foundry type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Monotype Composition mats used on the Thompson Caster with hard foundry metal is very nearly as good as any ATF or Stepehnson Blake type, but ATF is still superior. The same stands for Monotype Display mats used on the Thompson to cast display type. I won't argue that the results are 100% as good as ATF, but ATF ain't there anymore, and the only type a person can find from that company is now either worn, missing characters or to be found in broken sizes. If I were buying type to begin a life in letterpress I wouldn't turn up my nose at well made Monotype type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. Anyone insisting that they must have typoe that is made on a foundry automatic (Barth, Kusterman etc) can have it. Theo Rehak of The Dale Guild is an ex-ATF foundryman, and operates more than a dozen of their old Barths, making limited selections of types. I may be wrong, but I think if anyone wants a full run of ATF Garamond from 8 point to 72 they might be out of luck. On the other hand if they will settle for well made Monotype, it's possible. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Making type, aside from knowing how to release the pump handle, is a matter of how much care the typefounder is willing to put into making the type. I have just completed cutting and casting one of my new designs: 24 and 36 point Duensing Titling. The fonts were cast on my Thompson. I discovered shrtly after I shipped off the last font, that the extremely long tail on the Q was far to fragile to last. I got bust an re-cut both the Q and the U to an .075&quot; depth of drive (since for most applications Q and U are a pair) and cast up more than enough replacement letters to go with the fonts. Since they came out .025&quot; over type-height, I milled the feet down to make the type the correct height. I have mailed these off to the people who bought the fonts so that they won't have any breakage problems on the press. This last comment is only to stress that things can be done to make type better. I certainly don't want anyone to buy a font from me and be sorry they did. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some of when casting for ourselves, will cast special kerns (as Hrant noted; y.) and things like ATA, AYA etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Many fine pieces of work have been and are still being done using Monotype. If I could offer this: Monotype composition type was never intended to fill your cases for use from here to the end. On the other hand if you don't punch the crap out of it on the press it will serve you pretty well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding table top presses, I agree that the Kelsey is the one most likely to break your heart. The Adana models are generally better. Chandler &amp; Price platens are great if you don't expect to fill the chase with type and have it print solidly. It is wiser to get a bigger format than you think you need because a 14x22 or a 12x18 will print small stuff as well as big work, but an 8x12 or a 10x15 has its limits. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am in the last few stages of refurbishing a much abused 14x22 Colts Armory. I expect a lot from it because I put a heap of money into getting it and moving it here. The Colts Armory's reputation is one of great strength, so I am reasonably sure it will print whatever I throw at it. I will be using Monotype incidentally. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim Rimmer</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the superb insight - this is definitely a keeper. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So the Monotype Baskerville I'm looking at, being 24 point, must be 0.05&quot; deep no matter what. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The strength of kerns is anhanced with a deeper drive <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The deeper or shaller the drive has no bearing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; on how closely the type can be fitted <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm seeing some room between those two statements. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If a deeper drive makes for stronger kerns, then something like the &quot;j&quot; is liable to have its left sidbearing exagerated to improve strength depending on depth (as well as alloy quality). So maybe the guy who cast the font I'm dealing with was a tightwad (he used a cheap alloy, and hated having to deal with broken sorts), so he gave the &quot;j&quot; a huge left sidebearing. Or am I missing something? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems to me that when a &quot;user&quot; casts a Monotype font, a balance is struck between: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- sort (and clean-up effort) preservation, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- alloy quality, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- spacing integrity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, at the type design end, letterform fidelity and spacing integrity can be reduced to accomodate the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eventual<!-- raw HTML omitted --> physical issue of broken sorts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Does that makes sense? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; as Hrant noted; y. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the record: that was Gerald. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am not certain why the j would have a wide left sidebearing. Somebody maye indeed have shifted the matrix to the right as a special casting to make the tail of the letter a lesser kern, although I think that would make the fit look terrible. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In a type size as small as 24 point I wouldn't have any fear of the kerned tail breaking off, since it is almost certainly a drive of .050&quot;, and is quite strong in relation to its thickness to its kern, if that makes any sense. On the other hand if you take as an example the generous kern on the tail of the cap Q in 24 point Garamont 248, there is a chance of breaking the kern off in the planing down of the forme or in the printing. This is still at .050&quot; depth of drive. The same instance in 36 point can be very fragile, and must be handled with care in the lockup and planing. And giving it exaggerated impression is certain to both break kerns and wear the type. I like an evident amount of impression, but I have never been a &quot;tactility junkie&quot; . . . is that the expression? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I set up a font on the caster, I make certain that the base alignment and setwise position is correct, and then I carefully follow the 1/4 incremental markings on the matrices. My attitude is that Monotype took a lot of care in the fitting of the suite of matrices, and that is wise to follow it. It's only very rarely that I will feel that they have done something strange with the fit, and I may change the ocasional letter's stance on the body, but that's not very often. Lanston did a great job of making their fonts look right. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A couple of days ago I attended the Alcuin Wayzgoose at the Vancouver Public Library. It was a great success, full of joy, fine work and conviviality. An ex-student of mine, along with Rollin Milroy of Heavenly Monkey Press (that's  real name) came up to my table and showed me a book that they had worked on together; she writing and designing it, and Rollin printing it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The text was in 12 point Garamont 248 with Italic and Small Caps that I had cast for the project. I have to say that they made they type look good, or the type made the book look good. Summation: the Monotype printed beautifull, and Rollin has dissed it back into the case for future use. Rollin prints with a blend of impression, restraint, and good taste. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Many Monotype foundries, both internal and commercial, have in the past used a soft grade of metal. In the shop I apprenticed in the composing room was predominently Linotype, so the Monotype Orphan Annie was compelled to use the same soft metal. It was JW Boyd's habit to treat it as a non-distribution system, so we used the type for the most part just once and then it went into the hell-box. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So as not to suggest that this type was good for only the one-time use, I have to tell you a strange story: After 80 years in business the company eventually abandoned all letterpress, and the composing room effects and equipment went to a smaller printer, who carried on using it for some years. About 15 years ago that company sold the same stuff off cheap to a friend of mine who was operating a fine press. About six years ago she called me and  told me she had a bunch of type, and that I could have it. Once I got the cases home I was flabbergasted so discover that two of the cases  containing 14 and 18 point Nicholas Cochin were types that I had cast when I was about 19 or so. It was certainly the fonts I had cast at JW Boyd becuase of the unusual system we had of laying  extra caps in the boxes abopve the cap side of the case. The type (linotype metal, Monotype cast) is still useable today after more than fifty years. A young student from a local art college worked at my workshop for five days and set a broadsheet of about 50 lines in the 18 point. It was necessary to pick out about a half a dozen worn letters and replace them with better ones. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even though I have the same matrices that came from Boyd's, and can now cast new type on the Thompson, I will always keep the old fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In any case, there is Monotype and there is Monotype, depending on how it was cast. I know that is small comfort to any person buying type. on the other hand there is a lot of ATF type out there that is worn all to hell. It is just as easy to wear out good hard foundry type  in a hundred impressions if the person at the press overdoing the impression. It is also very possible to break kerns on ATF type if it's not handled properly. Sorry for the length of this post. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim Rimmer</div>
