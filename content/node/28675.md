  body: It appears to be Pistilli Roman. I don't know of any digitized version of
    that, but <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/didoni/">Didoni</a>, Phil
    Martin's slightly different version, is very close.

  body: "That's understandable, but, no, it's a current fashion magazine.\r\n\r\nAfter
    looking at some of the preview spreads at http://www.selfservicemagazine.com ,
    I would say that someone has digitized Pistilli Roman for them. One of the features
    of Pistilli Roman is extremely fine hairlines in the thin strokes. There were
    two or three different versions of Pistilli Roman with hairlines of different
    thicknesses--optical scaling for three different display sizes, in effect. The
    one selfservicemagazine uses looks like the thinnest one.\r\n\r\nDidoni was a
    knock-off of sorts and only had one \"optical size\" and the digital version seems
    to hedge on this to make it usable at sizes smaller than 48 point. The hairlines
    are noticeably thicker. Didoni also had a a couple dozen alternate and swash characters
    which are not present in the digital version."

    I got hold of a copy of vitra's new catalogue,\r\nit has this caslon grafique
    like font on the cover. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.designpreis.ch/bilder/medien/download_bilder/Cornel_Windlin_download.jpg\r\n\r\nI
    love the weird look of  its lowercase \"g\" but could not figure out what font
    it is yet.\r\n\r\nthe catalogue is designed by cornel windlin, \r\ni guess he
    even recieved some swiss design award for it.\r\n"
