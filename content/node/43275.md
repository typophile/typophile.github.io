  is that i\u2019m working with a lot of images that i need to number individually
  one by one, that it\u2019s taking me too much time. I was told i could build a table
  in excel and auto generate numbered cells, unfortunetly i\u2019d never worked with
  excel before, so this didn\u2019t got me anywhere.\r\nSo, does anyone knows if it\u2019s
  possible to use any method or aplication to automatically generate numbers that
  could by pasted into another aplication for numbering files?\r\n\r\nSorry bad english\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You can autofill cells in excel with consecutive numbers by selecting a column
    of cells and from the Edit menu choose, Fill / Series... Be sure that the first
    cell in your column has your starting number in it (whether it's 1 or 212 doesn't
    matter), excel will fill the remaining cells in a series from there.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou
    will probably want your images to coincide with those numbers and for that I think
    this video may help...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theindesigner.com/blog/episode-45-the-magnificent-six-video\r\n"
