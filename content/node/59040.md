  body: "It looks like ink-pen lettering using a guide or template. Are you sure this
    is a font? It even looks like it has inkspread on the paper.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I'm not sure if it's a font, but I like it. I found it on a press ad. The
    body copy used under it was VAG Rounded. The only place this font was used was
    in the Header, so maybe it's a custom font. \r\n\r\nThe inkspread effect around
    it is because I have scanned it in and converted it to Black & White."
