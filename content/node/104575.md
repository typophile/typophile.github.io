    15th century type by Nicolas Jenson as his model. Monotype sold it as a font under
    the name Centaur in 1929. Various digital versions of Centaur are now sold by
    Monotype, as Centaur, Adobe, as Centaur, Lanston, as Metropolitan, Bitstream,
    as Venetian 301, and Softmaker, as Cambridge Serial.\r\nDon"
