  input.\r\n\r\nI'm having difficulty finding a suitable font for a men's clothing
  line. The name is \"ALEIXANDRE KORTABERRIA\"\r\n\r\nI'd really rather avoid any
  Didot because I think it's too common and feminine. I've included some examples
  of what I may be looking for below.\r\n\r\nhttp://starworksny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Alexander-Wang-Sa...\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.iso50.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img014-450x82.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  like these sans serifs but the name I'm working with has so many letters that a
  plain font like that may just look boring and uninspired.\r\n\r\nWell I'm open to
  any suggestions you might have.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    probably be more legible and distinctive. \r\n\r\nAs for typefaces, have you considered
    slab serifs (Serifa, Rockwell, Stymie), or squarish (Eurostile, Breuer, Geogrotesque,
    Bank Gothic, Microgramma)?\r\n\r\nBTW, the first link is dead."
