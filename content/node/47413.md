body: "Please take a look at [[http://www.TypeIsArt.com|www.TypeIsArt.com]] it was
  recently re-released with some additional features and a new interface design.\r\n\r\nTake
  it for a spin... and let me know what you think. Any feature requests? Typefaces
  you think would make for a good Special Edition? I'm working up a list for the next
  version and would love to have your opinion.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to be in Buffalo
  for TypeCon2008 this week please stop in at [[http://www.224Allen.com|SP@CE224]]
  \ between the end of the day and any night's festivities (5PM-9PM). If the door
  is locked, ring the white doorbell and I'll open up. We are just a block South and
  a block West from the venue where Sagmeister is speaking on Wednesday. \r\n\r\nLet
  me know you're in for TypeCon2008 and I'll uncork a bottle of Ex-Libris Cabernet
  Sauvignon.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TIA_mini_4447.jpg] \r\n\r\nHere
  are some tips for those who bothered to scroll down this far.\r\n\r\n<ul><li>There
  are several key combinations that affect the selected object. (move/rotate/scale)\r\n<li>Hold
  down the space bar and use the arrow keys to move all objects at once.\r\n<li>Don't
  forget to save!\r\n<li>Let it sit for 10 minutes for an animated treat.\r\n<li>Check
  it out again soon to see the first Special Edition featuring a treat from the folks
  at P22.\r\n</ul>\r\n"
