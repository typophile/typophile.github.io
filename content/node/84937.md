  bound bible), and a smaller size (somewhere between a paperback and hardcover).'

    \"narrowest\" (i.e.,m smallest) standard American size I know of is 5.5 x 8.5,
    but that's not \"between a paperback and a hardcover.\" Trade paperbacks are 6
    x 9.\r\n\r\nIf you are designing the book, can't you specify whatever size you
    want? Or are you limited to standard sizes?"

  body: Thanks, Joshua! There are some budget concerns, and so I would not want to
    get too eccentric if I don't have to.

  body: "> narrowest book page stock\r\n\r\nAre you self-publishing a book? You should
    consult with your publisher or print shop before picking a page size. And keep
    in mind that publications are normally printed on large sheets with multiple pages
    per sheet. "

  body: "What James said. The printing press is the key here, and you really need
    to know what dimensions it will have. If the book will be a longer run, it will
    probably run on a web unit. In that case, the cutoff on the press will define
    sizes.\r\n\r\nMore likely, it will run on a sheet fed. Book stock can run on 25x38
    inch sheets, although that is a large press, and 19x25 is more common. Do the
    math. 19/2 and 25/4 gives you an 9.25 by 6 book, 16 pages per sheet (allowing
    for trimming). You can go to a 19/2 and 25/2 for 8 pages per sheet (you are printing
    on both sides) to get a 12x9.25 book. \r\n\r\nOf course, some presses will be
    other sizes, and this will constrain your finished dimensions.\r\n\r\nAs James
    says, talk to a printer ... preferably the one you want to print the book. (Be
    aware that the small little print shop will be able to print the book, but if
    you are going to run over 500 or so copies, the cost may not be effective, because
    small presses will only print 2 pages per sheet for a larger book. They often
    can only go to 18x22 paper.\r\n\r\n(I hope you are in the US/Canada ... otherwise
    this non-metric talk will be confusing. But the same rule applies ... talk to
    a printer)."
