  the type face used in Bentley Motors brand. It's close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/|Interstate]]
  or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dunwich/armitage/|Armitage]] but I don't think
  it is either.\r\n\r\nNote the \"O\" is almost a circle, the middle prong on the
  \"E\" is shorter, the stand on the \"R\" looks to have a slight curve, and the \"B\"
  is not symmetrical as the top appears smaller.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can take a stab
  at this I would be grateful.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nBen "
