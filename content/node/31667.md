body: "G'day guys,\r\n\r\nBit of a strange request. I'm designing a book cover which
  calls for a fake real estate sign. I want to put a visible phone number on the bottom
  but I don't want to use a real number, I also don't want to use the obv. 555-01XX
  thing. Has anyone else been in this position? Is there an easy way to check whether
  a number would work or not?\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n--N"

    about, like, dialing the number? Seriously, you might consider your local \"time
    and temperature\" number."

  body: I'd imagine there's a bunch of open numbers but how long they stay open could
    be an issue. Your best bet would probably be to find an unused area code and put
    whatever number you like after it.

  body: "Yeah thanks,\r\n\r\nI tried the number and it didn't work, but I don't know
    whether that will be the case in Norway or the US for example. Anyways, I think
    I solved my own problem by obscuring it with lettering, but it would be handy
    to know for future projects. Thanks for the help, time and temperature is a nice
    idea ;)\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n--N"

  body: "There are charts of restricted exchanges; one option would be to use a 411,
    611, or 911- number, as those are restricted exchanges in most area codes in order
    to free up emergency and/or service features for the telephone company. eg. (204)
    911-1234 would be a fake number because 911 in Manitoba is a strictly emergency-only
    number.\r\n\r\nAlternately, the form at http://www.telcodata.us/telcodata/telco
    allows you to enter an area code and see which exchanges are currently in use;
    pick one that isn't listed and you're guaranteed there's no numbers on that exchange.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    I notice you're in Australia, and I'm not sure how the phone system works there,
    but my answer was good for a terribly North-American-centric answer to the problem."

    and let them get flooded with calls asking about real estate.
