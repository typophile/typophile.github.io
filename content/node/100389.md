  I believe fits better with their brand, however they've got hung up on the non-aligning
  numerals and I can't seem to find an easy way to set them aligned in our print.
  Maybe it's not possible... if that's the case, does anyone have a work around or
  any ideas to help sell them back to the client?!\r\n\r\nAny thought appreciated.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nHugo"

    you're in InDesign, go to Character menu > OpenType > Tabular Lining."

  body: "I think I must have a different version as the Tabular Lining option has
    a bracket around it. Is there a particular version of Freight Sans which allows
    this?\r\n\r\nThanks for your quick reply. "

  body: "You licensed this from Phil's Fonts.\r\nhttps://philsfonts.com/index.php/results/strip?q=freight+sans&mysubmit=&type=3\r\n\r\nThe
    options are the Pro version, with small caps and alternate \uFB01gures integrated
    as OpenType features, or the plain version, with oldstyle \uFB01gures as default,
    and lining \uFB01gures in a separate small caps font.\r\n\r\nI would suggest you
    either \u201Cupgrade\u201D by licensing the Small Caps version to add to what
    you already have, or license the OpenType version; perhaps the distributor will
    give you a discount on this.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThis customer service is provided
    by a disinterested party at no charge, but really you should be contacting the
    distributor from whom you licensed the font, or the foundry that made it. Why
    didn\u2019t you do that, rather than asking at Typophile?"

  body: Actually, what offends me is the stupidity of the question. <em>Of course</em>
    you can choose tabular or lining figures so <em>why are you bothering us</em>?

    licensed one version, send them an email. Good people.
