  body: "Ricardo,\r\nThis is probably not the right place to discuss this problem,
    but I don't know where to get help.\r\nThe link you sent... yes, I know where
    my posts are, but as you see, 40 weeks ago is the most recent one that is in that
    archive; however, I post twice in December 2014. Where are those posts? I found
    some of them by going through all the old posts, page by page, and found two of
    my posts. There are many of my posts that are not with \"My Posts.\"\r\nHow can
    I find all of my old posts? They are not there with my archived posts."

    the posts you\u2019re referring to were made to the Type ID Board.\r\nUnfortunately,
    those don\u2019t show up under My posts/Track.\r\nThe workaround I use is this:\r\nhttps://duckduckgo.com/?q=Posted+by+Lap+site%3Atypophile.com\r\nYou
    can use the same syntax with your search engine of choice."

    posts are no longer archived in My Profile/My Posts as they used to be? I'm sorry
    if that be true; I like to go back and review my other posts.\r\nAre either of
    you the administrator or moderator? How did you know how to find this link and
    will it remain valid to find my old posts?\r\nOne last thing, is there a way that
    I, myself, can place these posts My Profile/My Posts.\r\n\r\nThank you both so
    much for coming to my rescue. \r\n\r\nLap"

    this site.\r\nWhat I can tell you is that just the links to the posts in the new
    Type ID Board aren\u2019t listed with the others.\r\nHowever, the posts themselves
    are just like any other one on the website. This means that, as long the website
    is being indexed by search engines\u2019 spiders, they will show up using the
    appropriate query.\r\nYou can also obtain similar results through http://typophile.com/search/google/"
