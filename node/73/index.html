I tried to spell things out as clearly but simply as possible for translation purposes, but who knows how clearly the matter will be understood at the Japanese end. <BR> <BR>Playing Devil's Advocate here &hellip; <BR> <BR>Both ITC and Esselte list Magnificat under their trademark listings: <BR><a href="http://www.eyewire.com/copyright/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.eyewire.com/copyright/">http://www.eyewire.com/copyright/</a></a> <BR><a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/about/legal.asp?nCo=AFMT" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/about/legal.asp?nCo=AFMT">http://www.itcfonts.com/about/legal.asp?nCo=AFMT</a></a> <BR> <BR>ITC, Letraset, Linotype -&gt; none of them seem to offer Magnificat as a digital font. Nobody seems to. <BR> <BR>Here's a reference I thoroughly enjoyed, but failed to find last night, that confirms Mr. Lawley's evidence trail leading to Magnificat: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.pkfont.co.uk/page5.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.pkfont.co.uk/page5.htm">http://www.pkfont.co.uk/page5.htm</a></a> <BR> <BR>May we (me being a neophyte relative to you) reasonably assume that Magnificat likely never got past the dry transfer sheet state? <BR> <BR>OK, so here we have a mid-20s Japanese designer/typographer who probably comes across a print usage of Magnificat somewhere (Gamme's 'a' is different from the image Philip Kelly shows, which suggests that Kivart didn't see all of the characters of Magnificat). &quot;Beautiful!&quot; he exclaims. What could he reasonably conclude about its status as a font? <BR> <BR>If it were a font, the language barrier would make the necessary detective work mighty tough. I'd have to agree here, though, with your statement about ignorance not being an excuse. <BR> <BR>If it's not even a font, the mission to find a source would have been well nigh impossible! Heck, he may even have (quite reasonably IMO) concluded that the print image he saw was hand drawn. <BR> <BR>In light of this, I'm: <BR>1) Glad that Kivart digitized the thing. It's hardly something to &quot;widely use&quot;, but it's unique, arguably beautiful and evidently usable in magazine copy. It surely would never have seen the light of day as a font without Kivart's skills. Plus, it's an original version, with, apparently, at least one character different from Magnificat to boot. <BR> <BR>2) Pretty sure that &quot;font pirate&quot; is overkill condemnation here. <BR> <BR>3) Hopeful that Kivart contacts Mr. Peter, which would now be the right thing to do</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Since I&rsquo;ve stumbled on this thread nearly five years late, no one will read this, BUT &hellip;
I thought the comment by Friedrich Peter about receiving no royalties was pretty sad. Magnificat won second prize in Letraset&rsquo;s 1973 International Typeface Competition, for which there were 2590 entries. According to the company&rsquo;s handout, he received £750 and a &ldquo;generous royalty agreement.&rdquo; I never saw Magnificat used, however &ndash; or either of the other two cash winners: Bombere, by Carla Ward of Washington, DC (£1000); and Stilla, by Francois Boltana of France (£500).</p>
<p>The judges were Derek Birdsall, Roger Excoffon, Colin Forbes, Armin Hoffmann, Herb Lubalin, and Marcello Minale.
(Was that the only international competition that Letraset sponsored?)</p>
<p>There were 18 more winners, who were also supposed to have received a royalty deal but no cash. I really didn&rsquo;t see much of any of those fonts in use, either &ndash; except for the still-popular LeGriffe, by Andre-Michel Lubac, and Vic Carless&rsquo;s Shatter.</p>
<p>Shatter was one of three winners in the group of 20 that were based on Helvetica. The other two were Process and Suds &ndash; the latter was Helvetica Medium caps that were made up of black outline + white fill circles of various sizes, to look like letters made of soap bubbles.</p>
<p>My favorite of all the winners was Vincent, by Trevor Vincent of the UK. It was a deco-ish face with thin white lines that sectioned the letters to suggest ceramic tile. I never saw a full showing of it.</p>

Actually I had my business card printed, where my name was in Magnificat, 18 years ago, at a printer in Bremerhaven, Germany. Later I wanted this &ldquo;magnificent&rdquo;;-) font in digital form, but only found that Friedrich Peter, living in Canada was the original designer. I think he also designed Vivacious&hellip; not sure though.
Anyhow, nowhere is this font available, which is a pity.</p>
<p>There is a Wikipedia page on this font: <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnificat_%28font%29">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnificat_%28font%29</a></p>
