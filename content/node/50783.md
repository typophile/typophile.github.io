  looks close to Charter or Admark.  I need to know this for a logo recreation in
  vector art form.  I did ask the company if they knew what font was used and unfortunately
  they do not know.\r\n\r\nIdentifying factors (just to name a few) is the roundness
  of the \"o\", the length of the \"p's\" descender (which of course could of be manipulated),
  the squareness of the \"p's\" slab on the bottom, and the round points and serifs
  of the \"c\" and \"e\".  I do not think the font is actually an outline font just
  made to look like one.\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch for any suggestions in advance,\r\n"
