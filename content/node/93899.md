  my work is lacking in taste and creativity, I'm okay at the ideas side of thing
  it's just the more artistic attributes of scale, rhythm and negative space that
  I struggle with.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone else ran into these problems outside
  of uni and what you did to overcome them. Are there any exercises I can do to improve
  my art skills, I draw everyday on trains and read through typography manuals in
  a desperate attempt to get better but I just feel I'm lacking that edge.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\nAndrew"

  body: "I always recommend \uFB01nding a text-heavy old advertisement from the days
    of letterpress, one with roman, small caps and italics and some justi\uFB01cation,
    and attempting to create a facsimile digitally.\r\n\r\nFirst, you have to identify
    the typeface (Matt McGrew will help), and \uFB01nd one which has a corresponding
    digital version, then set it in InDesign. The H&Js are particularly tricky.\r\n\r\nSure,
    this is old school print stuff, but typographic sophistication is increasing on
    screen, and the point of the exercise is to develop an eye for \uFB01ne distinctions,
    and practical taste, through solving subtle visual-technical problems.\r\n\r\nIn
    fact, why not try to duplicate the document in html?\r\n"

    body: "Wow thanks Nick.\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to the release of your new
      site so I can read some of your essays they sound pretty fascinating, particularly
      the one on Helvetica and its relationship (on not so relationship) with Fascism.\r\n\r\nI'll
      give the Facsimile a shot, it sounds like it could be really great, I feel a
      Muller Brockmann search could be in order :).\r\n\r\nIf you've got any other
      exercises I'd love to give them a shot. "
