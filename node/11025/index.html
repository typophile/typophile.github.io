  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Background<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gematria is something of a mix between a grotesque and a humanist sans.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wanted a sans serif less funky than Helvetica, but with more character   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->than the recent super generic sans like Myriad. It's also a reaction   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->against the trend towards increasing x-height and counter-sizes. The   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ascenders and descenders are large and in charge, close to the elegant   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->proportions of Futura. The counters are dimished, recalling the time   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->before readability trumped character. The intersections of lines are   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->heavy, trapping be damned, increasing contrast not only between but   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->within glyphs.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Status<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've just wrapped up the basic upper case. I'm mostly satisfied with the   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->structure of all the characters. Work still remains to weight some   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->characters properly (see: g, all the triangular upper case). Spacing is   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->messy. Right now it's probably too closely set, but this is my fifth   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->complete iteration on the lower case metrics. I'm having a tough time   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->finding the right looseness to make it easy to pick out words quickly (I   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->haven't lost all sight of readability) while maintaining a pleasant page   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->texture. I'm also unsure of the right balance between spacing wide for   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->caption sizes and narrow for display sizes. Opentype to the rescue?   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Specific Concerns<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How can I make the g fit in more? It feels out of sorts. If I make the   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strokes thicker, it fits in a bit better but feels very clotted.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was much more confident in the f when I first started this design.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Should I ditch it?   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is there a standard solution to the too many vertical strokes problem in   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->words like 'million'? The sequence illi feels very dark compared to the   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rest of the page.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What do ya'll think of the y? The triangular characters have always   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bugged me and y seems like a triangular shape that doesn't have to be   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->so.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Phantom Modulation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->see thread<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I ended up compensating for this effect and the results are much more   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pleasing. I'd been building the less geometrical characters (a, h, n, m,   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->s, t, r, u, y) with the compensation automatically since I had to   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eyeball the strokes to make sure they felt balanced. When I compensated   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the more symmetrical structured characters, they felt more in tune   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with the rest of the set.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I found it better in my case to leave the counters of characters (b, c,   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->d, e, g, o, p, q) perfectly symmetrical with no slant and to instead   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->compensate for the phantom modulation with their outer path. This helped   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me avoid too much humanist feel from creeping into the design and made   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the characters feel like they stand mostly upright.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Download the PDF<!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are some nice things happening in this design. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't have a problem with the g, but I'd be a little concerned about the space between the bowls closing up at small sizes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At first the f struck me as too unusual for an otherwise conservative face, but I don't find that it draws too much attention to itself in text. Try living with it a bit longer, but give some thought to an alternative, less radical form. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't mind the top part of the y, and think it is a good idea to try something other than the diagonal version. However, the bottom part looks truncated and also adds to the impression that the top part is too wide (it may, in fact, be a tad too wide compared to the h, n, etc.). Is there a way to extend the descending curve to the left, without getting into the kind of closed-up shaped of the Helvetica g? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding the sequence of i and l, you could try having very slightly wider sidebearings on the i. You can also try making the ascending stems slightly lighter than those that terminate at the x-height; because of their length, they will tend to look denser than the shorter strokes. I have not printed your PDF, so I am taking your word for it that the sequence <!-- raw HTML omitted -->illi<!-- raw HTML omitted --> looks dark.</div>

Readability actually benefits from a smaller [than average] x-height. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The intersections of lines are heavy, trapping be damned <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Actually, that's &quot;optical compensation&quot; (in my book) - trapping is [mostly] to fight gain. But anyway, this is an approach that might have hidden functionality (as well as easthetic appeal to some), since information comes from contrast. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I'm also unsure of the right balance between spacing wide for caption sizes and narrow for display sizes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's related to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->intent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the face, which ties in to things like color, width, x-height etc. In this case I would say this is a texty font - and the spacing is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->slightly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> too loose ovreall (and inconsistent in places, like the right of the &quot;r&quot;, and elsewhere). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, your vertical proportions are right on. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And the caps are solid - congrats. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the g <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's out of place because it's too humanist. Give it some edge - and maybe an open bottom bowl. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;f&quot; is fine! I think the &quot;j&quot; could be more humanist. I like the &quot;y&quot; too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overall, I think you're meeting your objective, and producing an interesting voice: at once retro and futuristic, plus a nice balance between rationality and charm. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
