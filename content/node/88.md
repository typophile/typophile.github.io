body: One of you suggested to check out the fonts on Letterhead Fonts - and I love
  them! But I wanted to see if any of you knew any fonts that are similar to these
  styles... <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/contributors/kenmctague/bostontruckstyle.shtml"

  <BR><a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/letterheadfonts/convecta.shtml" target="_blank">www.letterheadfonts.com/letterheadfonts/convecta.shtml</a>
  <BR> <BR>especially looking for the bevel type look...as well do any of you know
  where I could get a &#34;swoosh&#34; font similar to <BR><a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/contributors/tomkennedy/pilsner.shtml"

  body: Dangerboy, stop kidding yourself. ;&#41; You won&#39;t be able to  <BR>find
    digital type of this style and quality for less money.  <BR>Trust me, you get
    what you pay for. Personally I think the  <BR>prices over at Letterheadfonts are
    very decent.

  body: I have purchased from Letterhead in the past and found the staff to be very
    helpful. I even experienced some problems receiving the font via email and they
    were very quick to correct the problem. I haven&#39;t really seen any other foundries
    doing this type of work. Even if there are, Letterhead is the leader in this area
    of tyopography. <BR> <BR>I highly recomemend doing business with them!

  body: I&#39;ve had trouble with Emigre&#39;s shopping cart system several times,
    emailed them repeatedly and heard absolutely nothing back. As a designer I wanted
    to order type, as a teacher I wanted to order other materials. Couldn&#39;t do
    either through their site. <BR> <BR>Fortunately there are other ways, but I did
    miss out on some nifty posters.

  body: Strange. I quite recently purchased licences for  <BR>the Cholla family through
    my job, and both the  <BR>Tarzana and Solex families personally, and  <BR>simultaneously
    took advantage of their free Euro  <BR>upgrade of my previous licences. At my
    job the  <BR>shopping cart system worked smooth as a baby&#39;s  <BR>bum, but
    at home I  had some problems too. After  <BR>a fax and two phone calls, they e-mailed
    me all the  <BR>licenses no prob. Even twice, as the first e-mails  <BR>somehow
    got held up and I needed the volumes fast. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s true that sometimes
    when communicating with  <BR>Emigre&#39;s sales department you can experience
    some  <BR>hick-ups, but usually that&#39;s not fatal. <BR>Maybe it could be an
    idea to gather some less good  <BR>experiences and submit them to Emigre.

    <a href="http://www.emigre.com/" target="_blank"> Emigre</a>, <a href="http://www.thirstype.com/"
    target="_blank"> Thirstype</a> and  <BR>especially <a href="http://www.houseindustries.com/"
    target="_blank"> House Industries</a> for example. <BR> <BR>I guess most small
    to mid-size foundries know what  <BR>they&#39;re doing service-wise. Can anybody
    else share  <BR>his/her experiences, good or bad, with certain  <BR>foundries? '

    target="_blank">Monogram English</a>  <BR>that capture the exagerrated brush typical
    of a certain  <BR>formal sign-painter style. It&#39;s an important genre of  <BR>&#40;mostly-American&#41;

    as well</a>.

  body: Thank you to Mr. Coles for clarifying the point I was trying to convey. Emulating
    and digitizing the Sign Painter style was what I was referring to. Your linked
    examples were exactly what I was thinking of, not to mention my personal favorite
    <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/diptripflipfantasia/diptripflipfantasia.shtml">
    Diptripflipfantasia</a>! Just for the crazy name. <BR> <BR>And to Mr. Peters,
    no problem. I understand. I knew I didn&#39;t clarify my point well enough once
    I read your response. Sorry for the confusion.

  body: To be fair, my problems with Emigre&#39;s cart took place about a year ago,
    and I only tried to reach them by email &#40;I&#39;m in Japan, making phone-calls
    to the States no fun for timing and pricing reasons, especially when I should
    be able to use the darn cart!&#41;. <BR> <BR>I just took a gander at their site
    now and walked through a mock sale. I did manage to get past the point that threw
    up a server-side error before, so I will say that that problem no longer exists.
    <BR> <BR>And I will stop now, as this thread was not about problems with Emigre,
    and I do not have a problem with Emigre. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: No indeed it isn&#39;t, but I think it&#39;s interesting to  <BR>know how
    different foundries cope with the specific  <BR>problems related to online ordering.
    Maybe an idea  <BR>for a thread in <i>General Discussions</i>?
