  design to business people in Belgium.\r\nI want to make a logo that can be used
  as patterns or blown up big and remain abstract. Any suggestions for improvements?\r\n\r\n\u2014the

  body: "It's too generic. It could be for a design firm anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the ratio between the icon and the logotype is out of proportion. The icon is
    way too large.\r\n\r\nI don't think the color treatment will translate into black
    & white. Remember, a logo needs to work in all forms of media, including newsprint
    and fax.\r\n\r\nWork on some more concepts and also provide a little more background
    information on what you want to achieve. That will help us give better crits."

  body: "Sebastien, I agree that the proportion is out of balance. If you plan to
    use the 'W' symbol as a scalable entity anyway, why not put it into a proper size
    relationship with the type for the logo? It can always be enlarged or shrunk when
    used in a pattern. \r\n\r\nI <em>do</em> like the 'W' for its simplicity, and
    think it could translate into the pattern element you desire. But it is very dependant
    on its color right now to distinguish the four strokes, as David mentioned above.
    (It's a nice color palette, though!) I also prefer the side-ways version... it
    offers a bit of abstraction to something otherwise very straightforward.\r\n\r\n"

    but I couldn't name it!

  body: I see the ribbon in both. Couldn't you build the idea of rotation and random
    placement into the identity? Love the colors.

  body: I was thinking of what a ribbon does when it is swirled chinese style - in
    a spring like shape. I understand the flatness & like it but a logo meant to be
    for business people should maybe be warmer if feeling. I didn't want to completly
    change the idea so Ithought of a varient... I like the colors too. But the flatness
    seems a little to static & unmoving to me.

  body: "Before you start to play with type & color (unless you have the answers):\r\n\r\n1.
    What do you mean by ... bring\u2014promote\u2014 design to business people in
    Belgium. Why is that? what is the problem with  \"business people in Belgium\"?\r\n\r\n2.
    How would you describe \"Wallonie Design\" to someone who has no knowledge of
    its existence? 10-15 words.\r\n\r\n3. What will \"Wallonie Design\"  likley be
    in 5 years? 10 years?\r\n\r\n4. Try to explore not just symbol-name combination;
    \ try: (a) name only logo. (b) monogram/acronyms.\r\nThen pick the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I would especially like to hear the answers to 1 & 2. 3 is really a guess
    at best but also interesting. It's good to be clear about ambitions I think.

  body: "Thanks a lot this is great feed back. I can't really go into details about
    this job because I am behind with my work in general. It is a competition and
    I don't really know a lot about Wallonie Design. What I got from the \u201Cbrief\u201D
    is that they want to bring design to manufacturers and service providers in the
    south of Belgium (Wallonie). Could be by means of conference, helping businesses
    commissioning work, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks again, your input is genuinely helping
    me."
