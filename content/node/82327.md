body: "I working with Tim Botts [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Botts]] on
  converting some of his calligraphy to fonts.\r\n\r\nInitially, we're going to take
  one font through the creation process just to get a feel for the process. So, I'd
  like to start with a good one. Beyond the initial posting, this will help to give
  me an idea of what to create next as well.\r\n\r\nHere are the options that I'm
  selecting from. The image below is a composite of Tim's calligraphy and Barry Smith's
  [[http://studiosmith.blogspot.com/]] design work.\r\n\r\nIf you care to vote, I'd
  be interested in hearing on the following...\r\n- which is your favorite\r\n- what
  font would you be most likely to buy, and why\r\n\r\nThanks for you help!\r\n\r\n<img

  body: '#3. They''re all amazing, though. You''re going to keep the rough, hand-drawn
    quality, right?'

    you to concentrate on how to handle the \"distress\".\r\nAll the others will require
    some sort of contextuality, which is a whole new ball game."

  body: Nick is right - start with Number 4 - it will be a good one to learn on. Plus
    Four has solid sales appeal. This looks like a great collection Josh.

  body: "Before doing a whole font of any of them, I'd think you'd want to prototype
    all of them \u2014\_perhaps just converting the current samples to individual
    digital letters \u2014 to see which best tolerate the limitations of the font
    environment. \r\n\r\n#4 may have the simplest shapes, but it has the most complex
    surface treatment (looks like it was created with an ink roller?) You will inevitably
    find there's a tradeoff between simplicity of drawing & the visual character of
    the result."
