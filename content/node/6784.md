  body: 'I don&#39;t think this is a font. Think about it: How hard would it have
    been for the designer of this poster to draw one letter &#40;really&#41; that
    looks like one of the WTC towers versus finding a typeface that just <i>happened</i>
    to have an A that looked that way already? I would bet on the former.'

    target="_blank">Armada</a> does have an A that is close to the proportions &#40;except
    the top is curved, instead of flat with chamfered corners&#41;. Light Compressed,
    I think.
