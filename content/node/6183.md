body: G&#39;day. I think that the body is one typeface and the numerals are a separate
  face, but I am not too sure. What are they? Any help is much appreciated!  <BR>

  body: The numbers are <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-eras/book/testdrive.html?s=524-8191&amp;p=48">Eras</a>,
    while the text looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/condensed/testdrive.html?s=Collingwood-Puponga%2BRd&amp;p=48">Helvetica
    Condensed</a>, though a little wider. But the condensed has that large x-height.
