body: "Hi, im currently involved in a graphics project at uni where i have designed
  a typeface and now have been asked to design a type specimen poster.\r\nWhen designing
  the typeface it was required that we link the it to a theme and I chose the title
  \u2019motion\u2019 i explored body motion and related letters to the shapes in which
  the human body makes when in movement.\r\nIts required that the type specimen poster
  has some sort of connection to the theme, full set of characters and a supporting
  typeface.\r\nI have done a few mock ups, and would really appreciate some feedback!
  note, one poster is required to be printed onto A2.\r\nTell me they are good, average
  or absolutely rubbish, just please say why :)\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nPoster 1 http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/2227/typespecimen12.jpg\r\n\r\nPoster

  body: "A type specimen must be well designed, of course, but it also has to serve
    as a reference for designers to study the letterforms and see how the typeface
    looks in various applications. Your posters have a lot of white space, but not
    a lot of type on view. It would be useful to show text paragraphs in multiple
    sizes. (I am, of course, a pigheaded American who had to Google A2 to find out
    how big that is, but now that I know, it appears the only text on your poster
    is about 12 pt.) I also recommend you make the text paragraphs black-on-white,
    which gives better contrast than color-on-color.\r\n\r\nIt appears the weight
    of your lowercase is too heavy for the weight of your caps, but it's hard to be
    sure at the size on my screen. And lose the little feet on the capital <strong>I</strong>.
    They won't print properly except in very large sizes, and even then, they're a
    little precious. "
