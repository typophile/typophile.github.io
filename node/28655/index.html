		<div class="commentbody">Assuming calligraphy as the spring of typography, in old-style typefaces (used as fonts) text figures are usually the same height as a lowercase x, they are not capitals, nor uncial, they are &lsquo;minuscule&rsquo;. The ductus is the number, direction and sequence of the strokes that makes up a character. These days, some typefaces intended for text even make old-style figures the default numerals. FontShop, for example, usually makes old-style figures the default; Adobe doesn&rsquo;t. But it can vary from font to font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I do think that, as James' posting indicates, the shapes of the numbers are not as settled those as of the roman letters. And so the designer has a little more latitude with them.</p>
<p>In Paul Shaw&rsquo;s &lsquo;letter tour&rsquo; of lower Manhattan that I went on a month ago we saw a lot of stone carved letters where eg, 1931 had only the 9 descending, not the 3. There were a number like this, with other letters same height on the top and the 9 descending. They were perfectly readable and didn&rsquo;t look odd; in fact many were quite nice.</p>
<p>Obviously a lot has to do with context. If you have an old style font, not following the convention for text figures is going to look out of place. But eg in an address or date or more modern face variations may look good.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is great feedback. Several voices gives a far richer impression than one could. Phinney&rsquo;s blog is great example of thoughtful passion for a field without zealotry, and I&rsquo;veenjoyed it for a while. The traditionalist view, in this case is important to me to understand.</p>
<p>Anyone here who is inclinded to care knows that my most traditional fonts are pretty &lsquo;out there&rsquo;; most are far past that. Nevertheless, I try to borrow legibilty and other tricks from the classical camp, so that the fonts can offer more utility than most display styles.</p>
<p>In this case, I&rsquo;m working on a postmodern tall rectangular face with just enough ornamentation to seem&hellip; retro? It&rsquo;s a gift for my wife. Line figures were boring, text figures seem to both read better and add to the plyfulness intended. So, I&rsquo;ve arranged the letters into the traditional lining, then fiddled with it very slightly. The current arangement <em>seems</em> to be classical, except the 4 sits on the baseline.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Most of what I read here makes sense to me. I have seen a lot of the exceptions to which people are referring. The ascending 5 can look pretty cool and &ndash; more to the point &ndash; quite normal in some typefaces. My own opinion is that the figures should be made to blend in pleasantly with the text, and that is much more tricky than just following rules. Really, a lot of non-lining figures look bad because the designer just &ldquo;made the 4 descend&rdquo; without considering how it harmonizes with text. (I&rsquo;ve had my own trouble with this very thing, so I sympathize.) I also am always interested to see cases of &ldquo;semi-lining&rdquo; figures and other strange hybrids. They can be educational case-studies about what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you want to see an interesting real-world case, check out the changes in the non-lining figures between the original, Type 1 version of Utopia, and the figures in the OpenType version.</p>

Second, seeing that the terminals on the 6 and 9 would get crowded with the heavy strokes of the eye of the 6 and 9. Hence the idea of using a pointed terminal to reduce crowding.</p>
<p>However, in the 235 you have the ball terminals opposite a thin part, so they don&rsquo;t crowd so much, meaning put too much weight together. And an important part of the &lsquo;look&rsquo; of Utopia comes from the ball terminals on the a and c. The ball terminals on the 235 echo and reinforce this, particularly on text figures, which will go with the lower case. Also if you change 235 you probably have to change them on the lining figures, and further lose harmony with the face.</p>
<p>Hence this compromise to achieve the goal of making the text figures more compact.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>Christopher, why do you think the ball terminals were removed on the 6/9?</cite></p>
<p>The theories above are as good as any. I remember talking with Robert about it at the time he made the changes, but I don&rsquo;t remember him explaining that. (Which is not to say I didn&rsquo;t just forget!)</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s most interesting to me is that there is an overall improvement &ndash; in that the figures just harmonize with the text more. Utopia is a good case for the this particular thread, I think, because the original figures always struck me as a little forced; they conform to the rules of how non-lining figures should be, but they were perhaps lacking design maturity, and never looked comfortable to me. Robert has learned a lot about such things since the early days when he made Utopia, so I think it&rsquo;s reflected in the changes. The figures are, overall, a bit smaller in scale, and all the ascending and descending figures don&rsquo;t look so stretched out. The proportions of each shape are more pleasant.</p>
<p>Anyone designing non-lining figures who thinks, &ldquo;Just change the 3 to align with the lowercase x-height and descender height&rdquo; might also take some time to actually <em>look</em> at the results. It&rsquo;s often not so simple.</p>
<p>Of course the other thing going on with Utopia, I think, is that it&rsquo;s a sort of transitional-modern, and non-lining figures just don&rsquo;t always work as well with such designs. I use Utopia Std for a newsletter I make, and I think the lining figures work better &ndash; so as much as I love Utopia, I still am hesitant to use its non-lining figures.</p>
<p>Probably this is why such typefaces &ndash; used so often for magazines and such &ndash; often have more diminutive lining figures or some hybrid. There is less tradition with these more modern styles, and they often benefit from more experimental approaches, at least for type designers with good eyes who are willing to look and think about it.</p>

In any artwork I do, I try not to discard a rule until I have a reason, and cant have that until I understand the rule. Looking at a display font, one could think, &ldquo;oh, look, a display font with text figures, how interesting&rdquo;, or they could say, &ldquo;hmmm, I wonder why the numbers are all crooked-like. How lame.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d prefer the former, if that was the intention. !Exclamachine&rsquo;s agenda is to make bizarre fonts that are more typographer-friendly, so I&rsquo;m attacking that from several angles.</p>
<p>As far as the legibility, I will be doing a good bit of work on the weight, contrast and spacing. I will keep fidling with contours until I get a more pleasant &lsquo;carved&rsquo; look. The above is pretty early on, with just the basic forms of the glyphs defined.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to do old style figures for this face, I mean, it&rsquo;s a modern.
However, after implementing both proportional and tabular figures in OpenType, I realized that because of the way InDesign implements OT figures, it&rsquo;s either one style or four (because if the font contains only proportional and tab lining figures, the palette nonetheless shows old style figures as an option). So I made the old style figures &ndash; or perhaps they should be called postmodern figures. What do you think, is this a travesty?</p>

I can&rsquo;t speak for Nick but it makes sense to me.  IMHO, The serif on the lining figures hits the baseline and emphasizes it. The stem of the 4 on the oldstyle figures comes below the line and gets the feel of a decender.  Putting a serif on it would make too strong a horizontal pull below the baseline and give a line of figures too wavy of a look and fight the supposedly stronger baseline in lower case.</p>

<p>I often &ldquo;cheat&rdquo; on the height of oldstyle 2, making it slightly higher than the top of the 3.</p>
<p>Chris is right about the serif. I think it&rsquo;s for standing on, so if the letter is sitting on the baseline with the leg hanging, then the toe drops down.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>At Typecon, Akira Kobayashi recalled the anecdote of how, with trepidation, he asked Adrian Frutiger if it would be OK for Linotype to add old style figures to the Frutiger face. No problem, said AF, and drew the designs on the spot, in a couple of seconds (Akira showed the sketch): but here&rsquo;s the kicker &ndash; he drew the 4 standing on the baseline, not sitting. However as eventually implemented, it&rsquo;s sitting. I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to ask Akira about this (my reputation is churlish enough), but I did wonder.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Choz &ndash; You should try a version where your proportions are strictly conventional for OSF. Your treatment of detail, and curve shapes, are unusual enough that I don&rsquo;t think you will be compromising your design by doing that, and you will gain in &ldquo;disambiguation&rdquo;.</p>

That sounded more complicated than I wanted.</div>

I tried that, however the &lsquo;4&rsquo; always looked bottom heavy suddenly. That may just be my ersonal quirks reading, not sure. I would like the clarity of conventionality, and with OT can might include both arrangements.</p>
<p>Nigella - 
It looked more retro when I started, I swear! Since then, I&rsquo;ve removed about 1/3 of the serifs, tapered strokes to points, and actually &lsquo;borrowed a little&rsquo; from some calligraphy my wife left out. Table figuresd will also be included, but I was still planing as having the text style as default. I will re-evaluate that when the letters are done. At this point the zeroes are slightly narrower than the O &amp; o, and the &lsquo;noise&rsquo; of the strokes is varied. Except where I want it ambigous, my zeros are usually narrower.</p>
<p>marco - 
I&rsquo;ve read that that is a french tradition, where the z more commonly has a descender. Sounds like a good idea in any face where that is the case, though.</p>

<p>Interesting. Mine start at the 1 o&rsquo;clock (near right corner) position. Likely, that&rsquo;s an adaptation to left-handedness. I wonder what other letters I&rsquo;ve got an altered POV on, due to learing alternate strokes for coming at text from the flip side!?</p>
<p>Are there other lefties out there? Do they have any thoughts on this, or pointers?</p>
