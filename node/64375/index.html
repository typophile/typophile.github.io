However, there are some issues in the layout.
One should try to avoid paragraphs beginning at the top of columns.
That makes it too easy for the reader to skip text, and for instance begin at the top of the second column, rather than deal with the un-buffered jump from drop cap to text, which creates a semantic schism in the first word, exacerbated by the gutter-width gap between drop cap and body text.

<p>I am not sure, what you mean, partly because I am amateur and partly because of my English. Although I also feel, that there is something wrong with the layout, I had not been able to say, what is wrong there. It looks a bit, like the typographer followed a scheme, that he tried to follow, but it does not work in this case. It looks a bit strained.</p>
<p>Would you drag the headline to the left, spare the first column and the initial? And you would not resize the image? Because of the random allocation of the fat black letter block (the initial and the headline) and the white room on the right side of the headline?</p>
<p>By the way, I feel not good with the block between the second and the third columns of the right page. I cannot comprehend the sense of the line at the top. But that’s not all, which I am not able to get.</p>

<p>Right. The roots of contemporary H&amp;J systems go back to the work done by Zapf and others in the 1970s and 1980s, which were designed with text scaling in mind. Most fonts can handle 2–3 percent with no noticeable distortion. Some typefaces can handle more; Vialog was designed to distort 5% before it begins to show. Unfortunately many designers never use glyph scaling because they don’t read beyond the most basic books on typography which usually insist that scaling type is always criminal.</p>

<hr>
<p>With regard to the glyph spacing I will check with my laser printer, how dependent it is from the printing resolution. I belong to those ones, that never have heard before from professionals, that glyph scaling is anything else than criminal. I often was bothered by word spacings, that were too big, but I can’t remember, when I felt bothered by hyphenation. Very interesting thread. I have to experiment more with all these parameters. There are many combinations. (I once have set up a short text, in which I changed the letter spacing from line to line. Very carefully, manually and without a big jump of the letter spacing of the line, that directly has followed, although I had heard, that this should not be done. But it worked fine.)</p>

<p><cite>You don’t set text so that people admire how gray it is.</cite></p>
<p>Would you go a bit more into details with your criticism, please? I think, the aim of having no hyphenation is exaggerated, but the evenness of the word spacing also can be influenced by the slight glyph scaling in a way, that there are no big holes between words, in which the view falls. So the legibility is partly dependent from the gray of the text blocks, isn’t it? And then we would not admire the pure beauty, but the functionality (of the beauty). And for the case, that you don’t mean the micro typography, could you propose an alternate macro typography (an alternate layout)?</p>

<p>I second that question. And I add the question for German sources with regard to the H&amp;J system.</p>

<p>But there was no question of unlimited scaling, but 2–3 percent only. If the very slight distorsion is not recognized, but the word spacing is more even and without holes, the strict principle should be broken by the more important principle <em>legibility</em>. And your typefaces are probably never printed in exactly the same way, as they look in your font editor. Good is, what works. If I draw an image and make a mistake – squirting ink unintentionally for example – I always check, whether the image looks better with the mistake instead of trashing it at once. My aim is not the full control about everything, that I do, but the result. The result may be not perfect without the mistakes. But naturally you should not blindly trust in your mistakes. I don’t force me to make mistakes. <em>If then</em>, but not <em>then if</em>.</p>

<p>Dale Guild Typefoundry, has a nice account of their attempts to recast a full set of Gutenberg&rsquo;s 42-line bible type.</p>
<p>They ended up with 245 sorts.</p>
<p>They wrote:</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;The narrower letters were used to contract the length of a line and the wider ones to expand it. The space separating words remained constant.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;…the narrower or wider alternate characters were skillfully deployed to yield lines of identical optical width…&rdquo; (Kapr *) These are faulty conclusions. Either the wider or the narrower characters are alternates. As the textual use of the wider characters out-number the narrower ones by approximately 3 to 1, the latter must be considered the alternates. What usually makes these alternates narrower is the fact that they lack serifs on the left side. They are never used or omitted to shorten or lengthen the space required by a given number of characters within a line. Gutenberg had employed them in both his earlier founts, the Sibyllenbuch and the Donatus/Kalender, but none of the extant printed specimens used justified lines. Their inception and use is purely aesthetic. They do not represent consciously narrowed letterforms. These alternates were cut and cast to create tighter fitting of certain character combinations that produced too much white-space within words. The alternates (left side sans-serifs) always follow C, E, F, X, Y, c, e, f, g, r, t, x, and y.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see how. We just like to see things line up because it makes us feel in control. But in fact we&rsquo;re <em>losing</em> control of the reading experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>could you propose an alternate macro typography (an alternate layout)?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t use fonts, I just make &lsquo;em. :-)  But I don&rsquo;t mean to be flippant. I just know when something is wrong even if I&rsquo;m not sure how best to fix it. But one can certainly pay attention to good typographers who are also sensitive to the micro world of fonts; and certainly <em>not</em> Modernists who are obsessed with Regularity.</p>
<p>One simple thing I can comfortably recommend
though is this: learn to love the right rag.</p>
<p>And glyph scaling?! Maybe on a free font.
Not one that&rsquo;s been crafted carefully in every detail.</p>
<p>BTW, tracking is probably worse than glyph scaling!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you view today’s glyph scaling as the digital
equivalent to Gutenberg’s multiple glyphs?</p>

<p>No way.
Scaling is brutish. Alternate glyphs can be a great idea (although it&rsquo;s much more work) as long as it&rsquo;s done for the reader, not merely the viewer.</p>
<p>BTW, Gutenberg didn&rsquo;t do that because he had high ideals. He was simply imitating the scribes* (as Don says). He <em>had</em> to come as close as possible to appease the critics of printing.</p>
<ul>
<li>So why did <em>they</em> do it? Not sure.
Maybe because hyphenation was
seen as weak, hence unholy?</li>

<p>That’s true, but I try to consciously make use of my subconsciousness. If the view falls into holes, you are pulled out of the unconsciously reading process, aren’t you?

<p>No, it is not not absolutely true, it is wrong. A well crafted body text typeface might tolerate more mistreatment than a poorly crafted one. Might! And I assume, that the Indesign/Quark algorithms are not scaling all glyphs in all lines and all words; if they would, the scaling would be almost useless with regard to the evenness of the word spacing or the hyphenation. Nobody here said, that there should be established a general rule, that scaling is a good thing. James Puckett already wrote in the beginning, that <em>most</em> fonts can handle 2–3 percent with no noticeable distortion. I don’t know, how many are <em>most</em>, but for sure <em>most</em> is not the same as <em>all</em>. And we are talking about body text, but not about headlines, logos or any other text, that is set in big point sizes. We all have these deterrent examples in mind. But I know extreme examples set in big point sizes only. I never have tested scaling body text with 2–3 percent, neither globally nor with the Indesign algorithm.</p>
<p>But perhaps it is easier, if I illustrate the logic of your sentence in another way: Imagine two men. The one was born with two arms and legs, the usual condition. The other one was born with one arm and two legs. Would you say now, that the one-arm-man better can abandon his arm? In fact, you cannot conclude anything on this base, because it may be, that the one-arm-man is palsied.</p>
<p>Hehe, probably the illustration is harder to comprehend. But I don’t delete it.</p>

In fact that’s pretty rare, probably because it’s too much of

<p>But didn’t you mean the care, with which a font is made? You were regarding to the technical quality with the term <em>well-crafted</em>, but not to the (raw) design, weren’t you? If you mean the design, I agree with you, that there are well-crafted fonts, that are more robust than others. But if a font already is horizontally scaled with 2–3 percent by a dilettante typemaker, the user would move it into the recognizable (by the subconsciousness) extreme, if he additionally would scale it horizontally. (In the same way as you loose information with every analog copy.) So the typedesigner should not say: ‘I don’t craft my fonts well, because the users don’t handle them well.’ This would be a defiance reaction.</p>

<p>True.</p>
<p>But what I was saying is: somebody who thinks it&rsquo;s OK to scale fonts also thinks it&rsquo;s OK not to worry about small details at the letterform level.</p>
<p>And going back in the discussion, to something more practical: don&rsquo;t scale fonts, not merely because some type designers mind small details, but because you can assume that the type designer of the font at hand minded the small details* and a simple horizontal scaling will do more harm than good (especially if the goal is a Modernist succubus).</p>
<ul>
<li>Otherwise you should be using a font where that&rsquo;s the case.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to scale type, learn how to do it well at the type design level, and maybe use OT for width alternates (assuming the EULA of the font you&rsquo;re using allows &ldquo;internal&rdquo; modification*). Don&rsquo;t just hit 103% in InDesign.</p>

No way.
Scaling is brutish. Alternate glyphs can be a great idea (although it’s much more work) as long as it’s done for the reader, not merely the viewer.
</cite>
I agree. 
<cite>
BTW, Gutenberg didn’t do that because he had high ideals. He was simply imitating the scribes* (as Don says). He had to come as close as possible to appease the critics of printing.
</cite>
But the scribes weren't producing texts with columns as tidily justified as Gutenberg's. I agree that Gutenberg's  multiple glyphs enabled his texts to look more natural, but I do believe that the number of alternate glyphs and ligatures were also created so he could achieve a strict justified column with even word spacing. As pointed out <a href="http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/educator/modules/gutenberg/invention/familiar/">here</a>, the strict justified columns are one of the ways scholars distinguish Johann's work from manuscripts. So, it appears that the even columns and spacing in his work were not part part of his goal of imitating the scribes. 
<p>From the above link:<cite>
One way to distinguish between Gutenberg&rsquo;s printed Bible and a manuscript Bible is that in the printed book, all lines of text are brought to equal length in the column, forming justified lines. The strictly justified lines of Gutenberg&rsquo;s Bible were considered by some to be superior to the slightly uneven lines of a manuscript Bible. 
</cite></p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m against scaling glyphs <em>and</em> spaces. I was taught by a thoughtful typographer that doing so was to butcher the balance and detail put into the font by the type designer. (Not to mention the readability issues). But practically speaking, I&rsquo;d wager most typographers, book designers publication designers and graphic designers in general don&rsquo;t have the skill (Or the time. As you pointed out, it&rsquo;s much more work) to scale type at the type design level.</p>

<p>I wonder, whether really all of you, that insist in the strict rule, have tested the <strong>slight</strong> glyph scaling in body text. I mean the algorithms of Quark XPress and Indesign. I did not test it. But maybe I am coming to the same result.</p>
<p>I think, there is one thing, that you forget, when you talk about well-crafted fonts. The very most body text fonts don’t have optical styles. And almost nobody of you typedesigners tell the potential customers on your websites, under which printing circumstances and in which point sizes your fonts should be used.</p>
<p>Typetogether writes about Athelas: &ldquo;Athelas also takes advantage of the great advances and technical developments made in offset printing.&rdquo; Nevertheless <strong><a href="http://www.type-together.com/index.php?action=portal/viewContent&cntId_content=2682&id_section=146">the letterpress print of Athelas</a></strong> seems to work. And it really looks dark in the letterpress print (and probably lower contrasted).</p>
<p>I own a book, that is printed in Stempel Garamond. A dirty print in my opinion, because on the one page the text is relatively thin and on the other really fat. In other words, on one of the pages the original outline does not match with the printed outline. Nevertheless I enjoy reading it. It is very legible.</p>
<p>What would you think, if the user enbolds one of your well-crafted fonts? Is the digital version of Stempel Garamond well-crafted? It is not the same as scaling, I know, but probably it is also not that, what you have wished, when you have designed your typefaces.</p>

<p>On screen we probably have to take the hinting into account. I doubt, that the differences can be estimated on screen. Did you print it out? And I think, that also a column should belong to the test, in which all glyphs are scaled, because I assume, that the probability, that the differences can be noticed, is higher then.</p>
<p>But to which conclusion did you come with regard to the distorsion of glyphs?</p>

I printed out that page, and personally, can&rsquo;t see any noticeable distortions, while the benefit in tight spots (like extremely narrow columns and unusually long words) seems to be pretty obvious. I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t use this when setting in a comfortable measure, but can see myself resorting to this trick when all else fails.</p>
<p>In the days of metal type, glyphs-scaling (or rather squeezing) was rightfully frowned upon as it damaged the type (and could potentially crack up the chase,) but in our illustrious age&hellip;seems a tad less criminal.</p>

<p>Sure.
This is not a religion - everything has its usefulness.</p>
<p>BTW, who told you that metal type can be squeezed? The most you can do is file the sidebearings (and not just flatly - you would even take chunks off to accomodate kerning). But that wasn&rsquo;t really frowned upon. In fact my letterpress teacher (our Gerald Lange) once told me that you could tell how good a printer was by looking at how much filing was evident on his fonts!</p>

There is a reason, why people in composting rooms carried mallets. Hastily and badly crafted forms can be hammered into the chase under pressure, as improperly justified lines get squeezed by a few millimeters when the quoins are tightened. These forms, were always in danger of bursting in a little shower of lead, so the form makers sometimes poured beer on the underside to help sorts stick together. &ldquo;Just a thimble full for the comp&rdquo; - as it was called.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great old song:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twas a busy day in the print shop, with orders coming in fast.
The stoneman, in a frightful stew, was harried and harassed
When up to the stone came a pressman with an injured look on his pan
He started to sing his song of woes as only a pressman can.
&ldquo;That form&rsquo;s the bunk. The lockup&rsquo;s poor. The corners don&rsquo;t even meet.
The leads and slugs are bastard, and the type is off its feet.
The cuts are warped and rock like hell; the furniture is sprung.
The quoins are all ass-backward and the type&rsquo;s filled up with dung.
I&rsquo;ve done my best, used all my kinks, but it won&rsquo;t take the hint;
For two whole days I&rsquo;ve sweated blood and I can&rsquo;t make it print.
The stoneman heaved a mighty sigh, his eyes a glassy stare.
He threw away his mallet as he wildly tore his hair.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hammered and you&rsquo;ve battered like a blacksmith on a drunk.
You&rsquo;ve filled it up with cardboard and other kinds of junk.
You&rsquo;ve pounded down the work-ups and you&rsquo;ve nailed them with a tack.
You&rsquo;ve turned the damn thing upside-down and daubed it with shellac.
You&rsquo;ve screwed it up in every way that&rsquo;s known from A to Z.
And now that it&rsquo;s a dreadful mess you bring your grief to me.
That form left here in tip-top shape, the lockup was the class.
Now you can take the gosh-darned thing and shove it up your&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early implementations of microtypographic extensions for TeX explicitly allowed one to specify, in cases where a multiple master width-axis for a font was available, different designs in place of glyph scaling. The general feeling though is that it isn&rsquo;t worth the effort; unless the printing is being done to very high standards it&rsquo;s  difficult to discern glyph scaling of less than 2% [try having your masterpiece printed on low quality paper and see how <em> that</em> effect overwhelms everything else — I speak from bitter (recent) experience.]</p>

<p>Tolbert Lanston invented a system of justification by variable letterspacing, for the Monotype machine, in the early twentieth century.
This produced an appearance akin to the default that Quark introduced in the late 1980s. However, while Quark&rsquo;s method was accepted willy-nilly, foisted upon the industry as a fait accompli, Lanston&rsquo;s innovation was roundly dismissed and never made it to production. People preferred the large variation in word space they were used to, rather than a general watering-down of colour.

<p>If we would talk about art, but not about typography, which is not necessarily art and which often should not be art, I would say, that you should give your best, even if nobody else than you recognizes it. In case of design you normally have jobs on demand, where a rational relation between money and invested energy must exist. But Indesign has an automatism for the margin kerning, as far as I remember. <em>Margin kerning</em> means <em>Randausgleich</em> in German, doesn’t it? So I assume, that you would not loose much time, if you make use of the automatism, and you could use it independent from the question, whether you make art or design.</p>
<p>And you already spoke out the truth: ‘But we don’t read with our consciousness.’</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It might be noted that in the case of glyph scaling by 2 or 3 percent, the scaling, of course, affects the width of vertical strokes. When the individual characters of a typeface are modified to fit within the constraint of something like the Monotype 18-unit system, the width of the vertical strokes would stay the same - and so it is reasonable to suspect that the scaling of 5 or 6 percent that this might lead to (changing 9.5 units to 9 or 10 units) would also be hard to notice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Gerard Unger, Wie man’s liest (While you are reading), chapter 19, ninth paragraph:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In kurzen Zeilen stehen Typografie und Sprache in einem sehr gespannten Verhältnis zueinander – große Wortzwischenräume sind keine Seltenheit. Mit einem sehr kleinen Schriftgrad, durch den mehr Zeichen in eine Zeile passen, ist man die Probleme los. Aber das ist meistens keine gangbare Lösung, weil die Leser damit nicht so glücklich sind. Mit guter Software kann man Text einbringen und austreiben: die Buchstaben ein bisschen <strong>breiter</strong> oder größer, ein wenig mehr Laufweite – oder umgekehrt kleinere und <strong>schmälere</strong> Buchstaben, ein bisschen unterschnitten. <strong>Wenn der Zeilenausgleich sich aus drei Faktoren zusammensetzt und nicht nur aus einem</strong> (zum Beispiel auschließlich Spationieren), <strong>merkt der Leser in der Regel nichts davon.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>As far as this was not mistranslated, <strong>breiter/schmäler (broader/narrower)</strong> means glyph scaling. If anybody has the English or the original edition, please post that paragraph in English or Dutch.</p>
<p>And although I agree with hrant, that reading is an unconscious process, there is one thing, about which I meanwhile stumble: If the difference between the scaled text and the normal text is not visible, although you <em>search</em> for differences (an conscious process, and I would accept, if the test persons only can say, with which sample they <em>feel</em> better, but in a blind test [a funny expression in this context]), I doubt, that it can be recognized with the subconsciousness. Again, I am talking about a direct comparison. And I think, that it had to be examined in a scientific way. Most of the criticism of glyph scaling, that I found here, was pure belief.</p>
<p>(In this context it also is interesting, what Unger writes about the way, in which letters are recognized – with the help of specific characteristics. This means, that the brain does not compare the letter, that a person sees, with all images of letters, that are stored in the brain. The way, in which the brain filters the letter, is interlaced.)</p>

<p>I agree with both of your points. But obviously the brain can recognize letters, set in different typefaces. Why? Because there is no fixed image of the letters stored in the brain, but the specific characteristics of the letters.</p>
<p>I assume, that there are two requirements for the non-attention of scaled glyphs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The difference between the scaled and the normal glyphs must not be so big, that it gets through the consciousness. This kind of difference would be a change of things, that are not characteristic for the specific shape of the letter (of the used typeface), the color for example and also the visible change, that is caused by glyph scaling. It is hard to explain, what I mean. There is unconscious reading on the one side and conscious viewing on the other side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scaling must not change the specific characteristics of the letters: If a p is horizontally scaled too much, the descender would become unvisible. (In this context it is interesting, that the bottom serif would partly preserve the descender and therefore one of the specific characteristics of the letter p.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a nice anecdote in <em>While you are reading</em>: A designer creates an unusual ligature and asks different persons, if they can see, what it means. The answers go in this direction: It is &ldquo;correct answer&rdquo;, but I have doubts, that it can be easily recognized. In other words, all of them have recognized it, but they have doubts (about their own abilities or the abilities of other readers). Those things happen, if you don’t make blind tests. (I hope, that I have not misinterpreted the anecdote now, but I am too lazy for searching for it at the moment.)</p>
<p>Edited:</p>
<p>I assume, that in times of individuality – and typeface designers know about their individuality very well in my opinion – people have a tendency not to use themselves as yardstick. Sometimes they stumble over their own intellect. I am trying to give an example: &ldquo;If I were not me, then I would be totally different.&rdquo; But aren’t there more similarities than differences between human individuals? I mean, if the expert, the typeface designer, would be unable to recognize the difference between the scaled and the normal glyph, what does make him so sure, that the non expert is able to recognize the difference? May it be, that the knowledge about the human psychology plays a trick on us here?</p>
<p>Edited:</p>
<p>Thanks for the English version, Craig!</p>

<p>This is also why ragged right is seldom used, except in publications with an avant-garde look, or where justification would require retyping the text, because of the ancient or inexpensive equipment used. The scribes Gutenberg imitated justified their pages on both sides, and if that was even good enough for Aldus Manutilus, it ought to be good enough for everyone else!</p>
<p>Eventually, with digital typography, someone is going to think of designing a new font format, to succeed TrueType and Type 1, wherein some portions of the letter can be defined as flexible&hellip; so that, for example, the letter H might be scaled horizontally by lengthening or shortening the bar in the middle without changing the width of the vertical strokes.</p>
<p>And word processors might be more advanced, so that one could specify not just limits, but weightings, and even curves&hellip; so that one could say that optical scaling below 0.5% has a low cost, but above that a high cost, and similarly with letterspacing - so that instead of one taking place only where the limit for the other is reached, both would be done gradually in the ratio specified by the text composer. Predefined glyph reshaping would come before optical scaling.</p>

<p>One thing I find is that different fonts - at a given size - seem to &ldquo;like&rdquo; certain column widths. Once having chosen a font, finding those &ldquo;sweet spots&rdquo; in width makes everything go much, much smoother.
Unfortunately, the current practice in web design is to choose a pre-defined layout with pre-chosen widths and then finding an acceptable way to stuff the text inside those widths.</p>
