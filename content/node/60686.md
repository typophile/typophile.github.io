  body: "\"You can run it at the command line.\"\r\n\r\nBut probably not on a native
    Windows.\r\n\r\nMy batch scripts (Windows):\r\n\r\n<code>@echo off\r\ncall FDKvars\r\ncopy
    Input\\*.* Output\r\ncd %FDK%\r\nfor %%f in (%~dp0Output\\*.otf; %~dp0Output\\*.pfb;
    %~dp0Output\\*.pfa) do %autohintCom% -q -a \"%%f\"</code>\r\n\r\nWhile FDKvars.bat
    is:\r\n\r\n<code>@echo off\r\nset \"FDK=C:\\FDK_25_21898\\Tools\\win\"\r\nset
    \"autohintCom=autohint.cmd\"\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe folder, that contains the two
    batch files, must also contain the folders \"Input\" and \"Output\".\r\n\r\nI
    have created the FDKvars.bat, because now I only have to make slight corrections
    in that file, when Adobe updates the FDK. And I renamed the folder FDK to FDK_25_21898,
    because I am using three versions of the FDK at the moment.\r\n\r\n<strong>paragraph</strong>\r\n\r\nRemember
    to deactivate the FLS option \"Use subroutines to compress outlines in CFF table\".\r\n\r\n\"Also,
    should I always run it with the -a switch to replace the FLS5 hints altogether?\"\r\n\r\nWell,
    I prefer to remove all hints in FLS, before I autohint a font, but if you don\u2019t
    remove them, it should be the -r option, shouldn\u2019t it? I am not sure at the
    moment, because the autohint help says \"has effect only, if the history file
    is being used.\""
