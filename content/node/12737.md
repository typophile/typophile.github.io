    Bold Condensed</a> to me.\r\n\r\nIf the match isn't absolutely exact it might
    be because there are different versions of Futura out there and the paper may
    have had its own headline font drawn.\r\n\r\n"

    Sun font is Tempo Heavy Condensed.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know what that National
    Post font is? Or something really close to it?"
