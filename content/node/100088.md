body: "hello again. Fascinated by the dilletante way of some applications. I started
  a documentation of these adhesive letters. You can find them often used in France
  and Italy for bars, wash saloons, restaurants or gas stations. Does any body knows
  if there already exists a digital version of it. Or something quite similar? \u2013
  thx in advance for support.\r\nAlexander Colby"

  body: "FYI: <em>Foto0024.jpg</em> is not the same typeface as the others. As for
    the rest, the typeface is probably proprietary to the vinyl letter manufacturer:
    I don\u2019t think that any self-respecting type designer would claim it as his
    or her own\u2026"

  body: "... true the Foto0024.jpg is not a great example, but even here you can find
    the three letters \xBBZ\xAB, \xBBH\xAB and \xBBU\xAB which are from the typeface
    I'm looking for.\r\nAlso you think it would may be self-disrespecting to do so,
    but would it be legal to digitalize this typeface even if it's proprietary to
    the vinyl letter manufacturer?"
