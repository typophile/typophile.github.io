  time now, and I don't know why, the .ai files are not associated with Illustrator.
  I already reinstalled the whole Suite and nothing. \r\nApparently if I drag a file
  into Illustrator it opens, but it's just boring. I want this to work properly. \r\nI'm
  just loosing patience here.\r\nSome help would be appreciated :).\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJo\xE3o\r\n\r\nP.S.:
  I know this is no typophile like issue, but I have no patience to google."

    Yes I'll probably try that, but later :) I'll post the result, and thanks for
    the tip :)

  body: "Ah, no. It ought to work (probably), but you can first try manually changing
    the association.\r\n\r\nIn HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, \".ai\" points to a default handler
    for \"Adobe.Illustrator.13\". This key, in turn, contains all necessary Explorer
    information -- eg., the icon to use, but also the Shell stuff (as in \"Open\",\"Print\").\r\nThe
    Shell subkey there contains a subkey \"open\", which <em>then</em> has a subkey
    \"command\", and this is finally the one to edit. Its value \"(Default)\" should
    read -- <em>including the quotes</em>\r\n\r\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe
    Illustrator CS3\\Support Files\\Contents\\Windows\\Illustrator.exe\" \"%1\"\r\n\r\n--
    but note that this is the path on my system, and yours is highly likely different."

  body: "There is a slight difference with my setup (Win XP). In mine, the primary
    key \".ai\" (which is picked up by the system as the file extension -- oui, mon
    fier Mac amices, that's how Windows' file system works!). That contains another
    definition as default: \"Adobe.Illustrator.13\u201D -- and <em>that</em> is the
    name of another key further down the list, with all details. I think you should
    leave the key you just changed to \"Adobe.Illustrator.13\".\r\n\r\n.. Oh well,
    there is also the possiblity it's all changed with Win 7."
