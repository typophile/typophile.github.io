body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!\r\nBelow are two images of the front and
  back of a chocolate box I recently picked up in New Zealand. \r\nI am curios of
  the the typeface itself. I understand there are multiple effects (and distracting
  lines) but the sans-seif typeface inside the angled effects is what eludes me. \r\n\r\nThe
  face has very straight and harsh edges (hard to see with rounded effects and image
  quality) and an interesting C, R and D.\r\n\r\n [[http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/705/photoon20111023at2307.jpg/|Victory

  body: "Thanks Mike, \r\n\r\nI've looked into the family, is it me or does the x-height
    seem lower in the posted reference?\r\nI definitely appreciate your point in the
    direction, and perhaps that is indeed the typeface. \r\nI suppose it's always
    a never ending search!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n~Dylan Jones"
