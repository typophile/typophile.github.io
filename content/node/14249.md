    me. What offends me is: The girl, 25 who was leaving the day camp taking 5 kids
    home going 107mph on back roads and plowing into a garbage truck killing everyone,
    now that offends me.'

  body: Relax, man. Hrant can be arrogant and steps on a lot of toes in defending
    his positions on type and politics, but so what? At least he doesn't deny it.
    Every forum has a few provocative people. Hrant is head and shoulders above the
    standard, he knows his stuff and he's one of the few willing to consistently post
    in the critique section. True, he picks fights with other strong personalities
    such as Nick, but so what? Leaving just means the voices you don't like will grow
    stronger. And ditto what Norbert said. You've been a regular member for nearly
    3 years and this is your fourth post, why even bother announcing you are leaving?
    Why not just email the admins and ask them to nix your account? Or just stop visiting?

    for is that you'd express your opinions <strong>in spite of</strong> or even <strong>because
    of</strong> Hrant.\r\n\r\n<em>...he picks fights with other strong personalities
    such as Nick, but so what? </em>\r\n\r\nThis is not a \"so what\" scenario. It
    sucks and Hrant knows it.\r\n\r\n<em>Leaving just means the voices you don\u2019t
    like will grow stronger.</em> \r\n\r\nThis is the absolute truth, and it's why
    I hope you'll stick around and contribute, rather than just lurking and remaining
    disappointed."

    cyberhypnotist now?\r\n\r\nYou, Jared and everybody else here are enablers of
    a great community. Be proud of that. Nobody should get angry because they can't
    control the nature of the beast - that just weakens <strong>you</strong>. Control
    is over-rated.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the f*ck does that even mean?\r\n\r\nThe question is who contributes more to this
    community than Mr. Papazian? For the life of me I really can't understand why
    people are so bothered by Hrant. Is it insecurity, or what?\r\n\r\nIf you don't
    like it, leave. It's that simple. I have enjoyed Hrants commentary, as well as
    Nick's comments."

  body: "In reading fontsoldat's (Mathias') critique thread, I wonder if there's a
    misunderstanding caused by a language barrier. If so, it's an unfortunate misunderstanding
    since Hrant and Norbert both give positive encouragement for an interesting set
    of dingbats. \r\n\r\nMathias, if you're reading this, you should know that Hrant
    and Norbert's compliments are sincere. I don't question Hrant's sincerity, even
    though I sometimes question his approach.\r\n\r\nHrant, don't be surprised that
    I mentioned you by name. I'm responding to Mathias' grief and grod's reply. Of
    course you are not the whole community, but it's an easy mistake since you're
    the most outspoken.\r\n"

    offense was meant, I appreciate the time you've taken to help me as I try to learn
    this crazy craft/art of type design and I almost always learn something new from
    your comments across the board. \r\n\r\nJoe et al. I was merely acknowledging
    that his outspokenness is frustrating to some and discouraging to others. The
    critique section would be near dead without his input."

    'better' is isn't always something we agree on. Party on dudes!

    people to create something which is larger than themselves. This in turn implies
    that we need to all get along or it isn't going to work. If someone wants to leave,
    as sad as it might be, we need to allow them that option without being rude about
    it. Be the bigger person. How can we possibly know everything? I've noticed that
    communicating online (ichat, email) removes the most important part of communication
