    work very well. Like Caecilia, some of deGroot&#39;s stuff, even Georgia. <BR>

    about helvetica and overused fonts. As I said, I&#39;m not very experienced in
    the use of type &#40;not alot was required thoughout my education in design&#41;.
    I&#39;m a fan of swiss page layout and design. Do you have any reading suggestions?  '

    fan of Caecilia&#39;s functionality, I recently set my  <BR>PDF portfolio in it&#39;s
    entirety in this little workhorse. I  <BR>very much enjoyed the results &#40;very
    readable with a  <BR>touch of character&#41; and have received complements  <BR>from
    some of the few firms who received it thus far.  <BR>the availability of text
    figures in the standard font &#40;ie,  <BR>no search&amp;replace for numerals&#41;
    and well proportioned  <BR>small caps is a big part of the appeal for me.
