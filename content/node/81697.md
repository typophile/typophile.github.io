  body: "I have too, and with no luck. It looks like an amateur font, because the
    letters don't  track very well, but I failed to locate it at either Dafont or
    Abstractfonts, the two places I usually look when I suspect a freebie origin.\r\n\r\nIt
    suggests that I looked in the wrong places, or maybe this is a custom effort by
    someone that may not be a professional type designer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thanks Mike, I've seen it enough places that I know it isn't custom.  I don't
    think it is a freebie either.
