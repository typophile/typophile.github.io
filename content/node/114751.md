  body: "Just need some help to find the best match for this manuscript font.\r\nThe
    original painting faded, so I \"enhanced\" it with a chalk pen.\r\nTrouble is
    the Princess font (nice match) has a different 'C' and I wonder if there is a
    better option.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Although with your enhancement I can't tell how the original font looks like,
    you may like the following font:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Belinda-type67_6302.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    have the following names for this font (but they are probably clones - not the
    original font):\r\n<strong>\"Belinda\"</strong> or <strong>\"BelindaType67\"</strong>
    \ (1994, ImageLine Incorporated)\r\n<strong>Elizabeth Semi-Script</strong> (1994,
    CompuWorks)\r\n\r\nIf somebody can dig deeper than me and find the original font
    name, your are welcome :)"
