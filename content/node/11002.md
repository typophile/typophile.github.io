  body: ' Beautiful. It has a nice Bayer flavor. It&#39;s a  <BR>rare gem of a bitmap
    where multiple sizes and  <BR>weights feel like a cohesive family. <BR> <BR>The
    U and V seem very close. Perhaps the U needs  <BR>a stem. <BR> <BR>I see you&#39;re
    using Verdana-like widths for  <BR>the &#39;regular&#39; weight--great for readability.
    The  <BR>&#39;thin&#39; set is very nice. As much as I like  <BR>Verdana, I&#39;ve
    often wished it had a more elegant  <BR>set, that wasn&#39;t so clunky &#40;New
    Yorker&#39;s would  <BR>say horsey&#41; at 11pt. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to see
    a text setting... even if it&#39;s in  <BR>French. <BR> <BR>My humble plea: sell
    this to Microsoft so  <BR>they can distribute it freely with their browser.  <BR>It
    would make the Web a much better place. '
