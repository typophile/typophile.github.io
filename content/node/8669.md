body: 'Hi all, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on my own identity and decided to challenge
  myself with my first script signature. <BR>I initially drew this and then scanned
  and traced it. It directly translates to &#34;In the wind&#34; which is something
  I wanted to show in the typography. <BR> <BR>I have a few things in mind that I
  think need to be fixed: <BR>-I dont think the weight is consitent, I am wondering
  where I should thicken or thin, I think I should aim for thicker since it will be
  used as a logo. I think my first letters work better. <BR>-I&#39;m not sure about
  the thickness of the l to the right, is my t too thin? etc, etc. <BR>-Should I keep
  a flexible baseline? <BR> <BR> <BR>I&#39;d appreciate any input you can give me.
  <BR>I attached both .jpg and .swf files. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your time, <BR>Emilie

  body: 'Here is an update, <BR> <BR>I wasn&#39;t sure at first about Paul&#39;s comment
    &#40;in the handwriting thread&#41; for thinning but after messing with it, I
    was more convinced. I think it will help improve legibility at small sizes which
    is nice. I worked on thinning the letters and getting more uniformity with my
    thick and thins, baseline and heights. I also tried to change the s a bit so it
    wouldn&#39;t look like a &#34;y&#34; &#40;got the comment from 2 people now&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I know this needs more work, any other pointers would be very appreciated

  body: 'Maybe I&#39;m odd &#40;OK, yeah, right: maybe!&#41;, but I think the thick-thin
    in the first example gives it character. The new version looks more sterile to
    me &#40;although the -s is better&#41;.'

  body: I have same opinion as Steve. &#34;s&#34; is improved and noew looks less
    &#34;y&#34;ish. The thicker / varied strokes looks nicer to me, although it does
    seem more legible now. Humm, what to do...

  body: I&#39;m going to throw in my symbol for critique as well. Here is 2 jpgs,
    one with thinner type and one with bolder type &#40;my first version that is not
    reworked&#41;. Fyi, I didn&#39;t really put any time into positioning for the
    symbol, just put them next to each other. <BR> <BR>Here is my issue, I like both
    things seperately but I&#39;m not sure if they fit together anymore! Of course
    I could rework the symbol to try make it fit more with the type. I like the contrast
    straight-pointy/curve-smooth, at the same time I wonder it is really beneficial
    to the overall aspect. <BR> <BR>I feel the symbol is crushing the light type but
    I think the light type looks more sophisticated and legible in small... <BR> <BR>Any
    thoughts? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/63077.jpg"

  body: I like that last direction of softening the wave. I think you&#39;ll need
    to open up that highlight on the boat, at least for small applications. <BR> <BR>I
    prefer the weightier stroke. You just need to raise the lower &#34;s&#34; curve
    &#40;might require pushing it out a little too&#41; so that it doesn&#39;t dip
    so far below the baseline

  body: What about putting the type and symbol together? Does anyone else feel it
    might not be the best combination? It was fine when I did it on paper but I don&#39;t
    feel it as much now that it&#39;s all traced and clean. I&#39;m wondering if I
    should let one or the other fall and try for other options.

  body: There is a lot of contrast between the type &#40;orgainc, flowing, handmade,
    airy&#41;, and the symbol &#40;solid, square, heavy, geometric&#41;. I dont really
    know what this logo is for, but you might try a symbol that is graphically more
    consistent with the type... or a symbol that is conceptually more consistent with
    the name.

  body: The symbol doesn&#39;t really support the text. Is it a yacht &#40;as in the
    wind would lead me to suppose&#41;? The waves in the first symbol also made me
    feel the boat was going away from the viewer. As Kemie noted the boat might be
    improved by painting it with a loose brush and don&#39;t be too scrupulous about
    cleaning up the digitisation. The heavier text is my preferred option and the
    changes Scott proposed for the s would help, however I think in the process of
    cleaning up your sketch you have lost the spontaneity of the original. The a might
    be better with a loop at the top where it connects to the D and similarly the
    top of the s and the first n. <BR>Tim

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>When my symbol was first handsketched, I felt
    it good. It is a boat but I meant it to be a paper boat &#40;fits better with
    the name that way&#41;. I tried opening it by doing it with strokes instead of
    a full mass but was not satisfied, although I should probably give it another
    shot. <BR> <BR>The identity is for me, I&#39;m a freelance graphic designer. In
    a way, I&#39;m almost thinking that if I simply scanned my sketch or reworked
    it with watercolor, it would look much better. What are your feelings about using
    a logo that is not made of vectors in my situation? <BR> <BR>Time to take out
    the brushes and ink I believe... <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Emilie

    at a high resolution. Computers can be so limiting. <BR>Tim
