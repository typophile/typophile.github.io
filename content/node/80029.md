body: "Firstly, let me preface the post by saying that I am a complete newbie at everything
  pertaining to fonts, type, css or design, so please, be gentle.\r\n\r\nThe story
  thus far is as follows:\r\n\r\nI'm designing a web page for a few friends (and myself),
  so that we have something (anything) online until our organisation has the funding
  to get a better page up and running. Luckily, I'm not doing the coding, a friend
  of mine is.\r\n\r\nAs I rushed into things, I skimmed the legality of using Adobe
  Helvetica LT Bold embedded in the code. As far as I could see, Adobe hadn't given
  a real answer in their forums, but the users were advocating that it was borderline,
  but legal; hence I thought I'd be in the clear. After designing the mock-up, I read
  some more, and it seems their license does not include web embedding. Tough luck,
  as I'm forced to get another similar font, which is where the Nimbus Sans comes
  into play. As I understand it, they allow usage on web pages (a confirmation from
  any of you would be great).\r\n\r\nNow, my friend has already started to translate
  the design into code, but after a short conversation on why everything looks like
  absolute rubbish (where I suggest it's because the text uses hinting), he says that
  hinting is done per OS, and that he doesn't know of any way to fix this in the code.\r\n\r\nNow,
  when I say \"rubbish\", I mean the letters are all over the place (overlapping each
  other), and they seem to have lost any semblance of AA. Blind persons and people
  who are completely deranged might say that they look \"sharper\". I would very much
  like to hit these individuals over the head with the largest fish I could possibly
  wield as a weapon.\r\n\r\nBefore I shell out the \u20AC60 on the needed Nimbus Sans
  fonts, can any of you tell me if (1) the Nimbus Sans Bold and Nimbus Sans Bold Italic
  are comparable to Adobe Helvetica LT Bold and Adobe Helvetica LT Bold Oblique to
  the point that I won't have to do over the whole design because of size/design differences;
  (2) if hinting is indeed the issue; and (3) if hinting (and maybe even other things
  like kerning) can be forced off with things like @font-face, making the font actually
  readable and looking like it has AA (in browsers like Opera/FF/Chrome/Safari \u2014
  I couldn't care less about IE)?\r\n\r\nBasically, can I get the fonts from URW++
  and make the text in my web page look like the original design, or have I completely
  overestimated the status of web design and fonts, and need to wait another few decades
  before I can base a web site on anything other than Times New Roman and Arial?"

  body: "I appreciate the suggestion, but I've already tried Arimo, and quite frankly,
    it didn't look much like Helvetica. Using Arial or anything that might bear a
    slight semblance to Helvetica will not work either, as the whole design is based
    off both the shapes and sizes of Helvetica.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the \"free\"
    Nimbus Sans link, though, I'm currently testing it right now, and I've run into
    another problem. Namely ClearType.\r\n\r\nThe font looks perfect in Linux, but
    in both Win7 and WinXP, ClearType botches up the AA something fierce at under
    13 px size (at 13 and over it looks fine, but not perfect). \r\n\r\nAfter I was
    able to remove hinting and kerning, it does look a lot better, though, on both
    Linux and Win7/WinXP. I haven't been able to test OSX, yet, but I trust the sub-pixel
    rendering solution Apple has chosen is superior to ClearType (as they don't historically
    haven't ignored how type looks).\r\n\r\nAs it is quite late here, I can't continue
    with my experiments, but I am currently looking at trying to re-enabling kerning
    to get rid of the AA bugs. I will update tomorrow with results.\r\n\r\nAlso, line
    spacing seems completely different from Adobe Helvetica LT Bold to Nimbus Sans
    Bold, but that might be related to formats (used OpenType for the former and PFB
    for the latter). The fonts place themselves differently in text boxes, and there
    is differences in values between the lines that I can't seem to match. This won't
    be a huge issue, though; it just annoys me."

  body: "Your first post is very confusing. I think you might've misunderstood what
    hinting is and can do. Hinting Give \"hints\" to the rendering engine (in the
    browser or in the OS, depending on setup) about how the curves should be translated
    to pixels at low resolution. In the standard rendering mode which is default in
    Win XP the engine make use of different shades of grey. At small sizes, many <em>font
    files</em> override this use of greys to produce sharper text with b/w rendering
    only. These settings are default in Fontlab. If the fonts aren't hinted, they'll
    most probably look like shit under these conditions. Only very few fonts hold
    up very well: the web safe fonts. It takes months, maybe even years, to produce
    hinting like that of Verdana and Georgia.\r\n\r\nI'm far from an exert on these
    matters, so please correct me if I'm wrong."

    will help (unless there are other Helvetica clones there that look as good as
    Nimbus Sans and renders differently without hinting at 12 px size).\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Your
    first post is very confusing. I think you might've misunderstood what hinting
    is and can do.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI'm pretty confident I haven't, and it would
    help if you pointed out what was confusing about the post. It was made before
    I read up on things, by the way, I was just assuming things. There is no need
    for explanation of the technicalities right now, really.\r\n\r\nThe situation
    right now is that I've used PFB files, converted them to TrueType for web use.
    I've removed hinting and kerning information via the converter (which probably
    weren't there in the first place, as PFB doesn't contain this information, as
    far as I know), and I've basically settled for using a size 13 version of the
    font, because that's the only size that looks OK with the Windows sub-pixel rendering
    engine (ClearType). The only real issue is that some of the capital letters are
    missing a few pixels. I think I can live with that.\r\n\r\nIf only MS could make
    their Windows sub-pixel rendering work like in every other OS, this wouldn't have
    been a problem at all, and we could have had pretty much perfect rendering of
    all fonts. I haven't seen any case of hinting that made any font look better.
    As far as I'm concerned, hinting is completely useless for web (unless it's in
    combination with the so-called web safe fonts)."

    The resolution is nowhere near even the worst print conditions. Hence hinting.
    At larger sizes, hinting probably won't make any difference anyway. If your 16px

    enlarged text settings, or pinch zoom my touchscreen?

    Hence hinting.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNo, hence sub-pixel rendering to make up for
    the lost resolution. Hinting is about added readability. Sure, the problem is
    basically the same, but the difference is that hinting is about adding or subtracting
    form (via controlling interpolated areas), sub-pixel rendering is about interpolating
    all data. Hinting destroys the type entirely. Sub-pixel rendering (done right)
    is basically proper AA.\r\n\r\nPlease read my posts. I am not after readability,
    the text is clear as day. I want the type on the site to be closer to the original
    type. Hinting does not do that, it decays it further, for crying out loud, with
    hinting it's not even remotely readable.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>If your 16px type
    looks swell and fine hintless, what happens when I come marching with my enlarged
    text settings, or pinch zoom my touchscreen?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt will use a
    larger type and look even better?\r\n\r\nAlso, iOS and other devices typically
    use other formats, haven't looked into that yet, but I'm generally not too worried
    about Apple devices. Android might be another story. Then again, if we are to
    include hand held devices, the site would be better off with an own simple version.
    After all, it's just a site for publishing essays.\r\n\r\nI will check out the
    hinting data of the Nimbus Sans, though, Jens, but I can't imagine how it will
    ever make it better. Like I said, I all but solved it with moving to 13 px; as
    in, it's very nearly a perfect replication of how it looks in the mock-up (sans
    a few pixels). If the hinting data manages to fix those pixels, and at the same
    time not fuck up anything else, I'll eat my boots."
