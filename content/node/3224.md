body: 'Hi People; I&#39;m working on a CD reissue of Deep Purple&#39;s EMI UK album
  Burn, issued in 1974. That year someone used a commercial typeface for a band logo
  for posters, tour prog etc. &#40;though it didn&#39;t appear on the LP&#41;. The
  logo was then used on the next album Stormbringer &#40;1974&#41; and a live album
  Made In Europe &#40;1976&#41; - which also used the font extensively for the credits
  etc. <BR>I thought it was a Letragraphica font &#40;yes I&#39;m old enough to remember
  them!&#41; but enquiries there have drawn a blank &#40;though whether anyone there
  now was there 30 years ago is unlikely!&#41;. I&#39;ll add a copy of the logo but
  I&#39;ve seen it used in body copy without the outline, so this may have been added
  by the ad agency responsible. I appreciate any help anyone can give me. Simon<!--attachment:

  body: Actually, don&#39;t bother with the EPS, I just noticed it&#39;s an awful
    auto-trace.

  body: I&#39;m old enough to remember Letragraphica, too, but I&#39;ve never seen
    this typeface before &#40;if it is a typeface&#41;. The caps are similar to the
    old Letraset face <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/plaza-ef/" target="_blank">Plaza</a>,
    but it has no lowercase and it was released in 1975, a year later than the album.
    Perhaps Plaza was inspired by the typeface from the album? <BR> <BR>One other
    thing. In your sample, there are inconsistencies among some of the characters
    which suggests it may have been done by hand &#40;and not very well&#41;. This
    doesn&#39;t rule out the existence of a font, though.
