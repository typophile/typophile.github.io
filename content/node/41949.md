body: I am designing a catalog for a company that is touting Disney licensing. Because
  it is Disney, I want to use a slightly more playful font for headers, etc. I was
  using Swiss 721 Rounded, but got some complaints about it being too "bubbly." Any
  other suggestions? Thanks.

  body: I'll third Vista Sans. If you need something more playful, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Grenadine">MVB
    Grenadine</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mvb_fonts/mvb_pedestria/">MVB
    Pedestria</a> are bouncy but not blobby or bubbly.
