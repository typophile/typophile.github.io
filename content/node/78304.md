  been merely a novelty. Now my own children are teenagers and they have begun to
  understand how important their great-great-uncle was. \r\n\r\nJust yesterday we
  found A.A. Milne books designed by him. They were excited! We know a little bit
  of the distant family stuff, but now I want to find more sources about him beyond
  those on the general search.  \r\n\r\nCan any of you help me? Thank you. "

    lot of books &c. which featured Lydian, as, along with Albertus, it owned a certain
    niche/genre of the type spectrum (pardon my mixed metaphor), back in the days
    when there were relatively few typefaces. Here's a nice \"specimen\":\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6a010535d5b9f8970c01156fb6108d970c-800wi_4051.jpg]"

  body: "Lois. I am a fellow \"Richmonder\" as was his cousin Oscar Ogg, another integral
    figure in the design of their time. Much of his work I think is housed at the
    UVA library. I have many of his original books. I will contact one of his later
    collaborators, Rick Cusick (A Proverbial Bestiary) and see what I can find out
    about obtainable material. His study with Rudolf Koch was seminal in his long
    and industrious career, he brought Bauhaus back to the states. Your uncle was
    a true master calligrapher, type designer, book designer and is known by many
    and his work is loved by all. A true giant amongst his peers.\r\n\r\nMichael Clark\r\n\r\n"

  body: I searched A proverbial Bestiary and there are many available. It is a delightful
    little book that your uncle did the illustrations for in 82 and Rick Cusick did
    the lettering. Look for a good copy but do not pay more than 20$ for it. It was
    a small run by TBW which was Rick's printer/publisher in New England. It would
    be wonderful to sit down with the kids with this gem.

  body: "Lois \u2014 Welcome to Typophile! \r\n\r\nYour uncle was indeed an important
    and respected illustrator and book designer.\r\n\r\nI grew up with the Winnie-the-Pooh
    books Chappell designed for E. P. Dutton & Co., and they are still treasured items
    in my collection (if a little worse for wear than most).\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re probably
    already aware of the series of children\u2019s books retelling operatic stories
    that your uncle illustrated (developed with John Updike). These are delightful
    books and nice examples of his illustration style.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being
    a prolific illustrator, he was also an important book designer. Since he did much
    of his work in this area for Alfred A. Knopf, and since Knopf books almost always
    included thorough colophons (statements at the back of the book giving information
    and credits about the type, design, and production), it is fairly easy to identify
    Knopf books that Chappell worked on.\r\n\r\nMany that I\u2019ve come across include
    his personal mark. Here is an example for you:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WarrenChappell-pressmark_4014.jpg]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nI
    don\u2019t know if anyone has ever compiled a complete bibliography of Chappell\u2019s
    works (that would be a nice thesis project for some graduate student to tackle
    some day).\r\n\r\nBut if you go the <a href=\"http://www.abebooks.com/\">ABEBooks</a>
    and do a <a href=\"http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=Chappell%2C+Warren&sts=t&x=68&y=11\">search
    with \u201CChappell, Warren\u201D as author</a>, you\u2019ll discover plenty of
    used and collectible books that he worked on (not just as author). \r\n\r\nThe
    search I just ran returned 1366 results, ranging in price from a few dollars up
    to $2500 (a Knopf first American edition of Sartre signed by the author).\r\n\r\nSomething
    that might be of interest to you in particular is <a href+\"http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=689999827&searchurl=an%3DChappell%252C%2BWarren%26bi%3D0%26bx%3Doff%26ds%3D30%26recentlyadded%3Dall%26sortby%3D1%26x%3D58%26y%3D10\">a
    handmade book</a> that Chappell made and sent as a Christmas greeting in 1935.
    You may not be in a position to acquire it (at $960), but you might contact the
    bookseller and see if he\u2019d be willing to snap a few pictures of it and give
    you more information. Couldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\r\n\r\nIn terms of authorship,
    Chappell\u2019s <cite>A Short History of the Printed Word</cite> is considered
    a classic among overviews of printing history and the history of books.\r\n\r\n\u2014
    Kent."
