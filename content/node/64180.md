  It started with a couple of years of simple studies, random sketches and a lot of
  patience. It is my first attempt to design a display typeface.\r\n\r\nThis Friday
  13th (TOMORROW), I will close the availability to download {kf}\r\n\r\nI really
  need to let the dust settle on this experiment, as I have many more things planned
  in the upcoming months involving type!\r\n\r\nSo on Friday at noon, I will open
  up this site for everyone to comment, love it or hate, I am sticking my neck out
  to hear what you have to say about Karmaform.\r\n\r\nUntil then, feel free to download
  the font if you havent already. Karmaform will only be available for a few more
  days!\r\n\r\nVisit http://karmaform.com to download now!"
