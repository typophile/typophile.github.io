    Tomas Brousil. If I can't be in Brighton at least I can play in the Type ID board
    from here.

  body: "You know what? I'm not even going to tag and credit this one. :^D\r\n\r\nBTW
    Katarine is da bomb. I'm kinda partial to typefaces which have Petite Caps on
    top of Small Caps, because you can do kewl unicase stuff with them. Check it out
    on the Suitcase Type website!"

  body: It actually is really close, because my choice for this typeface was influenced
    by my love for <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=57">license plate
    type</a>. It's got those typical rounded corners and tense curves. ;^)
