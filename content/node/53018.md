  body: Brilliant idea, well-executed. I'd start the 'V' the same way you do the 'W'
    and 'Y'. It feels like it's facing the wrong way.

  body: "I think V is meant to look that way --- like the ryte half of W. Anyway there
    is no ryte way or orientation for elements in this font as it defies the rules
    of perspective and three dimensions.\r\n\r\nRegan&#8212;helo and welcome to Typophile.
    This type design looks to be in the spirit of Roger Penrose's impossible triangle,
    Moebius strips, M.C. Escher et al.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    this with letterforms that feel totally contemporary!'

    like this. So, please finish it ;-) I'd buy it.

  body: "This is cool. That 8 is blowing my mind.\r\n\r\nI'd enlarge the period (and
    dot of exclamation/question marks). \r\n\r\nOf the glyphs that lose the \"dimensionality\"
    on some horizontal parts (ESZ25), I think the 5 crossbar misses it most - but
    shortening it might be all it really needs.\r\n\r\n4's trunk looks too stubby,
    and 2 seems to be falling rightwards."

  body: Looks excellent. I do think the characters that miss some of the dimensionality
    need to have it too (ESZ25). I could try to explain how you could fix them, but
    I'm quite sure you know how to do that yourself. :)

  body: "This is really funky. You could even do a shaded version to overlay? I love
    that K!\r\nIt reminds me of a childhood book, [[http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Impossible-Figures-Bruno-Ernst/dp/0906212545|Adventures
    with Impossible Figures]].\r\nIn a way it is difficult to critique this as it
    plays tricks on my eyes. \r\nSo this is to do with the underlying shapes: I think
    J could be narrower, and the top bowl of B and R smaller. Y should be wider. \r\nAnd
    i think the 3-d needs to be resolved slightly on N, S, and B.\r\nHope that's helpful!
    It's pretty good in every way. Are you going to do lowercase? (Not that it needs
    lowercase)"

    This is great, I love it. It reads so well, but then it has some spunk. I'd buy
    it too, please finish and let us know where to buy it! :)\r\n\r\ncourtney"

    stand to be a touch taller; not sure about the crossbar on the 5; think J is a
    little wide and Y a little narrow.'

    that would go so well with this?
