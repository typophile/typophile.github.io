  I was asked to include the following logo in the title of the site.\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3JcQWpJ.png\">\r\nDo
  you have any suggestions for a type that could accompany this logo? I'm hoping to
  achieve sort of a grungy looking site. \r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n :)"

    combine this with a grungy font? Let the logo stay in focus.\r\nYou could try
    a more clean looking one. Like Proxima Nova or Franklin Gothic could be a very
    cool choice instead. \r\n\r\nDo you have a typekit account?\r\n\r\nIf you really
    want a grungy font, try fontsquirrel, they have lots of those.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/classification/grunge\r\n\r\nCopystrukt
    looks fine.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nFlorian"

    \r\n\r\nI don't have a typekit account. But I'm thinking of getting one.\r\n\r\nThanks
    a lot for your advice, I'll definitely try those fonts. :)"
