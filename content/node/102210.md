body: "I've added cyrillic characters to one of my opentype truetype fonts. This is
  my first time designing anything beyond Latin 1. How do I generate it in fontlab
  so that the cyrillic characters are included? These are the questions that I have:\r\n\r\nin
  Font Info> \r\nEncoding and Unicode> I already have 1252 Latin 1 and Macintosh Character
  Set added here, I'm guessing add 1251 Cyrillic?\r\nWhat about the Microsoft Character
  Set drop down menu? Do I leave that Western (Latin 1)?\r\nWhat about the Mac script
  and FOND ID drop down menu? Do I leave that as Roman?\r\n\r\nin Font Info> \r\nEncoding
  and Unicode> Custom [cmap] encodings> Do I add anything here?\r\n\r\nin Font Info>
  \r\nEncoding and Unicode> Unicode Ranges> I'm guessing I check Basic Latin, Latin-1
  Supplement and then Cyrillic?\r\n\r\nanything else I should change in the Font Info
  box?\r\n\r\nIn Options> Generating OpenType & TrueType> OpenType TT Encoding> Do
  I change anything here before generating the font to support Cyrillic?\r\n\r\nWhat
  about Options> General Options> Unicode and OpenType?\r\nDo I change anything else
  in Options?\r\n\r\nWhen I start to generate the font:\r\n\r\nI go to Codepages mode
  and at the top left hand corner near the Font Info box, in the next box it says
  Unicode (I'm guessing I leave that) and then the next box should say? MacOS Roman
  or  MS Windows 1252 Western or MacOS Cyrillic or MS Windows 1251 Cyrillic? I want
  the font to be Western but support Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nAnything else I should know
  before generating? Does anything change if the font is generated as Opentype Postscript?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help!"

  body: Gabriel, you can simply change your keyboard layout in OS and try to type.
    You can also use a virtual keyboard to test it (native in Windows and available
    as separated app for Mac). It is also possible to create your own keyboard layout
    with the free Microsoft Keyboard Tool (Win) or SIL Ukelele (Mac).
