body: I&#39;ve obtained quite a bit of resources on hinting recently but still don&#39;t
  really understand it. I am having trouble hinting on fontlab because I don&#39;t
  really understand what points I need to choose to &#34;hint&#34; my font, nor do
  I know what parts, besides horizontal and vertical stems need to be hinted. Also,
  what is the difference with link and hint? Links have those arrow paths, is that
  what I need to use? Is there a video tutorial on fontlab lingering around?  <BR>
  <BR>Sorry for the mass questions, I&#39;m really eager to finish my first font.
  <BR> <BR>Thank you.
