body: Specifically, I want to know how to type these Block Element "terminal graphic
  characters" ([[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2580.pdf|PDF]]) as I cannot copy
  them because they appear as question marks.

  body: The easiest way to insert characters is to go to Type>Glyphs in Illustrator
    and InDesign and double click the characters you want. There's a similar function
    in Word.

  body: "That doesn't work everywhere in Windows Si (unless there's some spiffy new
    feature in Vista) only in Word and WordPad.\r\n\r\nAny monospaced fonts that are
    used in terminal emulators are likely to contain these characters. If you are
    getting just question marks, that would indicate that you are entering Unicode
    16bit codes into an 8bit environment. If you are getting question marks inside
    boxes, that probably indicates that you are using a font that does not contain
    glyphs for these characters."
