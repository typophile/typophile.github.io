body: "I was hoping someone could recommend a nice headline font for a trade magazine,
  something with some character and interest (not same-old), but at the same time
  not too over the top. Would prefer something relatively new. Need multiple weights
  -- extra bold, bold and medium -- and would love it if a condensed version was also
  available. Any ideas? I was looking at something called Flama on Village.\r\n\r\nOn
  a different note, what are your thoughts on the following fonts for body copy -\r\nMiller,
  Whitman, Joanna - and Proxima Sans for sidebar boxes?\r\n\r\nAppreciate your help.\r\nSteve"

    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Proxima%20Nova\">Proxima
    Nova</a> (revision of Proxima Sans) is great. Any of the heads I suggested would
    also work well in sidebars."

  body: Thanks Stephen. That is a big help and I will definitely heed your advice.
    The audience is manufacturers and retailers of flooring products, like carpet,
    wood, ceramic tile, etc. It is a B2B magazine, the No. 2 book in the market. But
    we are improving every aspect of the magazine, with the design being the final
    piece. It is of the large 11 x 17 variety, 4-color throughout. There is no designer
    on staff, so I'm relying on recommendations. I'm looking to make a design statement,
    but in a classy, contemporary way. Thanks again for your help.
