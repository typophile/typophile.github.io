body: Ok, so this may be a dumb question, but alas, here goes. <BR> <BR>I designing
  a logo type, it utilizes extended characters &#40;ones I am accessing through the
  glyph pallette in Indesign&#41;, I want to tweak and customize the logotype vectors
  &#40;through the use of Illustrator&#41;, but when trying to paste these character
  in Illustrator &#40;version 10&#41; I get the all to lovely &#34;box&#34;. It won&#39;t
  let me paste these characters. How do I get around this? &#40;hopefully this is
  fixed in the new CS version, but I&#39;m not counting on anything.&#41; <BR> <BR>I
  do have access to Freehand, will I experience this here as well? <BR> <BR>How do
  I work around this? Help! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    them into Illustrator. <BR> <BR>You can make a text box and select the box and
    go cmd&#43;shift&#43;O &#40;Mac&#41; ctrl&#43;shift O &#40;o not zero&#41; and
    get the type as outlines. You can select the text within a box and do the same
    command and get the text as outlines with the bounding box intact. <BR> <BR>You
    can do some manipulation in InDesign. If you convert the text to outlines then
    you can use the pen tool and the tools under it just like in Illustrator. <BR>
    <BR>I can&#39;t think of another way to get the letter into Illustrator.  <BR>
    <BR>If you&#39;re on Mac OS X: <BR>You can try doing a copy or drag and drop from
    the Mac OS X character palette &#40;not the Key Caps application&#41;. Open System
    Preferences &#62; International &#62; Input Methods Tab &#62; Check Character
    Palette. Icon will appear in menu bar. <BR> <BR>Extended character support is
    supposed to get better with Illustrator CS and its new Unicode text engine. See

    about half way down the page. <BR> <BR>Hope I haven&#39;t misunderstood and I
    hope this helps. <BR> <BR>Jon'
