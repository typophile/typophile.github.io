  a gritty futuristic game (think Aliens/District 9). My problem with most \"futuristic\"
  fonts is that they are trying way too hard to look futury and end up looking campy
  and actually a bit retro. \r\n\r\nFor the text face I want a sans-serif with just
  a little personality, and I really don't know what I want for the display face as
  long as it looks good with the text and is in some way futuristic looking. \r\n\r\nThanks. "

    Haus Square Pro\u2122]]. Also, have a look at [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Identikal/|Identikal]]
    foundry. How about [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/|Proxima
    Nova]] for text?\r\n\r\nSB"

  body: There is a style I always think of as 'dashboard sans'. Ralf Hoffmeister's
    superficial is of that style. IIRC, it's free for personal use, so you can likely
    try before you buy.

    and I'm really liking Proxima Nova. \r\n\r\nT\xE9, I found Superficial on Hoffmeister's
    site. I'll give it a try.\r\n\r\nThanks, both of you for the suggestions."

    campy): http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-baseline-pro/\r\n\r\nAnother
    text option is Emtype Geogrotesque: http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/geogrotesque/\r\n\r\nK"
