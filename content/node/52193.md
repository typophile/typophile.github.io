  body: "If this is STILL on his grave, that would be a disgrace. This is a temporary
    marker, placed prior to the final marker. And it is done in a generic typeface
    used on (plastic) engraving machines (think pantograph and stencil-like masters).\r\n\r\nA
    modern equivalent would be Interstate by Font Bureau.\r\n\r\n . . .\r\nBert Vanderveen

  body: "@meister: I think some 'fonts' are simply letters cut for certain purposes
    and don't have digital equivalents, in the case of Andy Warhol's grave, that could
    be the case. A gravemaker's machine that sets type on film for sandblasting. But
    i couldn't tell you anything else. I simply don't know.\r\n\r\nThis is a great
    thread, though morbidly interesting."
