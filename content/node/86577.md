  focus is on TELUGU language. Recently we organized International Telugu Internet
  Conference. In that conference, it is resolved to develop new TELUGU fonts (Unicode,
  Open Type). At present there are only two unicode compliant Telugu fonts widely
  avaialble -Potana and Gowtami. We are interested to design and develop more Fonts
  to make it available to the general public to encourage the use of language. \r\n\r\nGiven
  that, we are looking for resources to develop/design Telugu fonts (both script and
  title). \r\n\r\nReally appreciate your help in pointing towards the right resources
  and also giving me an indication on how much we should be paying for each font.\r\n\r\nWe
  could also build a team and get it done. In that case, what would be good software
  that we could use to develop these fonts? We have designers/artists who could give
  us the characters in the design we want. Please help!"
