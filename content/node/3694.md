  body: I&#39;m not sure this is a bitmapped font. It looks like it could just be
    a very small sample of a font similar to <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg2.html"
    target="_blank">Zavtone</a> &#40;left side 2/3 down the page&#41;, or <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg4.html"
    target="_blank">Neon Stream</a> &#40;fifth row down&#41;. <BR> <BR>If one of these
    isn&#39;t close enough, search with Google for Bitmapped fonts. They are everywhere.
