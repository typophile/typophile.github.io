  body: 'It is currently listed as a free for personal use font on Dafont. It also
    carries a copyright by Steve Woolf (2012) and is based on a manuscript of the
    Gettysburg Address. It reminded me of a lot of the Three Island Press handwriting
    scripts. '

  body: I found the A Lincoln Font on dafont and it appears to be slightly different
    from the sample that DPape provided. I then searched for Abe Lincoln and found
    this font called LD Abe Lincoln [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lettering-delights/ld-abe-lincoln/]].
    Thanks to the both of you.
