body: "Hi everyone, I've been lurking around these forums for a few days now (I got
  here looking through links to antique cartographic fonts) and was inspired by your
  typographic passion to try and make my own font and am struggling to this with font
  creator, but I found the bezier tools really clumsy (and was glad to read on another
  thread here that I was not the only one), so I will probably switch to font forge
  (thanks again for the tip on the forums)to complete it.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to reproduce
  a font used in a hand drawn map (circa 1850) which is also hand lettered. The capital
  letters have long serifs which go to the left (example below of a very quickly modified
  Times New Roman 'A' with the extensions). Is there a name for this type of font?
  Trying to find something that looks like it on the myriad font sites is like looking
  for a needle in a haystack.\r\n\r\nI would be very grateful if anyone could help.
  My main interest in fonts is for use in antique /fantasy cartography - I found the
  thread on cartographic fonts very helpful, particularly the princples behind what
  should make a good one. \r\n\r\nAll the best and very nice to be here.\r\n\r\nRavs"
