body: "Good morning,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone knew of a way to get hold of
  (buy, legally) Darka?\r\nhttp://www.kimeratype.com/\r\n\r\n(NB: It's a Flash site,
  so I can't get you any closer than that.)\r\n\r\nI think it's a really lovely typeface
  and might be just the right thing for some work. However, I called FontShop per
  Kimera's instructions and they said they no longer work with Kimera. I sent an email
  to Kimera and no one responded. Kimera appears to have dropped off the face of the
  earth post 2006.\r\n\r\nI am impressed with some of the work I see and I would love
  to buy Darka at the very least! Can anyone help?\r\n\r\nSincere thanks,\r\n\r\nKeith"

  body: There is a phone number for Gabrielle. I would try that. It's a very lovely
    blackletter style and worth the effort. I found pointers to both My Fonts and
    FontShop, but searches on both of those showed nothing.

    \r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/user/7891|Will Powers]], in your neck of the woods
    just over in St Paul, might be able to put you in touch with him directly. I think
    he and Gabriel are still in contact."

  body: "Thank you, Guys!\r\n\r\nI have avoided dialing the number in part because
    of the long distance cost, but perhaps that will be my only option now. (AT&T
    can have some really punitive rates at times.) I confess I am also a bit hesitant
    giving my information over the phone. (And Visa will charge me an additional fee
    for an out-of-country purchase.) Still, I suspect Kimera is most likely a very
    reputable company (if it still exists!).\r\n\r\nIn fact, I've been tempted to
    make a second post on purchases and trust. How does one know the reputable type
    companies. Clearly Adobe, LInotype, and generally I would assume companies recommended
    on this site\u2026.\r\n\r\nkentlew, thank you for Will's name. I sent him an email
    asking if he was still in contact with Gabriel. Fingers crossed!\r\n\r\nI'm certainly
    open to suggestions, because as Stephen notes, this is a really lovely blackletter.
    I love this man's work: it pays honor to the past while brining it into the present.\r\n\r\nKeith\r\nFabricando

    Gabriel usually works every single day, but maybe this weekend is an exception

    me an email: cristobal at estudio-ch.com\r\n\r\n(By the way, it\u2019s a shame
    that some Mexican type designers have not yet automatized this sort of thing:
    if you want to buy it, you should be able to do it even on weekends. Hope it will
    be the norm in the near future.)"
