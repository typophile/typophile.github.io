body: This is my first post. I&#39;m a graphic designer, or at least that&#39;s what
  the guy calls me who gives me money. <BR>Anyway, he&#39;s getting into book publishing
  and I helped him with a name and then it was a matter of designing a logo. <BR>I
  suppose I won&#39;t give any background, as I&#39;m interested in first impressions.
  I think it conveys an idea. Comments and critiques greatly appreciated. <BR><img

  body: I like your mark.. It got a nice, traditional, &#39;vintage&#39; look &#40;
    and feel &#41; to it.. <BR><i>But, maybe you want to leave some more space between
    &#39;SCAPEGOAT&#39;, the horizontal line, and &#39;PUBLISHING&#39;.. Or, try one
    version without the line, at all, maybe.? And, make sure that the fine details
    of the logo wont get lost when printed smaller, or getting faxed..</i>

    &#34;channel&#34; between the hoof.

  body: 'very nice so far. agreeing with David&#39;s comments. <BR> <BR>wondering:
    <BR>Would it work better without the line? <BR>How would Publishing look without
    the letterspacing? <BR>How would it look if the graphical <BR>representation was
    a bit smaller? <BR> <BR>is that a goat hoof print? <BR> <BR>And what typeface
    are we looking at?'

    class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;The typeface is Warnock Pro, the hoof is
    of a goat with an S of my own design sort of cutting through it. <BR>I agree the
    text is too small/image to big in the first version&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: <i>Thanks for posting these, Kevin..</i> <BR>I prefer the first one of the
    new ones, without the line.. <BR><i>I dont think you need the line, at all, and
    it seems &#39;finer&#39; without it, too..</i> <BR>And the &#39;filled in&#39;
    one is a nice alternate too, for smaller usage..
