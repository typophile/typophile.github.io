  body: "This is the umpteenth time this topic has come up. I don't know just how
    to search for all the posts, but it could be worthwhile, as some of those threads
    were quite long & brought up many points worth pondering.\r\n\r\nFor just one
    example: In my line of work, scholarly books, the decision would usually be considered
    \"editorial\" rather than \"design,\" though that can vary from press to press.
    \r\n\r\nNick's suggestion -- rewriting -- would again be an editorial decision.
    In my experience, the editors would not consider it.\r\n\r\nThen you get into
    opinions. For acronyms and abbreviations, I think small caps should be a bit bigger
    than x-height. The goal is to not have them stick out as full caps do, but also
    not to cause confusion. You can have acronyms that are also words; best to subtly
    signal them as acronyms.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I find no need for complete consistency.
    For example, in a subhead where each word begins with a full cap, any acronym
    should be set in full caps. The rhythm of the line is broken up less that way.
    In running text though, use the small cap setting. Others will disagree, and if
    they're editors, they'll win.\r\n\r\nBut extending that thought, setting an acronym
    that begins a sentence -- or as you show, a paragraph -- in full caps might be
    considered preferable. Not to me, but the argument can be made.\r\n\r\nAnother
    point is whats the rest of the text look like? If there are a lot of names with
    initials, the lines are already visually broken: \r\n\r\n<cite>G. E. M. Anscombe
    and W. V. O. Quine are members of (acronym)</cite>\r\n\r\nor, \r\n\r\n<cite>J.
    E. D. Smith, M.D.</cite>\r\n\r\nwhere some would insist \"M.D.\" should be set
    in small caps. I'd say \"why?\"\r\n\r\nEtc."

    and his acolytes are simply wrong, and in any event have never tested their theory

    There are cases in which you can\u2019t clearly determine which option yields
    optimum readability. And using full caps or small caps for acronyms seems to be
    one of those cases. At least I don\u2019t have any clear evidence that speaks
    against either. And I personally find full caps quite jarring for acronyms (and
    slightly downsized full caps even more). Others might feel differently. It seems
    unlikely to me, however, that anyone would like to read a novel typeset in FF
    Pitu."

  body: "<blockquote>There are cases in which you can\u2019t clearly determine which
    option yields optimum readability.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nYou're actually describing
    <em>all</em> cases! We just don't Know. All you can do is think, and make a decision,
    but placing the reader above yourself. My contention being that that's far better
    than blindly following one's own taste or some pedantic formalisms. A designer's
    taste and discretion will still kick in, but without being forced, without being
    the <em>goal</em>.\r\n\r\nFor example, you might personally like how x-height
    smallcaps line up nicely with the x-height, but if you believe (I hope you do)
    that immersive reading isn't about things lining up* then you demote your own
    conscious desire for things to line up.\r\n\r\n* Consider the \"ideal\" binocular
    lc \"g\" for example.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>It seems unlikely to me, however, that
    anyone would like to read a novel typeset in FF Pitu.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nMost
    laymen will love reading it for 10 minutes. And when they stop loving it, few
    of them will realize why - they will blame something they can relate to (as opposed
    to readability).\r\n\r\nWhen I made Maral for AIM Magazine (a hundred years ago)
    everybody loved it! I was so proud. But then the people actually reading every
    article, the minority who knew what reading Armenian is supposed to feel like
    started complaining that the magazine was hard to read. We figured it must be
    the font, and they commissioned me to make an ungainly -but readable- revival
    as a replacement. But it took <em>me</em> about 8 years to come to grips with
    exactly what was going wrong (the x-height was too big).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    however.\r\n\r\nWhat you suggest sounds good, i.&thinsp;e. one should try to take
    decisions that in all likelihood are best or at least not bad for readers (regardless
    of whether or not these readers\u2014is this even a homogeneous group?\u2014would
    have taken the same decisions). But as you said: In many (or even all) cases,
    we don\u2019t know what reads most comfortably and what the impact of deviating
    from ideal conditions is. We start reasoning from general ideas (like \u2018It\u2019s
    not best for immersive reading if everything is lined up and smoothed out\u2019,
    some would disagree) that do not say that much about full caps or small caps for
    acronyms. And even two people who agree on the general idea might differ when
    it comes to practical execution: If you want an acronym to stand out more than
    a regular noun, full caps are probably best; if you want it to blend in like any
    other word, small caps might be the right choice. Or are small caps <cite>too</cite>
    unobtrusive, even in this case? It\u2019s difficult to tell. That does not discharge
    us from trying to serve the reader, but one should not forget that most typographic
    preferences, whatever reasoning they are based on, are not carved in stone."

  body: "Well stated - I essentially agree with all of that.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear
    about my view of ideal cap-string size specifically: when it's too small (x-height,
    or only slightly higher) the letters that are structurally similar across the
    two cases can cause confusion - think of the string \"US\"; when it's too big
    (full caps) then it jumps out at you from previous lines you're reading, destroying
    immersive reading. Avoiding this latter case is parallel to the benefit of making
    the lining numerals \"3/4\" height instead of full cap height (at least for a
    font with a modest x-height). Also, at the beginning of a sentence a diminutive
    smallcap is particularly confusing. At the beginning of a <em>paragraph</em> it
    might seem relatively harmless, but it probably looks Wrong to most readers.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
