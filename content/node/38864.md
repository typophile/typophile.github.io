body: I have tried every Garamond I own, then looked online at those I don't, and
  I still can't get this one. The roundness of the italic "G" disqualifies most, but
  the lower case italic "p" and "v" seems just like Garamond. Anyone recognize this
  one? Help![img:sites/default/files/old-images/int_6388.gif]
