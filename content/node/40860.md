  logos of sports teams?</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Q_1\"><strong>How do I post
  a type identification request?</strong></a>\r\nAt the top of the thread list you'll
  see a link which says <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/add/forum/29\" target=\"new\">Post
  a new topic</a>. Click it.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Q_2\"><strong>What do I enter in the
  \"Title\" line?</strong></a>\r\nTry to define your type ID request as clearly as
  possible. For example <em>\"1960's newspaper headline face\"</em> or <em>\"Lost
  in Translation movie logo\"</em> or <em>\"retro script\"</em> will do nicely. Whereas
  <em>\"Please help me identify this font\"</em> is pretty pointless as that's the
  only thing we do on the Type Identification Board. Compare it to a newspaper where
  every single headline would say <em>\"Stuff happened!\"</em>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Q_4\"><strong>How
  do I create these nifty blue hyperlinks?</strong></a>\r\nIf you type in a regular
  URL like http://typophile.com/forum/29 it will activate the URL automatically, but
  it's tidier to \"cleanlink\" using common HTML formatting. See the \"Formatting
  guidelines:\" below the \"Body:\" box.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Q_5\"><strong>Can I help
  with the identification of my sample?</strong></a>\r\nAs a matter of fact yes. Tell
  us whatever you know about your sample that might be useful. Information such as
  the country and age of the sample, and whether it is from a web site, or from a
  scan of printed material. (For example, if we know something comes from an advertisement
  published in the 50's it rules out a lot of possibilities.)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Q_6\"><strong>Do
  I need to register to post a type ID request?</strong></a>\r\nAlthough this is a
  public posting area, you need to register. But what the heck, it's free!\r\n\r\n<a
  name=\"Q_7\"><strong>Is this a free service?</strong></a>\r\nYep, lucky you. Most
  of the areas on Typophile are free, but if you wish to support Typophile, gain access
  to the members-only areas and receive lots of cool perks, you can <a href=\"http://typophile.com/membership\"
  target=\"new\">become a member</a>.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Q_8\"><strong>I've posted an
  ID request seconds ago and my sample has already been identified. How is that possible?</strong></a>\r\nMost
  of our type IDers are subscribed to the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/rss/typeid\">Type
  ID RSS Feed</a>, which means we are notified almost instantly when a new request
  is posted. As we do this for fun and there's a healthy level of competition of this
  board, we're going to try to ID your sample as fast as possible. Furthermore we
  have IDers all over the world, so there's bound to be at least one of us online
  whenever you might post your request, day or night, even during the weekend.\r\n\r\n<a
  name=\"Q_9\"><strong>I've posted an ID request days ago and still haven't received
  any reply. How is that possible?</strong></a>\r\nThough it's quite rare, that can
  happen too. Rest assured we will have had a look at your sample as the number of
  reads displayed at the bottom of your post will testify. Sometimes we simply don't
  have a clue. The best way to \"revive\" your thread is to post a little reminder
  in your original thread. <em>Please don't create a duplicate thread with the same
  request as this annoys the hell out of me.</em>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Q_10\"><strong>The
  subject line of my thread has been changed.</strong></a>\r\nThere's two possible
  reasons for that.\r\n<strong>One</strong> | The name you gave to your thread was
  very vague so we changed it into something better defined. This makes it easier
  for our type IDers to keep track of the different threads.\r\n<strong>Two</strong>
  | Your sample has been identified. Your thread gets tagged and we include the name
  of the typeface(s) you were looking for and the name(s) of the person(s) who IDed
  it/them for you. That way we don't need to needlessly open threads to check if there's
  still need for our services.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Q_11\"><strong>My sample has been
  identified. How do I change the subject line to indicate that?</strong></a>\r\nThere's
  no need. We'll do it for you.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Q_12\"><strong>Why is there sometimes
  more than one person credited for the identification?</strong></a>\r\nWe call that
  cross-posting: when two or more people identify a sample simultaneously they won't
  know somebody else is posting the solution untill their own message appears in the
  thread. As they clearly didn't know of each other, they both get credited.\r\n\r\n<a
  name=\"Q_13\"><strong>Can I have a go at it myself?</strong></a>\r\nDefinitely:
  the more the merrier! The reason this board works so efficiently is because we have
  gathered a group of people from very different backgrounds with each their area
  of expertise. So join in with the fun: each new type IDer adds his/her little extra
  to the mix.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Q_14\"><strong>Where can I do my own research?</strong></a>\r\nFirst
  of all our very own Search function (momentarily disabled) allows you to search
  through previous threads in order to check if your sample has been IDed before.
  For example if you're looking for the Gucci logo or the typeface used for the Bj\xF6rk
  \"Volumen\" DVD release, do a search by keyword for \"Gucci\" or \"Bjork\", make
  sure you look in text of messages and limit your search to the Type Identification
  Board. <em>(BTW they're both custom drawn so that's tough noogies.)</em>\r\n\r\nThen
  there's <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/index.html\" target=\"new\">Identifont</a>,
  <em>the unique font identifier that enables you to identify a font from a sample
  by answering a series of simple questions. It is ideal if you want to match an existing
  typeface, or identify a typeface you have seen in a publication.\r\nIdentifont includes
  information about fonts from most of the major type libraries, including Adobe,
  Agfa-Monotype, Berthold, Bitstream, Elsner+Flake, Font Bureau, FontFont, ITC, Letraset,
  Linotype, P22, and URW++.</em>\r\n\r\nAnother place to go is MyFonts' <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/\"
  target=\"new\">WhatTheFont?!</a>: upload a scanned image of the font you're looking
  for and the WhatTheFont font recognition system will search their database and show
  you the closest matches.\r\nFurthermore MyFonts' keyword search is very efficient
  if you know how to describe the typeface you're looking for. Is your sample a <a
  hreff=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=decorative\" target=\"new\">decorative</a>
  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=flowy\" target=\"new\">flowy</a>
  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=script\" target=\"new\">script</a>?
  How about <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=decorative+flowy+script\"
  target=\"new\">Candice</a>? Does it look like a typeface straight out of a western?
  Simply type <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=wild-west\"
  target=\"new\">wild-west</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for scripts in particular,
  try Mike Yanega's impressive <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html\"
  target=\"new\">Script Font Identification Guide</a>, with its accompanying <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/ScriptListAB.html\"
  target=\"new\">Script Font Reference List</a>, covering over 3,000 Script and Hand-drawn
  fonts. It's a very valuable visual reference tool, which allows you to find about
  any script known to man in a number of handy categories.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you
  don't have a sample but you know the general anatomical characteristics of the font
  you're seeking, try [[FontShop]]'s <a href=\"http://typenav.fontshop.com\">TypeNavigator</a>.
  You can narrow down FontShop's large collection to the fonts that meet your criteria
  by selecting buttons representing style, weight, width, contrast, contour, and so
  on.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Q_15\"><strong>What about scripts that resemble casual handwriting?</strong></a>\r\nOoh,
  that's a tough one. You see, these are very easy and quite cheap to make, so there
  are a gazillion different handwritten fonts out there. So unless it's one of the
  better known handwritten fonts, the chances that we identify yours are quite slim.
  On the other hand, if you look around you'll most probably find an alternative that
  matches really closely.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Q_16\"><strong>And logos of sports teams?</strong></a>\r\nThere
  you have to keep in mind that sports merchandising -- everything from baseball caps
  to soccer jerseys -- is big business, so the popular sports teams have every reason
  to make their logo as difficult to imitate as possible. Most of them are custom
  designed or use heavily customized existing fonts."
