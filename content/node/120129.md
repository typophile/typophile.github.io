  Windows 10?

    they really should have made us pay for 8.1.\r\n\r\nBefore, there was a rumor
    that the version after 8.1 wouldn't be called \"Windows\". There was a thread
    with people joking about what they could call it instead. I suggested \"Standard\",
    after all, it's what people buy because almost all the third-party software is
    made for it.\r\n\r\nBut even the name \"Akzidenz Grotesk\" is taken. Well, there
    you are. They should include that as a replacement for Arial."

    body: Yes, me too. Trebuchet is a good looking contemporary font. It ressembles
      Bliss. The only downside is that you can't use it for print body text because
      of the uneven spacing. Just like Verdana.

    body: "That brings me to another font: Calibri. According to Lucas de Groot he
      initially proposed a version without rounded corners. MS chose the rounded version
      instead. Why? One of the most given critique of Calibri is that it looks \"childish\"
      because of the rounded edges.\r\n\r\n<blockquote> De Groot redesigned the font,
      taking out the rounded corners. When submitting the proposal to Microsoft, he
      sent along a sample of the original version, adding: \u2018I like the look of
      it, but as you see these rounded tops look real ugly in ClearType; don\u2019t
      choose this.\u2019 De Groot had in fact been critical of the ClearType rasterizer
      when he first saw it demonstrated.\r\nTo his astonishment, Microsoft chose the
      rounded version.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAlso to my astonishment... Anyway, can
      we expect a Calibri without rounded corners? Maybe as an OpenType feature? Lucas
      de Groot already designed the font without rounded corners, so it might cost
      half the effort. Just sharpening the edges would not cause reflow issues. Besides,
      Windows 8.1 also came with another Calibri variant, Calibri Light.\r\n"

          In essence Calibri is a good looking font. Well usable for print. It ressembles
          TheSans also designed by De Groot. TheSans is very popular in The Netherlands.
          If only MS would have chosen the non-rounded version... \r\n\r\n"

  body: Oh, I forgot to mention. Besides, the rounded corners aren't visible when
    printing at size 11. Instead it makes the letters a bit 'runny' or 'fuzzy' if
    you understand what I mean. This isn't a reason to sharpen the edges of Calibri.
    Neither is it a reason not to...

  body: "The sharp Calibri definitely looks better. I'm tired of seeing the rounded
    Calibri in very inappropriate contexts. A sharp Calibri is some progress already.
    At the art academy I'm at you can almost guarantee students will use DIN. If not,
    they usually don't care enough to change the typeface to something original at
    all and they go for the standard Calibri. Last week I saw it in a digital presentation
    where it was practically used as a display typeface. I got really frustrated seeing
    that. Calibri is a nice typeface, but it seems packing it with Windows inevitably
    leads to abuse of the typefaces. I'm actually surprised people at the academy
    aren't typographically versed enough to make an appropriate choice in typeface.
    They never really seem to care. Well, they're starting to discover Gotham now.
    They're late to the game but they will inevitably follow trends while they're
    supposed to think about their type choices.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I see the sharp Calibri
    has bigger counters. That's good. I sometimes use Calibri in Word when I need
    to type out something before putting it into InDesign and I always felt the counters
    are too small. Especially with the rounded edges, the /a in particular looks very
    small."
