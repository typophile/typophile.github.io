    heavier - perhaps custom bold version

  body: The Carolus Roman from Dafont is from a scan (see screen shot below). The
    Image Club version I am sure from what I know would be more professional and cleaned
    up, although it may have been from a scan of calligraphy too. I do not have the
    Image Club version to check but below is the top of the O in the Dafont version[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Carolus_5684.jpg]

    sure if this is the source of theDaFont scan. Carolus by Forsberg is also mentioned
