  body: "I agree with Mark, especially after looking through the Solotype Catalog
    and some of the Photo-Lettering books. The closest font I could suggest would
    be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/koch-antiqua/|Koch Antiqua]], (a.k.a Locarno,
    Eve, Eva SG, Kuenstler 165)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    but the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/diotima_std_roman/?sample_text=The%20End&sample_size=96">'d'</a>
    is almost there.
