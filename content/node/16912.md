  over at my website. http://www.kennmunk.com click \"workshops\" \r\nThe pictures
  aren't that good, sorry about that.\r\nForcing the students to make the Greek alphabet
  was a succes, I think. It's close to the latin one, but still had some surprising
  characters for them to work on. \r\nMy only regret is that I didn't get a Greek
  to show up for evaluation."
