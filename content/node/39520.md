body: "Dear Fellow Typophiles,\r\n\r\nIn the middle of November I was commissioned
  to design and execute\r\na fresh Finnish\u2013Arabic\u2013Finnish Dictionary for
  general readers.\r\nSince my knowledge of non-Latin scripts is restricted to classical
  Greek\r\n\u2013 and some Russian \u2013 there are major difficulties to surmount.\r\n\r\n(1)
  Technical issues\r\nIt is well known that the localized Adobe InDesign ME supports
  right-\r\nto-left scripts, but are there any cunning methods of importing Arabic\r\nto
  the standard version (i.e. Adobe InDesign CS2, English, Mac)?\r\n(2) Aesthetical
  issues\r\nThe choosing of Arabic typeface seems somewhat outrageous. (e.g.\r\nsome
  kufic fonts seem appealing to me, but I doubt whether they\r\nhave any connection
  whatsoever with lexica...)\r\nThe Latin scripts of our book might be set with \u2018Linotype
  Trajanus\u2019 or\r\n\u2018Brioso Pro\u2019, which do possess certain calligraphic
  flavour.\r\n(3) The lack of Arabic skills\r\nIndeed, shall I have the temerity to
  accept this captivating commission?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions or comments will be highly
  appriciated!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nP. L."

    even within that you have varieties. Of course, I would be happy if you decide
    to choose my Arabetics Mehdi font family :)\r\n\r\n>>(3) The lack of Arabic skills
