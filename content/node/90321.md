  a dead person benefits\r\nfrom knowing that the person cannot reply.\r\n\r\nFinding
  out after the fact that the person\r\nyou replied to is dead is disconcerting.\r\n\r\nSo
  I think we need a way of marking usernames\r\nof dead people; and their profile
  should show\r\nthe date of death.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I don\u2019t really like baseball caps ;-), but I think it\u2019s up to the owners
    to decide how they would like to appear to the rest of the community."

    the problem of fitting a head into a square without chopping off the top. However,
    in response to baseball cap antipathy, I\u2019m switching to straw."
