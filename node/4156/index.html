  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Okay, here it is. I've been working on this project since Christmas. Maybe you've seen my string hunting for these letter forms, but i finally found em all and did my best to digitize them. As with most designs that I respect, i've started to work on international characters and a cyrillic set to match, but haven't gotten too far on those yet. I would set some text for you, but i haven't messed with the spacing much yet. I need some help in that regard anyway. if any of you want to point me toward some good sources&hellip; Any comments at all are appreciated, so lemme know what you think of these letter forms. I tried my hand at two � glyphs, but don't know if either work. help please! also how do the thorns look? Anyone who's versed in Cyrillic, i'd love to hear what you have to say on my small assortment of glyphs, especially the m'agk'ii znak. And what do you all think of that Euro symbol? does it work? Anyhow, hope to get something back on this one. Thnx in advance. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->P.S.

		<div class="commentbody">WOW! i got Randy Jones to gimme a crit. I was hopin you'd take a look at this one and give me come feedback. I guess i was too excited to get this up and thus didn't bother with the back history (or even finishing that lc x) But here's <!-- raw HTML omitted --> a little backhistory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I started this project because i wanted to find a digital version and couldn't so i figgered i'd have to make my own. As to rights, i tried to find that info out and all i came up with was <!-- raw HTML omitted --> this<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and i'm not sure if this info applies to this face. If so, this will definately just be a personal project for myself, or maybe i could give it away to interested parties? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I tried to keep as true to the original as possible, (you can check this against scans of the original in the backhistory) but i'm not opposed to making alternate glyphs. In fact i think i need an lc f without the flourish just for example. I'm not particularly fond of the original A or Q either, so i may try to come up with something for those two as well. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This face was first marketed by MacKellar in the 1890s? so I'd guess that Hermann is long departed, or else i would have liked to speak with him about his great display faces! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for the feedback again, Randy. And did any of the scrolls seem square to you? I'm paranoid that i may have not gotten them quite right. (They were a pain in the neck!) Thanks again, and if you could, lemme know what you think after checking out the original.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks for all the comments! it seems like i'll hafta make two versions of this one: one version to stay true to the original face and a second version incorporating some of your suggestions. I've got a wedding to go to this weekend, so this'll probably go on the back burner for a week or so. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Good catch on the dollar sign Hrant, there are also a few scrolls i'm not too proud of as in the Z. I need to go back and scrutinize a little closer. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tiff, I'll try to work on the spacing so i can set something for you. I was hoping Hrant would point me in the right direction for that one. (I re-read the chapter in Letters of Credit last night so maybe i have a bit better grasp on it now) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the meantime, i'm planning on putting up some proofs back over in the typography section, i gotta finish up that announcement today.

Very nice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I haven't posted to this thread because there's nothing I can add to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->critiques already given by folks with WAY more expertise.  I will simply <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mention here two things: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) The Klingspor PDF gives a birth date for Ihlenberg as 1843 and death <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in 1905, with a date for Nymphic of 1899. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) In the case of these really old typefaces, I always strongly favor exact <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reproduction of the original glyphs, ugly or not.

		<div class="commentbody">alright, here's a new sample. In this incarnation: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) the font is morticed (thnx hrant) and instead of bracketing the serifs on the lc, i incised them - i'll make a bracketed version after i figger out where i'm going with this (and have a chance to look at Bodoni <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) i tried fixing the lc color issues by making my bowls a bit trimmer. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) Manufactured a few alternate characters - mostly just fiddling around slapping parts together. The only one I'm really pleased with is the alt X. Goudy helped me think that one up. The alt k is alright, as is the alt U and alt Q, but that alt j is just nasty! i also tried manufacturing a double s (esset?) but i don't know if it's too jarring to the eye. i don't really know how it should look. i'm still trying to come up with a few more alt characters - trying to imagine &quot;a more elegant g&quot; that would fit in this face and how to make the I less nekkid, the R less rigid and the A less garish <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4) I don't know how well i did with spacing. I can't tell if it's too loose or not. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5) I gave you a sample setting - i don't think this face would ever be used for more than a few lines at a time - if that. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6) I added diacritics - i think i did okay positioning all my sputniks, the ring seems too small tho. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7) Still working on the vwxyz, so don't fault me there, i'm not finished with those yet.

		<div class="commentbody">{Typophile really needs to regain its type crit energy. Wake up, guys!} <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first big question I guess is: do you want the swash caps to stand out so much in weight, or do you want them to be equal to the small/normal caps? And if it's the latter, what size relationship do you assume (if the swash is a totally separate font)? What you might do is have a smallcaps font where the &quot;UC&quot; set is the swash and the &quot;lc&quot; set is the normal caps but vertically centered. But then you couldn't mix the actual lc very easily&hellip; In terms of the weight, ideally I guess you should have multiple weights for the swash - but that might be outside your &quot;time budget&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for form, I think most of your swash caps are solid, but some need a lot of help. Especially those long curls you have on some of them are seriously malformed. Like the &quot;N&quot; needs to be totally rethought, I'd say. Some of them are great though, including tough ones like the &quot;G&quot;, &quot;U&quot; and &quot;X&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Many of your &quot;Swash Caps&quot; actually look like Initial caps which might be used by a book designer to start a chapter.  They are bolder than the typical text (perhaps this is what Hrant is getting at). Much of the weight is in the number of line segments, not just the weight.  As Hrant indicated above, this would work better with CAPS and Small Caps. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To me, flourishes are meant to entwine. See pointed-pen italic caligraphy or engravers scripts like Bickham. This of course makes for slower reading but it is not a problem with small amounts of text as in invitations or citations where the reader is at leasure to re-read and enjoy the hopefully well-crafted typography. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I feel your Swash initials could be used nicely as initial drop-caps with a more traditional roman text face.  This treatment might be fun for an older children's adventure series kind of book. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ChrisL</div>

(as evidenced by the interest or lack thereof in this thread) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->okay so to answer a few questions: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->weight difference - from <!-- raw HTML omitted --> the samples i'm working from<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, i think that the swash caps, the caps and the lower case are all set in different sizes. Since this is a display face, hopefully the weight difference won't be too disturbing at display sizes. I'll admit, the difference looks really stark in the digital sample&hellip; i still need to print it out to see if it looks that way on paper. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Right now i have all these in one font with the swash caps available through the OT swash function &amp; the smcp function gives you the swash+normal caps  combo. I think that I will do a couple other versions, balancing the weights better and separating the sets up into different fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So you don't like the N.swsh? is it really malformed? or you just don't like the letterform? as iterated before, i'm trying to stick as close to the original as possible (see link above), but i'm totaly open to doing alternate characters (the cap X in the first line of this first sample is one of my alternates). What other characters need alternates besides the N.swsh? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thnx for your help and comments, guys. I really do appreciate all your feedback. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->p.s. okay i printed it out and that N.swsh IS pretty fugly i'll fix it. But did you mean there should be an alternate character, Hrant? or just that i need to pay better attention? Also, the swash caps ARE a lot heavier, I think i'll lighten em up for any versions that combine all 3 sets or where they're paired with the lc. whaddya think of that?</div>
