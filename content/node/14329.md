body: I've a friend who's first initial is "K." She is disturbed by the dearth of
  attractively formed instances of that poor, put-upon character, the "K." In an effort
  to cheer her I listed several faces I find attractive, from Bembo to Garamond and
  even Caslon. She dismissed each saying, in effect, that the "K" and the "k" were
  ugly, pathetic things. And so, dear friends, I turn to you. Help me find this lady
  the letter of her dreams, an attractive "Kk" in an attractive font.
