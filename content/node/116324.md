  coldwell banker that the owner has asked me to duplicate. I have the other fonts
  nailed except this one!!\r\n\r\nIt sort of resembles a garamond font.\r\n\r\nwhatthefont.com
  says its \r\n\"Marbrook BQ Light\r\nfrom Berthold Marbrook BQ\"\r\n\r\nBut that's
  not a match.... the serifs on the C are way off.\r\n\r\nIdentifont.com says its\r\n\"Ascender
  Serif\"\r\nbut again the serifs are way off...\r\n\r\ni'm lost."
