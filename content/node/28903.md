body: "Hey All... \r\nI have never been disappointed by this forum's brilliance on
  all things typography and page design. Hoping someone has some time and desire to
  help with this toughie. I really don't know a ton about this, and this is quite
  a practical situation... \r\n\r\nThe document (attached) is for my final exam as
  a future minister. I just received word that the document addresses all of the requirements,
  but needs to be only one single page. There seem to be no rules about condensing,
  font size, etc. but it has to be readable (and, I would add, I would like for it
  not to look crazy and overwhelming compared to other candidates more consise statements.)
  \r\n\r\nSo... the issues: \r\n\r\n1. What are the best ways to condense this so
  that it is still readable and doesn't look anxious? (I can play with the space between
  the letters, font size, margins, and all of those other things normal open office/microsoft
  users know how to do... If there's a really spectacular font that will help do the
  trick I would consider buying it and adding to my collection...) \r\n\r\n2. If there's
  no way around cutting some text, how much would you suggest? (Obviously the easiest
  route to go is to cut some text, I really hesitate to do that, however, because
  I know the \"content\" on this document will help me pass the exam (according to
  the person who read it.) \r\n\r\nWhat to do! What to do! Please help!! I'll be more
  than happy to help YOU with something \"ministerish\" in exchange, ha ha :) \r\n\r\nI'm
  attaching it in both .pdf and word. It might look goofy in word on your computer,
  depending on if you own Sabon or not. \r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance! \r\n\r\nTraci
  \"the wordy minister.\" \r\nPS the line numbers on the side have to be included
  so that the questioners can make reference to them. (\"In line X you say...\") \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Traci:\r\n\r\nI'd suggest the following: section headings in small caps of
    the same point size, with the explicatory text immediately following, beginning
    on the same line (this will save 11 lines at least); \r\n\r\nbreak the text up
    into two columns, although due to the numbering this might waste more space than
    it frees up, and if so, nevermind (there are ways around that though; labeling
    columns L and R and having the same column of numbers apply to both, but that
    might get complicated);\r\n\r\nget rid of the extra (double) spaces after periods
    and before the beginning of a new sentence;\r\n\r\nreduce the size of the right
    and top margins, and\r\n\r\nvery slightly narrower type, although this you may
    not need.\r\n\r\nAnd watch your H&Js.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt : http://www.hewnandhammered.com

  body: "I just experimented a bit, and by reducing the size of the text to 10 pt
    and flowing it into 2 columns, nearly all of the text fitted in. And this was
    without touching hyphenation. \r\n\r\nOthers will, no doubt, have better ideas."

  body: "At last, an occasion to de-lurk. I was able to fit your draft into one page
    without major changes to the content or layout.\r\n\r\nRegardless of what you
    end up doing, though, there\u2019s an important point: in Word, the line number
    formatting is based on the Normal style. It looks like you manually applied Sabon
    to each paragraph. Therefore, the line numbers in your draft are in 12 point Times
    New Roman (TNR), while the text is in 12 point Sabon. Whichever font and point
    size you end up using, you should make the appropriate changes to the Normal style
    and then use Normal style for all text except the footnotes, which use the Footnote
    Text style, and the superscript footnote references, which use the Footnote Reference
    style.\r\n\r\nThis is what I did to get to one page:\r\n\r\n-- Set the top and
    bottom margins to 0.5 inches and the sides to 0.7 inches. This leaves you a little
    room to play with; I can make the top margins as small as 0.35 inches on most
    printers. I wouldn\u2019t make the side margins much smaller than 0.7 inches,
    though.\r\n\r\n-- Changed the Normal and Footnote Reference styles to 10.5 point
    TNR and the Footnote Text style to 10 point TNR (see below for other fonts I tried).
    Used single line spacing, and for the Normal style only, used six points spacing
    after.\r\n\r\n-- Set the footnote spacing to zero before and after (set via the
    Footnote Text style).\r\n\r\n-- Deleted the six point spacing after the footnote
    separator (the horizontal line at the bottom of the page; you have to be in Normal
    view instead of Print Layout view to do this).\r\n\r\n-- Reapplied the modified
    styles to the text, footnote references, and footnotes.\r\n\r\n-- Deleted extra
    carriage returns.\r\n\r\n-- Ran the paragraph titles in with the body text and
    used a spaced en dash as a separator; a colon would work, too. Made the paragraph
    titles bold.\r\n\r\n-- Manually changed the spacing after the title (statement
    of faith) to twelve points.\r\n\r\n-- Manually changed the spacing after the last
    paragraph (a concluding prayer) to three points.\r\n\r\n-- Deleted \u201CI believe
    that\u201D from the start of each paragraph and rewrote the subsequent text accordingly.
    I didn\u2019t delete \u201CI believe that\u201D when it occurred someplace other
    than the first sentence of a paragraph. If the opening \"I believe that\" is a
    requirement, you'll have to do more editing on other text. \r\n\r\n-- Made some
    minor edits to paragraphs that ended up having one or two words in the last line.\r\n\r\nAfter
    I got the text to fit on one page using TNR, I tried some other fonts. I\u2019m
    not saying these are good, just that they worked, and will give you starting points
    for using other fonts:\r\n\r\nClassical Garamond (Bitstream clone of Sabon): 10
    point text and footnote references, 9.5 point footnote text, line spacing set
    to exactly 11.8, content editing needed to eliminate some one or two word lines.\r\n\r\nPerpetua:
    12 point text and footnote references, 11.5 point footnote text, line spacing
    set to exactly 11.3, content editing needed to eliminate some one or two word
    lines.\r\n\r\nDante: 11 point text and footnote references, 10.5 point footnote
    text, line spacing set to exactly 11.8, no content editing needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    then list everything as points of your beliefs. This should save some space and
