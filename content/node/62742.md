  up from questions (in bold), followed by the answers (sometimes one word, sometimes
  several paragraphs).When I initially typeset a sample chapter, I used Georgia for
  the chapter titles, and Century Gothic for the body text - but am beginning to worry
  that this may be difficult to read in large chunks (I'm using 8pt text with 12pt
  leading; see sample below). I'm sure some readers are cringing at this choice, but
  many of the sans serif fonts (I've been asked to use sans serif for the body) I
  tried look quite dense on the page (futura, frutiger, helvetica, gill), and I like
  the roundness of Century Gothic with Georgia, but obviously what it looks like doesn't
  matter if nobody can read it! \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SampleText_6435.jpg]"

  body: "I would honestly stick to something a little easier to read for body text.
    One issue I could potentially see using Century Gothic would be the similarity
    between characters like the lowercase \"a\" and \"o\". My one concern with using
    a sans-serif font for body copy in print is readability- its usually easier to
    read serif set copy rather than sans-serif.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, which weight
    of Helvetica did you try? What happens if you play around with a lighter weight
    (45, maybe?) and track it a little loose, just to keep that open, free feel to
    the text?"

  body: "Thanks for your comments.   I had a sneaking suspicion it was too hard to
    read... I only tried regular Helvetica, as this is the only one I have on my laptop,
    but the lighter weights will probably be available on campus, so I'll give it
    a go. I guess I was shying away from Helvetica because it seems to divide so many
    designers - it seems that people love it or hate it. \r\n\r\nI considered tracking
    a more dense font, but wasn't sure whether that was a good solution. Are there
    any pitfalls to watch out for when tracking fonts?"

  body: Yes please try some more weights (lighter) of helvetica, I find the use of
    Century Gothic here a bit upsetting, hard to read and I just wish it were different,
    more welcoming.

  body: Our college used it for their calendars for several years. Horrible stuff
    to read at 9 point. Luckily they recently changed to Optima. Much better.

  body: Hi, thanks for all your comments.   I think you've confirmed what I already
    knew but didn't want to admit!   And thanks for your suggestions, especially the
    example of Museo Sans in the book, I'm heading off to campus to try them out right
    now.

    The theme was Art Deco - I was thinking of the New Deal era. I too wondered if
    a geometric could look right for text, but I thought it harmonized with the display
    fonts well. \r\n\r\nThe front and back pages of the program:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WPC-ab09program-frontback_6036.jpg]\r\n\r\nAuction

    it - Comic Sans. "

    work too.
