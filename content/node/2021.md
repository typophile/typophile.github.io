body: First time on this board, and I must say I&#39;m really impressed by the knowledge
  of people on this board when it comes to type. <BR> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m designing packaging
  label for olive oil bottle and I&#39;m stuck with the vast majority of fonts to
  choose from. <BR> <BR>At first I thought Optima will suit well for the job, but
  now I&#39;m not so sure. <BR>So, basically im open for any suggestions. <BR> <BR>Thx,
  <BR> <BR>PS. sorry for my bad english.

    the olive oil, it may be inappropriate.

    &#39;blindly&#39;.

  body: 'Where is your olive oil being packaged Italy, Spain and what region within
    the country? Also on the marketing side, what is the target group are you selling
    to and what is the price point of the product? Where are you going to sell it,
    Europe, USA elsewhere? Will you have more than one language on the label?  Answering
    these questions could narrow your font search quite a bit. Dan  '

  body: thanks for feedback guys. <BR> <BR>Adriano, sorry i can&#39;t post it yet,
    because it&#39;s still in it&#39;s early stage of development - laying down basic
    elements and some initial ideas. <BR> <BR>Daniel, Oil is produced in Croatia and
    it tailored to that market. As for target group, I&#39;m not quiet sure, but i
    guess since it&#39;s extra virgin oil that price is a bit higher. <BR>Judging
    from the design of the bottle &#40;&#34;fancy&#34; slim design&#41; and the quality
    of oil, I would say it&#39;s for the people who are after great quality product.

  body: 'Daniel&#39;s questions are right on. <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s for the Croatian
    market, I think few of us will be able to provide very fruitful insight. But let
    me ask this question: does the Croatian upper-middle-class value Western ideals,
    or is it nostalgic for the old days, or what? <BR> <BR>BTW, Optima is very unlikely
    to be a good choice. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Now the oil will be labeled a Croatia product but do they actually produce
    to olives there or somewhere else. You could use a term on the bottle like &#34;Only
    the finest quality olives from the &#40;blank&#41; region of &#40;country&#41;
    were used in this first pressed oil.&#34; Do you have the company name yet and
    do they have a logo? A typeface that complimented but was different from the logo
    would be good. Is this a start up product or do they sell other products and this
    will be added to the line? I have so many question and so few answers. I&#39;m
    a marketing based designer. I need alot of info to make smart design decisions. '

  body: 'A few more thoughts &#40;sick of me yet?&#41; Where in the store is your
    product going to be placed? Is it with the other Olive Oils or a speciality section?
    In either case I&#39;d get competitive samples so you can make yours stand out.
    Also consider processes other than printing on a white label. Foil stamp or print
    on foil. Clear label to show the product and of course die cutting. These are
    all ways to make your product unique. You might reference the wine industry who
    does a good job in labeling.  '
