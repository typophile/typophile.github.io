  body: "Agree with Nick Cooke, very close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emily-lime/carolyna/|Carolyna]],
    may be using some stylistic alternates... Do you know the origin of this graphic?
    it could be easier to find what the font it could be.\r\nFor what it's worth,
    remembering 2 previous discussions where I tried to compile some fonts which I
    guess could be considered as in the same vein: [[http://typophile.com/node/93681|Calligraphy
    Handwritten]] and [[http://typophile.com/node/91757|Calligraphy or font?]]"
