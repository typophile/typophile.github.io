  College of Natural Beauty and forwarded on all files they had for marketing collateral.
  Unfortunately there is inconsistent use of typefaces, and font used in the logo
  is always outlined.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please help me identify it? I need to overhaul
  the brand guidelines for the new team.\r\n\r\nLuke"
