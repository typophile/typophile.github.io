  body: Looks like a very weird version of Hermann Zapf's Palatino (lower-case x,
    for instance, is really an oddity).

  body: That's the original, pre-digital, non-wuss Palatino by [[Hermann Zapf]].

  body: "I actually meant \"not-sanitised-for-indifferent-computer-users\". :^P But
    that means almost the same thing.\r\n\r\nSomehow the original design of Palatino
    didn't survive the transition to digital, and lots of people lament that -- including
    me (though I wouldn't use it in a million years as I don't particularly like Zapf
    faces)."
