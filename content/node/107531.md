  body: "I knew this reminded me of something from the dim and distant past. \r\n\r\nAh,
    yes, when I worked on the Masterfoods account doing pet food packaging about 10
    years back, this was the font that we used for the body text on all the Whiskas
    cat food packs. \r\n\r\nSo based on that bit of old nonsense I would be tempted
    to go with Cronos (probably a Semibold but there are many cuts including a Pro
    version) for the main title and author's name. \r\n\r\nAs for the logo - well
    it's very difficult to make out at that size but it puts me in mind of something
    along the lines of Garamond 3 LT Std Italic.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nDoghouse"
