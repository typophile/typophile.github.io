  giving me a big headache :)\r\n\r\nAs you can see on the image in the website the
  font is not working (looks like it is writing over and over again on the same line
  as you see on that image). I am using a mac and, after converting it in .otf it
  works shows up fine in fontbook BUT it works only on mail and not on word, pages
  and others.\r\n\r\nThis is very weird as I never found a font working in some programmes
  and not on others. Is there any way to fix this ?\r\nI am very thankful for your
  kind help\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nDavid"

    may resolve your issue.

  body: "The problem is broken vertical metrics data in the font. Specifically, the
    hhea table has ascender, descender and linegap all set to zero.\r\n\r\nThis is
    easily fixed by opening it in FontLab, then overriding the \"custom metrics\"
    with automatically calculated ones, and regenerating the TTF.\r\n\r\nNow, I would
    not want to bet on the font working in other respects; given it being badly broken
    in this regard, other problems seem likely.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
