  body: Thanks Yves, It is indeed a "Golden" type - I knew it seemed familiar - now
    I just need to figure out how close to William Morris the publisher Frederick
    Warne & Co was or is it an early version by another firm copied from Morris. Comparing
    it to ITC Golden Type is interesting. The letterpress letters do display some
    differences - slant on dots on i and j are one.

  body: if this is letterpress, then it may be <a href="http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/jenson.html">Jenson</a>,
    which was based on Morris' Golden Type.
