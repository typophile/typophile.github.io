    is handdrawn. He was asking for something similar."

    out there just look for tapered Romans... Michaelangelo (maybe too light for you),
    Schneider Antiqua, Weiss, Sabon, Poppl Pontifex &c yes Jan is right Trajan\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Oswald Spengler was a very famous political author in Germany,\r\nborn 1880
    and 1936 he passed the way.\r\n\r\n\"Der Untergang des Abendlandes\" (engish title:
    Decline Of The West)\r\nwas, what you would call, a bestseller. First edition
    1919, last one\r\nanywhere in the 30ies. (And some more after Germanys surrender
    '45).\r\n\r\nI know all his books and hang me, but I am sure:\r\nThis title shown
    in the picture, is a fake.\r\nThe german word \"Untergang\" is written with an
    U at the beginning.\r\nYes, sometimes they tried to give a title a kind of latin
    touch,\r\nbut I do not believe to the V instead of the U in the 1920ies.\r\nAnother
    thing are the different capital R at the end of the lines.\r\nI do not believe
    its a standard lead letter font with three versions\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nI guess its
    changed later electronically.\r\nThe copyright of UDA was (or better: is) at Beck'sche
    Verlagsbuchhaltung, Munich. The shown title does not fit to them.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch

  body: "Since this is hand-drawn, all we can do is look for something similar. My
    suggestion is an old Image Club/VCG font with very small serifs called Basilea.
    The sample is from the Serif Font ID Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/basilea_full-1_6209.gif]"
