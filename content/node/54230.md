body: "Art Nouveau:\r\n\r\nArt Nouveau was a time period in the early to middle nineteenth
  century that was characterized by the absence of straight lines.  The style was
  greatly influenced by nature and was generally organic in form.  It was very decorative
  and ornamental and often resembled leaves, flowers, vines, birds, insects, etc.
  \ \r\n\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/2459129362_1cf9f78fb6_3708.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  thought that this work, \"The Kiss,\" by Peter Behrens, was a perfect example of
  Art Nouveau.  The flowing hair of the women (or woman) is very natural.  The colors
  are also extremely natural, not bright or enhanced.  Although these women are not
  necessarily \"photo-realistic\" and do not look like reality at all, they are still
  obviously an artistic portrayal of two (or one) beautiful women.  I really like
  the thick contour lines combined with the sections of flat color.  I also like the
  symmetric composition.  I just think the entire piece just comes together to create
  something really beautiful. \r\n\r\n\r\nRussian Constructivism:\r\n\r\nRussian Constructivism
  was a movement in both art and architecture in Russia that began around 1913.  This
  style is characterized by complete abstraction and a push towards modernity.  It
  was often extremely experimental and very geometric.  Generally speaking, the movement
  was extremely objective and minimal.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chimage_5874.php.jpeg]\r\n\r\n\"Beat
  the Whites With the Red Wedge\" has always been my favorite Russian Constructivist
  piece.  Not only am I attracted to the balanced yet asymmetrical composition, but
  I also like that there is a message behind it.  It obviously has to do with the
  struggles and disagreements occurring that occurred during the Russian Revolution.
  \ I think that I have a much harder time creating and appreciating a work that doesn't
  have a specific message or purpose behind it.  I like the combination of black,
  white, red and gray as well.  I just think that this is probably one of the most
  successful designs that I have ever seen as far as getting the message to the viewer.
  \r\n\r\nFuturism:\r\n\r\nThough Futurism began in Italy it soon became an international
  art movement. Futurism is inspired by machines and the new industrial age that spread
  throughout Europe in the early 1900s.  There is also a paradox found in the Futurists'
  work that both embraces and denounces the new and exciting world that was evolving
  before their eyes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/473px-Blast2_4573.jpg]\r\n\r\nOut
  of these three movements, I think Futurism is probably my least favorite.  I think
  that I do understand the message behind it, and that does make me a bit happier.
  \ I like the mechanical and kind of robotic look that it entails.  The cover of
  the \"Blast\" by Wyndham Lewis in particular seems like a good composition.  I find
  it very interesting in that the darkness of the work makes it look angry and harsh,
  but then if you look at the work as a whole, it seems more like it is giving a positive
  message about the industrial age.  I also like the different textures that Lewis
  creates different amounts of the same color ink in different areas.  I like how
  the lines on the right resemble a person (or a group of people) and the same type
  of lines on the left are arranged completely differently to look like buildings.
  \ Again, I think this is just a really effective overall composition. \r\n"
