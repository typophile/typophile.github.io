body: This is an intertitle from a 1921 Mirth Comedy silent movie. This looks like
  it is some sort of variant Speedball typeface. What is this?

    will get you several more fanciful options.

  body: "The closest match would be a low contrast, medium width, medium weight, small
    slab serif font that picked up the distinctive letters like _a_, _f_, _s_ and
    _t_, and had a minor amount of variation to suggest hand lettering, but no so
    much as to be the chicken scratching that passes for lettering today.\r\nUnfortunately
    the digitized silent film fonts like Silentina, aka Pastel, and the Good Bad Man
    have significantly different letterforms.\r\nThe closest I have found so far is
    ClasicaSlabMedium:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClasicaSlabMediumLine1_5353.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClasicaSlabMediumLine2_5928.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClasicaSlabMediumLine3_4646.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClasicaSlabMediumLine4_3726.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/clasica/\r\nGives
    a rough approximation out of the box, and if letters like _a_, _f_, _s_ and _t_,
    are edited could be a reasonable approximation, particularly if the width of some
    letters like _d_ was expanded.\r\nI'll look for something closer.\r\nDon"

    contrast, like a toned down French Clarendon. For a closer match Trilby looks
    fairly good out of the box and could be edited by shortening the serifs and revising
    some letters as mentioned above[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TrilbyLine1_5110.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/TrilbyLine2_5086.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/TrilbyLine3_4445.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/TrilbyLine4_5642.gif]

  body: "As an experiment, here is Trilby with reduced serifs and width expanded to
    110%.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TrilbyReducedserifsWidth110Percent_6653.jpg]
    Contrast seems to be a passable match. With the exception of the top stroke of
    _f_ and the bottom stroke of _t_, no letters have been edited for a better match.
    Customize _a_, _e_ and _s_ and the result would be fairly close. \r\nBTW these
    intertitles use initial capitals that are a larger scale than the lower case.
    Can get this effect by changing the font size.\r\nDon"
