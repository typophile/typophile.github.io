body: I was looking to get some opinions on a good understudy for Museo (300). I'm
  embedding it in my website and was thinking about using Corbel and Verdana (giving
  Vista/7 users a better alternative) as fallbacks for those with browsers that do
  not support @font-face, but I'm no typographer. Any suggestions??

  body: "Corbel would appear decidedly smaller, while Verdana would appear darker
    (and a bit bigger too).\r\nStill darker, but more similar in size would be Trebuchet."
