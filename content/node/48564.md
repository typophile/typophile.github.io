  body: "When you say 'something similar',  do you just mean a light condensed sans
    that is somewhat squared, or are there specific characters you want to match?
    Or are we just talking 'cheaper'?\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for commercial alternatives,
    you could try the new beta version of the interactive [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php|Sans
    Serif Font ID Guide]], and select the letterforms you like for the seven key letters
    and see what results look anything like what you have in mind.\r\n\r\nIf you are
    looking for 'freebies', try Dafont.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "\r\nHey Mike\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nIt was the weight and the condensed
    style, the client thought that the characters in Typestar were a little ' TOO
    ' edge for them\r\nand wanted something similar in weight and condenced, with
    only a little 'edgyness' if that makes any sense \r\n\r\nIf you know of anything
    it would be great to hear about it !\r\n\r\nThanks  "

    not quite sure we're understanding your meaning about weight and width. There
    are literally hundreds of sans serif fonts that are that level of condensed and
    light."

  body: "Andrew, \"Edgyness' is a very subjective quality, and very difficult for
    someone else to judge. To me that means something that's not like magazine or
    newspaper text (a.k.a. transparent), but that still leaves a very broad range
    of styles. If Typestar is too edgy, then Stephen's suggestions are good. Have
    you looked at [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Dax+Compact&x=26&y=9|Dax Compact]],
    or [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/garagefonts/metroflex_narrow_family_ot/|Metroflex
    Narrow]]? \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
