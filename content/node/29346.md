body: "Got a question and wondered if someone could clear it up for me.\r\n\r\nAfter
  spacing and kerning a font to something resembling decency, I test it in a number
  of packages. They work fine in word processors (eg Word), fine in vector packages
  (eg Illustrator), and fine in other packages such as Photoshop.\r\n\r\nBUT for some
  reason they dont work fine in Paint Shop Pro. The spacing goes to pot, and the very
  basic kern feature of PSP just makes the problem even worse.\r\n \r\nOne package
  out of ten is not overly worrying, but it is probably the most used package amoung
  those who would buy and use my stuff.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have similar problems,
  and is there something during creation that could alleviate this problem ?\r\n"

  body: "From what I am hearing in last couple of minutes, it could be a problem only
    with specific versions of PSP, mainly version 7. I dont have any versions except
    7, so cant test it on any other versions.\r\n\r\nAgain, this is what the majority
    of average people are using, unfortunately because it was the most and easily
    pirated version. "
