body: The inspiration behind this one is the Volkswagen Radio station. Strictly done
  as an exercise for myself. They had the word radio created and I went from there.
  I like the idea of a single stroke typeface that only changes in weight. The problem
  with this, of course, is that by the time I created my ultra-mega fat &#40;not shown&#41;
  the counters were gone. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/986.gif"

  body: ' Bauhaus meets Trance - very nice. <BR>That &#34;e&#34; is indeed amazing,
    not least because I think it actually works! The &#34;k&#34; is also cool. Some
    other forms need work &#40;like the leftward-leaning &#34;z&#34;, the simply-too-strange
    &#34;r&#34;, the too-narrow &#34;x&#34;&#41;, but I&#39;d love to see some lines
    in this thing. Extra-large, on white bread, please! <BR> <BR>BTW, I prefer the
    second &#34;f&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    <BR>I like the idea on the &#39;w&#39; and &#39;m&#39; but the extra <BR>space

    creativity behind decisions such as the &#34;e&#34; and the first &#34;r&#34;
