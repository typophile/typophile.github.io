body: "I'm trying to learn about mark and mkmk (and am COMPLETELY clueless) and opened
  a newer version of Times New Roman from a new Windows 7 machine that seemed to be
  using it.\r\n\r\nThe mark feature comes in with code that looks like it could be
  correct but all the lines within the lookups are commented.\r\n\r\nThe beginning
  of the feature looks like this:\r\n<code>feature mark { # Mark Positioning\r\n #
  Latin\r\nlookup mark5 {\r\n#    mark hookabovecomb -280 1410;\r\n#    mark tildecomb
  -455 1440;\r\n#    mark gravecomb -280 1460;\r\n#    mark acutecomb -280 1460;\r\n#
  \   mark uni0302 -15 1010;\r\n#    mark uni0304 -15 1180;\r\n#    mark uni0305 -15
  1430;\r\n#    mark uni0306 0 1040;\r\n#    mark uni0307 -15 1080;\r\n#    mark uni0308
  15 1080;\r\n#    mark uni030A 15 1040;\r\n#    mark uni030B -50 1000;\r\n#    mark
  uni030C 0 1010;\r\n#    mark uni030D 0 1050;\r\n#    mark uni030E 0 1050;\r\n#    mark
  uni030F 60 1000;</code>\r\n\r\nIf I un-comment the lines I get a syntax error trying
  to compile at the very first \"mark\" line.\r\n\r\nDoes FontLab even support mark
  and mkmk?\r\n\r\nThanks for the help,\r\nKen"

  body: No, the version of the Adobe FDK code that FontLab uses only supports GPOS
    for the kern feature, not anchor attachment positioning. FontLab will try to interpret
    the compiled GPOS table producing the commented code that you see, but can't do
    anything with it.

  body: "Thanks very much for the info John.\r\n\r\nWe have an existing font we developed
    in FontLab. Is there anyway to add that kind of positioning?\r\n\r\nLast time
    I looked into font development software for Windows FontLab seemed to be the most
    complete package. Any idea if there is anything else that's better suited and
    / or has more extensive support of OTF?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nKen"

  body: "You can use the Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType (<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html\">AFDKO
    2.0</a>). The syntax is basically the same as that used in FontLab, but it can
    compile GPOS mark positioning features. So you can save your OpenType feature
    code from FontLab as a .fea file and then use this as the basis of a larger AFDKO
    feature file including the GPOS.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you want a tool with
    a visual interface, you could rebuild your OTL features in <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/volt.mspx\">VOLT</a>.
    I've documented my <a href=\"http://www.tiro.com/John/FontLab-to-VOLTworkflow.pdf\">FontLab-to-VOLT
    workflow</a>, which might help your decision making."

  body: "Boy, this stuff has me feeling thick once again!\r\n\r\nI'm working with
    an existing font just for learning purposes. When using makeotf from the AFDKO
    I'm getting two errors.\r\n\r\n<code>makeotf [Warning]  Source TTF font contains
    multiple Unicode values ['060C'] for glyph uni060C. Only the first will be used.</code>\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<code>makeotf
    [Error] For TTF fonts, the Glyph Order And AliasDB file must preserve the original
    font glyph order, and use the same names as are derived by the 'tx' tool. GlyphOrderAndAliasDB.</code>\r\n\r\nThe
    first seems to indicate that one can't have glyphs with more than one Unicode
    code point. Which seems odd, though something I know that can be easilly rectified.\r\n\r\nThe
    2nd error is a little more perplexing for me. I've written a Python script in
    FontLab that dumps out all the glyph names in a similar fasion to the example
    GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file that comes with the AFDKO. Does this error mean that
    its in the correct order as compared to the TTF file I generated from FontLab?
    Is there anything that will do this out of fontLab? I didn't see anything in the
    multitude of files that come with the AFDKO that seemed to do so. I'm in the process
    of looking at the tx tool.\r\n\r\nIn regard to VOLT; I exported the vlt file from
    FontLab but is there a way to transfer the OT features I already have in FontLab
    for VOLT so they can be expanded upon?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nKen"

  body: "I'm afraid I can't offer much help on the AFDKO front. I suspect the first
    error message is because Adobe's own practice is to limit encodings to one per
    glyph, and their tool enforces this. As you say, there are easy ways around this,
    such as copying the cmap table from a font that hasn't been through the AFDKO
    tool.\r\n\r\nWith regard to VOLT, it is possible to export VOLT formatted OpenType
    feature data from FontLab, but I don't think it is very reliable. I do all my
    OTL work in VOLT, so have never had occasion to test this very thoroughly."

  body: "Hmm, I'll have to look into the exporting. I used the fly-out menu on the
    OpenType panel and that seemed to export just classes and glyph info. When generating
    the TTF out of FontLab there is an \"Export VOL T data\" button but it doesn't
    create any addtional files, which was what I expected.\r\n\r\nThanks again, John."

  body: Did you try opening the TTF with exported VOLT data in VOLT? I think what
    FontLab might be doing in this case is writing the private VOLT table to the font,
    which is the format in which a VOLT project is saved within a TTF (and stripped
    when you 'ship' the font from VOLT).

  body: You don't need VOLT while working with glyphs. You can use VOLT but it's not
    gonna make the process easier. Just stick with the glyphs app and you would be
    fine with most of the arabic features.
