  body: The "Greater" looks like Trebuchet MS to me, and the second line is close
    to Lucida Sans, except for the "r" at the end. Beyond that, you've got me...

  body: "Thanks man,\r\n\r\nTrebuchet fit nicely but can't seem to get anything to
    work with Vancouver or Zoo. If anyone has any ideas I'd appreciate it very much.
    \r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: Once again you guys have hit it dead on. Some day I'll find a way to thank
    you guys for the help you've given all the times I've needed fonts identified.
    Until then I'll just keep abusing the system.
