body: "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a typeface similar to Neville Brody's 'New
  Deal' which he created for the film <em>Public Enemies</em>. However, to my knowledge
  it was commissioned for the film and isn't available for sale and use elsewhere.
  It does however, have many characteristics that I'm in love with and it is a perfect
  fit for a project I have in the works. Any advice on a similar typeface would be
  much appreciated.\r\n\r\nMore details on the 'New Deal' typeface: http://www.aisleone.net/2009/typography/new-deal-typeface-by-neville-brody/\r\n\r\nCheers
  in advance."

  body: "Hi Stephen,\r\n\r\nThanks for the link, WPA Gothic is quite similar, and
    could possibly do the job well. It definitely nails it on the capital Y.\r\n\r\nAfter
    further examination, it's the capital M in 'New Deal' that really does it for
    me. I've done some more research and found a number of fonts that fit the bill
    to a certain extent, but none of them are able to quite capture the modern industrial
    feel just right:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/2rebels/gagarin_anna/\">Gagarin
    Anna</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.letterbox.net.au/store/order_fonts_berber.php\">Berber</a>\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5123\">Liquorstore</a>\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    I'm best off modifying one of these appropriately? I've thought about contacting
    Chank to create a more appropriate capital M."

    M.

  body: A good idea, though after playing with it a while, I'm concerned I won't be
    able to get the x-height correct without creating a rather wide character for
    the M and subsequently the W. Limitations of Fontstruct unfortunately, but worth
    a try. Thanks James.
