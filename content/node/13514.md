  /img>\r\n\r\nHelvetica is a Grotesque sans serif face, also classified as Lineal
  under the [[Vox-ATypI Classification|Vox-ATypI Classification Of Type]]. The strokes
  in Helvetica are monotone in weight and the overall forms of the typeface itself
  are based on [[Akzidenz-Grotesk]] from Berthold (around 1898). \r\n\r\nIn 1957,
  at the behest of the [[Haas Typefoundry]]'s [[Eduard Hoffmann]], [[Max Miedinger]]
  designed a Grotesque sans serif face, distributed as [[Neue Haas Grotesk]].\r\n\r\nIn
  1960, [[Linotype]] and [[D. Stempel AG]] in Frankfurt decided to take the face over
  and redrew it for the [[Linotype machine]]. (51% of Haas was owned by Stempel, which
  itself was controlled by Linotype since 1941). Haas still produced type for hand
  composition and larger sizes. \r\n\r\nStempel and Linotype were not fond of selling
  a typeface that was named after a \"competing\" company (Haas), so they wanted to
  rename it \"Helvetia,\" the latin name for [[Switzerland]]. [[http://www.jinnlife.com/buy-powerful-android-tablet/|Eduard
  Hoffmann]] disliked the idea to name the typeface after a country and suggested
  \"Helvetica\": latin for \"swiss\". \r\n\r\nThroughout the 60s, 70s, and 80s, more
  weights were added to the ever-increasing family. In 1983, in an attempt to rein
  in the font's expansion, an updated version of Helvetica was designed by Linotype
  called [[Neue Helvetica]] (New Helvetica) that included more weights and styles,
  and overall made the type family more consistant. 2004 saw the release of [[Helvetica
  Linotype]] (renamed [[Helvetica World]] in 2006), a family of four fonts, each of
  which has over 1,500 glyphs\u2014representing Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and
  Arabic. The Cyrillic, Greek, and Hebrew were drawn by [[John Hudson]].\r\n\r\nSimilar
  to Helvetica is [[Arial]]*, originally created by Monotype for IBM. The TrueType
  version of Arial, installed by default on Mac and Windows based personal computers,
  is one of several fonts designed to be metrically compatible with Helvetica (ie.
  has the same character widths). Both Helvetica and Arial are widely specified on
  the web for screen use. \r\n\r\nToday Helvetica is still one of the most widley
  used typefaces of all time; although it is loved by many, it is hated by some. There
  is no shortage of commentary on the typeface, and there have even been two books
  published by <a href=\"http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com\">Lars M\xFCller Publishers</a>
  entitled \"Helvetica: Homage to a Typeface\" and \"Helvetica forever\" dedicated
  to the famous type family.\r\n\r\n*For an article on how to differentiate between
  the two, read <a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/articlesarialsid.html\"><em>How
  to Spot Arial</a></em> by [[Mark Simonson]].\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com\">Linotype's
  website</a> includes an overview of all of the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/526/helvetica-family.html\">Helvetica
  font</a> weights, and all of the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1266/neuehelvetica-family.html\">Neue
  Helvetica font</a> weights as well.\r\n\r\nSee also [[Helvetica Film]].\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
