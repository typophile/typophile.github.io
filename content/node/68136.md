  CMS called \"EL\" or \"el\"\r\nWell, this one should connect the name with resemblance
  of editing content - you know, all the paragraph edit / text edit icons you can
  find in text editors nowadays.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tipophileelcms_5997.png]\r\n\r\n2)
  community of young physicists, chemics and technicians called \"FactInfo\"\r\nThis
  one should look a bit like a blueprint or something and on the other hand, its simply
  F and I (as for FactInfo) put together.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tipophilefactinfo_3855.png]\r\n\r\nSo
  please, let me know what do you think of those."

    one in such manner:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elcms_4038.png]\r\n\r\nwould
    it make a difference? or should i rework it completely?"

  body: "I don't think the first concept works, at least not for me. I don't recognize
    the icon as a paragraph/text edit one. The second version doesn't help either.
    I think the idea might work but the text edit part needs to be much clearer if
    I'm gonna make that connection.\r\n\r\nI like the second work (Factinfo), looks
    very nice. Feels like the top bar of the 'F' could be shorter, this would probably
    mess up the angular triangle though. If you'd like the bluprint feeling to come
    across I think it needs to be thinner, maybe outline the symbol but you don't
    really need that it works as it is. Other then that, very pretty.\r\n"

  body: "Sorry for my previous terseness. The first logo, as noticed by kattttor,
    make difficult to recognise the E as paragraphs. Furthermore, it reads more as
    E/ than EL.\r\nFor the second one, in order to de-emphasise the upper stroke of
    the F, you could try to \"raise\" ever so slightly the i, making it a little bit
    longer and nearer to the F's upper stroke. I also would experiment further with
    the placement, size and typeface of the wordmark. "
