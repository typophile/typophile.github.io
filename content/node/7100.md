body: hmm...I am starting a poster for a theatrical play. The theme is extremely erotic
  and violent &#40;s/m included&#41;. I searched for a proper type to express the
  atmospheare but untill now i didn&#39;t see anything good enough. Any suggestions?
  <BR> <BR>i hope i won&#39;t receive any junk e-mails after my request. <BR> <BR>christos
  <BR> <BR>P.S. the types have to be open-minded to new things, willing to discover
  their sexuality and nicely shaped.

  body: Thank you for the immediate response Hrant, but although your fonts are really
    nice &#40;especially cristaal&#41; they are not what i want. I need something
    more straight and brutal. <BR> <BR>christos

  body: Do you mean brutal like distressed and messy? <BR> <BR>I once used a free
    font called &#39;Rubbermade&#39; &#40;I think&#41;, but I can&#39;t find it now.
    Anyhow, it had a very wet, brutal, messy design. It came in all caps based on
    blocky groteques. If you want I can try to hunt it down further.

    you need. <BR> <BR>What about Emigre&#39;s Priori?

  body: Really nice stuff from everybody. FF Imperial and FF Noni were close but the
    first too Gothic and the second too playfull. For the moment the Blue Island and
    Envision of Margo Chase have the &#34;perversion&#34; i was seeking.  <BR> <BR>Thank
    you all for the help. Now i have enough food for the eye and the brain to sit
    down and make the &#40;greek&#41; letters for the title i need for the play. When
    i will be ready i will post the poster to the &#34;typography/composition&#34;
    forum. <BR> <BR>christos
