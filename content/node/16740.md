  the book is being put out by a Canadian group; NAFTA at work!) I wanted to check
  if there are any differences between peninsular Spanish rules and Mexican (and Latin
  American) rules. \r\n\r\nThese are the rules I have for Spain:\r\n\r\n1) Page ranges
  are supposed to use hyphens instead of en-dashes \r\n2) Points of suspension are
  not spaced out [...] \r\n3) Dashes separating a switch of idea ---like this one
  here--- are set up close to the phrase being delimited\r\n4) There is a space before
  % (what about other punctuation, some of the authors put space before colons [like
  this : ], but some don't)\r\n\r\nWhich of these are hard-and-fast rules, and which
  are tendencies? And an additional question:\r\n\r\n5) What is the generally accepted
  way to write long numerals? 4,300; 4.300; 4300; 4 300?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSteve"

    you would like to buy \"Manual de Dise\xF1o Editorial\" by Jorge de Buen.\r\n\r\n1)
    I'm not sure, but my feeling is that it's right. Altough I find it difficult there
    to be a convention on this, I can recall seeing them that way.\r\n\r\n2) Ellipsis
    are spaced (a normal space) when opening and not spaced when closing. If they
    are used instead a word or as an intermission in a continued prhase they are treated
    like a word: a space before and after. They can be placed before or after the
    closing question or exclamation marks, depending on the sense of the prhase.\r\n\r\n3)Dashes
    are not spaced from the first and the last words of the prhase they contain or
    mark.\r\n\r\n4)Percent is separated from the number with a thin space.\r\n\r\n5)Numerals
    are suposed to be grouped and spaced three by three and a comma is supposed to
    separate whole units from decimals, but most of the people uses commas to separate
    numerals in groups three by trhee and a period to separate whole units from decimals.
    Numbers of four figures are not separated in running text.\r\n\r\nExamples of
    how is it supposed to be done.\r\n\r\n   11 234,5\r\n7 434 542,23\r\n\r\nExamples
    of how is it more frequently done:\r\n\r\n   11,234.5\r\n7,454,542.23\r\n\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: "Thank you very much, H\xE9ctor (especially for the reference to the Manual)!\r\n\r\nFor
    the ellipses, my question is not the space before or after, but rather within.
    Spanish examples I've seen have the periods much closer together than most English
    examples (although there is an argument there)."

  body: "Some other differences I recall, languages and gentiles are not capitalized
    in Spanish (mexicano, franc\xE9s, espa\xF1ol, alem\xE1n) and the months and days
    of the week are neither capitalized at least they are part of a proper name.\r\n\r\nDashes
    are not used as colons.\r\n\r\nHypentation is entirely syllabical, so it's much
    easier than in english.\r\n\r\nThese: \xABquoute\xBB, are the quotation marks
    that are supposed to be used in Spanish but English quotation marks \"quoute\"
    are very used as well. The order of the quoutation marks to enclose a quoute inside
    others is: \xAB \u201C \u2018 \u2019 \u201D \xBB.\r\n\r\nTitles such as those
    of books, tv shows or teather plays are only capitalized in the frist word.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"
