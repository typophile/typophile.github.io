  for my typography class but I've been having trouble looking up information for
  it. I was wondering if any of you could offer me some suggestions as to where should
  I go to find more info on this script.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJimmy"

    assignment?\r\nThe general answer to the general question on \"more info\" is:
    Google is your friend."
