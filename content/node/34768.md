body: Not sure if this should be posted here, but can't find this pattern anywhere.
  The pattern i'm referring to is the pattern behind the title text...the same pattern
  that's on currency.   http://www.photodoctorgraphics.com/photodoctor/uploads/galleries/gallery_80/image_82_main.jpg

    Sites like Veer & Corbis etc?\r\n\r\nThere is also software to help you make your
    own but it is expensive."

    can download a fully functional demo copy of either the current release or a more
    recent beta. The only thing that the demo doesn't let you do is save native Excentro
    data files - however, you can still export .ai format.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.excourse.com/excentro/"

  body: Most of these patterns are custom and adjusted to the application. I used
    to create my own patterns using CoreDRAW. I'm shure the same thing can be done
    in Illustrator with great ease. Some playing within the program and you have it.

  body: "This is a quick attempt to create something very unsophisticated. If I'd
    use some other curve instead of ellipse I'd look much more sophisticated and nice.
    And if I'd combine some other objects, the pattern would be perfect.\r\n\r\nBut
    just to show you what can easily be done in any vector program if you know how
    to do it. I did it in Corel.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gullioche_6487.jpg]"

    did you use a filter to render that effect?

  body: "Actually I've used blending in CorelDRAW:\r\n\r\n1. I've drawn an upright
    ellipse and a 90 degree rotated one that's wider\r\n2. Since I didn't want to
    play too long with blends over paths (that would actually be the best way with
    less work to get a more complex gullioche pattern) I created a curve from top
    to right\r\n3. I used this curve for the margin as it's set on the image\r\n4.
    Did the blending and adjusted number of steps\r\n5. visually adjusted each ellipse's
    size to go to the margin (YOu wouldn't have to do this if using paths)\r\n6. copied
    and mirrored the result\r\n\r\nFor the special effect I also put a gradient in
    the back (blueish colour from centre to the outside)"

    done BTW."

  body: "I don't know Illustrator's tools. CorelDRAW also doesn't give you margins
    (not to my knowledge of V12) but it gives you custom paths and rotations you may
    need to get a proper pattern. I adjusted the sizes myself.\r\n\r\nI guess if you
    need professional result you cannot always rely on tools and their properties
    only. Some work always needs to be done."
