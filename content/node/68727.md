  I tried to find its equivalent. It's a font I have not seen used in Cyrillic outside
  old photos.\r\n\r\nYou can see an example on this photo: http://www.finetuna.com/zdea7v\r\n\r\nNow,
  I am almost sure that whatever they used back then has not survived past the 40s
  (due to change of fashion or/and regime) but this typeface has been popular enough
  before that and I wonder if there is no current digital Latin equivalent? Anyone
  here have an idea?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    a section for that.\r\n\r\nI think I might have used the wrong word. Yes, I was
    wondering if there is typeface like that. I was thinking about Latin because I
    haven't seen anything of the kind in Cyrillic. Which, of course, doesn't mean
    it doesn't exist but I wouldn't expect it."

    looking for a bold (condensed?) grotesque, mostly high-waisted (\u041A, \u0412,
