    via license you might ask if there is something similar that is free. \r\n"

    parody site)\r\n\r\n<cite>According to a survey by the Prince's Trust a third
    of young people are less happy than they were as a child, mainly because they
    are now expected to pay for a lot of their own stuff.\r\nAlmost half said they
    were regularly stressed, usually at the thought of someone asking them to actually
    do something.\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nWhatever....."

    around the net for you and have found a rather similar font, still not free, however
    it is included on most pc's and availabe with ms office - download the trial and
    hey presto! The font is called 'Arial Rounded'. Not too similar, i know. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nostorey"

    yourselves.  oh, but wait, i forgot, you're all so cool\r\nbecause you sit on
    computers all day identifying fonts. nerds\r\nmuch?  and unlike all of you, i
    don't feel the need to give out\r\nmy real information on the internet.  you guys
    are super lame.\r\nwhy don't you get off your computers, grow the fuck up, and
    get\r\na fucking life.  \r\n\r\nthanks, though, to everyone that decided to not
    be an asshole\r\nand helped me with identifying this font.  "

  body: Thing is, you come here asking type designers to assist your stealing, when
    they are the ones who actually make a living of selling fonts. I talked to Nicole
    over at Process Type about this one and told her I regreted being so harsh. Still,
    I'm very much opposed to stealing.

    to be extremely smart, dedicated, and helpful; if this set of values makes you
    uncomfortable, I suggest you go elsewhere for help in the future, resorting to
    the prose in your last post is really very sad and in some sense demotivating
    when it comes to giving out help and advice. \r\n\r\nCM  "
