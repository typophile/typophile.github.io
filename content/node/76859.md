  am looking for a font for a project inspired by the 'Divine Comedy' / Dante's 'Inferno'
  - found this lovely sample from an old edition. Can anyone point me in the direction
  of a font with similarly spiky serifs?\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks in advance for your time
  and assistance!\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt"

    have the same quirks as this sample \u2014 particularly noticeable are the parallel
    angled serifs on the 'T'...\r\n\r\n"
