  on YouTube is legit? Somehow it feels so internet hack job. On the other hand, it
  tells a big kernel of truth about how the media views us ;-)\r\n\r\nI guess I only
  get satire on April 1?\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.veer.com/archives/001315.html"

    is his fake tan, orange skin colour and smarmy image. \r\n\r\nAt least I hope
    it's fake tan. I have nothing against orange people ;)"

  body: "I've wondered the same thing myself. Did they really run it or is it a spoof?\r\n\r\nFake
    tans are hilarious, especially when they get streaky. My sister tried it when
    she was about 16. She had orange streaky legs for a week. I don't think she's
    tried it since."

  body: "John Stosel is and has been a total douchebag ever since he stopped being
    a movie reviewer and started trying to be a \"serious journalist\".\r\nIt is very
    hard to watch this guy, even when the color balance is correct. This smarmy attitude
    is typical of nearly everything I've seen him do for ABC news."

  body: Stossel is apparently pals with Jessica Helfand of Winterhouse. She had him
    produce the spoof for the 2005 AIGA Design Conference. It never aired on TV.

  body: It's a relief to hear this is a spoof, but I still don't like the guy's reporting.

    still make him more believable than a whole swack of other soi-disant \"journalists.\"\r\n\r\nAnd
    where's Gerry Rivers when we need him?  ;-)"

    mean that isn't shot live every ningt?
