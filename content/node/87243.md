    fashion? Fashion for twiggies? For real-life people? For rock-climbers?\r\n\r\nWhy
    not layer weights? Tilt the title? Write it in Morse code on the spine (if it's
    thick enough for one)? Get a lettering artist to put together a heading kit? kami,
    that's gotta be better than an off-the-shelf typeface..."
