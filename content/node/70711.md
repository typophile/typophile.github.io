    and Kerosene]], doesn\u2019t even care to mention that the actual design is someone
    else\u2019s, so I would personally stay away from it and rather pester Paul."

  body: "Graphic designer/type designer [[Paul Barnes]] of [[Commercial Type]] also
    have a revival named, after the original: [[http://moderntypography.com/Typedesign/Classics/CaslonItalian/index.html|Caslon
    Italian]]. It was originally drawn by William Caslon, but didn\u2019t get as much
    attention as his other more famous designs.\r\n\r\n[[http://paulshawletterdesign.blogspot.com/2010/01/caslons-italian-by-james-clough.html|This]]
    blog post by Paul Shaw mentions the two and also a third by [[Justin Howes]] that
    wasn\u2019t released before he passed away. Last time I checked, Caslon Italian,
    wasn\u2019t available commercially so I think your only option is Slab Sheriff.
    The original smokeproofs/punches (I\u2019m not sure what he refers to by <em>smokeproofs</em>)
    are available at the [[http://stbride.org/library|St. Bride Library]] and I believe
    there is some connection to [[http://www.stbridetype.com/|St. Bride Type]] (edit:
    yes, it\u2019s run by Paul Barnes). I\u2019ve also seen some digital samples of
    the original proofs online, but I couldn\u2019t find the link now.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s
    the short blurb Barnes wrote on his website about Caslon Italian:\r\n<em>The Italian
    marks one of the stranger episodes in the typefounders experimentation in the
    early 19th century. Reversing the fatface\u2019s stress, so thins become thicks,
    and thicks become thins, creates a unusual effect. Caslon introduced them in 1821
    and the punches remain in St Bride library. Unlike the other styles, Italian,
    did not attain widescale success, and most foundries did not copy Caslon\u2019s
    lead. </em>\r\n"

  body: "Frode,\r\nmaking smoke proofs is the method of controlling the progress in
    punch cutting. The punch gets blackened with soot, then (by hand) pressed on paper.
    This way, the punchcutter immediately can see and check how the letter would look
    like."
