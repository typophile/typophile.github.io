  the question is if the change is working. Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks.\r\n"

    not to adjust the leading, too.\r\n\r\nChances are that the logo looks awesome
    when it fills your screen, but set as small as it is above (and smaller), legibility
    definitely becomes an issue.\r\n\r\nI know I'm probably preaching to the choir;
    you probably know all that already. I promise I'm not just spewing off standard
    \"rules.\" Sometimes those rules are appropriate, sometimes they exist to throw
    them out the window. This, however, seems to be a case for the former!"

    Strangely enough I am actually happy with tracking, even at this size, it's the
    leading that bothers me. If I purge my mind blank and look at it with fresh eyes,
    the amount of white space above and below the text seems excessive. Especially
    below. But the longer I look the more balanced it becomes."

    and in my opinion, the most fitting.\r\n\r\nFF Utility, Geogrotesque or Klint
    LT Pro would be a nice evolution in style to FF Din...or you could go with slightly
    more 'relaxed' faces like maybe Breuer Text or Dobra.\r\n\r\nBut as far as the
    simplicity and elegance your looking for, I think that Proxima Nova or Alright
    Sans are the most simple and elegant...its that geometric aspect in the design
    along with their humanist qualities...it just looks so good! :)"

    Conqueror Sans looks perhaps a tad light next to the horizontal bars. Like Jon,
    I like Priva a lot; the G adds a nice touch too. I think I'm between that one
    and Proxima Nova, which has a great simple elegance to it. Alright Sans does look
    good as well though.

    I don't particularly like condensed ones either. Included them just to have some
    alternatives on the list. Conqueror is in fact a light weight, the only weight
    available at the moment (<a href=http://twitter.com/FontSquirrel/status/21935229210>link</a>),
    which is a pity. It's a really nice typeface.\r\n\r\nPriva, eh? Hm. If it only
    were a bit wider... but then it wouldn't be Priva, would it? :)"

    for a designer to post 8 or 10 designs and ask for other people to pick which
    one. You have the \"design\" part down... font choice is your [relatively small]
    decision. Posting 8 different choices that are all so similar for us to pick is
    weird. Just my two cents."

    it partly because I am just curious to see what others would've picked, and partly

    just pick type based on everyone else's opinion, you should know why you choose
    what you choose and make educated decisions. And in those rare cases you make
    a decision based on a feeling, that feeling really oughta be your own. Posting
    the question here definitely adds nothing.  \r\n\r\nI know designing for yourself

    evoke as well as the technical and stylistic requirements you might have apart
    from the logo alone. That should narrow down the possibilities.

    look (not too bad for a software company) DIN beats all of your alternatives IMHO.
    Both Helvetica and Trade would be a huge throwback. To me, the geometric ones
    lack impact in times of Gotham\u2019s omnipresence.\r\n\r\nIn case you are looking
    for something closer to DIN, but fresher, more open and a tad more dynamic, I
    can recommend Ole Sch\xE4fer\u2019s Notes, Notes Soft or Notes Style http://www.primetype.com/faces_info.php?fid=19\r\nThere\u2019s
    also a monospaced version available.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is what you\u2019re

  body: "@J\xF6rg - Thank you for the opinion, made me reconsider DIN. The only reason
    I started looking for DIN replacement was that I threw current logo together in
    a matter of 10 minutes, so I always viewed it as something temporary and in need
    of further refinement. Perhaps it needs none.\r\n\r\nAlso I think this comment
    - <em>the geometric ones lack impact in times of Gotham\u2019s omnipresence</em>
    - is spot on. Gotham indeed seems to be heading the way of Copperplate, if not
    Papyrus.\r\n\r\nNotes Soft looks very interesting. I am sitting here and going
    back and forth between it and Geogrotesque, that's in addition to <a href=http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/stainless/cond-bold/>Stainless</a>
    (condensed) and <a href=http://www.klim.co.nz/karbon_samples.php>Karbon</a>."

    A big improvement over the original G from your 4th September post too.

    I will probably drop the enclosure. The idea was to shape the logo into a square,
    which it did, but apparently square-shaped logos are rather inconvenient to work
    with in an online context (read - to design a website around). I like the idea
    of optional omission though, thanks.\r\n\r\nTweaked more letters. Opened up and
    widened Y, dropped A's crossbar, reshaped the bowl of D to match the curves of
    O/G and inflated R's bowl a bit. Here's the summary of changes, original FF Din
    on top:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ytsd-din-rounded-2c-progress-2_6672.png]"

    cut off angle - totally missed that. Though I was thinking changing S's terminals
