body: the anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion, had some very recognizable typography design.  <BR>
  <BR>Can anyone identify the fonts used for the English characters and the Japanese?
  They are probably the same font, which is some kind of &#34;Mincho&#34; &#40;although
  i&#39;m not sure what that means, and it&#39;s close, but not identical to Hiragino
  Mincho Pro included with OSX&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks! there is also a bigger example
