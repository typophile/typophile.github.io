  month-long Type as Object exhibition with a one-day fully-stocked pop-up shop on
  Thursday, November 19, 2009 at New York\u2019s Type Directors Club.\r\n \r\nEarly
  holiday shoppers, House fans and design aficionados will find a fully-stocked shop
  with several new hand-pulled serigraphs, T-shirts and selections from their eclectic
  House Industries objects collection. The shop will be open from 11:30 a.m. to 6:00
  p.m.\r\n \r\nThen House Industries lettering and type guru, Ken Barber, will bring
  all of the alphabetical high concept back to earth with a lecture entitled \u201CLetter
  as Image\u201D from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., rounding out the all-day pop-up shop
  event. To further feed New York\u2019s abecedarian obsessed, Ken will also give
  a full-day workshop (Letter as Image Workshop) at the Type Directors Club on Friday,
  November 20, 2009, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\r\n \r\n\u201CWe\u2019ve spent the
  last 16 years convincing otherwise mundane alphabetical forms that they can be both
  the medium and the message by giving them an illustrative flair,\u201D said Barber.
  \u201CIn my lecture and subsequent workshop, I\u2019ll give attendees a glimpse
  of House\u2019s top-secret letter-making recipes and encourage over-moused hands
  to break out the pencils and pens again.\u201D\r\n \r\nInterested parties should
  contact the Type Directors Club directly at 212-633-8943 or email director@tdc.org
  to register in advance for the lecture and workshop events. Space is limited.\r\n\r\nClosing
  Lecture: November 19, 2009, 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. \u201CLetter as Image\u201D by Ken
  Barber \r\n[[http://tdc.org/tdc/archives/1065]]\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to creating
  conspicious design, the artists at House Industries have consistently shunned humdrum
  typography and unoriginal, overworked font filters in favor of crankin' out good
  ol' hand lettering. Chief letterer and typeface designer, Ken Barber, will offer
  a behind the scenes peak at House's production process while showcasing some of
  the studio's more recent forays into alphabetic ostentatiousness.\r\n"

    a total House groupie so I'd happily post it in the NEWS feed too.
