  to redo one.\r\n\r\nThis is for a production company that makes action b-movies.
  We decided to make it look as serious as possible even thought the movies are made
  for fun.\r\n\r\nI've haven't really found a font that I like yet. So I thought that
  some of you might have some suggestions. The two fonts I've used here are Utopia
  and Sabon.\r\n\r\nUtopia makes it look like a newspaper logo :)"

    I'd stack the image on top of your type. \r\n\r\nHave you tried any versions using
    a sans-serif? The film and explosion seem stiff, could you do a version where
    the film is reacting to the explosion? As if it's ripping from the impact or from
    shock waves? "

  body: I havent tried a sans serif yet. Making the film react on the explosion is
    a good idea, i'm gonna see if I can come up with something that looks good. Had
    the image on top in an earlier version but it didn't seem right. Thanks.

    in and just rotate the area, nearly every image representing film uses two sets
    of sprocket holes and the general public will recognise that best. A photographic

    at the end of the week and look at some manga comics, tried googling it but didn't
    get much.\r\n\r\nThis logo is soon finished, I can't work on it forever. If you
    have any suggestions on a sans serif heavy or extra bold property let me know.
    I also tried Bauhaus but that didn't work, it can't be too special.\r\n\r\nI also
    tried fixing the space between the letters trying to make it nice and even. First
    i had the text centered with the strips borders but it didn't look centered so
    I moved the text to the left so know it's centered to the strips left border and
    the right edge of the explosion.\r\n\r\nThese three versions is a variation in

  body: "Scott, that's kind of what I was thinking, but the curve should be towards
    the inside, next to the explosion... remember it's exploding outward not inward.
    this idea could be indicated in the second frame just slightly, like you did to
    the right side of the film.\r\n\r\n"

    filmstrip? \r\n\r\nPeter - Sorry for playing around with your logo so much. Tell
    me to stop at anytime!\r\n\r\n-Scott[img:sites/default/files/old-images/deadline_v6_5591_5301.5

    to load at work, so I resorted to MS Paint. I don't think I like it extending
    outside of the film...So I take back my post! lol"

  body: "It's allright.\r\n\r\nI've been loking at the left side for a while but haven't
    really done anything about it yet. I think it needs to be fairly solid on the
    left side otherwise I might be too much if it's gonna have heavy melting and distortion
    on both sides. As for the cuts at the top i added then because somehow the clean
    cuts didn't seem right.\r\n\r\nGoing to do some revisions today.\r\n\r\npeter"

  body: "Yes, I agree after my feeble attempt, that the left side should be pretty
    solid. I don't mind the jagged cut at the top of the filmstrip.\r\n\r\n-Scott"

  body: "I think this is going to be the final version. Client is happy and I'm happy.\r\n\r\nWe're
    going to register a domain as well and put up a website, I'll post the link when
    it's up.\r\n\r\nThey're also regestering the name so there might be an addition
    to the logo with a R.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your feedback.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/deadline_v6_4021.7.jpg]"
