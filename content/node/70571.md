  favorite fonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://wtf2.myfonts.com/uploads/images/d6/d61caa8c28a1fa2d38c3a58d3326fbf6.12266.jpeg\r\n\r\nI
  don't know why but the techno, futuristic fonts have always just appealed to me.\r\n\r\nI
  don't know wheather its because I thought the NASA logo was a cool look growing
  up in the 80's, along with the Terminator logo and also seeing a local car company
  using a similar sort of type face as newstrike on their cars as seen here (same
  sort of style was used in the early 90's (Holden) http://www4.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Hamilton+400+V8+Supercars+Practice+ULCxytBOkXol.jpg\r\n\r\nbut
  there is something about these and especially newstrike that has just always appealed
  to me, newstrike sort of reminds me of a futuristic/classiness. Does it for you?
  If so why is this so, what make it feel like that to me?\r\n\r\nAnyone else out
  there know of any other fonts that are related to newstrike or portray a similar
  futuristic/complex/classiness feel?\r\n\r\nAlways interested to learn from those
  in the know, hopefully I might learn a bit also about why my brain is what it is!...\r\n\r\n"

    to other techno style fonts, newstrike the horizontal top and bottom part of the
    letters such as T, C, L, F, S etc are not as thick as the vertical parts of the
    letters, and the Y, W, M these letters are not reflection type letters (not the
    same both sides of the letter) you could call it, I guess what this means is the
    font is not as blocky, or plain, or easy or you call call it dumb even, as other
    techno ones that I see, prehaps that is the recipe that I like??? \r\n\r\n(As
    you can see I am not a type centered person, but are always eager to learn)"
