body: "My question is, when is a font finished? When I'm building the vectors, I put
  together character combinations to see how the forms work together. I nudge a node
  here and there and, it is better. I can always seem to find one more thing to fix
  - one more node to nudge. At the same time, I am missing other fixes that are needed.
  When do you say, that's it, I'm done?\r\n\r\nI use my own fonts on a regular basis,
  after all that is one of the reasons I created them in the first place. From time
  to time, I find letter combinations that I'm not proud of. Most of the time I make
  corrections in the design and move on. Should I correct the font file? Should I
  try to track down every poor soul who got the font?\r\n\r\nIs a font ever truly
  complete?\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any good answers, let me know.\r\n\r\nJames\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Every time I look at one of my fonts, I find something wrong.\r\n\r\nIs it
    because I rushed them? Because I needed to make some money to pay bills and buy
    grog? Is it because I wanted to move onto some new and wonderful project? Or is
    it because I learned something new in the meantime? Yes to all.\r\n\r\nI find
    this aspect of typeface design completely addictive. If you ever look at something
    you\u2019ve done and think \u2018perfection\u2019, have your loved ones call an
    undertaker."

  body: "@ James \u2013 LOL! So THAT'S how it works eh?\r\nDon't typefaces reflect
    the period they were designed in? Not just historically, but as in the designer's
    taste and style at that time? These things change...maybe that's why we keep seeing
    things that we should change?\r\n\r\n"
