  body: "The section on the physiology of reading was nicely done, but largely irrelevant
    to the topic which is not really \"Art and Tradition\", but \"Technology involved
    in making low-resolution screen typesetting aspire to the quality of metal typesetting\".\r\n\r\nIt's
    true that \"typography\" may be used to mean mechanical process, but that can
    be misleading.\r\nEngineers make typesetting equipment. Typographers make typography,
    which is generally understood to be the laying out of type, i.e. designing a document
    by deciding on type style, size, colour, and position.\r\n\r\nTo address the issue
    of art and tradition: there was once an art (in the broad sense) involved in making
    font technology, but the craftsman paradigm ceased with the evolution of the engineer/type
    designer arrangement of responsibilities. \r\n\r\nHowever, I do wonder about the
    extent to which the old type founder's divvied up their tasks. Baskerville, for
    instance, although he had worked as a writing master, used the services of a punch-cutter
    named John Handy to make his fonts. At the least, Handy may be said to have exhibited
    the traditional artistry of the deft craftsman. More recently (1950s), the punchcutter
    August Rosenberger was responsible for finishing Hermann Zapf's Palatino. \r\n\r\nAnd
    today, despite the proliferation of \"one-man\" foundries, there are also a great
    many foundries where making fonts is split up between designers and production
    workers.\r\n\r\nSo would it be true to say that the tradition of type manufacture
    is that some \"designers\" have always \"cut\" their own type, while in other
    instances the task was/is divided?\r\n\r\nEngineers have assumed some of the traditional
    responsibilities of the typographer, by designing automated processes for justification:
    Ottmar Mergenthaler (Linotype) and Tolbert Lanston (Monotype).\r\n\r\nMore recently,
    software for auto-kerning has been implemented in Fontographer, FontLab, InDesign,
    and by iKern.\r\n\r\n"
