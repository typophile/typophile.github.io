  things for automotive stuff from the 1950's and earlier. See my posts in the Font
  ID forum for the latest I'm working on.\r\n\r\nThis type of commercial artwork is
  often bold, uses few colors, but the typefaces used are often maddeningly difficult
  to find anything anywhere near close, unless the designer used one of the most popular/common
  typefaces of the period, which have been computerized over the years since."

  body: "What you're running into is the fact that a large portion of the letter forms
    from the 1950s and earlier (and also up through the 1960s) were not made with
    type. They were drawn by lettering artists, and they rarely copied existing type
    styles. Metal type was extremely limited in size and style compared to what a
    letterer could do. Consider the fact that metal typefaces were available only
    in certain sizes and proportions. If you are trying to fit a word on a label or
    package, this is a serious constraint. It was easier and more practical to hire
    a letterer to design and draw something to fit. It also was easier to mix lettering
    with other artwork and to do color effects. An additional benefit was that the
    finished design was unique, making it easier to trademark.\r\n\r\nSo, the short
    answer is: The reason it's so difficult to find the typefaces they used because
    in most cases they are not typefaces."
