body: I need help.  This logo is for a jewelry company that designs custom b/w photo
  jewelry set in sterling.  It&#39;s very simple, casual and meant to highlight the
  photos. The target market is mainly women with children/grandchildren.  Please tear
  this logo apart.  What would you change?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34432.jpg"

  body: Besides the name? Just kidding. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think the pickel illustration
    is necessary. In fact, since I don&#39;t think there is any relationship between
    pickels, nickels and jewelry I think I would deemphasize the pickel. The name
    is cutesy, so I think I would focus on the type rather than the literal pickel.
    <BR> <BR>Your service description indicates that they are in a specialized/specific
    market &#40;b/w photo jewelry&#41;. Have you thought of any ways to indicate what
    they do or what their product is? <BR> <BR>I will reiterate

  body: Could you explain the origin of the name, or its significance. Nickel is a
    metal or a five cent piece and pickle is a food. Neither word or the image suggests
    jewelry. Good communications is the first problem in design, if the idea is weak
    it will fail no matter how nice it looks

  body: I&#39;ve wondered about the name too.  It was my nickname when I was little,
    but it&#39;s true no one but me and my family will get that connection.  If anyone
    has any ideas that would be great.

    also playing around with the name Snaps.  Any ideas would be great.

  body: 'Nichole: <BR> <BR>I think I know your target, and although I am not crazy
    about the name, I&#39;m not certain that you would be defeated by it either. <BR>
    <BR>There is a successful second hand maternity clothing store near my home called
    Pickles and Ice Cream. That, of course, makes sense relative to the cravings that
    pregnant women are known for. <BR> <BR>If these charms are to be distributed through
    in-home parties, then the title might suffice, but if you&#39;re looking to expand
    into retail or catalog sales, then I think you&#39;ll need to come up with something
    that makes sense to the non-Huntsmans. <BR> <BR>My wife has a friend who sells
    a similar product under the title, Charming Connections. Brainstorm some elements
    &#40;both physical and emotional, literal and implied&#41; that are relevant to
    your product/service, then go from there. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

  body: 'I&#39;m in a particularly non-creative mood at the moment, so I&#39;ll reserve
    suggestions on names until a later time. <BR> <BR>As for the logo: I like the
    concept of colour plates slightly out of registration, but I think you&#39;d want
    to make your intent obvious so clients/observers don&#39;t see a printing error
    rather than a design decision &#40;specifically, the two green wedges beyond the
    borders of the lavender outline&#41;.'

  body: Well, after some thought and asking people who&#39;ve seen my jewelry in person,
    I&#39;m going to stick with my original name.  But, I&#39;m thinking of scraping
    the pickle.  I also found a font I really like, what could I do to spiff up this
    font, or should I just leave it nice and simple? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34584.jpg"

  body: A couple of alternative fonts to play with might be Beanstalk or BellBottom
    &#40;BellBottom works well with the name/letters, but it might not go so well
    with your specific product&#41;; otherwise, the typeface you&#39;ve found could
    probably work well with some Nickel Pickel specific characteristics. I like this
    much better than your original type selection. <BR> <BR>Try stacking and offsetting
    the two words, then balancing the design with some simple related graphic element
    &#40;links, locket, etc

  body: I think the name works because of the metallic reference in there &#40;nickel
    is silver color too&#41; and the rhyme - very feminine. <BR> <BR>But I&#39;m struggling
    to think what font would be good. Maybe something hand-made-looking, but with
    some hint of luxury&#42;. Anyway, not that 70s thing, that&#39;s for sure. <BR>
    <BR>&#42; What about Olduvai? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Scott-I looked up the fonts you suggested, but I think I like the one I&#39;ve
    got the best.  My jewelry is a little expensive and I don&#39;t think those fonts
    will reflect that.  But, I love the idea of incorporating a jewelry element into
    the name. <BR> <BR>Hrant-is Olduvai a font, or a company?   <BR>Thanks, Nichole
