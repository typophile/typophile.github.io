  sure this is a custom logotype, but, I assume it is just a typeface tweaked a bit.\r\nAny
  ideas of what it might've started as?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It seems to be based on Trajan, which is based in the lettering from Trajan's
    Column in Rome. Goudy Forum is also based on this lettering. If you search at
    MyFonts using 'Trajan' as the search term you will see dozens of designs also
    based on this lettering. None that I saw matched this sample exactly, however.\r\n\r\nIt
    is either custom, as you guessed, or a font from a non-commercial source, most
    likely.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
