body: 'There&#39;s plenty of info about kerning in the Fontlab manual, but very little
  about spacing, which is very important to get right before you start kerning. <BR>I&#39;ve
  been messing around with Fontlab for ages trying to figure out how to create the
  equivalent of Fontographer&#39;s equivalence classes. Fontographer had a very simple
  but effective way of  applying the same sidebearing values over a range of characters
  with similar characteristics, ie. take the sidebearing on the left of cap H &#40;the
  base character, just H by the way, and not  _fog0, H&#41; and apply the same value
  to the left of B, D, E, F, I, K, L, M, N etc. You could copy and paste the characters
  from the metrics window into the metrics assistance &#39;apply to these characters&#39;
  line.  <BR>Is there no way to do this in Fontlab? Is typing the characters the only
  way to do this? It can be particularly long-winded if, say, you are doing a Cyrillic
  alphabet and you have to type afii10058 &#40;or whatever&#41; for each character.
  <BR>And another thing: I can&#39;t seem to delete a line once it&#39;s there - no
  delete possible? What happens if I want to get rid of the whole lot and start again/or
  import metrics from another font instead? <BR>Also, when you click on the apply
  and save button the Metrics Assistance window disappears and you have to go and
  open it from the menu again. <BR>It&#39;s all a bit clumsy and non-designer friendly,
  more aimed at programmers I&#39;d say. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d appreciate any help on this
  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance <BR> <BR>Nick Cooke'

  body: 'Thanks for that Nick, but that only works one time. What I am trying to do
    is apply the same sidebearing values to characters with similar characteristics
    based upon the values of one character, so that if the sidebearings change on
    that base character the changes are applied to all the other characters. This
    ensures spacing consistency as you only change the value of the base character.
    <BR>Take the word ILFRACOMBE where I is the base character. If I add more space
    around the I the whole word opens up like so: I L F RACO M B E apart from ACO
    which are not straight sided. <BR>I have sussed put how to do it. It can be done
    in the Metrics Assistance panel under &#39;Tools&#39;, but lines can&#39;t be
    deleted here for some unknown reason. To delete an unwanted line you have open
    to the Collection/Classes panel in the top toolbar, select the line you want to
    delete in the &#39;classes&#39; window and delete it there. It is called kerning
    classes, but is really the metrics class one sets in &#39;Metrics Assistance&#39;.
    The incorrect terminology was confusing me. This info can then be saved as a .flc
    file by clicking the menu icon, which can then be used for other fonts. It&#39;s
    very long-winded initially but can save a lot of time in the long run. <BR> <BR>Phew!
    that&#39;s all for now.'
