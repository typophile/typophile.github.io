  body: 'So what''s your concept? What type are *you* thinking of selecting, and why?
    Do a bit more research, come up with your own ideas and concepts for type choices,
    and then ask us what we think. Right now this is sounding a bit too much like
    "help me do my homework." '

    style but with modern typefaces\r\nso when you see it you can see the Victorian
    style but refresh.\r\nFor the titles I thought a Gothic might work.\r\nand for
    the text I try [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/centaur/|Centaur]]\r\nor some
    venetian would work"

  body: The book was first published in 1897- if you're after a faithful rendition,
    late nineteenth century style, Matthew Carter's Miller would probably be the best
    choice as the main text font. I doubt the digital Centaur will work well, instead
    - apart from the fact that there seems to be little relationship between the Victorian
    age and the Aldine/Venetian typefaces from the Renaissance era. But I guess that
    - apart from historical considerations - the first thing you should consider is
    using a good, legibile typeface for a long text, and many have been produced in
    recent years.
