  better to use in long articles or books, sans-serif or serif ones? Personally I
  see books mainly with serif fonts and magazines in san-serif, but why? \r\n\r\nAre
  serif/sans-serif fonts more \"comfortable\" to read? How they affect reading speed?
  etc.\r\n\r\nSo please, let's discuss. "

  body: This may appear to be a statistically valid survey, but as the original choice
    of sample is somewhat self-selecting ("50 popular websites on which typography
    matters more than usual"), that rather undermines the results...

  body: "I'm <em>not</em> searching for standard variation of serifs and sans-serifs.
    I'm just trying to find best font type (for most users of course) which is best
    for huge articles and books. For example here are some simple questions which
    I'll try to answer myself later (after an experiment), but I'm also interested
    in your opinion, that's why I'm here. To share my experience and listen to yours.
    \r\n\r\nSo the first park of my questions:\r\n1. Which font type reads faster?
    Sans-serif or serif? (I'll read a A4 paper in English in both font types and write
    down time here)\r\n2. Which font type is more comfortable to read? (reading long
    peaces of text without getting tired)\r\n\r\nPlease join me if you are interested.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "I don't think it's a question of personal preference at all but a question
    of inherent legibility. Sans serif is good for short bits--a couple of lines of
    caption material, a few words on signs. It has 3 inherent problems that militate
    against legibility. 1, It has no serifs, therefore nothing to 'sacrifice' against
    the erosive effect of high contrast (as in black type against a white page). Hold
    your index finger up against a strong light source and you will see that the light
    erodes the outline of the finger, 2, Its lines have no 'finish,' no fixed terminal
    point, so that they bleed off into nothingness on the page while serifs provide
    a definite ending to each stroke, so that each letter is 'closed' and self-contained.
    3, There is little or no variation in line weight (thickness), therefore none
    of the 'rhythm' that seems to somehow naturally lead from one letter to the next.
    All of these failings make sans serif less comfortable to read than Roman.\r\n\r\nSan
    serif is frequently found in museum and art-show catalogues, usually set at extremely
    wide meansures and always hard or even exhausting to read.\r\n\r\nI have spent
    40 years in magazine publishing and have found little use for sans serif in body
    type except when the type is very small and the layout cramped. Also, when paper-quality
    is low, like the rubbish we used for the listings of TV Guide magazine when I
    worked there too many years ago (the type was Bell Gothic, developed, I think
    for Bell Tel's phone directories).\r\n\r\nSans serif has been around for a long
    time yet, for long passages, has found few admirers save for art directors. They
    like it because it is relatively unasserttive compared to Roman and therefore
    more easily integrated into the design of the page as a whole.\r\n\r\nIf you are
    setting long stretches of type and want people to read to the end of them, choose
    Roman and don't look back. It will also help to provide compelling prose."

  body: "What I see, Palatine, is Roman used mostly in long stretches of book and
    magazine prose--and sans serif in small sizes on cheap paper (phone books and
    the disposable like).\r\n\r\nBowerbird, it IS easy to prove by measuring reflectance/contrast,
    although that's not very satisfying. Using actual prose pieces would be interesting
    indeed, but prohibitively expensive and complicated, requiring identical texts
    in two settings divided between two pretty large groups of people who read often
    for entertainment and information to read them for say three hours.\r\n\r\nThe
    results are perfectly predictable. The Roman readers will begin by immediately
    congratulating themselves on their good fortune, finish their texts quickly and
    conclude by devoting their remaining time to amicable and rewarding contextual
    discussion. Not so the san serif readers, oh no! They will begin by cursing the
    day they were born. end of Hour One: mass eye-rubbing, painful headaches. Hour
    Two: bitter recriminations lead to mutiny. Hour Three: fisticuffs and hair-tearing
    culminate in hostage-taking incidents. "

    that many experiments have been done.\r\nand their aggregated results are anything
    but clear...\r\n\r\nbut if you want to do your own iteration, i'd suggest\r\nthat
    -- in addition to randomly assigning the subjects\r\nto a serif/sans groups --
    you also should assign them\r\n(randomly, of course) to a \"choice versus no-choice\"\r\nvariable,

    how i have cleverly dodged the thorny question\r\nabout how you would define your
