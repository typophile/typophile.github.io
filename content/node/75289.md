body: "Good evening!\r\nI am pleased to announce my new font, called Ataxia. I would
  like to hear opinions about the project! \r\n\r\nAtaxia was designed to be used
  in long texts such as books and magazines. \r\nThe font has the weights regular,
  bold, italic and bold italic as well as ligatures, small caps, oldstyle numbers
  and support for many languages, with more than 500 glyphs.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/danieljusti/ataxia/\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_4658.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/02_4602.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/03_4012.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/04_5803.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/05_3567.png]"

  body: "This face is fucking great. :)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to see it expanded
    into more weights and get some discretionary ligatures in there.\r\n\r\nI love
    the italics, too. Very quirky, but fit well with the overall aesthetic. Great
    work."

  body: Daniel, as I already said in Critique section, Ataxia is a beautiful and very
    clear font. I like it and think you will have a great product after these corrections.
    I also loved you rainy photos (taken in Sampa, I suppose).
