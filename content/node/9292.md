  like for school &#40;University of Wisconsin-Stout&#41; and was wondering if anyone
  would be able to give me a lead to individuals &amp;/or firms who focus on such
  things. Thanks! '

    and you can also check out the site of <a href="http://www.gigart.com">someone
    I know</a> who does a lot of posters locally &#40;San Francisco area&#41;.

    target="_blank">Asterik</a>. <BR> <BR>The second studio is very talented, but
    I wonder if they <BR>meant to call themselves &#34;Asterisk&#34;. Oops.

  body: That Aesthetic Apparatus site rocks. As someone who just wasted $80 hoping
    to be inspired by what turned out to be horrrrrendously overrated, overpriced
    Graphis books &#40;I got them at a deep discount, and they weren&#39;t even worth
    that&#41;, that AA stuff gives me reason to hope that good poster design still
    lives and thrives. <BR> <BR>Thanks to Jessica for starting a great thread.

    became &#34;Aster Rick,&#34; which became &#34;Star Rick,&#34; which became &#34;<a

    Starr</a>,&#34; which probably means nothing to most of you, but if you&#39;ve
    spent any time on the University of California, Berkeley campus in the past 15
    years or so, it will mean something. Exactly what, I don&#39;t know, but something.'

  body: Recently Jonathan Barnbrook designed the cover of the last David Bowie Album,
    Heaten, using two custom typefaces of his own creation. One of them, Priori, is
    to be released soon by Emigre. <BR>The use of photography is fantastic, also,
    and everything is so beautifully tied with the album themes. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    the biggest examples are Vaughan Oliver and V23 as mentioned &#40;see examples
    in Typography Now also, and don&#39;t forget The Pixies&#39; covers&#41;, Neville
    Brody &#40;for Cabaret Voltaire and many others; samples on the Graphic Language
    of Neville Brody book by Jon Wozencroft&#41;, Gareth Hague and David James &#40;even
    the Alias typeface Metsys is loosely based on the System 7 band logo&#41;, Me
    Company and the Designers Republic &#40;fantastic covers for The Orb, and above
    all The Shamen; Matt Perkins even did a typographical remix of The Shamen&#39;s
    original logo, in the form of  a mind-numbing typeface which you can download
    at the Typography in Decay webpage&#41;. <BR>I&#39;m sure I forgot a lot of others.
