body: What is a good serif font to pair with Futura? I'm using Futura Std Heavy/Bold
  to be more specific. I've been on the website typeconnection.com and it says that
  ITC Century is a good one but I'm not sure yet if that's the best right now. Does
  anyone have any suggestions? Preferably fonts that could be found on the Adobe Font
  Folio Package because that's what I have access to.
