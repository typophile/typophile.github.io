  | Myfonts.com]].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVectis, named in honor of the Roman settlement of
  Britain\u2019s south coast on the Isle of Wight, brings a fresh approach to the
  classic simple elegance of ancient Roman faces.\r\n\r\nVectis is offered as a small
  caps face designed to add a fresh hint of character to this style of classical design.\r\n\r\nVectis
  can lend a note of formal dignity to any design project or poster and is ideal for
  clear headings and titles with a traditional feel. Two weights are offered, regular
  and bold, as well as a range of alternate letterforms and ligatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Vectis_Gallery1

  body: "Handsome font, Paul!\r\n\r\nPlease help me be clear on your EULA:\r\n\r\n<strong>You
    may use the licensed fonts to create EPS files or other scalable drawings provided
    that such files are only used by the household or company licensing the font.</strong>\r\n\r\nDoes
    this prevent me from creating logos or other materials for my design clients?
    The phrase \"provided that such files are only used by the ... company licensing
    the font\" has me stuck, since my client's would be the ones using the final vector
    logo, not me.\r\n\r\n<strong>You may provide the font to a graphic designer, printer
    or other service bureau that is working on your behalf only if they agree to use
    the font exclusively for your work, agree to the terms of this license, and retain
    no copies of the font on completion of the work. </strong>\r\n\r\nAs with above,
    since I am the graphic designer do I license the font or do I point a client at
    the font, have them license it and give it to me to work on their project only.
    That seems to be compliant, but does not allow me to keep the font to show to
    future clients.\r\n\r\n<strong>You may import characters from the font as graphical
    objects into a drawing program and modify such graphical objects. </strong>\r\n\r\nPlease
    see <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/64265\">this post</a> and let me know
    if the examples there would generally be allowed under your EULA.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your consideration!\r\nRobert"

  body: "Robert,  Ive read both your posts, and speaking purely for myself and Greater
    Albion I'd respond as follows.   Please bear that in mind as the text of the EULA
    you quote is actually Myfonts standard one, and other foundries may use the same
    text but interpret it differently to the comments that follow.\r\n\r\nFirstly,
    \ I'm more than happy with your approach of never passing the font file to the
    client, and encouraging them to purchase it if they wish to make more use of the
    typeface.  In that context I (and Greater Albion) interpret \"You may use the
    licensed fonts to create EPS files or other scalable drawings provided that such
    files are only used by the household or company licensing the font\" as refering
    to your use of the .eps you create by selling it.  Of course, it is then reasonable
    to assume that those who purchase the .eps will make further use of it and I/we
    have no problem with that whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMy view on the above would not vary
    whether you have modified the letterforms or not.  In short, Greater Albion is
    fine with your present operating procedure of licensing the fonts for your design
    house, and selling your creative efforts, which may happen to have employed our
    fonts, to your clients for use under terms set by you.  We're also more than thankful
    for any referals you pass on to your clients interested in using our fonts directly.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    have failed to address the direct question...yet.\r\n\r\nI have just purchased
