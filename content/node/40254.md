body: "I'm designing a book about the people and places of the west coast of Vancouver
  Island around the late 1800s to early 1900s and I'm looking for text font ideas.
  \r\n\r\nThe book will likely be over 300 pages in length and will feature a lot
  of old images from the period sprinkled throughout the text. The book will likely
  be printed two colour to gain the sepia look for the photos and will be printed
  on coated stock. The text itself is more reader friendly than a normal scholarly
  book and it's intention is to bring the people to life rather than just relate names
  and dates. So I'm looking for a type face that is going to be easy to read over
  the length of the book and has all the necessary parts (italics, SC, old style fig,
  etc).\r\n\r\nThe book will have chapter openers that will be set up as a special
  spread but other than that it has no subheads in the text although it does have
  excerpts (which I'll likely just handle by indenting) and some captions (likely
  just italic).\r\n\r\nIn preparing a first sample I used Caslon since it was in use
  during the period. My thinking was that I wanted a \"heavier\" face as opposed to
  a \"prettier\" face given the people and places portrayed in the book. The author
  was not that keen on the type and preferred a sample prepared by a non-designer
  friend who had used FF Humanist as a text face (which is not really an option IMHO).\r\n\r\nOther
  options I'd thought of were Baskerville and Walbaum. I suppose another natural might
  be Cartier Book although I've never used it. But I'm also open to something new
  and elegant to satisfy the author's request for a \"classy\" look.\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n"

    to go with less contrasty, somewhat more idiosyncratic type, which I wouldn't
    call Caslon, Baskerville, or Walbaum. You may like <a href=http://www.stormtype.com/>StormType's</a>
    John Baskerville or Walbaum Text, as they're a bit more interesting than typical
    interpretations of the sources. Storm's Jannon and Regent could be other options,
    but I think you may be best off with type with less of an historical model. <a
    href=http://vllg.com/KLIM/Feijoa/mudTyper+Weights/>Feijoa</a> came to mind, as
    did <a href=www.ourtype.be>Amalia and Fresco</a> from OurType.\r\n\r\nEDIT: And
    how could I forget the <a href=http://joshuadarden.com/shop/>Freight</a> series?"

  body: "Cartier Book, while undoubtedly Canadian, doesn't sound resonant with the
    period. A nice dark transitional face is [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=clifford&x=0&y=0|Clifford,]]
    and if you use all 3 size variants you would get more design mileage. Clifford
    offers comfort, strength, warmth and that ineffable 19th-century feel, without
    being dry.\r\n\r\nFor another face by Rod McDonald, and also fitting in its economy,
    warmth and color is [[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=414154&grab_id=0&page_id=37426&query=laurentian&SCOPE=Fonts|Laurentian,]]\r\nwhich
    is narrower, higher contrast, and more oldstyle, but still a comfortable reading
    type. Clifford has no bold, Laurentian has three weights. "

    think I'd back out of the project.\r\n\r\nIgnoring the author for a bit: Everybody
    has their own favorite fonts to fall back on; in this case, mine would probably
    be a Janson that I've worked over considerably. Less to do with the particulars
    of printing in the period, more to do with a general feeling; it is a rugged font,
    and not out of place in terns of the timeframe.\r\n\r\nMy problem with Janson
    is always \"What to use for display?\" Something like the Champions, screened
    in the heavier sizes seems to work passably.\r\n\r\nIf the author likes the fruity
    stuff, it doesn't sound like you're going to be happy, with good reason.\r\n\r\nThough,
    just maybe he'd like Trinite & would spring the 1,000 euros for the cost? At least
    you'd get Trinite out of it.\r\n\r\nGood luck"

  body: "If I were given a project like this one, I'd be looking for a typeface with
    oldstyle roots, not too fancy, and with reasonably good weight to handle the coated
    stock, such as MVB Verdigris, or if you want a Canadian-designed font, then Laurentian
    as suggested above would be worth trying. Cartier is a beautiful typeface but
    not right for this.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/verdigris/pk_verdigris.htm\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Just taking a look at FF Clifford--yes, that would be a good choice too. It has
    three optical sizes. Lack of a bold shouldn't be drawback: for book work, the
    roman, italic and small caps are all you need."

  body: As I have mentioned on other threads, the best way to call up this period
    is with ITC Bodoni Twelve, from ITC, loaded with oldstyle figures and all the
    extra weights and glyphs you'll need. Storm's Walbaum is perfect for earlier 19th
    century, esp German romantic in theme. Storm's Regent II is excellent for this
    also, but a tad dark and heavy, though the italic is fabulous, esp for display.
    Janson with oldstyle figures is always great for books, regardless of subject.
    I love FF Clifford, but releasing such a useful family without bold and bold italic
    is just moronic, so I have scorned getting it. Ditto Requiem.

  body: You totally have to look up [[Jim Rimmer]] in Vancouver, BC. His Albertan
    or Amethyst might be perfect for the project since they <em>exude</em> Pacific
    NW AND fit the heavy vs. pretty argument.

  body: "I was going to use Amethyst for a project a year or so ago but found some
    kerning problems I considered unacceptable. You'd want to check to see if the
    foundry has addressed these. Jim Rimmer's fonts are available from P22.\r\n\r\nDon't
    worry about bold. If you're typesetting a book and think you need bold, go out
    for a walk, breath some fresh air, then come back and tackle the problem again.
    Ninety-nine time out of a hundred there's a better typographic solution."

  body: 'Gary, use of bold in book design is a real problem. Especially in academic
    non-fiction, if the author wants bold, he may well be entitled to it, whatever
    the book designer thinks, and the publisher does not want to be told the chosen
    typeface does not offer bold or bold italic. I''ve never understood issuing type
    families with only one weight: Clifford would be selling much more today if it
    were complete, same with Requiem. The foundry is just being short-sighted.'
