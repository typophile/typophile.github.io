<p>There is long debate over just what to call these critters. &ldquo;Case fractions&rdquo; or &ldquo;piece fractions&rdquo; are two of the most common terms. To me, &ldquo;arbitrary fractions&rdquo; most closely resembles the historical &ldquo;piece fraction,&rdquo; but you could argue that, too.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite> &gt; The brilliant “space to space.thin” idea is taken from Tal </cite></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take some credit for that. I went to Tal with that issue, because of my work with cookbooks and building books. The promise of OpenType and Unicode was that the underlying semantic information would be retained when crossing presentational thresholds, and yet integer-fraction combinations would break down moving from Editorial (where there was a space to distinguish 1 1/2 from 11/2) to Design where space between integer and proper stacked fractions is routinely removed. Backing text out of Design files for other editions or re-purposing would require careful proofing to find these integer-fraction cases.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that Karsten had come up with an algorithm to remove dates from being caught up by the substitution. That was one of the only situations where I foresaw a breakdown in this global approach. (That and specialized conventions like roof pitches, where 9/12 is not a fraction.) But Tal and I figured that manually unstyling a date exception would be less onerous than all the fraction styling in many situations.</p>
<p>I remember some threads about fraction codes, but I don&rsquo;t often keep tabs on the Build forum, so I must have missed some.</p>
<p>Glad to see you&rsquo;re implementing this approach. I&rsquo;ve convinced FB to put it into Whitman OT (when we get around to building that out), and I think they&rsquo;re going to adopt it as a standard implementation.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Kent, It looks OK except for those of us who have a history of doing fractions a certain way. For example, we &ldquo;preprocess,&rdquo; or &ldquo;precode&rdquo; text files, changing them to &ldquo;InDesign Tagged Text&rdquo; files before bringing them into InDesign. The instruction to use the fraction &ldquo;feature&rdquo; is coded there. And any space following the full numeral removed; there is a class kern between any number and any numerator.</p>
<p>Not saying this is better, since most people don&rsquo;t preprocess their text files (but thereby lose a lot of possibilities).</p>
<p>BTW, we use to have a lot of such features with the old PostScript fonts, using TeX &amp; macros. We always made up a &ldquo;superiors&rdquo; font, alpha/numerics, with everything on the baseline. We wrote a &ldquo;nut fraction&rdquo; macro; as you can imagine, we had, essentially, &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; nut fractions. A slight modification gave us musical time (stacked numbers w/o the bar). Arbitrary slashed fractions were a piece of cake.</p>
<p>I suppose most of this could be implemented in OpenType, except how to draw the variable length bar with arbitrary nut fractions?</p>
<p>BTW2, Matthew Carter frequently has nut fractions available for his fonts, but sometimes you have to get up with Cherie Cone &amp; buy them. Always Type 1, to date. I believe I have them for Miller, and as mentioned above, Monticello.</p>

<p>I believe the best way, in OpenType, would be to include it with the numerator.
So the numerator is always centred over the bar without getting into zero widths and overlapping negative kerns, which I found to be not consistently interpreted in Adobe apps.
But it would entail a lot of glyphs and coding, so I haven&rsquo;t done it yet.</p>
<p>But really, why bother, unless doing a math font, which is something else again.</p>

We all learn fractions in math at school and render them in &ldquo;nut&rdquo; format with a horizontal bar, yet in recent years expediency (sloppiness under the guise of legibility) has obselesced presenting them that way in type.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Charles, if I understand your preprocessing correctly, that&rsquo;s not going to create a problem with the fraction approach that Tal, Nick, and I am advocating. The thing about this approach is that it still performs as expected in a workflow that is accommodated to an Adobe-style arbitrary fraction feature &ndash; that is to say, a case-by-case fraction-specific application.</p>
<p>So if you preprocess by removing the space after the integer, presumably you&rsquo;re only enclosing the fraction itself with the &lt;cotff:&gt; tags. This is not a problem, and the fraction will be properly styled with the appropriate numerator-fraction-denominator substitution. The preceding space is not required to trigger the substitution.</p>

<p>These are even substituted with an {afrc} alternate fraction feature, but I don&rsquo;t think that is supported in any software yet.</p>
<p>It would not be able to easily handle a double digit fraction like Charles&rsquo;s example of 11/16, except by some careful manual manipulation, like setting 1/1 next to 1/6 and kerning them until the fraction bar touches. Not elegant. And it wouldn&rsquo;t be of any use in a single-over-double situation.</p>

<p>For the life of me, I can&rsquo;t think of how to do the same thing with OpenType features. If somebody can, now <em>that</em> would be cooking!</p>

<p>Looks like maybe you&rsquo;re pulling numerators and denominators (or superscripts &amp; subscripts) from a separate Pi font and centering them both within an advance space and drawing a rule for the nut fraction bar.</p>
<p>Seems like to do this in OpenType, you&rsquo;d have to do something like what Nick was intimating with zero set widths and/or negative kern pairs. But that kind of coding is beyond my patience (unless, I suppose, I&rsquo;m ever presented with the problem over and over).</p>
<p><cite> &gt; How typographers are able to mix the artistic with coding and math, I’ll never know.</cite></p>
<p>Perhaps this is getting to the essence of the difference between a  designer/typographer and a compositor/typographer.</p>
