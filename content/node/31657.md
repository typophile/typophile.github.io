  is the type of code page I choose going to effect the font I make or can I choose
  any code page and still get the same results?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\n\r\nRachelR

  body: "Rachel, \r\n\r\nthe only thing that matters in OpenType fonts is that each
    glyph has an appropriate name and an appropriate Unicode codepoint. The codepages,
    encodings and Unicode ranges are for orientation only. They are not stored inside
    of OpenType fonts (unless you set the FontLab Studio Preferences to enable some
    special encoding options.)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"

  body: "If your glyph is a default representation of a Unicode character, just pick
    the codepage, Unicode range or encoding in which this glyph is listed, and double-click
    on an empty glyph cell to create a blank glyph. A glyphname and a Unicode codepoint
    will be assigned automatically. (If you know the correct glyphname for your glyph,
    you can use Glyph / Generate Glyphs and type it there.) If your glyph is not a
    default representation of a Unicode character (i.e. it's a ligature, a variant
    glyph etc.), you need to name the glyph according to the recommendations described
    in the \"Glyph Naming and Encoding\" section of the FontLab Studio manual. \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "A good codepage to begin with is MS Windows 1252 Western.\r\nIf you complete
    all those characters, you will get basic cross-platform compatability.\r\nActually,
    once you've done that, it's very easy to also do 1250 European, because if you
    have the separate characters and accents, FontLab automatically makes the composite
    characters, all you have to do is click on the grey box.\r\n\r\nWhen you generate
    your font, in \"Font Info > Encoding and Unicode\", clicking on the magic green
    diamond will automatically tell you which code pages the characters you have created
    for your font will support."
