  on at home a bit... while the InDesign file is fine, all of the typeface files are
  zero bytes and don't work! Hmm...  figured it was just a weird thing, so I tried
  it again, and also emailed the typeface to me (both zipped up, and by attaching
  each file singularly). And again... zero bytes.\r\n\r\nI am at a loss - very strange
  problems. Any ideas?"

    Internet counted as a non-Mac machine, so perhaps this is my problem!   thx.
