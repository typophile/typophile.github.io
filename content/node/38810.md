body: "Around the middle of 2004 after a dispute with a local ISP, fontalicious.com
  went from being a popular independent font foundry to an error page. Eventually
  the domain was snapped up by no less than 3 owners over the subsequent years, all
  overseas and none with any intention to return the domain to Ben Balvanz, the creator
  of Fontalicious.\r\n\r\nFrom that time, the site became a series of landing pages
  for banner ads or link pages but by this time, Ben had indeed moved on and became
  deeply invovled in the creation of the wildy successful apparel company Fan Club
  Member under the Gobitron, Inc. umbrella. Many folks had thought something had happened
  to Ben and even more companies were looking to legally license works that there
  was no manner to contact the author as more and more of the massive Fontalicious
  library started showing up on free font sites . . .\r\n\r\nIn 2005 when the idea
  of Font Bros began, Fontalicious was among the first foundries my partner Mike and
  I approached and Ben was open to the idea of us beginning to retail his fonts again.
  At that time, we learned of the backstory about how the fontalicious.com domain
  ended up in limbo and began our efforts to try to track down the owner of the domain
  to try and accquire it again . . .\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as the demand for his library
  grew, he gained renewed interest in font creation and has been hard at work on releasing
  new typeface designs. But even with new designs, without the domain it would be
  left to Google to help folks find Ben and his work . . .\r\n\r\nIt turned out since
  Ben and his partner had the foresight to trademark the name Fontalicious back in
  2001, we had a legal claim to the domain and could pursue working with ICANN to
  resolve the domain dispute but we didn't want to incurr the estimated $6k in legal
  fees to get to the point of arbitration.\r\n\r\nAt some point a while later, the
  domain was acquired by yet another party who like the previous ones had many domains
  but fortunately for us he took the domain to sedo.com a domestic domain broker and
  for the third time in 2 years we began a dialog to purchase the domain again. After
  a series of dialogs and excessive sales offers, the conversation stalled and so
  we began work with a domain broker at sedo.\r\n\r\nWe presented the trademark registration
  plus proof of the history of the domain and began the process of negociation again.
  The owner who didn't want any legal matters coming to his doorstep finally arrived
  at a fair price we all agreed on and after a few weeks of discussions, escrow transfers
  and name server updates, the Font Bros are proud to annouce fontalicious.com is
  back in the rightful hands of its owner and will be launching soon!\r\n\r\nBen is
  thrilled to have the domain under his control again and is working on the new website
  and even more amazing new fonts that made his type famous the world over.\r\n\r\nHead
  on over and sign up to be notified when the new Fontalicious.com is live again at
  <a href=\"http://www.fontalicious.com\">http://www.fontalicious.com</a>\r\n\r\nWarmly,\r\nMike
  & Stuart\r\nThe Font Bros"

  body: I've missed Fontalicious so much. It's good to hear it's coming back, and
    why it went away. I had no idea there was so much drama. Might be good enough
    to develop into a miniseries during the writers strike.
