  <BR> <BR>This is Digita 7.5, my first attempt at a bitmapped font, and Fontographer
  is obviously NOT the best tool to use for the endeavor, I discovered to my frustration.
  <BR> <BR>In any event, this size is designed at 11 points. It was designed with
  classical proportions in mind, more or less. The numerical suffix designates 7 pixels
  above the baseline, and an average width of 5 pixels per character. I&#39;m not
  entirely sure that this naming system will be as useful as it first seemed, but
  we&#39;ll see.... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">
  <BR> <BR>I really hope this displays properly. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":&#41;"> Your comments are welcome, and very much wanted.... <BR> <BR>David

    that wonderful &#34;Q&#34;&#41; is mostly a mess - sorry. <BR> <BR>The overall
    texture is pleasing, and some of the non-alphabetics are cool &#40;like the Pilcrow&#41;,
    so I&#39;d say you&#39;re mostly there! A couple of things: the zero is strange;
    I&#39;d lower the &#34;at&#34; by a pixel. <BR> <BR>If you can afford it, get
    BitFonter - it rocks. <BR> <BR>BTW, what&#39;s with the ankh?! Cool. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    <BR> <BR>Very nice flavor, as usual David. It has a woody  <BR>feel--like most
    of your stuff. In context, &#40;in  <BR>the sample text you provided&#41; the
    UC looks fine,  <BR>appropriate, etc. But the spacing, when you run  <BR>the UC
    alphabet together, looks like it needs  <BR>work. <BR> <BR>Finally, perhaps consider
    a double v for the W... '

  body: ' You&#39;re both right about the spacing &amp; kerning, of course, especially
    among the UC glyphs. <BR> <BR>As for the ankh, it&#39;s a part of all of my fonts.
    &#40;When was the last time you actually USED the infinity symbol, after all?
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> I relegate
    that one to the alternate set&#41;. The ankh fits in so well with the dagger and
    double dagger that I include it in all my fonts as a potentially useful symbol
    or ornament. I think every font should have one. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    <BR>Hrant: <BR> <BR>What about the UC isn&#39;t working? Is it just the spacing,
    or are there some other design considerations? <BR> <BR>As always, thanks for
    the input. <BR> <BR>David '

    caps &#40;like the &#34;B&#34; and &#34;W&#34;&#41;, overall I think you&#39;re
    applying the oldstyle divergent-width factor too strongly - like the &#34;E&#34;
    being really narrow - stuff like that. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' This is nice. Agree with the comments so far, and yes Hrant you were being
    a bit harsh. ;-&#41; Yes, perhaps the &#39;E&#39; is too narrow, and while I appreciate
    the idea behind the &#39;B&#39; perhaps it as well is a bit tricky. But that &#39;U&#39;
    is wonderful. The &#39;0&#39; looks like a football to these old eyes. I &#42;LOVE&#42;
    the &#39;g&#39; and the overall flavor. If you are attempting to show rubrication
    on the &#39;&para;&#39;, perhaps the thicker vertical stroke should be in the
    center. The &#39;fj&#39; ligature is too wide as perhaps is the &#39;ft&#39; lig.
    The idea of the  ankh is nice too. What if you lowered the cross stroke so you
    could elongate the opening and make it look less &#39;martian&#39; like too? '

    <BR> <BR>Okay newbie &#42;BIGTIME&#42; alert. This is why I like wonderful smell
    of old warn and loved books over the computer. I know how to turn a page. :-p  <BR>
    <BR>Hrant. This is what I meant by &#39;elongate&#39;. You are right by the way.
    Maybe my idea of an ankh is incorrect.

  body: ' Thanks for the suggestions, Hrant, Joe &amp; Tiffany. <BR> <BR>Hrant: You&#39;re
    right about the &#34;@&#34; &#40;at&#41;, and you and Tiffany are correct on the
    &#34;0&#34; &#40;zero&#41; as well. &#40;It seemed a good idea on paper.&#41;
    I&#39;ll try an approximation of a super-ellipse. <BR> <BR>Wish me luck designing
    the lower-case figures.... <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll re-examine the widths of the upper
    case set. I really do want to try to keep the classically narrow glyphs narrow,
    but one more pica might be in order, especially for UC &#34;E&#34;, &#34;F&#34;
    and maybe &#34;L&#34;. I think the UC &#34;B&#34; will work at its current width,
    but I may have to give up on the smaller upper curve. <BR> <BR>Joe: As far as
    that tricky UC &#34;W&#34; goes, I haven&#39;t &#40;yet&#41; been able to make
    the crossings work properly with the pixels, resulting in some extremely clogged
    glyphs. The result that you saw posted was the least objectionable of the various
    options that I tried. I&#39;ll give it another look, though -- in fact, I would
    prefer it if I could get the double-V to work. The true solution is out there,
    Scully.... <BR> <BR>...which leads us to the alien ankh. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>Tiffany: your suggestion makes perfect sense, and I will
    incorporate it, posthaste. I also like your idea on the &#34;&para;&#34; &#40;pilcrow&#41;,
    and I&#39;ll adjust the various ligature widths as I fine-tune the spacing and
    kerning problems. &#40;lc &#34;s&#34; seems especially troublesome in spacing
    &amp; kerning....&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m especially glad that the lc &#34;g&#34;
    and UC &#34;Q&#34; and &#34;U&#34; were appreciated. Those glyphs really hold
    the spirit of the font that I was trying to create. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for
    all of the great suggestions. Any others will be equally appreciated. <BR> <BR>David '
