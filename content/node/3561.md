  body: Red Rooster&#39;s Alghera and Unifonts Hudson Serif Rough are fairly similar.
    These and many other hand printed styles are from Part 6 of the Script Font ID
    Guide, if you want to look for others. I&#39;ve attached Alghera and Hudson Serif.
    The Rough version is a bit &#39;crustier&#39; looking, if that&#39;s part of what
    you wanted. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/28425.gif"

    target="_blank">Providence</a> is close, maybe too playful though. It also has
    a sans companion, as well as italics and smallcaps.

  body: That list of Stephen&#39;s will be a helpful one for me to find some new candidates
    for the Script Guide. I have many of them, but there are always a few more somewhere...
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for adding that Yves.
