  Sans]], except for this particular \"a\" (notice the stem):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/an_4598.JPG]\r\n\r\nThus
  I was wondering, whether that would indeed be Gill Sans all the same (with customised/edited
  \"a\", perhaps?...), or eventually an other font which I'm missing to get to?...\r\n\r\nThen
  again, this next one matches Gill Sans Bold, yet the \"t\" apparently not?... Again,
  an edited character alone, eventually?... Hmm...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/host_4269.JPG]\r\n\r\nMuch
  appreciated if you can please help clearing it up for me. :-)\r\n\r\n"

    Today, Bliss, Mundo, Agenda, Charlotte, Legato, Freight Sans, Kievit) but none
    of them was a perfect match.\r\n\r\n\"h\xF6st\" seems to be Gill Sans Bold. It
    may be a different cut than the one you looked at.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
