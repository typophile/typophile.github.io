  aware it may be custom as it appears to be replicating a type of vintage European
  sign-writing style.\r\nThe low crossbar in the A and the unusual S and C stand out
  the most.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cc_5804.jpg]"

  body: "Looks like lettering inspired by works of the Russian Constructivists of
    the 1920s and 30s, including Alexander Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova, Vladimir
    and George Stenberg, and Gustav Klutsis.\r\nFor angularity and a somewhat similar
    S, see for example  Bs-Kombat,\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/feliciano/bs-kombat/\r\nOther
    angulars in this group include ITC Stenberg\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/stenberg/\r\nand
    Rodchenko\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/rodchenko-cond/\r\nThe low
    crossbar A was a common Art Deco feature now found in some fonts, including Neutraface
    by House and Erbar by URW++\r\nC's like the image\r\nITC Terta bold\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/tetra-itc/\r\nKonstruct

  body: "Thank you very much for the replies.\r\nLooking at all those links fvilanakis's
    suggestion \"Teuton\" seems to be by far the closest. I think with some customising
    it could look quite close to the example in the OP.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else come
    across similar typefaces (in particular the \"S\" \"A\" and \"C\"), please post
    it up.\r\nThanks again!"
