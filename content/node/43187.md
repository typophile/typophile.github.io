  is an idea I have been working on.]]\r\n\r\nThese are a few other typefaces I have
  looked at (Phil Baines & Barbara Butterweck - both for FUSE).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/letterforms_6494.JPG]\r\n\r\nNow
  I am interested in what everybody has to say on the matter - what works? What doesn't?
  Everybody I have asked seems to be able to read my design with little trouble when
  used in display and they have said that it is easier to read from a distance. I
  know we often see word shapes and not just individual letter shapes and this is
  important. Enough of my misinformed generalisations - tell me what you think please.\r\n\r\nTom"

  body: "I think the T looks a little bit too much like the L.  Also you might try
    doing the Q as the G but with a lower crossbar instead of a trailing stroke.  I
    know I write my lowercase Gs and Qs identical except for it, and I went through
    a similar process a you did to simplify my handwriting.\r\n\r\nBut, looking very
    good.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta

  body: Russell, I notice you mention the issue of 'illegibility' and 'Guifa' you
    pointed out that some of my letters may be confused with others. Not that it would
    be of much use to anyone, how about a typeface which really makes it difficult
    to distinguish between different forms?

    designs.  But if I squint my eyes I can read it more or less okay (the W and M
    are the same, for instance).\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina

  body: I'd be interested in seeing more samples (not alphabetical) so that we can
    see if the letters are still unidentifiable when they're out of order.

  body: "Today I saw a logo on a moving truck that reminded me of this thread.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/isaac_cordoba_cut_letters_3444.jpg]\r\n\r\nAs
    you can see, while not as drastically chopped off as your examples (nor as nice
    looking), it shows what has been done,.  For example, the A I think most would
    not recognize if it were not for context, same for the S.  The R and the B I think
    could hvae some confusion as well.  But all put together, there is no trouble
    in reading it.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos
