  to get some critique...\r\n\r\nI'm putting together an identity for a friend's business,
  this is one of the logo candidates.\r\nI've had no experience in drawing a script
  face before, and wanted to know if anyone can spot any major bloopers?\r\n\r\nAn
  thoughts on the logo in general would be nice too :)"

    gets lost because of the image within it. The quality of the letters is light
    and airy and has a nice not over-done quality to it. \r\n\r\nWhat are your goals?"

  body: "If it's called 'T<strong>a</strong>p O'Noth Gundogs', the a in 'Tap' is not
    too clear imo. It could either be an 'o' or an 'a' (it is very similar to the
    'o' in Noth).\r\nThe O' indeed is a bit lost because of the image. I'm not sure
    if I like the fact that the 'tail' of the N is filled white when overlapping the
    O. And is it 'gundogs' or 'gundogds', like in your image?\r\n\r\nAnyway, apart
    from the critique I may have, the letters are very nicely done on themselves.
    Especially the Noth part, and the capital T. Keep it up."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo2b_5579.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks for the
    (lighting fast) feedback.\r\nAll excellent points :)\r\n\r\nI've reduced the roundness
    of the stalk in the \u2018a\u2019 and made the loop in the \u2018o\u2019 larger,
    hence distinguishing the letters better.\r\n\r\nI've moved the \u2018p\u2019 off
    the \u2018O\u2019 and taken out the white counters, which as suggested brings
    out the \u2018O\u2019 better and makes the whole thing more readable. A clearance
    area has also be made around the inside of the \u2018O\u2019 to try and stop the
    image hiding it.\r\n\r\nAnd err.. gundogds :| it\u2019s late !"

  body: "The 'a' in Tap is actually much more readable now, nice one :)\r\nThe clearance
    in the 'O' does work, it's more an 'O' now. However it still also does look like
    a frame for the image a bit."

  body: "I didn't see the 'O' as well. Not sure if putting the dog inside works. The
    curve where the bottom of the 'T' loops back towards the left looks kind of strange.
    It should flow a little better. Also, watch your apostrophe. It's looking like
    an inch mark.\r\n\r\nHaving said this, I really like your script's style.\r\n\r\n

    are a little unbalanced compared to the ap of Tap. The top of the dog\u2019s head
    looks a little flat.\r\nTim"

    a loop on the top right as an exit stroke. You'll probably have to make the dog
    smaller, or put the loop behind the dog.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    the suggested changes. \r\nLex, I was thinking about making the 'O' more handwritten
    :)\r\ntimd, thanks for the spot on those verticals, its difficult to notice these
    things when you've been staring at it for hours."
