  body: Looks to me like a badly redrawn version of <a href="http://www.urw.de/cgi-bin1/dalcgi/english/schnellsuche.htd?searchchar=roberta&amp;image.x=0&amp;image.y=0">Roberta</a>.
    &#40;The URW page says it was designed in 2003, but I&#39;m sure that refers to
    the digital version. I found it first in an old phototype specimen book.&#41;

    Apparently it was used on many restaurant signages and was based on a European
    handcut sign.
