body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a really beautiful Sans Serif font for
  a logo I'm designing for a Health Care Business. I wondered if anyone could suggest
  something. I don't mind buying something new if I haven't already got it in my small
  collection.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "There are so many different options. Have you thought about what kind of
    atmosphere you're looking for? Should it be friendly or clinical? Have you also
    done research in what kind of typefaces are currently being used in the industry
    and how you would like to stay with this style or select something contrasting?
    I could name random beautiful sans typefaces but I like to put more thought behind
    it. Typefaces shouldn't be selected merely because they're beautiful. You need
    to consider your target audience and the atmosphere you're going for as well.\r\n\r\nSo,
    could you give more information on what you're doing? Can you give the name of
    the business and do you have a symbol to show?"
