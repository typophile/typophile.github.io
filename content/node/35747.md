  body: Do you have any more bibliographic information? Very interesting that Sunday
    is noted with a fraktur. That seems historically archaic as if to say Sunday being
    a holy day is still set apart with a holy typeface.

  body: "What sort of \"old\" are you talking about here?  This looks like something
    from the 1950s/1960s, and that would be sympathetic with the Sunday fractur.\r\n\r\nThe
    rest of the letters are vaguely Caslon (<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/caslon-rough/\">Rough</a>
    is close-ish, except for the r), but the numbers aren't anywhere near that...."
