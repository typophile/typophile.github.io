  ordering but to hold it together. For example Page 1/3, Page 2/3, Page 3/3. It just
  makes me feel safer because an incomplete copy is clearly marked as incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe
  audience are recruiters who rush through resumes are an alarming pace. From what
  I can gather, their eyes track the page top-left to bottom-right and if they get
  distracted or did not see what they are looking for, its in the bin.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  with such a short collection of pages, some folio positions just do not work. For
  example, if you bleed the right hand edge then Page 3/3 causes them to look for
  Page 4/3 and they get confused (witnessed it first hand). While that is not an immediate
  problem for most jobs, its clearly flawed and may reflect badly if applying for
  design-related jobs - so its in the bin.\r\n\r\nSo where should they go? :)"

    something that folio placement isn't going to solve. \r\n\r\nAlso, a three page
    resume is probably two pages too long, especially if it's going to people who
    are just skimming them. Edit it down to something short and digestible. \r\n"

    the longer version for the few people who will actually sit down and read it."

  body: "Thing is, I do not know who is going to read it. Those awful personnel departments
    tend to sift through resumes before giving a list to recruiters.\r\n\r\nSometimes
    they OCR the document and use computers to scan for keywords. That's a problem
    that my thread is not addressing :)\r\n\r\nHi Jackson, could you please elaborate?
    I will confess to having too much to put in my resume. My last career advisor
    was really stuck and told me to take out education because it was the weakest
    part (I am postgraduate)."

    resume, the solution isn't going to be adding more information (folios). You need
    to edit down (a lot) and make the information skim-able (by adjusting your typographic
    hierarchy).  \r\n\r\n<cite>- I will confess to having too much to put in my resume.</cite>\r\n\r\nThere
