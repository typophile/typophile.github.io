<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>ok a very rough idea of the book is attached..
the first double page is using cage's rhythmic structure, and second a basic story passage, thirdly a more decorative poem...
any comments would be great!
Secondly.. I was going to call it 'Generated Poetry', but now it isn't just poetry... short stories are included as well. I want the book to be slightly humanistic to contrast with the computer generated spam (hence the layout). So far possible titles are:
- Generated Language
- Generated Voice
- Generated Prose
- Generated Sonant
- Generated Utterance
Generated could be replaced with:
Manufactured/Created/Automated
What I want from the title is a contrast, unfortunately my grasp of the English Language is not so great.
Thanks for any suggestions.

<div class=commentbody>The decorative poem looks good, the trouble with critting this is the limitless options, a hundred different designers would probably do it a hundred different ways. The short story layout is a bit wide in the measure and the margins seem out of balance, the middle margins are a bit broad. For the Cage style you could look at justifying the right margin (while still keeping the aligned punctuation).
As for the title I quite like Generated Voices, (or perhaps Received Voices), the plural adds to the humanist feel to me.

I agree on the plural actually...
I thought of emphatic automation.. but i think its a 'trying too hard'
