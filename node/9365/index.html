<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm on Justin Howes' mailing list. This morning I was shocked and saddened to receive an email from his parents via his list saying that he had died unexpectedly yesterday. <br> <br>The most recent message I had received from Justin was an announcement that at the end of this month he was to join the staff of the Museum Plantin-Moretus for six months to help research the Plantin types. <br> <br>Justin is known for his facsimile revivals of Caslon's types (see the <a href=http://www.hwcaslon.com/ target=_blank>H.W. Caslon site</a>).</div>

<div class=commentbody>What a shock. How sad and unexpected. <br>We've lost a knowledgable and nice guy - a very nice guy. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>Me too. <br> <br>I "knew" Justin mostly in that virtual online sense, though we met briefly once or twice at conferences. I gave him some tips on OpenType development, and he asked lots of very reasonable questions. <br> <br>Recently Adobe had an issue with our next-gen apps and ITC Founders Caslon, which he was a great help in debugging. It turned out to be something I decided to fix on our end, but he would have been happy to revise his fonts if it would help. <br> <br>Justin was always friendly, courteous, intellectually engaged, and when it came to design/technology decisions quite focused on the actual users of his typeface. <br> <br>My last non-mass email from him was two weeks ago today. <br> <br>It all feels very unreal, somehow. <br>Goodbye, Justin. <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sent from <a href=http://www.stbride.org/index.htm target=_blank>Friends of St Bride</a> today: <br> <br>A service of thanksgiving for Justin's life will be held in St Bride <br>church on 9 May 2005 at 3pm. <br> <br>Justin was one of the strongest supporters of the Friends and his <br>untimely death will be keenly felt. He was responsible for <br>re-establishing the Friends in 1998 and was our Chairman until 2003. <br>Since then Justin has continued to support us, giving gifts to the <br>library up to a few weeks ago. Without Justin the Friends would simply <br>not exist and we will always be indebted to him. The Friends was not the <br>only cause that Justin championed. It was largely thanks to his efforts <br>that the archives of the Sheffield based typefounders Stephenson Blake <br>were preserved in the Type Museum. Until recently Justin also worked in <br>the Type Museum as part-time curator. <br> <br>Always busy with many projects, Justin always found the time to share <br>his knowledge with others and many of us will miss his help and advice <br>as well as his friendship. Over the years he made many contributions in <br>the field of printing history beginning with articles in Matrix and Isis <br>while studying as an undergraduate at Christ Church College, Oxford. He <br>then edited Edward Johnston's Lessons in formal writing with Heather <br>Child, published by Lund Humphries in 1986. A year later he published a <br>catalogue of the Edward Johnston Collection at the Crafts Study Centre <br>at Bath University. He remained fascinated by Johnston and later wrote <br>Johnston's underground type, published by Capital Transport in 2000. He <br>also published in numerous journals and lectured across the country and <br>abroad on a number of different subjects. <br> <br>Justin was a typographer as well as a printing historian. He was <br>responsible for designing many books, some quite sumptuous, but will be <br>remembered in particular for his masterful digital version of the Caslon <br>typeface. <br> <br>Perhaps the saddest thing about Justin's death is that he left so many <br>projects unfinished, some of which had been long-term ambitions that <br>were soon to bear fruit -- his six-month stay at the Plantin-Moretus <br>Museum in Antwerp and his PhD on the development of letterforms and <br>concepts of lettering, 1680–1830 to name but two. <br> <br>Our thoughts are with his parents at this time. <br> <br>Justin's obituary in The Times: <br><a href=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0%2C target=_blank>1-45-1505298%2C00.html,http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-45-1505298,00.html</a></div>
