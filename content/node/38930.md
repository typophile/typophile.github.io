  body: Actually the FontDiner freebies are only free for personal use (says so in
    the readme). Since most of us around here are pros that makes them payfonts.

  body: I discovered Fontdiner way back when I was doing my first web design. I bought
    their Fontdinerdotcom Loungy font. They have excellent fonts and great service
    and if was made of money I'd invest in their Machine Wash filters. Good stuff.

    said, \"Even with freeware be sure to 'Read the EULA' because you will be surprised
    how many foundries offering freeware/shareware fonts actually have restrictions
    applied to them.\" Blambot for instance. \r\n\r\nQuote: \"This font is freeware
    for independent comic book creation and \r\nnon-profit use ONLY. ( This excludes
    use by \"mainstream\" publishers,\r\n(Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, Oni, Image, SLG,
    Top Cow, Crossgen and their \r\nsubsidiaries) without a license fee. Use by a
    \"mainstream\" publisher \r\n(or it's employee), and use for commercial non-comic
    book production \r\n(eg. magazine ads, merchandise lables etc.) incurs a license
    fee \r\nbe paid to the designer, Nate Piekos. \""
