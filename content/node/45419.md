body: "hello all, i have a litho print problem and was wondering whether someone on
  here can help... and so you know from the off i am from a digital background with
  minimal Litho experience.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Ive designed a CMYK image with black background
  (c100 m100 y100 k100) and various coloured layers in photoshop that use several
  different blend options (colour dodge/linear dodge/linear colour). However (and
  unlike digital print) Ive since been told by our Artworker that the black will be
  printed 4 times making it really thick/slow drying/shiny etc.. so ive tried dropping
  back the background black to C10 M0 Y0 K100 - making it a dark grey but printer
  friendly colour. The trouble is now that the overall colour has lost all its vibrancy
  since it was dependent on the Black for the Blend Layers to work.\r\n\r\nDoes any
  one have any thoughts, tips, ideas or directions that id find useful at this point?
  I dont want to sacrifice the lovely black colour for a dark grey colour if i can
  help it.\r\n\r\nthanks."

    could up that TIC (Total Ink Coverage) to around 350%. Provided fastdrying (UV),
    highintensity inks are used (Toyo \u2014 Japanese inks to be brighter), you might
    achieve something close to what you want.\r\nDo some tests with different rich
    blacks and your effects. Flatten and sample the darker areas with the pipet in
    the Proofsimulation of PhotoShop. Or make PDF's and check in Acrobat for TIC-limits.\r\n\r\nAnother

  body: "thanks bert for the information - that really will help me make the black
    more of a 'richer' black at the print process end, but after playing with it some
    more ive got a feeling my issue might now be a photoshop technical issue. \r\n\r\nIt
    seems to be the various layers blend modes (which are dependent on the background
    colour having the black a solid black, so  the CMYK settings are right up allowing
    the layers to react the way they do - all saturated). Im just after a solid black
    background but with the sae level of saturation on the colours... something im
    not sure now might be possible :(\r\n\r\nAnyway, Ive provided two cropped images
    from the file im working on which hopefully demonstrate my predicament. The first
    image being the original with solid black, while the second is the black background
    set to C10 M0 Y0 K100 - big difference in my opinion.\r\n\r\nOne - http://imgplace.com/image/view/a66ac6354132fa92437cfc47302e5ff1\r\n\r\nTwo

    flatten the whole file and adjust the saturation to bring your less dense black
    up to scratch, this may however, still be problematic, as that black will still
    have values from all 4 colours. Depending on your print spec, you could run the
    whole job with your 100% K/10% C then hit the black again with a % of the K. This,
    naturally, depends on the press your job is being output on.\r\n\r\nI've just

    really of what you'll get out of the printer, litho or digital. I think what you're
    seeing just happens to be Photoshop's on-screen reaction to your CMYK values and
    these won't be reproduced when you print.\r\n\r\nI also think you need to Google
    \"rich black\" too. Full 100% on all four colours is only ever used for registration
    and other marks. You'd never print that.\r\n\r\nEssentially though your screen
    isn't adequate to accurately proof your composition as its gamut will be different
    to that of the CMYK process. Downloading the colour profile of the output device
    might help, but the only way to judge it would be to have a chromalin or digital
    proof made."

    you know you cant provide RGB files for 4-plate cos the printer/tech will simply

    and as you have witness, becomes a mess. If you are using a quality printer -
    you can make a black that has a value of 280 total. That is about the highest
    range a printer can get away with. Most  commercial printers want way less than
    that - and one even told me for a richer black all he'd give me was 10c 100k --
    it was awful.\r\n\r\nThanks for photoshop - most artist don't realize they are
    using a 75c 68m 67y 90k breakdown.\r\n\r\nOne artist in NY would have us use 25c
    90m 70y 100k as his standard.\r\n\r\nI am trying to understand why the black would
    be printed 4 times. If they are on a press that can handle 4 colors, those get
    printed at the same time - if they are on a press that is one color - then each
    color would be printed separately - but not black 4xs.\r\n\r\nI'll pass this on

  body: "Rez Oo: yeah, that % of K overprint to make it darker wont work as olho says
    is correct, its a photoshop issue, not a print issue. If i flatten the image then
    thats still the grey version with <100% CMYK.\r\n\r\nIll just have to play with
    the image to try and make  the grey look as good as it can, i guess.\r\n\r\nOne
    crazy/long-winded option which i was going to try was to flatten the whole image
    bar the background black, then add a drop shadow of 0 distance to the top image
    so it adds a black>white gradient over the whole image whilst retaining the blend
    modes. Then layer that over a cutout of the black background - the cutout would
    be that of the top layer with a inner shadow into white. the idea being that the
    graduation will allow the top image to retain its Black undertone colours whilta
    the background still has the C10% K100 setting. id oubt it'll work but its worth
    a shot..  "

    a black as what appears on your screen, but black nonetheless. I'm wondering if
    your monitor isn't calibrated well, which may be causing black (K100) in photoshop
    showing up much lighter than your rich black (C100 M100 Y100 K100).\r\n\r\nThe

  body: "I'm back. Okay, I sent this on to hubby, who has more years in printing then
    most of us have lived. Here is what he wrote back (I hope this helps)\r\n*********\r\nI
    have several questions I would like answered--\r\nYou say you are printing this
    on a litho press. Is this a single color press or a 4 color press (does the press
    print one color per pass or all four colors in one pass.).\r\nDo you know the
    name, make of the press?\r\n\r\n\r\nAll printers and all presses are not created
    equal.\r\n\r\n\r\nI assume you have prepared this as a photshop CMYK image and
    created your colors (including those that require black \r\nform the photshop
    palette. You have created a background black form the palette using 100% of yellow,
    100 magenta, 100 % cyan and 100% black. This is equal to 400% of color.\r\n\r\nMulti
    color, (4 or more color presses), Offset (litho) presses cannot print this in
    one pass. the ink will not trap properly nor dry properly. Most good printers
    can print up to 320%-340% of color in small areas and up to 320% in large areas.
    \ Most printers will ask for no more\r\nthan 280% of color in any one color, although
    they can print more using good high quality inks and paper and have a good pressman.\r\n\r\nAn
    understanding of trapping on multi color presses. When printing wet colors over
    each other the inks have to trap similar in oil painting so they do not blend
    into each other and destroy the integrity of the color. For example if you print
    100% magenta over 100% yellow if the ink traps properly (the magenta stays on
    top of the yellow as the ink dries then you get a nice bright red. If the ink
    does not trap properly and the yellow ink starts to mix in with the magenta ink
    as it dries the final color will come out more orange looking than a bright red
    depending on how poorly it trapped. and the drying process will be slowed down.\r\n\r\nHow
    to get a good deep black. there is more than one black, (warm black vs. cold black)
    I assume you want a nice deep cool black with as much gloss as possible. Today's
    modern ink companies do not make a good process black ink. This has to do with
    the lack of petroleum based lamp black pigments in the market place. Todays inks
    are manufactured with environmental friendly pigments which do not yield the density
    necessary to make a good rich black in a single pass of black ink. There are several
    ways to achieve what you are looking for.\r\n\r\nOne way is to prepare the black
    area with the following color percentages. 100% Black, 78% cyan,  64% magenta,
    63% yellow. This equals 305% of color. This will yield you a good deep dark black
    if you are on a modern offset (litho) press with a good pressman.\r\n\r\nThe other
    way to achieve an even better black is to print the black a 2 hit of black but
    still over the yellow, magenta and cyan.\r\nI would recommend the following.  50%
    yellow, 50% magenta 65% cyan 90% black, and then 100% black.\r\n\r\nAre you printing
    this on a gloss coated paper or a regular offset sheet? If you are not using a
    coated gloss sheet but rather a plain vellum finish offset sheet then I would
    recommend the 2 hits of black to achieve what you are looking for.\r\n\r\nAl"

  body: "Hi there. Black again, huh?  When making black backgrounds (we are talking
    about solid blacks) either in photoshop or whatever, to be printed as four color
    process (or cmyk if you will) make a rich black. The best I have seen is 32c 22m
    22y 100k.\r\nWhen doing artwork in photoshop that requires trapping (you will
    judge if it needs trapping) : make the trapping yourself. Preview at 100% size
    and look to see if something goes wrong; some small type or hairline can go nots.
    Remember: it is not that the printer did not used a program to trap the CT files
    (tifs, jpgs, psds, even the gifs that some people use from time to time), the
    thing is: I have heard of prepress workflows that trap CTs (such as Artwork systems,
    Nexus - from Belgium, very good), but in the praxis it DOES NOT WORK! They say
    it does and that I have to protest and turn my face the other way.\r\nAS for line
    work, 1 bit tifs, vector, trapping works anywhere, assuming that the rip has a
    trapping application.\r\n\r\nTo put it simple, if the image is a CT (continuous
    tone) then you trap it if it requires. If not, the printer will take care of it.
    Graphic designer don't have to worry about trapping issues that much. In illustrator
    there is a overprint setting, i think by defaut, that make objects overprint,
    and if you are not aware (i think you can check a option on preferencies to show
    the overprints) is a problem sometimes. If there is way to proof things before
    going to press, do it.\r\n\r\nJackie, sorry for your loss. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    start relying in the technology and hire unexperienced operators (which lowers
    the paychecks for the whole...).\r\n\r\nI suggest you check you artwork carefully,
    while doing it. Say, your cover will be in photoshop, then you take care of trapping
    it, flat it and save as tif or psd eps if you want to keep the vector info with
    the file. When it is mix, tifs (don't use jpgs, they work but funny stuff happens)
    and text and vector, make sure the images are flat tifs. Sometimes there are transparencies
    issues on pdfs, just check'em carefully before submitting to the printer. And
