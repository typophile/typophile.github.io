  work and a truly fresh approach IMO."

    yves' thunder. >^P Or maybe you could work together and we could get a dialog
    going. anyhow, i just thought that'd be interesting.

    of this font looked very playful and exhuberant--none of the stuffiness that is
    sometimes the aura of black letter. They looked great there and I can imagine
    in other informal settings where you wanted that playful mood and had a large
    size they might be great as well. But a *lot* of uses, no. '

    1960; a straighforward poster kind of thing is ok for me, but that's about it.
    Especially done as a script. When I see all the 50's retro stuff, the charm of
    it is lost on me. It may just be my age, but I don't think it will look good in
    another ten years either. \r\n\r\nFor me Dolly and Sauna are wonderful. "

    very well at smaller sizes. It has a distinct flavour and is quite legible when
    used correctly, it would appear. \r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of these guys, and they've
    already proven they know exactly what they're doing: Dolly, Sauna, Auto. Dolly
    in particular is an exemplary text font."
