  the Kr\xF6ller-M\xFCller Museum will show work by one of the participating artists,
  Ana Maria Tavares. Tavares is fascinated with water. The workings of the water in
  the streams in and around Park Sonsbeek in Arnhem inspired her work, both in Sonsbeek
  and at this museum. During her investigations, she discovered some 80 springs in
  the vicinity, flowing into a large number of streams. The names of these springs
  \u2013 along with the mantra \u2018Desire, Deserve, Delight, Still Life, Sparkling
  Water, Still Water, Sparkling Life\u2019 are part of \u2018Chrystal Waters\u2019.
  This object, specially made for the museum consists of stacked layers of reflecting
  coloured acrylic glass. The mantra also appears in the net of ribbons that was carried
  as a banner in the Sonsbeek Procession and now makes up the installation, in combination
  with \u2018Chrystal Waters\u2019 and a map of locations. The installation will be
  on display until January 31 in one of the museum's project rooms.\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\n+++\r\n\r\nAnother

    like a sad room for such a conceptual piece. I love the idea of it representing
    water although I first saw <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/media/rm1777178880/tt0198781\">Sulley</a>.
    Cool use of your typeface. Congratulations.\r\n"

    funny :-)\r\n\r\nIt could have looked better in another room, but you also have
    to take in account my lousy camera and camera work. It looked better in the real
    world. The entrance is near the back (where my wife stands looking at the ribbons)
    and the first view from that was really great. It *did* work for me, but I must
    confess that I was a bit distracted because she used my type :-)"
