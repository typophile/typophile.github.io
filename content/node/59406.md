  Sharon Collins talks about FLOOD BOOK and notions of readable text. Audrey Bennett
  and Ellen Lupton are cited. \r\n\r\nhttp://nancysharoncollinsstationer.com/gd4.php\r\n\r\nIn
  2005 Audrey Bennett spoke on this topic at Typecon in Boston, she and I have exchanged
  emails about this, infrequently, ever since.  I was interested in her talk because
  I was then teaching graphic design and typography at a university literally down
  the bayou in south Louisiana where illiteracy rates soar.  Recently at an AIGA leadership
  retreat in  Portland, OR, I ran into Audrey who I had not seen since Boston.  I
  was very excited to show her a book I designed and was amazed to discover that she
  had just purchased a copy.\r\n\r\nFLOOD BOOK, * as it is named, is a post-Katrina
  rant\u2014or repetitive chant\u2014with rhyming verse written in Yat which is a
  local, New Orleanian dialect. Its a little book, the size of a short novella, with
  compelling illustrations and simple, classical type.  I wanted Audrey to see it
  because it became a sell out as a tool for teaching reading to those with severe
  literacy challenges.   Why had she picked-up the book and what was it that inspired
  her to buy it?  In this presentation I will talk about the typographic and design
  choices in the FLOOD BOOK project, the coincidence with Audrey and how Dr. Caroline
  Musselwhite, assistive technology specialist working in the areas of AAC and literacy,
  found the book useful in her workshops.  \r\n\r\nFLOOD BOOK will be on sale at the
  SOTA book store."
