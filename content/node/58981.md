  body: "Mike, apparently it's a font called [[https://store.portlandstudios.com/#/details/1e79a4e0-ad96-420e-9f03-4978440745c0|Blue
    Goblet]] which has an alternate face. Between them you can get the same result
    as your sample.\r\n\r\nThe blue background sample doesn't look like it, but click
    on the \"view detail\" link to see the font sample that matches.\r\n\r\n- Mike
