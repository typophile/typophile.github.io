  all the characters in a font (Cyrillic, Latin): A so-called full character set (ABCDE,
  abcde ...etc. In InDesign, I can select character by character, but it takes a very
  long time (the current font is more than 800 characters). Is there any software,
  script or similar that does this work? Thanks in advance for prompt assistance ;-)"

    is written for Mac OSX Snow Leopard, so it might not work on your system. But
    it does what it says on the tin: write the character <em>code</em> of each Unicode
    character defined in the font into a plain text file.)"
