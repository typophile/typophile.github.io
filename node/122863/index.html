  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m new here and I&rsquo;m also new to type design. Having said that, I&rsquo;ve been drawing type since I was a child and eventually grew up a little and became a graphic designer along the way. My hobby is now taking a serious turn as it&rsquo;s about time I tried to share and even sell my typeface designs. My first attempt was a hand drawn, all caps, neoclassical serif face that I named &lsquo;Carrig&rsquo;. Carrig being the Irish word for &lsquo;rock&rsquo; (I&rsquo;m based in Ireland) and the typeface itself was strongly influenced by classic letterforms carved into stone and weathered by time.</p>
<p>So, now I am developing Carrig into a full family and here, with the Roman weight, I have drawn a full set of lowercase characters to suit the style of their uppercase parents.</p>
<p>Before I release this to the world, I would absolutely love some considered criticism (or praise!) so that I may improve it. As I am a novice, I am a little bit wary of making &ldquo;schoolboy errors&rdquo; and any advice anyone here can give will be greatly appreciated. And&hellip; as this is my first post, I promise to become involved with the community – if you&rsquo;ll have me :)</p>
<p>You can look at further examples on my website – [[http://paulogoode.com/carrig-roman-typeface|Carrig Roman]]</p>

<p>Thank you @Catharsis, before publishing this I had loosened the kerning on each individual letter as it was much tighter, I will view again. I can&rsquo;t see the leaning issue myself, but then again, I&rsquo;m so close to this, it&rsquo;s hard to step back and be objective&hellip; hence coming here for opinions. I will check my axes once more. Thank you!</p>

<p>My next question to anyone would be, is my font saleable? Is it too similar to another? I&rsquo;ve been heavily influenced by Baskerville and the inscriptions from the Trajan column, is that obvious and therefore detrimental? Or do you see Carrig having its own merits and personality?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a conscious decision to avoid any straight lines in the letterforms (punctuation excepted) with the aim of giving  the typeface a natural warmth and friendliness&hellip; does that come across?</p>
<p>Thanks again for your considered opinions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You can say that again @Glider (sorry – it had to be said!). Fair comment about the x-height being big, that&rsquo;s been a deliberate decision because it&rsquo;s my first proper attempt at font creation and I&rsquo;m designing via a combination of what I like and what feels intuitive. My original drawings (16 years ago) were calligraphic, hence the remnants of a hand drawn/unfinished style that you&rsquo;re picking up on and, as a strong influence, I&rsquo;ve always loved how (some) Garamonds have an open /P bowl. I&rsquo;m leaning towards keeping the /P and /R open to retain personality and differentiation, but will definitely look at joining the /Q.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

What about open it too? I’m thinking of a gap at the bottom of the circle, while the right part of the bowl joins the tail.

(brutally ham-fisted chopping to illustrate the idea)
<p>By the way, I very much like the flow of your |g| (though perhaps it could be very slightly wider at the bottom left).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that&rsquo;s its big selling point, a generous x-height and classical warmth at the same time. People looking for both don&rsquo;t have a lot to choose from. I think this is because ever since ITC turned Garamond into plastic in 1975, everyone has been warning against doing that again, while laying all the blame on one attribute.</div>
