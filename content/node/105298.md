  too expensive to purchase in our budget. Does anybody know of anything that's as
  close as possible and a bit cheaper?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BentonModernFour-Roman_3484.jpg]"

  body: I've emailed them to find out. I'm basing the cost on Benton Modern Display
    and just want to see if there's a cheaper alternative. Unfortunately, nobody wants
    to spend money nowadays so I'm just looking at ways to bring the cost down, no
    matter how small!

    come to mind. \r\n\r\nOther Clarendon-style fonts that are similar include: News
    No. 2, Clarion, ITC Century, and Century 725.\r\n\r\nHappy hunting...."

    cost:\r\n\r\nComplete family (16 styles, 2-5 user license): $1920\r\nTwo styles
    (2-5 user license): $320\r\n\r\nThey don't do a single user license - works out
    quite expensive!"

    by applying a small amount of Stroke in applications such as InDesign.\r\nThat
    would make Century Expanded look quite like Benton Modern Four.\r\nHowever, proper
    foundry grading is superior\u2014as can be seen from this before-and-after demonstration:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Stone_4751.png]"
