  shape formed by the upper strokes of the letters? I am a little confused about this\u2014in
  part because typography texts tend to explain the phenomenon with simplified diagrams
  of boxy shapes of words and/or the negative spaces above them."

    and descending box around the words. In <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx>Kevin
    Larson's paper on reading</a>, he defines bouma as the word shape/outline.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    ... and then goes on to say that it's not how reading psychologists believe reading
    occurs."

  body: "I am curious: what are you reading? \r\n\r\nHowever - the simple answer is
    yes.  The Counters are part of the Bouma.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting though that
    depending on who you talk to Bouma will likely to mean slightly different things.
    There is an effort to make these terms more precise but it should probably be
    seen as an evolving term.\r\n\r\nStill, if you like I will have short stab at
    it in layman-ish language & then give you some links. \r\n\r\nIt is a little hard
    to talk about Bouma without giving some context I think. So... For the sake of
    argument let's say that on a Neurological/Perceptual level there is a 'sensory
    impression'. When we start to investigate what that is and how it's sensed by
    the body we will notice that the sensory impression has two areas of interest
    for us - the part is in focus on ( the Foveal ) & the part outside of focus but
    which is also in fact 'seen' in the sense that it is part of seeing ( the Parafoveal
    ). These are anatomical and also Neurological distinctions. The Fovea has a greater
    density of light receptors.\r\n\r\nSo then back to the Bouma. Hrant once wrote
    \"According to my lectures in cognitive science, the combined outer *and* inner
    outlines (but in blurry, para-foveal form) of a word is what we rely on the most;
    and that\u2019s in fact the bouma.\u201D This emphasizes the Parafoveal use of
    the Bouma. This emphasis is why I bring up the Foveal & Parafoveal. \r\n\r\nMy
    understanding is that in some sense the Bouma exits in both but will be differently
    available to be perceived and differently emphasized by the brain.\r\n\r\nThe
    term 'Bouma' is a way of describing the stimulus provided to vision by the counters,
    all the black parts ( assuming a 'black' text on 'white' ), and the white around
    glyphs. I am deliberately avoiding the term word here because it seems to be agreed
    that the Bouma is not limited by words. Instead it is the Bouma that helps to
    identify what is a 'word'.\r\n\r\nIt might be useful to look at the term Notan
    as well.\r\n\r\nI encourage the Bouma oriented here at Typophile to correct any
    mis-assertions I may have made.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/15432\r\nand\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/13763\r\n\r\nThis

  body: "Thanks for the great response, Eben. As for what I\u2019m reading, well,
    that\u2019s a long list. There\u2019s the usual roster of design textbooks\u2014<em>Thinking
    With Type</em>, <em>Stop Stealing Sheep</em>, <em>Typographic Design: Form and
    Communication</em>, <em>A Type Primer</em>, I\u2019ll stop there\u2014along with
    all the various articles written for laymen and designers that I have come across,
    and now I am getting into Unger\u2019s <em>While You\u2019re Reading</em>. For
    me the confusion comes from most of this stuff just glossing over the concept
    and never bringing up the details, aside from mentioning that big counters are
    better, and I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve yet spotted the term bouma outside
    the Typophile forums.\r\n\r\nBut I am doing my senior thesis work, and it involves
    highly legible typefaces designed for use in a variety of media, so the more I
    know about this stuff the better."

  body: 'I am glad it was helpful. BTW it is even possible I suppose that Kevin''s
    notion of the bouma does not include counters... the best thing is to read & ask.
    The people who are really concerned with this theory stuff are not numerous -
    and ideas about the ways in which it might be applied to type design vary a great
    deal too. '
