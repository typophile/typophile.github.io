    has something like it with their <a href="http://www.p22.com/members/club.html">P22

    only about as big as the Underware library. They only have  about fix or six typefaces
    out, but they all have what I consider a lot in them, and I like all of them a
    lot. I'd pay a hundred bucks a year for that. Hope this helps a little.

    dropped $400 on fonts this semester\u2014and it\u2019s only a month in! It would
    have been even better during my sophomore and junior years when I had less money
    to spend and was just using whatever bootleg fonts were going around. I also think
    professors would be less likely to give fonts to students if the cost of a years
    worth of fonts was about equal to two good textbooks. \r\n\r\nThis would also
    be a great deal for the organization I work for. We don\u2019t have a huge budget
    so our display types don\u2019t change much because we can\u2019t justify dropping
    money on a font to use it once or twice. Paying a subscription fee would make
    a lot more sense, and allow me to avoid getting every font purchase approved.
    I would have very little trouble getting $100 per <em>month</em> approved if the
    collection were big enough.\r\n\r\nEdit: On a related note, I would be especially
    likely to use it if the whole thing operated using FEX."

    choose between this and current standard licensing. I'm assuming that you wouldn't
    be able to license an entire library for $100, so if I could choose maybe 2 full
    families in fully-featured OpenType and a handful of single-style fonts (probably
    display but not necessarily) this offer may be worth it. I'd much rather be able
    to pick a few things that I think would work for me than be saddled with whatever
    a default licensing package might be. Of course, I'm speaking as someone who is
    currently a hobbyist user of type, not a professional.\r\n\r\nThe biggest obstacle
    I see would be enforcing this licensing scheme. Have self-obsolescing fonts been
    developed? How would you retrieve the fonts after 1 year? Would this system be
    based on the honor system?"

    for free. Many more do not even offer discounts. On the other hand, an OpenType
    font often has far more in it than a normal PostScript Type 1 font may have. So
    a free upgrade there wouldn't really be fair in a lot of cases.\r\n\r\nThere will
    inevitably be a lot that changes in the next generation font format, and a lot
    that stays the same\u2026 just like every other technological step. But I personally
    don't expect the attitude toward the terms \"licensing\" and the idea of protecting
    intellectual property to change. In fact, if I were betting, I'd say that the
    next format will offer foundries even more protection somehow. "

    \r\n\r\nCurrently for several of our clients, we offer a licensing deal as follows:
    For a yearly fee they gain access to our entire library. As we come out with new
    fonts, they get access to those as well. When they use our fonts in their client's
    work, they bill price of the relevant fonts to their client. We offer them a discount
    on the font price that they can either pass along to their client, or take as
    a sales commission. \r\n\r\nWe also work with them to develop designs that they
    feel are useful.\r\n\r\nSo far it is working nicely.\r\n\r\nJames"
