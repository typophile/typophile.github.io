I saw this on myfonts, read the blurb at the bottom, and there's no reference to Chris Costello.

If you compare this Artichoke and Papyrus there are essentially the same face.

Derivative, but not identical. What I can't get, is why anyone would go through the trouble of creating something like that.

To make money, of course. Myfonts has many customers who are no professional designers. They can be fooled easily. And if you set the price low enoiugh, those fonts will sell. 

Here is an overlay (with the change in  weight removed):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-26_3520.jpg]

I really wish MyFonts would check all new releases for rip-offs.  There are enough experts out there, even among the MyFonts staff, who could spot these rip-offs easily. </div>

My wife liked it, so she started growing it in the small pond in front of the house. But it won't survive North Carolina winters outdoors, so we have to move it into the house during the winter months. It lives in water, so we have one of the few houses in a colder climate with year-long mosquitoes. Indoors. Also, when a stalk falls over, the cats like to chew on the leaves. Then they throw up.

Also, everyone on earth already has Papyrus due to bundling so no profits were siphoned away.

		<div class="commentbody">MyFonts is good on their word when something is brought to their attention. but beyond that I don't think there is much attention given to the checking the originality of designs. I suspect there are a lot of fonts on the site that are of questionable origins. 

I was looking at a font of Lettering Delights a while back on MyFonts and so I followed the links to the LD site. Turns out there were several recognizable fonts there including P22 Dearest, T26 Lassigue D'mato, and my own Shoebop (with Veer). When I emailed the company the web person removed them and the "CEO" emailed me saying he would comply with my request to remove them and look into the matter with their font guy. I don't know who was making fonts for them, but at $3 retail they definitely aren't labored over.

		<div class="commentbody">In answer to the original question, the roots are obvious. My hope is that it is an example of the sincerest form of flattery. It comes from a fresh trace and it is modified quite a bit as an exercise in making a font I couldn't use into one that I now use all the time. Yes, it has sold some (a few dozen copies), but it is certainly no threat to Papyrus. 

I'm releasing one next week that is a tracing of a printed page of Erasmus, one of Solo's old display fonts. It too is heavily modified (and it is only part of a new study on making a book font family I can actually use). I really like it and I am making it mine while tearing it apart to try and see why it is so attractive to me.

Here are some comments on  why I did Artichoke:

1. Seeing how Chris did it.

2. Make a font I could actually use

3. Yes, I did spend a ridiculous amount of time on it. Well over a hundred hours, as I recall.

4. Yes, I am pleased with the result. I use the font often and I can not use Papyrus much as is is because it is missing too many crucial things for me: my normal OpenType set with small caps, lining, oldstyle and small cap figures, and so on

I hope it is not too offensive to you all. It is not a nefarious plot. Myfonts only approved it after they saw my original tracings. It is certainly not an attempt to make money on Chris. It will probably end up in a new display font eventually. Remember, I'm just an old graphic designer hack who is very surprised that his font designs actually sell.

		<div class="commentbody"> Quite true, Lucia, I agree. The trouble is, we have no right to prevent production of type designs we dislike. We do have a right to prevent taking someone's intellectual property (good or bad) and using it for profit--however meager that profit. I certainly hope Mr Bergsland requested and received permission from the original designer and foundry before beginning his tracing and copying. Perhaps Mr Bergsland would be better served to create truly original designs. He might then see that a mere 100 hours is nothing when it comes to type design.

Or vintage fonts that have not yet been digitized. 

Reworking Papyrus certainly seems to me like an exercise in futility. I can't imagine why one would rework one of the world's most overused fonts in order to USE IT MORE. Yet, that's a personal choice, however strange. Profiting from it... seems a bit sleazy to me.

		<div class="commentbody">Above, Mr. Bergsland claims Artichoke "has sold <em>some</em> (a few dozen copies)" whereas on his website he advises us: "Be sure to check out the releases of the past two years. They include the <em>most popular fonts I've ever released</em>&mdash; Brinar & Artichoke," and elsewhere there, Artichoke is termed "another <em>strong seller</em>" (all emphases mine). 

A disconnect? Misleading, perhaps? Well, maybe not: If his "strong seller" has sold "a few dozen copies" only, perhaps the others are by comparison downright dormant. Deservedly so, if that's the case, for in casting a glance over his displayed wares one is hard pressed not to notice there's more than a mere whiff of familiarity to them all. "Derivative" alone won't cut it. 

So much the worse for us all &mdash; not to mention easily gulled consumers.

ChrisL has it spot on: "Mr Bergsland would be better served to create truly original designs."

This just sounds very similar, just this guy decided to see if he could sell his. But eh, it someone buys it, then they aren't worried about quality let alone design.

<em>In answer to the original question, the roots are obvious. My hope is that it is an example of the sincerest form of flattery.</em>

Your hope is vain in the extreme. You are not fooling anybody here. What you hope people will see as "imitation" is in fact plagiarism, a knock-off, a rip-off of somebody else's typeface design. Call it what it is.

<em>It comes from a fresh trace and it is modified quite a bit as an exercise in making a font I couldn’t use into one that I now use all the time.</em>

Whether you steal a digital font's outlines directly by importing the font file into Fontlab, or whether you auto-trace a print of the same font, makes no difference to me. I won't claim to speak for how others here see the two methods, but I see both methods as theft and theft only.

<em>Yes, it has sold some (a few dozen copies), but it is certainly no threat to Papyrus.</em>

A paper-thin justification. That it isn't shooting up the starlets or best sellers charts does not justify your plagiarism.

<em>I’m releasing one next week that is a tracing of a printed page of Erasmus, one of Solo’s old display fonts. It too is heavily modified (and it is only part of a new study on making a book font family I can actually use). I really like it and I am making it mine while tearing it apart to try and see why it is so attractive to me.</em>

Your methods of font production are, at a minimum, very questionable. Certainly it cannot be deemed "typeface design". IHacking other people's fonts and calling the resulting violation your own is plagiarism. Your methods of font production amount to the kind of ass-clownery that gives our industry a bad name. I am stopping short of making an ad hominem personal attack on you David, an argument against you as a person. Instead I ridicule your working methods and pour icy cold water on your plagiarized fonts and lack of ethics.

<em>I hope it is not too offensive to you all.</em>

I am disgusted by it. Please remove your Artichoke font from the market and destoy all copies and work files.

<em>It is not a nefarious plot. Myfonts only approved it after they saw my original tracings. It is certainly not an attempt to make money on Chris. It will probably end up in a new display font eventually. Remember, I’m just an old graphic designer hack who is very surprised that his font designs actually sell.</em>

(much laughter!) As if saying that is supposed to redeem you or somehow appease your peers. I'm not moved, not even by a fraction of an em. Remove Artichoke from your website and remove it from Myfonts before several other font makers and I start lobbying John Collins and Laurnece Penney to have it removed from Myfonts for you.

Oh yes, I'll do it too (lobby Myfonts). You can put money of that.

@Darrel: <em>I’m so glad to hear that MyFonts has at least one ’font guy’ on staff. ;0)</em>

I guess you're joking at least a little there. For the record, Myfonts employ several very well-informed and experienced font people. Laurence Penney and John Collins are just two of them.

I have trouble seeing a clear line between the two.

It seems that if one just uses the term 'revival' to begin with, they can save some time fighting those that claim it to be theft.

Granted, in this case, if there were no permissions granted, I'd have to side with this being a lazy remake of a known, current, protected typeface.

But many many fonts have been created from doing just the same...tracing a classic instance of type found in the wild on a sign, in lead, on wood (in fact, I've created fonts that way), etc.

Perhaps that's where the line is drawn...copying a typeface that has already been made into a digital font leans towards theft. Copying a typeface found on a box in an antique store leans towards 'revival'. </div>

But please be assured that we at MyFonts always review cases immediately whenever there is a complaint (no matter whether the complaint came from the party who claims that their rights have been infringed, or from someone else). Our policy is to remove the font from sales temporarily until the issue is resolved. 

However, when it comes to fresh digital versions of typeface designs that some people view as derivative (such as Adobe's Myriad, FontFont's City Street Type, Linotype's Basic Commercial, Monotype's Arial or quite a few faces from the Bitstream library), we employ industry standards, which, well, are not perfect. 

I should also stress that in any case, the original rights owner always has the options to follow the conflict resolution path widely accepted in civilized countries, i.e. a court of law.

That has some problems, as does the more popular "court of public opinion". It would be nice to have third court made up of industry leaders that could give disputed new designs an originality rating.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Guys… Chris Costello here,

Thanks for the emails. I suppose now is a good time to chime in.

This is not new. Check out my Rouge’s Gallery of Type Design Thieves:

Rip-off: Parchment “by Rick Mueller” 
http://www.fontspace.com/rick-mueller/parchment-mf
100% counterfeit free font…why?

Rip-off: Fidelma, “Designed by Patricia Lillie”: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lillie/fidelma/
A complete bastardization of Papyrus that retains only wisps of the original feel.

Rip-off: Ereshkigal “Designed by David Nalle” and sold by Scriptorium http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/ereshkigal/
See below for more of David’s original work…

Original design by Chris Costello: Blackstone: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chriscostello/blackstone/ 
During my “Jagged Edge Period 1983-88” :) 

Rip-off: Gaiseric, “Designed by David Nalle” and sold by Scriptorium http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/gaiseric/

Mr. David Bergsland has now earned himself a place of honor as the most recent member of this fellowship. 

With the love/hate thing that swirls around Papyrus set aside, the font is still, without question, a completely unique and original design… there is nothing else like it in the world, except for these poorly executed fakes. I used no references, “tracings” or other crutches to create it… Papyrus simply came forth from a flurry of hand-drawn sketches (I still have the original doodles). As a professional illustrator and graphic designer, I really consider myself an amateur font designer. I do not have many fonts available for sale and I am just learning FontLab. It just so happens that the few fonts I have designed turned out to be hot sellers and are thus widely imitated. With the exception of Letterpress Text (a respectful tribute to the classics), every font that I have created is entirely original. 

“Artichoke”? Please, David… I’m just not flattered anymore. This is an argument that has angered true type designers since the advent of the computer and the accessibility of font software to just about anybody. You obviously input Papyrus, moved a few points here, a few transformations there and output “Artichoke”. Papyrus, like any original font design, does not need to be improved… it is pretty much what the designer intended it to be and does not require the touch of an “old hack” “to make it more readable, and easier to use”. If you feel the need to customize it for your own use that’s fine, but repackaging it and selling it under a different name is cheap, opportunistic and wrong. 

But it’s not the money issue that bothers me. I sold the rights to market Papyrus to ITC a long time ago and my royalty payments are modest. You are siphoning more of their revenue than mine, and I have informed them of your actions. What bothers me and many others is that you find this practice of “tracing”, “deriving” or otherwise copying other peoples work then passing it of as your own to be perfectly fine. Is this what you teach to your students? Do you address this subject in your books? 

“Artichoke started with adding a roughened, light edge to the character widths of my popular humanist sans font families.”

Were you implying that you added the rough edges or are you giving me credit for the rough edges I created on the original?

“I was trying to create the light, airy feel of hand-scribed letters on a rough natural surface.”

Really? I’m sorry if I did I not do a good enough job creating the light, airy feel the first time around.

"I did spend a ridiculous amount of time on it. Well over a hundred hours, as I recall."

Why in the world would anyone spend this much time being redundant? Could the answer be found in the following quote:

“David started to design fonts for sale rather than for self entertainment.”

Somebody also mentioned earlier that 100 hours is nothing for a true type designer. Very true! I spent months handcrafting the original, and have spent countless hours digitizing my other hand-drawn fonts. You have done nothing here worthy of respect. There is not much I can do legally to stop you from what you are doing, but ethically speaking, you need to stop selling “Artichoke” and simply keep it for your own use. 

I confronted the “designer” of “Fidelma” and she swore up and down it was not a rip-off. You cannot argue with someone who does not hold on to reason. I respectfully asked David Nalle to stop selling “Ereshkigal” and “Gaiseric” but got no reply. Sadly, this issue of stealing intellectual property speaks volumes about the “Something-for-Nothing” culture that has been cultivated by the Baby Boomers over the past three decades. As I segue into social commentary mode, check out this quote from a charged and very revealing article below:

“This generation lacks self control, morals, a work ethic, and savings ethic. Based on the recent actions of our government and corporate leaders, we seem to lack any ethics at all.”

http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=16602

I’ll leave it at that. This is a font forum. My rants on pop culture, U.S. foreign policy, the economy and politics can be found elsewhere. 

If you are going to call yourself a designer, then design… don’t simply imitate, then profit from the hard work of others.

While I readily admit that I am not fond of your typeface I also fervently state that it is truly yours and should not be open to thieves and pirates to pretend is theirs. I hope that Bergsland willingly removes his atrocious pirated version from sale or distribution. 
You are right, too many people think that because something is easy to steal that they somehow are granted license to do so.

While Papyrus may be over used. It is still original. If someone wanted to make a new spin off it why not consult the original designer? But no, Bergsland strident attitude did not make room for the high road.

Yes, ethic and morals have gone down the tubes. Unfortunately its not limited to the indies either- its even prevalent at the corporate level. 

Fake:
http://www.linotype.com/304434/ginkgo-family.html

Real:
http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&id2=roman

People that work with type and appreciate the real thing will never go for these fakes. Its really so sad for the forgers because their reputations get tarnish and then they have not a whole lot left over in the end. Sad for them.

		<div class="commentbody">That's a solid step in the right direction. Let's hope MyFonts also takes into consideration Chris Costello's remarks on the other rip-offs of his work that are presently being sold through MyFonts. I think his comments should be construed as a clear complaint. 

If not, why not consider this posting of mine a complaint? After all, Adam, you said it: "we at MyFonts always review cases immediately whenever there is a complaint (no matter whether the complaint came from the party who claims that their rights have been infringed, or from someone else)."

In my view, action on such obvious cases can only work to further enhance the standing of MyFonts among the broader community of designers / vendors.

Let's all hope for a quick, equitable resolution of this particular situation.

I hope this will be a continuing policy, and that it will mark some new professional standards on this issue of copying. Not law, but professional standards. 

I do think that the cases you mentioned are arguably either quite different from this case, or are now moot.  

First of all, with the consolidation of Monotype and Linotype, many of the most egregious copying cases, such as Arial and Helvetica, are now moot, as they have common ownership.  

As to Bitstream, those faces were a product of the anarchy of the initial period of change to a new technology. As I understand it, the leader of the type division of Linotype was fired, and not allowed to digitize those faces, some of which he had directed development of. He and others founded Bitstream, the first digital typefoundry, and digitized what had been hot metal faces, most of them classics by long dead designers. Then Linotype did their own versions. And Bitstream is now giving proper credit, as I understand it. 

I really don't think Myriad vs Frutiger is in the same class as these. Myriad is heavily indebted to Frutiger, but it is a systematically thought out new design, with new terminals and curves, a softer aesthetic, and new italics and condensed versions. 

In any case, these issues were "litigated" in the court of public opinion before MyFonts came into existence, so it is understandable that MyFonts wouldn't take up these issues. And, of course, they are part of Bitstream.  

The kind of copying and clumsy manipulation that this case represents really shouldn't get over the bar at MyFonts. I hope your decision here sets a policy that even if legal such clearly unethical practices won't be allowed to run rampant at what I suppose is the leading reseller of fonts. </div>

* stop hammering David now, this one is over
* give David a second chance, so to speak
* stop calling him "Mr. Bergsland" because it's a trite form of put-down. He has a name you know: David.

David, if you're still reading please rest assured I bear no on-going animosity towards you. You've done the right thing by us your peers, and I thank you for cooperating and listening to reason.

Bert, and typophilers in general&#8212;"Tiff" likes to be called "Tiffany", thank you.

		<div class="commentbody">Minor obiter: <em>stop calling him “Mr. Bergsland” because it’s a trite form of put-down.</em> It was never intended as as such on my part. Instead, it's merely a matter of being polite. To be clear, consider the evenhandedness: in private correspondence I have addressed Mr. Costello as "Mr. Costello," not as "Chris," even though I doubt he'd mind the informality.

Some folks regard the overly-casual use of first names as a status leveler, while others do not view it so. Similarly, "Mr." as an honorific oughn't be read mal fide as snide. 

Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, after all, though other times they're loaded. ;)

Well, I’m glad I posted this thread. We all need correction sometimes in our life. I’m pretty sure <em>David</em> has learned his lesson (albeit in a public forum). Copying someone else’s work can only lead to embarrassment, even dishonor. 

I look forward to original productions of his. David can only get better as a designer from this point.

Like James said, this is over.

I thank everyone for their participation and keeping their comments above-board.

Don't jinx the thread! When people say that things tend to spin up to the low 200's.</div>
