  button? Not the .com part, but the rest of the letters. It seems like it must be
  something really simple and commonly used, but I can't figure it out. \r\n\r\nThank
  you so much in advance!"

  body: "You've got two fonts there in the first sample \"font.jpg\". \"Exotic Pet\"
    corresponds in parts to Helvetica condensed black and Folio condensed bold, but
    matches neither of them. The sides of \"o\" and \"e\" in your sample are curved,
    and I'm having trubble finding a matching font. I've run out of time. \r\n\r\nTake
    a look at some alternate gothics, or look at condensed sans serifs in bold or
    black weights.\r\n\r\n\"EXPO\" is a different font. No idea sorry, not enuff time
    to search.\r\n\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    in Photoshop. \r\n\r\nAnd I'm fairly certain that Exotic Pet is Helvetica condensed
    black with a pretty large kerning.\r\n"

  body: I don't know how I thought those two were the same font. I think I've just
    been staring at fonts way too long today trying to figure it out. Thank you very
    much for all your help! You guys/girls are the best!
