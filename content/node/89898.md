  but I am worried they will violate the copyright of the charts.\r\n\r\nMy questions
  are:\r\n<ol>How different would they have to be from the posted PDF charts? In other
  words, can I use a grid?</ol>\r\n<ol>Can I mention the word \"Unicode\"?</ol>\r\n<ol>Assuming
  I own the typeface, is it a violation of the EULA to list all characters in a given
  block?</ol>\r\n\r\nThank you for any input you can give me.\r\n\r\n-Neil\r\n\r\n*I
  realize that it is rather foolish to mention this idea to a group of professional
  designers, but I trust you."

    idea of Unicode, which you're probably not doing anyway.\r\nBTW if you make one
    for Armenian I'll be your first customer!\r\n\r\nDo note however that -fortunately
    for everybody- I'm not a lawyer.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    attach a mockup graphic so they have a clear idea what you're intending. \r\n\r\nThe
    EULA question is probably more complicated and would depend on the foundry. Again,
    I'd check with them to be on the safe side."

    for them to be free. If, subsequently, someone takes my freeware and sells it,
    I am not pleased.\r\n\r\nOf course, this analogy only works if the OP poster is
    planning on selling the shirts; if he's going to give them away, I don't see a
    problem\u2026"
