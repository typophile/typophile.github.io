  least a close modern alternative)...\r\nThe scans come from two different books,
  both published between 1850-1880 in London.\r\nThe first is a far better scan, but
  the second has better contrast.\r\n\r\nThank you for any help you can provide,\r\nPeter"

  body: I believe the closest digital versions of that would be either <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/">Scotch
    Modern</a> by the ever intelligent Nick Shinn or Monotype's <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/monotype-scotch-roman/">Scotch
    Roman</a>. Most of the characters look closer to Scotch Modern where as the Scotch
    Roman has a similar 2.
