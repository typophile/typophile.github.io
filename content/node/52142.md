  body: "The closest resemblance I could find was [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/titan-ot/|Titan
    Bold]] by Dino dos Santos. If you square the corners a bit and close the 'c' it's
    pretty close. For that matter, you could re-draw those straight letters. I could
    not find an exact match, but the 'techno' look is everywhere at free sites like
    Dafont, and I didn't try looking there.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
