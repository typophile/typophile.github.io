  am extremely curious about the typeface used for the heading and credits of this
  poster. It is characterized by a uppercase A with a bseemingly broken crossbar;
  crossed uppercase W; double-story lowercase G where the the bowl is significantly
  larger and almost oval in shape, quite tight from the looks of it; an uppercase
  K and lowercase E where the \"terminals\" (?) are brushed. This is largest that
  I could find of the poster and I am aware that the text is rather small but any
  help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nN"
