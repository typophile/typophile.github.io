  the 3rd. I'm a student, light traveler, and Couchsurfing friendly. My budget's not
  high, so couchsurfing is preferred, but I might be able to split a hotel room for
  a few days if necessary.\r\n\r\nHere's my couchsurfing profile, if you'd  more info
  about me: https://www.couchsurfing.org/profile.html?id=YJQ60P5"

  body: "My arrangement is mildly convoluted, but see if you might fit in:\r\nI've
    reserved a room at the Hyatt for the night of the 31st, followed by three nights
    at the Liaison which is <em>right</em> across the street. Long story why it ended
    up that way. Anyway if you chip in $75 per night for whichever of those four nights
    you'd like, I'm game. It's not cheap like couchsurfing, but the comfort and convenience
    of being <em>right there</em> is hard to overstate.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
