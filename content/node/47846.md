  with rounded serifs? We're looking for something like this for a charity project,
  like Rockwell, but would want to have it a bit softer, and if the serifs had round
  endings, that would do it. We've tried it by rounding the corners on a few characters,
  but are wondering what's the closest existing font would be.\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\nEdit:
  Ah yes, and it shouldn't be any typewriter font.\r\n"

    rounded but it is a very nice slab serif face with a soft/friendly feeling...
