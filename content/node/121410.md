  body: "The small scale of your image does not show how the letters are formed. This
    is clear in the following Pan American World Airways wall sign from the late 1950s
    and early 1960s:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PanAmericanWorldAirwaysWallSignLate1950sEarly1960s_4463.jpg]\r\nNote
    the very geometric triangular [Latin} serifs: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/PanAmericanWorldAirways1950sEarly1960sSM_4888.jpg]\r\nThe
    PanAm font is very inaccurate.\r\nTo recreate the lettering you would do better
    to start with a sans serif font which matches the letterforms and width.\r\nDon"

    As Kevin and Don''s said, custom (and not a good one). I''d probably start with
    a contrasted wide sans like the ones suggested by Kevin simply adding those (ugly)
    latin/triangular serifs. Some more candidates for customization: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/brenham|Brenham]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/condor|Condor]] (less fat/vintage/wooden
    type but more work on /R leg and /C shape)'

  body: "Can't find anything closer than Gothic Extended or Brenham, which look almost
    identical.\r\nThe vector PANAM runs the letters together. Good find, but I would
    rely on the dimensions in the raster image I posted, particularly for the serifs.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "The secret behind the triangular Latin serifs.\r\nThe designer was at a loss
    how to update the old italic speed style logo.\r\nAs each idea failed he folded
    the sheet into a simple paper airplane, threw it across the room and had another
    shot of his favorite tipple. When he awoke he forced his eyes open and saw all
    these little white triangles scattered around.\r\nBig idea! Paste triangular serifs
    on an old style thick and thin font and his job was done! He hoped it would fly
    with his boss just as well as his folded paper airplanes had done. An so it did.
    The little white triangles flew until PANAM went bankrupt in the 1990s.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks Don, for sharing such entertaining secret! :)\r\nIf one is more a
    cut person than a paste one, a reasonable approximation could be achieved pruning
    excess serifs from Latin Wide (the main problem being Latin Wide is a bit less
    contrasted than the Pan Am logo)."

  body: "Can't agree more Don. \"Type is weak and not really inspiring. It lacks feeling
    of 'speed', 'velocity', 'quickness', 'air', 'power', 'man' and 'conquest'. Why
    not making it Italic and add some light rays to each letters? And please, don't
