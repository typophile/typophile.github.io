    even allow the [eventual] kerning to affect the letterforms! Even hinting can
    have such a &#34;backwards&#34; effect - just look at the Bolds in the MS core
    fonts - they wouldn&#39;t have been so bold without the necessity to eventually
    not have to hint every single stem, etc. <BR> <BR>Practically speaking, the greatest
    amount of iteration will be between the letterforms and the sidebearings: because
    the <i>relationship between the Black and the White</i> is what matters most,
    the &#34;internal&#34; counters of glyphs are tied to the &#34;external&#34; sidebearings.
    So you make some key glyphs &#40;different for each designer, but also dependent
    on the intended use of the font - for example a display face will rely more on
    the memorability of individual glyphs, while a text face will rely more on the
    integration of the whole&#41;, then see how they fit together, modify them, add
    some more glyphs, try those in combo, modify, etc. Yeah, it&#39;s a pain.  :-&#41;

  body: I agree with Hrant that it&#39;s very iterative. <BR> <BR>That being said,
    the most important thing is to try to finalize the spacing before getting into
    kerning. If you mess with the spacing much after you get into kerning, you will
    likely need to throw out all your kerning and start over again. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re
    working in PostScript style outlines, there&#39;s no reason not to hint your glyphs
    as you&#39;re working on them. If you&#39;re working with TrueType outlines, you
    pretty much have to leave hinting to absolute dead last. <BR> <BR>Other than that,
    it&#39;s a matter of taste and preference. <BR> <BR>Personally, working with PS
    outlines, I complete a handful of glyphs, and while I&#39;m working on them I
    space and hint them. I then test them together and fix the spacing some more.
    Then I continue to expand the glyph complement &#40;hinting all the while&#41;,
    periodically stopping and refining the spacing. <BR> <BR>The typeface I&#39;m
    working on right now I have tweaked the spacing too much, so I will be tossing
    out the moderate amount of kerning I already did and starting over. I didn&#39;t
    invest a lot of time in the kerning because I knew I wasn&#39;t 100% done with
    the spacing. <BR> <BR>Hope that&#39;s of some help. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    understand this statement, Hrant; can you explain what you mean by prohibitive?
    I do agree, if this is what you are getting at, that some scripts require extensive
    kerning to achieve acceptable basic spacing, i.e. that kerning is not always &#39;exceptions&#39;
    to basic spacing as it usually is in Latin fonts. In that case, application of
    kerning should be part of the language shaping engine, not something turned on
    by the user.

  body: 'It comes down to the near-requirement of avoiding touching: you want the
    words to set tightly, but scripts that have letters with a lot of lateral &#34;protrusions&#34;
    will collide a lot &#40;with kerning off&#41;. You can either set everything loose
    and use a ton of negative pairs to correct, or you can set everything with &#34;natural&#34;
    tightness and use some positive pairs to remove collisions. Which way you go depends
    on a number of things, like the degree of collision in the script, the intended
    user base of the font, but also the amount of time/effort you want/can_afford_to
    put into the design.  And this last consideration isn&#39;t limited to lazy/cheap
    people like me. :-&#41; The MS core fonts have too-dark Bolds basically because
    it would have been ridiculous&#42; to hint every single stem to snap wider to
    two pixels. <BR> <BR>&#42; Both in effort and resultant file size - note that
    about 50% of the file of an MS core font is the hinting!! <BR> <BR>Let me give
    a real example: Armenian has a fair amount of &#34;collision potential&#34; &#40;mostly
    in the descenders&#41;. You can tame the protrusions, but that&#39;s culturally
    and functionally &#40;think boumas&#41; bad - although you still do it a little
    bit &#40;in the same way that a &#34;g&#34; in a [good] Latin text face needs
    to look slightly cramped&#41;. To save myself having to set everything loose and
    then tighten with a ton of pairs, I went the other way. With 546 pairs&#42; I
    got really good texture. My estimate of how many pairs would have been required
    with the other &#40;non-kern-reliant&#41; method is 3-4000, so a lot more work.
    With kerning off, this kern-reliant method will produce some collisions when set
    without kerning, but: it will also produce better &#34;x-band&#34; spacing; people
    with kerning off aren&#39;t likely to mind some touching anyway. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    Tellingly &#40;although not surprisingly&#41; about half of the pairs were positive
    - very unlike the typical Latin font. BTW, Mana uses some reliance on positive
    pairs too - this allows it to be tight &#40;unlike Verdana for example&#41;. Over
    1/3-rd of Mana&#39;s pairs are positive. <BR> <BR>&#62; application of kerning
    should be part of the language <BR>&#62; shaping engine, not something turned
    on by the user. <BR> <BR>But in practice the user -and the app- end up sharing
    the responsability. Most notably, MS Word does support kerning, but the user has
    to turn it on &#40;and every time&#41; - never gonna happen.  :-&#40; <BR> <BR>hhp

    <BR>That is simply untrue. You&#39;re presenting incorrect speculation as fact
    &#40;again&#41;. Given a well-hinted TrueType font in the first place, it is literally
    a single line of code that accomplishes this. <BR> <BR>In any superhinted TT font,
    one is controlling when the stems change from one thickness to the next, at least
    for most of the lower levels &#40;one, two, three pixels thick&#41;. This is especially
    necessary when there&#39;s a matching italic, since one needs to make sure they
    break at the same ppem sizes for those lower levels. <BR> <BR>In other words,
    the &#34;additonal&#34; work involved and font size added, rounded to the nearest
    whole number as a percentage, is zero. &#40;Though of course if one had already
    done the detailed hinting and then changed the stem widths, that would entail
    more work. But like spacing vs. kerning, that&#39;s not the order one does these
    tasks in.&#41; <BR> <BR>If I were to speculate, I&#39;d &#42;guess&#42; that the
    reason the bolds are so heavy for those fonts is to keep them more WYSIWYG between
    what they look like at typical screen sizes and what they look like in print.
    But that would be just speculation, though with a little more basis. <BR> <BR>This
    is somehow comforting. I think I had agreed with the last half dozen posts of
    Hrant&#39;s that I had read. I was wondering if it was a sign of the apocalypse
    or something.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>That aside, I do understand and agree with Hrant&#39;s comments
    about different scripts needing a different spacing vs. kerning strategy. I believe
    my original comments apply reasonably well to Latin, Greek and Cyrillic. <BR>

  body: I&#39;ve done some &#34;superhinting&#34;, but not tons - so maybe I don&#39;t
    realize how easy it is to pop all the stems wider. On the other hand, your explanation
    for the exteme weight of the MS core Bolds doesn&#39;t seem very probable to me.
    There&#39;s so little WYSIWYG between <i>different sizes of the Geogia bitmaps</i>
    &#40;which is actually good news though&#41;, much less between the bitmaps and
    print - so WYSIWYG of <i>the color relationship between screen and print</i> seems
    pretty far-fetched. Not least because it would have to be based on a specific

  body: That has more to do with issues around shapes where changing the shape requires
    delta hints, which do add &#40;substantially&#41; to file size. A global stem
    width adjustment does not affect file size significantly, given that individual
    stems already have their own CVTs, and on top of that they have inheritance set
    up so that all the vertical stems can be controlled at one go. <BR> <BR>Another
    way of realizing that this is not such a big deal is to remember that plenty of
    superhinted fonts that do not have such a strong weight difference in the outlines
    &#40;between regular and bold&#41; have been superhinted so that the bold is consistently
    heavier than the regular even at low ppem sizes. Times New Roman, Arial, Palatino
    Linotype, and a bunch of others.... <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    that wrapped to those bitmaps without very much hinting. That approach likely
    explains why the bolds are so bold, regardless of whether they actually needed

    when PPMs switch to 2, 3, 4 etc. pixels for both horizontal and vertical stems,
