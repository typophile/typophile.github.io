  1910?\r\n\r\nsorry about the image resolution and the fact that it's only one letter.
  (Clearly not the same as some of the more angular 'blocky' college fonts- looks
  to me as if the serifs are curved not block type, but could just be my eyes!)\r\n\r\nsuggestions
  and thought please folks. Many thanks"

    this could be a tall order, so a font that has a similar ''P'' would do okay! '

  body: "I've tried to focus my search on slab serifs with curved transition ([[http://www.myfonts.com/search/egyptienne/|Egyptienne]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/clarendon/fonts/|Clarendon]])
    with a varsity/college feeling. Here are some, matching only /P specifications,
    hoping there'd be at least one that could meet your expectations: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/egyptienne-2/|Egyptienne]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/clarendon/|Clarendon]] (MT version [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/clarendon/|here]]),
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/xenia/|Xenia]] (the only one with straight-legged
    /R, more \"varsity\" to me), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/gold-fever/|Gold
    Fever]] ([[http://www.myfonts.com/search/bookman|Bookman]] track I've decided
    not to follow because too far from varsity style to me)\r\nThe other option would
    be to start with any geometric slab serif of your choice and rework transitions
    for each letters you need. Here is what I've done starting from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/rockwell|Rockwell]],
    reworking serif transition and recreating /O and /C (may be /R leg would have
    need some tweaking).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/princeton_4921.png]"

  body: "Dear Ryuk\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your input! The font suggestions (particularly
    Xenia) are definitely the sort of thing I was looking for!\r\nThanks too for taking
    the time to play around with Rockwell and create the text image you posted...more
    food for thought.\r\n\r\nAgain, many thanks and best wishes\r\n\r\nSteve"
