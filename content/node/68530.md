  Greek, obviously. My question is, does the dot drop down with characters that have
  a descender, such as gamma, eta, rho, etc., or should it stay at a common depth
  & just be offset to clear the descender? (The latter is a bit tough with gamma,
  but I suppose could be arranged.)\r\n\r\nTIA"

  body: "I try to avoid mixing Leiden system and lowercase when possible, but you
    probably don't have that choice here. I've just pulled a few books off my shelves
    that quote a lot of epigraphic or papyrological material in lowercase, and there
    appear to be three solutions. The first is to let them crash (although the book
    that did this also failed to align them with each other in spite of this, so I
    can't recommend it as a model). The second is to nudge them sideways - I saw this
    done with a gamma (Porson), but I didn't see an example of a dotted zeta or xi,
    where it would be more difficult, in that one. The third is to have all the dots
    much lower than the usual dotbelow is (as in Semitic or Indic transliteration)
    - I found this in a book published by the American Society of Papyrologists, who
    probably have to deal with this problem more than most. I didn't find an example
    of dropping them on the characters with descenders, but I don't have many papyrological
    books.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problems will be zeta, xi, iota subscripts, and maybe
    chi. My first inclination would be to go with very low dots, but that's probably
    not the easiest solution unless you're using a Greek face that has a some extra
    space under the descenders, and enough leading that it'll be clear which line
    they belong to."

  body: "I can't recall off hand whether I made the dot height contextual or not.\r\n\r\nThe
    connecting overline character used in Greek abbreviations is contextual in SBL
    Greek, so that if there is even one tall letter in a word the line is raised over
    all the letters. Obviously something similar could be done with the dot below,
    but I can't remember whether I implemented this in the current build of the font,
    or was waiting for feedback.\r\n\r\n[Sorry, I'm very tired now, so can't bring
    myself to go and check. Feel free to <a href=\"http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/biblicalfonts.aspx\">download
    the font</a> and test for yourself. Feedback much appreciated, here or in the

  body: "Michael, What you show is basically what I've done. I felt uncomfortable
    dropping the dot lower on the gamma than, say, eta or mu, but it seems that's
    OK. It is not a convention I'm very familiar with.\r\n\r\nCharles"

  body: "The example above is relevant provided the underdot you are dealing with
    is the one used to denote unsure reading. It is a mark that  has nothing to do
    with the language and I then see no reason for it to look attached to the letter,
    like a diacritic.  Here is a relevant  comment from http://www.roman-emperors.org/debbiean.htm
    showing that the question is a bit tricky:\r\n<cite>\r\nAnother problem surfaced
    in a recent issue: How to handle marking the underdot for unsure reading, a common
    sign in epigraphy and papyrology. [...] Originally we had used the Unicode \"combining
    underdot\" for the unsure reading. However, the Unicode Technical Committee members
    have pointed out that it would be better to handle it differently, since the underdot
    has a specific phonetic meaning in many languages (e.g., a vocalic r in Sanskrit),
    but here indicates something different.\r\n</cite>\r\nKeeping that mark low enough
    might resolve the ambiguity (it could even be found under an underdot!)\r\n\r\nMichel"

    depending on leading, it could be then confused with a \"dot above\"! ;-)"
