    try the burnt caramel. Many other standard & exotic flavors too. Kulfee is a big

    St ( no URL that I could find quickly  but here is a review)\r\nhttp://www.bostonphoenix.com/supplements/the_best/01/fe6.html
    \r\nKnown for surprising & fun flavors. Located at Inmann Square, Cambridge.\r\n\r\nAlso
    famous:\r\n\r\nHerrell's Ice Cream\r\n15 Dunster St Cambridge MA\r\n\r\nEmack

    also seems to be a little bug for some users of PC Firefox. The old Flash splash

  body: "Just signed up. Firefox on PC worked for me. \r\n\r\nIf you are wavering
    on whether to stay Sunday evening to see the <a href=\"http://www.museumofprinting.org/\"><strong>Museum
    of Printing</strong></a>, I highly recommend it. I had the pleasure of visiting
    it in April. It has two collections that are fascinating if you are interested
    in type. \r\n\r\nFirst, it has nearly all the kinds of presses and typesetting
    machines from 1850 to 1980--the era starting when power-driven presses started
    and ending with the eclipse of 'relief' printing and the takeover of offset printing.
    \r\n\r\nWhat I had no idea of is that the 'revolutions' in printing technology
    over the past 40 years in fact go back another hundred. There is significant turn
    over in the technology almost every twenty years for the full time. And Gardner
    LePoer, the director of the museum tells a fascinating story of what drove this
    change. How power printing drove the search for machine composition, and how offset
    printing drove new changes in composition and in type production. And you can
    see it all before your eyes. \r\n\r\nThe unique treasure of the Printing Museum
    is the complete collection of Merganthaler Linotype drawings, over a quarter million
    production drawings, including Dwiggins' typefaces. Larry Oppenberg, who worked
    for Linotype in the photo type days, and knows the collection well, showed me
    some of the treasures. \r\n\r\nIt was thrilling to see these drawings, on which
    so much care has been lavished, and which have been reproduced in type millions
    of times all over the world. \r\n\r\nOn important thing also became clear. Although
    English Monotype, especially under Stanley Morrison, did the most talking about
    type, Linotype actually did most of the composition and printing--perhaps 70%
    until the advent of photo type. Also they had an amazing tradition of solid craftsmanship,
    evident in the drawings. Further, leading designers such as Matthew Carter, David
    Berlow and many others had worked in the Merganthaler Linotype drawing office,
    so its tradition lives on in their work, and those they influence.        \r\n\r\nAnyway
    it promises to be a rewarding visit!"

    to Boston for the typofestivities this year (woo hoo!). Hearing this, my friend
    who lived in Boston for a while sent me the following 'Selected Highlights of
    the Area' list. I hope it's helpful:\r\n\r\n------\r\nFor lunch, you must go to
    Chacarero. It's right in Downtown\r\nCrossing. It's very close to TypeCon: <a
    href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=26+Province+St.,+boston,+ma&daddr=One+Avenue+de+Lafayette+Boston,+MA+02111&ie=UTF8&om=1\">LINK</a>\r\n\r\nI
    would bet a LARGE sum of money that you will love it.\r\n\r\nFor dinner, you'll
    be near Chinatown. Check out Suishaya if\r\nyou like sushi. Actually, check it
    out even if you don't;\r\nthey've got good Korean food.\r\n\r\nThere's a tiny
    hole in wall, with space for perhaps 15\r\npeople, at 74 Kneeland St in Chinatown;
    it also is very\r\nclose to where you'll be: <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=74+Kneeland+St,+Boston,+Massachusetts&daddr=1+avenue+de+lafayette,+boston,ma&ie=UTF8&om=1\">LINK</a>\r\n\r\nOrder
    the scallion pancakes; they're a lot like so:\r\nhttp://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/252.html\r\n\r\nAlso
    order the Shanghai noodles. Pancake + noodles will cost\r\nyou something like
    $6.\r\n\r\nThere is a dearth of good coffee around there, though you\r\nshould
    take a bit of a walk to here: <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=1+avenue+de+lafayette,+boston,ma&daddr=338+Newbury+Street,+boston,+ma&ie=UTF8&om=1\">LINK</a>\r\n\r\nThey
    make a damned good cappuccino, and they're probably the\r\nbest bookstore in Boston.
    Not the best bookstore in greater\r\nBoston, mind you; to me, that honor belongs
    to the Harvard\r\nBook Store in Harvard Square, which is a 15-minute T ride\r\nfrom
    the Park Street T stop, which is the one nearest to\r\nTypeCon: <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=1+avenue+de+lafayette,+boston,ma&daddr=128+Tremont+St,+Boston,+MA+02108&ie=UTF8&lr=lang_en%7Clang_fr&om=1\">LINK</a>\r\n\r\nThe
    best pizza in Boston is probably The Upper Crust:\r\nhttp://www.theuppercrustpizzeria.com/\r\n\r\nFor
    great and cheap burritos, try Anna's Taqueria. They were\r\na staple for me when
    I was poor, and I would still chow down\r\non them now if I lived there when *not*
    poor.\r\n\r\nMy favorite Irish pub in Boston is the Kinsale, in Government\r\nCenter:
    <a href=\"http://www.google.com/maps?daddr=2+Center+Plz,+Boston,+MA+02108+(Kinsale+Irish+Pub+%26+Restaurant)+%4042.359678,-71.061371&saddr=1+avenue+de+lafayette,+boston,ma&f=li&hl=en&dq=kinsale+loc:+Boston,+MA&cid=42358333,-71060278,507591623402495600&ie=UTF8&om=1\">LINK</a>\r\n\r\nThey
    pour a damned fine Guinness.\r\n\r\nIf you go farther afield, you could check
    out The People's\r\nRepublik in Central Square in Cambridge (so called because\r\nCambridge
    is known as \"The People's Republic of Cambridge),\r\nor The Field just up the
    street. Central Square is on the\r\nred line, one stop south of Harvard Square,
    so it's maybe a\r\n10-minute T ride from the Park Street T.\r\n\r\nNow that I
    have money to buy expensive cheese, wine, bread,\r\nolives and so forth, I wish
    I lived near Formaggio: <a href=\"http://www.google.com/maps?daddr=268+Shawmut+Ave,+Boston,+MA+02118+(South+End+Formaggio)+%4042.342972,-71.068997&saddr=1+avenue+de+lafayette,+boston,ma&f=li&hl=en&dq=formaggio+loc:+Boston,+MA&cid=42358333,-71060278,18341510463997526295&ie=UTF8&om=1\">LINK</a>\r\n\r\nI've
    not actually been to that Formaggio; I've only been to\r\nthe one near Harvard
    Square, which is actually quite a hike\r\neven from the T. But I assume the South
    End one (that I just\r\nlinked to) is equally great.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Public
    Library is a work of art on its own, and\r\nI'm pretty sure it has a bunch of
    Sargent paintings.\r\nArchitecturally it's breathtaking.\r\n<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=1+avenue+de+lafayette,+boston,ma&daddr=700+Boylston+St.,+Boston+MA+02116&ie=UTF8&om=1\">LINK</a>\r\n\r\nThe
    Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is filled with Sargent\r\npaintings:\r\nhttp://www.gardnermuseum.org/\r\n\r\nIt's
    on the green line, which your T stop serves. To get T\r\ndirections, go to http://trip.mbta.com/cgi-bin/itin_page_dhtml.pl\r\n\r\nand
    get directions from 1 Avenue de Lafayette in Boston to\r\n280 Fenway in Boston.
    It's a 15-minute ride, with 5 or so\r\nminutes of walking on either end.\r\n\r\nThe
    whole neighborhood of Coolidge Corner -- on the green\r\nline -- is cool and fun.
    They have a great indie movie\r\ntheatre, restored to its 1920's grandeur:\r\nhttp://www.coolidge.org/\r\n\r\nBoston
    is a film town. Boston is also an ice-cream town, and\r\nyou can't leave there
    without going to Toscanini's:\r\nhttp://www.tosci.com/\r\n\r\nApparently the New
    York Times said they have the \"best ice\r\ncream in the world.\" I can't testify
    to that, though I can\r\ntell you that it's the best ice cream I've ever had.
    And\r\nmind-bendingly great milkshakes. I might recommend a\r\nBelgian-chocolate
    milkshake with a shot of espresso in it.\r\n\r\nThat should do for now.\r\n------\r\n\r\nI'm
    a big <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Singer_Sargent\">John Singer
    Sargent</a> fan, hence the Sargent stuff. I'm sure he'd be happy to give more
    recommendations, so feel free to send me an IM and I'll pass it along."
