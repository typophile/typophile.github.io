  Is there some resource for getting some sort of essential typeface starter pack?
  I'm looking for solid typefaces for multiple occasions, something that might act
  as a base for my type library. Of course, I'm on a limited budget, but I'm realizing
  that the free font sites out there don't offer the sort of \"nuts and bolts\" essential
  typefaces I need. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts? How can I get my type library essentials
  without breaking my [tiny] bank?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I think Adobe CS comes with a few fonts, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nSome people
    recommend establishing about ten good workhorse fonts for everyday use. You could
    start by picking two or three from each category, choosing a \"formal\" and \"informal\"
    typeface from each of these categories: sans-serif, serif, display, script.\r\n\r\nYou
    most certainly will want robust type families, so look for families with lots
    of weights. It'll cost more up front, but you'll be glad you did.\r\n\r\nOr you
    can try these sites to get started:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/collections.htm

    of those just a fraction. That's a great link to adobe's collections, thanks!
    Their \"opentype basics\" seems like a good starting place with a breadth of choice.
    \r\n\r\nIs there a better option out there? Maybe somebody knows of a similar
    sort of font pack in the same price range ($100-$200)? \r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: For that amount you would be better served licensing a really good family
    of typefaces. In addition you could license something more along the lines of
    a display family and allow the Adobe fonts to work in conjunction.

  body: "I'll second the recommendation for Adobe Type Basics, OpenType Edition. There's
    a lot of overlap with the fonts that came with CS2, but you still get a few additional
    complete families. For instance, Basics includes the Palatino Std 1 package, but
    Basics is the same price as Palatino Std 1: $99. Go figure. With Basics you get
    more families and also a smattering of display and novelty fonts.\r\n\r\nAnother
    somewhat cheesy route to take is to find a used copy of Corel Draw or the Corel
    graphics suite. Corel bundles, or at least used to bundle, some version of the
    complete Bitstream font catalog. This contains about 1,200 fonts, including many
    digitized versions of classic text fonts such as Plantin, Bembo, Sabon, Granjon,
    a couple Garamonds, Univers, Electra, Caledonia, Melior, Frutiger, Cheltenham,
    a few Bookmans, a few Bodonis, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Bitstream catalog is a much better
    collection than the \"1,000 font for $5\" CDs which are just freeware fonts pressed
    onto a CD. However, compared to top-notch Adobe fonts, these old Bitstream fonts
    aren't quite as nice since they often do not include small caps or old-style figures.
    I think the bundle included both Type1 and TrueType versions of each font. You
    can still use these fonts on a Mac if you have a font manager. (I use FontAgent
    Pro.) I don't know about Windows.\r\n\r\nOr you can buy the current CorelDRAW
    Graphics Suite X3 which apparently has an upgraded type catalog -- it offers 1,000
    OpenType fonts. I don't have any experience with this though. See\r\n\r\nhttp://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Product/1150981051301\r\n\r\nIt's
    US$379. Heck, maybe you should consider buying the software just for the font
    collection."

    idea to set up a few workhorse fonts and branch out from there. CS2 comes with
    a few and I've picked up a couple of others I've liked along the way. I'm looking
    into the packages you've suggested as well; I think they'll help me out. Also,
    that Corel Draw trick is a nice catch I might explore.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

    Are they new? Their About section mentions no names. Why so secretive? Wish their
    samples were a bit larger. They strike me as coming from the film type world (the
    letter styles and tight spacing), not quite yet comfortable in their WWW skin.

  body: Stephen-I am surprised...it sounds like fewer people know about Unifonts than
    I had thought. Honestly I can't even remember how I found them, but I have known
    about them for several years now so they are not new. Some of their typefaces
    are geared more toward display, but from what I can tell they are all original...I
    don't think any of them came from old photolettering. There type designs are somewhat
    unique. They have some nice serif and sans-serif faces that can offer someone
    a fresher alternative to the standard workhorses. The catalog is worth having.
    It's pretty straight forward in it's layout, but the samples are easier to see
    than on the website.

    1000 OT fonts; though these seem to be little changed from the TT collection found
    in previous versions of WP. Although, if you're a student, CorelDraw is ridiculously
    cheap, like $100.
