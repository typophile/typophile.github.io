    target="_blank">House Chalet</a> includes all these letter shapes in the Chalet
    70 family, I think. &#40;It&#39;s definitely included in one of the four versions
    in the set&#41;.

    liking any other suggestions.

  body: This one seems better but still a little condensed on the whole the &#39;e&#39;
    is not so rounded. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help though

  body: Hey, that was my thought also! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I did check but found the &#34;t&#34;  <BR>a tad too different.
    You could very well be right.

  body: Alec,  <BR> <BR>The reason I picked the Chalet family is that it&#39;s really
    ten fonts. If you look at the 1960 versions, you see the &#39;conventional&#39;
    letters, 1970 and 1980 contain some alternate letterforms. Paris, London and New
    York are weights for each of the three &#39;years&#39;. The Tokyo face is a lot
    like Bauhaus, and is the tenth font in the set.  <BR> <BR>If you mix the e, t
    and s from 1960 font, with the other letters from the 1970 font, you pretty much
    have what you were looking for, I think. <BR> <BR>&#40;If you ask me, House&#39;s
    way of designating the fonts in the Chalet and Chalet Comprim
