body: "Is there any Textbook of Typography Designing such as how we should set the
  Font Size of Headline on Newspaper or Title on the Textbook, etc?\r\nWhat is actually
  that? Is there some Formulas / Equations to determine the Font Size or just using
  our Creativity, Expression, Imagination, etc?\r\nI am interested to learn about
  that, besides it is my hobby too\u2026\r\nThanks"
