body: "I'd like to hear some suggestions regarding a general purpose serif typeface
  for a lawyers office, to be used in all sorts of laser-printed legal papers, letters,
  and so on. Classic, but not overused. With a distinct, but not obtrusive, character.
  Small caps and fixed width figures must be available.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
