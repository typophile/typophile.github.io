    producing a new glyph that averages the distances between points on two related
    glyphs--they need to have the same start point and number of nodes. The interpolation
    doesn't just have to be a 50/50 average, but can be 90/10 or whatever you want.
    You can also extrapolate.\r\n\r\nThere are two things most available for doing
    this, the MM technology in FontLab, and Superpolator, which has additional capacities.

    drink:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lisbon2006_Ahrens-6_4083.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo
    create your cocktail (c) you would typically pour in a certain quantity (q) of
    drink 1 (d1) and then fill up the rest of the glass (1-q) with drink 2 (d2).\r\nSo:
    GinTonic = q Gin + (1-q) Tonic.\r\n\r\nInterpolation of fonts works in exactly
    the same way. Even the formula is the same, only it is applied to the node coordinates.
    You mix two flavours and what you get in the end is something that, ideally, feels
    like somewhere in between. Unfortunately, extra light mixed with extrabold does
    not feel the same as a real regular just like water plus brandy does not taste
    like wine even though it may have the same \"weight\". I hope this analogy helps
    to understand the issue."

  body: "\"So Interpolation is the process of creating a medium weight from a Light
    and a bold weights ?\"\r\n\r\nIn a way, yes, but it is not just limited to changes
    in weight. Slant is another derivation but that gets trickier. You can have a
    slanted font and an upright font and interpolate something in-between but you
    must have compatible outlines to work with.\r\n\r\nInterpolation is finding an
    intermediate step between to known axis extremes with compatible outlines. Extrapolation
    is attempting to determine an instance which is beyond either of the known extremes
    and projecting what it might look like if the same rules were followed as with
    interpolation. With extrapolation, the odds of failure to make a reasonable image
    is higher and that failure rate grows with the greater distance beyond the known
    axis increases. If I attempt to create an instance of semi-bold between the known
    forms of light and bold, I have quite a good chance of success with minimal correction.
    If I try to determine an instance of an extra-bold from those same 2 light and
    bold known originals, my success rate will be somewhat less. Then, if I use the
    same pair to try to determine an extra black instance, my odds of success become
    even less likely and I will surely need much adjustment to make a tolerable looking
    Extra Black. As Tiffany said, fine tuning is important. With extrapolation the
    tuning is more than fine and requires much work. There is a point of diminishing
    returns where the corrections overcome the value in extrapolation.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    gives better shapes than do automatic bolding routines. That''s because you''ve
    already designed the extremes by eye to match, and the so the intermediates in

    Tim can explain it better, but I think the point is right--it explains Chris''s

    extreme weights in a type family first, and interpolate all the others from these.\r\nIn
    particular, the Thin in a sans serif is a good starting point, as all you have
    to do is draw a path and apply a stroke width."

    does an autobold. \r\n\r\nI was thinking actually of when you use the FontLab
    interpolation tool to get a bold. Somehow always requires a lot of fixing, even
    though it's not totally mechanical--you choose what points to extend, and do x
    and y passes separately. But interpolation between two weights seems by report--I
    haven't done it yet--to give pretty clean results. \r\n\r\nIt just occurred to
    me: Rachel were you maybe asking about the interpolation tool in Font Lab, rather
    than interpolating between two weights? That is explained, sort of, in [[http://typophile.com/node/14255?|John
    Hudson's wiki on small caps from caps]]. \r\n\r\nI admit I don't fully understand

    not. I've used it anyway, just seeing what works by trial and error. "

  body: "<em>It just occurred to me: Rachel were you maybe asking about the interpolation

    interpolation is the same: for any two or more elements in a design space it it
    possible to interpolate intermediate elements. So, for example, one can interpolate
    between two weights of a typeface design to derive a new weight (as in a Multiple
    Master font), or one can interpolate a section of an outline or even a single
    node relative to changes in the position of other sections or nodes (the latter
    is what FontLab's 'Interpolate Nodes' tool does)."

    the results are not as good as could be.\r\nThe first example shows a range with
    2 axii,  regular and bold. Between them (on the 2nd line marked demibold) is an
    interpolation with some need of fixing but still tolerable as a beginning point.
    The last line, as extrabold, is extrapolated and obviously in need of much more
    fixing. It looks better than it really is onscreen in low rez but don't let that
    fool you.\r\nThe second image is a blowup of the \"a\" from the extrabold extrapolation.
    Notice where the curves have flipped on eachother and caused overlaps? This example
    is not even extreme It is only 50% above the axis. If I went to Extra Black, it
    would look far worse. This is as far as FontLab will go though so I can't show
