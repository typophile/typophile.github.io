body: Hello! I just designed a dingbat font (all illustrations) and ran a test in
  Font Book in OS Maverics and it says "can not validate". I use FontLab 5.1.4 to
  generate. I don't have that problem when it's a letter font, only when I do an illustration
  one. It won't totally fine if you override and load it, no problems and computer
  still works fine. This problem does not exist on older OS versions.

    have a basic Latin character set. Perhaps this is a similar problem.

    body: I do have .notdef but I can not remove it for some reason. I have tried
      deleted many times and it still shows up. It popped up when I generated the
      font for the first time and then it's always there. Any suggestions on how to
      permanently remove it?

  body: New FontBook refuses to accept too many hints introduced in the dingbat font.
    Switch autohinting off and it will be OK.

    legacy. Unicode is the recommended way to go.\r\n\r\nThe .notdef glyph is a requirement,
    so don't try to get rid of it!"

    I''m more than willing to turn it over. It''s 74 glyphs of teapots. It''s called
    Tea and Crumpets. '
