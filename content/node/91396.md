  to hear your opinions on this. I\u2019ve been sketching on an off for a while, but
  I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth the effort to finish it. There are plenty of
  geometric sans serifs out there,  particulary the grotesque-ed geometrics. \r\n\r\n(PS:
  You might notice the vertical proportions\u2014enitrely nicked from Helvetica! I\u2019m
  not posting this as something I intend to release in its present form anyway, so
  I figured it might make for an interesting conversation. Is it OK to reuse vertical
  metrics?)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.frodehelland.com/vm.pdf\">PDF link</a>"

    the commitment to geometry is a constraint there.\r\nSpeaking of which, does the
    hard geometry of a structure like /Q/ argue for a single-story, round /a/?\r\nStroke
    width seems uneven in spots (northeast to east of /D/, southwest of /C/c/, south
    of /U/, south to southeast of /g/...) \r\n/s/ looks a bit wide.\r\nI quite like
    the figures! That form of /6/9/, with its straight-to-curve transition, can be
    hard to draw well but you have here. Look to achieve that same success with caps
    like /J/."

  body: "You are off course right. The main issue is reconciling geometry and grotesqueness.
    Graphik, Neuzeit etc sacrifices the former to make room for the two story a, but
    my vision was different. I guess I gotta make that work first of all. And dare
    to go all the way. A two headed frankenmonster, eh? I know this corner is crowded
    :)\r\nI do think the roundness and the proportions, in both directions, has something
    interesting to it though."

  body: "OK, I finally found the time to take a good look at this.\r\n\r\nThis puppy
    has identity issues! In fact it feels like some\r\nsort of test font in a way
    - as if it has intentional mistakes.\r\nOr maybe it's trying to push some boundaries?
    Peculiar...\r\nPlus this genre is so crowded, the only I way it could make\r\nany
    business sense is if it were released by a font house with\r\nloyal customers
    who have been waiting for a geo-grot from\r\nthem. Otherwise you need some distinguishing
    feature(s),\r\nwithout going into the realm of gimmickry however.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    to me worrying about copying the vertical proportions\r\nfrom an existing font
    is a bit too... Calvinistic. :-)  You might\r\nhave noticed the recent thread*
    about copying a font's entire\r\nspacing values - even there people don't seem
    too concerned.\r\nAlso, you might not be gaining what you think you are, since\r\nthat
    characteristic doesn't bestow practical usefulness; it might\r\nseem to be inheriting
    the original's apparent size, but there's\r\nmore to that than vertical proportions.
    And really, a font that\r\nhas descenders longer than ascenders is bad news...\r\n\r\n*
    http://typophile.com/node/90341\r\n\r\nI like them big tittles!* But those belong
    in a text font; this thing\r\nis way too large on the body and geometric to serve
    as a text font.\r\nThere are other strangenesses, but let me first see what you
    think\r\nof the above... And oh, don't forget to take a close look at Unica,\r\nwhich
    is the best design that sits between Univers and Helvetica.\r\n\r\n* Sorry.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "OK. We can do this.  :-)\r\n\r\nI think I had an epiphany, and it's that
    in the past a font\r\nlike this would aim to be highly versatile, but in this
    day and\r\nage it can't survive and certainly not thrive using that ideal.\r\nSo
    it needs to have, not a gimmick, but a certain brashness.\r\nSort of like what
    Swagg does in its domain:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/swagg/\r\n\r\nLooking
    at what you already have, one thing I agree with\r\nyou on is that the width divergence
    has some merit... but\r\nonly in the lc; in the UC it's just looking ugly - but
    getting\r\nrid of it would make the UC deathly boring. So here's what\r\nI think
    you should try: unusually short capitals, which is\r\na good avenue for making
    certain letters very wide. This\r\ncould be a main way to give this thing a raison
    d'\xEAtre.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that struck me is how nice the \"a\" is. And I\r\nthink
    the hook must be playing a big role in that. So try to\r\nmake that hook a central
    theme: see how it looks on some\r\nor all of: f, j, l, q, r, t and y. Concerning
    the \"y\", I would say\r\ngo out on a limb and try the Fleischmann form, with
    a full\r\ncurling hook, coming out of the lefthand diagonal! THAT\r\nwould get
    people talking...\r\n\r\nMore:\r\n- Definitely dump Helvetica's proportions. What
    do you get\r\nout of that beyond dysfunction? Make the ascenders taller.\r\n-
    Try making the tittles square.\r\n- I can't see that \"Q\" working at all.\r\n-
    Numerals: I agree with Craig - they have a lot going for\r\nthem. If you do end
    up making the caps short & wide you\r\nwill need another numeral set to match
    though.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
