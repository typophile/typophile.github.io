body: "Hello,\r\nI have been trying for the past week to contact the author who created
  the font \" A Yummy Apology\" every time I find an email address I get a failure
  response mailed back to me.\r\nThe authors site is supposed to be  \"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/gemnew/\"
  I've also tried to contact him by the various sites that stock this font but with
  the same response as above.\r\nIts strange as I actually want to buy the commercial
  liscense to use this font for a project but I can t get hold of the Author, most
  would jump down your throat to sell you a license.\r\nAnyone got any suggestions?\r\nI
  would be open to using another similar font if anyone has any suggestions. \r\nAny
  help much appreciated\r\nMartin"

    works for your needs or the license is too restrictive why don't you design your
    own font. Start from scratch and make your own. Its easy to do. I know you can
    do it.\r\n"
