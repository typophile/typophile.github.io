  body: "It's Busorama but the sample I found is too bold. Will keep looking.\r\n\r\nHmm.
    ITC has a Busorama Light but the S, E, G and M don't quite match. URW has the
    right S but the M doesn't match and they don't have a light (the lower case M
    matches the sample). The G doesn't match any of them, and the E doesn't either.
    I wonder if there's an alternate character set floating around.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-busorama/"
