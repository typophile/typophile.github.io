  by [[Veronika Burian]] and [[Jose Scaglione|Jos\xE9 Scaglione]] in 2006. The founders
  are based in Argentina and Prague (Czech Republic), respectively. From their description:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"The
  company developed out of the desire to create an independent platform for publishing
  high quality typefaces and to collaborate on new type projects together. Hence the
  name. TypeTogether's focus is on finding innovative and stylish solutions to old
  problems for mainly the professional market of text typefaces. However, there are
  also a couple of more experimental display faces in the make. TypeTogether also
  aims for excellent technical performance, broad language support and at least the
  standard Opentype features.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<strong>External Links</strong>\r\n<a
