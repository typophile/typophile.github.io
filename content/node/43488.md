body: "I am a graduating senior at Pratt in Brooklyn and am working on our yearbook
  (The Prattonia), in which I am using Caslon italic oldstyle numerals quite a bit.
  I'm not crazy about the '1' character (looks too much like an 'I'), so I modified
  it slightly. \r\n\r\nThe Issue is that now I want to apply it to every instance
  within a 112 page book, in multiple sizes, but that requires me to resize the new
  vectorized '1', paste it into each instance, kern it, and make sure it sits on the
  baseline like the original did. Anyone know of a way I can do this, whether it's
  a piece of software (preferably free or something i already own) that can add the
  new character to the typeface, or a trick in indesign?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    image of 1,11,12,13...110 &c. and just place 'em in.

    the number. What would be program could I use to edit the entire typeface?
