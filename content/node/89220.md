    here: http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=202\r\n3) You should move the thread
    (using the \"Edit\" link) to the Type ID Board."

  body: It depends if it's the official corporate font (then you shouldn't have even
    downloaded it) or a "fan font" based on the logo (then it depends on the license).
