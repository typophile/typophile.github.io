  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I would like to recreate this 1940-era design, but would like to use the original fonts if possible. I think it is practical to structure this post using the FAQ available on this board.

<strong>Can I help with the identification of my sample?
As a matter of fact yes. Tell us whatever you know about your sample that might be useful. Information such as the country and age of the sample, and whether it is from a web site, or from a scan of printed material. (For example, if we know something comes from an advertisement published in the 50’s it rules out a lot of possibilities.)</strong>
The sample is printed for the Dutch and/or Belgian market, considering the spelling of the months. It is not sure if it was actually printed in Holland or Belgium, as it could have been imported from a foreign source. The font was designed in 1942 or before. I think there are actually two fonts, one being sans-serif (the months), the other is a serif font (used for the days and the title: 'Kalender 1942').

<strong>Can I have a go at it myself?</strong>
Identifont: resulted in a font from 1965. I cannot rule out that I have given a wrong answer on any of the questions as I am not experienced in typography.

MyFonts’ WhatTheFont?!: I got 8 results but the were all negatives and did not resemble the sample.

Furthermore MyFonts’ keyword search: Waters Titling proved a close match, that is however a contemporary design.

Mike Yanega’s Script Font Identification Guide: I suppose it would be a Formal Non-flowing Script, but I could not identify the font I am searching for on his site.

FontShop’s TypeNavigator: It resulted in Bitstream Carmina Light by Gudrun Zapf von Hesse (1987). However that font is contemporary and notably different from the font I am searching for. However, as with Identifont, I cannot rule out that I have selected a wrong option.

I have tried it, but with these letters (E, K, R) I have not come up with anything that looks close. Do you have any other samples of the serif type? My Guide is mostly digitized fonts, but I am working to include more metal typefaces as well, eventually.

		<div class="commentbody">Another point to remember: just because a font's design date is later than the date of your typeface, that doesn't mean it might not be based on an old typeface design. You should let your eyes tell you if you are close or not.

		<div class="commentbody">Hello all,

First off, thank you for your valuable replies and the research you are willing to do on my behalf.  

I regret not having more samples of said font available, but I am particularly fond of the suggestions which, in my opinion, capture the design of the era quite well...

Don

I am fairly satisfied with the results, I have used Microsoft Office to create this calender, lacking more suitable software. If you have got suggestions for improvement please reply. I used the following fonts:

Kalender 2010: Cheltenham BT 20pt
Months: Futura Lt BT 20pt
Days: Cheltenham BT 16pt bold
Numbers: Cheltenham BT 16pt

		<div class="commentbody">You've captured it amazingly well, considering you're using Office. You could get a lot closer using a graphics program, such as Illustrator, InDesign or QuarkXPress.

		<div class="commentbody">I will look into acquiring a graphics program, perhaps Illustrator. Thank you for your remark regarding the month names, I suppose the design is a bit off in that respect. I supposed that using Futura Bold instead of Futura Lt BT would yield better results but in the end Futura Lt BT proved better suitable.

Another factor, which was pointed out by mr. Yanega, is that the font used in the original is a metal typeface. I suppose that accounts for some of the differences which were noticed by more experienced members of this forum. It also proved to be difficult to maintain the same scale.

On the other hand, using formulas in Excel considerably eased the amount of work required, which is a significant benefit of using Office in this case.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Xcel is very good for making up tables like this, but has a limited degree of control over format compared to a graphics program. In a program like Illustrator, the degree to which you could match the spacing and arrangement of the type and other elements would only be limited by your ability to measure and observe. Even the smudgy ink effects could be simulated with filters. Of course, it depends on what you're using it for. None of that may matter for your purposes.</div>
