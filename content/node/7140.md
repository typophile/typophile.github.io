    was just as nice as he seems on here... <BR> <BR>I really enjoyed most of the
    talks and I found the 30 minute chunks, very easy to digest. The party on Tuesday
    night was a good chance to meet like minded people...  <BR> <BR>I also picked
    up some great 1960s type sample books from the bookstore, and a signed piece of
    John Downer hand painted type at the auction. <BR> <BR>Jim

  body: Sad to say the conference has come to its end, I got quite used to making
    myself at home here at St Bride &#40;I&#39;m still in the library, the books are
    keeping very good company&#41;. Great lectures, nice exhibits as well, and of
    course always a pleasure to spend some time with everyone who participated in
    the event. Especially little Miranda Phinney, who is just the most adorable little
    person I have ever seen. She was popular with the ladies, that is for sure. Thomas,
    thanks for bringing her along &#40;as well as Veronica, she is a dear!&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m going to post some photos in a few days after I get back to Vancouver.
    <BR> <BR>Next year, Temporary Type!

    slept through the party. I am sorry I missed it.

    all the Australians drink all night. I use to find the jet lag worse when you
    go back to BC than when you come this way. Probably since your back to normal
    life and you notice it.

  body: This was one of my favorite conferences ever. It was really quite wonderful.
    Little 4 1/2-month-old Miranda was quite the hit, and took most everything in
    good spirits, though the trip seems to have messed up her body clock so we haven&#39;t
    had much sleep. 3-5 hours is not enough, I fear. <BR> <BR>It was a pleasure to
    meet Jim, though somehow we didn&#39;t end up seeing much of each other after
    our initial meeting. I have a photo of him in a rather amusing pose, however,
    which I will have to send him. <BR> <BR>It was also interesting to meet one of
    Typophile&#39;s lurkers, the lovely Lisa Pomeroy. I&#39;m starting to realize
    that there are quite a lot of people who lurk and don&#39;t post much, meaning
    the Typophile community is in some respects much larger than is apparent from
    just reading posts. <BR> <BR>Yesterday we came out to Reading and I did a three-hour
    seminar on Unicode and OpenType for the MA Type Design students. It was great
    fun, and they asked very bright questions. Unfortunately, Veronica must have gotten
    a bad sandwich at lunch, and seems to have come down with food poisoning last
    night. So we ended up staying overnight in Reading thanks to the generous hospitality
    of Mark Barratt and Sue Walker, and I&#39;m now sitting in the Text Matters office
    &#40;the top floor of their house&#41; catching up on email. <BR> <BR>In London,
    we have been staying at the Mad Hatter, which was the designated conference hotel.
    Very reasonably priced, nice enough, good pub downstairs. Currently has rather
    small beds, but reportedly will be upgrading soon. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    lack of sleep started to get the better of me, so I wasn&#39;t up to serious partying.
    <BR> <BR>One unhappy afternote: later the night of my last posting, I got food
    poisoning, too! Mine was from some dubious Indian take-away by Waterloo station.
    <BR> <BR>I am mostly better now, and back in Seattle. Food aside, we still give
    high marks to the Brits for hospitality. Another good example: people would spontaneously
    offer to help us get the stroller into the Tube station &#40;darn stairs -- most
    of the underground stations aren&#39;t wheelchair/stroller accesisble&#41;. <BR>

    in London. When I was there in 2002, after ATypI Rome, Vince and I went for Indian
    and I made the mistake of having the chicken. Blech! Wasn&#39;t flying home sick

    have to know where to go and where to avoid. I can give a list of my favourites
    to anyone who is interested. I did have a comical experience at Khan&#39;s in
    Bayswater a couple of weeks ago: I took some of the recent Reading graduates for
    dinner, and after we ordered food we turned to the drinks menu and discovered,
    to our dismay, that the restaurant has gone 100% halal since my last visit, and
    no longer serves alcohol. <BR> <BR> <BR>I have fond memories of bookshopping with
    Laurence in Bath. After a day wandering around the shops, I was happy to have
    one slim volume in hand: Laurence had six bags full of books, and had made arrangements
    for a gigantic folio volume to be held until he could arrange to collect it. <BR>
    <BR>Mind you, I&#39;m currently looking at the three shelf-feet of books I brought
    back from Prague abd London, wondering where I&#39;m going to put them!'

    more people we met getting sick&#41;, so I am now inclined to think it&#39;s a
    very sudden-onset stomach flu. Pretty scary, as one goes from no symptoms to violently
    ill in a couple of hours. <BR> <BR>It wasn&#39;t too bad flying home, as I was
    over the worst of it. But I&#39;m sure the fellow in between me and the aisle
    wondered why I had to go to the bathroom so many times. <BR> <BR>The Indian food
    had tasted pretty good, actually. Nice and spicy, the way I like it. Mmmm. <BR>

  body: last month I went to Madrid for the weekend and the day before leaving I was
    sick all night .. the worst ever and spent the day in bed, missed the flight and
    had to stay another day.. maybe the worst well since uni.. but it might be the
    sherry bar we were at &#40;with no food&#41; but it must have been the tapas.
    we had before or the beers after. <BR> <BR>you have to get use to the local food
    because me and the misses went to Boston last thanksgiving and we both didn&#39;t
    really eat that much but felt really weird from the American food. Like it was
    full of styrofoam..Every time I go to America now I get sick from the food like
    they put chemicals in it to make you blow up.
