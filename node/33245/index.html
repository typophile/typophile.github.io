<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Has this been discussed before? I was just reading a thread in the design forum a few minutes ago, and had to give up because one the the frequent poster has an animated icon under his/her name. Interestingly it was a thread about art vs. design. The Art side may say he is entitled to use animation, but the design side says doing such a thing makes it impossible to read threads where he has posted. The animation is continually pulling my eyes away from the thread, ten times a second (or so).
What do others think?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Some browsers can stop the animation. Pressing ESC will do it in Firefox. I'm told that you can hit the Stop button in Internet Exploder to do the same.
Some animations are indeed annoying, but others (such as Eric_West's old one) are truly awe-inspiring.

Firefox can also be configured to allow animated GIFs to play only once, or even to disable GIF animation altogether. See <a href=http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firefox_:_Tips_:_Animated_Images>this article</a> for details.
I would hate to see animated GIFs categorically banned around here; when used with restraint, as in Nick Shinn's avatar, animation can be very effective. I think avatar creation can be considered an art form in itself, and animation is a useful tool in the artist's toolbox.</div>

It is an icon, not a mural. Anyone can come up with a decent icon within 60 pixels. It isn't just "how much space", it is overhead on page load. I would sure rather see pages load fast than turn the icon windows into a Soho gallery space. Look at Hrant's, his is only half that size and still reads well.

<div class=commentbody>I think it doesn't have to do with animating. It's 'how' it animates. Most animating icons draw too much attention it's true. But Nick's doesn't. I think it's just fine. I also think that Hrant probably has the single most effective icon here.
I have said it before but just for fun - my all time favorite is this one.
http://typophile.com/user/3247
It takes a while, but it's worth it. Basically after a minute the moth flys away & 20 seconds later it comes back. It so low key...
Anyway, I would be opposed to a moritorium.

Funny you should say that Chris. I've considered making all the 60x60px Typophile user icons into a giant mosaic/quilt style graphic. Wouldn't that be nice? It could make a rather pleasing, if somewhat noisy, desktop wallpaper.
The non-conformist regulars would need resizing though, otherwise Hrant would be conspicuous by his absence.

That's probably true for me too. Even although I hope I can seperate the text from the icon the icon probably does have an impact. Especially at first.
I also had zero arguement with the Stephen's animating icon.

I fully agree, though I thought you might bring up the madly flapping mammaries of another animated gif seen here recently.
Yes: It's just a visual cue to identify the poster quickly, not ad space. They could even be smaller and still function. I also don't want to be distracted by them while reading. </div>

Wormwood,
1. Do you judge a typophile by his/her icon?!
2. Do not you see beauty in the (curves of) Fish and Cats?!</em>
Aziz, I'm not sure what you think I was saying. I was joking. Maybe you are too. I can't tell :)
1. Never. But I always see the beauty in them.
2. Always. But I never judge a Fish or Cat by his/her icon.

<div class=commentbody>I'd never heard of Martha Stewart, so I guess she's a US institution. Google led me to her website where I found the laugh of the day...
<em>TODAY'S IDEA FROM MARTHA
“ On a bright afternoon, dry the laundry outdoors to conserve energy. ” </em>
Genius that Martha, pure genius.
I like the thought she has a dark side though. Mmmm, naughty. What was she jailed for?
Me and Martha in penitentiary C - O - O - K - I - N - G

<div class=commentbody>She was jailed for unfair trading of stock--a fine American wholesome white-collar crime.
Here is her diary from prison:

I worked for her husband back when she was married. She was a total byotch, the rumors are true. Treated me like a serf. Has the coldest fish eyes I've ever seen.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Did Nelson Mandela ever back his SUV up over a tray of chicks that hatched too soon?
I don't know if that story is true or apocryphal but I can believe it, having dealt with her.
That said, tho, I have friends who work for MS Living and love it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>No, Nelson's only transgression was freeing his people--for that, he got a MUCH longer sentence in a much nastier jail than poor little Miss Martha.

<div class=commentbody>I will take your word for it, Mili.
The dish I pictured is Greek spanokopita--spinich, feta cheese, filo pastery, and herbs. Very tasty. I never find it made as well as my Grandmother's though but I keep hoping :-)

<div class=commentbody>The tough part, Linda, is keeping the pastry flaky and buttery while keeping the spinich filling moist. Most of the time, you get both dry or both soggy. Yiayia knew how to do it!

<div class=commentbody>I had a great one in Victoria last month, as a take away, no less: the secret has to do with high heat to crisp up the base, and squeezing out the moisture from the cheese in the filling.
(And it's "spinach" the last time I looked, unless you've hybridized some new sort of veggie....) ;-)</div>
