  to jpegs and google pop up regularly as do swear words and sexual innuendo.\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for a typeface which is a little more modern or controversial, rather than
  a standard poetry typeface such as Minion, Janson or Granjon. Ideally, something
  maybe more along the lines of some of Barnbrook's typefaces (I like the idea of
  Tourettes, being created purely for swearing), but with more subtle qualities and
  designed specifically for poetry.\r\n\r\nAny ideas appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

    to mitigate against it. However, Panoptica has paid for itself one way or another,
    over time.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Diamonds_4221_4811.png]"

    of Acuta's 'g', but I do like the quirkiness of Jean's Eastburgh. It might just
    be what the client needs to promote his work effectively. Same goes for Panoptica
    , though the verses I'm setting are rather long, which may not work so well.\r\n\r\nCertainly
    something to dig my teeth into..."
