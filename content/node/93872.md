  on a narrow vertical rectangle used as a grid with a 7:2 ratio, perhaps.\r\nIt was
  used for the masthead of an architectural magazine, in 1946. Reminded me of Wim
  Crouwel's Hiroshima poster (1957) and I wonder if that particular typeface was in
  turn based on other typographic/visual trends at the time. Thank you!"
