  here, of course, than I discover that this particular windmill already has plenty
  of broken lances stuck in it, and I\u2019m late to the party. But... <!--break-->\r\n\r\nFor
  the last four years or so, I have been working on this. I program for a living,
  and very quickly got fed up with looking at Courier and friends. Because hubris
  is one of the cardinal virtues of programming, I banged out my own first draft in
  Fontographer, got a copy of MS VTT (for mac os 9!), and have been polishing and
  tweaking the font ever since. I use it as my main programming, email, and web page
  mono font, at first as motivation to keep improving it, but these days, because
  I don\u2019t think it looks half bad.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve now read through the various
  threads on monospaced type design now, particularly Eben Sorkin's Software Developer.
  It\u2019s great to recognize problems I\u2019ve fought with myself addressed here
  (and, sometimes, affirming to see similar solutions to my own!)\r\n\r\nI now recognize
  this is a path well travelled, but it isn't often travelled well. I may yet have
  something worthwhile to contribute.\r\n\r\nI give you: BakaMono.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bakashell_5765.gif]\r\n\r\nMy
  design goals:\r\nUsable both bitmapped and antialiased (I use both), down to as
  small a pixel size as possible. I.e., good hinting.\r\nNot look like a \"slave to
  the bitmap\" like good old <a href=\"http://www.tobiasjung.net/profont/index.html\">ProFont</a>.\r\nMake
  programming typographic idioms as blatant and unambiguous as possible. Heavy, obvious
  punctuation.\r\nAvoid trouble spots that lots of otherwise excellent fonts get wrong:
  the O 0 o test; the l i 1 | ! test; ambiguous punctuation: , . : ; \u2019 ` \u201D
  [] {} () &lt; &gt;; and letters too similar: e @ a o D O g j y rn m z 2 S 5\r\n\r\nA
  much more comprehensive sample is attached."

    of the 'g' in the bitmap version without it becoming a big blob.\r\n\r\nMy only
    concern is with the height of the numerals. '2' and 'z', '1' and 'i' and '0' and
    'o' are all the same height, which can lead to confusion as you've noted. Making
    the numbers just slightly taller could help.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Are you interested in the way this prints? Or, put another way:  how would
    you say you have balanced the print forms vs. the screen forms? Given that this
    is a programmers font I imagine them emphasis is on screen - correct? Do you tend
    to use it in bitmap or anti-aliased mode? The font feels more elegant than a typical
    programmers font. Partly that is the numbers, but it is also the treatment of
    the el & eye as well as detail like the small upper bowl on the cap B. Were you
    loking for something with a refined feeling? Did that just result from looking
    for ditictive forms? What, if anything, would you like to improve?\r\n\r\nMy comments:
    Maybe your x height numbers should gain a pixel in height. Then the crossbar on
    the zero could be more linear and your 2 less z like.\r\n\r\nHow do feel about
    Luc(as) de Groot's fonts?"

  body: "Heh, elegant. I guess that's as good a way of putting it as any. I had been
    thinking \"personality\". I've tried to get some coworkers to try it out, and
    even the idea that the usual default terminal fonts might be improved on is something
    of a hard sell. I had to have something that'll grab them quick, so wherever I
    could I'd in some detail or trick I'd seen done in a better font, instead of conservatively
    following the bitmap. I was just shooting for 'different', so if I hit \"elegant\",
    well, wonderful.\r\n\r\nI must confess... I have not actually tried it in print.
    Since graduation, paper is used in only a vanishingly tiny portion of my workflow.
    So I guess, yes, screen would be the main emphasis.\r\n\r\nI use both bitmap and
    antialiased modes, depending on the physical size of the pixels of the display
    I happen to be using: on a CRT cranked up to where the pixels are smaller than
    the phosphor dots, antialiasing is a huge win. On my monster LCD at work, I can
    use huge type for similar effect. On my little laptop, anything smaller than 13px
    really needs to be bitmapped or the blur overwhelms it.\r\n\r\nI may try raising
    the numbers' \"x-height\" a bit. I notice that's the solution de Groot uses in
    theSans to distinguish o0O.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of de Groot... I haven't yet had
    occasion to use theSans and friends. Looking at the web site, I'm impressed; his
    approach is much more formal than mine, and his families are much more complete.
    EIGHT weights, three widths and true italic, plus lots of \"extras\" like many
    digit variants, alternates and unusual ligatures... does he ever sleep? I look
    forward to eventually seeing some of those extras cooked down into a few full
    featured OpenType fonts.\r\n\r\nhmm, OpenType. I wonder if there are any opentype
    features this could use.\r\n\r\n-- R."

  body: "Probably there is no call for multiple weights while programming.  A Normal
    or 'book' weight would probably be enough. Don't you think? Or no? What have your
    fellow programmers said about the font? What do they like & not? How many of them
    keep using it? What kinds of Open type feature were you thinking of? The idea
    you had mentioned about giving extra room to the 'm' stikes me as a bit scary.\r\n"

    body: "I have one convert so far. He's reporting a strange hinting issue: apparently
      at 11px the 'A' \"balloons\". I can't reproduce it yet but I believe him.\r\n\r\nas
      for extra weights: OS X actually synthesizes a bold (and oblique) when it needs
      a missing one, and does a somewhat OK job, so that may be enough. It's good
      to have though: when using a terminal, there's an escape sequence to switch
      to bold (and reverse, and underlined, and maybe oblique and blinking) characters.
      IntelliJ IDEA puts various text styles to good use with its syntax formatter.
      The more variations available, the more things you can tell apart.\r\n\r\nThe
      hypothetical opentype trick: I think of it as long-distance kerning. The rule
      would have to work like this: If a glyph sequence \"space, char run, 'm', char
      run, space\" appears, substitute a narrower space glyph for both spaces, and
      a matchingly wider 'm' glyph. Similar rules for M, W, w; and i, l, etc. could
      \"absorb\" excess m-width like spaces. I don't know if opentype's rules are
      powerful enough to express a multi-glyph substitution like that, though.\r\n\r\nProbably
      a more useful OT feature would be punctuation case shifting. In any case, it'd
      probably only help Mac users, since I understand on Windows, OT interpretation
      isn't a built-in os service (?) and isn't likely to be added to programming
      editors.\r\n\r\n-- R."

    But as you note, opentype scripting/feature support support must be available.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you hinted this, did you use mostly delta hints?"
