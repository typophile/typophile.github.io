  For Flash, fontsforflash.com? They appear to be connected to FlashLoaded because
  the latter's popup appears on their site. Anyhow I purchased FFF Calypso, a $15
  bitmap font set at 8px, and some of the characters are corrupted, the attached images
  shows the upper line set with the live font and the Y is corrupted, that's the correct
  font size. The lower line is made of letters cut up from their specimen sheet.\r\n\r\nI
  tried mailing them but got an error message saying \"Mail Inbox quota full\". They're
  retailing fonts that are corrupted and not taking emails?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FFF_Calypso_problem_4143.jpg]"

  body: OK, FlashLoaded appear to have taken over the site, they emailed me with really
    helpful support and are going to look into both the wrong support address and
    the font problem so it seems safe to buy from fontsforflash.com

  body: "Sorry for the triple post. Fontsforflash.com contacted me directly following
    this post and told me that the fonts are not intended for use in Photoshop and
    offered a refund. Personally I've never heard of a bitmap font that can only be
    used on one application, a font is a font. Incidentally, I checked the font in
    a trial FontLab against one of the 04b bitmapped classics and found discrepancies.\r\n\r\nThe
    04b fonts are accurately lined up to the guides and grids in the glyph window
    with only positive values in the metrics. FFF Calypso was not lined up to the
    grid or guides and had a small negative value of -7 on the left hand side of each
    glyph.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, each pixel of the 04b font is a multiple of 150
    or 125 units, in FFF Calypso its the same but the problem characters had at least
    one point that didn't add up to round multiples of 125. I think its easy to correct
    but it looks like Photoshop is showing the errors and Flash doesn't detect them.\r\n\r\nOverall
    as fontsforflash say, guaranteed to work as expected in Flash only."

  body: "I remember a few years ago there were issues in Flash with \xABnormal\xBB
    bitmap fonts that would fit pixels perfectly \u2013 the counters would fill up.
    Flash couldn't interpret the outlines correctly. That led to special bitmap fonts
    for Flash where the bitmap \xABdots\xBB were a bit smaller (or larger?) than the
    actual screen pixels; with antialiasing switched off, they would still display
    as full pixels, but the counters were saved. Something like that. I don't know
    if this is actually still an issue in Flash today, and I wasn't aware that these
    fonts don't work right in other apps, but maybe that's what's behind this curious
    story."

    to grayscale pixelfont design, involving how an application decides exactly what
    shade of gray a pixel should be. Photoshop and Flash do it differently, and it's
    quite difficult to figure out a scheme that yields the same results in both apps.\r\n\r\nUntil
    they pulled the plug I worked with a company called Ultrafonts. Unlike others,
    they had figured out the technical issues, and Mana* was one of the resultant
    fonts; it works identically in both Photoshop and Flash. I actually have the source
    code to the Ultrafonts software, but I've never tried firing it up.\r\n\r\n* http://www.themicrofoundry.com/manademo/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
