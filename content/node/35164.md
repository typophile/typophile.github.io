body: "Which Python version is most stable to use with Fontlab Studio 5.0.4/Win? \r\n\r\nI
  use Python 2.4.3 and experience a lot of random crashes and stops when running scripts
  that does a lot of glyph level operations for complete families. It is really random,
  I log each operation and FLS crashes on different tasks each time and sometimes
  it process the whole family without complaining using the very same script and font
  data. It gets a little bit more stable if I add some sleeps in between operations
  or let different scripts execute the same actions one at a time, or process one
  single font at a time. The memory and process levels are quite normal. I had the
  same problems with 5.0.3.\r\n\r\n/m\xE5rten\r\n"
