body: I&#39;m in the process of adding features to a family I&#39;m working on. <BR>Since
  I&#39;m not assigning Unicode values to the glyphs, I&#39;ve been  <BR>noticing
  the order of the glyphs as they appear in FL is different <BR>for the two weights
  of the font. I prefer things pretty organized <BR>so I&#39;m trying to find a way
  to order them without assigning <BR>Unicode values to the characters that don&#39;t
  require them. <BR>Is there a function in FL that will reorder the glyphs this way?
  <BR> <BR>&#40;The below images are from the Light and Bold italics.  <BR>Please
  disregard the casual state of some of the glyphs as <BR>the face is still in the
  works.&#41; <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll notice the Old Style numerals and accents for the
  caps <BR>appear in the FL window differently for the two weights. <BR> <BR>Best,
  <BR>Eric O. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/36194.jpg"

  body: Use Index mode. <BR> <BR>This allows you to set the glyph indexes &#40;actual
    phsyical order of the glyphs stored in the font&#41;. It&#39;s the glyph index
    numbering that determines how FontLab orders the display of glyphs outside of
    those covered by the currently selected codepage or Unicode range &#40;the ones
    whose names show with a yellow background&#41;. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: After I switch to Index mode I notice the glyphs that are  <BR>ordered differently
    by the numbers assigned to them. <BR>How do I change this? <BR>Do I need to work
    up an encoding file? <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Eric o.

  body: Hi Eric, <BR> <BR>With the font window open, use the right click or command
    click to get the pop-up contextual menu and choose SORT GLYPHS. You can then choose
    Name, Unicode or Encoding.  It works for me. <BR> <BR>James

  body: Also note that when in index mode, you can drag the glyphs around in the font
    window to rearrange them. They don&#39;t overwrite each other, they just reorder.

  body: 'Eric,  <BR> <BR>just a side-note: I notice you use names such as &#34;zerooldstyle&#34;
    for your glyphs. I recommend not doing it, but naming the glyphs &#34;zero.onum&#34;
    &#40;my preference&#41;, &#34;zero.oldstyle&#34; or &#34;zero.osf&#34;. This way,
    copy-and-paste in Acrobat will work better.  <BR> <BR>Please take a look at  <BR><a
