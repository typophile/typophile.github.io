  \r\n\r\nThe best I found so far was this guy: http://www.artistmike.com/CertificateDesigns/1.html
  \r\nHe charges $25 bucks for each border (which isn't outrageous, but I'd like to
  find a more affordable, preferably free resource if I could.) \r\n\r\nTutorials
  would be another great resource.\r\n\r\nBorder like these are more desirable:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Page48_6451.jpg]"

    Transform tool to recreate the spirals and stuff, and then show you how to create
    a seamless pattern brush out of it all. '

    same.
