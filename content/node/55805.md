    \r\n\r\nFontLab (the company) doesn't really mind your business and certainly
    has no business in allowing or disallowing you to do something :) \r\n\r\nFontLab
    Studio (the product, which I assume you were referring to) doesn't actually allow
    you to order features at all, because the order of features in the font has no
    relevance. It allows you to reorder lookups, but this indeed is done by changing
    the order of feature entries with which the lookups are associated with. But it
    is important to remember that by reordering the feature definitions in FontLab
    Studio's OpenType panel, you're actually reordering lookups. \r\n\r\nI think what
    John means is that by following the simplistic notion introduced by Adobe FDK
    for OpenType 1.x that each lookup is defined within a feature definition, the
    flexibility in which you can order your lookups is limited. Fortunately, by my
    feature request Adobe implemented the ability to define lookups outside of feature
    definitions in the Adobe FDK for OpenType 2.x syntax, which will be used in FontLab
    Studio 6 (no release date yet). \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"

    criteria, we would live in a world of even greater confusion.\r\n\r\nI have already
    had enough of Adobe calling the \"Creative Suite\" programs \"CS\" (a qualifying
    naming convention which is not based on ANY effective qualification), that you
    won't see me add a \"Studio\" each time I talk of FontLab (which I like, of course).\r\nIt's

  body: "Piccic, \r\n\r\nthe problem is not marketing criteria, the problem is potential
    confusion. \r\n\r\nFontLab produces and sells many applications: FontLab Studio,
    FontLab Fontographer, FontLab TypeTool, FontLab TransType, FontLab ScanFont etc.
    Some users say \"FontLab\" when they mean \"FontLab TypeTool\", others say \"FontLab\"
    when they mean \"FontLab Studio\". \r\n\r\nIt's basically like saying \"I test
    this font in Adobe\", when one actually means \"Adobe Acrobat\" or \"Adobe Photoshop\"
    or something else. \r\n\r\nI'm simply concerned with clarity and avoiding ambiguity.
    Old-timers may understand very well when one uses \"mental shortcuts\" or \"abbreviations\",
    but since this is a public forum with the idea of serving not only 1-to-1 communication
    but also allowing others to learn from what is being discussed here. \r\n\r\nAnd
    realizing that Typophile has users from all over the world, for many of whom English
    may be the third language (like in my case) or perhaps second at best, I prefer
    to stay on the safe side when communicating, i.e. avoid confusion and misunderstandings.
    \r\n\r\n> you won\u2019t see me add a \u201CStudio\u201D each time I talk of FontLab\r\n\r\nSure
    thing, you can call it whatever you want, \"the rusty old thing\", \"the Russian
    pest\", \"\u043B\u0430\u0431\u043E\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043E\u0440\u0438\u044F \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442\u043E\u0432\"
    or \"it\". Some people will get it, others won't. One can never guarantee that
    there will be no misunderstanding but one can minimize its probability :) \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    this is what I mean. It is essentially a syntax and UI issue. But it is interesting
    how is confuses people as to how OT actually works. I recently had an email from
    someone with a lot of experience making OT fonts in FontLab, ahem, Studio, who
    was shifting to VOLT for a particular project that needed GPOS mark positioning.
    He was very confused by the VOLT UI, because he couldn't figure out how to re-order
    the features. :)"

    It's just like the one glyph-one glyph name-one Unicode thinking. Once you introduce
    the notion that some or all glyphs may not have names at all, and that some glyphs
    may be associated with none or with many Unicode codepoints, or may represent
    a sequence of Unicode codepoints, people's minds starts to drift off :) \r\n\r\nWe're
    working on the ideas for a FLS6 UI for OpenType Layout. \r\n\r\nA."
