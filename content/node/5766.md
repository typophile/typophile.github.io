    the coaster, and if so was it the male or female sock puppet from the film festival.
    BTW, am I ever glad the plunger didn&#39;t make it back to me that night. <BR>

  body: Hrant - thanks! <BR> <BR>Joe - good point. My networking skills are as fancy
    as my dance moves. Next time I will document it myself. <BR> <BR>Jill - yay! Glad
    I could get you to post - finally, pictures where I am not captured looking like
    a fool. If no half-split surfaces, the license is yours, if you want it. <BR>
    <BR>Yves - don&#39;t worry about the misspelling. But hooray for me indeed. &#42;cough&#42;buynobel&#42;cough&#42;
    <BR> <BR>Lord of the Ring - thanks. But being pretty and being unphotogenic are
    two different things - I know how many photos people had to delete because I was
    blinking, or my mouth was hanging open catching flies, or just generally looking
    much worse in two dimensions than I do in three. But at any rate, prettiness has
    nothing to do with type. You should see me when I work. It&#39;s giant glasses,
    frizzy hair, and frumpy clothes all day long. <BR> <BR>Now where is the picture
    of my split? Huh? HUH?!
