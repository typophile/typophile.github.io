  My e-mail address is firstname.surname@company.com and it looks really ugly over
  a line break because I end up with my first name at the end of one line and my surname
  at the start of the next line. \r\nIs there a non-breaking period or some other
  way to get InDesign to keep the whole thing together?\r\nThanks :)"

    it via the fly-out menu of the Character palette (or via a character style).\r\nF"
