    letter forms (save for the funky B), and is infinitely better drawn:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet\r\n\r\nOr
    you could modify something like Abode Light:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/search.php?q=Abode&text=Battisti\r\nhttp://www.typespace.co.uk/?p=abode"

    it's very geometric/symmetric and could be easily recreated with some basic shapes
    (circles and strokes); it'd need some time but it's definitely the cheapest way
    to re-do it ;)\r\n- cherry-picked free alternatives in the same \"[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/bauhaus|Bauhaus]]\"

  body: "Thanks for the replies guys, you're really efficient, but ... what prices!
    A little too expensive for my pocket. \r\nI don't have to re-create the text with
    the name, but something that calls the cover art in the same style and font, also
    I would have done with Illustrator."

  body: "Oops, I thought it was an alternate font mostly because of the different
    name. It wasn't my intention, sorry.\r\nYes , you're right , it is not a \"complicated\"
    font, just last night I found one that perhaps comes closer than any other that
    you've kindly linked.\r\nTonight I'll link it paying close attention to which
    site to use. :-D"
