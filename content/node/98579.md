  logo</a>.\r\nTabio is a japanese producer of socks.\r\nConsidering the typography,
  more as a group of glyphs than as a business-related symbol, what do you think about
  this combination of styles between \"T\" and \"abio\"?"

    parts? I think it works well, a moderate contrast within a wordmark is not that
    uncommon. \r\n\r\nTheir kerning on the other hand might be improved a bit :)"

      think in this case the contrast, although it is not really correct in the world
      of typography, allows the logotype to be recognizable and living. With a homogeneous
      typography it probably would not have been so identifying. But I consider that
      contrast not so moderate.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Their kerning on the other hand
