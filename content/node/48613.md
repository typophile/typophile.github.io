    below if those weren't the thoughts you were asking for.\r\n\r\nI can see the
    traditional look you are going for but there doesn't seem to be any reason for
    the base of BOOK to be curved like that. If it was a larger sign with a round
    element below for it to curve around then it would make more sense. Also the small
    capital s after BOOK doesn't look right to me."
