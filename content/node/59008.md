    of things an organization (church?) want to be like and/or achieve?

  body: "*sigh* I expected such responses he he. Anyway, Ricardo is right, it's for
    a law firm outlining their purpose and goals. They want to have it printed on
    a nice paper, framed, and hung in the office, and have given me the task of making
    it look \"pretty.\" \r\n\r\nIt's for my wife's company so wanting to make it look
    nice, but, as I first noted, kind of hit a wall on this one as it's not a project
    I am used to.\r\n\r\nSo once again any thoughts would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    James, as much as I would love to throw some cow dung up on their wall, I think
    my wife would put me in the dog house for that one.\r\n\r\np@rick"

  body: 'I know paragraph was just kidding with his Ten Commandments post, but I''m
    thinking that a two-column page, with a centered title and a bold face for title
    and text wouldn''t be bad. Of course, a bold face might not feel right for a law
    firm. You could also take inspiration from Beatrice Warde''s <a href="http://infoshare1.princeton.edu/rbsc2/ga/unseenhands/labels/wardePrintOffice.html">"This
    is a printing office"</a>: big type, subtle use of color, etc.'

    might be up your alley? I could definitly picture it in a law firm. HF&J suggest
    Gotham as a pair too.

    or Matthew Carter's <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Mantinia\">Mantinia</a>.\r\n\r\nDepending
    on how serious / celebratory they want this to get, this might even be a case
    for a (restrained) blackletter, at least for titling. Mmm."

    thanks Frode.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>I know paragraph was just kidding with his Ten Commandments
    post...</em>\r\n\r\nI thought the same thing, at first was like, yeah yeah, funny
    guy. But really, for a set of rules/statements, it does give a lasting feel for
    authority  and guidelines and I will be keeping it in the back of my mind as I
    lay this puppy out ;)\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks again for the suggestions and examples,
    Cheers.\r\n\r\np@rick"
