body: "Inspired by neutral slab serifs with an added twist, Slab Happy is a typographic
  system consisting of eight layerable fonts with infinite combinations. Slab Happy
  looks best when set in display sizes, but functions just as well at smaller point
  sizes. \r\n\r\nThe complete Slab Happy family consists of: Regular, Bold, Outline,
  3D, Stitches, Fill, Shadow, and Crosshatch.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/will-ryan/slab-happy/|Slab
