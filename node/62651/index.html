  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is something that has bugged me in the past. When I&rsquo;m working with multiple masters in FontLab, and I&rsquo;m creating a new glyph, or a new path in a glyph, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an easy way to transfer what I&rsquo;ve done in one master to another. For example, let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;ve drawn this path in the Wt0 master:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wt0e_6694.png]</p>
<p>This looks good, but if I now switch to the Wt1 master, I get this:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wt1e_5081.png]</p>
<p>This path that is the result of the initial points I dropped when creating the path in the other master. Any changes I made in the other master are not reflected in this master, which makes sense. The whole idea of having multiple masters is for them to be different. However, I must now perform most of the same clean up I did in the other master to get this to where I want it. In the past, I would switch on the option to view the other master at the same time, like this:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wt0wt1e_3470.png]</p>
<p>I could then use the other path as a guide when creating the version for Wt1. It works, but I could save a lot of time and effort if there was a way to make an exact copy of the path from the other master as a starting point. Unfortunately, FontLab doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any way to do this. However, last night I discovered a simple method:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the glyph or path you want to duplicate in the other master.</li>
<li>Create a new (single master) document and create a new glyph.</li>
<li>Paste the glyph or path into the new glyph slot and then copy it.</li>
<li>Go back to the original (multiple master) document and paste the glyph or path into its original location.</li>
</ol>
<p>The path on both masters will now be identical. Note that this will affect <em>all</em> masters. I don&rsquo;t know if there is a way to do this with some but not all masters.</p>
<p>There may very well be some other way to do this, or maybe others have discovered this trick, but I thought it was a pretty good solution and might be useful to other people.</p>

<p>Huh. I guess I&rsquo;ve gotten used to the quirks of working directly in the masters with multiple master FontLab files. It&rsquo;s really not that hard, except for occasional puzzlers like the one above. I find it to be incredibly useful to see how the interpolation is working (using the Axis panel along with the Preview panel and the quick preview in the Glyph window). I worked with four masters the entire time when I did Proxima Nova.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Kartsten, that looks excellent and much more flexible than the workaround I came up with. I should have known there would be a Python script somewhere that did this. Or more likely I did know and forgot about it. I&rsquo;ll try it out. Thank you!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I usually work with Multiple Master and when I design a glyph in Wt0 the other master is all messed up, so I use Tools&gt;Multiple Master&gt;Expand Master in order to have the same exact glyph in both masters. Then I just work on the master Wt1 to design the boldest version. And I do the same both for width or weight axis. This works for me because I&rsquo;m sure that the points are in the same relative position and the paths have the same direction.</p>

But there it is, right in the manual. So, never mind about my clever workaround. It turns out FontLab can do that. On a positive note, I now know about Karsten&rsquo;s brilliant script, which provides a lot more control, so it wasn&rsquo;t a complete waste of time.</p>
<p>I wonder how many other &ldquo;clever&rdquo; workarounds I do to replicate features I don&rsquo;t know about? :-)</p>
