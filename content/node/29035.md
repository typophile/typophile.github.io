  there some advantage to work with one or other way? As an example I've choose Agenda

  body: "Both of those have good and bad features, beyond the issue of extrema you're
    bringing up. The Agenda one has a nice little trap, but it has: a \"dead-BCP\"
    tangent point (left side of the counter) and messy extrema situations on its right.
    The former* is bad because some rasterizers (as well as some conversions from
    cubic to quadratic bezier**) will choke on it - although it's pretty rare. As
    for the latter, I would guess it was caused by mechanically slanting an upright
    form, smartly adding extrema, but then not cleaning up the former extrema; it's
    not necessarily bad, but it's likely to exhibit a mild wobble sometimes; the extra
    points are too close to the  extrema to have any potential curve-defining role,
    instead unnecessarily introducing the risk of wobble due to -unavoidable- grid
    discretization. The Parisine one has clean extrema, but it also has a dead-BCP
    point. In addition -but this is really minor- it has a \"projection overlapping\"
    BCP in the top-left outside curve of the bowl.*** I also don't like its weight
    distribution (to me it looks too light on the bottom-right) but that's not [necessarily]
    a technical issue, certainly not a bezier integrity issue.\r\n\r\n* Which also
    might be the case on one of the points inside the trap.\r\n\r\n** Think FOG, or
    more notably Flash.\r\n\r\n*** From what I know the only issue with this is it
    can make a curve segment look somewhat ungainly, because it pushes the middle
    of the curve too hard from the sides, if you know what I mean; and with some shifting
    of BCPs it can be avoided. But I'm not aware that it can ever cause any actual
    tangible problems.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
