  body: "I think you'll find this is a pretty standard copperplate script \u2013 something
    like Calligraphiques, Kuenstler Script, Palace Script, Marina Script, Youthline
    etc. but with a little hand-drawn swash on the top of that lowercase d. The capital
    'E' may have been squished a bit."
