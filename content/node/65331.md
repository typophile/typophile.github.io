  I'm designing some pamplets for typography students to give them some tips and rules
  to aid them in the assignments given during the semester.\r\n    I've already gathered
  some notes from Letters of Credit, Stop Stealing Sheep, and going to dig through
  Elements of Typographic Style soon, but I thought it prudent to ask you guys if
  there is anything you've noticed, rules or guidelines you stick to, or just things
  that bug you that you'd like students to stop. There are plenty of tpographic blunders
  that get under my skin, but I'm sure if I don't ask for more input I'll miss a few
  key ones.\r\n\r\nThanks for whatever input you guys have. "

  body: "What counts is the careful crafting of visual hierarchy. \r\nI think it's
    most important that beginners learn to work with the different variables at their
    disposal, like size, color, placement, font choice, style, weight, etc etc, as
    well as the power of the \xABwhite space\xBB; and learn to use them with extreme
    restraint \u2013 and with a reasoning behind it. In my view, beginners tend to
    wildly combine too many variables without much reason, and end up producing unstructured,
    messy layouts that don't communicate. \r\nTake it one step at a time, and know
    exactly why you're doing what you're doing.\r\n\r\nHrant, I'd argue that the idea
    of a grid has a much different function, and value, in typography and type design
    respectively. I think in typography, depending on what it is you're making, grid
    systems can be useful starting-points, especially for beginners who mess everything
    up otherwise. \r\n\r\nBut after you tell them to be prudent, and disciplined,
    and thoughtful, by all means tell them to question everything. That the grid alone
    doesn't solve anything. That sometimes it needs to be broken. That in some designs
    it can't even be there because it would kill the idea."

    students a bit about font quality.\r\nWhen my students start in my class, they
    are usually busy downloading loads of free, crappy (pardon my French) fonts that
    are available out there.\r\nIt takes a while before they learn to see the difference
    between well designed fonts and the bad stuff.\r\n\r\nMy students also often ask
    for a list of great fonts to use for different purposes (books, display etc.)"

  body: "Get to know all the things people do with type. An understanding of the possibilities,
    techniques, variables and conventions means informed choices can be made, even
    when you create work that experiments and breaks the rules.\r\n\r\nDevelop a critical
    eye for detail but focus positively on what works best in any given piece. Any
    kind of art needs careful composition and adjustment so as Nina said, be thoughtful
    and purposeful. And yeah, white space is really important.\r\n\r\nAre you able
    to post your conclusions here? It would be fantastic to see you how distil everything
    into a pamphlet. "
