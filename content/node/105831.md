  body: "Yep, that's the font that the Economist commissioned for it's display use
    during it's last remake. After a period of exclusive use it became available to
    the general public.\r\nI should have mentioned that I'm not really interested
    in what font gets the shell-hole and exposed rebar treatment, just in whether
    anyone has done it with any font. For once I was not wordy enough in a post:)\r\nDon\r\n "

  body: i've seen some VERY detailed custom fonts like [[http://www.dafont.com/trashco.font|Trashco]].
    there are even tiny birdies flying around in there.

    to the theme of structural damage caused by war with a shell-hole and exposed
    rebar treatment or a comparable method such as exposed steel girders rising from
    the walls of buildings.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks Jodie. This one is worth playing around with. Using the damaged portions
    of upper parts of letters as exemplified by B, C, J, N, R, S, V and a plain sans
    for the lower parts could be an interesting variation of the shell-hole and exposed
    rebar treatment.\r\nDon"
