  body: "That looks like \"Amati\" by Georg Trump. I think the SC effect is faked,
    perhaps by flattening the 'lowercase' letters. The only digital version I know
    offhand is called Amossa and it was in the Expresiv Ornate collection done by
    Novel Fonts in the mid 90's -- it may be hard to find now, but I have the font
    if you need just a few words set in it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thanks Mike. This is part of a logo I wanted to recreate in vector. I was
    hoping it was just a matter of identifying the font, since I have access to a
    large collection. If you're willing to set the word "Hemisphere", I can manipulate
    it from there. Thanks.
