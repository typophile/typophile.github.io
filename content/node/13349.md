  body: I think you should switch to InDesign. The sooner, the better. I switched
    in 2000 and now I would never use XPress. I would rather change my profession
    than to use it again. I really deplore people who still have to work with XPress.

    I personally don't see any significant improvements with this version and I have
    to say if Quark Inc don't buck their ideas up for version 7, they're going to
    find themselves in serious trouble.\r\n\r\nhttp://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20050608006000&newsLang=en\r\n\r\nDo
    you think he's escaping a sinking ship perhaps? It's an insight to say the least.\r\n\r\nI
    would use InDesign for ANY page layout tasks given the choice... It simply sooooooooooooo
    much better than Quark in every conceivable way and it's compatibility with Photoshop
    and Illustrator means there's no turning back as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nI
    don't work for Adobe by the way :)"

    CS for a lot of reasons and I congratulate myself for that. You will see!

  body: "It seems to be unianimous already...but I firmly agree with all previous
    statements. I use Quark XPress daily at work, but only use InDesign at home. It
    works so much better, its a lot more intuitive...and so far it has never crashed
    on me. Here at my office everyone I work with has had Quark problems. It constantly
    crashes and is very buggy. Its not unusual for me to have to close the program
    and restart it because it isn't rendering properly.\r\n\r\nBTW, Quark files can
    be opened in InDesign. InDesign also has more \"undos\". Quark didn't even start
    having \"undo\" until 6 came out. Quark also seems paranoid about software theft
    requiring a seperate installation and password for every individual workstation.\r\n\r\nWhy
    not just switch to the company that uses all the programs you use in page layout
    programs anyway? You can place native Adobe files in InDesign. I also don't work
    for Adobe. :)"

    with. I switched to InDesign in 2001, and haven't looked back since.\r\n\r\nI've
    used all three of the DTP apps, PageMarker (1994\u20132002), Quark (1996\u20132001),

  body: "Don't any of you have an issue with all major software from one company?
    I do. Competition is good. If you hate QuarkXpress, so be it, but you should hope
    that they make a great product to keep Adobe honest. Seriously, do you think Illustrator
    is going to be updated in any significant way, since Freehand is pretty much dead?
    If you think so, you don't see the market as it really is. What we need is a  third
    layout program that would bring massive innovation to the market. Imagine 3 companies
    combating for top dog? Free sidegrades, 2 million fonts (OOPS), upgrades as we
    breathe!\r\n\r\nI think Indesign does some nice things, but really when push comes
    to shove, you can do most anything in creative ways with either program. I love
    QuarkXpress, have been using it for nearly 18 years. I use Indesign/Illustrator
    at work(PC), but at home I use Quark/Freehand(Mac) and get more done at home.
    \r\nThe biggest fault of Indesign is the poorly thought out box scenario, it is
    too cumbersome to me. I like the Export to PDF, it is better than Quark there.\r\nAlso
    Adobe really won't tell us how large a user base they have, but I have worked
    in Digital print, Label and offset in the last 8 years and can tell you ID has
    very small market share, and I see much more Pagemaker files than ID files. Only
    Corel Draw has fewer users!:)\r\n\r\nQuark has one huge advantage, it is 13 years
    older than ID, we had 7 years of learning v3.3xx and more pages have been made
    in it than any other program. \r\n\r\nI think most people don't like the company
    and push against its venerable program. To be honest, I do not think much of Adobe
    or Quark, but I think it is good that they are both out there.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRodrigue

    my personal musings.  :)\r\n\r\n\"Seriously, do you think Illustrator is going

    Can you say \"Photoshop\"? Seriously, even if one granted the assumption that
    Adobe has no competitors in the drawing program market, that just means that we'd
    have to compete with our previous versions to keep on getting upgrade revenue.\r\n\r\nThat

    eight years ago.  :)\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that today the majority of both
    magazines and newspapers in both the UK and Australia are produced with InDesign.
    The lists in the USA are getting pretty impressive, but I haven't heard anybody
    try to tote up the totals lately.\r\n\r\n\"Quark has one huge advantage, it is
    13 years older than ID....\"\r\n\r\nQuark certainly has a large installed base,
    and a long history. But trying to do radical change on an existing ancient piece
    of software is very difficult indeed - age is not your friend here. There are
    strong reasons, which would apply to most any program, that the Aldus-and-later-Adobe
    folks started working on a new codebase (which eventually became InDesign) instead
    of continuing to extend PageMaker indefinitely. It will be interesting to see
    how successful QXP 7 is in terms of stability and bugginess. Good luck to them
    and their users.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

      but it is more of a \"we have a similar quality\" item. The issue really is
      the same as competitors against Photoshop, it has to be sooooo much better and
      yet familiar enough to existing base, and I can tell you that ID is a great
      program, I really like it, but it isn't sooo much better (I'll even give it
      a 50/50 with quark.) that the \"Large\" chunk of users are going to switch.
      Try it maybe, just to make sure (:\r\nThe part of ancient software puzzles me,
      do you apply the same rational to Photoshop or Illustrator? I am not a programmer,
      but I would think that a change to Unix on the mac side is a complete overhaul
      of any program from OS9 and below, and while they are at it they have new code
      for PC too, uhm or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nThe Truth shall set you free"

  body: "As a recent graduate - my school decided to change from Quark to InDesign
    while I was in my second year (2004) of a four-year graphic design program. I
    had grown up using Quark in high school (basic newsletter stuff), at my co-op
    placement and in my first two years of university. I loved Quark - but was able
    to make the switch to Indesign without any problems.\r\n\r\nAs a student - I couldn't
    afford to purchase Quark. I didn't know <em>one</em> student who had a legal version
    of the program. Once the Adobe Creative Suit came along... you could purchase
    all the programs you needed (Indesign, Photoshop, Illustrator) for around $800
    CND. Compare this to Quark - something like $1,300? (I may be off - but it was
    more). On top of that - you <em>only</em> got Quark - you still needed to get
    Photoshop and illustrator.\r\n\r\nSo, my entire class (and each class following)
    has made the switch to Indesign.\r\n\r\nSince I have graduated, I have worked
    at 3 different employers who use Quark. I am happy to do my work in Quark, but
    do all of my personal stuff in ID. The magazine I work for now is thinking of
    making the switch - since the costs and benefits of the Adobe CS outweigh the
    \"loyalty\" people have with Quark. Other major magazine publishers in Canada
    have already made the switch - including (if I\u2019m not mistaken) Rogers, who
    publishes <em>Maclean\u2019s Magazine.</em>\r\n\r\nYes, it's good to have competition.
    Yes, Quark <em>did</em> a good job. Yes, a majority of well-experienced designers
    still use it. Yes, printers still love it (but do any of them refuse PDFs? ).
    <em>Yes</em>, it will be around for a while longer... but unless something amazing
    comes along soon - I expect that Adobe CS will take over the market as soon as
    everyone still using OS9 (and are living off that Quark 4 license they purchased
    when it was new) decides that it's time to welcome themselves to 2006.\r\n\r\nThe
    next generation of designers is on their way... and Quark missed the boat."
