body: Still here&#39;s an other font which keeps puzzling me. &#40;I only hope I&#39;m
  not abusing with all the many fonts I ask about? It&#39;s kinda hard to help from
  feeling that I am...&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25826.gif"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>This one had been identified as being <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/galliard/"
  target="_blank"> Galliard</a>. Yet, and even considering the uppercase letters to
  be Galliard Regular, and the lowercase ones Galliard Italic, still there are quite
  some evident differences, the &#34;k&#34; to point the most obvious... <BR> <BR>Then
  again, and myself, hum, the closer I got so far &#40;if any close at all&#41; was
  eventually <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/aquinas/" target="_blank">
  Aquinas</a>, yet not too close either &#40;particularly the &#34;M&#34; and the
  &#34;F&#34;, and also the &#34;t&#34;, are definite non-matches, and as well the
  serif is rather different and the outline of the letters doesn&#39;t look as smooth...
  also, and accordingly to the info on MyFonts about it, this font is said to have
  been designed in 1989, whereas the sample I posted is from 1984&#41;... :/   <BR>
  <BR>So, if anyone can give a hint on this one, again I&#39;d be most grateful, thank
  you.

  body: It looks a lot like a Zapf design, like Aldus or Palatino, or even a bit like
    his wife&#39;s Nofret. I have a couple of those, and will try them out to see
    how close it looks.

  body: I think it&#39;s the old display version of Palatino &#40;caps&#41; and Palatino
    Italic &#40;lowercase&#41;. I don&#39;t know if there is a digital version of
    that available. &#40;Seems like every time there&#39;s a change in typesetting
    technology, Mr. Zapf redesigns Palatino.&#41;

  body: 'Yes, I had also tried &#40;at MyFonts&#41; with Palatino too. But had thought
    especially the &#34;s&#34; and the &#34;t&#34; to be not so close... But, taking
    this set which Mark Simonson posted, it does match! &#40;Except for the &#34;H&#34;
    width, indeed, really curious...&#41; And, as a matter of fact, I think this post
    of Mark&#39;s even just solved another <i>mystery</i> for me. As there was an
    other font which I was wondering about, because of its <i>funny</i> &#34;e&#34;
    and, there it is, right that one in that version of Palatino Regular! So here
    goes a double thank you to you, Mark Simonson, thank you indeed! :-&#41; Thank
    you both for all help. :-&#41; '
