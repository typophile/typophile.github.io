  themes like fleur de lis, roosters, etc. Any idea of a website or forum where I
  could post such a request to an experience type designer? Or have I reached the
  right place already?\r\nthanks"

  body: "You have come to one of - or maybe *the* place to ask I think. There are
    plenty of solid type designers here.\r\n\r\nSome questions: Do you want original
    designs based on reference models or do you have the rights to existing artwork
    and want it placed in a font? How many items do you need done? How will the font
    be used? For a magazine? Inkjet? Or to help with designs in ceramic or cloth?
    The use is important to know to get the design technically right. When do you
    need it to be complete? \r\n\r\nFeel free to work out what it is you want further
    here. \r\n\r\nBTW: This is something I would be ready & interested in doing. Certainly
    there are others here who might also be willing as well. If you like, click on
    my name to go to my profile & contact me with details. Then I can offer you a
    quote."

  body: Thanks for the replys ...they were helpful. I am looking a series of 5 embellishment
    templates, into which I can place a decorative object, like a fleur de lis or
    heart. It would need to go into a font file.

  body: So you might be looking for a rectangle an oval and so on as frames for the
    fleur de lis or heart... no? And my other questions - what about them?

    sorry, no snub intended - I am pleasantly surprised you'd\r\nbe into a project
    like this though! :-)  Good luck... to both of you.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yolanda, no I don't mind. Feel free to email me. Do you see how to do that?
    You click on the name & then there is a link on the far right (if the profile
    allows it) then you can fill out a form to send an email. \r\n\r\nBTW : Feel free
    to talk to Zara ( or whoever you like ) too. \r\n\r\nHrant: Even though I am still
    working nearly full time on my own Notan/text face research I am sure an ornamental
    project would be a blast - especially one with a 'french country' theme. I don't
    know why, but that's how it strikes me. Maybe it's the qausi-Mediterranean aspect
    of it. Probably that's it."
