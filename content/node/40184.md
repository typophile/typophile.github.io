  moment I'm setting Cronos as body and using interstate as headers, however I'm not
  that keen on interstate. Can anyone suggest another that might work?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Yep the readership is over 50's, it's a lifestyle title targeted at the baby

    a contemporary edge. Thinking maybe meta might complement nicely?
