body: "I'm currently developing a set of Symbol/Alternate Glyph fonts and have a question
  regarding the font preview in the font menu in Microsoft applications on the Macintosh.
  I'm creating the font in FontLab 4.6, generating the fonts as PostScript with the
  Macintosh Roman encoding for the Macintosh version of the font, and I'm testing
  the font in Word 2004.\r\n\r\nSince the font is non-alphabetic, I would like the
  font name in the menu to substitute to a default font instead of displaying the
  font's name set as a font preview.\r\n\r\nFrom a FontLab forum thread I found that
  setting the \"Microsoft Character Set\" to \"Symbol\" in the \"Encoding and Unicode\"
  section of the Font Info does exactly what I want it to do in Windows but not on
  the Macintosh. I've also tried setting the PANOSE description of the family kind
  to \"Latin Symbol\" but this changed nothing.\r\n\r\nThe odd thing is that in Word
  for the Mac, several other alphabetic font names (Apple Chancery, Bauhaus, Zapfino)
  are shown as a default font in the preview and I'm not able to find out how they
  could be tagged to do this by looking around through the font in FontLab.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone explain how Microsoft Word on the Mac decides whether or not to use a default
  font for the font menu name rather than display the font's name as a preview?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n--
  Andy"

  body: "Hi, the Mac Office people confirmed that they do have a hard-coded list.
    In their defence I think detecting symbol encoded fonts on the Mac has never been
    straight-forward. \r\n\r\nThe list doesn't however include the three non-symbol
    fonts listed (Apple Chancery, Bauhaus, or Zapfino) but apparently they are treated
    this way because their WYSIWYG appearance would be too tall (18 pixels).\r\n\r\nCheers,

  body: "This may be an ugly suggestion, but... given that this IS a symbol font,
    can you hide the glyphs required for the name in the font somewhere and name it
    \xC5\xCD\xCE\uF8FF\xD4\xD3\xD2? Alternatively you could drop the entire name in
    the \xB1 glyph and just call the font \xB1. The disadvantage is that it might
    be part of a family of fonts that you want to appear all together... in that case
    good luck with the above 18px hack.\r\n\r\nRe: 18px hack\r\nWould \"too tall\"
    be defined in the Key Dimensions dialogue box, or by the actual curves when rendered?\r\n\r\nRandy"

  body: "Randy --\r\n\r\nI think that could be a good way to get it to look good in
    Word on the Mac but giving it an unreadable name may cause more problems considering
    the fact that the applications the fonts will most likely be used in (InDesign,
    Quark, etc.) all display the name without a preview. I figure it's probably best
    to just leave it as-is.\r\n\r\nRe: 18px hack\r\nA few quick attempts to trick
    Word into using a default font were unsuccessful, I was able to get glyphs in
    the WYSIWYG preview to overflow into the font names above and below in the list
    so there must be something more to it. I'll let you know if I find anything else.\r\n\r\n--

  body: "Well I know that the trick in Zapfino is that the hhea table vertical metrics
    are designed to clear the tallest glyph, which is a huge swash variant f. We discussed
    metrics at some length with Apple when we were making the font, and they decided
    that although this would result in bizarrely huge interlinear spacing even when
    the taller variants were not used, this was preferable to clipping of those variants.
    After the first version of Zapfino was shipped, the Apple font folk got a lot
    of complaints both internally and from users, that the font looked small compared
    to other fonts. This is because the x-height is so small relative to the regular
    extender length, which we wanted to correspond fairly closely to the em height
    (left at the 1000 units of the PS source fonts, since we wanted to avoid outline
    rounding errors in converting everything to the more common TrueType em of 2048).
    The height of the font's extenders were actually pretty similar to the average
    font, but Zapfino appeared much smaller because the x-height was tiny in comparison.
    When we made the second version -- for which Hermann completely redesigned the
    entire typeface for what must have been the third or fourth time -- we kept the
    same metrics as the first version so that this, at least, would remain the same
    for users. But very late in the project, Apple suddenly decided that they wanted
    the whole font to look larger, so that the x-height would be closer to that of
    other fonts, and so avoid the complaints they had received about the small size.
    Their remarkable solution to this was to leave the outlines and hhea metrics exactly
    as they were already, and simply to change the upm value from 1000 to 400. Of
    course, this means that relative to other fonts the extenders are now huge. \r\n\r\nThis
    is why the Apple version of Zapfino will not fit in the Word menu. Probably more
    than you wanted to know, but I like this sort of story.\r\n\r\nSo you can't trick
    the Word menu into displaying the font name in regular text without also making
    your font behave in some weird ways in applications, e.g. giving it huge interlinear
    spacing."
