body: "Please Help! This font was used in a graphic and I can't seem to find it anywhere.
  I'm not looking for the little tiny one, but the large one, with the prominent 'T\"
  and \"E\" - [The elongated ones]. It's got me absolutely stumped, which is rare
  for me. -laughs a bit-.  The large part of the graphic has been cut away, as there
  was some NSFW/K content. It's not a magazine scan or anything like that. Someone
  made the graphic. I just want to know that primary font, please and thank you for
  any attempts.\r\n\r\n[[http://imaginechat.com/memberpages/Demonatrix/Others/fontstuff.jpg|Clicky!]]"

    appears to be a heavily customized logotype that used Impact as its base. The
    T and E are custom.\r\n\r\nCompacta could also be used to replicate the look.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/compacta-lt/
