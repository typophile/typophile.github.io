  body: "Well my services are more EU based so I'm not really worried with Indian
    tribes because I would never associate it with native Americans.\r\n\r\nBut anyway.
    I was more thinking of a complete regular maze pattern as a logo. More like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maze_5084.png]\r\n----\r\n<em>Robert

  body: I have seen mazes used in consulting and investing advertising. 3D forms where
    people are (or one person is) entering the maze. I have seen it a few times but
    have nothing to reference.

    The client's name was labyrinth, incindentally :) This is not a finished version,
    as the client folded before they got their feet off the ground. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nEric\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/labyrinth_5857.jpg]"
