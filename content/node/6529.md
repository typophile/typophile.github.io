  <BR> <BR>I love FontLab but I&#39;m not fond of the day-glow app icon it ships with,
  so I drew up a replacement. If you use FontLab for OS X and you want to return some
  aqua goodness to your dock, <a href="http://www.xtypa.com/static/fontlabicon.dmg">download
  away</a>.

  body: Nice, Aaron. I was just thinking yesterday how awful  <BR><i>all</i> their
    <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/html/products.html" target="_blank">visual design</a>
    is. Certainly doesn&#39;t do the apps  <BR>justice. But these are clearly software
    developers, not  <BR>graphic designers. <BR> <BR>Strangely, the icon for the FL
    installer is much better  <BR>than the one for the app itself.

  body: Agree, many of us already told them. Anyway, note thta from the 3 version,
    the start up screen illustration is became transparent and transparent, perhaps
    one day, it will be completly white. <BR> <BR>thanks for the icon!

  body: I have a question on how to make that my icon. I just did the upgrade from
    Fontographer to Fontlab, oh happy day, and now would really like to &#40;also&#41;
    get rid of that icon. I know how to copy and past other icon, but this one doesn&#39;t
    seem to work the same. Sheesh. You would never guess that I have been tinkering
    with macs for so long. But I guess I am a newbie in the long run.  <BR> <BR>I
    was told that I shouldn&#39;t be such a chicken. Please don&#39;t hurt me. ;^&#41;
