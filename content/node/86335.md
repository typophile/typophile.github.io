  body: "The problem I have is that I don't know what you mean by \"the secretive
    notion of a city\".\r\n\r\nWhat is the secret? The definition of a city? Something
    about the city? The secrets the people in the city have?\r\n\r\nIt is true that
    a big city provides people with a level of anonymity, that lets them keep secrets,
    compared to a small town where everyone knows everyone else. Is that what you
    are referring to?\r\n\r\nThe first suggestion, by David Sudweeks, of a typewriter
    face, seemed like a very good one to me - but that relates to one specific kind
    of secrecy. The idea there is to suggest a telegram, perhaps sent in cipher, serving
    the purposes of diplomacy, espionage, or military activity.\r\n\r\nBut if that's
    not related to the images you wish to evoke, it may not work for you.\r\n\r\nIf
    it is the secrecy that results from big-city anonymity, you may, for example,
    want two faces that are so different that words in them look like they're \"talking
    past each other\".\r\n\r\nAlso, there's a display face made up of letters that
    look like cloaked people with caps on their heads..."

    Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut which is the stone that
    supports the bridge?\u201D Kublai Khan asks.\r\n\u201CThe bridge is not supported
    by one stone or another,\u201D Marco answers, \u201Cbut by the line of the arch
    that they form.\u201D\r\nKublai Khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds:
    \u201CWhy do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to
    me.\u201D Polo answers: \u201CWithout stones there is no arch.\u201D</blockquote>"

  body: "I apologize for not clarifying myself. The challenge is to create a type-only
    representation of the city of Chicago and my chosen word is secrets. The type
    (symbols) can be used as icons (resembling, imitating: visual noise, height, space,
    &c.) or indexes (association: e.g. audible noise, power, direction, &c.) or in
    combination (icon/index).\r\n\r\nI chose the word secrets because I am referring
    to the fact that a city provides people with a level of anonymity and also from
    my experience, I am not familiarized with many of Chicago's neighborhoods, history,
    etc. so I find the city to be very concealed at times.\r\n\r\nBut I do find beauty
    in this because I know that Chicago and many other cities in general have hidden
    gems waiting to be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe task really is to discover how the cities
    talk to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n@Nick-thanks for the book referral, I will have to check
    it out soon."
