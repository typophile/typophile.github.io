body: 'Basically, I''m just starting out in type design. The biggest problem I face
  is that, whether we like it or not, we all walk around and subconsciously take in
  things and copy them later. So I suppose my question is: How do you know that your
  design, something you may indeed spend years developing, is original, or at least
  different enough from what''s out there? It seems impossible to be aware of ALL
  typefaces out there. The good ones, yes that''s possible, but there must be unknown
  type designers out there doing fantastic work.'

    is design a concept first and then the actual design.\r\nEverything you do has
    been done before by an other. Being 100% original is impossible.\r\nYou could
    try, but it is hard.\r\n\r\nIt is no shame looking around for inspiration. But,
    be aware of copying.\r\nIf things have no purpose, just leave them out.\r\n\r\nI
    a way trends are an example of this. Light letters, gradients ... you see them
    around.\r\nAre you less original when using that? I think it is about communication.\r\nWhat
    is it you want to communicate.\r\n\r\nIf you can start a trend, I think you are
    original. Even though the actual trend has been done before.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope
    this helps.\r\n\r\n"

    moment in my mid-twenties when I stopped practicing and started playing. That's
    also when I stopped being a fan.\r\n\r\nAfter that I was not interested what other
    musicians were up to, especially those that were doing something close to what
    I was trying to do.\r\n\r\nBeing a primarily an ear-trained musician means that
    whatever I hear, I play. So I have to be really careful not to get poisoned.\r\n\r\npbc"

    is right on the mark. \r\n\r\nI've had this conversation with many of my type
    design colleagues and the consensus is that not looking at other peoples work
    is the best way to stay true to your own ideas. I suppose it is easier if you
    only design type and do no graphic design. But I stopped doing graphic design
    years ago, so I have no need or desire to look at other contemporary work,\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "It's very easy to make your glyphs original.\r\nJust don't refer to other
    types when you're drawing them.\r\nIf you start with a concept, and then work
    it out by drawing the glyphs, then the natural personality of your \"hand\" (including
    eye and brain) will express itself in an individual creation.\r\nYou will get
    the shape of the glyphs \"right\" not by comparing them one-on-one with the glyphs
    of other typefaces, but by trying to make your face work in various text settings.\r\n\r\nConsider
    the featured face Netto. It looks to me like \"Dax meets DIN in a Rapidograph
    template\". That's a sufficiently original concept, if drawn out the way Daniel
    Utz has done it, with his own taste in the proportions of the letters, the quality
    of the curves, and the \"speed\" they transition into the straights. Then there
    is the question of fit, determined by the width of sidebearings among other things."

    has that got to do with my advice?\r\n\r\nIt's a bit harder to make revivals \"different
    enough\".\r\nSo beginners seeking originality should avoid them.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    taking a crack at reviving an incunabula face might not be a bad idea--the print
    quality is so rough that a lot of interpretation is required. If you're going
    to do that, best to avoid Jenson and Griffo."

  body: I don't partake in type design, but do in graphic design. The best way I've
    found to combat unoriginality is to accept I'm most likely not going to design
    something that is 100% original in every aspect of it's being. By accepting that,
    I'm not worrying about something so much, and can instead focus on what the design
    can be and not what it can not be.
