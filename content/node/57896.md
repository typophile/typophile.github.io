  a sencil from a printout, traced it onto wood and routed out the attached property
  sign.\r\n\r\nIt's time for another sign and I'd like to duplicate or closely replicate
  the font in the attached picture. \r\n\r\nAny of you Creative people wanna tell
  me where to go? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Far Side Sign_4012.jpg]"
