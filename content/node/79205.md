  the Uppercase for now. Any comment/thoughts/suggestions are welcome. Need some fresh
  eyes on this. Thanks so much.

  body: "Hey, great start!  A couple of suggestions:\r\n\r\n- The middle 'Q' doesn't
    really fit. I'd definitely choose the first or third, not sure which yet.\r\n-
    I'd remove the slabs on the bottom of the 'W'\r\n- Something about the 'J' looks
    off.  Maybe the curve needs to be smoother, or the bottom needs to extend more.
    \r\n\r\nKeep at it!"

  body: 'Looks good! I agree with Trevor re: Q,W, & J. Also, B and S look a bit top-heavy.'

  body: "I like the feel! (I've always been a sucker for slabs)\r\n\r\n- Given that
    the glyphs have a horizontal pull, the middle /Q/ seems like the best fit. Definitely
    not the third, with its vertical tail. If you go with the first one, though, I
    think the tail needs to be a bit thinner\r\n\r\n- I agree about the /W/ and /J/,
    though. Maybe if the /J/ were pulled in and had a vertical serif? /W/s are tough
    in bold slab serifs. They look bad with bottom serifs and look top heavy without
    them. Without is the way to go, though, I think...\r\n\r\n- /M/ looks uneven in
    weight. The diagonals are a bit too thick.\r\n\r\n- /S/ looks a bit light. Also,
    its top curve looks lumpy, and I think jacobsievers is right, it looks top heavy
    (almost like it's upside-down.\r\n\r\n- You might pull in the upper bowl of the
    /B/ just a tiny bit."
