  body: "All bets are off on manufactured letters.  There's really no reason why a
    'font' would have been used, although perhaps the design was based on a type style
    that may have existed at the time. These are two different sans lettering styles,
    with the first one looking like an Art Deco-era (1930's) style, similar to Neutraface
    from House Industries.\r\n\r\nAvenir might be similar to the second one, but remember,
    with manufactured letters the ability to manufacture them probably takes priority
    over fidelity to any type that may have been used as a model. These may have been
    built from custom drawings with no connection to fonts, especially digital ones.\r\n\r\n-
