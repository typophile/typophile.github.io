  from SIL's to Microsoft's? And why?

  body: 'My guess is that the current policy is that Wikipedia content should not
    specify fonts and allow the browser to select an appropriate font. So maybe in
    the past some content specified a proprietary font, but now they let the client
    choose. Perhaps your browser lets you choose which font should be used for a given
    range? If so you can pick the appropriate font for IPA. '

  body: "I am currently using Firefox 6.0.2 on the Mac and there is an interesting
    option. In the settings on can specify a favourite custom font for text display,
    and the website-specific proprietary font-choosing can be disabled. Those two
    functions together cause the browser to render all text content in the font of
    your own selection.\r\nIt then comes out that a Wikipedia-site such as the one
    on Phonetics is a veritable tester for the performance of a given font."
