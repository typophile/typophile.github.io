body: "Hello everybody! My name is Taylor Buley -- I'm an undergraduate at the University
  of Pennsylvania and editor of the Pennsylvania Independent. I've got a pretty cool
  project that I'm currently working on and wanted to get you guys in on.\r\n\r\nA
  little while back, due to copyright restrictions on our masthead we were forced
  to change our banner. We went for the more modern look you can see at <a href=\"http://www.pennindy.com\">the
  top of our website</a> and in the PDF issue. We tried to compliment the modernity
  by raising the photos and giving them drop shadows.\r\n\r\nWe want to continue the
  modernization process by choosing and establishing a new font for the header, the
  byline and the text of the paper.\r\n\r\nOur only competition is the <a href=\"http://www.dailypennsylvanian\">school
  sponsored rag</a> -- whose been recieving school funding since 1879 and hasn't updated
  their style since. We already have better journalism, so I want to compliment our
  work with a fantastic canvas to print on.\r\n\r\nSo I'm turning it over to you guys.
  Are there fonts you think would work well? We have little to no budget, so freeware
  is preferred; but cheap files can be considered. There's so much that needs work
  that I'm sure you all will have some good suggestions. Thanks!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.pennindy.com/PennIndy.v1e2.pdf\">LINK

  body: "The most important thing you can do is to fine-tune the typography of your
    text type.\r\nThe variables are :\r\n-column width\r\n-type size\r\n-leading\r\n-tracking\r\n-H&J
    setting\r\nNotice that I haven't mentioned choice of font.\r\nAnyway, experiment
    by doing test settings of the same piece of text, varying these typographic parameters
    slightly against one another, until you have a setting you're happy with."

    kidding. I won't even get into that whole relationship. I would definitely listen
    to what Nick Shinn has said. Even if you go out an buy the 'best' two or complimentary
    typefaces they'll be nothing if you don't learn how to use them correctly.\r\n\r\nI'm
    also not sure how giving your photos drop shadows makes your paper more modern?
    Go out and study as many instances of magazines/newspapers as you can. You can
    then start finding what you like and what works and work it into your own publication.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

    the Newspaper Name bigger (solution) Condense type. \r\nA display typeface should
    stand out. \r\n\r\n30 - 50% bigger!\r\n\r\nOkay I'll provide you a link to an
    example soon 30mins from now. \r\n12:45pm\r\n\r\nokay the headlines should have
    a similar size in type. (smaller than the name of the newspaper. UNLESS, you want
    to use type as an image for style. LIKE, \"9/11\" or \"BLACKOUT\"\r\n\r\nthe text-type
    or body type should be 8pts - 12pts depending on your audience with dim eyesight
    (san-serif) franklin gothic, trade gothic, news gothic to name a few.\r\n\r\nAnother
    suggestion. Perhaps you paper can be abbrev. call \"PI\" \r\n\r\nwith a logo created.\r\n\r\nPennsylvanic
    Independent may be white type on black backeground as a masthead, just to throw
    in some ideas.\r\n\r\nHope it's helpful!\r\n"

  body: "Alright, I've done my research. Some things I've learned that we'll be using
    in issue three:\r\n\r\n- the value of small capitals, and lower-case numbers\r\n-
    justified text optimizes space and brings with it a more formal feel\r\n- serif
    text fonts are dramatically easier to read\r\n- headlines set in all caps are
    significantly harder to read than mixed case\r\n- a single, consistantly used
    graphic as a bullet can make it sexy\r\n- always hang paragraphs with bullets\r\n-
    no more than two typefaces on the page\r\n- one font pt. is exactly 1/72\"\r\n-
    w/justified columns, never allow letter spacing to vary; eliminate gaps and rivers\r\n-
    never underline text; apparently it's a style leftover from typewriters that didn't
    have italics\r\n- generally, a line should have 55-60 characters, or 9 to 10 words
    for optimal readibility\r\n\r\nQuestions I still have:\r\n\r\n- can quark automatically
    fix ligature combinations?\r\n- can it replace true quotation marks with curly
    quotes?\r\n- what is a good leading height?\r\n- does quark do kearning?\r\n-
    what could I do better with the column width? Go to 5 column?\r\n- type size:
    with a college audience, is 12 pt. too big?\r\n- tracking.. what is this?\r\n-
    H&J setting.. what is this?"

    you should cater for them but here again it depends on the font choice\r\n<em>-

    is spacing a whole line or word\r\n<em>- H&J setting.. what is this?</em> \u2013
    this is a preference in Quark under the edit drop down menu that allows you to
    specify the limits of tracking that is applied and the number of hyphens allowed
    per paragraph there are threads about the optimum settings on Typophile this is
    only one of them\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/3989\r\n\r\nHope this helps
