  at the University of Reading for the first term of the year; so I am looking for
  a flatshare in Reading from october to january. I have been offered a place in Hillside
  Court but the contract is on a yearly basis (three terms), so I have to decline
  the offer. Is there anyone interested in a flatshare for this period? The database
  of the university doesn't seem updated, so I don't know where else to search.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"
