  I have started all over again and think I've made a logo which is much more consistent
  and has more of the expression I'm looking for. As with last time I need some hardcore
  critique of it, since I've become a little blind.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Authenticore2.png]"

  body: "The e's are a bit sharp at 6 o'clock and a bit light compared to c and o,
    perhaps c and o could be a touch thinner and e's a touch broader with the connector
    smoothed I think for the final e you could afford to make the last stoke a bit
    heavier. It is difficult to see with the scrolling but the Au space seems a bit
    wide and the loop at the beginning of the u might be a little more pronounced.
    The connector on the he seems a bit broad at the beginning of the out-turn.\r\nGood
    advance from your first post.\r\nTim"

  body: "Thank you for the good advice. I've done some modifications according to
    what you said and it seems to work better now. However, something still feels
    wrong with the r. Is it too heavy with the closed loop?\r\n\r\n(I've managed to
    shrink the image a bit. but it seems like it won't become any smaller. The image
    I uploaded now is 300 px wide. Must it bee even smaller?)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Authenticore3.gif]"

  body: "I love that r, true it does draw attention to itself, but I think it is a
    charming shape and the weight is no more than the th, if anything the righthand
    side of the loop could be rounder. I still see something unsatisfactory about
    the last stroke of the last e, but I can't put my finger on it, maybe somebody
    else can come up with an answer (probably that I'm wrong:).\r\nAs for the size
    it's the devil and the deep blue sea \u2013 one is too large and the other too
    small, I think you have a happy medium.\r\nTim"

  body: "Yep, i also really like the r.  Great Logo by the way, its really expressive.\r\n\r\nIs
    this a modification?  Or have you modelled it on someone's actual writing with
    a marker?\r\n\r\nThe only thing bugging me is the x-height of the 'e'.  It seems
    a little bit low, but then again, that is probably in keeping with how we actually
    write (?).  But, maybe its the higher 'r' combined with the lower 'e' that is
    leaving timd 'unsatisfied'?\r\n\r\nGood luck, although i think your pretty much
    there... ;)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks a lot! It's not a modification. It's only based on my handwriting
    testing how the strokes go when I write. I've drawn it by hand in ca. 8 cm height,
    which I feel give me the control I like. Only the final adjustments are done in
    Illustrator.\r\n\r\nThe final version is here:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Authenticore4_4372.gif]"
