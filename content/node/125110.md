body: "Hello everyone,\r\noften when I feed glyphs in the WTFont search engine, it
  breaks the glyph into various components, e.g. the \"i\" is broken into the stem
  and the dot. It gets much worse when I have to sometimes use fonts with effects
  or otherwise peculiar shapes. Do you have any solution for this?\r\n\r\nAlso, is
  it just me, or is WTF returning slightly different results if one uploads different
  sizes of the same picture?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance"
