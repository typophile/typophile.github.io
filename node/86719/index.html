  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Fellows,</p>
<p>I wonder if I am being too much of a zealot here, but I would tend to think that all-caps fonts, like Trajan, are best used without case changes, i.e. sticking to the upper case height. I know the opposite has become common practice, but I would attribute this to a certain lack of information and maybe even a lack of feel for the monumental, sigillary character of these designs (I am really having Trajan in mind, or similar designs). If I get the idea right, these fonts are not meant for prolonged reading, but for a short text that stays stamped on your forehead for ever, sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>On the above grounds, I would go for 2 or 3 in the attached sample (part of a project under way). Please disregard the second line, as my query only relates to the top Trajan line. This text will be at the centre and top of a website, all its subpages etc.</p>
<p>Comments, suggestions, chidings and admonishments are gratefully welcome.
Juan</p>

I don’t know if Optical metrics is to blame, or if you’ve manually fiddled with it, but the spacing on this title is a bit uneven. The natural fitting that Twombly built into the fonts is much more balanced in general.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you both. 
@kentlew: I confess to having manually fiddled with the kerning. I try to be a little wary of inbuilt kerning, and to try manual adjustments when it comes to this kind of stuff (following Tschichold&rsquo;s advice), but I&rsquo;m very grateful for your comment. I&rsquo;ll try to come closer as natural as possible. Still, wouldn&rsquo;t you think that this font&rsquo;s natural HE pair (for instance) is a bit too open?</div>

<p>No. Especially not compared to the limitation of TH.</p>
<p>In your case, the TH pairs you have are always going to be open — that’s the nature of T. So everything else should be balanced against that visual space.</p>
<p>Also, Trajan has a very open O; there’s nothing you can do about that large counter. So, between the forced spaces of T and O, your HESON ends up looking unnaturally tight (at least to my eyes) and you’ve isolated and exacerbated the spaces under T and inside O.</p>
<p>Look at your primary word MATHESON — the MATH will always be open because of angular M and A and wide T. Next to these HES is too tight. SO and ON are also too tight for that O.</p>
<p>I suppose one could try to make an argument for a 1970s-style tight-but-not-touching setting, but that goes completely against the nature of Trajan and against the kind of majesty I think you’re trying to project with this title.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Kent: really grateful for your explanation. And we take our vision for granted! I shall have a slow new look at this case and in general to caps kerning. Gracias.</p>
<p>@Nick: we may have to stick to typographic Eurocentrism, alas, since we are in Londinium, publishing in English, within Western academic standards, travelling on the Tube&hellip;but seriously now, what would be an alternative? I would think for most people, who are unaware of Trajan&rsquo;s imperial associations, it is simply a beautiful font, or simply the same font on the film posters. They are used to it. What would be a less Eurocentric font using the Latin alphabet? I think I see your point, but I can&rsquo;t think of an alternative&hellip; may I have a hint?</p>
