  logos make me feel fuzzy and warm - unless they're ugly!\r\n\r\nI do find it interesting,
  however, that many well-known brands are currently rebranding themselves. I think
  it's in part of reintroducing themselves in a more competitive (thanks to the recession)
  market. If you see something thousands of times, it loses its impact, much like
  the nike logo and mcdonald's arches have become fixtures in our modern culture.
  We see them too much, and therefore pay less attention. Should this theory hold
  water, it gives me hope for future endeavors - business always needs graphic designs.
