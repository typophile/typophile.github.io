  things to do!\r\nAnyway, here I am again with a new doubt.\r\n\r\nI'm about to make
  a new cover for an old book, so my idea was kind of a revival.\r\nI want to bring
  back the old cover swashes... done by all the great leaders and pioneers of the
  type.\r\nSo, i'm here to ask you to help me on this research... Things to look for
