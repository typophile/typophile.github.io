    Mono</a>, custom designed for the Danish Jyske Bank, is not available for general
    use. Maybe Lucida Typewriter? I'd be interested in getting an actual machine typewriter
    to work well with Dolly, though.

  body: That Monospasz seems very nice, but the regular is a bit to narrow and the
    extended a bit to wide in my opinion.
