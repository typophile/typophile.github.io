  called 'The Sherlock Holmes Scrapbook.' The printing in the book was a little less
  than crisp, but should be identifiable, I would imagine. Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nD"

  body: If it was a blurred Times I think the ball terminals on "a" and "f" would
    have survived. Also the shape of the "a" and "w" are just not very Times-ish.
    I expect it's a real sans. In fact, it looks very familiar....

  body: Actually it looks quite a bit (though not exactly) like Sabon Sans on which
    we recently had a [[http://www.typophile.com/node/66901|thread]]!

    the missing ball terminal) and the \u2018w\u2019 do look a lot like Times."

  body: "I've been looking at this, comparing samples of Times with the sample text,
    and I think Jan is right. Every proportion and stroke matches Times with the terminals
    and bracketed serifs removed. The one letter that would clinch it for me is the
    G, which is quite distinctive for Times. Do you have a sample showing a G?\r\n\r\n-

  body: Yeah, if you chopped bits off it could have been derived from Times. But not
    just from blurring it.
