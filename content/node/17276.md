    how hard can it be? :^D

    target=\"new\">EF Metropolitain</a> is very similar, but I don't think it's the
    same.\r\n\r\nThe centre of the M doesn't reach the baseline, and I know the sample
    is very small but the E looks to me as though it could be based on a lower case
    form, and the O seems to be wider towards the bottom.\r\n\r\nI would have thought
    that there would be quite a lot of information on the net about these signs, but
    a quick search didn't come up with much of use.\r\n\r\nRichard"
