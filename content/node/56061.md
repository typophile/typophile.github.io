body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm having a tough time finding a font for my husband's (yep-another
  result of our bad economy) resume. He works or worked in the financial sector. The
  current resume is in Times and it pains me to look at it, yet I can't find a font
  that is \"strong\" enough (his words-he wants it to look strong) to match it. Simple,
  sophisticated and strong-no sans. So silly, but I think I'm too close to it and
  afraid to choose the wrong font and sabotage potential job suitors. I'd appreciate
  any ideas...\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    is more weighty in all the right places

    are very blunt giving it the elegance of a serif with the no nonsense attitude

  body: 'I tried Souvenir and it''s too modern with the x-heights being too big for
    what I''m looking for. Thank you though. Tried Garamond, Caslon and they didn''t
    have the no nonsense heaviness and contrast that Times has. Arnhem is beautiful
    and right on target, but too expensive for us right now. Aluminum, you made me
    laugh here-bite your tongue for saying that on a font-lover''s website. :o) Yes,
    I guess since he is in the financial field, it doesn''t really matter. I guess
    I''m envisioning some person in HR, exhausted from looking at Times resumes all
    day, and then she happens upon my husbands resume and feels a sense of calm that
    makes her take a second look (because of his carefully chosen font, of course.)
    Very silly. But really, this has spurned a question in my head-are there any well-known
    fonts that are Times-like? '

    default MS Word Resume template.\r\n\r\nThat probably doesn't apply to anyone
    already in the creative field (unless they use it ironically ;o) but I can see
    that being an issue everywhere else where 90% of all the resumes use that exact
    same template and blend in to the background.\r\n"

  body: "Some employers and recruiters require applicants to upload or email resumes
    as MS Word files. If you use a font the employer doesn't have, Word may default
    to Courier, so it's best to use a font almost everybody has. I like EK's suggestion
    of Georgia, because just about everybody has it, but it looks more sophisticated
    than Times (and the old style figures are a nice touch since your husband is a
    numbers guy).\r\nIf you're sending a Word file, set it up correctly. Use styles
    instead of manual formatting. Avoid <em>Based on Normal</em>, as the recipient
    may have different <em>Normal</em> settings than you do. Never use extra hard
    returns to create space above headings and list entries; make this an attribute
    of your paragraph styles. Ditto for indents. Turn on smart quotes. \r\nAnd for
    heaven's sake, spell everything right. Your husband wouldn't <em>need</em> a job
    if he had a dollar for every \"Principle Engineer\" out there."

  body: "Thanks so much for all of your suggestions-and I will keep Rawlinson in mind
    for a future book design as I need readable text fonts often. I ended up going
    with Times as I was afraid to default to Courier. He usually does upload text
    resumes so I want to make sure it goes through properly. I've set it up in INDD
    and will give him PDF's to send out. Word is not my strong suit :o) I agree with
    your spelling comment. My cousin, a straight A student going to a great college,
    can't spell to save her life. I blame texting.\r\n\r\nTnks agn."

    \"[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/leitura/roman-3/|Leitura]]\" which I think
    is quite sturdy and Times-ish. You might like it. If you can get by with just
