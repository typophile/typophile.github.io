		<div class="commentbody">There are certainly more male graphic designers, but the most dramatic gap is between the numbers of men and women in <em>type design</em>. There are probably fewer than fifty women who have created commercial fonts. Women are not scarce in calligraphy and lettering classes, and the number in type design programs at Reading and KABK are all far greater than those who become font makers. No one has adequately explained to me why this is.</div>

<p>I absolutely agree, when I did my degree in design, the ratio of women to men was around 3:1! I think things has definitely changed in the past decade or two as with everything else.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I studied graphic design in both the US and in Germany. In both countries, the male:female student ratio was 1:3. This was very recent, though.</p>
<p>Frightening was the teaching staff ratio. In the states, there were female professors, but not as many as there were men. Where I was was studying in Germany, there were no female professors in the design department at all, despite the department having recently hired several new professors, and the student body ratio. (I think that this might have improved though in the year that I&rsquo;ve been out…).</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak to the working environments back home in the States anymore. In Germany at the moment, lots of designers are graduationg and not getting jobs for a long time. Many of these graduates start working freelance, or try to found their own studios (out of desperation?). Since there are more female and male gradutes, it seems like there are more women not entering the workforce… but demographics play some role here. The average German design graduate is not 21 but about 28–32, I&rsquo;d say. Some women opt straight for motherhood once their studies are complete. <em>Some</em> of these women who become mothers will, if the impression from the past decade is to be believed, never enter the design workforce at all, other than in a part-time/freelance capacity.</p>
<p>Still, since there are so many new female designers in comparison with males, there should still be more women getting new jobs than men, even if you factor in possible career and life choices.</p>

<p>My intention is not to protect anyone, Lady or Gentleman, from harsh discussions. I have worked in both all-men and all-women environments, and I must say, neither is an advantage. Reading some of the forums/threads on Typophile, I recognise the &ldquo;male&rdquo; patterns. These discussions evolve in a direction of who&rsquo;s right and who&rsquo;s wrong, and that&rsquo;s not very interesting, if you ask me.</p>
<p>Saying this, I find most discussions here very interesting. And I can not point to specific threads, this is just a general notion.</p>

<p>So women prefer being covertly derisive?  :-)</p>

<p>In my type design class, 5 out of 7 students are women. And I actually think that&rsquo;s typical of graphic design as a whole these days. On the other hand, while the women seem to go on to become professional graphic designers, they don&rsquo;t do the same with type design. My explanation is that women have more sense.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe it has something to do with the perceived technical nature of type design? I double-majored as an undergraduate, getting degrees in both English Lit and Physics simultaneously (though I work as a designer these days). My English classes were 70% female, while my Physics classes were 70% male (at a university that was circa 60% female overall). I had a chance to observe the stereotypes that members of each discipline held for the other. Male physicists often characterized literary criticism as a wishy-washy field, lacking any real rigor or organization. But the lit girls thought physics was all about crunching numbers and complicated math, stuff that was basically meaningless to their lives. They assumed physics was inaccessible, even though they&rsquo;d never really been exposed to it. When a field seems innately technical, it generally appeals better to men; when it seems organic or humanistic, it generally attracts more women. At least, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve observed.</div>

<p>I&rsquo;m not complaining that there aren&rsquo;t any woman around, I know there are. I was just wondering if they are underrepresented in this forum. If so, it could mean that a disproportionate amount of female graphic/type designers are excluded from the networking going on this website.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>such a fascinating thread&hellip;.I go to undergrad design school and this is a constant topic of discussion as the ration of women to men is often 15-17:1 as a single class may often have just one male in it, some none at all. In any case, that seems to be the general rule about design schools as of late.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what that means—perhaps the scales will swing drastically within the next decade—perhaps not. At the same time, what does it matter?</p>
<p>I find that gender is much more of a broad gradient than it is a black and white definition. Anyway, it&rsquo;s all about categorization of body shapes and generalizations that don&rsquo;t really have anything to do with those letters that we fiddle with all day&hellip;.right</p>

I don&rsquo;t agree with the age thing. Age in graphic design means experience and good solid education. I see lots of kids with talent nowadays that are just worried about what&rsquo;s trendy now and are just producing ephemerous work (oh jeeesss&hellip;where are you george? I don&rsquo;t know how to spell ephemerous in English&hellip;) stuff you look at and forget about it after 5 secs. I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary to know how to use the latest technology if you are creative enough. I mean, obviously if you can&rsquo;t cope with the technology developments, you are missing a lot of things&hellip;type design for example?</div>

<p>Wow&hellip; thanks for the off-handed compliment.
But age can produce wine, vinegar and very stinky cheese!</p>
<p>As for women in type design, the ones you learn about are the ones that outclassed many of the males. The same holds true for art. Very few males are still willing to admit that Mary Cassatt was a &ldquo;better&rdquo; painter than most of the Impressionists, and that Georgia O&rsquo;Keefe was in a class by herself.</p>

<p>Back in the &rsquo;50s the only (times have changed) Mexican girl in our So. Cal. school was Nadine. If she drank out of a certain faucet, no one else could use that faucet for the rest of the day, or they got the cooties too. This type of behavior went on for the entire year. I wish I could see that she wasn&rsquo;t emotionally scarred for life.</p>

btw Lore the word you are looking for, I think, is ephemeral and the point you make about it is sadly true.</div>

<p>Please tell me you are kidding? That is what puts it in context. Simply for being Mexican we emotionally tortured a girl. I only spoke out about it because I had just been wondering about her Sat. But I feel bad about it. I am married to a Mexican citizen.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t jump to conclusions about you, but a big problem in today&rsquo;s society is how quickly so many people get offended. Unless someone is urinating on some Christian icon, of course. Then it is free speech.</p>
<p>I bare my soul, and someone nit-picks. This week isn&rsquo;t starting out good. I&rsquo;ll hope things get better at the office.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A &ldquo;Cootie&rdquo; is something invented by young children in elementary schools years ago.  It is some sort of an evil ficticious bug creature that can infest you.  Children can be cruel so at times, they would hurl the biggest insult that they could muster at someone they disliked or were jealous of.  That remark was &ldquo;You have Cooties&rdquo;!. At which point a chorus of &ldquo;Ehhuuuuuu!!!&rdquo; would chime in by the rest of the 3rd graders in earshot.
Since at that age boys and girls are &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; (until puberty strikes), the Cooties insult was often blasted at members of the opposite sex.</p>

<p>I also remember the board game, shown above dated 1949, so it must have been used as an expression many years before that.</p>
