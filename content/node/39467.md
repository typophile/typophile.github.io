  would not use because of some association with something that has nothing to do
  with it's graphic qualities? And I don't meant simply because you think it is over
  used or dated... Maybe it was designed by your X's mother in law, or a wing-nut
  in an aluminum foil hat and you don't condone that sort of thing... What ever. It
  has nothing to do with the typeface itself.\r\n\r\nI've found the recent spate of
  threads about bashing typefaces a little puzzling and difficult to take seriously.
  If you don't like a typeface don't use it. It's just a typeface. (And it was probably
  designed by a regular here... )\r\nDavid's comments about Futura interesting, and
  I agree, but I would have described it differently.\r\n\r\n"

    think types are versatile/independent graphics... i can't remember a typeface
    doomed to be forever associated with particular events or people, and i think
    this is how it should be. I cannot embed my feelings in to it, we should instead
    \"exercise\" it, free them from that (this for a non private design of course).
