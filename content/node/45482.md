  faux old-book; complete with a faux marbling job done with screenprinting.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/detail_3600.sm.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  designed this from afar and the good folks at Objective Press Canada published -
  well really - made this with their own hands. It uses P22's - LTF Calson Pro Long.\r\n\r\nSee

  thanks for the photos!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Sharon, Andre.\r\n\r\nIt has no spine as such because it has no binding
    other than 3 bolts. So in some ways it's quite a misleading object - but hopefully
    in a fun way."
