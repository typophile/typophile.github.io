  figured I'd be better off if I turn to you guys for advice. Here's the thought process
  I have been through so far with picking fonts for an upcoming magazine design:\r\n\r\nI
  have been looking at a magazine where they have (in my opinion) beautifully combined
  lineto's Replica and what I think is Matthew Carter's Miller. Because of budgeting
  limitations, I started out thinking I could maybe try to replace Miller with Adobe
  Caslon. That's the first question, I guess: What do you guys think of such a replacement?\r\n\r\nThen
  I started looking at Replica versus Schwartz\u2019s Graphik. I want a sans-serif
  I can use both for headings and for body text. Would Graphik work for that? And
  would it combine with Caslon, or is this just outrageous?"

    options if there is no size-specific (optically scaled) display version available.

    will also use the sans-serif for body text. And then other places I will use the
    serif for body text.\r\n\r\nYou're suggesting, Nick, that if I want to use the
    serif for headlines, then Miller will give me more design options than Caslon,
    right?"

  body: Adobe Caslon, certainly. But there are many other Caslons, several of which
    have display cuts.

    different weights for the sans you can also try the rather inexpensive [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/neuzeits/|Neuzeit
