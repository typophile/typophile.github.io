    only the top half of the word.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hey Tim, I think you might be right, but could you say a bit more about the
    strategy of kerning WRT the top half?  I think I understand what you are saying
    in this case, but I am not sure I get how the overall balance relies more heavily
    on the top half.  Part of what I was struggling with in this design is that it
    first seemed like a tighter spacing was possible, but going looser overall really
    has helped overcome some of the particularly difficult areas.  Still tweaking
    by tiny bits!  Thanks for the help!

  body: "When people read, they actually only read the top half of words. So in order
    for your logotype to be as legible as possible you should have a nice rhythm (optical
    spacing) between the top half of your letters.\r\n\r\nIt's a trick I learnt from
    watching Doyald Young's documentary, and it has worked pretty good for me.\r\n\r\nEvery
    type lover should see this documentary and therefore I have posted it on my blog:
    http://brandsandtypography.blogspot.com/2011/12/tweede-bericht.html\r\n\r\nGreat
    inspiration!"

  body: "The looser the spacing the more space you have to optically align letters.
    That's a given.\r\n\r\nBut I think in this case the looser spacing also fits the
    brand better."

  body: Yea I am happy with the looser spacing.  I have seen the documentary, and
    I do know about the tops of the letters being critical to reading.  I always assumed
    that reading the tops was mostly a lowercase thing.  But I think you are right
    about rhythm.  I probably was focusing too much on trying to achieve even color
    and equal volume between letters.  Anyhow, thanks for the help, I do feel this
    has improved greatly thanks to all your feedback!  Thank you!

    about the subject?\r\n\r\nAnyway I like the outcome. The leaven symbol is also
    great!\r\n"

  body: Nice logo!  Yet, I believe there's still just a little too much space between
    the AV. (At first glance, the LEA and VEN rather look as though they're separate
    sections.)
