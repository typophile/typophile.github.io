  body: "My answers to these questions:\r\n\r\n1. Marketing, the ability to sell and
    brand yourself.\r\n\r\n2. Check the market first. I know a lot more experienced
    designers who are able to freelance, than ones fresh out of design school. Freelancing
    \ for a living seems to be harder to do these days.\r\n\r\n3. Yes and No. Yes
    if you (or your parents) can afford it, no if you can't. Personally, I think unpaid
    internships are a travesty and should be extinct. What they say is \"we only want
    people who come from a certain tax bracket\" or \"your work is so valued that
    you deserve to NOT be paid.\" In competitive cities like New York and San Francisco,
    unpaid internships are not feasible for independently funded individuals considering
    the high cost of living. Only while you're in college.\r\n\r\n4. 10 months\r\n\r\n5.
    Being yourself. I've been to enough AIGA events to see the numerous smarmy, sleazy
    design hipsters who don't give a flying fuck about anything the person they're
    talking to is saying...just their name and clout. While I believe it is \"who
    you know,\" who you know should not be relegated to a select list of buzzworthy
    names you can drop in conversation. Who you know could be the guy you used to
    sit next to in Color Theory class who just started his own company. Take NO ONE
    for granted, there's something special or interesting about EVERYONE. "

    well.\r\n\r\nFreelancing is tough even if you have a solid portfolio and lots
    of contacts. I'm not sure it's a great idea for someone fresh out of school. My
    advice is to get a job that isn't going to bust your balls and try to build up
    a freelance clientele on the side so that in a few years when you are ready to
    strike out on your own you already have the connections to hit the ground running. "

  body: "1. The ability to help clients from the ground up by clarifying their message
    before design starts. I freelance in nonprofit precisely because my clients are
    open to basic communications planning with me.\r\n2. You never start as a freelancer;
    start with a studio that gives you access to a nice mix of clients who will follow
    you later. Or, like me, work in-house for a good nonprofit and then use that background
    to spin off. Staff first, freelance later.\r\n3. You only intern for free while
    in school, never after. Avoid the plentiful free-for-exposure come-ons; they're
    all BS.\r\n4. You canvas the market while training, so you're ready to pounce
    and get the job right after. Sometimes your design teachers will hire or refer
    you to those hiring.\r\n5. Any way you can meet potential clients face to face
    will serve the networking goal. How depends on your location and the market.\r\n"

    with clients that change their mind all the time (I don't think there's any way
    to prevent this, if there is please someone let me know...). Basically: a lot
    of patience!\r\nb) Good organisational skills: a methodical approach that allows
    you to respect deadlines and deal with administration and financial stuff yourself.\r\nc)
    obviously good marketing skills (but I think this is included in \"being a good
    designer\"!\r\n\r\nQuestion 2: Freelance straight after graduation is not a great
    idea. This is something you do when you are a little bit more experienced and
    \"streetwise\". If you do it, make sure you have some kind of support and that
    you're not completely on your own. \r\n\r\nQuestion 3: Unless it's for charity
    or for a cause you support I don't see any reason for doing it. I guess it's ok
    if the job you do for free gives you exposure or any other benefit (awards, etc.)
    \r\n\r\nQuestion 4: Usually it also depends on <cite>how</cite> you graduate.
    Degree show, D&AD New Blood etc. can do great things for you. Difficult to say
    because I was working as designer before I decided to get a degree (shame on me...)
    but I guess I could do little jobs immediately after graduating and I was never
    short of things to do (but that included copywriting,etc.) I'm still waiting for
    the big jobs though!\r\n\r\nQuestion 5: I guess it depends on where you are (also

  body: "Hi Hayley. \r\n\r\nThere are some very good answers here already. I think
    you can gather a consensus of opinion about the value of working for free, and/or
    doing internships. As someone who recently organised a graduate internship, I
    think it's fair to say that payment issues need to be addressed at the outset.\r\n\r\nWhat
    are your other (remaining) questions? For the five you posted, here's my tuppence
    worth;\r\n\r\n<em>Question 1: Apart from being a good designer what other skills
    do you think a good freelancers needs to have?</em> Sense of humour. Communication
    skills*.\r\n\r\n<em>Question 2: What is the one piece of advice you would give
    to a graduate wanting to become a freelancer?</em> Don't do it. Work for someone
    else first.\r\n\r\n<em>Question 3: Would you advise working for free when starting
    out?</em> Freebies are for family and friends only. \r\n\r\n<em>Question 4: After
    graduating how long did it take you to get regular work?</em> 2 months holiday
    then straight to work. It wasn't a graphic design job \u2013 it was the first
    job I could find.\r\n\r\n<em>Question 5: What do you think is the best way to
    network?</em>By doing this assignment on a face-to-face basis rather than online.
    \r\n\r\n*In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the assignment question is designed
    to force you to network and practise some peer-to-peer communication; typophile
    and deviantart are great, but they're not appropriate for what the question requires...
    so pick up your phone directory and start speaking to local designers."

  body: "Hello Hayley,\r\nIt is nice to meet a fellow deviant here. :-) I will do
    my best to answere your questions. \r\n\r\nQuestion 1: Apart from being a good
    designer what other skills do you \r\nthink a good freelancers needs to have?\r\n\r\nanswer:
    Your client will not pay you because how skilled you are, He will pay you only
    because you can do the job. Based on that fact I would say you have to be able
    to know what your client need exactly. \r\n\r\nQuestion 2: What is the one piece
    of advice you would give to a graduate wanting to become a freelancer?\r\n\r\nanswer:
    Make a long term plan, like what will you be within 5 years. Know what kind of
    client you can work for, and what type of design are you going to provide ( web/
    print/ illustrations ) - because one of my problems at my start that I first went
    to wrong clients. Have also your own website and learn how to show your portoflio
    over there.\r\n\r\nQuestion 3: Would you advise working for free when starting
    out?\r\n\r\nanswer: It can be happen; to build a portoflio. \r\n\r\nQuestion 4:
    After graduating how long did it take you to get regular work?\r\nanswer: few
    months. It was very hard perioud of my life.\r\n\r\nQuestion 5: What do you think
    is the best way to network?\r\n\r\nanswer: If you know the kind of client you
    prefer to work with, you ofcours know how to find them. It is important to put
    your self in their place: How do you want your designer to deal with you. \r\n\r\nAnd
    above all I have to say the end of freelancing story will be when you make your
    own office, so start to design your logotype now :-)\r\n\r\nAhmad Shawkash"

    yourself nobody is going to be telling you how to manage your time. You need to
    be able to do that successfully or else you'll find yourself in your pajamas at
    4pm realizing you've just spent 3 hours on You Tube and the job no closer to finished.
    \r\n\r\nI also recommend you find a productive way to spend your down time, because
    you will have down time and as above, don't want to end up noodling on the internet
    all day. I'm a painter and that is an excellent motivation to get my work done
    - so I can get to my studio."
