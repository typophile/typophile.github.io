    it has quite a nice eighties/&#34;cock rock&#34; feel to it. Simple and square.
    Erm, which means I could easily do the letters I need myself... Right.  <BR> <BR>The
    second one is a bit trickier to imitate though ;&#41; Isn&#39;t there any font
    I could use &#40;and carve up if needs be&#41; to get similar letters?'

    target="_blank">Bureau Agency</a> and skew it. <BR> <BR>And add the umlauts for
    authenticity...
