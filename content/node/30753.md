  integrate a corporate font (of Chapparal & Myriad) with web based typefaces\u2026
  Not sure where to start\u2026 whether its looking into whats common across most
  computers, or finding a way to cross utilize text with flash, etc. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nFor
  the ranking side of things, spiders cant read any flash what so ever? Thoughts,
  comments?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJames\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Here CSS might be your friend. You can have text which will display only if
    the picture cannot load (I'm thinking of some of the treatments at the CSS Zen
    Garden) which will allow you to use corporate font identities for headers, at
    very least.

    \"\r\n\r\nSEM?\r\n\r\nThere's many reasons why HTML has benefits:\r\n\r\n - device
    independant\r\n - when done right, completely accessible to a wide range of people\r\n
    - can be a good way to single-source content\r\n - computer readable (SEO)\r\n
    - easier to share\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to deal with custom faces is to just
    make them images. Obviously, this should only be done for display face uses (headlines,
    titles, etc.) but works just fine when accompanied with the appropriate alt attributes.\r\n\r\nYou
    can also use sIFR...which this site uses...to create the headline type as flash.
    Alas, it has it's problems. (For instance, for whatever reason, none of the thread
    TITLES in Flash show up for me on this site when using Firefox).\r\n"
