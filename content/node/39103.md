  it in?\r\n\r\nI know there are a bunch of type libraries and collections out there,
  but they all seem to contain many not so useful typefaces along side the great ones.
  Is there a specific collection you would recommend? One that would be a great basis
  to build upon? You know how it is. I want to get the best bang for my buck! \r\n\r\nI
  have seen the list of essentials on here, and that is great, but I am interested
  in a concise list of bare necessities for under $1000.\r\n\r\nI can't wait to see
  your suggestions! I think it would be very helpful for many who are starting a library."

  body: This really depends on what type of work you're doing. I would recommend you
    spend 3/4 of your budget on "workhorse" sans and serif families, and get a few
    script and display faces as well. There are a lot of good suggestions on the lists
    posted above. I would encourage you to really think about usage, and to look carefully
    before purchasing. I've bought more than a few type families that I just couldn't
    resist, that have yet to be used.

    it's useless to pick fonts without a use. \r\nI think you need to start with your

  body: "Thanks so much for your advice. I really like the idea of approaching a foundry
    with a budget and asking them assist in putting together some workhorse typefaces\u2014and
    in the process begin a relationship with them. I hadn't thought of that. \r\n\r\nI
    appreciate the top 20 lists very much too. Although I notice that that many of
    the lists seem to come with caveats like 'these are workhorses, but most experienced
    designers end up using 5-6 faces over and over and get to know them really well'.
    Hmmm, this provokes the question 'What are your five or six favourites that designers
    keep coming back to? The typefaces you use that are not the classics or the workhorses?
    The faces that reoccur in the projects you love?\r\n\r\nI increasingly recognize
    that perhaps my approach is flawed and am reconsidering. But am interested in
    learning of others' favourites as possibilities to consider in the future when
    approaching particular projects. It sounds like a slow building process may be
    more desirable than a blanket expenditure. Thanks for invaluable input!"

    a new family each time you have a real need for one; considering at each purchase
    how useful the family will be in the future. As your collection grows, one hopes
    it will all be useful, carefully-chosen designs that are versatile and varied.
    \r\n\r\nI think it's essential for graphic designers to have budget for fonts
    all the time. Don't think you can buy a CD and be done with it for 20 years; nobody
    likes that stale look.\r\n\r\nIf it's more important that you decide right away
    and blow the $1000, then it doesn't matter which CD you choose. Any time you get
    bulk type libraries, you get stuff you can't use. The least fluffy library CDs
    I can think of are from Storm and FontBureau. But there will always be faces from
    indies like House, Underware, OurType, Joshua Darden, Simonson, that you really
    want....\r\n\r\nGet them a few at a time, and savor them...."

  body: Speaking from my own experience in building up a type library over the years,
    I also recommend doing it gradually, on an as-need basis dictated by the projects
    you work on, and carefully considering each purchase as to both current and future
    needs. It's tempting to buy typefaces you really like, especially if they're on
    sale. I've done this occasionally when I could reasonably foresee a need for a
    particular font that was on sale; but it can wreak havoc with your budget if you
    give in too often.

    music. What if you subscribed to a font service and every month you got to download
    a certain number of typefaces.\r\n\r\nIt would encourage designers/firms to keep
    a their type library fresh and spread the cost out over the year and build it
    into their budgets a bit easier. It would benefit the foundry as they could offer
    the faces at perhaps a slightly lower cost, but retain a more consistent and longer
    term revenue stream.\r\n\r\nJust a thought.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I recall some years back a foundry promoting an offer whereby you paid them,
    say, $1000 now, and used this as your "bank" to draw typefaces from their collection.
    I think the incentive was, you got the fonts for much less than the regular price.
    Drawback, of course, was that the money was all tied up with that foundry, and
    what if it went belly-up before you had got your full value of fonts.

    It prevents you from buying typefaces now you end up not using later, but also
    gives you a little more freedom when you are working on a project; you don't have
    to choose from your library, the choice is less limited.

    need Clarendon. You can do a lot with a little, at least to start."

    current web at\r\n\r\nwww.stormtype.com\r\n\r\nI use their complete library in
    the \"single license\" form, allowing installation on one computer only. This
    saves about 50% of the price of the standard license allowing 5 installations.\r\n\r\nSome
    of the choices I would consider for you are these:\r\n\r\n* Storm Open Library
    2 - ca. $700, 12 font families very well usable for serious work\r\n* JBW+ (Jannon-Baskerville-Walbaum)
    for ca. $500 - 3 large families for book typography\r\n* Designer Set for ca.
    $960 - bigger collection of mostly less usable, but not bad fonts\r\n\r\nbut I
    still find unbeatable the value/price compromise of their actual complete library
    of some 700 fonts - single license for ca. $2000. This contains all the serious
    fonts they've ever produced. You can probably survive a couple of years with just
    this library.\r\n\r\nThere is also (for some) an interesting side offer - Storm
    Type Library 2 TTF single license for ca. $600 - this contains all fonts the foundry
    has produced till 2005, but only in TTF format without the OpenType gimmicks,
    what is probably too limiting for a professional.\r\n\r\nIt might be good to ask
    them about Celebration Font Set (produced 2005, not advertised on their international
    web, but still available at their Czech web www.pismolijna.cz) if you need Type
    1 fonts, all their newer sets include only OpenType fonts.\r\n\r\nAs I do not
    make my living by typography nor graphic design, I usually hesitate to invest
    too much in fonts. But when I use a font, I need it to be good enough (to have
    various sets of figures, proper small caps, multi-language support [living in
    the EU, I need the support of many european languages] etc.). Currently some 80%
    of fonts I use come from Storm Type as their offers meet the requirements I have.\r\n\r\nPeter
