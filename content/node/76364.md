body: "Hello gals et guys:\r\n\r\nAs of recently I have been acquainting myself with
  persons of the deaf community. There is a real need to have hand sign fonts included
  with the operating system. I would like to know if these glyphs have been added
  to the Unicode repertoire. Windows? Mac OS X?\r\n\r\nAlso, is there any progress
  on adding SignWriting to the Unicode specification and what can be done to speed
  its adoption. (I wonder if Sign Writing is copyrighted so that it cannot be designed
  by other developers)\r\n\r\nI would like understand more of the issue as it relates
  to design & implementation from the perspective of the deaf, hearing, operating
  system and application programmers.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

  body: "No encoding activities known so far. The fish is too big for quick volunteer
    action.\r\nI think the Sutton writing system is not copyrighted. Would make no
    sense. And: would prevent encoding.\r\n\r\nFrom the technical point of view, encoding
    Sign writing is difficult because it groups glyph other than just along a baseline.
    Similar to Old Egyptian.\r\n\r\na publication on the subject:\r\nhttp://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=14\r\n\r\nthe

    License.  All of the glyphs of SignWriting organized in an HTML reference:\r\nhttp://www.signbank.org/iswa
    (view online)\r\nhttp://www.signbank.org/iswa.zip (download)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unicode
    proposal is maturing nicely.  A 2 stage process will be used.  The first will
    encode the glyphs only and will ignore layout design.  Michael Everson has reviewed
    the proposal documents.  He believes he can help write a refined proposal and
    successfully present to the Unicode Consortium.  We're hoping to accomplish this
    in 2011.\r\n\r\nA rough draft of the general Unicode proposal is on my site:\r\nhttp://www.signpuddle.net/mediawiki/index.php/Unicode\r\n\r\nThe
    detailed encoding for each SignWriting symbol is documented:\r\nhttp://signpuddle.net/sw_unicode/\r\n\r\nThe
    second stage will propose characters needed for text layout and collation.  This
    proposal will have to wait until 2012.\r\n\r\nI am currently writing an Internet
    Draft for the ISWA 2010.  This will fully document the standard and include an
    appendix with my practical script encoding model called Binary SignWriting.\r\nhttp://signpuddle.org/draft-slevinski-iswa-2010-00.html\r\nhttp://signpuddle.org/draft-slevinski-iswa-2010-00.txt\r\n\r\nI'm
    currently converting SignPuddle Online from the ISWA 2008 to the ISWA 2010.  Then
    I'll finish the Internet Draft to document the standard.  Then I'll update the
    SignWriting Image Server GPL software:\r\nhttp://www.signbank.org/swis\r\n\r\nSo,
    we're making progress.  Almost off of the bleeding edge."

    to be completed first before we can even think about operating system adoption...
    right?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

  body: "Rather than the operating system level, the font engine level should be possible
    through SIL's Graphite application.  The SignWriting data format works differently
    that other scripts, so it will require a significant investment to implement correctly.
    \ Maybe in a few years.\r\n\r\nApplication level is possible today with the current
    standards.  The script encoding model has been relatively stable for the past
    5 years.  The symbol set has been improved and stabilized.  The character encoding
    model has been optimized for faster processing and smaller size.  All of our user
    generated data can be converted to the latest standards.  I believe the combination
    of the International SignWriting Alphabet 2010 along with Binary SignWriting revision
    3 draft C will be the standard for years to come.\r\n\r\nThe data can be stored
    as PUA Unicode on plane 15 or a custom hex string of equivalent or smaller size.
    \ Here's a hex example of BSW 3C: _0fa_1eb_38d_392_15d_38d_39a_376_38c_392_0fc_79c_7be_2f7_38c_392_78c_7b7_15a_38d_39a_776_77f_1eb_38d_392_782_781_22b_38c_396_78a_797_30a_38c_392_778_753_353_38c_392_778_753\r\n\r\nI'll
    have the standards implemented in my application SignPuddle before the end of
    this year.  I'll have the standards fully documented and ready for early adopters
    by 2011 Q1."
