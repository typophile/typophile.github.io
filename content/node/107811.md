    condensed faces. This would open-source a standard 4-member family (regular, italic,
    bold, bold italic) from that set. Each font has ~ 580 glyphs, with extensive typographic
    features.\r\n\r\n> It's quite true that designing a new Clarendon from scratch

    pay to commission a new 4-font typeface with that many glyphs, designed from scratch
    by a very competent but not super-famous type designer.\r\n\r\nWe could debate
    about whether we expect a direct revival to be a bit less than an original design,
    but any difference between those rates would be less than the variation between
    type designers in pricing, and hence lost in the noise, IMO."

    Clarendon is included with Linux distributions, for example. If one feels that
    somehow Clarendon is a very basic typeface, which should be routinely used (as
    it once was when most typefaces didn't have boldface versions) then given that
    Helvetica and Palatino have open-source imitations available, but Clarendon doesn't
    could be perceived as a problem.\r\n\r\nMyself, I'd view Century Expanded and
    Schoolbook as higher priority... hmm, though, in my search for a particular open-source

  body: "Given that the project in question does not involve font piracy in any form
    whatever, I find a comment about \"liberating\" people's computers in poor taste.\r\n\r\nIntellectual
    property has value, but it does differ from physical property.\r\n\r\nThus, the
    scene in Atlas Shrugged where an architect whose rights were not respected in
    the building of housing for the poor takes a bulldozer to the construction...
    depicts wasteful behavior which makes the world poorer.\r\n\r\nThe main reason,
    though, that the distinction between intellectual property and physical property
    must be kept in mind is this:\r\n\r\nIntellectual property rights exist because
    they have been granted by the government. They result from a covenant between
    the people of a country and authors, inventors, artists, and so on, to agree to
    give them a limited property right in their creations to encourage them to contribute
    to the benefit of the country and humanity by producing them.\r\n\r\nSo the rights
    given by copyright and patent laws are something society chose to grant, because
    it saw that it would benefit from the bargain.\r\n\r\nRights in physical property,
    on the other hand, are natural law rights. There is no choice in the matter: a
    country that lets some people's property be stolen is engaging in a human rights
    violation.\r\n\r\nWhy is this important?\r\n\r\nBecause when representatives of
    the film industry or the music industry come forwards to legislators asking for
    extensions of the copyright law - either extensions in the term of copyright for
    past works, or laws like the DMCA - the legislators need to clearly understand
    that they are not under any moral obligation to grant such requests, and instead
    should only do so if there is a net benefit to society as a whole, not content
    owners."

    want amateur designers to abuse more quality typefaces? No, I rather keep the
    better choices for myself. Not that I remember ever using Clarendon before though.
    Which, to me personally makes it even less relevant to liberate Clarendon.\r\n\r\nIf
    I can help it I would like to limit the amount of typefaces amateur designers
    have access to to a minimum. Let them first learn how to use type properly before
    advancing to other typefaces. I'm aware I'm being callous, egocentric and perhaps
    a tad narrow-minded, but I simply tire too much from typefaces used incorrectly
    and becoming stigmatized because people who know nothing about type have opinions
    based on those incorrect uses. Keep Clarendon reserved for people who understand
    type. Let the amateurs chew on Helvetica for another 40 years."

  body: "<blockquote>Please check your facts.\r\nAll property rights are created by
    law. No laws, no property rights.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAh, no. Once you allow separating
    \"right\" from \"law\" in any context, as is done with basing a society on \"inalienable
    rights,\" you remove the fact-checking option. There is no one-to-one correlation
    between  \"legal\" and \"true,\" and \"true\" is needed for \"fact,\" minimally
    as  matter of language. \r\n\r\nAll religious truths are \"revealed,\" rather
    than \"discovered\" or \"proven.\" To deny a religious truth simply means that
    particular truth hasn't been revealed to you. Counterarguments from science, or
    another religion, count for nothing to the holder of that truth. That's the source
    for both the strength and weakness of religious truths, and why it can get downright
    messy, in a law-based society, deciding as a matter of law just what is a religion
    and what isn't.\r\n\r\nAt their core, all satisfactory explanatory systems are
    based on faith, either you accept the system or not. Mixing explanatory systems
    midstream is convenient but correctly opens you up to a charge of inconsistency.
    \r\n\r\nNor can you use the tenant of a system to prove it's \"truth.\" Using
    \"because it works\" can be a reason, practical or otherwise, for someone to adopt
    an explanatory system, but is not evidence for it, not an argument for or proof
    of it's truth.\r\n\r\nExample: empiricism (encompasses science) is so complete
    it can explain why someone becomes a mystic. But a system based on mysticism can
    be just as complete and can explain why someone becomes a scientist (Plato, for
    one, does).\r\n\r\nOnce you allow inalienable rights, you need to decry quadibloc
    on moral rather than logical grounds. Alternative is to give up on \"inalienable
    rights.\" "

    rights are created by law. No laws, no property rights.</cite>\r\n\r\nI have to
    admit this is more of a matter of opinion than of fact at this time.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it is a fact that governments do exist, and have existed, other than democratically-elected
    governments.\r\n\r\nThus, some governments have failed to respect basic human
    rights. They have done things that were cruel and unfair to innocent people. Both
    the Holocaust and Negro slavery are facts of history.\r\n\r\nThus, to make it
    intelligible that we can criticize governments from a moral point of view, it
    is necessary to adopt a view such as we see written in the Declaration of Independence:
    that it is inherently obvious that all human beings are equal in terms of their
    rights, these rights are not given to them by any government or human authority,
    but are either a logical consequence of their inherent nature, or, if endowed,
    are endowed by no less an authority than God Himself, and these rights cannot
    be bartered or sold, and they include the rights of life (including bodily integrity
    and security of person), freedom, and the ability to pursue one's goals in one's
    own way subject to respecting the rights of others (including the right to the
    property one has legitimately earned, freedom of religion, and so on).\r\n\r\nFor
    it is written, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
    equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
    that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\"."
