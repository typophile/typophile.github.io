  free commercial fonts. That is not my purpose in this post. I feel like the best
  of fonts are less tools and more works of art (and thus, I feel like those who work
  on them should absolutely be compensated).\r\n\r\nMy purpose in posting is to ask
  if there is any good site for free and open-source fonts (and possibly WebFont supported).
  I've done quite a bit of web design, and having access to good WebFonts would be
  wonderful. Plus, there are several Open-source typefaces that I prefer over their
  proprietary counterparts (i.e. Deja Vu Serif and Liberation Serif are infinitely
  better than Times New Roman).\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm not asking for any Commercial typefaces,
  I'm asking for a good place to find fonts that were designed with the intent of
  being free to use for everyone and anyone that wants.\r\n\r\nAny help and all suggestions
  are greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n-Sam"

    they're actually Open-source, or if they're just licensed for commercial use without
    pay. I'm looking into it though.\r\n\r\nSome of the ones (even on the home page)
    are quite excellent. Thank you again!\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?"

    say you have it all backwards. Works of art are not ment to be used. I suppose
    you could cover a hole in the wall with a picture, but if that is your purpose,
    you don't need a high-dollar painting.\r\n\r\nAny use of type tends to make it
    look worse than a carefully crafted specimen sheet. After you set that specimen,
    it's all downhill.\r\n\r\nThere is a notion that artists do their thing for the
    joy of it, not for the money. Usually not true of craftsmen."

    What gives?\r\n\r\nI love doing open source work. The thankful emails I get every
    day are more than enough to keep me going. But I would starve if I didn't get
    paid for it.\r\n\r\nFull-time type designers, be honest. Money isn't just some
    symbolic hat taken off to your artistic skills*; it's your breakfast. No breakfast,
    no more fonts. Unless you've already made your million, which would legitimize
    this controversy.\r\n\r\n* or craftsmanship, whatever."

    I mentioned, but my point was just that  \"works of art\" covers a broad range
    of items, some of which are actually used in everyday life.\r\n\r\nThe Museum
    of Modern Art in New York, for example, has displayed items as diverse as furniture,
    computers, jewelry, even kitchen utensils."

    just meant to say that typefaces are one of the few digital creations that I feel

    for all digital work to one day be open-source).\r\n\r\nAs for the \"works of

    is that of functional art. A true work of art still mean to be used. This is how
