body: Hello <BR> <BR>I&#39;m in grad school and I&#39;m doing a project which is a
  movie poster for an invented mid-1960s secret agent / space travel and alien invasion
  movie &#40;inspired by the old Gerry Anderson British tv show &#34;UFO&#34;&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>Does anyone have suggestions for an appropriate type face for the title?
  I want something that evokes a 60s version of the future, with an element of swinging
  groove to it -- but not psychedelic or hippy-ish. <BR> <BR>I was thinking about
  Typeco&#39;s Glyphic Neue &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeco/glyphic-neue/"
  target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeco/glyphic-neue/</a>&#41; <BR>and
  also Pump &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pump-2/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pump-2/</a>&#41;
  <BR>which I like but it may be a little too 1970s / disco-ish. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts?
  <BR> <BR>Thanks.
