  gem of a type site:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.daidala.com\r\n\r\nIt's always nice to see
  non-Latin coverage, but I have to strongly disagree with Coltz's assessment that
  Romulus Greek is a good design; on a formal Latin level it's great, but in terms
  of actual use (you know, like a font is made to be used...) it's like a transvestite
  shackled to Jabba the Hutt - ask any Greek (who is a Star Wars fan).\r\n\r\nBut
  if Romulus Greek was the abyss, the fonts from the 70s he mentions were the sides
  of the cliff. [[Matthew Carter]] -who was paid to make them like that by his Greek
  clients- himself had an allergic reaction to their inauthenticity, and made his
  [[Cadmus]] font.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Greek type design has become its own person
  in the last decade or so. Hopefully other non-Latin scripts can learn from its mistakes
  and successes.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I don't mean to sound so negative; Coltz's piece is
  otherwise very timely and informative.\r\n\r\nhhp"
