  in Fontlab when trying to save my font as OpenType. Actually today is the first
  time i ever had this attention window popping up every time I'm trying to save it
  and to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nhere's the message i keep getting:\r\n\r\n\"Current
  font contains both OpenType features definition and imported binary OpenType tables.Whitch
  data you want to use while generating OpenType\r\n\r\n(then theres 2 options) \"Binary\"
  or \"Compiled\"\r\n\r\nwhat exactly do they mean here by this and how come i never
  had this message before but now i do...should i pick Binary or Compiled?\r\n\r\nreally
  hope someone finds some time to help me understand this a little better.\r\n\r\nthnx
  very much everyone"

    wasn't getting this message before...to my knowledge i haven't changed or imported

    for binary or compiled...whats the safest way to save the font and make sure all
    OT features work?"

    I am not sure, what would happen, if you change anything in the kerning, because
    the kern feature is stored in the GPOS table, while the glyph substitution features
    are stored in the GSUB table.\r\n\r\nI assume, that this also was answered before.
    Either on Typophile or on the Fontlab forum."

    What would you do?\r\n\r\nThe substitution features \u2013 do they make use from

    Isn\u2019t this a dilemma? Maybe <em>dilemma</em> is the wrong term. You have
    to decide between two options and both of them are a risk. So a general recommendation
    can not be given with regard to Evie\u2019s question. It is dependent from the
    complexity of the features and from the compiler/decompiler module. Fontlab still
    uses an old version of the module. What is the name of the module by the way?
    It is also part of the AFDKO, isn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\n<cite>Otherwise you may get

    I have decompiled the GSUB table of a font with TTX now. There you find lines

    in=\"cent\" out=\"cent.superior\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;Substitution in=\"comma\" out=\"comma.superior\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;Substitution

    I am not sure, what you meant with \u201Cindex\u201D, because the glyphs seem
    to be substituted with the help of their names, but not with the help of numbers.
    \u201CI am not sure\u201D does not mean, that I know it better. So please don\u2019t

  body: "@ Karsten\r\n\r\nI have experimented a bit with TTX 2.2 (contained in the
    AFDKO 2.5 21898) and FLS 5.0.4.\r\n\r\n1. Reset the options of FLS to default.\r\n\r\n2.
    Open MinionPro and generate MinionPro-FLS-compiled. Choose the compile option,
    when you are asked.\r\n\r\n3. Change to the index mode and substitute a and b.
    Generate MinionPro-abSubstituted-FLS-compiled.\r\n\r\n4. Decompile both files
    with TTX.\r\n\r\n5. Compare the files. You will find changes in three tables (except
    from the table, in which the checksum is stored): GlyphOrder, GPOS and GSUB.\r\n\r\n6.
    Now I have played a bit around. If you decompile the original Minion and substitute
    a and b in the GlyphOrder table only, you will either get an invalid font or the
    order will be reset, dependent from the way, in which you recompile the font.
    (Decompile the GlyphOrder table only, substitute a and b and merge the GlyphOrder
    table into the original font file; or decompile all tables, substitute a and b
    in the GlyphOrder table and recompile the font.) But forget this for a moment.\r\n\r\nIf
    you substitute a and b in the GlyphOrder <strong>and</strong> the GPOS table,
    the recompiled font works. And although the positions of a and b have changed
    \u2013 check it in FontLab or decompile the GlyphOrder and the GPOS table of the
    compiled font again \u2013, the small capital feature seems to work correctly
    in Indesign. \"a\" is substituted by \"a.sc\" and \"b\" by \"b.sc\".\r\n\r\nDo
    you have any explanations for this behavior?\r\n\r\nIt seems to indicate, that
    the GSUB table is independent from the GlyphOrder and the GPOS table. May it be,
    that the GSUB table uses its own (internal) glyph order/index?\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nI
    have forgotten to write in the beginning, that the binary/compile option is obsolete,
    if you change the glyph order in FontLab, because FontLab deletes the stored binary
    layout tables in this case."

    I will try to compare the hexdata. I can merge in fantasy tables with TTX. I could,
    for example, merge in a Kars(ten)-table, that contains a hexdata encoded short
    novel. Maybe it also is possible to merge in the hexdata of a GSUB table. You
    know the merge in option of TTX, don\u2019t you? The parameter is \"-m\". In my
    post from 28/11 I quoted a few decompiled lines and made a logical mistake. My

    same logical mistake again."

    I am unable to find the GPOS table in the hexdata, I cannot search for changes
    in the compiled GPOS table. By the way you cannot merge in hexdata of tables,
    that are officially specificated, except from those tables, that TTX stores as
    hexdata, when it decompiles them, the DSIG table for example. Fantasy tables like
    the KARS(TEN) table can be merged in only, if you put a hexdata tag with a bit
    hexdata into the KARS(TEN) tag.\r\n\r\nBut it is nice to see, that you can preserve
    the features by merging the GSUB table into the font, in which you have changed
    the GLYPH order."
