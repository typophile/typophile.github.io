<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I just came up with a special pangram for election time. I challenge anyone who is interested to set the following text in the typeface or faces of their choice and post a PNG or GIF on this thread. The idea is to see which font is best suited for election time prattle. You can go serious if you like but I am hoping for comic relief from the way-too-long barrage of campaign rhetoric that we have been suffering through this year.
Keep the width of the file to less than 575 pixels to avoid scrolling please.
Here is the text:
"Awakened voters quip, botched president big sleazy jerk--fix him!"

PS: So as not to leave you hanging, the judges will all be Florida voters over the age of 80 who are named Chad. :-)</div>

"Waiting On The World To Change"
by John Mayer
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want
That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care,
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
And we're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change</div>
