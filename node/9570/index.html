  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey all. So I&#39;m finally getting down to making some type instead of thinking and talking about it. My first experiment is on a &#40;sorry in advance&#41; handwriting font to match up with one of my clients&#39; corporate face. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m running the Scanfont/TypeTool combo &#40;sorry, I won&#39;t be upping the ante to FontLab until I get my sorry &#149;&#149;&#149; up to OSX&#41;. <BR> <BR>The specific problem I&#39;m encountering now is that the screen version of the font looks quite terrible. For the most part this doesn&#39;t bother me as it&#39;s printing alright. But I&#39;m thinking if I get around to letting this face into the world then I should do what I can to make it more usable for folks. <BR> <BR>What is it that I need to learn to make a font display sort of ok on screen?  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance, free beer in Vermont, Hello Hrant, <BR> <BR>g <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Gahlord - you&#39;re alive!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Assuming you&#39;re not going to upgarde to FontLab &#40;which may be able to auto-hint your font satisfactorily - but maybe not, since it&#39;s handwriting&#41;, you have four choices: <BR>1&#41; Hint it manually using Fog. This is the normal practice for high-end fonts, but mucho work, plus Fog&#39;s hinting is half-baked. <BR>2&#41; Edit the GASP Table so that it renders anti-aliased at all sizes, so that the lack of hinting doesn&#39;t matter. Problems: you&#39;ll need special software &#40;although VTT is free&#41;; and it assumes the font will be used on an operating system that has smoothing enabled. <BR>3&#41; Edit bitmaps. This isn&#39;t as bad as some people will have you believe, although it&#39;s too much work if you have to do too many point sizes, plus some OSes won&#39;t support it. <BR>4&#41; Leave it as is and tell the client they can&#39;t afford the real thing. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The GASP table is something in a TT font that tells the screen renderer at what PPEM &#40;screen point&#41; sizes to use hinting and/or bitmaps. The only no-cost way to edit it that I know of &#40;short of hand-editing binary code&#41; is by using VTT: <BR><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/News.asp?NID=655" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/News.asp?NID=655</a> <BR>What you would do is tell it to ignore hinting at all sizes. <BR> <BR>&#62; What OSes won&#39;t support the hand edited bitmaps?  <BR> <BR>Good question... <BR>I&#39;m behind the times on the Mac side, but I&#39;ve heard that newer MacOSes ignore bitmaps.  :-&#40; <BR> <BR>Insight into this would be really appreciated. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

And I want it to be considered a well made font. It prints as intended, I want people to feel the the computer representation is accurate enough. <BR> <BR>What beginning computer font designers realllllly need is a basic tutorial on the issues. First a big gloss of the main issues, then the nitty gritty...  <BR> <BR>Hrant &#40;since I know you know a lot of this, and I know you&#39;re going to read this&#41;...
