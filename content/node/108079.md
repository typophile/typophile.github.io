  body: I can't help you with this specific one but I know Jorgen tends to use script
    faces like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/so-prolix/">So Prolix</a>
    and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/handsome/">Handsome</a>. Those
    are in a similar style but maybe someone can chime in with the actual typeface.
