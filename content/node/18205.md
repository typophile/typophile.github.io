    InDesign and better fonts (openType) where the ligs should get placed automatically
    for you.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Regarding Sii's comment that OpenType fonts are \"better\"\r\nbecause ligatures
    are placed automatically.\r\n\r\nFonts are inert objects. Ligatures are placed
    by applications\r\nthat use fonts. The only responsibility of a font is to\r\nstore
    enough information so that applications can work\r\nwith ligatures. Type 1 and
    truetype fonts can both store\r\nligatures. In the AFM files of type 1 fonts,
    one can store\r\nadditional information that may help applications with\r\nautomatic
    ligature subsitution and placement of ligatures\r\non the page.  The famous GPOS
    and GSUB tables in OpenType\r\ncan be introduced in truetype fonts as well--there
    is nothing\r\nthat ties these tables umbilically to OpenType.\r\n\r\nSo, how exactly
    are OpenType fonts better?\r\n "

  body: "> InDesign and better fonts \r\n\r\nLuc, nice to see you here again. You
    may have missed my point, I said InDesign <em>and</em> OpenType fonts provide
    an <em>automatic</em> solution. By <EM>better</EM> fonts I meant OpenType fonts
    with more ligatures (mapped using GSUB) than your typical Type 1 font. As opposed
    to <em>same</em> OpenType fonts with the same number of ligs as your typical Type
    1 font. \r\n\r\nTheoretically someone could write a page layout app that would
    do a good job with sets of Type 1 or regular TrueType fonts (perhaps referencing
    an online database mapping the expert sets in some kind of virtual GSUB). But
    is seems like an awful lot of work when OpenType provides all the information
    an app needs.  \r\n\r\nCheers, Si    \r\n"

  body: "\r\nHi Dan-- Wie gehts?\r\n\r\nYou are right that GPOS and GSUB are typical
    tables in\r\nTrueType flavored OpenType fonts. But they can be found\r\nin many
    blue-blooded TrueType fonts as well. These are\r\nmostly for Arabic scripts where
    positioning and replacement\r\nare crucial. \r\n\r\nThanks to google's capability
    of opening binary files such\r\nas TrueType files, you can find examples of such
    fonts by\r\na simple search such as\r\n      filetype:ttf  GSUB\r\n\r\nI do not
