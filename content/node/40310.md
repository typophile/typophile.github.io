  body: Hi Gregers, in case you're interested -- you can find previously identified
    ID request by doing a search and limiting the results to the Typophile.com website,
    like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20lula%20magazine">this</a>.
    As you can see, the Lula magazine display face has been discussed a couple of
    times before. It always helps to do a search first, this saves you some time.
