body: "Hey everybody,\r\n\r\nI'm fourteen years old and I'm designing typefaces in
  TypeTool (You might have seen my expletus in the critique forum). Everywhere I look
  on Typophile I see Fontlab Studio, never TypeTool. I thought (and still think),
  that I can make a complete family in TypeTool, sell it, and actually make some money.
  (Don't worry I'm not expecting much.) TypeTool supports a very broad amount of languages
  (I could easily pass the 1000 glyphs if I wished to). Althoug the TypeTool table
  only has the 'fi' and 'fl' ligatures I found a way that allows me to make all the
  standard ligatures, such as ffj, in TypeTool. TypeTool's drawing tools are simple,
  but I think the quality of my work would go down if I used more automatic functions.
  For example, I make the different weights fully by hand. So my question is: Am I
  a fool to think I can make a succesful typeface in TypeTool? If not, then: How much
  time would I gain by using Fontlab Studio?\r\n\r\nFontlab Studio costs way to much
  for a fourteen year old kid, so if the answer to my first question is 'yes', I might
  as well quit designing typefaces. :-( Any of you font-addicts know that's not really
  an option.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance,\r\n\r\nJasper de Waard\r\n"

    you to concentrate on designing. And it generates OT fonts. Should you really
    need to add OT features, use the free <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/\"
    target=\"_blank\">AFDKO</a>. But do not try to do everything at once. One step
    after the other. It is perhaps a bit early for a 'time gain' question.\r\n\r\nYou
    might consider getting <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/scanfont/\"
    target=\"_blank\">ScanFont</a> or <a href=\"http://www.high-logic.com/scanahand.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Scanahand</a> (Windows only), allowing you to start from your
    own hand-made input rather than playing with outlines alone."

  body: I already have scanfont, but I prefer to copy my sketches by eye in TypeTool.
    I have had a look at the AFDKO, but it seems a bit to complicated for me. It doesn't
    even have a normal installation. Thanks for your comment.

  body: If you design your f properly, you won't need ligatures at all. Ligatures
    are often just an affectation that impairs reading. Consider scaling back the
    scope of your project. You're lacking a decent kerning assistant or kerning classes.
    It's some thing you can overcome but to kern a family or 32 would be too much.
    Don't think you need to release a font all at once. You can start with 1-4 weights
    then expand the family later when your software/skills improve.

  body: I believe your right about the f, but here's the problem. With to many fonts
    on the market many designers don't look at a font if it doesn't have ligatures
    or less than 5 weights. I said "I could easily pass the 1000 glyphs if I wished
    to", which I don't. Don't you think it's worth to be called a typefamily if it
    has 'only' four weights? I don't think I'll ever make more than four weights (8
    styles). To be honest I'm getting sick of this competition to make as many weights
    as possible. Four weights is MORE THAN ENOUGH! I think I'm going to start a new
    topic against this madness. Anybody with me?

  body: "A font with 2 weights is a family. It's not a competition and the number
    of weights doesn't necessarily add up to more sales. Of my current best sellers,
    4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 18 are single weights. Consider leaning toward display fonts
    while you're still learning. You'll have more creative freedom and you might need
    1 or 2 weights, plus they're more fun to make. Above all: test print, make notes,
    fix, repeat. That's the part that most beginners miss and it's the most important
    thing.\r\n\r\nWhy so many weights? Someday when you blend a black to an ultralight
    in Fontlab or whatever, you'll feel a little rush and you'll understand: it's
    an addiction."

  body: "Maybe it's easier in fontlab, but I find making more weights a long and quite
    job. \"The number of weights doesn't necessarily add up to more sales.\" True,
    but I've heard of graphic designers that look how much megabyte a font is before
    even having a look. How stupid is that?! \"It's not a competition\" True, but
    some typedesigners try to make it a competition. \"Above all: test print, make
    notes, fix, repeat. That's the part that most beginners miss and it's the most
    important thing.\" True. I've made two very ugly fonts before where I skipped
    the repeat part, but I've learned my lesson now. I've spend my holiday in Turkey
    without a laptop, making adjustments to some prints and sketching a new typeface
    idea. Two years ago I would have never done that.\r\n\r\nThank you both for your
    help."

    to vector drawing in software that does a lot more, so making the shift to something
    as simple as TypeTool. But if you\u2019re fourteen and all you want to do is draw
    letters and TypeTool makes you happy, stick with it."

  body: 'As for the weights issue, it has never "impressed" me, nor have I decided
    on a face, simply because it had a wide range of weights. It simply makes the
    face more versatile and applicable by a designer. This is why faces such as Helvetica
    and Univers are so ubiquitous: the family is expansive and cohesive, therefore
    it''s easier to implement them harmoniously across an entire project/application.'

  body: "Hey Jasper, good work, I wish I'd started this kind of thing when I was 14,
    I'd be a lot further ahead now. 10 years is a long time in which to get things
    done.\r\n\r\nYou'll be fine in TypeTool for a while, getting your spacing and
    your outlines sorted. I purchased FontLab but as a novice I only use it in a very
    rudimentary fashion anyway, I'm pretty sure I am not using very many of the features.
    All in good time.\r\n\r\nExpletus looks interesting.\r\n\r\nRegarding very large
    families, I probably wouldn't purchase large families, but I can imagine buying
    a couple of weights at any given moment and this combination changing for different
    jobs, so I guess I appreciate the options."
