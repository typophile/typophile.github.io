  body: I'm very sorry, Renko. I feel your redirect pain. The only way to prevent
    such things for our German and Austrian customers would be to convince those local
    FontShops to join our website at FontShop.com.

  body: "Well, thanks for the answer, Stephen. But I think the shops will stay with
    the redirecting-tool because of the better comfort for customers when they want
    to buy a font (at the right, local, shop). It makes sense, for sure, but it is
    some times annoying for linking to a typeface. And, yes, sometimes it works with
    the \"double-click-trick\" to fool the redirect-tool. \r\nHave a  nice day, too. "
