  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone, I'm designing a calendar for the year 2005. Instead of having a traditional saints' feast days, like those that can be seen on church calendars, I'd like to try having a &quot;patron typographer,&quot; or something like that, for each day. Some of these typogragraphers/type designers would have further details/descriptions/portraits/work samples/etc., and some would only have their names listed. <BR> <BR>So, who has a &quot;patron saint,&quot; whose spirit they try to channel for inspiration? <BR> <BR>Conversely, does anyone have &quot;typographic demon,&quot; whose presence occasionally needs to be exorcised from your work? <BR> <BR>Dan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can't believe I'm about to defend Gill&hellip;. <BR> <BR>I just wanted to point out that Johnston's Underground typeface started out as a collaboration between Gill and Johnston. Gill actually got paid some substantial fee for his contribution. But he dropped out before the project was finished. <BR> <BR>So Johnston Underground had substantial input from Gill, and therefore accusing Gill of &quot;ripping it off&quot; seems pretty goofy to me. <BR> <BR>That being said, I still have a lot of questions about his personal life that would lead me to think twice about considering him a typographic saint.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, a year does have 365 days! Just like the Catholic Church's calendar of saints (if that's what it is really called?) My calendar will have saints days on many days (like a third of them, so far). My list may not be long enough! Some saints are paired up on church calendars, too, making the list even longer. <BR> <BR>What I don't want to make is something like Pentagram's 2004 calendar. They got 12 designers (living and dead) picked. Each month has the days set in a different typeface. In addition to holidays, the 12 type designers birthdays are listed. That is a neat promo piece, but I'm not going to learn anything new from it. I'd like my calendar to be a bit more encyclopedic. <BR> <BR>Since we are on the subject of religion, let me issue a public mea culpa here for including GGL on my list!  <BR> <BR>Since this will be my calendar, the list sort of follows my interests. I don't think that I could hurt my own feelings  You'll notice that there are several &quot;Offenbachers&quot; on the list (Klingspors, Koch, Hoefer), since I'm studying there now, and am naturally interested on what happend there in the past.  <BR> <BR>I'm going to have to stay steadfast with Gill, though. His work has inspired me for years. Although he most certaintly was, in some regards, a shady character, we are only speaking about allegations here. He has been dead since 1940, and rumors have a funny way of spreading. If you give me definitive legal evidence that he molested children, or engaged in rampant beastiality, I'll take him off my list. Ok?</div>

The &quot;child&quot; was his daughter, but it's not clear to me what a good minimum age is for a consenting adult. The dog on the other hand was probably too down-to-earth to have consented, but a dog is a dog; you should see what &quot;respectable&quot; people do to cows in preparing hamburger patties&hellip; And the good news for Gill is that he wasn't <i>unflinching</i> about it - he does seem to have had an internal struggle and remorse. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
