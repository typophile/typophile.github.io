  the font that displays \"City of Banker, LA\". \r\nMy untrained eye has not been
  able to determine something even moderately close because everything I have tried
  so far does not include small caps. \r\n\r\nAttachment of the image in question
  is also attached.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nCarey"

  body: "I don't think those are TRUE small caps; I'll bet they are capital letters
    set at a smaller type size. \r\n\r\nI say this because the thickness of the line
    changes dramatically between the caps and \"small caps\" -- something you wouldn't
    be likely to see in TRUE small caps. "
