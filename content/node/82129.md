  body: "Maybe First Class would do as an ID. This movie brings me goose bumps. It's
    because it's no ordinary movie of comics heroes.  A new director, brand-new cast
    and going back in time approach to the tale should make \u201CFirst Class\u201D
    a hit. I read this here: <a title=\"Have a look at the mutant appeal in X-Men:
    First Class\" href=\"http://www.newsytype.com/6971-xmen-first-class/\">X-Men:
    First Class brings mutant attraction back, newstype.com</a>."
