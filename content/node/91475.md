  body: "Lima-\r\nYeah, like Trajan, but I was hoping we might find a face from the
    20s. Twombly made Trajan in the late 80s.\r\n\r\nAren't the \"O,\" \"R,\" and
    \"2\" terrific?"

    a typeface that predates your sample. You'll like the R.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/serif/GrandCentral/"

  body: Centaur was designed in 1914 and bears some resemblance (and is a nice, elegant
    titling face).

  body: Does it matter that Trajan was designed in the 80s, when it was modeled after
    113 AD?

  body: "Thanks. As always, this gang was very helpful.\r\nGrand Central is very nice
    and Centaur has some characteristics that are close, too.\r\nI just wish I could
    find something with that crazy \"O\"!"
