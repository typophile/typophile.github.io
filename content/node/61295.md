  you good typography layout examples (or \"rules\", like how to make your text look
  right by using 2 styles for example, italic and small caps) such as http://www.seedconference.com/.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "You gave to that site too much credit. It's not so good. Too many styles(all
    caps, small caps, italics, bold, different color), all caps instead of small caps
    in some places, faux small caps created by just lowering the size, not respecting
    x-height. It all look like mental mess. \r\n\r\nGood book for exploring typography
    is [[http://http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251110194&sr=8-1|Elements
    of typographic style]] \r\n\r\nAlso check http://www.webtypography.net/\r\n_\r\n\r\nSandro"
