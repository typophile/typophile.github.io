  ID'ing any of the typefaces in the photo would be ideal. I think there are about
  5 different typefaces on this ad, so any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nDanny[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kewmotorinn_ad_5398.jpeg]"

  body: 'fvilanakis ...you''ve been linking to eaglefonts a lot lately. That might
    be fine, but that site, given that it has so many ''almost identical'' typefaces
    makes me suspect that that''s not a legitimate site to be referencing. '

  body: "Hi Darrel,\r\n\r\nIt's true that some of the fonts of eaglefonts seems to
    be forgeries or at least non-verifiable-source copies of other legitimate fonts.\r\nI
    'm trying to link to it <strong>only</strong> if I can't find any other legitimate
    source (myfonts, fontshop, dafont, etc) to show how a specific font looks like,
    and <strong>only</strong> if they have marked the font as \"Commercial\" and they
    do not provide a download link.\r\nThat said, I agree that's no good to increase
    the traffic of a non-legitimate site, so I 'll stop linking to it."
