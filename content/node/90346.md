  body: If you have  a font editing program just go in and select all glyphs and click
    remove overlap and then regenerate the font. Just be aware that this may violate
    the designer's conditions but they should have done it in the first place. Things
    like this are common with freeware fonts.

    overlap won't help in this case -- you need to correct the path direction (in
    FLS Contour-->Paths-->Set PS/TT Direction).\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: I'd assume it's not the only direction error. If you select all glyphs and
    do what agisaak said you get 'em all in one shot.

    a free font, then <em>caveat emptor</em>. If you purchased it, you could try contacting
    the foundry/designer and requesting that they fix the problem."

  body: "OK, so according to the \"left hand rule\" the font paths were indeed backwards.
    So I revered all paths for that letter, then did the Set PS/TT Direction for that
    letter, then saved the font and re-imported and...it's still doing the same thing.\r\n\r\nI
    noted that there are many more glyphs that do not oben the \"left hand rule\"
    as well, but only the \"g\" is giving me overlap errors. I'll keep at it, but
    I'm eager to hear any more suggestions."

  body: OK, I get it now. I set all glyphs to the TT Direction and the problem is
    solved. Thanks so much everyone!
