body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI have recently been using Fontlab 5 (running on Windows
  7) to create my first font. After struggling against a few issues, and winning the
  battle thanks to this forum, and some other places, I can now enjoy the pleasure
  of seeing my first font almost finished. \r\n\r\nThrough this process, I created
  characters to cover most European languages, and also \"Cyrillic based\"  - I have
  absolutely no idea if I can actually \"say\" that, but let's try :) - languages.
  I have used kerning classes and generated kerning features thanks to these classes.\r\n\r\nI
  have been doing some reading over the past few weeks, and to be honest, I don't
  really know what to believe or who to trust when it comes to kerning. Here is what
  stays in my mind : kerning isn't understood the same way in different software.
  Can this be considered true ? I understand this must feel like a real \"newbie\"
  question, but I guess you've got to start somewhere, eh ? :)\r\n\r\nLet's sum up
  what I think I have understood : Microsoft Word doesn't \"interpret\" kerning -
  or at least I've tested this thanks to friends who use Office 2003 and 2007. Concerning
  Adobe Photoshop, kerning can be as the one I've made, but \"metrics\" isn't selected
  by default in the \"Character\" window - or is it, and it could be actually me who
  changed that without remembering ? I was surprised to see that my font was displayed
  correctly in many open source software, such as Gimp, OpenOffice or AbiWord - I'm
  also a Linux user on a personal basis.\r\n\r\nSo, here's what I thought : Could
  there actually be something I missed when generating/making the font ? Or are these
  common issues I actually have never heard of ? I have been reading about Microsoft
  Word and kerning that had to be \"activated\" or something, but to be 100% honest,
  I haven't found any accurate information concerning this.\r\n\r\nI'm sure some of
  you must have already been in this situation, so this is why I'm asking for your
  help to understand this issue better.\r\n\r\nThank you for the time you spent reading
  this, and thank you in advance for your contribution.\r\n\r\nFrederic\r\n"

    programmers are not good enough to write code that can correctly interpret OpenType
    class kerning. This is a known issue and has been around forever. When I test
    fonts in Word I just make sure that the entire character set can be displayed
    and that the font naming works with Word\u2019s insipid font Menu. Beyond that
    I don\u2019t worry about Word, because most people who need to do serious typesetting
    will use an appropriate tool rather than Microsoft\u2019s third-rate word processor."

  body: "Hello James, and thank you for your answer.\r\n\r\nI couldn't agree more
    with what you say about Microsoft Word. I don't know why I picked this software
    as the first one in my original topic, maybe I thought it was the most \"spread\".
    But you're 100% right, people might be using this font in much more appropriate
    tools.\r\n\r\nSo I got this part right, so far, about the Microsoft Word issue
    :)\r\n\r\nHave you got any idea about the Adobe Photoshop part ? I've read over
    the web that some Adobe products used to have \"problems\" regarding fonts in
    general, and kerning in particular. But I have no idea what's the status regarding
    this with the latest versions.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say in my original post that
    the Windows preview (by \"Windows preview\" I mean, the window that opens when
    you double-click on a font file) doesn't show kerning at all, but maybe this could
    be related to the first part of your answer :)\r\n\r\nNow that I'm thinking about,
    does the file format (being either .ttf or .otf) have anything to do with the
    kerning and its interpretation in software later ? I'm pretty confused about that
    to be honest. But this is another subject :)\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help

    really. I\u2019ve heard grumbles about this, but I don\u2019t do much testing
    in Photoshop because it makes type a PITA in general.\r\n\r\n<cite>Now that I'm
    thinking about, does the file format (being either .ttf or .otf) have anything
    to do with the kerning and its interpretation in software later ?</cite>\r\n\r\nIf
    the kerning is done as an OpenType feature it probably shouldn\u2019t matter because
    the code will be the same in an OpenType or TrueType font. But there are other
    ways to build kern tables for those formats. So\u2026maybe? But Microsoft doesn\u2019t
    seem interested in explaining its incompetencies to the people affected by them,
    so we will never really know."

    programmers are not good enough to write code that can correctly interpret OpenType
    class kerning.\u201D. And that is true. OpenType kerning exists in Microsoft word,
    and it does not interpret OpenType class kerning correctly. Given that Microsoft
    is one of the companies behind the OpenType specification, and that Microsoft
    has had years and several versions of office to get it right, the only logical
    conclusion is that the Word programmers just aren\u2019t very good."

  body: "<cite>... \u2013 millions of legacy documents would reflow</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's
    not a valid reason. Word documents may already reflow by the simple act of opening
    them on another computer. \r\n\r\nFor some reason, Word insists on re-flowing
    text <em>for the currently selected printer</em>, taking its ppi and whatnot into
    account. While that's very printer-friendly (the hardware kind -- i.e., possibly
    intended to get the best possible output per desktop printer), it results in printers
    (the people) accepting a document from a client, opening it to print to PDF, and
    then seeing headings at the bottom of the page, page numbers in contents and indexes
    off, a totally different number of pages, etc.\r\n\r\nBack in the day when we
    <em>used to</em> accept \"print-ready\" Word documents I always had a blast, moving
    from one printer setting, one Word version, and one computer to another, attempting
    to find the magic combination that suddenly made the document at least <em>appear</em>
    correct.\r\n\r\nWe now circumvent these issues by telling clients to generate
    a PDF themselves. Not a thankful job either (as the typical Word user doesn't
    have a clue of what a Virtual PDF Printer is, where to find it, and why their
    document may reflow when they install and select it) but at least we moved the
    problem off our desk towards the client."

    is exactly as it should be, as long as \"metrics\" is selected for kerning in
    the \"Character\" window. What I was wondering was if the \"metrics\" choice was
    selected by default, or if \"0\" was the default choice. But then I guess that
    people are used to choosing between \"metrics\", \"optical\" or something else,
    aren't they ?\r\n\r\nJames, what do you mean by \"PITA\" ? All I know about PITA
    is this awesome Arabic bread, but I assume it doesn't have much to with typography

    I begin the understand part of the problem.\r\n\r\nAll these questions really
    feel like beginner's trouble to me, don't they ? I was wondering, is there a way
    of \"testing\" the font to see if everything works as it should ? Or do you just
    have to install it and open it in every software you can to see it for yourself
    ? :)"

    display fonts and not worry much about how they look in Word. The established
    designers can end up selling a ten-font family to an international corporation
    with 150,000 employees who used three different versions of Office across three
    versions of Windows, and Mac OS, and have external contractors. That\u2019s when
    it gets really ugly.\r\n\r\n<cite>I was wondering, is there a way of \"testing\"

    files in Indesign. Indesign isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s a pretty incredible
    piece of software. And the complex find/replace system with support for regular
    expressions makes building proofs a breeze."
