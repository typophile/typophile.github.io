  body: "A rounded easy to read script with almost no variation in contrast. There
    are quite a few that resemble your sample, but I have not found an exact match.
    Ryuk's list has some good alternatives. An early script in this genre is <a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/monoline-script-mt/\">Monoline
    Script MT</a> from 1933. The flavor of your sample seems to match a font by Mark
    Simonson based on an old movie title. It's called <a href=\"http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/lakeside/\">Lakeside</a>.

    a rather full search of possible fonts I have fond nothing that matches these
    letters.\r\nI conclude that there is no font that matches the \"Alessandro Vitalle\"
    logo/wordmark and that it is lettering designed to create a corporate identity
    in the jewelery products industry.\r\nDon"
