body: "Hi -\r\n\r\nI've been trying to figure out what typeface this is for a couple
  of days now (regular and embellished weights are attached). More examples of it
  can be found at http://atseasonspeak.publix.com/. One of the identifying characteristics
  is the \"G\" - it's possible that there are no lowercase characters. \r\n\r\nAny
  ideas? Similar typeface recommendations would be great as well. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I looked at Dafont for quite a while, but couldn't come up with anything
    too close. It sure seems like they have used random noise to make it look hand-stamped,
    because the disruptions are not duplicated. I looked at MyFonts for outlined and
    shadow sans, and didn't see any good matches. I finally gave up on that and looked
    for grunge sans. This isn't a match, but maybe you could achieve a similar look:
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeart/bellamie/\">Bellamie</a>. It has
    the right R and general letterforms are close. That G is not something I recognize,
    but maybe someone else will spot this one.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I agree, I think the example, \"embellished.jpg\" is a shadowed version that
    has been layered over the regular version of the typeface. I've added another
    example of the shadowed version without any Photoshopping (or so it seems)...\r\n\r\nI
    appreciate your suggestion, thanks for your help!"
