<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>written language is how human beings store and communicate information. it seems like there is no other way... i'm very interested in the radical directions typography could take in the near and distant future. are we always going to use glyph-based forms? how will type be presented in a world that is becoming more and more technologically-dependent? will text always exist? these are questions i ponder.
in short, i'm trying to build a bridge between technological progress/evolution and typography. i will also be contacting futurists/singulatarians and typographers as part of my research.
i'm looking for feedback - opinions, thoughts, contacts, essays, lectures etc. i realize my sketch is very broad. anything goes.
i'm a young college student in my first year of graphic design, and i'm trying to collect an archive of information so i can build a conceptual font hybrid [as opposed to a purely aesthetic font]. i'm struggling with how i can <strong>visually</strong> manifest letterforms based on the concepts that interest me. as of now, i have found very little relative literature. blogs seem like a good alternative.
whatever you can offer will help, i assure you!

<div class=commentbody>Find a library that has issues of Emigre magazine and read them. Fuse magazine will be harder to find, but seems quite applicable here. You should also read Gerard Unger’s book <em>While You’re Reading</em>. It is not directly relevant and will not answer any of your questions, but it will give you a great foundation in understanding what type and reading are, and why they are what they are, which will make it easier to think about where it’s all headed. Last, contact Nick Shinn about his essay <em>It’s Hip to Be Square</em>. It’s a great read about why traditional type designs will become less relevant and new type will be square.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I highly suggest you absorb mr. Martin Venezy's written thoughts called "Design and Melancholy." You can find this essay in his amazing book "It is Beautiful ... Then Gone." [ along with the most impressive hand-made typographic experiments I have ever seen. ]
In great depth and consideration, it ponders the simple moments of our lives when we find an arrangement of things, circumstances, interactions, and / or ideas that appear in a fleeting instance as perfectly designed — as if beyond human capability — and then are just as quickly gone from our perceptions. Within that moment, pure beauty is realized in the simplest of forms and it is in this realization that we, as designers, can create the kind of conceptual wonders that you are aiming for.
martin's design studio can be found here :: [[http://www.appetiteengineers.com/| Appetite Engineers ]]</div>

<div class=commentbody>with regard to mr. berkson's commentary and opinions...
If typing in lowercase is an issue for the majority on this forum, I will gladly compromise. Let me clarify that I'm not looking for degradation or a "flame war." I really do want feedback. This forum was recommended to me by a professor for research purposes - as a tool.
I'm not asking anyone to do my "homework" for me. I'm interested in thoughts, opinions and suggestions. I want to learn. I understand that at this venue in my career, I don't know as much about typography as a middle-aged individual who has dedicated their life to design.
Back to the subject at hand...
Thanks in advance for any contributions, I really do appreciate it. I am in talks with the head of "special collections" at my university library, which is also proving helpful. He is the only mentor I have right now, aside from my type instructor.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The opening chapter of David Consuegra's <em>American Type Design & Designers</em> (Allworth Press) provides an excellent time-line of the technological changes in typography, with related events.
Text usually seems to be at the vanguard of new media technology, due, I think, to the alphabet's low "bit-rate" of information required for meaningful communication. So although we may develop more sophisticated ways of communicating with existing technologies, as long as we are inventing new media it will depend on text from the outset. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Agreed. Call me limited, but I cannot imagine a more practical and efficient communication tool than the alphabet. I'd like to see English spelling become more phonetic and logical, but that would take one serious bit of house cleaning, and everyone would have to be on board...or maybe that's evolving right now in the world of instant messaging (something else I know nothing about!). Finding a way to incorporate and convey tone and tempo might be nice, seeing as that's what people tend to have problems with when communicating with strangers over emails and in discussions like this. So, like economics, think about what the demands are, or will be, and start the forecasting there.

<div class=commentbody>In some ways text is more efficient than speech--more easily stored and searched, arguably easier to render decipherable--and in fact you can already see it encroaching on verbal communication. It might be an issue of not quite having reached the tipping point here, but why do people still use IM with the advent of things like Skype or other "internet phone" applications?
Think: have you ever seen someone send a text message when they're perfectly free to call someone? Or seen someone shoot off an email when they could just shout over the cubicle wall? </div>

<div class=commentbody>Totally. It's a little freaky...to me it's even a little bit sad.
Email over talking has been a huge source of tension and ironic inefficiency in our work environment. Everyone more or less agrees, but no one can help themselves. But how else can one person communicate an idea with multiple recipients simultaneously? I think that's what drives the email use more than anything else. Or it's just because it's so easy and we're all inherently lazy. Or maybe we're all just pressed for time, or so we think. Is it fear? Do we all subconsciously feel like we are running out of time and therefore everything is incredibly urgent? Are we running out of time? Or is it the availability of technology that lends itself to extreme urgency driving our behavior? Is my computer an extension of me or am I an extension of it?

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I am guilty of using text messaging or email when verbal communication is a feasible option.
There are a lot of other variables that factor in to whether or not I want to make face-to-face contact with another person I suppose. My mood or demeanor towards that person often come into play, for example. Sometimes it is easier just to say something in a text message because you're less likely to strike up a "conversation."
One can draw parallels between wireless communication and telepathy. This is how many computers are communicating today, right? So lets just say we begin merging our technology with the human body for the sake of "efficiency" (this is already happening on a small scale). If the biological computations of the human brain were to begin working more like a machine, how would this change human interaction and communication? What if we could communicate using only our minds without actually speaking?
I can't imagine what this would look like. Would our brains tell us we're hearing speech, or would we visualize letterforms and text? Or... would it be something else?
I apply this to typography as a craft and I get scatterbrained. Synaptic connections between two brains? What a mess.
Forgive me, my imagination poses a lot of questions. Just thoughts.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>Text usually seems to be at the vanguard of new media technology, due, I think, to the alphabet’s low “bit-rate” of information required for meaningful communication.</cite>
It’s funny how little of the alphabet needs to be intact for it to remain legible, yet little needs to change to make people start ranting about how horrible some changes are.
Interestingly, I have been told that Massismo Vignelli recently spoke at Parson’s where he stated that Emigre magazine was the worst thing that ever happened to design. When the audience laughed he told them that they shouldn’t laugh about Emigre; that they should cry over how horrible it was. Wim Crouwell was also there; it must have led to a pretty wild conversation. One of my professors is going to be sending notes from the session out soon, I’ll be sure to post them...</div>

Your questions are good : look at the children, they are small, but they think big.

<div class=commentbody>Names that come to mind: Marshall McLuhan. Paul Virilio. Mihai Nadin: "Civilization of Illiteracy", available online. Nicholas Negroponte: "Being Digital", no coherent theory but nice ideas. Maybe even Michael Giesecke: "Der Buchdruck in der fruehen Neuzeit" is about the development <cite>toward</cite> typographic culture, a wonderful exercise in regarding our culture as something which is not eternal but has a history too; I cannot find an English translation, maybe there are at least some related essays in English?
But I was never able to translate these thoughts into design. Theory is theory. Type is type, however much distorted it is.

<div class=commentbody>Eben is on it I think. What you need is a technology that bypasses the eye as the sensory input machine. But then you start bumping into all the non verbal information that is not keyed to letter and word shapes. So then maybe a technology that would bypass the optic nerve and visual data to simulate the visual data. Somehow I would think that if we beat the whole language virus and started working and communicating in pre-verbal thought the whole system of language would go away and no one would be interested in letter forms as communication.
tangentially speaking
So look at your premise, that written language is how we store information. Maybe written language is a very small part of this information exchange.

<div class=commentbody><strong>Eben Sorkin</strong> - Yes! Very much so along those lines.
All human knowledge is represented in glyph form via books. The internet is a giant book. It doesn't have to be that way, but its easy. There is nothing "better" to speak of.

<strong>jupiterboy</strong> - "What ever happened to virtual reality?"
A good question that came to mind when I read that article. I'm sure the answer has to do with pancapitalism... or something. More tangential goodness - What would affordable virtual reality that is indistinguishable from our perceived reality do the the world economy?
Regardless, I think that you are right. Written language and type are only a fraction of the bigger picture here.
My font isn't going to look like a recognizable alphabet at all. Its going to appear as electrical activity in the brain - my brain. I somehow doubt this is going to get me a passing grade.
I set the bar too high for this assignment. I should just do what everyone else in the class is doing... Pretty typefaces. [sigh]

I don't know what the bigger picture is. I doubt anyone does. But maybe a doubtful passing grade is better than a pretty face. Refer your instructor to the thread.

<div class=commentbody>I saw some primitive sensor to brain stuff that was happening in order to try to give vision back to people who had lost it. It was on a Scientific American TV show I think.. It was a sensor> electrode> brain model. It worked up to a point. The brain had to built up by practice and probably neural/brain growth to the point where it could interpret signals - but apparently that actually started happening. Resolution wasn't that great ( 80x80 pixels? ) but after a while a limited sense of vision was achieved. You might want to see what kind of wetware-jacking is the most up to date now and extrapolate from there. Maybe talk to a builder of the equipment.

<div class=commentbody>Perhaps I will have my professor journey here and take a gander when I complete the assignment. I'm going to print and include this thread as a part of the process book documenting my work. I don't want to jinx myself!
I agree that a doubtful passing grade is more important than a sexy font... But I have grad school to worry about, specifically paying for it. The more high marks, the better, right? Maybe I am being too cautious, but I'm always afraid of running out of "funding." Especially considering the types of employment and crappy wages currently endured... A waste of intelligence and ability. <-- Tangential vomit.
The concepts I'm addressing, both theoretical and otherwise, are going to be a great focus for the rest of my undergrad career. They'd make for a strong thesis or research proposal. Given the time constraints (the project is due in about one month) and the workload I have in other classes, I think I will "dumb down" my approach. If I can commit myself to one concept, I think my project will be successful.
That being said, I have narrowed down to a couple of concepts: dimensional typography and bouma shapes.
I know these are nothing new (80s-90s?), but they could be a stepping stone for the future of the craft. It would be nice to leave the current flatness of the Web behind for a more engaging, interactive "environment" in more dimensions than two. Perhaps I can create a typeface that is legible from any angle which can function in a fluid, ever-changing 3D environment. Or maybe I can work on simplifying type into only bouma word-shapes (word shape recognition being the key to speed reading, and therefore, a faster way to assimilate knowledge and information into our hungry minds). If I used bouma shapes, the stress would not be on the invidual characters, so I would have to somehow prove that it is applicable to any word combination.
Someone is going to scold me for changing my mind... I just know it. My professor (Fo Wilson) supports this move. I feel much more confident in choosing one of the theories from the last paragraph, and they do spark my interest. I am not dismissing any ideas I discussed earlier, I am merely saving for a time when I can do them more justice. I still have a lot to learn about our beloved typographical heritage. I will find my way to the avant-garde in this craft someday. I won't rest until I have contributed something to the world.</div>

Don’t try to obsess over a few topics or concepts during your undergrad work. That’s what advanced degrees are for. Sometimes you need to shut away some of your own intellect and focus on just learning and doing what you’re <em>supposed</em> to be doing. Getting into avant-garde stuff can be nice, but make sure you can pay the bills along the way.</div>

<div class=commentbody>As for bouma shapes, I think parallel letter recognition is the theory currently normal among researchers. So it might depends what you mean by bouma that partially determines the usefulness of your research; on the other hand, concern for bouma and concern for parallel recognition might have similar influences on type design for readability. Perhaps the real questions are: what kinds of divergence, and to what degree at the levels both of the glyph and of the alphabet, assist readability? And what kinds and degrees of divergence harm readability by attracting the reader's attention? Any answers must be largely empirical, though the research will need to be based upon a good understanding of type and typography if it's to arrive at useful results. Kevin Larson at Microsoft is, as far as I know, the most important guy doing this kind of work at the moment. He's posted here before.</div>
