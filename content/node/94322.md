  body: "I disagree.  Unger's new Prisma Pro uses four lines;  in the two sample images,
    HOLD GLORY is three lines and GOT GAME is five lines.\r\n\r\nFor GOT GAME, I like
    Mirage, by George Williams:\r\n[[http://www.fontspace.com/george-williams/mirage]]\r\n\r\nI
    found many three-line fonts, but none that match \"HOLD GLORY\" :(\r\n\r\n- Herb"

  body: "The download location for Dieter's version of Prisma (which was a memorial
    to Rudolph Koch) is at:\r\n[[http://moorstation.org/koch_memorial/dl/dl_02.htm|Steffmann
    Prisma]]\r\n\r\n Like much of his work, that one is probably a clone with many
    added characters/glyphs.  Might have been based on any of quite a few versions
    of this 5-line Prisma (e.g., Opti,  Williams) All have that question mark that's
    different than the OP's sample.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
