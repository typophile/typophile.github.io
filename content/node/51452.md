  face. I'm wondering if anyone has any tips on the matter. I'm pretty well introduced
  to vector drawing in general, but I'm wondering about better ways for being sure
  your letterforms are consistent, or perhaps what others do with baselines, etc.\r\n\r\nI've
  attached some experiments, I'll get more ofwhat I'm working on later.\r\n\r\nBrian"
