  lifestyle. \r\n\r\nWe're pleased to announce a storefront (still in pre-gussied-up
  CSS, but still very usable) to make the new 2007 \"Type Specimen\" tee and new found
  ephemera buttons available. We will also make available the remaining stock of past
  year's shirts where we have stock available.\r\n\r\nEven if the items aren't your
  thing, we invite you to contribute in any way you feel appropriate.\r\n\r\n<strong><a

    a young type deisgner. The whole Typophile material is very cool, I wish I have
    an international card to buy some buttons.\r\nIf you have some free time visit
    my little foundry website. the english version is coming soon, but the portuguese
    version is working fine, and you can travel on it by feeling.\r\n\r\ngreat hugs
    from Brasil,\r\n\r\nJuliano August\xB0\r\nwww.fonduefontes.com.br"

    all that big, I assure you.

  body: Dennis, we opted not to print XXL for this year's design since we have many
    leftover XXL from past years. We will be making these tees available soon. (I'm
    talking about the "Gas, Food, Type" tee designed by Christopher Simmons.)

    but when I go out to get the paper, I would like to make a fashion statement that
    takes some of the scrutiny from my toss-and-turned morning hair.\r\n\r\nGas, Food,
    Type sort of reminds me of my dream to open a \"Lingerie and Bait\" store near
    the beach, but that is another story.\r\n: )"
