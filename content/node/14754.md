  body: "Thanks Patty and Lex for the quick answers.\r\n\r\nFutura Light and Tempo
    both match pretty well, except for a few characters \r\nlike C, G, and M. I don't
    know of anyplace that sells the thin version of Tempo, \r\nso I just ended up
    creating outlines from Futura Light and tweaking characters.\r\n\r\nIf anyone
    else can place this type and knows of its availability somewhere, \r\nI still
    appreciate hearing about it, cuz I'd like to buy the font for future use.\r\n\r\ncriz"
