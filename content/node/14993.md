  body: Yeah, little bit. Did you know she got a nose job.. Whatashame. Beautiful
    like she was. Now it's all flat, artificial looking.

  body: "> she got a nose job\r\n\r\nJust goes to show that looks and brains are rarely
    found in the same person. The human consciousness cannot fully design [for] something
    \"natural\". As I pointed out in my Typo#13 article, the human nose is extremely
    complex*. And then they want us to believe they've actually nailed down the act
    of reading, which involves the retina, perception, and cognition. It's funny/sad
    how quickly hubris tends to verge on plain old idiocy. Reality is to Modernism
    what Katrina is to the Mistral.\r\n\r\n* http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4133093.stm\r\n\r\n>
    The Professional\r\n\r\nYes, a superb work.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n\r\n"
