  body: Your best bet would be to buy a sufficiently retro-style font, along the lines
    of <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=DET0000260#specimen>Dazzler</a>
    or <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000055>Trisect</a>.
    There are a bunch of similar ones out there. But do you want to make it yourself?
    In that case, outline a font you like, duplicate it a number of times, and mess
    with the curves to get it to look right. But I'd recommend buying something instead.

    (say 1pt) in the background colour and copy it to a lower layer then make a wider
    white stroke (11pt), copy to lower layer, make the new stroke a tiny bit wider
    (13pt), copy again and make white stroke (23pt). The figures are based on the
    thin strokes being 1pt and the white strokes 5pt, but you would have to finetune
    it to get it right. The other thing to keep an eye on is how the ends of the strokes
    are affected.\r\nTim\r\n\r\n*the line that runs through the centre of the character"
