body: "I am kinda having a hard time trying to post this so I hope this works. This
  post is for anyone who loves hand lettering as much as I do. These are some recent
  and not so recent projects that I have done. The \"Glad I did logo\" was for a lady
  who is writing a book about caring for an elderly lady with special needs. The script
  is in my own style. Eliza Schulte thought the D looked like an O. I can see where
  it does. Moes wanted his logo to have a vintage feel to it. I think I nailed it
  while still being somewhat contemporary. I plan on making the word \"Truck Repair\"
  into a font someday. I plan on calling it Moes Thick and Thin. The Prince logo got
  rejected. They thought it looked like a book cover. I have to agree with them on
  that one, but it was a lot of fun to design. :)\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\n-Charles

    There aren't a lot of these, especially in heavy weights. Those that do exist
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/scangraphic/globe_sb_ultra/\">haven't
    aged well</a>. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mvb_fonts/mvb_magnesium/\">Magnesium</a>
    is one of the only heavy sans serifs with contrast that really work in a contemporary
    design."

  body: The Truck Repair one looks similar to Boca Raton http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/boca-raton/
    with some improvements. For example, the "A" goes the right direction in yours!
