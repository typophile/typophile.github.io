body: "This ambigram didn't have any specific purpose, more of a personal challenge.\r\n\r\nI
  used Bodoni as the basis. I wanted to make a different amibgram than a blackletter
  or script, since they seem to be the most forgiving to the form. I thought a modern
  serif could work & look somewhat unique.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_kptql4Mv2a1qz4tq8o1_500_5509.jpg.jpeg]"

  body: "I wonder if an 'fi' ligature might be worth trying.\r\n'y''s tail needs strengthening
    (a 'u' predominates - it could almost be a u-ogonek). Did you consider a more
    uppercase form of I?"

  body: "I did try an fi ligature but it ended up hurting the perception of the t.
    the f ligature rotated 180 degrees is hard to see as 'i t'\r\n\r\nthe strengthening
    of the y tail is also something i tried but it made the initial i look less like
    an i\r\n\r\ni like the idea of the uppercase I in the 2nd and 3rd i. I might try
    it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\r\n[[http://rbtl.us|Read

  body: "In an ambigram its natural that legibility is slightly compromised, but I
    have some issues with this. The \"in\" that flips to become \"y\" is not reading
    clearly as either one. \r\n\r\nAlso the \"N\" I realize is uppercase because it
    needs to flip, but it stands out a lot. Is it a smallcap or is it a shrunken uppercase
    N? Its stroke seems thin to me.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I see an \"N\" encased in
    characters. I piece together the \"infinity\" afterwards because I have previous
    knowledge that its an ambigram and thats the word to look for.\r\n\r\nI think
    the various stroke widths and the many serifs are throwing me off most."
