    It's hard to judge the phrase completely out of context, but I think it can apply
    to a lot of industrial design, or to modernist ideas about design in general --
    uncluttering rather than cluttering, making things easier to use rather than harder.
    Good design usually has these objectives.\r\n\r\nI had to read a couple of Munari's
    books in my first year of design school, but that was a long time ago (the mid-1980s),
    and I can't recall if this phrase was in them.  :-)"

    oversimplify -- I don't think you can always apply it, or that it applies to everything.
    It's like saying that all you ever need are 5 or 6 typefaces.  ;-)\r\n\r\n<em>\"Progress

  body: "<em>I think technological progress is often an illusion of simplicity. The
    designer\u2019s task is often made more compex in the pursuit of simplicity!</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    no doubt about that.\r\n\r\n<em>Perhaps the quote itself is a simplification of
    the issue!</em>\r\n\r\nThe implication of progress is improvement over what existed
    before. But progress is more complex and involved than that.\r\n\r\n<em>Against
    aesthetics it holds quite true...</em> \r\n\r\nPart of me wants to believe it,
    but history shows progress in art and design to be cyclic. What starts off simple
    (artefacting of the medium and tools notwithstanding) is made more complex and
    elaborate by the addition of \"new\" ideas and philosophies; sometimes these additions
    are called \"refinement\", and conceived of as progress, a \"progression\" over
    what came before them. Complexity accumulates until the state of the art is incapacitated
    by excessive detail and protuberances. At this point a backlash usually occurs
    and art is returned to a simpler state.\r\n\r\nAfter a while we become bored by
    simplicity, and the process begins again. Complexity builds and builds until we
    can stand it no more. The cycle of progress goes on, like a tide. Simplicity and
    complexity fall in and out of fashion. \r\n\r\nMunari's conception of progress
    appears typical of the early 20th century modernist backlash against the decorative
    excesses of late 19th century art and design. Tschichold prescribed simple sans
    serif typefaces and simple compositions as the ideal for the 20th century---to
    begin with---but later recanted in favor of more sophisticated classical design
    from the 16th and 15th centuries. \r\n\r\nIn essence, progress, or progression,
    is change, a move towards something either less complex of more complex. The definition
    given for progress depends on what part of the cycle we're in.\r\n\r\nj a m e

  body: "Current examples of \"progress\" not answering to simplification.\r\n\r\n<strong>Design
    & Aesthetics</strong>\r\nThe leading edge in linear or sans serif typeface design
    is moving away from the simple models of the 19th & 20th centuries towards models
    of increased complexity, borrowing from seriffed type designs. The trend began
    with fonts like Rotis sans and its jarred rounds, designed by Otl Aicher. According
    to Identifont.com, \"With Rotis, Aicher was searching for the clearest legibility
    by combining elements of serif and sans serif.\" The Rotis series (superfamily)
    also introduced the semi-sans (designed 1989), using a stressed stroke in an otherwise
    linear type design.\r\n\r\nMore complexity came with FF Legato, designed by Evert
    Bloemsma 2004, and is continuing with Microsoft Candara, designed by Gary Munch.
    According to Ascender Corporation, \"Candara is a casual humanist sans with verticals
    showing a graceful entasis on stems, high-branching arcades in the lowercase,
    large apertures in all open forms, and unique ogee curves on diagonals. The resultant
    texture is lively but not intrusive, and makes for a friendly and readable text.\"
    According to Wikipedia, \"Candara is featured in the Microsoft ClearType Font
    Collection, a set of fonts developed to take advantage of ClearType to improve
    the reading experience in Windows Vista and Office 2007.\"\r\n\r\nITC Officina,
    designed by Erik Spiekermann and Ole Sch\xE4fer 1990 - 1998, promoted serifs on
    i & j, curled stem tips and bent entry & exit strokes for a condensed information
    sans with enhanced text performance. \r\n\r\nNick Shinn's Preface (2003), \"...switches
    the emphasis, driving out diagonals to create a dominant harmony of curves and
    perpendiculars, matched with a greater variety of inter-character space shapes.
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/preface/\">Nick describes the design
    and its principles.</a> \r\n\r\nThen there is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/sebastian/\">Frantisek
    Storm's Sebastian</a> (2003). According to the blurb, \"Sebastian Sans-serif typefaces
    compensate for their basic handicap \u2013 an absence of serifs \u2013 with a
    softening modulation typical of roman typefaces.\"\r\n\r\nFormata (1984), designed
    by Bernd M\xF6llenst\xE4dt, \"Instead of linear severity common to many sans serifs,
    Formata offers curved strokes and interesting details that are subtle in smaller
    sizes but distinguishable in larger sizes, thus, appropriate for both text and
    display.\"\r\n\r\nSurely these developments are considered progress? Sans serif
    typeface design is not becoming simpler, it is moving away from reductive modernism
    by growing in richness and complexity.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Technology</strong>\r\nFont
    technology has grown from the simple Type 1 format of yesteryear to the increasingly
    complex monster called OpenType. A feature-laden OT font simplifies typesetting
    matters for the user, but for typeface designers and developers the job is becoming
    more and more complex. Try developing a text font with built-in smallcaps and
    trying to make the kerning values for the lowercase work with those smallcaps.\r\n\r\nj
