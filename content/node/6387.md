body: Hi. <BR> <BR>these are some ideas for a record shop logo. The basic idea behind
  the shop is that it sells english folk and global roots music, as well as more cutting
  edge, electonic and indie sounds. The name &#39;folkdevils&#39; is taken from the
  book &#39;folk devils and moral panics&#39;.. <BR> <BR>thanks for any comments in
  advance. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47636.gif"

  body: 'Tom: <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t worry about your &#34;O-Devil&#34; looking like
    the one Photo posted. Unless you create a detailed illustration of a devil, you
    can bet that there are going to be other devils out there that look similar to
    yours. Relative to the Bravo Devil that Photo posted, I think your goatee element
    is an improvement. If you do pursue this &#34;O-Devil&#34;, I would recommend
    using a heavier type that would allow you to use the &#34;O-Devil&#34; as a stand
    alone mark. Also, I recommend avoiding the use of additional graphic elements
    &#40;&#34;O-Devil&#34; plus the fiddle graphic&#41;. Although in your last concept,
    I do see the potential of a V-neck and a pitchfork &#40;i-l&#41; accompanying
    the &#34;O-Devil&#34; head. <BR> <BR>Most importantly, find another typeface.
    Considering the title, I would either look for something bold, very stylized,
    or both.'

    target="_blank">Vendetta</a> being used for instance. The letter o in Vendetta
    has a somewhat human shape already. You could also use the small caps for the
    word MUSIC to set it off in a different way.

    shop is folk and world music, but it differentiates itself from the rest of the
    folky shops in that it sells more cutting edge stuff.. So I wanted something that
    captured the traditional style &#40;albertus&#41;, with something clean and modern
    to suggest a new direction.. thats whay I chose the '

    Incorporating it into the type is a bit cute and you want to be modern and folksy

    &#34;Vendetta&#34; suggestion is a very good one. Vendetta captures both folk
    and devils in a single typeface, but remains edgy and broad enough to encompass
    electronic and indie sounds also'

  body: Hey, <BR>I think you should make some custom lettering here... why go with
    already defined shapes? The &#34;Fette Fraktur Hybrid&#34; looks like a cheap
    copy of the &#34;Royal Family&#34; from Thirstype. Electronic music lovers truly
    have a great sense for design as well... I think you can do better. Try to create
    something that communicates the idea behind the Record Store...

  body: Andreas, <BR> <BR>the FF thing was my first attempt at custom type, and, as
    I said, it needed work, but it was just an idea, wich didn&#39;t really give the
    right impression.. <BR> <BR>I think you have the wrong idea of the shop. It sells
    folk music, and roots music from all over the world. It also has a small selection
    &#40;it is a small shop, in a small town&#41;, of electronic music. Therefore,
    the logo needs to have a very broad appeal.. it cannot appeal uniquely to the
    lovers of electronic music. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47793.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>What we need is something clean, minimal, with elements of traditional,
    modern and music &#40;a touch of rebellion would be nice as well&#41;.. here

  body: Tom, <BR>I misunderstood the concept a bit. Sorry. <BR>I didn&#39;t mean the
    logo should appeal to electronic music lovers only, but people that still buy
    their music do it with a big interest &#40;people like me&#41;, and therefor the
    logo doesn&#39;t have to be a &#34;youth-catcher&#34; like Brittney Spears Commercial
    Dadaism for example. I think any commercial work can be as radical as the designer
    want it to be. There are already to much klich

  body: I really like that first fD mark, but the type isn&#39;t doing anything for
    me. Have you tried using the same stye of type that is on the mark for the logotype?
    If you were to do this, they probably wouldn&#39;t work well together, but separately
    the mark and the logotype might be really strong. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: The only problem with this whole concept is the internet will cause your friends
    business to fail. The business, now is shifted to internet downloads that are
    paid. I suggest in two years you will find anything you want to hear at a paid
    download site.
