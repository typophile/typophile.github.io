  to the existing and select a new one, the new one is listed by name on my profile,
  but the old one remains. i've tried deleting and logging out, then reading a post
  to verify a blank space, then logging in and selecting the new icon for my profile,
  only to have the old one re-appear ! spooky.\r\n\r\nis there a tech admin ?\r\n\r\n2)
  do other folks see in forum categories that \"critique\" is the only category without:
  \ topics/posts/latest listings ? there's some good threads in there worth tracking.\r\n\r\ncheers.\r\n"

  body: '2) I think that''s because "Critique" has subcategories. If you click on
    that link they come up. I''ve always found the description "Typefaces on the chopping
    block" misleading, it was years before I realized there were the categories: "Logo
    / Corporate ID" and "Typography / Composition" buried there. I thought that Critique
    was about type design only. Personally I''d rather see those two topics under
    "Design" instead.'

    even less business than the "Critique" subforums.
