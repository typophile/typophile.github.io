  different type combinations to present in my comps. I need clean and modern. I like
  the roundness of Futura or Avant Garde for one concept. Any compliments to those?\r\n\r\nAny
  other suggestions?"

  body: I think an alternative energy (I presume eco friendly) company would benefit
    from something with a bit more human characteristics than a geometric sans serif.
    You could still be clean and modern, but Futura and Avant Garde seem more machine-imposing-on-nature
    in this case.

    new and trendy will do (but not retro like Gotham), classic modernism and traditionalism
    are tainted."
