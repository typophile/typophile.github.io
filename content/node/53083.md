    using a minimalist style that emulates some of the old newspaper look.\r\n\r\nThe
    style I am going for is somewhat like these 2 sites:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.danielmall.com/\">http://www.danielmall.com/</a>\r\n<a

  body: The two links you cited as models suggest 19th-Century typography. Your designs
    refer to 18th-Century styles. It matters because the former says "industry" and
    the latter says "enlightenment." What fits better with the way you want to present
    yourself?

    the fourth logo is more interesting.

    am trying to redo it completely because I think I missed the mark on this one.\r\n\r\nSo
    for my new portfolio, to which the above is going to be the logo, I'll be using
    Garamond Premier Pro as my main typeface for the headings. It'll be a fairly simple
    site the main emphasis being the pieces of work, based on a grid.\r\n\r\nI used
    Hoefler Text in the 4th piece above. I'd like to present myself as a competent
    designer/developer who enjoys beautiful typography. Hope that helps. Thanks for
    the help guys."

  body: "I'd like to see your name in the two different weights used in no. 4  in
    combination with the titles on either side as no.1, however, I would suggest removing
    the graphic as it doesn't seem to have any relevance other than to separate your
    titles which could be done without a graphic. I feel like the graphic was thrown
    in as an after-thought, but only because your using the rules above and below
    your typography to essentially frame your name.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to go
    with the style of the bottom three samples, where you're titles are going to be
    below your rules, then I might suggest \"Designer/Developer\" with a bit of space
    between, and playing with the weights of those as well. I wouldn't use the same
    weight usage as your name with the heavier weight on the left, because then your
    logo will become unbalanced. One other thing to consider is what your message
    is going to be through your logo. With emphasis on your name, the logo is about
    you, and with emphasis on your titles, the emphasis becomes about what you're
    providing."

  body: "I like the latest no 4, because of the cleanliness. It gets your point across
    concisely, and the separations between you and what you do make the message have
    a bit more authority. It might be an optical illusion, but it looks like the bottom
    rules don't match the same spacing as your top rules, I didn't notice it until
    now. I'd be interested to see your thoughts on it, as it is your logo.\r\n\r\nSide
    note: I had a typo in my previous post, I was referring to no. 3 weights, not
    no. 4. However, I think that the latest versions work much better."

    the rules adjusted to match).\r\n\r\nBy the way, I think you're right about your
    web site needing a redesign. The wood grain background and flashy picture frames
    fight against your desired image of a competent, careful designer interested in
    good typography.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When

    like any of the monograms. It seems to me that since the C in Charles is basically
    a circular shape (however elipical it is) that you should be able to come up with

  body: No. 4 still. I agree with with a2z on both accounts. If you want a monogram,
    you could do something with the second from the left. I'd try out JC within the
    two circles. I'd also loose the fill effect between the two circles, and I'd play
    with the weights of their strokes. You don't want your frame to overpower.
