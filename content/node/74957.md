body: "Hello, \r\nWhen I first exported my typeface (in OTF), it looked very distorted
  and pixelated. I managed to solve that problem by going back to Fontlab, and making
  all the glyphs 50% smaller. In that way I got the desired result (I would like to
  take the opporunity to show it to you), but now my typeface is significantly smaller
  than any other.\r\n\r\nMy question is: why is this happening and how to make the
  typeface bigger whithout damaging the quality?\r\n\r\nAlso feel free to comment
  on the typeface itself."

  body: "Do those measurements actually apply to the font, both the original and the
    half-sized version?\r\n\r\nBTW, with those measurements, you should have gotten
    this error message when you generated the OTF:\r\n\r\n[WARNING] The feature file
    OS/2 overrides TypoAscender and TypoDescender do not sum to the font bbox size!"

  body: "Those measurements apply to the original version (I used the \"realculate\"
    button). But the measurements of the half-sized version are different, obviously
    because the size is different (or am I missing something).  \r\n\r\nAnd yes I
    get the message for both versions.\r\n\r\nBTW, I forgot to point out that this
    problem (pixels) appear only on size 12 or lower.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

  body: Yes, I confirm - it is a hinting problem (at least the symptoms are the same).
