  your taxes for free online (Of course you never have to pay to file your taxes the
  old fashioned way... I\u2019m just not that committed\u2014or smart).\r\n\r\nBrowse
  these free file recommended companies from IRS:\r\nhttp://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/jsp/index.jsp?ck\r\n\r\nFor
  the most part, to qualify you cannot have earned more than $57,000 (sorry David
  Berlow)\r\n\r\nIf you make under 31,000 you can use the very slick TurboTax Freedom
  Project Edition for your federal taxes, which also allows you to file you state
  taxes for free in the following states AL, AR, AZ, GA, IA, ID, KY, MI, MN, MO, MS,
  NY, NC, ND, OK, OR, RI, SC, VT, WV:\r\nhttp://turbotax.intuit.com/taxfreedom/\r\n\r\nI
  live in California in which state taxes cannot be prepared for free with Turbo Tax.\r\n\r\nI
  checked with the California Franchise Tax Board\r\nhttp://www.ftb.ca.gov/\r\n\r\nIf
  you made under $160,739 (sorry Stephen Coles) you can file your taxes directly the
  State of California. Check with state\u2019s tax board to see of the have a similar
  program.\r\n\r\nThen when you are done preparing your taxes for free and saving
  all kinds of money, think of me while you roll around your bed sensually with your
  fat tax returns :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/indecent_proposal_6540.jpg]\r\n\r\nPerhaps
  you may not qualify (\u2019cause sexy type designers are super rich), but you probably
  know a student, friend, or relative who does. Pass this info on and help a brotha\u2019
  out.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)\r\n\r\nPS... Pay special attention the Earned Income Credit."

    is beacuse I know - and esteem \u2013 you as a regular contributor.\r\nPlease
    explain, where\u2019s the type? This is not Taxophile. Not to mention the improper
    ad hominem remarks.\r\nAnd guess what: most typophiles are not in the US.\r\nF"

  body: "Florian, I am surprised you would think of this as spam. While this isn't
    relevant for most people on Typophile, it does address a rather specific audience
    of people in the creative industry who pay US taxes. I think some of them will
    appreciate the tip. Perhaps it would have been better for Mike to specify these
    were US taxes, and not choose a wording that immediately recalls actual spam or
    pop-up ads, but I don't think it's inappropriate for Typophile.\r\n\r\nI also
    don't see how jokes about some type designers making a lot of money can be considered
    improper ad hominem remarks.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Taxophile sounds really scary."

  body: "Brian, it was not clear to me that this information is directly related to
    the creative industry.\r\nMike, I apologize for my harsh tone, especially concerning
    the jokes -\_maybe I just didn\u2019t get them.\r\n\r\nI still believe that Typophile\u2019s
    General Discussion forum is not the best place for this kind of information. I
    know that there are a lot of other borderline topics, and that hence this rebuke
    hit Mike pretty arbitrarily. I'd like to know how you'd feel if we started discussing
    the finer points of <em>K\xFCnstlersozialkasse</em> here, though. There must be
    other web fora."

    thing in the blog, except that the blogs have disappeared (or at least I don\u2019t
    see that function any more).\r\n\r\nI did say (but not clearly enough) that this
    thread was intended for my \u201Ctype-lovers here in the USA\u201D.\r\n\r\nAnd
    of course I don\u2019t get compensation for writing something like this except
    for the satisfaction of helping my fellow type-lover save a few (US... ha!) dollars.\r\n\r\nMany
    US type designers are freelance. You have pay for your own healthcare etc. Everything
    is out of your pocket. I put this thread up for them.\r\n\r\nI think I should
    the title... any suggestions?\r\n\r\n"
