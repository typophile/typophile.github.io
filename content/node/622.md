body: My boss is looking for a cheap&#40;free&#41; font management tool. Something
  that he can load and unload fonts with. I&#39;ve never even barked up this tree
  so I have no ideas. Has anyone ever heard of or have experience with anything like
  this?

  body: If he&#39;s using OSX, he can simply load and unload them in the users/library/fonts
    folder. That&#39;s free.

  body: I&#39;m on XP, and I typically just use ATM Lite for loading and unloading
    fonts. It&#39;s somewhat extraneous since XP recognizes PostScript, but I find
    it easier than using the Fonts folder. Of course, it doesn&#39;t work with TrueType
    files...

  body: Since when does ATM Light do management?  ATM Light from what I knew only
    allowed you to use postscript. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I don&#39;t have the address handy,
    but look at Printer&#39;s Apprentice.

  body: Neither ATM Lite or Printer&#39;s Apprentice mentions font management in their
    product descriptions. Like Chris said it seems ATM Lite is just for viewing and
    printing fonts. Printer&#39;s apprentice says it can install and uninstall fonts
    but it doesn&#39;t say anything about managing them. Do you just use it to install
    and uninstall fonts instead of doing it manually? Is that all that font management
    software does? I&#39;ve often wondered but have never asked how font management
    software works.

    getting an easier way to install fonts AND the ability to manage fonts in sets

  body: ATM Deluxe is crap if you&#39;re using 2k or XP now.  It&#39;s a dinosaur,
    and it doesn&#39;t play nicely with XP&#39;s internal handling of postscript,
    and it completely overrules fontview for looking at PS fonts.  Everytime you want
    to view a PS font ATM loads itself up and it&#39;s just a pain.  I&#39;ve never
    been able to get fontview working again on PS fonts without a reinstall of windows.
