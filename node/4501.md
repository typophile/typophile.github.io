body: I&#39;m trying to locate yet another face for a customer. Any clues? I though
  I recognized it from a Bauhaus-inspired collection, but it escapes me at the moment.
  The closest similar I&#39;ve found so far is Font Bureau&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/shimano/squareblacknarrow/testdrive.html?s=SUMMIT&amp;p=60">Shimano
  Square Black Narrow</a>, but I need something more serify. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/34451.gif"

  body: Grant are you setting alot of text with this? With its angles, if its just
    a couple of words, a talent like you could bang this out in no time.

  body: Oh, it&#39;s not for me... it&#39;s for a Veer customer wanting to purchase
    some similar. I don&#39;t have any details regarding its usage, I just do IDs
    for our customer service crew when they get stumped. <BR> <BR>However, that&#39;s
    a good idea you had. If the customer isn&#39;t needing much more in terms of additional
    characters, it would be a breeze to whip up.

  body: 'I would have called it Art Deco. BTW, when flipping through the Jaspert book
    for another post, I saw an inclined Roman called &#34;Lunda&#34; that has a lot
    in common with this sample. It was designed in 1941 by K. E. Forsberg, who designed
    Berling. '

  body: Thanks Mike. <BR> <BR>I wish I had more background information on the sample.
    I am going to guess that it was custom drawn, based on either some historical
    reference like you mentioned or perhaps because the designer had a ruler handy.
