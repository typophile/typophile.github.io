body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nhere is a logo I am working on. It is for a girl who is starting
  a website on where she is going to write about modern art exhibitions she has visited.
  'zo zie ik het' is dutch and translated it means 'this is how I see it'.\r\nThe
  logo is portaying a person who is standing in front of a picture/painting and at
  the same time you can read it as an uppercase A. Her first name is Akkemei so this
  seems appropriate. Because she is writing about the art I thought that a handwriting
  typeface (marydale) is too.\r\n\r\nDo you have any comments/critique?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!  "

    go all the way to the outer box to emphasize the 'in front of' angle.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    maybe draw the mark by hand to match the type."

  body: "I like it too; light and clean.\r\n\r\nSticking with the handmade idea, you
    might try actually hand-writing the type and vectorizing it; the feeling of individuality
    could come through stronger that way. It may be clich\xE9 by now but you could
    also play with the dots in zoz<strong>i</strong>e<strong>i</strong>khet<strong>.</strong>nl
    \u2014 they are often ignored but when attention is paid to them it's a nice touch.\r\n\r\nNice
    work; I'm interested to see how it turns out.\r\nDan"

  body: 'My only concern (from a web production perpsective) is the line weight on
    the mark, and the thickness of the typeface itself. If you were going to reduce
    this down to...for example, an avatar of 50x50 or 75x75, would the mark still
    hold? It may loose a little legibility. '

  body: "I like the mark very much as well. Very clever. I do agree with others that
    you need to better communicate the idea of personalized response. \r\n\r\nPlanet
    Propoganda once created a logo for Adams Outdoor Advertising (attached) where
    they combined the idea of an A and a billboard. To convey the idea of customization,
    they interchanged the imagery on the billboards. Hopefully this is inspring. I'm
    not suggesting you rip of Planet Propoganda's mark. \r\n\r\nI look forward to
    watching this evolve. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/61_Adams_Outdoor_1of4.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/61_Adams_Outdoor_2of4.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/61_Adams_Outdoor_3of4.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/61_Adams_Outdoor_4of4.jpg]"
