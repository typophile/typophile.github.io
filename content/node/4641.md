  body: '&#34;MAR&#34; is slightly loose. <BR>&#34;HEALTHCARE&#34; is jutting left;
    and move its &#34;T&#34; to the right. <BR>The bottom line is too lo-fi to tell.

  body: hrant has the right idea.  Rick, look at 2 letter together, with your fingers
    covering the others.  then look at 3 together, then 4, etc... it&#39;s not mathematical,
    just perceptual.  the kerning needs just a little help in LANDMARK, and even more
    help in HEALTHCARE.   <BR> <BR>but what bothers me is the thin part on the R in
    LANDMARK...unless you made more thin parts on other letters...maybe. <BR> <BR>why
    the triangular icon?

  body: You&#39;re getting some good and needed feedback on the kerning, so I&#39;ll
    focus on another issue. Is &#34;connecting health and performance&#34; part of
    this logo unit, or is it a separate element that will be used liberally on varying
    applications? If it is separate I have no issue, but if it is part of the unit
    I think it needs to feel like it is. Right now, it is too distant and lonely.
    <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: Thanks for your feedback on this, here&#39;s version 2. The tagline is a secondary
    element of the logo, not meant to be part of a &#39;unit&#39;. The pyramid is
    to represent, in its most literal sense, a landmark. Also, a compass point, giving
    direction.  <BR> <BR>Any further feedback would be great--Thanks again! <BR> <BR>Rick

  body: RK looks a touch loose to me now. And &#34;Healthcare&#34; still juts a little
    relative to the end of the word.
