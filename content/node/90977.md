  in these two pictures.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/regenata_5703.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Meine_Base_5102.jpg]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
  I don't have better samples but I think the \"Regenata\" sample is pretty particular
  in its characteristics. I am also thinking these typesettings might use alternates
  of a font...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nClemens"
