  What kind of arrangements would you suggest?\r\n\r\n/Kristian"

  body: "Hi Kristian\r\n\r\nThe last time I did this - adapting two 'bespoke' typefaces
    for a London studio in the early 1990s - the entire job was charged out at my
    hourly rate. The completion of the job was the sign-off point at which the studio
    director was satisfied that the resulting fonts were adequate for the studio's
    purposes. I recall that the whole project took about three weeks.\r\n\r\nI'm really
    not sure that this scenario would apply to today's practice for font production;
    for a couple of things, the software is smarter and chargeable man-hours are cheaper.
    Many other people on typophile may have better or more up-to-the-minute advice
    on this. \r\n\r\nIf you believe that there will be a significant difference between
    the time/price you estimate and what you will eventually bill for payment, it
    would be wise to sit down with the client and agree a 'ballpark' figure, i.e.
    the maximum possible invoice amount. This needs to be itemised against the deliverables
    on the project - in this case, three weights of (the roman only?) the new typeface.\r\n\r\nAs
    you don't yet know the full complexity of the project, extras like italics, small
    caps, screen-optimised fonts, condensed styles, extra weights, custom characters,
    ligatures, alternate numerals etc. etc. may get added onto the project, for which
    you should be able to charge 'pro rata' in other words, at your going rate.\r\n\r\nMost
    designers I know now insist on scheduled installments on a project - both for
    supply of the deliverables and payments. Setting all this out in advance should
    help you and your client come to a detailed understanding of what will be involved."

  body: "If you are designing the three fonts from scratch figure out how much time
    it will take and what your hourly rate is. A discussion here a year or so ago
    covered some of this. \r\n\r\nIf you figure the average typeface can take 3 or
    4 weeks working full time, what does that come out to, based on your hourly rate.
    (and please figure on a real hourly rate, one that it would take to run your business,
    not some figure you would be happy to get pushing pixels on someone else's workstation,
    in someone else's studio) \r\n\r\nThat's for the first font, now you have two
    more. If you haven't done this sort of work before I think it will take you longer
    than these time estimates.\r\n\r\nWhat are the licensing issues? Will the client
    own exclusive rights to the work, or will you be able to offer it to others?\r\n\r\nDon't
    sell this work cheap. It takes a lot of time to create a quality font."

  body: "James is right; better not to underprice this project. Of course he points
    out that working from scratch, and possibly for the first time, on this will be
    very time-consuming and labour-intensive. \r\n\r\nKristian, your initial post
    makes it sound like the character shapes for this new typeface are already decided,
    and you will be responsible for generating three weights of the roman. \r\n\r\nI
    should add that this is more-or-less what happened in that 90s project I mentioned
    \u2013 and I've edited my earlier post to explain this better. I generated just
    the regular weight of the romans (no italics! no extra characters!) from two designs
    that already existed as rubylith masters; both of them were bastardised forms
    of typefaces better known by other names. There is no way I could have generated
    the characters from scratch within that timeframe. \r\n\r\nAt a rough guess, the
    three weeks work at that rate was about \xA36 \u2013 7k. This means that the commissioning
    studio had budgeted more than \xA33k per font; although that might sound expensive,
    I recall that they planned to leverage much more value of work out of these particular
    typefaces after the project was completed, so for them it appeared as a reasonable
    investment."

    doesn't sound expensive at all. Maybe for the early 90s but certainly not now.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: James I think it was a reasonable rate for the early 90s; I was happy to do
    the work, but much has changed since. I'm sure that you and the other typophiles
    have a much better idea about current pricing and workflow practices.
