  a decorative joined script like Mistral it might be more obvious to do so, but I
  actually think there&#39;s a lot of other potential in using a centerline. The Ancient
  Greeks for one used the centerline method - and here it&#39;s interesting to note
  that Carter&#39;s Skia has some &#34;centered-ness&#34; to it. <BR> <BR>hhp

    <BR>Or perhaps I misunderstood you -- I was thinking quasi-experimental display
    type here; a typeface with a centerline &#42;instead&#42; of a baseline. <BR>
    <BR>Anyway I was just thinking out loud. It sounded like an interesting idea.
    Does anyone know of a serifed, or semiserifed, typeface using a centerline but
    no baseline? '

    <BR>Yeah, that&#39;s what I meant. <BR> <BR>In a serif face, you might have to
    prevent the serifs from creating imaginary lines, not just on the baseline, but
    elsewhere too &#40;as &#91;I thought&#93; you were hinting&#41;. <BR> <BR>Experimental?
    Sure. <BR>Hopeless? For a serif face, probably, but who knows; for a sans, maybe
    not at all hopeless. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: Hey Hrant, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve designed many a font that are aligned on a centerline
    but bumped down to where they should sit on a baseline to set well. <BR> <BR>For
    playful display faces, considered animated or bouncing on a baseline. Each character
    is designed to play off the counter of the the next one. I think Randumhouse by
    House really is the king of this technique. <BR> <BR>For as nice as you can make
    a display face on a besline, by altering the baseline position, it is able to
    bring another level to the font. A certain planned randumness. This technique
    works especially well for script or connecting faces but works for serif or sans
    serif versions. <BR> <BR>There is a site called <A HREF="http://www.pixeldecor.com/"
    TARGET="_top">Pixel Decor</A> that uses my Pink Flamingo typeface. This will offer
    some example of a serifed face looks in centerline use. My <A HREF="http://www.fontdiner.com/fdtdfont04.gif"
    TARGET="_top">Spaceman font</A> does the same but the letters are cleaner. <BR>

    <BR>Thanks a million for that link Hrant! It cleared up some problems that I&#39;ve
    had lately...Extensive type design info always feel good. Not that I needed the
    centerline design of characters info &#40;even though it was interesting&#41;,
    but the rest was really good <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: ' There are some basic ideas that I apply to adjusting the distance from the
    baseline in relation to the entire typeface. <BR> <BR>In the old days, I used
    to move all the characters together in one long string and select all and align
    vertically. Where I found an oddball, I&#39;d just move it up or down. <BR> <BR>As
    I played more with this technique, I&#39;d move all the characters together in
    one long string and manually position them up or down to see which shapes filled
    the counters of other shapes well. <BR> <BR>The next evolution was discovering
    which letters seemed to affect the &#34;bounce&#34; but showed up consistently
    enough in the typeface as I set copy with it. To no surprise, it was the vowels.
    <BR> <BR>Once I had a good understanding how to adjust the bounce of the font,
    I began working through each glyph in the typeface to exaggerate the bounce even
    further by making some letters taller, some smaller, raise the stems on some,
    lower the stems on others, and repositioning each glyph to further exaggerate
    the face while creating a consistent flow and color with the counters. <BR> <BR>At
    some point, by studying more animated styles, it became second nature to start
    my initial glyph drawings with a bounce in mind. The left and right sides were
    often looked at closely to see how they may interact with the rest of the face
    and often readjusted several times throughout the construction of the face. <BR>
