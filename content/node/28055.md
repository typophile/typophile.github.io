  it up yet. I am trying to work for myself as a commercial letterist. Anyone out
  ther currently doing this? Do you enjoy it? I have made three fonts so far (Sarah
  Script, Bounce script and avalanche) I am hoping to one day make it as a fulltime
  letterist.\r\n\r\nAny advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. :)\r\n\r\n-Charles

  body: That's beautiful lettering. Maybe the very thinnest lines should be beefed
    up just slightly though? I'm not a hand letterer myself.

    you should work with corporate identities, I think there's a lack of really skilled
    brush script people."

    with him and ask how to find these types of jobs. the book <em>[[logo_font_and_lettering_bible|Logo,
    Font & Lettering Bible]]</em> also has a business section on how to market yourself
    as a lettering artist.'
