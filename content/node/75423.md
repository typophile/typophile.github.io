  to find a font to work with the symbol, \r\ncan anyone suggest anything that might
  work better than this?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nToby"

  body: Do you think the A isn't strong enough in the symbol then?

  body: Put it centered above, then the 'A' might become more apparent, and less as
    an initial swash cap 'N'

  body: "Is it to be pronounced *alternative*?  I think the monogram is a nice concept,
    but the execution doesn't have enough A in it.  Maybe if the crossbar was more
    horizontal?\r\n\r\nIs this fashion photography, yearbook portraits, wedding photography,
    or art photos?  Maybe try to get inside the personality and focus of the company,
    and let that come thru the mark more.  "

  body: "Thanks for your comments,\r\nYeah its mainly wedding and portrait photography,
    I think they went for a play on words with the *altar* alternative thing.\r\n\r\nI
    tried joining up the A crossbar but it don't think it looked quite as good"

  body: The AN mark is nice, but I think the Alter Native type is too decorative with
    the mark. It's too much.
