    In \"everyone\" the o_n is a ligature, but in \"ends sunday\" the 2 n are the
    same.\r\n\r\nThe \"e\": Are the same in the first and last in \"everyone\"; In
    \"loves\" and in \"end\", but are different in \"s_e\" and \"c_r_e\" in secret,
    and in \"e_r\" in \"everyone\".\r\n\r\nThe \"s\": In \"secret\" is a \"s_e\" ligature;
    but the in \"ends\", \"sunday\" and \"ends\" are the same.\r\n\r\nI don't look
    handwritten to me, since the connections don't look good in:\r\n\"ev\" in everyone\r\n\"yo\"
