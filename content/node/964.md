    think its exact to make a top of number of answers, because, sometimes, the answers
    need to be multiple. I remember the post from Kent: 6 or 8 quiz in same time to
    answer. I&#39;m sure there is others. <BR> <BR> <BR>2. The numbers of wrong answers
    by quiz is a good indication of difficulty of it and interesting too. <BR> <BR>
    <BR>Anyway, sorry if seems a critic, it is not, just some throughs. And saddly
    I don&#39;t have time to do it myself. Thanks again'

    those multiple ID challenges to the &#34;score-board&#34;. &#40;see below&#41;
    <BR>About your second comment, I think it would be very interesting too, but I&#39;m
    afraid it would be really hard to check every wrong guess posted.

  body: 'what about it.... <BR> <BR>the &#34;fun competition&#34; &#40;for me&#41;
    comes from trying to figure <BR>it out first. I found it fun two turns ago to
    recognize <BR>neuland right away, but to lose the ID because I couldn&#39;t <BR>nail
    down which one. To see the email red dot as I was fussing  <BR>with P22s typecaster,
    that was fun and yes, <BR>a bit of a thrill. <BR> <BR>this fun competion exists
    whether someone tallies or <BR>not, for me. <BR> <BR>i didn&#39;t say don&#39;t
    tally the winners, I said that <BR> <BR>a&#41; jfp&#39;s suggestion was illogical
    &#40;my opinion&#41; <BR>b&#41; if there&#39;s no tally, I&#39;m not going to
    cry about it <BR>c&#41; in my opinion, the tallying takes away the fun &#40;for

    <BR>not the Type ID board, which is a different animal. But I don&#39;t make <BR>the

    <BR>hrant, it seems as if your interest was renewed by the <BR>leaderboard. So
    if that&#39;s the case, there&#39;s another <BR>good reason to keep the tallies
    going: to keep the interest. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>'

    or <BR>something - it&#39;s not, in fact it&#39;s great mental exercise <BR>and
    good socializing - it&#39;s just to make my time-management <BR>a little less
