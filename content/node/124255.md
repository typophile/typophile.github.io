  body: "Edited:\r\nThis clunkly blackletter was sold in Britain and the U.S. as Tudor
    Black. \r\nIt was a very common font. Even the Economist Magazine used it for
    headings in the early 20th century. The design dates from the 19th century when
    it was created as as a Victorian romantic Gothic revival with little basis in
    historic blackletter other than some inspiration from Spanish rotunda. I have
    been unable to determine the name of the designer or the original date of the
    typeface design, whether named Tudor Black or Psalter Gotisch. Also I don't know
    which came before the other.\r\nThere is some variation in some of the capital
    letters among the versions sold by various foundries. The Edinburgh Press probably
    used the Miller and Richard Blake version [img:sites/default/files/old-images/TudorBlack@MillerAndRichard_3943.jpg]
    although it could perhaps be the one from Stephenson Blake. Miller and Richard
    even created an italic version -- a blackletter monstrosity.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks so much to all who helped!\r\n\r\nI wonder, if one were to pursue
    its sub-identification even further, would it be a clue that the descender of
    the \"y\" is very heavy and almost unmodulated in stroke width?\r\n\r\nTo me,
    this characteristic most distinguishes this variant from the sample provided by
    Don, the sample of Psalter Gotisch, and the sample on the Type Heritage thread.\r\n\r\nMore
    subtly, the cross-bar (sorry if that is the wrong term) of the \"e\" seems more
    severely angled than any of the samples."

  body: "As I said, every foundry had a version, sometimes more than one. The design
    had a long run and there were plenty of opportunities for tinkering to avoid accusations
    of piracy.\r\nAlso there was no guarantee that different point sizes would have
    the same design. They were often cut separately by hand rather than by mechanical
    scaling. The smaller scale versions of complex typefaces -- and this one is not
    simple -- had to be simplified to deal with the problems of using metal type.\r\nDon"
