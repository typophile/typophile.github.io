body: "I'm fascinated by the numeral 4 in this publication, but I can't identify what
  the typeface is. I've checked the usual suspects, but unless there's some kind of
  opentype alternate glyphs hiding in some variant of Trade or the like, I've no idea
  what it is. It's the face 14 and 58 are set in here (rather fond of the 8 too).
