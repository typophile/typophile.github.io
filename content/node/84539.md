body: "Not sure if this is the correct place and what the conventions are for showcasing
  your font, but here we go. I've put together a few files to show the font. The first
  one only shows 3 weights in more detail but there are in fact 4. I've (hand)drawn
  all glyphs in illustrator, they are basically monolined and meant to be pretty close
  to one another. Bold and italic/slanted versions have been generated with the help
  of FontLab although I had to redraw a number of glyphs (I realise it's probably
  bad form to have FontLab generate a bold and italic version for you...) Maybe I've
  put the glyphs a bit too close in kerning, not sure.\r\n\r\nSuggestions welcome

  body: I would straighten up the vertical stroke of K. It seems like the sort of
    thing that would stand out more the more times you see it, especially in all-caps
    use. It doesn't need changing in the swash K, though.

  body: "Lower the crossbar of /4/ to give the counter more space.\r\nTop counter
    of /a/ also looks a little cramped.\r\nDid you consider connecting the crossbars
    on those ligatures?\r\nI think the swashy cap alternates are out of character.\r\nBold
    still needs more cleaning up. Allow it to depart from monoline (for example at
    the joins) more.\r\nThose \"historical\" ligatures strike me as a goofy inclusion
    in a typeface like this. But I like the \"Ti\" \"Tj\" treatment a lot.\r\n/Z/
    may be wide. /W/ could come up further in the middle. /S/ may be trying to hard
    to hit horizontal in the spine.\r\nI like the crossbar on /7/."

  body: "great feedback so far guys!\r\n\r\n@cerulean: good point about the K, seeing
    it next to the M like in the bottommost image it's indeed a bit too curvy. I don't
    want to drop that curviness too much, i want it to stay a little loose. But it
    could definitely use some work, so thanks!\r\n\r\n@eliason: thanks for all those
    constructive points! the /a/ is definitely a character i've been struggling with.
    if i move the top part upwards it becomes too high (have tried that before) making
    it stand out way too much in regard to the other lower cases. I'll have to try
    out some more options there.\r\n\r\n\"Did you consider connecting the crossbars
    on those ligatures?\" << which ones do you mean?\r\n\r\nI do realise that most
    of the ligatures might seem out of place since they are old fashioned, but i thought
    it would be fun. plus, most of them are discretionary ligatures, so people can
    leave them out. Same for the swash capitals. It's a bit of a tricky decision maybe,
    since I am in fact including them and then saying \"hey if you don't like them
    you can leave them out\". Not sure if that is a good call but as for now I think
    I'll leave them?\r\n\r\nWhat I currently have as standard ligatures: /ffi/ffj/ffl/fft/ff/fi/fj/fl/ft/tt/Tij/Tji/Th/Ti/Tj/\r\nAll
    the others are discretionary ligatures.\r\nI did one odd thing: i made an alternative
    st ligature (where the top of the /s/ is connected to the crossbar of the /t/)
    and this ligature I added as a contextual alternate that supposedly only works
    at the start of words. Hence in the middle of a word the st is replaced by an
    old fashioned ligature, but at the start of a word (if users want that) it can
    be replaced by a different one. Does this make sense at all?\r\n\r\nNow that you
    mention it I see that /Z/ /W/ and /S/ could use some work.\r\n\r\nThe bold variant
    is something i probably need to put some proper time in, to make it better. After
    getting fontlab to create a bolder version I did redo about 1/3 of the glyphs
    as they were messy. Some more contrast (that is what you suggest I think?) might
    be good indeed to strengthen the bold effect.\r\n\r\nThanks so far for all the
    feedback!\r\n\r\nAnd thanks (bedankt!) as well Tim!"

    they looked a bit odd. At the moment the space in between the crossbars might

    the /ft/ looked like an alternative /A/\r\n\r\nSee them here:\r\n<img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6134/6008067117_6e2eff1567.jpg\">\r\n<img

  body: "The reason the swash characters aren't working is because they break from
    the monoline-ness of the rest of the font.  Keep the swashes but don't have them
    tapering to a point as they are now, but keep the basic skeleton and have the
    ends of the swashes basically the same as the ends of all other stems.  Another
    thing that jumped out at me - you single curly quotes are like 6 and 9, so your
    double curly quotes should be like 66 and 99.  At the moment they are mirrored
    99 and 99.\r\nOverall it's looking like a nice alternative to Kristen and (dare
    I say it) Comic Sans."

    the swashes, couldn't put my finger on it but as you say, this is what makes them
    a bit out of style.\r\n\r\nGood catch too about the single vs double quotes -
    my bad!\r\n\r\nAnd yes, after having created the lower case letters (I started
    out with the upper case letters) I did realise it started to look a bit like comic
    sans indeed. Part of me says \"ouch\" but on the other hand I do feel it's different
    and might serve a purpose.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the constructive criticism so
    far! "

    And the original unconnected ones really are the most effective for reading.

  body: Thanks cerulean, that's a good point. I could upen up those /f/s at the top
    if i connect the crossbar. Leaning towards what you say though, keep the leftmost
    option as they seem somewhat more legible than the other ones - even though those
    on the right aren't that bad looking at all ;)

    that you just want to release it and see what happens.  Posters look great - good
    luck with it!

  body: For what it's worth, I'd have the poster with the bird as the first one.  It
    looks really good and shows more how the font would be used.  I also see you've
    not made a flag yet.  I've seen a few foundries do a flag that doesn't actually
    show the font.  I think it's a clever way of getting people to click on the flag
    - just to see what it is, and I think your bird image could make an excellent
    flag.  Of course, the only time anyone sees the flag without the font by its side
    is when it's a Hot New Font on the homepage, so I guess it has to be successful
    first before this marketing trick pays off!

  body: "Hey Dave,\r\n\r\nthanks for all your feedback and comments! I was off for
    a few days, which is why I didn't respond any sooner. As you said, I'm quite eager
    to get it out there as this is my first typeface. If I understood correctly I
    can update the files with a newer version (some user feedback might help there
    too) and people will be able to download the newer version.\r\n\r\nI've been struggling
    a bit with the tail of the Q, as I tried to follow the angle of the  original
    dash (it's not a crossbar is it?). Might be better to move it downwards a bit
    (so maybe in the next update?).\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback on the posters
    as well! Is there a way to set which one is the first? I bet there is. Might work
    very well to put the bird first. Most of the posters I did were just designed
    with \"show the options\" in mind, but in reality most people will probably use
    it more in the way as I did with the bird (so useful feedback there, thanks).\r\n\r\nHow
    did you see/know this by the way? Is there some secret way to see upcoming fonts
    at myfonts?"
