body: Hello Gang, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to be writing a 1,500 word term paper on
  Biambattista Bodoni. I&#39;ve thought about setting the type in Bodoni but the contrast
  of the typeface dazzles the eyes. What would be an appropriate typeface for a text
  about Bodoni? What would be an appropriate style for designing the page? thanks.

  body: I&#39;m not sure as I never used it, but I think ITC Bodoni 12 &#40;or even
    6&#41; would be a good choice.

  body: my original idea was to NOT use bodoni. are these versions of bodoni optomized
    for use in body copy? i have ITC bodoni but it doesnt look too great when i set
    an entire paper with it. too much contrast in the letters! is there another typeface
    that i could use that wont be irrelevant to Bodoni himself?

  body: 'What about a Didot?  ;-&#62; <BR> <BR>Actually, some Bodonis &#40;like the
    ITC - but make sure you use the &#34;12&#34; version, or maybe even the &#34;6&#34;
    at like 10 point&#41; work OK for short text. But if you wanted a highly readable
    font that&#39;s related, try a Baskerville: that was Giambatista&#39;s original
    inspiration. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Hrant, I&#39;d need my notes from James Mosley&#39;s lectures, but I am pretty
    sure you are not right about Giambattista&#39;s inspiration. What is your source
    for that information?  <BR>

  body: While I was researching those funky Deberny fonts &#40;see the Javal thread&#41;,
    I read up on all the &#34;transitional&#34; material I have handy, and I think
    all of them &#40;or at least those that go into any depth about Bodoni&#41; mention
    that he was basically enamored with Baskerville&#39;s work. He even tried to make
    a trip to Britain to meet him in person, but fell ill along the way. My references
    would include Lawson&#39;s &#34;Anatomy&#34; for example. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    Design</i>. Shortly prior to his moving to Parma. <BR> <BR>[erm, that&#39;s <i>Bodoni&#39;s</i>
    moving to Parma - not Meggs.]

    me of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1307.jhtml" target="_blank">
    Bulmer</a>. Any chance that&#39;d work?

  body: I really think you should have another look at ITC Bodoni 12 and 6. Just make
    sure it&#39;s well leaded on a reasonable measure.

  body: Did you ever try Linotype Gianotten? It&#39;s designed for text in smaller
    sizes and has a far lower contrast. The light version even has Small Caps! Antonio
    Pace created Gianotten in 1999. The Milana Citta is a modified version for the
    house style of the city of Milan. <BR>see <a href="http://www.linotype.com" target="_blank">www.linotype.com</a>
