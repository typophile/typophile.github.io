    don't remember coming across this one.

  body: I think it is hand-drawn, but it looks similar to ITC's <cite><a href="http://www.linotype.com/1291/oldenglish-family.html">Old
    English</a></cite>, which is common and inexpensive. It is also not so much an
    accurate recreation of any particular Blackletter as a rather stylized hodge-modge.

  body: "No I don't have it yet, Stephen invited me to help out with cross-referencing.
    Which means I had PDFs and a humongous database at my disposal and stared myself
    blind over type showings for a week or so, checking if one typeface looks similar
    to another one, times a gazillion.\r\n\r\nSo if you find any dud references in
    the Sans, Slab or Blackletter section, it's all my fault, I'm so sorry, I'll never
    do it again, we had to work under crushing deadlines yadda yadda. Stephen's did
    Script and Serif, but his absolute masterpiece is the Display section."
