  body: Where will this be used? If it is anything that might be seen in different
    lighting situations and still be usable at a distance I would suggest using a
    different color. Black and red both read as basically the same tone. Especially
    bad on bus boards and billboards.

    possible to varnish the black. Or you use a very dark green to recieve s.th.  like
    a \"complementary color contrast\" effect.\r\n\r\n>You could leave the cyan at

    it, can you explain"

  body: "If you bring cyan into the rich black and it is not a component of the red
    you could potentially get a visible edge or halo where the cyan plate was visible.
    One way to trap process is to include 20% or so of only the colors that exist
    in the adjacent color.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=21092&seqNum=5\r\n\r\nThat
    forest green to florescent red look will make you ill. I've never know two colors
    that could flash so hard."

    mixed the red to a more orangey color (maybe 0 80 90 0) you have a better fighting
    chance. Of course that is probably not possible.\r\n\r\npbc"

    Any issues I should look out for?"

    It's kinda frustrating. Thanks for all your advices!\r\n\r\nWierd question: Should
    I cut a hole shaped like the logo from my red background if I don't want to mix
    the two inks?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "my approach can be unorthodox, but i've had success taking advantage of undercolors
    to enhance overcolors,  so without a knock-out you could \r\nadd cyan or other
    available red-opposites to the black, \r\nmaking it a hybrid rich-black which
    utilizes the red underneath. \r\n\r\ndepends on ink & paper of course; requires
    physical proof. "

  body: "For spots, just over print the black over whatever lighter color. Color only
    match (more or less depending the pressman...) if printed against white, even
    for the black. For 4 color jobs when having heavy black solids the best is useing
    the rich black. If you are not sure, you can always ask for a proof. Proofing
    now a days is pretty affordable, and you can always ask the printer, these guys
    know a big bunch about it. :)\r\n\r\n"

    today with a 100C 100M red background and black text over the top. As it is a
    press ad I am very worried about the registration and want to avoid white halos.
    It is set in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the best trap settings?"
