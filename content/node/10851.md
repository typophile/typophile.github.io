body: Hmmm. <BR>Well actually, my Enschede specimen is the 1908, and it shows no attribution
  for that font... but looking at the rest of the table I thought maybe by 1978 &#40;the
  date of your specimen&#41; they could safely conclude it was Sabon - the &#34;petit
  romain grec&#34; attributed to Sabon was sold in the same year to the same customer.
  BTW, the 1908 shows no other font at all with a &#34;gamma-upsilon-nu&#34; ligature
  &#40;unless I missed it&#41;. <BR> <BR>So I <i>kinda</i> guessed. What&#39;s my
  punishment? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I&#39;ll need to check my source next time I&#39;m in the office, but I&#39;m
    pretty sure that this brevier Greek was cast from Granjon&#39;s original, not
    Sabon&#39;s version. It is the smallest size of Granjon&#39;s St Augustine Grec.

    actually had a bunch of previous names, including &#34;Galaxy&#34; &#40;no joke&#41;.
    But the main one cited as Frutiger&#39;s own choice is &#34;Monde&#34;. But the
    font house &#40;D&amp;P&#41; wanted something more international. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    funny that people think of Univers as neutral. I think of it as Barbarella. <BR>

  body: I think Hrant&#39;s right about Univers, but his Helvetica answer is apparently
    a guess. Helvetica&#39;s original name was Neue Haas Grotesk. I don&#39;t know
    why it was changed, though.

  body: I&#39;ve always thought that Stempel named it Helvetica in...homage I suppose...to
    the Swiss and to Swiss design. At the time, perhaps still, the Swiss postage stamps
    said Helvetica &#40;Latin for Switzerland&#41;. And, I believe that Hoffman at
    the HAAS foundry was actually surprised that Stempel named the font after Switzerland.
