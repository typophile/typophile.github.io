    what order\" is too much. You can still read it by scrambling the letters randomly
    inside a word, but there's some tricks to making it so that the reading speed
    will be normal or close to it. Ascenders and descenders should stay in the same
    place or close, and the same for wide or narrow letters. \r\n\r\nNow everyone
