  body: "The problem is not the angle but the fact that the text is too small to identify
    or even verify the identification.\r\nI can say e.g. this is <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=MS-Windows-Fonts%20%2F%20%28Commercial%29&ffam=Century%20Gothic%20-%20Regular&fid=cfce6abbbff0099b15691345d8b94dcc&fsize=48&text=METEORIT%203-PACK%20VYKORT%20MED%20KUVERT&wrap=2|Century
    Gothic]]</strong>.\r\nIt's quite close, but if you don't have a better (hi-res)
    sample of the text you 'll never be sure."
