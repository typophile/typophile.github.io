  mark\u2010to\u2010base and mark\u2010to\u2010mark positioning (I think) and I was
  wondering if there was an easy way to use these positing data when generating AAT
  tables? I'm rather a novice at this so any help along these lines would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\u2013
  Nicholas."

    would an Armenian\r\nletter show up if it didn't?\r\n\r\nHere's a grab of what
    I'm seeing:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/errant-ra.gif]\r\n\r\nYou know
    what's really spooky? In my old custom Armenian\r\n8-bit encoding (which of course
    couldn't possibly have any\r\nrole here) the ra is mapped to the... hyphen!!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    character is U+2010 HYPHEN, which is mapped to the key between zero and equals."
