  regarding priorities.\r\nFor my phone-number I'm unsure whether or not I should
  use Berling Antikva, which comes from my home-country Sweden or if I should choose
  a face with titling numerals, like Adobe Garamond Pro.\r\n\r\nI was curious to see
  the general consensus here on Typophile, what would be more important to you personally?\r\n\r\nFor
  reference here is Berling: http://www.identifont.com/samples/ef/Berling.gif\r\nAnd
  Adobe Garamond Pro: http://www.prepressure.com/images/dict_old_style_numerals.png"

    letterpress Berling, making up for the lack of titling.\r\nStill, a big thank
    you!"

  body: 'I think phone numbers can work well in osf, but it is a matter of preference.
    If the osfs are too far off from the lining figs they have a tendency to draw
    attention to themselves. In any case, I wouldn''t give up on Swedish faces: Fountaintype
    have some alternatives.'
