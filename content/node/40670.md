body: "This question might rub a few of you wrong, but if you have an answer please
  share.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to add a drop shadow to an object in InDesign CS3. (Object>Effects>Drop
  Shadow), I know this much. The object is a vector graphic imported from Illustrator.
  I'm curious if I can change the resolution of the drop shadow, much like you can
  in Illustrator (hence the Document Raster Effect Setting reference in the title).
  Currently when viewing the design at high quality, the drop shadow looks very bitmapped.
  I'd like to change the resolution if I can, but I don't know where to start.\r\n\r\nAny
  help will be appreciated. However, please refrain from sharing your opinions for
  or against the use of drop shadows, they will not be appreciated."

    may have Object Level Display turned on or the linked file may be missing.
