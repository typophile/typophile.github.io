body: I just saw the movie "Fences".  I thought the credits were in Trajan, but I'm
  not hard core enough to be sure.   Definitely had the skinny "L"s, and I don't think
  I saw any lowercase.  Anyone here seen the movie?  The trailers and static ads I've
  seen don't use it (mostly sans plus some Didone).  Thanks.
