  aware that several font families have optical size designs (e.g. Paperback, Beorcana,
  Freight), but that doesn't guarantee that the fonts have a 'size' feature.\r\n\r\nSo
  if you know of fonts \u2014 again, other than Adobe's fonts \u2014 that have that
  feature, please announce them here. Thanks."
