  Century Schoolbook Font. \r\n\r\nthe images are very rich, and think maybe something
  more \"blobby\" would work. I would really appreciate advice on the font choice,

    someone should check whether Comic Sans may have homogenised the lettering of

    course.\r\n\r\nThis \u201Ccloisonn\xE9/coloring book\u201D technique of illustration

    as printed letters. That doesn't mean they can't be perceived as beautiful.  Many
    people, especially parents, may find children's drawings to have some kind of
    beauty in their own right.  Now I think it shouldn't be forbidden to show such
    pieces of beauty or wake associations with them by similarly-styled drawings or
    fonts.  An image like that reminds me of the fun children have scribbling and
    drawing and of their creativity.  It doesn't remind me of limited abilities.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, that doesn't mean these associations are appropriate in every case that
    involves children.  It may be that such \"childish\" fonts are used too often.
    \ But still, I think it's perfectly acceptable to use them if they fit the topic.
    \ Just as it's acceptable to use imperfect adult handwriting fonts in some cases!"

    terrible.\r\nThat was also the sentiment of artists such as Picasso and Klee,
    who sought to capture some of its naive quality in their own work.\r\n\r\nBut
    a font like Besley is a poor emulation, most obviously because it has no \u201Cpseudo-random\u201D
    quality.\r\nFor instance, it makes no sense that the glyphs are supposedly imprecisely
    drawn, and yet you get two /l\u2019s together that are absolutely identical! \r\nAnd
    everything adhering to rigid baselines.\r\nIt\u2019s a travesty of what it purports
    to represent (unless the typographer goes in manually to bounce, rotate, and scale
    letters so that they vary each time).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s purpose in a book like
    this is to signal \u201Cthis is for children\u201D, not \u201Cthis is to be read
    by children\u201D.\r\n\r\nThe bad writing of adults, whether innate or feigned,
    is quite a different thing than the emerging ability of a child.\r\n\r\nWhy not
    hand-letter or hand write the text, or get a child to do that?\r\n"
