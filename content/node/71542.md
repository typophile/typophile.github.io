body: "Hey, I've been searching high and low for a step by step guide to truetype
  hinting in Fontlab but the best I've found is how to autohint.\r\nSo I've gotten
  this far:\r\n1. Convert curves to truetype\r\n2. Paths > Set TT Direction\r\n3.
  Convert Hints to links\r\n   That IS the right process, right?\r\nFrom there, is
  there a logical order to go through? Align, then single links, then double links,
  etc?\r\n   I think what I might really be looking for is a description of How the
  tools work rather than what they do. For instance, when I link one side of a line
  to the other side is that meant to line the pixels up between the link, the way
  hints work? It doesn't always seem to work that way\r\n   I assume the align tool
  is supposed to align a point on the contour with its corresponding point on the...
  other contour, but it's pretty unpredictable as to which point its going to gravitate
  toward. Seems to move away from the point I'm clicking on as often as it aligns
  to it. I wonder if I'm using it incorrectly.\r\n\r\n   Not sure at all what to do
  about rounding and when to pick which method.\r\n\r\nI keep finding sentences like
  this in the manual that are referring to a \"another command,\" but can't find what
  that \"other\" command is: \r\n\"The single link connects an outline point to a
  point whose position is set by another command. If you set a single link that linked
  point will always be at the given distance from the base point:\" \r\nOh, the base
  point the first point, right?\r\n\r\n   In the manual's instructions on how to use
  double links it essentially says not to use them because they're unpredictable.
  OK. Why do they exist?\r\n\r\n   If I can get some answers on these questions I'll
  compile it into an article. I keep seeing people online who are completely miffed
  at the process and need simpler instructions(I may be the most clueless of them)
  so I'll post it here or the Fontlab forum.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help that comes
  swooping in."

    for hinting, starts I think, with knowing that it's based on a stack and a graphics
    state (both of which are poorly documented, I think). This you should also understand,
    that before either your stack of hand made or auto hints begins to act when the
    OS calls for a font of some ppm size, that the TT OS software has 'hinted' the
    em top and bottom, located the baseline in pixel space, as well as the origin
    and the set width of each glyph (undocumented). Then one has to understand that
    no point moves properly unless its movement is relative to another point (documented
    nowhere I've read). Then the instructions you or the auto-hinter make, start from
    the origin point and work into the glyph's points, using the origin as a basis
    for the rounding of one (or more) of the points on the glyph, from which the instructions
    further down the stack round the other points.\r\n\r\nIt would be so cool if the
    folks who were flogging this auto-hinting process would show one proof that it
    is useful for more than \"sloppy work\" but I'm not holding your breath. I think,
    in case you can't tell, that knowing \"what they do\" is pretty important if you
    want to know \"how the tools work.\" \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "David, in FLS autohinting is a two-step process. First, it analyses outline
    and generates type 1 hints, then it converts type 1 hints into \"visual instructions\"
    which you can see and edit in TT hinting mode. In between is a step of generation
    and optimization of font-level hints (zones and stems). \r\n\r\nLast and final
    step is conversion of \"visual instructions\" into native TT hinting code. All
    intermediate steps are visible and very simple to check."

  body: "Dberlow: \r\n\"Then the instructions... start from the origin point and work
    into the glyph's points\"\r\nam I right in thinking that while manually hinting
    you might be better off if you take into account a path across the glyph starting
    at--say 0,0--rather than jumping around?\r\n\r\nYuri: that's one of the things
    I cant figure out - I get my type 1 hinting tweaked just right, then convert them
    to instructions and end up with a mess somehow. I wonder if my problem starts
    in that in-between step. I've been using the auto-generated stem values carried
    over from the type 1 hinting - especially in the font I'm working on right now,
    which is hollow\r\n\r\nIt's incredible how hard it is to get a couple pixels to
    line up correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    18. It looks a billion times better, but only at 18 and above, so I guess hinting
    at all is working against me here.

  body: "Db: \"I'm not sure how else to do it\"\r\nWell, what I was doing was not
    paying any attention to the linear order of problems I was attempting to fix,
    so I was jumping back and forth across the glyph, sort of like playing Whack-a-mole.
    But, in comparing what the autohinting is doing to my own instructions I may be
    even more wrong in my approach - I've been linking 2 points, then in a completely
    disconnected operation linking two others. On the other hand, the generated instructions
    always seem to have the links working in back to back operations so that one begins
    where the last ended.\r\n\r\nYuri: Never noticed the \"[gasp]\" in that menu title...
    thought you were being sarcastic :)\r\nI just happened to find the setting by
    mistake in the TT Hinting Options General tab and messed with it to see what would
    happen.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely an uphill battle, so much to learn."

    stack begins with reference to the origin point 0,0, as this is rounded by the
    font software before the hints begin. Then the instructions are an orderly march
    across the glyph, and/or an orderly march up from 0 to the top of the glyph and
    down from 0 to any descent. \r\n\r\nIf your reference points and march are not
    orderly, and the stack is just running around moving points in no pattern, then
