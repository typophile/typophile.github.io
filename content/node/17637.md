  my first job (non-profit). And when I went to a printers web site I saw their requirments
  for printing, and I'm a little lost. \r\n\r\n  They ask that the file be PDF, and
  have bleed and trim marks. I know how to do all that, but I am lost as to how you
  set it up for a printer. For example, how big do I make the page inorder for them
  to see the bleed? So if my bleed is 3mm, and my card is 90mm x 55mm, then does that
  mean I make the page 93mm x 58mm? IS that how it works? And I assume the trim line
  is just be a box marking the trim with a .25pt line thickness.\r\n\r\nSorry if these
  questions are really stupid and sound very noobie, but I want to get it right.\r\n\r\nThank
  You"

  body: Your assumptions are correct about the bleeds and the trim. Pretty simple
    stuff. If the shop is halfway decent they'll let you know if they have any problems
    with the file.

  body: "It is probably best to use InDesign, where you can set the document size
    (trim), margins (live area) and bleed in the \"Document Setup.\" CS 2 will also
    allow you to export a press-ready PDF/X-1A with the appropriate color profile
    embedded.\r\n\r\nBut whichever app you set-up your file in, do not put a box around
    your trim. It will be extremely difficult for your printer to cut directly on
    a .25pt line\_\u2013 that's what a bleed is for \u2013 an area for the printer
    to safely cut within.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal to know about making files
    press-ready. <a href=\"http://www.sappi.com/NR/rdonlyres/58071E52-0EB0-4F34-886F-6CB1CC85FE0F/0/TheStandard1_Prepress.pdf\">The
    Standard</a>, which is published by Sappi, is a great place to start. Sappi also
    has more advanced informational brochures available <a href=\"http://www.sappi.com/SappiWeb/Knowledge%20bank/Technical%20brochures/\">here</a>."

  body: In InDesign CS2, clicking "More Options" in the Document Setup screen will
    show you a specific option for Bleed size. This is useful because if you export
    a PDF and check "Crop Marks" and other printer's marks, ID will automatically
    add proper marks for that document size and leave the bleeded color/images.

  body: You can setup a bleed area in Illustrator as well. I have a default PDF export
    setting which works in Indy and Illy which I use to include crop, trim and bleed
    marks. I'd also suggest once you create your PDF to test print the separations
    to a laser printer to make sure your colors separate correctly and that extra
    plates don't output.

  body: "Just to note that 'page size' in the context you use it doesn't matter; the
    printers will arrange many copies of your artwork on whatever size sheet their
    press uses (\"imposition\") and then cut down to the finished size using the cropmarks.\r\n\r\nFor
    a regular, rectangular piece, make the page size the same as your finished item."

  body: "This is my process:\r\n\r\nI've found that different print shops do different
    things. Some will print 2-up, some 4-up and some more depending on the situation.
    If I don't know the exact setup, I almost always set my Illustrator artboard to
    11\" x 8 1/2\" and let the printer set up the artwork for the press (assuming
    the printer is well established and knows its stuff).\r\n\r\nThen I create a rectangle
    3 1/2\" x 2\" (for a standard card) with no fill and a 0.25pt stroke in black.
    I'll be deleting this outline before I send it to the printer, but for now I use
    it as a guide of the card edges.\r\n\r\nThen I copy this rectangle and expand
    its dimensions by 1/4\" (or 1/8\" on each side). I remove the stroke on this rectangle
    and give it a light grey fill. I'll be deleting this rectangle as well, but for
    now I use it as a guide of the bleed. Keep in mind, if you aren't printing a bleed,
    you can skip this step.\r\n\r\nTo create the trim marks, I select the original
    3 1/2\" x 2\" rectangle and go Filter > Create > Crop Marks. This will produce
    you trim marks in a registration colour (so that it will print on all plates).
    I usually add registration marks (targets) as well, but most printers can add
    this for you.\r\n\r\nNow, using the guides described above, I layout the front
    of my card. Then, I repeat the steps for the back of the card and set the 2 side-bide
    side (with some breathing room) on my 11\" x 8 1/2\" artboard.\r\n\r\nAs a final
    step, I remove the 2 guide rectangles so that all I'm left with is my artwork
    and the trim marks. Also, I always use the Document Info window in Illustrator
    to do a final check on the artwork before producing a PDF and test print.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps.\r\n\r\n"
