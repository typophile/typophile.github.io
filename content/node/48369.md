  birthday. I had nothing to do with it. I don't think I've ever shown her how to
  draw letters on an arc. She didn't do it in pencil first. When she showed it to
  me it was done, and I was pretty amazed...I mean, how did she know where to put
  the B?  I couldn't do that when I was 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/happybday_5_3494.jpg]"

  body: "Kid's art is awesome, the younger the better.\r\nBut usually on crappy materials
    that are far from the archival quality the work merits.\r\nSo my advice to all
    parents of infants: invest in the proper materials.\r\nIt may seem like an extravagance
    now, and I know things are always tight financially when raising a young family,
    but you won't regret the expense twenty or fifty years from now.\r\nAnd put it
    in a safe place.\r\nMy mother had me enter a children's art competition in 1958,
    and when she died the work was passed on to me.\r\nIt's a bit fragile, but I'm
    touched that she kept it, and it's really amazing to look back on my early work,
    that I don't even remember doing."
