  body: The original name of this font is Helenic Wide. It was an old metal foundry
    face. I don&#39;t know of any digitizations under that name. Looks like it was
    the source for Hefty.

  body: Varityper did a version of Hellenic Wide, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s
    available any more. We had it at an old print shop I worked at that had migrated
    from a Varityper composer to the Mac.
