  an ad for Hollywood Entertainment Museum. Thanks!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/56251.jpg"

    target="_blank">Quaestor</a> is pretty close, regarding the sharp serifs and all...
    but those rounded serifs look like they may be a modification... it&#39;s probably
    just something i don&#39;t recognize though.

  body: Mercury is only available by special arrangement from the Hoefler Type Foundry.
    The best place to see it is in Esquire magazine. They use it as their text face.

    Does it mean that it&#39;s not available to the public? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll check
    out Esquire magazine. <BR> <BR>Thanks all!'

  body: Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think this is Mercury, but it does have similar
    wedge-shaped serifs. <BR> <BR>See <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/mercury.gif"
    target="_blank">here</a> for a sample of Mercury. It was originally designed as
    a newspaper font and is used IIRC by a few newspapers &#40;among them the New
    Times chain&#41; as well as Esquire. According to the staff at H&amp;FJ, it&#39;s
    not quite retail yet, but they told me you can buy it though &#34;special arrangement.&#34;
    Everytime, I&#39;ve tried to obtain it though, my calls are never returned from
    the lady who does their licensing. You may have better luck. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

    the &#34;S&#34; is so unique. I scan for the &#34;S&#34; when I&#39;m searching.
    <BR> <BR>The search continues...

    target="_blank">Hollander</a>, Tiffany? That came to my mind too. Another Unger
