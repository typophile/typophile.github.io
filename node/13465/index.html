<p>I am pretty sure that Whyboq did not design this logo and are passing it off as their own.</p>
<p>Additionally they have appropriated the &ldquo;Sauce&rdquo; identity (scroll down on their site). It was stolen directly from my site
(<a href="http://www.miaandjem.com/work.php?subcatid=2">http://www.miaandjem.com/work.php?subcatid=2</a>)  and the company name changed from Marmalade to Sauce. Unbelivable how desperate some people can be, pathetic!</p>
<p>I would love to let the REAL designer of GO know.</p>

<p>Thanks Ragnar, really nice work on your site too.
I definitely intend to ask them to remove our work from their site. I guess this is one of the down sides to an on-line portfolio.</p>
<p>I wonder how much of the work shown is actually theirs, there are too many different visual styles for my liking.</p>
<p>(and yes we did not stick the Marmalade logo on chopsticks or Conran napkin rings, god forbid!!!!)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had some of my students cheat in this manner, but no so blatantly. Plagiarism is not always immediately apparent. If I didn&rsquo;t notice it at first, I&rsquo;m hesitant to bring it up, because I feel stupid for not having called them on it immediately. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to make them redo an entire project because I had failed to point out a mistake earlier, that would be my fault, wouldn&rsquo;t it? Because I had failed to draw the distinction between homage and plagiarism. So, if I notice plagiarism, I check with other staff, and give the student the benefit of the doubt that they didn&rsquo;t know what they did was wrong, explain why it was, don&rsquo;t make them redo the project, and apologize for having to give them a lower mark for the work.</p>
<p>Usually, plagiarization is not so blatant as the 3 grey blobs. 
But just suppose it was a slightly different color, slightly different arrangement of 3 blobs&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p>But hey, this is a typography forum.
Plagiarism is no big deal in type design &ndash; large software companies have appropriated others' type designs with impunity. Looks like it&rsquo;s infectious.</p>
<hr>
<p>File sharing:</p>
<p>With the present consensus on the acceptability of file &ldquo;sharing&rdquo;, this kind of plagiaristic design behavior may well now only be considered wrong for not giving accreditation: recycling a design, even copying files, is the way of the future. You know what they say &ndash; embrace the technology, the law is out of date&hellip;</p>

<p>Send a formally written email. Then persist - let him know you&rsquo;re fully prepared to seek legal advice to take the matter further.</p>
<p>Once he&rsquo;s aware you&rsquo;re on his case, I&rsquo;m sure your work will <em>mysteriously</em> disappear from his site. I find it frustrating even if &amp; when (I really hope it&rsquo;s &lsquo;when&rsquo; and not &lsquo;if&rsquo;) the work is removed, to know that he might well have used yours and others' work to attract clients.</p>
<p>I really like your work, by the way!</p>

<p>True, but the ethos of remix/filesharing culture is &ldquo;Whatever you can get away with is OK&rdquo;, which makes that subtle distinction irrelevant.</p>
