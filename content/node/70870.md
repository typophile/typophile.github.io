  body: "I think when you see that little \xAE next to the logo the odds are that
    is custom (besides the fact that you can't use the same name). It is very similar
    to some of the work of Angel Koziupa and Ale Paul of Sudtipos, but I didn't see
    an exact match.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    the name,(that old copyright thing), and I'm not planning on using the name just
    the lettering for a completely different project.\r\nAny idea on a font that might
    be similar? "

  body: "Laura, I can suggest a few that to me have sort of this feel, but you may
    need to backslant them to get them more vertical, if that's what you're looking
    for: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bluevinyl/parsley-script/\">Parsley
    Script</a>, by Jess Latham; <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/coffee-script/\">Coffee
    Script</a>, Canada Type's revival of Middleton's \"Wave\" script; and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/alphabetsoup/metroscript/\">Metroscript</a>
    by Michael Doret.\r\n\r\nIt turned out the Sudtipos styles weren't as close as
    I thought at first.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    With the software I use changing the slant is just a mouse click or two, I'll
    see what looks best and go from there.\r\nI'm sure the folks in the boat club
    with Thank you too."
