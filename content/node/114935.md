  body: Sorry donshottype. I did not know about the new type ID board before i posted
    in here. Anyway thanks for letting me know. Anyway the other ID request has not
    yet been successful identifying the font name I was looking for. Please let me
    know the font in the post if possible. Once again Kudos for all of you.
