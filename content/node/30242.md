  and looked through the foundries and places I suspected, including the casual script
  section of the Bowfin site, but no luck. It is a subtitle font used by Food and
  Wine Magazine fairly extensively throughout their issues. I don't believe it was
  used by them until the last year or two.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help. It is my first
  post, couldn't seem to be able to get the image to show up inline as anyting except
  a question mark, sorry if I mess anything up.\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n"

    of any other digital version except for Mousse script by Alejandro Paul. His interpritation
    is to be found at Veer, http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000162#specimen"

    the correct W. I was wrong, or it is an alternate because it is there. Happy Holidays!\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n"

  body: As I said Alejandro's version is not 100% identical with the original Glenmoy.
    But still close enough. Judging from the showings at Veer. It seems that the uppercases
    do carry alternates. I see two "W" The rounded one is very close to the one from
    the magazine, except for angle on the side stroke to the left.

  body: Pretty font! WIsh it was cheaper tho. My personal rule of thumb is I don't
    spend more than about $20/weight for a new font unless I have a specific job in
    mind. Otherwise I'd go broke.

  body: As it happens, I am working on a revival of Stephenson Blake's Glenmoy at
    this very moment. If you can wait a month or so, a digital version, much more
    faithful to the original, will be available at myfonts.com. And it will be my
    usual price...$20.00.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/glenmoy_4213.gif]
