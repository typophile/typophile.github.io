  body: The y in the sample doesn't have a rounded tail like the y in Bembo Schoolbook
    or Bembo Infant.

  body: The "a" and "g" in the sample look a little wonky, like like they are not
    from an official variation of Bembo, not created by an experienced type designer.
    Where is the sample from?

  body: Mark - Sorry, I don't know the original source. Your notion of an amateur
    revision makes sense. I see where the person who changed the "a" and "g" from
    double to single story also for some reason changed the Bembo dollar sign from
    a double to a single vertical line. Thanks all.
