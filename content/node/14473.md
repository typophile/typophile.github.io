  because I saw one of their vans on the way to work this morning. There was more
  text in a style that seemed to be the same, unfortunately I didn't have a camera
  with me.\r\n\r\nIt is simalr to (but not the same as) Process Type's Klavika\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nRichard"

    Identikal's Typeviewer does not seem to want to play with Alwyn for me.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    the van wasn't parked having its breakfast this morning to compare other glyphs.\r\n\r\nRichard"

  body: "This is not really relevant anymore as the company seems to be changing its
    brand at the moment, but purely out of curiosity\u2026 \r\n\r\nI saw the van again
    yesterday, and was able to <a href=\"http://www.rhards.co.uk/pics/eurica van.jpg\"
    target=\"new\">photograph</a> it (complete with me and my \"I like type.\" tee).\r\n\r\nWith
    a few more characters to work with, it looks less like Alwyn.\r\n\r\nOT: is it
    just me, or is this site behaving <strong>very</strong> strangely ATM? Uppercase
    fora seem to have disapeared completely, \"Access Denied\" to various threads
    and the Wiki, etc."
