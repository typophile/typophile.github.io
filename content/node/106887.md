  enough to warrant cross-posting. Comment in the forum of your choice.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew
  Carter's new Sitka* typeface family ships as 24 fonts with Windows 8.1. The standard
  Windows 4-style family is implemented in six different size-specific designs (Small,
  Text, Subhead, Heading, Display, Banner). After Ross and I got involved in the project,
  we spent a lot of time at Microsoft discussing options for software selection of
  size-specific designs. I think we probably hit all the possibilities in one way
  or another -- everything from new GSUB features to Composite Font Representation
  wrapper --, and some of the funkier options were quite attractive. In the end, Microsoft
  opted for a very simple mechanism: two new data values in the OS/2 table, one indicating
  the lower size range limit for the individual font and one the upper size range
  limit. The relationship of the fonts is established via existing name table entries.\r\n\r\nA
  formal spec for the new OS/2 table version should be forthcoming from Microsoft
  in the next few weeks, and will be submitted for inclusion in the ISO MPEG Open
  Font Format. Here are the basics:\r\n\r\nThe OS/2 table is updated to version 5.\r\n\r\nThe
  two new data fields are\r\nusLowerPointSize\r\nusUpperPointSize\r\n\r\nThe unit
  used in defining these values is a twip, i.e. a twentieth of a point. This enables
  size use ranges to break at fractional point sizes without getting unreasonably
  fiddly.\r\n\r\nThe usLowerPointSize value is inclusive; the usUpperPointSize value
  is exclusive. In other words, the lower value indicates the size at which the font
  starts to be used, and the upper value indicates the size at which it is no longer
  used.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE: The Sitka Text font is intended to be used from 9.7 point
  up to any size below 13.5 point. Therefore, the usLowerPointSize value is set to
  194 twips (9.7\xD720) and the usUpperPointSize value is set to 270 twips (13.5\xD720).\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1.
  The size selection mechanism is based on the computer point (1/72 inch). This means
  that selection is made relative to nominal point size, and is not device dependent.
  This may be controversial (hello, David), and while I think it is reasonable in
  the long-term -- given device resolution increases, pinch-zoom behaviour, etc. --
  there are current situations in which one might well want device dependent size
  selection that calls for different outlines for the same nominal point size at different
  resolutions. Folks who want to join in making a case for such should engage with
  the ISO MPEG specification process once MS submit the draft spec.\r\n\r\n2. It should
  go without saying that this new mechanism is intended to replace the existing GPOS
  {size} feature mechanism, which has mostly languished unimplemented since it was
  first specified about 15 years ago. Hacking the GPOS data structure to put font
  selection information in a table normally accessed only at the end of glyph processing
  was always counter-intuitive, and I'm not surprised it turned out to be pretty much
  dead-on-arrival.\r\n\r\n3. In order to implement the new data in the Sitka fonts,
  we wanted to be able to integrate the new OS/2 table version support in our existing
  workflow. Thanks to Frank Blokland at DTL and the OTMaster developers at URW for
  quickly adding this functionality for us, which I believe will be available in the
  next version of OTMaster, which Frank anounced at ATypI.\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\n* At
  ATypI Amsterdam, Matthew gave a presentation with Kevin Larson on the Sitka design
  process, which used iterative legibility testing to refine letter shapes. "

  body: "InDesign's preference for Optical Sizes is, I believe, a legacy Multiple
    Master function, i.e. it doesn't work with OpenType. Adobe is one of the few font
    foundries that actually include GPOS {size} feature data in their OT 'Optical'
    fonts -- terrible term, by the way --, but have not implemented support for it
    in any apps, to my knowledge.\r\n\r\n<em>Is changing the optical size an application
    operation? Can you manually override to another size? And if so, does the text
    need recomposing?</em>\r\n\r\nGood questions all. I'm not sure anyone has fully
    worked out how this should work at the level of interaction between automated
    selection and user discretion. Given Microsoft's tendency to specify data formats
    but not implementation, I expect it will be up to the wider type and design community
    to think about this and determine what we'd expect from different kinds of applications
    (as was the case with, e.g. determining whether Stylistic Set features should
    be treated as additive or exclusive)."

    body: "I could hardly believe that the Indy pref for optical size works only with
      old MMs and not with (as John points out) the ill-denominated 'opticals' (which
      always sounds to me like a nominally health-giving breakfast dish composed of
      stale rusk, eggy stuff, and brewer's yeast, preferably served on a recycled
      floptical). But he is completely correct that the feature has no effect on the
      'opticals'. You must wonder what Adobe's point in publishing the fonts is, if
      no software, not even their own, supports the hapless fonts. \r\n\r\nFor the
      record, Microsoft was the first software publisher to support correct optical
      size automatically. There was a Windows-only version of MSW in the mid-1990s
      that automatically selected the right optical instance of an MM font that contained
      an optical instance. \r\n\r\nSo it is great that MS software will be supporting
      the sizes. Since Sitka is the best thing to happen to type since Sumner Stone's
      Cycles family, I believe, thanks to MS support, that it will eventually be compulsory
      for other software publishers to support the font family fully, whether they
      like it or not. It is so heartening to see a font project like this - - for
      once, everything has been done right. It is just extraordinary to think that
      there will in future years be a lot of really good typesetting being produced
      automatically by people who don't know and don't care that they are doing it.
      That's the way to do it! "

  body: "Ideally, the foundry would set the default values for optical size ranges,
    but the layout application would have a slider so that typographers could adjust
    the ranges*. The foundry would certainly consider target device or demographics
    in deciding where to put the boundaries.\r\n\r\nTypographer manual over-ride is
    necessary because size (degree of arc) is not the only thing that effects readability,
    because apart from device and demographics, there are also color (of text/background)
    and brightness of the document design to be considered.\r\n\r\nIn some cases,
    the adjustment may be better as grading/weight change, rather than size-specific.\r\n\r\n*Quark
    has something like that for editing tracking tables.\r\n\r\n"
