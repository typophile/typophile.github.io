  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all.

I would like to post a question.
What is the best way to "move" vector drawings (sometimes with images), from freehand to Indesign?

I've tried the following:

1. Basic "copy paste"
2. Export as eps and import into Indesign
3. Build a pdf, and open in InDesign
4. Use Illustrator as a "buffer" between the two apllications using "copy paste" method.

Didn't get any conclusions and i still have problems mainly in files with images.
How can i preserve all atributtes such as color, stroke width, fonts, image size and position, etc.

Thanks in advance
Regards</div>

Freehand has serious issues doing anything Adobe related, your on the right lines using illustrator as bridge between the two though. Have you tried exporting your freehand file as an illustrator 7.x file, and then opening that in illustrator? You should be able to find something inDesign friendly that way.

Good luck, and much respect for holding up the freehand quarter!

Yes you can, at least from FH11 to Illustrator CS3. The oposite it's way much different, triyng to paste something into freehand from any adobe apllications it's aparently impossible! Right now i'm having trouble even in pasting things from FH to photoshop. Freehand can be a pain sometimes.

<cite>Have you tried exporting your freehand file as an illustrator 7.x file, and then opening that in illustrator?</cite>

I didn't try that one, perhaps it will help. 

Thanks for your reply</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I constantly move between applications (in various release versions), but just for vector images (not including bitmaps).
Probably the most reliable way is:

Freehand to InDesign:
Copy using "copy special", with the option "EPS" format ticked.
Paste in an Illustrator document / Copy
Paste into an InDesign document.

InDesign to Freehand:
Create a PDF file.
Open the PDF file in Illustrator / Copy
Paste into Freehand.

Please note these important things: the copy/paste settings of the applications should be correctly set (in Illustrator you should choose to preserve paths, I don't recall the option precisely…)
Note also copyng and pasting text blocks results in an inconsistent behavior. In general, text objects can't be properly copy-pasted from an application to the other.

Also, using the "EPS" format with "copy special" allows to copy vector data from Freehand into FontLab without problems.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I add that fiddling with InDesign preferences allows a few different copy behaviors as well.
Although you can't copy into FreeHand direclty, I have discovered you can actually copy from InDesign to Illustrator, and it seems it goes for text objects as well… (I tried in InDesign CS2, but I suppose it's the same for other versions).</div>
