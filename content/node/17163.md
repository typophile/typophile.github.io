body: "In January of 2006, Extensis released it's latest font management product,
  Suitcase Fusion. Suitcase Fusion combines some of the best features of the Suitcase
  and Font Reserve products. A 30 day trial version can be downloaded at:\r\nhttp://www.extensis.com\r\n\r\nSuitcase
  is a font management program for Mac OS and Microsoft Windows. Many users of graphic
  design tools have so many fonts that they cannot keep them active at once in the
  system. A large number of active fonts may degrade application performance as well
  as make it difficult to find fonts.\r\n\r\nSuitcase Fusion, released in January
  of 2006, merges two separate Macintosh font managers previously sold by Extensis.
  One of the font managers, Font Reserve, was previously sold by Diamondsoft before
  it was aquired by Extensis. Suitcase Fusion combines the most popular features of
  both products. For example, Suitcase Fusion retains the straightforward, easy-to-use
  interface of Suitcase X1. It adds to this a key Font Reserve feature, the Vault.
  The Vault is a centralized repository for fonts and font metadata. Both Suitcase
  and Font Reserves can upgrade their databases for Suitcase Fusion.\r\n\r\nSuitcase
  Fusion's vault file located in /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Extensis/Suitcase/.\r\n\r\nAnother
  feature taken from Font Reserve is face level activation for Macintosh font suitcases.
  With most font managers, fonts are activated as a suitcase, which means that all
  of the variations packaged in a suitcase, turn on at once. This would commonly be
  the book, italic, bold and bold italic weights, but some families have many more
  variations. Face level activation makes font conflicts far less likely because only
  the needed parts of a suitcase can be activated.\r\n\r\nSuitcase Fusion also features
  auto-activation plug-ins for popular design applications. Documents opened will
  automatically activate the fonts they need. If a user has more than one font with
  the same Postscript name, Suitcase uses an Extensis-developed technology called
  FontSense to determine which font was used in the document.\r\n\r\nSuitcase works
  with all fonts that are compatible with a given operating system. On Macintosh systems,
  this includes PostScript Type 1, TrueType, and OpenType.\r\n\r\nSuitcae Fusion is
  compatible with Mac OS 10.3.9 and later.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/suitcasefusion.jpg]"
