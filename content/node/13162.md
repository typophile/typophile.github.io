body: My client uses FF Din for everything, and now I should design a brochure in
  Russian... I haven't been able to find a Cyrillic version of the font, does anybody
  know if there is one (Mac)? Alternatively, can you suggest a replacement?

  body: Paratype sells a Cyrillic "<a href="http://www.paratype.com/pstore/default.asp?search=DIN+Condensed&fcode=PT_DNC">DIN
    Condensed</a>". But if you need more weights, their <a href="http://www.paratype.com/pstore/default.asp?search=ITC+Officina+Sans&fcode=PT_OSN">ITC
    Officina Sans</a> might be a good replacement.
