  know what condensed is, but what does Compact mean?\r\nWhat's the difference?\r\n\r\nThx."

  body: "Actually, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.10001.0.0\">FF
    Dax Condensed</a> is about the same width as <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11416.0.0\">FF
    Dax Compact</a>. The main difference is the latter has...\r\n\r\n\"relatively
    small ascenders and descenders and the uppercase letters have the same height
    as the lowercase ascenders. This makes the typeface optically larger -- useful
    for headlines and posters where words must shout.\" - Hans Reichel"

  body: "Typically the terms compact and compressed refer to a width narrower than
    condensed.  This width is almost always used only for large display sizes. Condensed
    can be used (in small doses) for text. \r\nFrom what Stephen says, I infer that
    FF is using the compact description to indicate that it is a headline font.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
