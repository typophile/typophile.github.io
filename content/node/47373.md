body: "I need a recommendation for a font that's the kind you'd see in national (or
  state or whatever) park signage.\r\nI'm designing the opening and end credits for
  a friend's film. The film's name is 'Turistas' ('Tourists'), and revolves around
  some people traveling to and through a state park.\r\nWe've decided to try to evoke
  tourist-oriented signage and guide books. I've identified a dingbat font ('NPS Pictographs')
  of the sort of symbols you see in guidebooks (little icons of waterfalls, horses,
  skiers, etc.), which we'll definitely use, probably for the end credit roll. \r\nI'm
  missing a good text font to complement the touristy look. \r\nThanks!\r\n"
