  body: 'This isn&#39;t as interesting as the serif one, but I think it does have
    a novel variety in the forms &#40;like in the &#34;bdpq&#34; bowls, the &#34;s&#34;,
    etc.&#41; which makes it worthwhile. Not to mention that nice gentle stroke modulation
    - which you might actually apply more, like in the top of the &#34;a&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>Super-thin weights are very hard to make even, and you can see problems, like
    when you compare the &#34;W&#34; and the &#34;X&#34;. <BR> <BR>Your descenders
    are long, but in a design like this it might be OK. <BR> <BR>I think the head
    of the &#34;g&#34; is slightly large. The Tilde is too dark. The &#34;y&#34; is
    great. <BR> <BR>The only glyphs I have serious problems with are the &#34;G&#34;,
    the &#34;Q&#34; and the &#34;R&#34;. But I only have an idea for the last one:
    try making it open &#40;no middle join to the stem&#41;. And I might just leave
    the &#34;Q&#34; like that, since it&#39;s such a flamboyant letter anyway. The
    &#34;G&#34; just needs tweaking. BTW, the &#34;Z&#34; looks like it&#39;s leaning
    to the right. <BR> <BR>I like the numerals, especially: that they&#39;re short;
    how sexy that &#34;2&#34; is. The &#34;4&#34; &#40;especially&#41; and the &#34;6&#34;
    and &#34;9&#34; are a bit wide. The &#34;8&#34; is great. <BR> <BR>Other stuff:
    <BR>- That ampersand is great. So is the Pound Sign. And the Section. <BR>- I
    think I&#39;d make the bars of the Yen longer. <BR>- The Pilcrow is superb. <BR>-
    The Asterisk is too dark - although you might still leave it a bit darker than
    the rest, since it&#39;s supposed to get attention. <BR>- At Sign: I&#39;d use
    a monocular &#34;a&#34;. Better for legibility. <BR>- ae: I&#39;d unify the mid
    stroke. <BR>- OE: the &#34;O&#34; is too weak. <BR>- fi/fl: very nice. <BR>- Eszet:
    very nice. Maybe no descender. <BR>- ch: the &#34;c&#34; is a bit strong. <BR>-
    Agute/Grave accents: I&#39;d place them a little bit more centrally. <BR>- Some
    of the other stuff is too dark. <BR> <BR>Trapping: everybody knows I love the
    stuff, but in such a light design &#40;which will almost always be used pretty
    large&#41; those traps are too big. But in  the heavier weights you want even
    more! <BR> <BR>Spacing: I think your overall tightness is very good. <BR> <BR>hhp
    <BR>'
