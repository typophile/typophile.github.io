  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Dear Typophiles,</p>
<p>I was asked to redesign a website for a printing company. After some research I have to say that most of printers' websites don&rsquo;t look very inviting, to put it mildly.</p>
<p>I guess Typophile, full of people publishing for print, is the right place to ask my questions. Your feedback would be much appreciated.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the first thing you are looking for when visiting a printer's website?</li>
<li>Do you think that the quality of a printers' website may be an indication of their services quality? If a site is too complicated - do you leave it and forget it or are you trying e-mail or call them?</li>
<li>Do you prefer to get a quote on-line or do it over a phone?</li>
<li>What else would you expect from a good printers' website?</li>
</ol>
If you have anything else to add, please don't hesitate to do so.
<p>Thanks.</p>

<li>Quality of a web site can only reflect well upon the company. That said, I&rsquo;ve had plenty of good experiences with companies that have ugly web sites. If a site is too complicated, surely I&rsquo;ll leave.</li>

<p>Yes, I think it will really reflect on the printer as do all websites. Keep it really simple no flash crap! People will only spend about 30 seconds on a page maybe less and if they can&rsquo;t get what they&rsquo;re looking for they&rsquo;ll just go back to google!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dont mind really, I don&rsquo;t like to fill in online forms I prefer an email address with a fast responce. (maybe a standard price list, but not loads of reading)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some examples of work shot professionally, work done by previous designers&hellip; a small bit dont go crazy!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important thing is to keep it simple don&rsquo;t over design it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>NO ON-LINE QUOTES!
I never get quotes on line or on the phone. I e-mail specifications to printers and I ask them to send me quotes back by e-mail.</p>
<p>I find that no printer&rsquo;s web site quote apparatus is sufficient for me to convey all the info I need to give them. I have a boilerplate spec form that I customize to each project. I rarely get calls or e-mails asking me to clarify specifications. When I try to convey specifications via inadequate on-line forms I always get calls about what I meant. Usually the calls are stupid calls that could have been answered by the caller if she/she had taken 2 more minutes.</p>
<p>Other than that, I want to know what kinds of books they produce, and especially what their binding capabilities are. I like to be able to see what kinds of text stock they keep on the floor.</p>
<p>&amp; I don&rsquo;t care about the ability to upload files to a website or ftp site. I always send printers a stack of page proofs anyway, so I might as well burn the files to a CD and send it along. Not that much time difference.</p>
<p>I realize that the quality of a web site has little to do with the quality of a finished book. But still, if I have to look at these things, I do hope they will be easy to navigate, at the very least. I do not want to see any stock photos of one person peeping over the shoulder of someone else sitting at a monitor.</p>

<p>What is the first thing you are looking for when visiting a printer’s website?
-Technical capabilities, prices and turnaround time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think that the quality of a printers’ website may be an indication of their services quality? If a site is too complicated - do you leave it and forget it or are you trying e-mail or call them?
-I would expect a competent and professional printer to likewise respect the quality of designer&rsquo;s work and invest in a conceptually sound and aesthetically pleasing website. At the same time, I would rather go for a relatively simple and crudely made site, then a confusing multi-tabbed juggernaut of marketing nonsense. I expect my relationship with the printer to be direct and personal, and the latter type of a site, would suggest the nightmarish future of being bounced between faceless departments, with all of the confusion, mistakes and misunderstandings that can arise from that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you prefer to get a quote on-line or do it over a phone?
-Online (via email) if possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What else would you expect from a good printers’ website?
-Easy transfer of large files, examples of prior work, easily accessible templates for commonly used cd&rsquo;s and folders, list of preferred formats and file specs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m with Will, but I don&rsquo;t mind getting quotes over the phone. Perhaps I just don&rsquo;t trust myself or the printer enough. But I find that a conversation must take place in between myself and the printer. Discussing the project is where a lot of the bugs get worked out. If I only get a quote from a list of specifications and I don&rsquo;t get any remarks I worry that they are only scanning over what I&rsquo;ve requested and are not really focussed on what I need.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Let me expand on what I earlier wrote.</p>
<p>I only specify and buy printing for books, casebound and paperbound. I work with only six printers at the most over the course of a year. Sales and service staff at these printers and I know one another quite well. Specifications for books such as we publish are for the most part pretty standard. It is in the details where each differs from the others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I type out my specs and require in return quotes that can be shown on paper: I want that paper trail.</p>
<p>Plus: I am a bit constrained in my bidding process by state purchasing regulations. The paperless office is not yet here: the Finance office requires a paper copy and I keep one on hand for reference. Storage of quotes will always be an issue: paper in file cabinets or files on a server which is already overcrowded.</p>
