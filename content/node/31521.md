  of early and mid twentieth century American paintings and drawings. The donor of
  the collection was described as forward-thinking for his time, but also elegantly
  classical in his bearing. I got approval on the cover painting and a typographic
  direction. At the moment I'm using for the title Alternate Gothic 3 and Adobe Jenson
  Pro for the body copy font (and the italic for the sub-head). I want to use a Pro
  font because there will be a thicket of fractions, etc. in the lengthy Catalog Raison\xE9e
  for this book.\r\n\r\nMy two questions to you esteemed type hounds are: \r\n\r\n1.
  Do Alternate Gothic 3 and Adobe Jenson Pro look too strange together? See cover
  sketch attached.\r\n\r\n2. I'd like to use a sans serif family as a secondary font
  set for captions/pull quotes/folios/whatever. Considering Trade Gothic and News
  Gothic. Any other font ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    I'm not getting the Jenson in this context. I'd be very tempted to try and make
    the whole project work with Whitman.\r\n\r\nLet's see what others say."

    York, 1940, is a big upscale art book--all figurative stuff, of course, pre-Pollock.\r\n\r\nThe
    title is set in Weiss Initials, and the text in 14 pt Centaur. Weiss Italic is
    used for captions, and Weiss Roman for the catalog.\r\n\r\nAs the Centaur is letterpress,
    with a lot of gain, it's quite like Adobe Jenson.\r\n\r\nThey avoided anything
    with commercial or European Modernist associations, which narrowed the field considerably!\r\n\r\n"

    that I need to use an Open Type font with a fairly large family. I'm loving the
    look of Whitman with DynaGrot, but Font Bureau tells me that the only fractions
    they have are for Whitman Display Condensed Bold, which is not useful for the
    extensive text I need it for. \r\n\r\nCentaur is a beauty but again, the whole
    Open Type requirement..."

  body: "Looks like a fun project. You really don't need open type if you choose a
    font family that has an expert collection.\r\n\r\nI recently ran into the same
    set of issues - looking for a sans family to use for caps etc. in an art book.
    Unfortunately most early to mid-century sans don't have the open type features
    - or the full expert set. I ended up creating style sheets for my fractions. I
    used Electra and Geometric 415 - both by Dwiggins from the 30s. But there are
    a lot of beautiful serif fonts that have all the requisite bells and whistles
    such as Dante.\r\n\r\nI don't find DynaGrot appropriate for the period, and find
    Centaur way too antique looking (altho it does have an expert set). Whitman is
    lovely."

  body: "Not to highjack the thread, but would you mind (Patty) elaborating on the
    period and DynaGrot? Is it because its sources pre-date the paintings' period?
    I sometimes waffle between periods when a type was created and then when it came
    into fashion/use.\r\n\r\nCaledonia might be something to look at for this project."

    it at any of the font suppliers I know. Is it of the era? I was going on looks
    and it looked contemporary to me but of course I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nI can't
    say I really like it but that could also be the large sample, it might look very
    nice at text sizes. \r\n\r\nCan you post a link to it?"

    Storm's page\u2014\r\n\r\n\"In all italics of the DynaGrotesk family, however,
    the design of lower-case letters markedly differs from that of upright lower-case
    letters. The warm character of DynaGrotesk derives from early sans-serif type
    faces, those which appeared before Helvetica. The complete installation of all
    designs of DynaGrotesk is the professional choice of the designer of the most
    demanding magazine.\"\r\n\r\nIt does appear less colorful in small sizes, but
    the pre-Helvetica-institution quirkiness always shines through. There are so many
    weights and widths I was sure to fail at presenting an example but it seemed to
    have some resonance with the geometry of Caledonia/Joanna/Whitman. The ear on
    the \"g\" and several other details are not a good match though IMO."

  body: "Thanks for the comments, including hijacks et al.\r\n\r\nDynaGrot has some
    endearing quirks, but doesn't have the right feel. Pre-Helvetica is exactly right.
    I keep coming back to Trade Gothic, but have to test it in layout with the serif
    body copy font.\r\n\r\nFor body copy, I adore Centaur but agree that it is too
    old world for this project. Joanna's italic has always had a pinched feel to me.
    Caledonia would work really well. But at the moment, I'm exploring a surprising
    possibility: Chapparel. Mark Jamra suggested it and at first I dismissed this,
    but then discovered that there was a resemblance to a font on a brochure from
    1913 (it looks like a Cheltenham Bold). I usually prefer historic fidelity, but
    am struck by how workable and appealing Chapparel has been so far. It is handsome
    in widely letterspaced all caps for pull quotes and titles, and very legible as
    body copy. "

    I seem to have it in my computer - open type and all - but I'll be damned if I
    know how it got there. I can't even find it in any folders."
