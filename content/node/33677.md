body: "Optima is certainly amongst the most readable (and used) sans serifs, but how
  readable do you guys really think it is? I mean for setting extended text, like
  say a book. Hermann Zapf's \"About alphabets\" was originaly printed with the metal
  type Optima and that was quite readable. But the digital versions aren't quite as
  strong. Except maybe Optima nova, which has a colour closer to the original metal
  type, but has anyone actually tested it out?\r\n"

    what Jeremy said.\r\n\r\nLook at Pascal in comparison:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/15782\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I find it very grey and bland in text. It's got a consistent vertical stress
    and very wide shapes, and the basic weight, while appropriate for letterpress,
    looks too light and wispy in digital form. You could try the Medium weight of
    the new version, but that only solves the basic weight issue. Linotype has printed
    specimens of Optima Nova, which you could get to see the performance in text.
    I've seen the original digital Optima in text but at uncommonly large sizes. There
    are <a href=\"\thttp://www.beorcana.com/\">other alternatives,</a> however.....

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/itc-tiepolo/\">ITC Tiepolo</a>
    is quite nice: you can notice the minimal serif at the bold weight and larger
    sizes, but it is otherwise not very obvious and nicely readable.  \r\n\r\nI've
    got a client  that uses it as their standard text face, for both print and pdf,
    for publications directed at primarily an older audience, but that is attractive
    enough for \"young'uns.\"  :-)"

  body: "Ok, this is our monthly bash Optima thread. Again, I don't agree. The original
    is too grey in text, but is wonderfully elegant when well used in display--especially
    the caps. I don't know how much the Optima Nova fixes the greyness--it is obviously
    intended to--as I don't have it and haven't seen examples. \r\n\r\nThe Pascal
    is very impressive, but I don't see it as an alternative to Optima, they are so
    different. \r\n\r\nTiepolo and Carl's Beorcana seem to be more in the same space,
    but Beorcana is way better, IMHO. \r\n"

- body: "cool, thanks guys! i hadn't actually seen any specimens of Optima nova but
    it does seem to be a still too grey. However I have to say I still quite like
    it as a display type, even tho im not so big on those new ligatures they've added.\r\n\r\nPascal
    really is quite impressive. I think its what I was going for, did you ever find
    out where to buy it from hrant, or are they still working on that?\r\n\r\nAs for
    Tiepolo and Beorcana, Tiepolo seems a bit too quircky for me right now but Beorcana
    is quite nice.\r\n"
