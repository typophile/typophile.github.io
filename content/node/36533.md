  body: "Why does everybody feel the need to <em>shout</em> at us lately? It's <em>\"Please
    help me identify this font!\"</em> all over the place since the Board turned into
    a refugee camp. I mean, really, whatever happened to courtesy? And is it so hard
    to come up with descriptive titles for the threads?\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I'm taking
    this out in your specific thread, Judith -- it's nothing personal and certainly
    not meant that way. :^/"

  body: "Wow.....I said please!  I needed help!  I was just being direct.  Should
    I have skirted the issue?\r\n\r\nI actually thought about that title--and felt
    bad it was so simple.  BUT I honestly couldn't think of another....I was kind
    of stressed out dealing with the new cs3 (why did they have to change everything!)
    and trying to find this font.  I could have been flowery. Maybe I should have
    said \"Hi all-I am desperate for help on this delicate curvacious candy company
    logo...can you save me?\"...but I would have been wasting your time. OH WELL,
    maybe you needed some humor yesterday.  It probably the just eclipse getting the
    most of you.\r\n\r\nI do appreciate the answer though!  It's so great to have
    this place.  I asked several long time deasigner friends and no one could come
    up with the answer!  The closest I came, was one friend who said \"I think it
    may be an old letraset font.\" BUT, I don't have my letraset catalogs anymore.
    Stephen you are my HERO!\r\n\r\nBaldy, Perhaps you should make your concerns a
    topic!  More peope will read it.\r\n\r\nThanks again!  Hope today finds you perkier
    :-)\r\n\r\n"

    Type ID Board -- Frequently Asked Questions ***</a> would make its intentions
    pretty obvious, but maybe I should call the thread <strong><em>!!! READ THIS FIRST
    GOSHDARNIT !!!</em></strong>. ;^) :^P"
