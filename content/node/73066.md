  body: I'm new to design so I apologize if this sounds rookie.. I first came across
    this website last week and I remember there being a more slender font used for
    the header.  I'm looking for a web font closest to the uploaded image.  Something
    that will be acceptable across most browsers as well.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/geo_sans_light_6330.PNG]
