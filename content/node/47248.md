body: "Pan Am used this font in their 1986 \"Billboard\" Livery to display the names
  of individual aircraft. It is a very ornate script font.  I've never been able to
  identify it or find a source for it.  I'm an avid flight simulation fan, and would
  like to incorporate it in my aircraft repaints.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Clipper

  assistance is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nMichael Verlin"
