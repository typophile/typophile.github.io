  Whitman (to pair with Nobel)? I am looking for a serif partner / mate--this is for
  little home accessories design firm that is aiming for a luxe/modern-but-timeless
  aura.\r\n\r\nThx in advance!"

  body: "This kind of question is one of the uses for the <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\">Serif
    Font ID Guide</a>. If you pick the key letters from Whitman that you want to resemble
    the font you may already have, and then search on those letter attributes you
    will see a list of fonts with similar structural characteristics. They certainly
    won't all look even similar, but a few might.\r\n\r\nIf you don't select letter
    characteristics that you don't 'need' you broaden the possibilities you can see.
    For example, if I ignored the 'b', 'E', 'K' and 'W' I got 13 different choices
    from about 6 different serif families (in addition to Whitman).\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "According to Kent's [[http://kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanSpecimen.pdf|Specimen
    PDF on Whitman]] It was Gill's Joanna, not Perpetua, that was the inspiration,
    along with Caledonia. It is a marriage of the two, but a very creative one that
    doesn't look like any other type\u2014that's one reason it's so good. Buy it and
    enjoy :)"

  body: Thanks, William -- I knew Dwiggins and Gill were involved, but didn't dig
    deeply enough. I still see a bit of Perpetua in Whitman, but the sturdiness of
    Joanna is the more obvious antecedent.

  body: "@meanjean\r\n\r\nThere is nothing quite like Whitman. Believe me I know\u2014I
    have looked around for a \"replacement\" typeface for a while now (Whitman's lack
    of CE support was driving me insane\u2026), and I have failed.\r\n\r\nBoth Joanna
    and Scala are great, yet they each possess various idiosyncrasies and exuberances
    that are not present in the calm and meandering Whitman. Whitman is one of those
    rare typefaces that can maintain neutrality without being boring. I can only hope
    that one day it goes \"Pro\".\r\n\r\nIf you do not require the extended language
    support, I second William's advise not to look for replacements and to get the
    real deal."
