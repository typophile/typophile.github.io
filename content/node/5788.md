  <BR> <BR>What do you guys think of Linotype&#39;s latest value pack? Six representative
  &#34;Old English&#34; fonts at such a low package price. I was even more impressed
  after I compared it with an older value pack on Fonts.com &#40;<a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?nCo=AFMT&amp;pid=371688"

  body: "According to Martin Kotulla, SoftMaker is finally having an update on Blackletter
    typefaces, splitting up most Blackletter typefaces to include 2 layouts each:
    \"Regular\" (Original) and \"DFR\" (German Fraktur), but some Blackletter typefaces
    only have the original layout, no German Fraktur.\r\n\r\nThe following Blackletter
    typefaces in the layouts of \"Regular\" (Original) and \"DFR\" (German Fraktur)
    are:\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\"Alte Schwabacher\" - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"C652 Blackletter\"
    (Caslon Gotisch) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"E780 Blackletter\" (Engravers Old English,
    ATF) - 4 styles (including Regular & Bold, each with 2 layouts)\r\n\u2022\t\"Fraktur\"
    (Fette Fraktur) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"Gotisch\" (Fette Gotisch) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"Goudy
    Text\" - 4 styles (including Regular & Lombardic Caps, each with 2 layouts)\r\n\u2022\t\"J790
    Blackletter\" (Unger Fraktur) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"L750 Blackletter\" (London
    Text) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"Marriage\" (Mariage) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"Old
    Blackletter\" (Old English Text, Monotype) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"P790 Blackletter\"
    (Poppl-Fraktur) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"Rundgotisch\" (Weiss Rundgotisch) - 2
    styles\r\n\u2022\t\"W650 Blackletter\" (Walbaum Fraktur) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"W722
    Blackletter\" (Wilhelm-Klingspor Gotisch) - 2 styles\r\n\u2022\t\"Z690 Blackletter\"
    (Zentenar Fraktur) - 4 styles (including Regular & Bold, each with 2 layouts)\r\n\r\nThe
    following \"original layout\"-only Blackletter typefaces are:\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\"American
    Text\"\r\n\u2022\t\"F692 Blackletter\" (Fette Fraktur)\r\n\u2022\t\"G820 Blackletter\"
    (Gregorian)\r\n\u2022\t\"Gothic\" (Weiss Gotisch)\r\n\u2022\t\"Light Text\" (Linotype
    Text/Linotext)\r\n\u2022\t\"Ottoman\" (Old English Text, Monotype)\r\n\u2022\t\"P650
    Blackletter\" (Paladin)\r\n\r\nAnd yet, exclusive Blackletter typeface designs
    include most with two layouts (Regular & Dfr), and some with the layout of \"original\"
    only, no German Fraktur.   These fonts are finally appearing on two of SoftMaker's
    premium-quality typeface collections - \"MegaFont XXL 3.0\" for home users, and
    \"infiniType 4\" for designers - both being released around May 27, 2014."

  body: I&#39;m wondering, is there a difference between Old English and Blackletter?
    Is the former a way of not appearing to be a neo-fascist? Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch
    - puhleeze. <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW, Dan, although I don&#39;t think your enthusiasm
    is contrived, it would be useful to note that you work for Linotype!  :-&#41;

  body: Well, I try to hold myself back from working in &#34;I work for Linotype&#34;
    into every posting. They certainly do not pay me to post things on the net, nor
    to do below-the-line advertising such as this. And I&#39;m not typing this up
    at work either. <BR> <BR>Plus, I will only be a Linotype employee for three more
    days! After that, I be in limbo for a few weeks, while the German government decides
    whether to renew my work permit or not <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> . I&#39;ve already exceeded the amount that I&#39;m &#34;supposed&#34;
    to work in one year. <BR> <BR>--- <BR>That being said, let&#39;s talk about &#34;Old
    English Type.&#34; &#40;one last disclosure,  I did do some writing about the
    old englishness of old english types that will be released in later marketing
    materials from LL. But this is not a marketing ploy&#41;. Until last week, I thought
    that Old English was a total misnomer, something that ignorant font-buyers used
    when searching on the internet. Well, I was wrong! <BR> <BR>Old English referes
    primarially to historized texturas design in England during the victorian era.
    Texturas were introduced into England during the 1400s. And, as everyone here
    probably knows, I LOVE TEXTURAS! The victorians loved them too, but thought them
    out of date and illegibile, it seems. So they &#34;modernized&#34; them. This
    is classicism. Mariage &#40;in the Old English Pack&#41; is a revival of Morris
    Fuller Benton&#39;s Wedding, originally from 1901 and thoroughly Old English.
    <BR> <BR>So almost anything &#34;historicized&#34;  and &#34;textura-inspired&#34;
    can be vaguely Old English, whether it was designed by an Englishman in England
    or not. Blackmoor is from Quay, and supposedly based on something old and english.
    Notre Dame and WK Gotisch are not english at all but are texturas, and WKG is
    very historicized, just in a beautiful germanic manner by Koch instead of Benton&#39;s
    or the Victorian-style. <BR> <BR>Notre Dame is not as historicized, but it is
    an interesting revival of pre-printing texturas. So I think that it is vaguely
    appropriate, too. <BR> <BR>Monotype&#39;s packet has more pure old englishes in
    it, maybe, but it also has a Fraktur, which I can&#39;t see as being Old English
    at all. Way farther off than ND or WKG &#40;oh heavenly diety, please lighten
    the typophile&#39;s hearts so that they don&#39;t think that I am trying to dis
