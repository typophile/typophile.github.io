body: "Good morning typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm just asking myself whether it is possible
  in Fontlab 5 to temporarely use shorter names for some glyphs like \"Asmall\" or
  \"germandbls\" while doing metrics.\r\n\r\nExample: It is fine to kern uppercase
  and lowercase:\r\n\r\nHHOHHADAHHOHH\r\nHHOHHAEAHHOHH\r\nHHOHHAFAHHOHH\r\n...\r\n\r\nnnonnadannonn\r\nnnonnaeannonn\r\nnnonnafannonn\r\n...\r\n\r\nThe
  character of concern can be exchanged very fast.\r\n\r\nBut it is almost painful
  to do so with smallcaps:\r\n\r\n/Hsmall/Hsmall/Osmall/Hsmall/Hsmall/Asmall/Dsmall/Asmall/Hsmall/Hsmall/Osmall/Hsmall/Hsmall\r\n/Hsmall/Hsmall/Osmall/Hsmall/Hsmall/Asmall/Esmall/Asmall/Hsmall/Hsmall/Osmall/Hsmall/Hsmall\r\n/Hsmall/Hsmall/Osmall/Hsmall/Hsmall/Asmall/Fsmall/Asmall/Hsmall/Hsmall/Osmall/Hsmall/Hsmall\r\n\r\n\r\nTo
  do this job, it would be nice to say: for the time of beeing, when I say \"A\" i
  mean \"Asmall\", when I say \"B\" i mean \"Bsmall\", etc.\r\n\r\nIs there a way
  to achieve this, or is there another faster way to to endless spacing and kerning
  of smallcaps? I'm aware of kerning classes etc. it's all just about faster program
  handling...\r\n\r\nThanks for your help\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't know about doing your idea, but you can pre-compose a list of preview
    strings and then save as a plain text file. This can be imported into the Metrics
    window by clicking on the \"...\" button in the lower right corner and then the
    folder button in the upper right of the Load Text window. \r\n\r\nOnce you import
    your list of preview strings, you can cycle through them quickly using the up
    and down arrow keys on your keyboard. You can also select a specific preview string
    from the pop-up menu to the left of the \"...\" button in the lower right corner
    of the Metrics window.\r\n\r\nIt can take a while to pre-compose your list of
    preview strings, but once you do it you can use them as often as you like. It's
    a time saver in the long run."

    may need to break up into smaller files if it gets too big. I'm not sure exactly
    what the limit is, but it seems to be 32k, at least on the Mac version."

    \"Asmall\". Use \"A.smcp\" or \"A.sc\" or \"A.small\" instead. \r\n\r\nA."

    \"A.smcp\"; \"one.op\" etc. was the recommendation. But now all Adobe's fonts
    seem to come small caps named \"Asmall\" etc., and a Unicode index assigned from
    the private use area."

    still uses \"Tsmall\" and \"oneoldstyle.\" But whatever. I do notice that Garamond
    Premier Pro does assign a PUA number to all the small caps & oldstyle figures.
    (And I can't resist -- if 2001 is \"ancient,\" I must be \"decomposed.\")"

  body: "Charles, \r\n\r\nOpenType was introduced in 1999. Today, we have 2006, which
    is seven years later. The Christian civilization is 2000 years old. In these terms,
    OpenType fonts made in 2000 are located in the 280s, which was when the Chinese
    were the first to use the magnetic compass, and emperor Aurelian invaded Gallia
    and was trying to conquest Persia. Fonts made in 2002 correspond the 850s when
    the Vikings invaded London and Constantinople, and Cyril and Methodius were on
    their way to the Kazakh lands. \r\n\r\nIt is somewhat new times, but well, not
    really so new. \r\n\r\nAdobe recently announced that their next OpenType fonts
    will no longer use PUA. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
