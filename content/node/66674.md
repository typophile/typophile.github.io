  title=\"Validator report\">has two validation errors</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>I think
  the off-grey text colour (<code>#333</code>) is too light, especially on the grey
  background. I would just make the text flat black in that case.</li>\r\n\t<li>Hyperlinks
  are too difficult to distinguish from body copy. This isn\u2019t just bad usability;
  it also <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#qr-visual-audio-contrast-without-color\"
  title=\"Use of Colo[u]r\">violates WCAG 2</a>, but a lot of things here do. The
  colour is too pale. You additionally need some kind of underline (<code>border-bottom</code>
  solves the problem of amputating descenders found with <code>text-decoration: underline</code>).</li>\r\n\t<li>You
  need to be much more specific in styling links. Styling plain <code>a</code> catches
  every anchor, including invisible, non-link anchors. You want <code>a:link</code>
  then <code>a:visited</code> then the pair of <code>a:hover,a:active</code> (defined
  together to get around IE6 bugs). Other combinations are possible, of course. (Eric
  Meyer\u2019s <a href=\"http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/06/11/who-ordered-the-link-states/\"
  title=\"Who ordered the link states?\">standard advice</a> is to specify them in
  order of \u201C<code>L</code>o<code>V</code>e\u2019s <code>H</code>urts <code>F</code>ade
  <code>A</code>way,\u201D but some experts disagree.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Unless you have
  a serious design intent in a well-planned layout, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a
  good idea to mess with visitors\u2019 default font size. Hence <code>font-size:
  1em</code> (or <code>100%</code>) is advisable for body copy. You\u2019ve got variously
  .9em and .85em, which explains why the type is too damned small. (And those numbers
  can multiply together, as you know.) I see a computed 11px type size in Safari 4.
  This is pretty small.</li>\r\n\t<li>We don\u2019t have a print CSS, which is rather
  shocking. It\u2019s quite easy to put together, and can be included in the main
  CSS without recourse to a separate file (put it all inside <code>@media print {\_}</code>).</li>\r\n\t<li>We
  don\u2019t have a mobile CSS, or, as it has devolved at present, a CSS for iPhones/iTouches
  and other Mobile WebKit browsers. These are more troublesome to set up (ask <a href=\"http://metatalk.metafilter.com/18420/\"
  title=\"iPhone CSS for MetaFilter\">PB at MetaFilter</a> for help); if you\u2019re
  too specific in your selectors, you\u2019ll leave out mobile devices that could
  actually use the stylesheet; and, significantly, the whole enterprise makes a mockery
  of the <code>handheld</code> media type, which was supposed to solve all our problems
  but obviously won\u2019t.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

    distinct link style</a> and a print style sheet.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I think it\u2019s
    odd that unordered lists within posts are rendered at a smaller font-size than
    the rest."
