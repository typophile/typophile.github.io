  in illustrator. So I figured I would enlist the help of the throbbing brain that
  is typophile.com. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Both \"Dutch's Daughter\"
  and \"Restaurant\"\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/DD-LOGO_5672.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DD-LOGO2_4581.jpg]"
