  body: "The other one is Busorama (ahh, a font I hoped I could forget)\r\n\r\nIt
    seems though that this is the Mecanorma version (see <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?DSO\">here</a>,
    which doesn't seem to be available anywhere. The <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/busorama/fonts/\">available
    versions</a> have the legs of \"K\" and \"R\" curve the other way. Hm."
