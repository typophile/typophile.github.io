body: I&#39;m designing a &#39;Cheers&#39;-type sign in stained glass and am looking
  for some help in changing the original letters of &#39;Cheers&#39; to &#39;Hunters&#39;
  while keeping the feel of the font.  The capital &#39;H&#39; is especially difficult.  The
  original font is &#39;ITC cabaret. <BR>Any advice?

  body: Actually, the Cheers logo is a combination of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/flamenco/inline-d/testdrive.html?s=heers&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Flamenco Inline</a> and possibly <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/candice/candice/testdrive.html?s=C&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Candice</a> with some custom modifications.
