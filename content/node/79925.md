  3 still are unidentified, so I thought I post these seperate. If someone can identify
  one or more of these font's, that would be a great help:\r\n\r\n1. (Look at the
  number \"2\". Can't find a font that has the same number \"2\")\r\n<img src=\"http://i54.tinypic.com/14u9v6f.jpg\">\r\n\r\n2.\r\n<img

  body: Don't think so. The "a" is completely different, and some of the serifs are
