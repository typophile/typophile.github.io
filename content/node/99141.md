    Default stroke alignment is \"outside\", set it to \"inside\" or else it won't
    do anything visible."

    sure, but so is making a font bolder with an added stroke.\r\nWhat else can you
    do when you need a <em>slightly</em> bolder (or, in Charles' case, lighter) font?
    I do this to match the visual weight of, say, Myriad Pro Greek characters, when
    my sans of choice doesn't contain any."

  body: "<cite>Ruin</cite> a typeface? Usually I'm trying to save one.\r\n\r\nSure,
    I can edit the beziers, but some licenses forbid that. When you have to use one
    of those silly fonts, what to do? Fortunately, we're fast approaching the point
    where you can do most of the things in a layout program that you can do in a font
    editor. Even better, looking only at the print edition, who could tell  where
    the work was done?\r\n\r\nBut aside from that, lightening might be useful when,
    say, the font was drawn using a 12-pont master, and you need to set 42-point display.
    Not as good as starting over and drawing up a set of glyphs designed to work at
    that size, but (maybe) better than nothing.\r\n\r\nRemember that post by the person
    who complained that at a large size needed for the title page, Trump looked too
    heavy? A .02 point or so reduction in stroke would help a fair bit, I'd think."

  body: "Trying is wonderful. Succeeding isn't half bad either. Suffice it to say
    that type designers (even the -generally- low-end \"open\" variety) don't derive

    aren't as brutish as stroking. Are they wasting their time?\r\n\r\n* Even super-subtle
    \"grades\", like at FB.\r\n\r\n** http://www.typophile.com/node/81774\r\n\r\nConcerning
    what to do about EULAs: I've always advised ignoring unreasonable clauses at will,
    while remaining prepared to pay for getting caught. Just like I can't advise people
    to take the \"nothing must be hanging from the rear-view mirror\" traffic law
    seriously. So: go ahead and modify any font, just make dead-sure it doesn't leave
    your drive. Unless there's an ethical impediment, which might cost you.\r\n\r\nThe
    things at play here are quality, ethics (not violating a EULA) and economy (not
    commissioning a custom weight). Everybody will find a different balance, but I
    for one class the first highest (unless my own ethics happen to coincide with
    the font house's).\r\n\r\n<blockquote>we're fast approaching the point where you

    not just about what a reader's conscious eye notices; stuff happens -and goes
    wrong- way deeper than that. To be fair though if we're talking about minute amounts
    it's generally OK (although it does depend on the font in question).\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(maybe)

    what I'm really doing is exploring the always-legal ways to modify the appearance
    of font using a layout program, versus the often illegal way by modifying font
    data using a font editor. It is amazing just how much can be done, with no discernable
    difference. \r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nIn passing, I remember your kindness to Richard
    Eckersley at the AAUP meeting -  Toronto, was it? - by agreeing to make up that
    PostScript version of Juliana. I'm sure it wasn't very profitable for you, but
    was much appreciated. A fun gathering of smokers and friends on that hotel balcony
    - users of type - George Mackie, Richard, Mary Mendell, Cameron Poulter, Rich
    Hendel & a couple others..."

  body: "\"...I'm really doing is exploring the always-legal ways to modify the appearance
    of font using a layout program...\"\r\n\r\nSo, it's a font. Is the designer alive?\r\n\r\nReason
    I ask, is I would not use InDesign to stroke a font lighter for a couple of reasons.
    First, it seems that all other stroke-able objects allow one to specify where
    the stroke is going, (inside, outside or on the contour), but nay on fonts.  And
    second, as you see in an <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/bpunnc/full\">\"Illustrator
    vs InDesign\"</a> comparison, InDesign (CS3) cannot seem to stroke simple postscript
    curves. Both treatments contain identical specs for a .5 pt white line, same color
    background, same font, same glyphs. (Look at InDesign's take on the tails of /h
    and /i!? (Maybe it doesn't print this way, but I'd check every glyph I was stroking
    with ID.)\r\n\r\nSo, (and I remember Toronto as a lamb-chop-bone to my throat
    between courses forcing a promise of either Pilgrim or Juliana, and then dessert...
    thanks) \u2014 old school says adjust the process, doesn't it? New school may
    or may not say change the font, but if it's important enough to one, get on with
    it... or is someone gonna come along and say, \"Hey, That's my font, but it's
    so light? I'm gonna get you! \" No. ;)\r\n\r\nI wish we had variation technology
    in the OSs. FB have many of our families in this state, ready willing and able
    to deliver size masters, weights, widths, grades and animations. But the Janitors
    are scared of extending what was designed as extendable, (the SFNT font format).
    \"Adding tables would break every single application on the face of planet earth.\"
    (And then they add tables and wrappers useless to users, that break no new ground,
    but apps still have to rewrite to use 'em.) \r\n\r\nWhat can you do, 'cept go
    underground:)\r\n\r\n"

    a feature... And if it's the latter, is it to make Illustrator more valuable,
    or to forestall bad typography (like how ID doesn't force-Italics, or at least
    makes it harder)?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>is someone gonna come along and say ....</blockquote>\r\n\r\nGlad
    to see agreement on this.\r\nBTW Charles, if you intend to never break a EULA
    I think the first step when you want to modify a font with a no-mod clause is
    to ask the font house for permission; especially if it's a very gentle, across-the-board
    mod they might be pretty likely to say yes. On the other hand modifying a font
    is much more time-consuming (read: expensive) than the sort of solution you seem
    to be looking for, so maybe that's a non-starter.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note here
    BTW is that the latest version of FL has inherited Fontographer's weight-change
    algorithm, which means it's much improved.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>FB have many of
