  \r\n\r\nTo give more context; I have an .otf font file for ZineSlabDisOT, and the
  font name for this font is different on different Flash versions; as shown below
  to be precise:\r\n\r\nMAC Flash CS3 : ZineSlabDis OT\r\nPC Flash CS3 : ZineSlabDisOT\r\nMAC
  Flash CS4 : Zine Slab Display OT\r\nPC Flash CS4 : Zine Slab Display OT\r\n\r\nAfter
  investigating this .otf file in a font editor, I found out that the CS3 MAC-PC name
  discrepency is due to the fact that PC Flash CS3 uses the \"Family Name\" of the
  font and MAC Flash CS3 uses the \"Full Name\"(each .otf font comes with five different
  names). \r\n\r\nI am running into similar font issues with Flash CS4. This time
  I am stumped because I am unable to find out where Flash CS4 gets its font name
  from; CS4 displays a name -- for ex: Zine Slab Display OT -- that doesn't show up
  any where in the font file. \r\n\r\nThank you so very much for your time, consideration
  and insights.\r\nNeelu\r\n\r\n"

    file, you can use <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/code/ttx/index.html\"><strong>ttx</strong></a>;
    ttx also comes with the Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType (<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/\"><strong>AFDKO</strong></a>).\r\n\r\nttx
    -t name fontname.otf\r\n\r\nwill give you the file fontname.ttx with more names
