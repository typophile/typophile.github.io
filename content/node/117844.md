    firm's website features FontDeck fonts, which led me to Maison Mono Bold:\r\nhttp://fontdeck.com/typeface/maisonmono\r\n\r\nAnyone
    else care to weigh in as to whether they think it's a close match?"

    Note the conclusion that this is a custom variation of Milieu Grotesque\u2019s
    Maison Neue Mono created specifically for the TypeCon 2014 identity by Build.\r\nDon"
