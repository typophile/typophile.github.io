  Detroit newspapers have announced that they\u2019re ceasing home delivery</a>. While
  Detroit may have an economy that\u2019s atypically depressed, this is an important
  event in the long-predicted and slow death of the printed newspaper. \r\n\r\nThat
  announcement comes after last week\u2019s news that the Washington Post is continuing
  its death spiral; an article in the Washington City paper has a copy of a potential
  Post plan for the future that includes the possibility of turning the paper into
  a non-profit funded by a trust. Incidentally, the Washington City paper has been
  predicting its own doom for months. The Pulitzer is now open to more online journalism
  than ever before. And the Washington Bureau Chief at Time has so much faith in the
  future of printed news that he\u2019s going to go work for Vice President Joe Biden,
  who isn\u2019t exactly the high-profile member of the new Executive Branch of government.\r\n\r\nSo
  what does the death spiral of the printed news media mean for the type industry?
  More commissions from newspapers and magazines trying to stay relevant with a fresh
  look? Commissions for custom typefaces designed to use with HTML or the new Flash
  Text engine? "

    of reading the paper while laying on the couch with a big mug of coffee is one

    worrying if the site is down or wifi is on the fritz, or if I want to bend a page
    corner over to save my place while I take a nap. Oh, well. I will be 65 next month
    so I assume type on paper will endure longer than I will.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    editor (sorry I can't remember his name) with much regret that they can no longer
    afford to pay his salary and will make do instead with a less capable person at
    the helm. The Age is scaling down its printing and press operations and number
    of journalist staff in response to loss of ad revenue. The general assumption
    is that the internet is taking ad revenue from print.\r\n\r\n<em>Two Detroit newspapers
    have announced that they\u2019re ceasing home delivery.</em>\r\n\r\nIn Australia
    delivery of newspapers to homes is outsourced to newsagents who pay paperboys
    to deliver the newspapers to homes. The shrinking budget of our papers is not
    visible as cutbacks to home delivery. Instead it is visible as cutbacks to newspaper
    staff positions and departments, and scaling down of day to day print operations.\r\n\r\n<em>So
    what does the death spiral of the printed news media mean for the type industry?</em>\r\n\r\nFor
    starters it would help if you didn't fabricate careless labels like \"the death
    spiral\" of printed news media. That's an exaggerated and sensationalist label
    I'm certain the newspaper companies would very much appreciate you not sticking
    onto them. Some of them may read this and wonder if it's a good idea, or not,
    to give typeface design commissions to type designers with loose or errant mouths.\r\n\r\nTo
    answer your question, the shrinking prosperity of printed news media may lead
    to more custom font work for online news media, or it may not. Depends what happens
    in the next five to ten years in the way of computer screen technology. If screen
    resolution improves by one order of magnitude from the current 100 DPI --- to
    1000 DPI or better, the difference between fonts that render well in print and
    those that render well on screen will be much less than it is now.\r\n\r\nIf that
    happens there won't be as much custom font work for screen fonts as some typophilers
    believe. If the order of magnitude improvement in screen resolution occurs soon
    enuff, within the next five years, it may be that many print newspapers will migrate
    to the online medium and survive on business models similar to those used by present
    day online news media services.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    activity, so I hope this prompts newspapers to seriously revise the value of their
    content, and onscreen reading is an entirely different thing, and it's enormously
    dependent on technologies, a thing which printed or incised words have no problem
    about."

    readers that care. \r\n\r\nI'd almost argue that current newsprint type is worse
    than current screen type on a web site. At least on a web site I can tweak to
    suit my tastes, while with the paper, I'm at the mercy of ever cheaper paper and
    fewer pages with more print on it.\r\n\r\n\"For starters it would help if you
    didn\u2019t fabricate careless labels like \u201Cthe death spiral\u201D of printed
    news media.\"\r\n\r\nI don't think that was stating a careless rumor. The newspaper
    industry has been sinking slowly for about a decade now. It's more of a common
    observation.\r\n"
