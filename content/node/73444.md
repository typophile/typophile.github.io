  Academy of art and i really like typography, i'm just starting out so i try to read
  as much as i can about typography in books and here on typophile, very much aware
  that i still need to learn tons i also try and keep busy by having fun with type,
  trying out tutorials, drawing letters...etc\r\n\r\ni was wondering if someone here
  might try and help me explain how the effect in the bottom image was don \"Guerra
  quality meats\" (its painted on the window but wondering if its possible to achieve
  the same effect in illustrator)\r\n\r\ni tought i could get the same effect using
  the \"type on a path\" tool in illustrator by just typing the words on a curved
  line. Obviously it didn't work as you see (the word quality meats), the letters
  don't stand up as in the example where parts of the type looks slanted (?)\r\n\r\nIts
  not for a project or anything, purely for the fact of having some fun and trying
  out/learning new stuff.\r\n\r\nI would immensely appreciate it if someone would
  be kind enough to explain how to acheeve this effect in illustrator (if its even
  possible ofcourse)\r\n\r\nThank you all in advance\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quality

    is the wrong way to go\u2014it will set the type on a path as opposed to reshaping
    type to fit a path."

  body: "thank you so much jabez. i tried it out and it looks indeed more like the
    example i posted. Still doesn't quite look good yet some characters are really
    deformed...i tryed using envelope distort like Dunwich proposed but i get even
    worse results. (don't worry its because of me ofcourse)...mmm i tought this was
    like a pretty eazy effect to achieve, actually its hard to create it and make
    the letters (width..etc) look in balance.\r\n\r\nif any more tips or ways to do
    this i'm all ears :D\r\n\r\nagain thank you Jabez and Dunwich!!"

    it from there.

  body: A simple Effect>Warp>Arch or Arch will do the trick. If you need more control,
    use the Object>Envelope Distort>Make with Mesh. Try to set only one row and one
    column for the mesh, and then play around to learn how to get the exact effect
    you are looking for. Turning on the grid can help if you want to make sure you
    are moving the control handles of the grid equally.

    Then hire a professional type designer to scan and trace the lettering for further
