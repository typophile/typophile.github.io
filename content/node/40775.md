    reconsider stealing sheep. I like your attempt to combine the SU but it also seems
    a bit forced. Try to find something personal about your identity. Consider it
    a portfolio piece and avoid falling back on current fads.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "tiptopvisual...\r\n\r\nI agree with Keena.\r\n\r\nYou'll either have to completely
    clean it up, or make it completely different. Just an idea. TipTop. To me that
    means sharp. You are in communication so having a tipped top in a logo would make
    sense. But I would make it very minimalistic... but please don't make a pencil
    out of it unless it's REALLY original.\r\n\r\nof course just an idea."

  body: do you need 'visual' in the name? 'tiptop' is fun on it's own. Visual doesn't
    seem to add a whole lot.

    if this is how you'd promote yourself.
