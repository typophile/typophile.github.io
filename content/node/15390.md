  and would be greatful if anyone of you big guns can help me out.\r\n\r\n First What
  makes a CE version of a font different from the regular ones? If I am not mistaken
  then CE stands for Central European right? Is the kerning different? Cos i cant
  make out any difference.\r\n\r\n Second can someone tell me how to select a good
  pair of Sans and serif font? Would be fantastic if you can suggest a few so that
  I can start working on a project which involves making a brochure (4 page). Text
  is very important and should be easily readable and hopefully cast a impression.
  Money is of no problem. So doesnt matter even if it is one the costliest fonts.\r\n\r\n
  And lastly your personal favorites!\r\n\r\n Thanks\r\n\r\n LordKV "

  body: It just means that accented characters that are used in Central and Eastern
    Europe are included in the font. Standard Western Latin fonts, which support English,
    Spanish, French, German, and a few other Western European languages, don't usually
    include these characters.

    fonts would automatically include all of the diacri./accent marks now. You never
    know, even in the middle of Iowa, when you might need them.

  body: A lot of OpenType fonts include CE support. The CE designation is a holdover
    from older font formats which had more limited character sets and, therefore,
    couldn't support more than a few languages per font.

    think at this point, it'd be more usefull to do [[Cyrillic]] and [[Greek]] extensions,

    less you'd be interested in diacritics, at least beyond the EU countries. There's
    no money in it. And the only reason there's money in Central/Eastern European
    diacritics is that the EU requires documents to be created in all the union's
    official languages. This in fact seems to be the main reason for the contemporary
    surge in Greek fonts. Fortunately, there is however still craft, decency and graciousness
    in making extended fonts!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "LordKV, I can think of no more exciting contemporary superfamily of type,
    combining sans and serif fonts than Joshua Darden's \"Freight\". You can see the
    fonts on his site: http://www.joshuadarden.com/ , and follow his link to garagefonts/Phil's
    to make your purchase.\r\n\r\nAs for accents... I personally like 'em, and like
    makin' em, even though I have heard people deriding the \"glyph arms race\". I
    was put on to this site - http://www.eki.ee/letter/ - and use it to learn which
    accented letters are necessary for which languages. Referring to this site is
    a good way of adding accents intelligently. If you're a schwa away from your font
    working in Azerbaijani, then you can design those glyphs and add them to your
    font. And when someone asks, \"Does your font support Azerbaijani?\" You can reply,
    \"Yes! And Tatar as well!\"\r\n\r\nBut as for the less esoteric accents which
    are used in Eastern Europe... They are pretty useful to anyone wanting to show
    respect to people whose names contain those accents. (The next step is to learn
    how to pronounce those accented letters.)"

    should have said: \"It makes no difference to the user who  does not require the
    CE glyphs because the rest of the glyphs space and behave just as they would in
    a font that does not contain the CE set of glyphs.\" \r\nI was just trying to

    the rest of the Latin based languages.\r\n\r\n ChrisL"

  body: The reality in Central Europe is little bit different. There are many CE fonts
    (mostly Adobe typefaces) localized in the middle of 90s. Such fonts have completely
    redesigned diacritics - not only for CE characters, but for all accented ones.
    Many western designers don't care about the look of the diacritics and the original
    accents look very ugly. Unfortunately in languages such Czech or Slovak almost
    every word contains at least one accent. Therefore correct shape, size and position
    is very important. Even now, to successfully use new fonts, the change of diacritics
    in many commercially available CE font is a must.

    answers, so I will express my personal prefferences: \r\n\r\nCompatil (with its
    four variants) is awesome.\r\nFF Fago Sans and Serif\r\nFF Quadraat Sans and Serif\r\nFF
    Zine Sans / Serif\r\nFoundry Form Sans ans Serif\r\n\r\nall pretty suitable both
    for display and text setting needs.\r\n\r\nFont Bureau's Stainless and Dispatch
