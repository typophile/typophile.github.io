  with paint buckets.\r\nAny of you know how to do some neat but dirty stuff to make
  a design look either washed out/streets hip and 'hand made'? Please share. Thank
  you!"

    glyph kitchen is a place for exploring type in a variety of media. Forget the
    technological side of type design and return to the physical element of making
    letters, ornaments, words, and sentences - anything typographic. </em>"

    of your original out the edge of the imaging bed and stop it at points as the
    top tracks across. You'll get fun stretchy copies that way\r\n\r\nYou might even
    manage to get that stretchy effect on modern desktop scanners (though you'd have
    to supply motion in the original yourself), but you won't get the grittyness of
    a copier that way."

  body: 'Those <a href="http://www.mrretro.com/">Mister Retro</a> filters are pretty
    slick. I have the original 1st set and have used it a few times to customise t-shirts.
    The new pimped version of the software is even more slick. Seriously customizable
    and you really can tweak the living daylights out of it. Yes, I do think photocopies
    and steel wool are totally valid, but I also think these filters are just as valid. '

    suggested so far is a mechanical technique to artificially \"antique\" some type.
    \r\n\r\nWe're giving the hand-lettering workshop again this year at TypeCon and
    it looks to be very fun. Cut paper, ink, drawn, pen-written, calligraphic, brush-lettered
    and any other kind of handmade lettering. Experimental and low-tech. If you're
    coming to TypeCon, join us. Useful skills if the power goes out.  ;)"

    you'll have to get lino blocks and a set of gouges, but that's half the fun."

    do, but the problem would be getting them to admit it. ;^) I hear sales of those
    filters are quite good. The key to using a tool is to know how and why to use
    them. It is all about subtleties."
