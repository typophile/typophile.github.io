    T seems a little light compared to the rest, almost like it\u2019s from a different
    typeface)"

  body: I recognize everything but the capital T (which IS probably from a different
    font, I agree)... It looks likes a system font that they have on the school computers
    at my school. I can't name it, though...

  body: "It has a lot in common with <a href='http://www.haroldsfonts.com/swizzlescript.html'
    target='_blank'>Swizzle Script</a> - except the r and s are different.\r\n\r\nHow
    old is this? I wonder if those letters could have been alternates in the original
    Stylescript (SolHess, 1940, Monotype). I can tell you that there were no such
    alternates in the VGC version."

  body: Your 's' does indeed appear in someone else's (coincidence?) purported sample
    of Stylescript. <a href='http://typophile.com/node/53294#comment-457998' target='_blank'>See

    but that would explain why I've had little luck tracking this down\u2026\r\n\r\nSwizzle
    Script does seem to be the closest match out there.\r\n\r\nThis is from a piece
    of certificate art produced by my employer during the mid to late 80's, rumor
    has it some sort of film based typesetter was used at that point in time.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the leads guys, now I have a leaping off point :)"
