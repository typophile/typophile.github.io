body: "Since this morning the new font <strong>Symbojet</strong> is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/symbojet/|alive
  at MyFonts]]. (Sorry for the delay, it was just a MF pipeline issue.)\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sym_banner_1_5303.jpg]\r\n.\r\n<strong>Symbojet</strong>
  is the first font product offering letters and symbols alike on the very same high
  level of design and based on <strong>standard encoding</strong>.\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zumBaeren_4693.jpg]\r\n.\r\nComposing
  like that can now be done out of one single font. The combination of text with signage
  was never as easy and elegant.\r\nBoth fonts <cite>Symbojet Regular</cite> and <cite>Symbojet
  Bold</cite> contain an equal number of alphabetic and pictographic glyphs. Most
  of the symbols are based on the new Unicode-6.0 codepoints and are identical in
  both fonts. \r\nEach font contains about 340 letters (Latin for all European languages,
  Greek), 124 alphanumeric characters (circled and squared A\u2013Z and 1\u201310),
  400 symbol glyphs (340 of it having UC/ISO codepoints) and 12 ornaments.\r\nAltogether
  there are more than 1000 glyphs in either font.  \r\nHere is a selection of the
  pictographic repertoire:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/themat_bsp_6206.jpg]\r\n(Please
  go to the MyFonts site for English samples.)\r\n.\r\nNearly all pictographic glyphs
  are related to an underlying circle-square-scheme. So they can get combined with
  circle or square shield glyphs: \r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/geschildete_fbg_3774.jpg]\r\nYou\u2019ll
  \uFB01nd those combining glyphs in both fonts, at the bottom of listing in glyph
  palette windows.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, you can do not only serious wayfinding
  and public signage work with Symbojet. Use it for eye-catchig restaurant menus,
  beach banners, private mailings and funny birthday cards as well.\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Symbo_banner_ship_5845.png]\r\n.\r\nRead

  body: "Please note that the Regular style <strong>is available as a single font</strong>
    as well.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what is currently ongoing at Myfonts, they behaved
    *very* strange with this release. I apologize for that.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as long
    as Symbojet Regular is wrongly priced \u201C$68\u201D at the MF site, I offer
    an introductory special price of only $35 for direct delivery (to be payed via
    PayPal).\r\n[[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=7&changelang=2|-->

    combining symbols are an excellent addition to OT features. Hope SymbolJet open
    a new trend on this.\r\n\r\nBTW, I visited MF and it seems to be working now."
