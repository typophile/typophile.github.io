body: "Hi guys! \r\nAfter a lot of months working on a typeface I tried to export
  it. There are however some opentype features that doesn't work well in some software.
  \r\n\r\nIllustrator CS3 and InDesign CS3:\r\n- Missing kern pairs\r\n- small caps
  not working (small caps do work in InDesign CS3)\r\n- superscript letters (this
  I don't know if I programed correctly. I've made for instance \u201Ca.sups\u201D)\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone could help me that would be great.\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The superscript letters are now working in illustrator but not in in design.\r\nThe
    kerning though is missing some pair in both illustrator and in Design but in the
    text editor they appear just fine.\r\nCan't really get the reason of this problem?\r\nHas
    anyone had anything similar?\r\nThanks again"

  body: InDesign is sensitive to the language you assigned to your features. Perhaps
    the fault lies in there.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kern_6476.gif]\r\nThe language is all
    set to default. Is this a problem?\r\nBut what really freaks me out is the fact
    that some kernings work and others don't (see image). How is this possible?\r\nThanks"

  body: "Are you using class kerning?  Are all the offending glyphs in their proper
    class? Is the left or right kerning check set properly?  Have you updated kerning
    from Kerning Assistance menu?\r\n\r\nFrom your picture, I can see that kerning
    n the left side of W and V is not working but it s on the right side.  Check tat
    check box on the V/W kerning class."

  body: "Ok I've overcome the kerning problem. It seems I had too much kern pairs
    in one single subtable, I divided it along other subtable and its now ok. \r\n\r\nBut
    Small Caps still doesn't work in Illustrator, It's just scaling down the Caps...\r\nAny
    ideas? \r\n\r\nThanks!"
