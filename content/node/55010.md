body: "I've been through a couple of the introductory lessons, but still need something
  even more basic: Why care about type?\r\n\r\nI'm not being facetious. I sense there
  are reasons, both rational and emotional, that the way a word looks, matters --
  but that's only intuitive for me.\r\n\r\nThen, what I'd love to see is a lesson
  or essay describing the principles: How to make basic choices for HTML/Flash vs
  print, animated vs static, etc. I know sans-serif generally is easier to read on
  a screen, and serif is easier to read on paper (in terms of human factors/reading
  speed); that too many fonts is called \"ransom noting\"; that people read fastest
  at about 12 words per line -- but that's where my decision-making knowledge ends.\r\n\r\nMaybe
  that's too low-brow for Typophile, but I hope not. :) \r\n\r\nI enjoy this stuff.
  I just don't know what to do with it."

    rest, there are a lot of rules of thumb. A lot of them aren't necessarily based
    on terribly tangible research, though."
