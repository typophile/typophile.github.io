body: "Hello typophiles,\r\n\r\nI have just finished vectorizing all the letters on
  my first ever typeface endeavour. Please tell me what you think of it. So far I've
  traced my pen drawings in fontlab without a lot of further adjustment. I would like
  to keep (some of) the irregularities (the inconsistent serifs for example) as part
  of the font's character. What would this need to become a useful, playful typeface?\r\n<img
