  body: "EDITED\r\nPresumably this is an old sign found in The Netherlands. In my
    opinion it was probably not based on a single font, but was created from models
    familiar to the sign-maker, such as Britannic -- which was in use from 1901 onwards
    and has the notched spur on G -- and Chambord available after WWII. Note for example
    the general letter-form of _S_ and _G_. Also note the degree of contrast is very
    similar to the sign.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chambord1946_5687.jpg]\r\nChambord
    \ was designed by French graphic and poster designer Roger Excoffon and released
    in 1952 by the Fonderie Olive. I believe it was used for various purposes by the
    French railway company and this may have been where it was noticed by our Dutch
    sign-maker. All speculation of course.\r\nDon"
