body: "I started a new job recently and I have the opportunity to re-brand my company's
  corporate identity. We are a large construction company in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe
  typefaces we currently use are Garamond and Helvetica. They are both beautiful and
  I love them but <strong>everyone</strong> else loves them too. I was originally
  debating whether or not we should even change them but I eventually came to the
  conclusion that I would like to go with something not quite as common. Do you agree?
  I heard a good quote that helped me make this decision \u201CDifferent is always
  better but better is always different.\u201D\r\n\r\nI realize that whatever I go
  with will not be completely unique to my company. I am fine with that. I don't want
  to be original at the expense of being good but I would like to at least find something
  that isn't on practically every truck, sign, brochure, and ad that I look at. \r\n\r\nIdeally
  I would like to find a hidden gem that is well done and not overused (if such a
  thing exists). Something that will have credibility with the most experienced typographers,
  but also looks good to everyone else.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has suggestions I would greatly
  appreciate it. The department is small enough and the company is large enough where
  budget isn't really an issue. I have a few ideas in mind that it would be nice to
  have some feedback on as well. I am coming up with options for three concepts.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  <strong>Bold and proven.</strong> So far I am leaning towards [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100034&path=head|Sentinel]],
  [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013&path=head|Knockout]],
  [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100019&path=head|The
  Proteus Project]], and [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100031&path=head|Chronicle]].
  Chronicle will be used sparingly, it will be reserved for occasions where we would
  like to be fancy such as formal invitations. Think of it as business formal. I realize
  that Hoefler and Frere-Jones fonts are well known but I have not seen them nearly
  as much as Helvetica and Garamond.\r\n\r\n\u2022 <strong>Family owned, traditional,
  values.</strong> I haven't really come up with anything for this one yet.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  <strong>Gritty and tough.</strong> For this one I was thinking [[http://www.christianschwartz.com/amplitude.shtml|Amplitude]]
  and [[http://www.christianschwartz.com/farnham.shtml|Farnham]]. The etchings on
  Amplitude give it characters that I think fits and the strong serifs on Farnham
  convey a tough, sturdy feeling."

  body: "The Proteus Project would provide a nice toolkit of strong and varied type.
    I'll bet you'll find a fair number of bold slab serifs in the construction industry
    once you start looking, though.\r\n\r\nAs for hidden gems, the rapid pace of type
    development/release these days means there are dozens of offerings from small
    foundries that haven't gotten their due. Look at releases from TypeTrust, Suitcase,
    Process Type Foundry, Village, A2 Type, You Work For Them, Lineto, among (many)
    others."

  body: "Sentinel (and also Chronicle, but less fitting here in my opinion) are great,
    versatile typefaces and, as marcox said already, Proteus will probably lend itself
    for logos and display applications for a construction company. Personally I have
    seen too much Knockout lately. \r\n\r\nMaybe it is because I worked with it for
    the last weeks, but I think Amplitude would be a really good fit and comes in
    many different styles. And then you can add Sentinel or something similar for
    a bit more grace."

  body: "Thank you Kupfers. I have seen a lot of Knockout lately too. Anything by
    Hoefler and Frere-Jones probably runs the risks off falling into the overexposed
    category. If not now then some day. I don't think I have ever seen Amplitude used
    anywhere else. Of course once I start using it everyday without a doubt I'm sure
    I will start seeing it pop up more.\r\n\r\nI agree that Chronicle seems less fitting.
    Sometimes we need to create formal pieces so this is where I see Chronicle coming
    into play. I don't know though, I suppose a slab such as Sentinel could work for
    that though. Maybe just use it in light or use the italic. Plus four typefaces
    might be getting to be a bit much."

  body: "Yeah, then I\u2019d say, get Amplitude and Williams Caslon Text. I think
    the latter is the perfect middle course between sturdy and sophisticated. Also
    has a very nice, elegant italic."

  body: What do you think about Farnham? I think it has a similar feel to Williams
    Caslon Text but it has more styles and is also by Christian Schwartz. Although
    it's not necessary I like the idea of pairing fonts created by the same designer.

  body: 'Christian Schwartz is a fabulous designer. Farnham is designed to sparkle,
    and Williams Caslon to be serene. So it depends on the look you want, but they
    are going to be very different, I think. Amplitude has sparkle at large sizes
    because of the deep ink traps. There''s also a [[http://christianschwartz.com/amphead.shtml|Headline
    version]] of Amplitude without ink traps. For Christian Schwartz and Paul Barnes''

    it <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/84831#comment-475265\">everywhere today</a>
    :)\r\n\r\nWilliam explained it well \u2014 it depends on what you\u2019re aiming
    at. That both typefaces are from the same designer might help (or feel safe) in
    other instances, but those two are very different in proportions and form. Or
    do you mean because of the \u201Csparkling\u201D inktraps?\r\n\r\nI think Amplitude
    would work with a lot of seriffed typefaces. Maybe even your good old Garamond
    can come to new shine next to it. If you don\u2019t need the serif this often,
    why not start with Amplitude and see how far you get? I\u2019m doing a book about
    dance with it at the moment and find it quite elegant all by itself already."
