  I am working on a research project about Arial and it would be great to hear some
  expert opinions about this strange typeface.\r\nI have already read [[http://www.ms-studio.com/articles.html|this]]
  great article by Mark Simonson. It would be very nice if some of the typedesigners
  in this forum could help me and write a few words. Thank you!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\np.s.:
  Please excuse my bad english."

    shop which produces fonts for every script in the world, and the fullest sets
    of characters. So whatever you think of Arial\u2014and personally I agree with
    Mark\u2014it has a mind-blowingly complete set of glyphs and compatible forms
    in other scripts. Perhaps in competition, though, Linotype now has a World version
    of Helvetica.   "

  body: "Thank you very much for your answers!\r\n\r\n@William:  I agree with you,
    I guess this is one of the main reasons why arial is so popular.\r\n\r\n@frank:
    do you (or anyone else here) have any background information about the hinting
    of arial? was it hinted that extensively from start? or has it been refined during
    the years of its existance?\r\n \r\n\r\nDo you think that arial (as world\u2019s
    most popular typeface) will soon be replaced by another typeface? \r\n\r\nAre
    there any Typedesigners in this forum who like arial?\r\n\r\nI wonder if someone
    could recommend some websites/books about the topic? (couldn\u2019t find very
    much)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGeorg"

    and appreciation, but Arial is merely the default sans serif, having been bundled
    by Microsoft.\r\n\r\nArial is not a clone of Helvetica, in fact Helvetica is a
    much closer derivation of Akzidenz Grotesk."

  body: It's a funny thing. As Frode says, it works on screen very well. For me that's
    its only use because in vector form it's just a warped and needless ugly cousin
    of Helvetica, which is itself overused.

  body: "I guess so. It does have some cachet with designers who don't have a lot
    of formal typographic background and like the \"neutrality\" of the grotesque
    genre. Also they may prefer it as being \"the neutral sans for left-brain PC users\",
    if they identify Helvetica as being the Mac/right brain equivalent\r\n\r\nHowever,
    isn't it also true that a lot of sales of Arial are for purposes of corporate
    standardisation, to fill out peripheral sectors of a business' licensing requirements,
    where Arial is not available bundled, although it has become the corporate face
    due to being bundled for the business' core requirements? That too would constitute
    a \"get it because we have to\" scenario, rather than \"get it because we like
    and prefer it\".\r\n\r\nFurther on the Helvetica Clone/Spot the Difference meme:
    the same exercise could be carried out with a lot of faces, eg Frutiger and Myriad,
    with similar effect for the lay person. \r\n\r\nIMO Robin Nicholas' design of
    Arial is informed by the Grotesque genre in general, and what most draws it into
    direct comparison with Helvetica is the fact that it has the same (or very similar?)
    metrics; and Akzidenz Grotesk is not so well known.\r\n\r\nAs has been pointed
    out at Typophile before, Arial looks a bit ropey at display sizes: any plans for
    an Arial Next, Allan?"

    (like in PowerPoints, for example), or for all situations, because they know every
    PC is likely to have it. \r\n\r\nAlso, many corporations list Arial as the backup
    font. Their brand standards manual will says something like \"If [corporate font]
    is not available, you may substitute Arial\"."

    to Monotype Grotesque as Helvetica is to Akzidenz Grotesk \u2013 they're both
    ultimately children of older, 19th century san serifs. Macuser had a decent [[http://www.monotypefonts.com/PDFs/Twenty20_080705.pdf|article
