  a free version of it on the web back in 2003/2004 and used it to create this. (It's
  no longer on my computer). I checked under MyFonts, and the closest is 'Archive
  Modern II', except that uses lowercase letters. This font has lowercase as smaller
  uppercase.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRay"

  body: "I am closing this now. The free font that is closest is Bodoni Open. Using
    uppercase in a smaller size to accomplish the same look. The font that is the
    closet in style is Archive Modern II Open. Same as above, need to use smaller
    uppercase to accomplish the results. The Archive Modern II Open cost $20.\r\n\r\nRay"
