  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This is something I&rsquo;ve wondered for a while. Given that Microsoft originally shipped Windows with Book Antiqua, and then eventually started licensing a legit version of Palatino, it would seem like a possibility that they could do the same for Arial/Helvetica. Granted, Book Antiqua wasn&rsquo;t as ubiquitous as Arial is, and thus was easier to abandon. But it seems they&rsquo;re paying more attention towards design and following more of designers' advice in their recent software, so does anyone ever see this happening?</div>

<p>Arial works better as a text face, and often renders better on screen.</p>
<p>The latter is getting less of an issue, but Microsoft generally favours practicality over design purity and occasionally goes out of its way to support legacy software.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Windows <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3.1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> introduced TrueType fonts, and largely as a result of that, it was a success where Windows 3.0 had been largely ignored (Microsoft even had a deal with Logitech were you could get a free copy of Windows 3.0 when you bought a Logitech mouse).</p>
<p>Arial, although width-compatible with Helvetica, is derived from the font outlines of a Monotype sans-serif typeface, and thus it&rsquo;s a legitimate typeface. Various approximations and imitations of Helvetica are available cheaply or for free to Windows users, so the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t come with Windows is not really a problem for anyone who has a document to print on a laser printer for which Helvetica would look right, and Monotype Grotesque would look wrong.</p>
<p>That being said, though, I can understand why an attitude of &lsquo;who cares&rsquo; might be rejected. Not that Arial is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> typeface, but Helvetica is historically significant, and it has aesthetic qualities which are well recognized. I think Helvetica Medium is quite beautiful on signage myself.</p>
<p>And, so, having that as an automatic default - as most computer users care little and know less about typography - would presumably contribute to an elevation of typographic taste or some such thing.</p>
<p>Of course, Helvetica, like Times Roman, is so highly popular that it has its detractors as well. I&rsquo;m not one to reject a typeface merely because it&rsquo;s popular. I&rsquo;m not even particularly hostile for Papyrus - I think it fills its particular niche quite well, a niche for which there is a lot of demand these days.</p>
<p>But I might be sympathetic enough to those critical of Helvetica to express the wish that if Microsoft were to include a copy of Helvetica with every copy of Windows, they might also spring for a copy of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Univers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well. (I suppose people would have to get Microsoft Word to have Franklin Gothic and News Gothic as alternate choices.)</p>
<p>Helvetica, beautiful as it is, is more of a display sans-serif than a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->text<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sans-serif, while, although I find Univers bland and uninspiring by comparison, I have to admit that it better fills the role of a text face.</p>
<p>Of course, it would also be nice if people could choose Century Expanded or Baskerville in Windows, instead of just Georgia, as a serif alternative to Times Roman. Again, one has more choices if one springs for Microsoft Office.</p>
