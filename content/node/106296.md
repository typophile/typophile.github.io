body: "I have a TrueType font that I created using FontStruct, an easy but rather
  limited web-based tool. It is a \"pixel\" font, intended to display only at a certain
  size (or integer multipliers thereof), so scale is important.\r\n\r\nThe issue is,
  my font is rendered at *double* the intended size.  At least in Windows, it only
  looks right at a size of 6pt - less than most programs would allow you to select.
  \ I'd like to halve the scale of the font; in other words, I want to see at 12pt
  what I currently see at 6pt.\r\n\r\nIn FontForge, I've tried doubling the Em Size
  (under Font Information -> General), without scaling the outlines.  This didn't
  help, and neither did doubling the metrics to match (under OS/2 -> Metrics).\r\nAny
  tips on how to accomplish this, either using FontForge or some other free tool?"

    Appreciated!
