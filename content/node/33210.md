body: "Have you heard about <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/mars/\"><strong>Mars</strong></a>,
  an Adobe project for representing PDF files in a XML-based format? A Mars file is
  essentially a ZIP file containing all the document's assets (text, raster images,
  vector images, video, sound, fonts), in industry's standard file formats such as
  SVG, PNG, JPG, JPG2000, OpenType, Xpath and XML.\r\n\r\nBut, wait a minute, does
  that mean that my font files will be placed inside a Mars file, and that anyone
  using an application to unzip it will get access to them?!?!\r\nThe answer is <strong>NO</strong>.
  The fonts are embedded in a Mars file \u2014 just like in a standard PDF file \u2014,
  but you won't find the fonts themselves inside it. Phew! :^)\r\n\r\nIf you're the
  kind of person that needs to see in order to believe it (like I am), then have a
  look at the Mars file attached to the bottom of this post. <strong>Make sure you
  follow the instructions first!!</strong>\r\n\r\nAs you'll see, when you look inside
  a Mars file, this is what you get: A bunch of files and folders, but definitely
  no OpenType (.ttf or .otf) font files.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/content_6410.png]\r\n\r\n<strong>########################################\r\nREAD
  ME FIRST</strong>\r\nThe file below named <strong>Mars_file.pdf</strong> is a Mars
  file, BUT had to be disguised as a standard PDF file, because otherwise Typophile
  wouldn't allow it to be uploaded and attached. To revert that <strong>change its
  current .pdf extension to .mars</strong>. The other file (PDF_file.pdf) is a standard
  PDF file.\r\n\r\nIf you want to peek inside the Mars file, just change its extension
  to .zip and unpack it with a regular unzip application.\r\n\r\nTo open a Mars file,
  go to the <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/mars/\">Mars Project page</a>,
  download the plug-in for Adobe Reader 8 and install it. (You'll need Adobe Reader
  8 installed as well, obviously. But it's free and much slick and faster than the
  previous versions, so go for it!)\r\n\r\nIn case you have Adobe Acrobat 8, download
  the Mars plug-in for it as well. This will add a new entry, named <em>Adobe PDF
  in XML format</em>, to the list of file formats that Acrobat is able to save. This
  new option enables you to save standard PDF files into Mars files.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/acrobat_option_4397.png]"

    'standards compliant' yet 'wholly proprietary' file formats.\r\n\r\nFYI, all of
    MS's new file formats are using the same construct. XML + assets put together
    in a single ZIP file. This will be true for most MS Office files and Infopath.\r\n\r\n"
