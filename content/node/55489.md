body: "Hey Guys,\r\nThe company I work for currently designs a corporate magazine
  that deals with news/issues around the business/financial world i.e articles from
  banks, law firms, solicitors etc. The Mag is currently coming up for its 100th issue
  and the editors are thinking of a possible re-design/face lift for the mag. The
  mag is currently set in Frutiger LT throughout, which is used in various weights
  for body copy, captions, Headlines etc. Anyway... I thought it could be beneficial
  to open up to this forum to maybe get some suggestions for new typefaces to use
  for the re-design.\r\n\r\nAs it stands at the min I think the editors are keen to
  retain a san serif for the main body copy. The only other restrictions are that
  it should remain quite clean and 'corporate' looking. We were maybe thinking of
  introducing a fine slab serif font so any suggestions of families with san serif
  and slab serif variations would be welcome. At the moment the re-design is at the
  earliest stage so any suggestions are welcome... even if you think are a little
  left field. Thank you... and I look forward to any suggestions. "

  body: I'd recommend looking at the [[http://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/thesis-family/about/|Thesis]]
    family. It's comprised of a sans, serif and mix. Clean and corporate, but not
    dull.

  body: No... No budget for custom type design...even though a lot of the magazine's
    clients are large corporations the publishing company behind the magazine are
    a fairly small operation and tend to keep the budget as tight as possible. Thanks
    for your recommendations so far... I look forward to any more...

  body: "I think the main desirable idea now in the field of finance is trustworthiness.
    Fonts that used to look \"corporate\" (think narrow, formal) now look like something
    you want to throw a molotov cocktail at. So I think you need to find a font that's
    honest, warm but still very serious. To me a wide slab serif or wedge serif font
    would be just the thing. Slab serifs are the most honest but tend to be cold,
    while wedge serifs are still quite honest but warmer (and easier to read for long
    text). I have trouble recommending a sans here.\r\n\r\nFor slab serifs I'd say
    Chris's suggestion of Thesis is very good. You might look at Silica as well (FYI
    it doesn't have italics, but it does have a fine gradation of weights). For wedge
    serifs there are a few I like, but I don't feel too guilty first recommending
    my Patria. It was actually designed around this theme of humane, trustworthy competence.
    It's like a quiet wise uncle with a smile in his eyes. Below is a quick PDF, but
    please give me your email address (mine is hpapazian at gmail dot com) if you'd
    like to see more.\r\n\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/ad/CR.pdf\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: If you decide to move away from sans serif, and you want to align yourself
    with another stalwart in your industry, <em>Fortune</em> magazine is using my
    [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman|Whitman]] typeface. However, that might
    just as easily argue against it, I suppose.
