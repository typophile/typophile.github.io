  typophile minds.\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a corporate identity project requiring
  that I research fonts in common usage in the years 1870 - 1900. I have thought of
  a few ways to do this. Microfilm being the most efficient. \r\n\r\nCan you suggest
  other ways of going about this please?\r\n\r\nAlso can you suggest where I could
  find authentic fonts from that era?\r\n\r\nThank you very much"

    specify the year a font (or an earlier version of a font) was created. This will
    of course give you initial dates of use, but fonts created 100 or more years before
    1870 might still be in use.\r\n\r\nRather than microfilm, you might find that
    a university library is a good hunting ground for old type. A long established
    library will have many books on the shelves that are over 100 years old."

  body: "thank you! I had not thought of the Uni Library. Let's hope the local schools
    have what I'm looking for. \r\n\r\nI have been getting closer to what I'm looking
    for.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to study typefaces such as the ones found in the GRAND
    THEATRE and BLACKPOOL posters found [[http://www.blackpoolcircusschool.co.uk/circus_history.html|here]]\r\n\r\nAnd
    the stuff Christopher H. Bing used in his re-design of \"Casey at the Bat\" in
    2000. \r\n\r\nIt's the first time in my life as a designer that type strikes a
    deep and resonant nearly emotional chord in me. \r\n\r\nLink\r\n[[http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=62-1929766009-0|here]]\r\n(sorry,
    no pics of the interior spreads which are stellar! That first spread blew me away!
    I finally understood the genius behind the genuine typesetters of the era he was
    emulating.)\r\n\r\nI simply must study this further. I am quite possessed by this
    in fact.\r\n\r\n"

    they were created as woodcuts. I've long harboured a fantasy of building a font
    based on one of these, a Grand Trunk Railway timetable from about that time.\r\n\r\nI
    just looked, and can't find a link to it, but you might find the two sites below
    of interest. Railway and Steamship schedules of that era should have similar work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sullboat.com/1883%20Timetable,%20Cover.jpg\r\nhttp://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/trains/h30-2061-e.html#f"

    something while watching \"The Illusionist\". A poster that simply says EISENHEIM
    I can not find an image. Anyone know what I'm reffering to? Where I could get
    my hands on fonts of that nature?"
