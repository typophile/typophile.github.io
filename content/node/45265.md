  to mind the 1980s, and has asked me for some font recommendations. He recognizes
  an '80s font when he sees one, but he can't remember font names to save his life.
  When I think of '80s typography, the first thing that comes to mind is Remedy. Arquitectura
  and Lithos, though technically '90s fonts, also make me think of the Reagan administration.
  Does anyone have any recommendations I can pass on? He'd really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nAHL"

  body: "You can also use '1980s' in the search window at sites like MyFonts and FontShop.
    Some results seem questionable (at first glance), but many are correct, even if
    some typefaces were renamed to avoid revival copyright issues. \r\n\r\nAnother
    place to look would be the ever-popular Phil's Photo book \"Homage to the Alphabet\"
    from 1985. Those are film types, but many have been digitized.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
