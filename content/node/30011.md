  body: Wow, how did you end up at FS Norway's page? FontShop USA's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/products/fontbook.cfm">FontBook
    product page</a> is number 4 in the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=fontbook">Google
    results for "FontBook"</a>. And there's always <a href="http://www.fontbook.com">FontBook.com</a>.
