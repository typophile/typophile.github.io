body: "Dear readers,\r\n\r\nI am trying to do metrics for my italic serif-face Canap\xE9,
  but I'm stuck right at the beginning...\r\n\r\nFor upright designs, I usually would
  space the \"o\" symmetrically, assigning (for example) 40em/1000 on each side of
  it. For \"n\" I would do similar.\r\nWhen testing the settings with \"nnnnn\" and
  \"ooooo\", this looks ok, and when typing \"nonon\", it's even as well. But not
  for italics obviously...\r\n\r\nWhen doing the same thing here, the \"nonon\"-combination
  looks very uneven. It would only help to assign asymmetrical space on the \"n\"
  (i.e. 10 left, 50 right instead of 30 on both sides), shifting it into the right
  place, but this is not very practical. Even more, the \"o\" has to stay symmetrically
  spaced, otherwise the effect is cancelled. So this is very inconsistent and will
  lead to problems I assume.\r\n\r\nCan anybody tell me how to do this right? At the
  moment I just don't get where the problem is...\r\n\r\nThanks for your help\r\nSebilar"

  body: "Sebilar,\r\nTake this as my opinion, not fact. The dilemma with italic o
    is that the point of closest proximity on the left side is below center (about
    60% down) and the point of closest proximity on the right side is above center.
    When you have a letter like n with a serif at bottom right but none at tp next
    to \"o\", the serif is in close proximity to the low left protrusion of the o
    making the 2 seem close together there. The left side of the n has serifs both
    top and bottom which makes it necessary to compensate by using a wider left sidebearing
    on the n. \r\nThe solution is to consider the centering vector you measure from
    to be a diagonal equal to the angle of inclination used to slant the italic. I
    usually set sidebearings on italic by setting a string of glyphs interspersed
    with the vertical bar.  If you can balance sidebearings this way, making compensations
    for adjoining shape differences become more predictable.\r\nI hope this makes
    sense to anyone other than me :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Sebilar, do you know <a href=\"http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.1a/2.3.1.01.notes.htm\">Briem's
    site</a> on type design? He partly explains Walter Tracy's method of spacing from
    'Letters of Credit'. In this method in the roman the right side of the n usually
    has less space than the left. He also discusses italic. \r\n\r\nOne important
    thing to remember, also from Tracy, is that when doing spacing, particularly for
    the italic, it may be best to modify the letters if they don't space well. "

  body: "The measuring line in FontLab is very helpful when adjusting the sidebearings
    on slanted glyphs. For italics, I usually set it to half the x-height. There will
    be cases when it does not work (glyphs with open sides like c and s), but those
    should be done by eye anyway.\r\n\r\nThe \"vertical bar\" trick that Chris mentions
    needs a little clarification, I think. What I do is draw a rectangle. I then slant
    it to the same angle as the italic and then set the sidebearings to zero using
    the measurement line. This slanted rectangle can then be used as a spacing aid
    in the metrics window."

  body: 'Any mathematical rule you follow for roman is likely to be useless for Italics.
    See the point about different serif structure, and what that does to numerical
    sidebearings. The object is to space each letter so it fits with each other. Math
    and symmetry are red herrings here. It ought to be a visual process. LC o is probably
    the only lowercase italic letter that can be spaced that way. Use o as a basis
    for subsequently spacing the other glyphs optically. Keep in mind that Caps will
    have even more asymmetrical sidebearings, since they are taller and intrude further
    to the right. You simply have to decide what part of the letter is centered (middle
    of x-height, top of lc, baseline, whatever), and then space everything pleasantly.
    It might help to look at the spacing of the Roman while working on the spacing
    of the lowercase, but I don''t think you will be able to use a formula or methematical
    rule. '

  body: "Thanks a lot for the tips and links, I am \"on the road again\" and doing
    some testing and corrections already. Maybe it was just getting over the beginner's
    innate inhibition to start without knowing what will come out.\r\nOf course crossgrove
    is right: Math is useless here (it worked quite well on the roman though).\r\n\r\nSome
    minor modifications on the letters did solve the worst problems, most of it was
    just doing it by sure eye.\r\n\r\nTracy was not very helpful in this case, but
    deciding which part of the letter shall be centered, and follow that principle
    throughout, was. I still have problems with the measure line and how it could
    help me, I'll have to explore into that. I understand the principle, it's just
    getting used to it yet. Is it to automate some of the work? Or is it to aid in
    manual working?\r\n\r\nAnd I think I also understand the method with the \"vertical\"
    bar or the slanted rectangle. But do you draw the rectangle around the whole letter
    (including serifs) or just the \"main part\" of them?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSebilar\r\n\r\n\r\nPS.:
    I wish there would be a \"designing type\" for italics ;-)"

    The slanted rectangle should be a separate character. You can put it anywhere
    it's convenient--the non-breaking space for example. You can then type it before,
    after, or between the characters you're working on in the Metrics window. You
    can also use it with the measurement line. When your spacing is done, you delete
    the slanted rectangle.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slanted-rect_5677.gif]"
