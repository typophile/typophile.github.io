    Looks \"most probably custom\" to me (possibly no optical correction on /p descender),
    everything redrawn starting from /o (/c = /o - cut ; /p = /o + vertical stroke).
    2 solutions, the quick way [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dsgnhaus/saturn|Saturn]]
    (but outlines don't perfectly match) and the (not so) long way [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/reversal|Reversal]]

  body: Ryuk, thank you for your help! Are these types in the category as Geometric
    or Humanist? I'm finding some similar fonts listed in those two categories. I'm
    still searching for the right font to use. Many that I see on golf packaging are
    eye-catching and I'm looking in that direction. Thanks again for your help!

    (I can easily imagine it on spacecraft door). Second is simply \"very Eurostile\"
    to me.\r\nYou can have a look to [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Typodermic|Ray

    at this moment is [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Biome|Carl Crossgrove Biome]].\r\nMy
    2 cent now. Using this kind of fonts is visually risky. They're surely cheesy
    and appealing, love them at first sight but they're far from being timeless, you
    can get tired of them very quickly."

  body: "Thank you for your time and sharing your thoughts, which I really appreciate.
    I like your viewpoint in that these fonts are cheesy but appealing and that we
    can rapidly tire of them as opposed to those that are timeless. I agree with you
    regarding Biome and the Pro Semi Bold looks fantastic. \r\n\r\nThe project I'm
    working on entails a logo for a hiking tour/guide who currently has a standard
    logo. The one I'm looking to design is one for a weekend hike taking place, which
    will not be used for long-term. Some shirts, brochures, water bottles, and keepsakes
    will be made for the special occasion. \r\n\r\nIt will read \"higher\" (upper
    case/lower case to be determined) and I was looking for inspiration. \r\nI came
    across this backpack at [[http://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/EddieBauer/EB12IA_0231792_300C1?qlt=90,0&op_sharpen=1&resMode=bicub&maskUse=norm&rgn=0,0,0,0&align=0,-1|Eddie
    Bauer]] as the color caught my eye. The logo seems clean and to the point. My
    guess is they're using Helvetica, possibly? \r\n\r\nThe logo at the top of the
    pack and the name at the bottom of the pack as well, are the ones I'm looking
    at. I'm interested in possibly using a type similar to this. I'm going to look
    at the glyphs on the fonts you've linked to and see how the letters may look.
    \r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\n "
