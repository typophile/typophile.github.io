body: "We've extended the sale on our new \"Across the Univers\" shirt http://typographyshop.com/univers_w_t-shirt.html
  through September 14th. We got our first mailing out to our buyers a bit late and
  wanted to give them more time.\r\n\r\nNearly 40% of the buyers of this shirt also
  bought our first, \"Helvetica Neue Descending a t-shirt.\" Talk about customer loyalty.\r\n\r\nAs
  several of them came from here, I want to thank this vibrant community for being
  so supportive of this new venture.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/univwhtank_5502.jpg]"
