    for example, a \"pylon\" is a kind of projecting strut or stick-shaped structure
    used for mounting components like engines, equipment nacelles, pods, bridge sections,
    girders.\r\n\r\nThe only sense I can think of in which that applies to a lettering

  body: "Now the image/idea of stencil-fixing stencils is really fun. That seems like
    a rich area for invention. The first stencil can be half of the letter, or just
    bits, with any missing bits filled in. Cryptic possibilities, or fun multicolored
    lettering.  For that matter, one stencil could be robots or traffic cones, and
    the other can fill in the rest, making letters....\r\n\r\nThat reminds me of things
    printed in a jumble of red and blue, and red glasses reveal the hidden message.
    \r\n\r\nAnd that reminds me of watching Creature from the Black Lagoon in 3-D
    recently. \r\n\r\nAnd that reminds me of the cheese-flavored popcorn we ate.....
    \r\n\r\nYou know the rest. "

    >:o)\r\n\r\nYour site looks great, and the name is perfect for the application.\r\n\r\nThe
    most obvious difference between a pylon and a bridge is that one is a vertical
    stricture and the other is horizontal. generally speaking the operation of cutting
    stencils is a]carried out on a flat table, so the pylons resemble bridges, whereas
    when stencils are being designed or used, they are most often in a vertical position,
    so the bridges resemble pylons.\r\n\r\nwords and jargon are endlessly fun, aren't
    they? \r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"
