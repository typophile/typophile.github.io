body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am hoping someone here might be able to hep me identify my
  font.  I've already used several online font identification sites, but I cannot
  seem to find the match.  I used a font found on a free site to create the graphics
  on my blog, at http://www.styleitonline.com.  Since that time (a year and a half
  ago) I have lost the font files and the original graphics, so I am unable to create
  more graphics with the same font. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know which font I used to
  create the Style IT portion of my banner? I'm very grateful for your help!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nSarah"
