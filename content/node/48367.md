  body: "I like the goose and the colors you've chosen. I think there are a few changes
    that need to be made to the type though.\r\n\r\nIs the \".com\" necessary? - This
    is for a town isn't it?\r\n\r\nI wouldn't do the glassy effect on the type as
    it's been done to death and I don't think it suits a logo for a town - to me it
    suggests a more programming/internet type company.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary style
    sans-serif font along with the effect you have on it AND the \".com\" give this
    a very modern, cold feel. It's too corporate. I'd suggest removing the reflection
    effect, removing the \".com\" and perhaps changing the font to one with a little
    more character. (though the font selection may be fine once the glassy effect
    is removed).\r\n\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: The ".com" was also a requirement in both of the logos. The logo is actually
    for a city website which I forgetfully neglected to mention. I think I might agree
    with taking away the gloss. I'll make some revisions and play around with some
    fonts.

  body: "Your design is nicely done but I agree with pennANDink. in it's current state
    your logo looks very slick and corporate. Why the goose? Is it the town symbol/mascot?
    With a goose I think of a northern mountain town with a lake, lots of fishing,
    hiking, boating, nature preserves etc. What is the town really like? Your contemporary
    sans doesn't seem like an appropriate choice. \r\n\r\nbtw, I also like your Rosetown
    logo design."

  body: "I think this is well executed but perhaps you could supply us with more information.
    Where is the city located? Why does the goose need to be included? Why such a
    corporate colour palette? Why such a punchy sans serif? I think more information
    is required before we can judge whether this is a good or bad design.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Christopher,\r\n\r\nvery good start. Is that gradient on the letters really
    necessary though? It might look better without. I have seen a very similar goose
    somewhere else on this forum before. Let me see if I can find it...\r\n\r\nYep,
    here it is: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/35305_4737.gif]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

  body: "If nothing else, you will have to correct kerning.\r\n\r\nBTW: Since it's
    a mark for a town, did you think to use some kind of heraldry in it? Not in a
    regular old fashioned way but an open modern way? It will definitely put it apart
    from corporate identity.\r\n\r\nI'd also make a different stylisation of the goose...\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert
