body: Ok, lets say I want to produce a huge grid of squares all at say 1&#34;, and
  a gap between each of say .1&#34; -- whats the best way to go about this, so I can
  have it percise. I really dont want to have to duplicate these all by hand, not
  to mention I need them to be percise. <BR> <BR>Ideas?

    <BR>Enter 1.1in in the Horizontal field &#40;0 in other fields&#41; <BR>Press
    Copy <BR>Press Cmd&#43;D&#40;Ctrl&#43;D&#41; for as many as you need horizontally
    <BR>Now select all your boxes <BR>Cmd&#43;Shift&#43;M &#40;Ctrl&#43;Shift&#43;M&#41;
    again <BR>Enter 1.1in in the vertical field &#40;0 in other fields&#41; &#40;copies
    upward -1.1in would copy downward&#41; <BR>Press Copy <BR>Press Cmd&#43;D&#40;Ctrl&#43;D&#41;
    for as many as you need vertically <BR> <BR>Hope this helps. <BR> <BR>I suppose
    you could make a pattern tile and tile the area but I hardly ever do this so I
    can&#39;t remember how. <BR> <BR>Jon'
