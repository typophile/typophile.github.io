		<div class="commentbody">chris, you can always try to run it through <!-- raw HTML omitted -->babelfish<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it will turn out somewhat intelligible. although it does give the letter names funny translations (letter 4). I tried that last night and with a bit of decoding it makes sense, mostly. Also, I posted a link to the bottom of the thread that hrant referenced above and that one has some good illustrations that don't even need translating, for example i thought this was fairly straightforward: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->if you really want a translation, i can do my best, but it may take a while to get it back to you&hellip; lemme know.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It also depends very much on where you are. In Europe, it seems to be pretty widely legal that you can photocopy an entire book if it is for your own use. In Canada, photocopying even one page for pretty much any purpose seems to be illegal, althought I suspect that this might have relaxed a little in recent years. Shortly after I was at university here, big signs went up around the photocopy machines in the library warning students that they should not copy any material that was still in copyright.</div>

Probably has to do with prestige, and the fact that finding authors is usually easy anyway.

		<div class="commentbody">Hm. Maybe checking out the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Copyright Licencing Agency's page for UK HE Institutions <!-- raw HTML omitted --> would be better than pronouncing on the hierarchy of ethics over law and the like (first return on Google for &quot;copyright licensing UK&quot;, not too difficult).  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Where we read that within a HEI you can photocopy 5% or an article or a chapter of a publication for study, or to distribute as part of a study pack, e.g. in the case of diatance learners. At the same time, it expressly forbids scanning in. Pretty simple; and could please any pedants inclined to observe that modern photocopiers are in effect scanners reflect on the distinction between a single copy whose destination is known, and unlimited, uncontrolled copies.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the way of a postscript I will add that when Typo Papers started going out of print we did look into other distribution models. However, the earlier issues in particular were produced on a traditional workflow (paste-ups, film, etc.); to resurrect a print job from a legacy pre-press environment and generate PDFs is, as they say in some areas, non-trivial. So, don't hold your breath.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, thank you for the kind words, but I should clarify that I was not in any way involved with bringing TypoPapers out.

		<div class="commentbody">Of course I do, Hrant, but remind me why is this relevant? Chris asked for help, and my name was mentioned as someone who could; I clarified whether I can, and in what manner. You could do the same, as long as you keep in mind that the moment you bought a copy of any publication you essentially agree to respect the author's and publisher's copyright as determined by whichever legislation applies. Any decisions in the realm of ethics come over and above legal obligations, to further protect the rights holder, rather than open up distribution to third parties. So, even if the law allowed you to photocopy and distribute a TypoPapers article without clearance, the ethical stance would be to seek permission from the originator. But you could never claim an ethical ground for ignoring rights in the name of &quot;freedom of information&quot; or something similarly vacuous. (To be more precise: you could argue that there is a case for reviewing proprietary and patented/registered information in cases where substantial public interest is at stake, as in the case of pharmaceutical companies holding rights to vaccines &ndash; but this is an exceptionally complicated point unlikely to be settled by us chatting away here.)</div>
