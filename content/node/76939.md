body: "Hello everybody. I have been working on completing the Character Set for my
  Expletus Sans, which can be viewed here: http://www.typophile.com/node/76721\r\nI
  used to work in the Mac OS Roman codepage, which worked fine. I switched to the
  MS Windows 1252 Western (ANSI) codepage reasontly and now the Metrics window doesn't
  link what I type with the right glyph. As you can see in the pict, the glyphs in
  the codepage are all where they're supposed to be. What am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/expletus-sans-perthous_3553.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nJasper de Waard"

    right name, but that does not necessarily mean it is correctly encoded. What Unicode
    value does it have?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: The problem occurd in Typetool. After opening in Fontlab and saving, the problem
    was solved. I guess Typetool was just a little bit confused.

  body: IIRC, this problem occurs in TypeTool in Codepages mode; if you switch to
    Names, it works fine...or maybe it's the other way around...

  body: "The ANSI character entered in the Metrics Windows' text box sometimes map
    to a wrong character. It's a bug in FontLab Studio, but it only affects the preview
    inside the application, not the generated fonts. \r\n"
