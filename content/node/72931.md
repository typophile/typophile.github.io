  body: Your blown-up jaggy image isn't helping much, but it's probably Futura Condensed...

  body: Not Futura with that R, S, and that K. I'm thinking a version of Franklin
    Gothic condensed or compressed. The M makes no sense. How was this generated?
    are these loose/cutout letters? In which case the M could be an upside down W.

  body: "This isn't the most helpful sample - it would have been better served at
    its original size. However, I can tell this much: it's almost certainly based
    on Trade Gothic or Alternate Gothic (based on the R and S), and the M is most
    likely an inverted W. It would appear to be a unique font, however, given that
    the Fs and Ss are the same size and position relative to the baseline. Looking
    at the darker pixels leads me to think that it's a grungy treatment of either
    of these fonts, but DaFont, AbstractFonts and MyFonts reveal nothing - although
    there are plenty of alternatives that would achieve the same effect.\r\n\r\n-NJ"
