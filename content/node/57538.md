  is a script with tall sweeping ascenders packed with alternates and ligatures.\r\n\r\nOlidia
  Pro includes over 40 alternate characters and 20 ligatures. This allows designers
  to mix and match characters to create luxurious and graceful custom logotypes and
  headlines in OpenType capable applications such as Adobe\u201As CS suite or QuarkXpress.\r\n\r\nThese
  alternates are also available in limited preset fonts that are available separately.
  Olidia Alternate One is highly ornamental, with plenty of sweeping ascenders and
  descenders, while Olidia Alternate Two is much more restrained and can be used for
  body copy. The Third strikes a balance between the two sets.\r\n\r\nOlidia Pro OpenType
  features include ending swashes, ornaments, ligatures, discretionary ligatures,
  titling alternates, contextual alternates, style sets and stylistic alternates.
  See the sample .pdf as a reference to quickly access desired alternate sets.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Biscuit-Boodle-Poster_5790.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/biscuit-boodle-ornaments/|Biscuit
