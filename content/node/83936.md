  OS, none of our products except Fontographer will work. This is not something I'd
  like to say, but it is how it goes.\r\n\r\nYour options are:\r\n\r\n1. Do not upgrade
  your OS. \r\n2. [[http://bit.ly/fontlabbetaaplication|Join FLS beta.]] I don't know
  if subscription is available at this moment, but it is worth trying. \r\n3. [[http://www.fontlab.com/front-page/welcome/mac-os-x-10-7-lion-compatibility.html|Read
  this document]] and get the Lion Compatibility Pack for any of our products. \r\n\r\nYou
  can get much more info in this document: [[http://www.fontlab.com/front-page/welcome/mac-os-x-10-7-lion-compatibility.html]]

  body: Well, Fog works with Lion just fine, is simple, stable and fast. FLS 5.1 is
    fine too, but we've missed a deadline for a week or two.
