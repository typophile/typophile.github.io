  the effects and risks to women in particular are unique. <a href=\"http://www.soberlivingoutpatient.com\"><strong>Outpatient
  drug rehab</strong></a> has observed that women appear to be much more susceptible
  to the harmful effects of alcohol and drug dependence than men, even though men,
  as a whole, are more inclined to abuse drugs and alcohol and develop alcoholism
  and drug dependence. Thus, this article seeks to briefly address the impact of drug
  addiction and alcoholism as it relates specifically to females and observations
  recognized by outpatient drug rehab.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFemales are more likely
  to have negative consequences and develop drug and alcohol related diseases much
  quicker than males. Additionally, studies demonstrate that females require less
  ingestion's of a substance prior to developing the negative health effects. Moreover,
  studies show and outpatient drug rehab statistics show that women are more likely
  to self-medicate by abusing alcohol and drugs when they are suffering from depression,
  stress, anxiety or emotional problems.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nStudies have demonstrated and
  outpatient drug rehab has observed that females who drink more than 7 alcoholic
  drinks in a seven-day period are at much higher and increased risk of being involved
  in fatal car accidents, high blood pressure, cancer, stroke and self-inflicted injury
  or suicide. Additionally, females who drink more than 7 alcoholic drinks in a seven-day
  period have an increased rate of drug and alcohol dependence.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>The
  Common Health Problems Suffered by Women who develop Drug and Alcohol Dependence
  </strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\nAbuse of drugs and alcohol by females makes them more susceptible
  than men to the following:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<strong>Liver dysfunction.</strong>
  Females who develop alcohol or drug dependence are more susceptible than men to
  developing liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<strong>Brain
  damage.</strong>Conditions such as reduced brain size and alcohol and drug induced
  brain disease and dysfunction are much more common in females than men who are drug
  and alcohol dependent.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\nA comparison of women who suffer
  from drug and alcohol dependence and those who are in outpatient drug rehab, compared
  to those who drink in moderation or not at all indicates that those suffering from
  dependence are at an increased risk of Osteoporosis, frequent injuries from falling,
  increased risk of hip fractures, increased risk of infertility, increased risk of
  miscarriage, early onset of menopause and increased risk of high blood pressure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Increased
  Alcohol usage increases the Risk of Breast Cancer</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs a female
  increase alcohol intake, her risk of developing breast cancer increases. The studies
  demonstrate that as a female increases her intake of alcohol by 10 gram increments
  per day, the relative risk of developing breast cancer increases 10% over the lifetime
  of the woman. If a female abstains from all alcohol intakes over her lifetime, the
  risk of developing breast cancer is roughly 9%. However, if a female ingest two
  drinks per day her risk of developing breast cancer increases to 10%. Moreover,
  if a female ingests six drinks per day her risk of developing breast cancer increases
  to 13%<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\nPrevalence of Women and Girls Drinking</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAccording
  to a 2009 survey, approximately 47% of women ages 12 and over in the United States
  reported being current drinkers, defined as having had a drink in the past 30 days.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTrends
  suggest and outpatient drug rehab has observed that white, employed women are drinking
  greater amounts of alcohol and with greater frequency. Some of this increase may
  reflect a greater comfort on the part of women to discuss their drinking.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Female
  Drinking is becoming more socially acceptable</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\nOver history,
  it has been socially unacceptable for women to abuse drugs and alcohol. Society
  has placed much more shame on women as compared to men who drink to excess. However,
  it appears that among the younger female population, this stigma is beginning to
  fade and become more acceptable in society.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAccording to data
  from a survey of almost 18,000 college students across the U.S., about one in three
  female students engage in binge drinking (consuming four or more drinks in a row,
  often in quick succession).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAdditionally, as it applies to females:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\nThe
  rate of binge drinking in all-female colleges more than doubled between 1993 and
  2001.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\nWhile more college men are dependent on alcohol, women constitute
  more than half of alcohol abusers among college students.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Risky
  Drinking is easy to accomplish without noticing</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Standard
  drink quantities are as follows:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tBeer of Wine
  in a 12 ounce glass or plastic bottle</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tA glass of wine measuring
  5 ounces</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t1.5 ounces of alcohol or distilled 80 proof liquor</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStudies
  have defined moderate drinking to include less than seven drinks in a seven-day
  period and less than three drinks on any particular day. Factors such as height,
  weight, genetic composition, family history and age are all factors that women must
  consider when determining the amount of alcohol that she can safely ingest. Note,
  it is easy, especially for females to cross the stated levels above.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAll
  of the research indicates that any alcohol ingestion by females during pregnancy
  is unsafe.&nbsp; Additionally some scientists agree that the risk of injury far
  outweighs the benefits of any ingestion of alcohol by females.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause
  women become addicted to alcohol more easily than men, drinking even moderately
  can be a slippery slope. This is especially true for older women. In fact, about
  half of all cases of alcoholism in women begin after age 59.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCertainly,
  no one should feel obliged to start drinking for the health benefits. There are
  plenty of other ways to safeguard your health, such as regular exercise, a nutritious
  diet, keeping your weight under control, and not smoking. But for women who enjoy
  alcoholic beverages, it\u2019s important to know where to draw the line, and to
  be prepared to redraw it as you get older</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Why are women
  more sensitive to the effects of alcohol?</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeveral biological
  factors that have been observed in outpatient drug rehab make women more vulnerable
  to the effects of alcohol than men.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<strong>Body fat.</strong>
  Women tend to weigh less than men, and\u2014pound for pound\u2014a woman\u2019s
  body contains less water and more fatty tissue than a man\u2019s. Because fat retains
  alcohol while water dilutes it, alcohol remains at higher concentrations for longer
  periods of time in a woman\u2019s body, exposing her brain and other organs to more
  alcohol.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<strong>Enzymes.</strong> Women have lower levels
  of two enzymes\u2014alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase\u2014that metabolize
  (break down) alcohol in the stomach and liver. As a result, women absorb more alcohol
  into their bloodstreams than men.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<strong>Hormones. </strong>Changes
  in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle may also affect how a woman metabolizes
  alcohol.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese biological factors explain why women become
  intoxicated after drinking less and are more likely to suffer adverse consequences
  after drinking smaller quantities and for fewer years than men.</p>\r\n"
