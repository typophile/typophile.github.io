body: The Baseball playoffs are down to 4 teams New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox,
  Chicago Cubs and Florida Marlins. I mention this for our foreign friends so they
  can check out the logos and type at there home sites. My question is based on typography
  and letter design who should win.

    because they are a real baseball team not just some arse&#39;s boy toys.  <BR>

  body: Randy Wrigley has lights I remember seeing the first game on TV Cubs vs Mets.
    They started there game last night at 8pm EST. Florida should loose to the Cubs
    because the Cubs logo is so much better and the Ivy covered walls of Wrigley.

  body: 'Uh yeah, I know. 1988 vs. the Mets &#40;cubs win 6-4&#41;. Last park to install
    lights, 40 years after the runners up at Tiger Stadium in detroit. Constructed
    in 1914. Smallest stadium in the national league. Site of Babe Ruth&#39;s famous
    called shot. And in my opinion, the best house in baseball, just barely edging
    out Fenway Park. <BR> <BR>The ivy and logo prevailed!  '

  body: Lets see if its pinstripes or red sox that prevail this evening. The Yankee
    NY looks like a photostat that was shot to many times its very soft. I wonder
    if it was really drawn that way or has changed over the years. Dan
