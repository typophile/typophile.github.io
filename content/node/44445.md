  magazine about monograms and would love any thoughts you have on the what makes
  a good one, how and where they should be used, your opinions as to the best ones
  out there, and of course your own.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nWill"

  body: "There are two books published by Dover (though I don't know if they are still
    in print) that show lots of examples:\r\n\r\nMonograms and Ciphers, designed and
    drawn by A.A. Turbayne. 1200 designs. Originally published in 1906.\r\n\r\nMonograms
    and Alphabetic Devices, by Hayward and Blanch Cirker. 2500 illustrations. Contains
    the unabridged contents of four books published in the nineteenth century. \r\n\r\nThe
    second one especially has some incredible stuff in it."
