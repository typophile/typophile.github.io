body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been through a few other websites which provide suggestions
  based on the image, and I went through the questionnaire on Identifont which suggested
  Chickens and Arista 2.0 - both of these are similar but slightly different to the
  one I'm after. \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sparkytype/chickens/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/zetafonts/arista-2-0/gallery.html\r\n\r\nThe
  logo I'm looking at is for an Australian company called \"Eye Dream Pty Ltd\". They're
  quite small so don't have their own website as far as I can tell, but the logo is
  at the bottom left of this website: http://coloronpro.com.au/ and is also attached.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone can help me identify this font I'd really appreciate it. \r\n\r\nThanks,
  \r\n\r\nAshleigh.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eye dream logo white_5816.png]"

    Universal.\r\n\r\n\"eye dream\" appears to be the same, with the the stroke endings
    graphically rounded. (and pretty badly, if you ask me, looking at the 'd' and
    'a'.\r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n\r\n\r\n"
