body: Yes. I am very sad about this. Although, it isn&#39;t necessarily a done deal.
  The client might still license Stainless. But, because of Font Bureau&#39;s restrictive
  EULA in regards to PDF distribution I am looking for alternatives to Stainless Regular
  and Stainless Black for my client. They distribute a monthly newsletter through  PDF
  and print. I have also used Amplitude and could see ... oh this is wrong, I realize
  that. I love these typefaces but don&#39;t wish to steer my clients into something
  more than they can afford. Anyway, suggestions welcome. I will also let you guys
  know what Font Bureau says once I talk to them. Bless them they have some beautiful
  type but I fear I need to use other type for this one.

    sans isn&#39;t bad, but the rounded corners might suggest something like weakness
    and lack of decisiveness and as this is a political newsletter for a group of
    extreme liberals I&#39;m not sure that is the look they want. <BR> <BR>Hrant,
    the problem is that we&#39;ve already put in place a basic look that they do like.
    I&#39;m not so unrealistic that I want something as close to the same as possible,
    but I also need generally the same feel. <BR> <BR>As for the way Font Bureau does
    business. It is their choice and I&#39;m looking for something else because I
    want to educate my clients about licensing and am using this as an opportunity.

    Amplitude or Stainless. <BR> <BR>Ginger is close too, but the lowercase k is a

    Sadly it is just too narrow. Same problem for this job with Stalemate. &#40;Thanks,

    Probably a great suggestion. Hmm.  I&#39;ll have to have a conversation with the

  body: First thanks to all for your help. Especially to Stephen for the personal
    attention and time spent. However ... I thought I&#39;d share with all of you
    the results of this search.  <BR> <BR>To license the four typefaces I need from
    The Font Bureau--Stainless Regular, Stainless Regular Compressed, Stainless Black,
    and Stainless Black Compressed--for a 2-5 CPU license it will be $280.00 with
    an addition of only 10% for my current needs for distributing PDFs of the newsletter.
    That 10% isn&#39;t a yearly fee either so for an item that is being sold every
    month it is, I think, worth to the client to license these typefaces from The
    Font Bureau and not sweat trying to find a replacement. <BR> <BR>Also, to clarify
    a few things. Their EULA does allow for embedding for output as well it allows
    for embedding to proof to clients. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d say the moral of this story
    is to call the foundry first.

  body: John, for my agreement it is up to 10,000 PDFs for distribution. It would
    be 5% for the license agreement for 1000 PDFs for distribution. So basically for
    $28.00 more dollars my client is covered.

  body: I&#39;m not going to name names--because I deeply appreciate and respect the
    foundry and their typefaces--but this was a quote for embedding of another font
    family from a different foundry. Before I received this quote I had already realized
    that Font Bureau&#39;s fee was reasonable, but now I am convinced of it. <BR>
    <BR>I am sorry for the delay. Thank you for your interest in ________. A 2 CPU
    license, at one location, for _________ 1 and 2 would be $358. In addition to
    the license you would have to pay an annual embedding fee of $300 to be able to
    embed ________ and _____________. To embed all 16 styles of  <BR>_______ 1 and
    2 would be $2,400 per year.  <BR> <BR>Yikes! For me and my humble client this
    was a lot. If I were, say, Giganticorp &#40;to borrow terminology used by Kristin
    Dooley&#41; it might be more worthwhile.

    if I were Font Bureau I&#39;d either increase or eliminate their embedding fees.
    Right now the need for extra licensing is an irritant to the customer, and the

  body: Shhhhhhhhhhhh! Thomas! Harry might be listening! :^D <BR> <BR>I think the
    $$$ adds up for larger orders in regards to what Font Bureau charges. I was only
    licensing 4 typefaces for 2-5 CPUs. If my client had been a larger corporation
    it would&#39;ve meant a little more. I don&#39;t think FB wants to scare off the
    customers, but I also think that to embed for distributable PDFs is a value add
    according to FB&#39;s EULA and so a small fee is reasonable. <BR> <BR>While I
    do appreciate, very much, the foundries who do not charge extra for embedding
    for distribution I also realize that it is a business and everyone has their own
    opinion on what their fonts are worth. FB has never raised the prices of their
    fonts and I appreciate that.
