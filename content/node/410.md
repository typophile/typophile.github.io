  body: Sarah. Others will hopefully respond, but in my opinion I don&#39;t think
    it necessarily ends with a degree. It might begin with a solid portfolio, but
    I think it also includes an internship at a foundry. Have you attempted to contact
    any type design studios in your area? Font Bureau is in Boston. They might use
    interns. I also know that at one time The Hoefler Foundry used interns, they are
    in New York City.  <BR> <BR>At an internship level they probably aren&#39;t looking
    at your lettering or type skills so much as your sincere desire to learn, and
    also your design portfolio. You might not get to design any type while on your
    internship, but you can see the inner-workings of a studio. Which in and of itself
    could be very useful. It would give you a good jumping off point as well.

  body: Sorry, it&#39;s late and I just got back from a wedding. <BR> <BR>Internships,
    or even entry-level design positions, at most design studios will depend slightly
    on your degree and examples in your portfolio but mostly on how you present yourself,
    as Tiffany says &#40;kind of&#41;.  <BR> <BR>...although, the few times that I&#39;ve
    been sent out to Senior shows to hire people, I was asked by the higher-ups to
    find people who did work that was exactly the kind of stuff we needed. <BR> <BR>That
    company went under. Go figure.

  body: Sarah -- <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re serious about type design as a career, with
    a <i>bona fide</i> foundry and all -- as opposed to just hanging out with the
    rest of us posers here ;-&#41; -- then I would echo what Tiffany said.  <BR> <BR>An
    internship would be a good way to get your foot in the door and some reputable
    experience under your belt. While you&#39;re still fresh out of college and able
    to move around and live off relatively little, that&#39;s the best time to take
    advantage of this sort of thing. Font Bureau does take interns; I think they usually
    recruit out of the classes at Yale or RISD, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not a
    prerequisite. If you&#39;re serious, call them up and ask Harry if they have any
    openings and what they look for. <BR> <BR>Jonathan Hoefler has been known to take
    interns -- just ask Jared. I think Bitstream might also, but that&#39;s just a
    guess. Then there&#39;s always P22; I think Richard Kegler welcomes interns occasionally,
    and he&#39;s a little closer to you, I think. <BR> <BR>If you can get yourself
    over to <a href="http://www.typecon2003.com" target="_blank"> TypeCon</a> in Minneapolis
    next month, you can meet a lot of folks who do the type thing in all different
    ways and maybe get a better idea of what kind of approach might work best for
    you. I highly recommend it -- the registration fee can&#39;t be beat and a good
    time is always had by all. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR> <BR>

  body: Ashwiny -- <BR> <BR>Perhaps you can seek out R. K. Joshi. He has taught at
    IDC/IIT there in Mumbai. I don&#39;t know if he is still there. His Raghu font
    of Devanagari was a winner in the ATypI Bukva:raz! competition last year. Mr.
    Joshi may be able to offer advice for you there in India. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    dialect&#41;under his guidence, that was all. unfortunately we can no longer work
    under his guidence. he is extremely busy.;-&#40; may be you can still help me.

  body: Ashwiny, I guess be happy for the internet, and Typophile! :-/ But of course
    there&#39;s no substitute for human contact. <BR> <BR>I think next year&#39;s
    ATypI conference will be in Prague, which is relatively close to you. Prague is
    not an expensive city to visit, but the conference is pretty expensive... unless
    you&#39;re a student. <BR> <BR>You can also look at the conferences of the Icograda
    organization. It&#39;s not directly related to type, but they tour all over the
    world, and have regional events too. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
