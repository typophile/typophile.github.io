  body: Yeah, they&#39;re so small I can&#39;t really tell. But what attracted me
    to this was that it rendered fairly well onscreen at that small size, which I
    need. I could always use a bitmap screen font, which would obviously be even more
    legible onscreen, but I&#39;d like to use the same face for the headers and menus,
    etc. <BR> <BR>It does look like Interstate Condensed, so thanks for the help on
    that one.

  body: Although I&#39;d still be interested to know what the small type is, I&#39;ve
    decided to use Frutiger 87 Extra Black Condensed as a &#34;close enough&#34; match
    &#40;especially at this size&#41;. The t is different, but it a close match on
    a font that I already own. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help <BR>Tim
