		<div class="commentbody">But don't let the process become the point! And it shouldn't be so linear. In practice it's very iterative: you make some glyphs, you see how they behave in <i>groups</i> (where spacing already comes in), you can even allow the [eventual] kerning to affect the letterforms! Even hinting can have such a &quot;backwards&quot; effect - just look at the Bolds in the MS core fonts - they wouldn't have been so bold without the necessity to eventually not have to hint every single stem, etc. <BR> <BR>Practically speaking, the greatest amount of iteration will be between the letterforms and the sidebearings: because the <i>relationship between the Black and the White</i> is what matters most, the &quot;internal&quot; counters of glyphs are tied to the &quot;external&quot; sidebearings. So you make some key glyphs (different for each designer, but also dependent on the intended use of the font - for example a display face will rely more on the memorability of individual glyphs, while a text face will rely more on the integration of the whole), then see how they fit together, modify them, add some more glyphs, try those in combo, modify, etc. Yeah, it's a pain.  :-) <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Hrant that it's very iterative. <BR> <BR>That being said, the most important thing is to try to finalize the spacing before getting into kerning. If you mess with the spacing much after you get into kerning, you will likely need to throw out all your kerning and start over again. <BR> <BR>If you're working in PostScript style outlines, there's no reason not to hint your glyphs as you're working on them. If you're working with TrueType outlines, you pretty much have to leave hinting to absolute dead last. <BR> <BR>Other than that, it's a matter of taste and preference. <BR> <BR>Personally, working with PS outlines, I complete a handful of glyphs, and while I'm working on them I space and hint them. I then test them together and fix the spacing some more. Then I continue to expand the glyph complement (hinting all the while), periodically stopping and refining the spacing. <BR> <BR>The typeface I'm working on right now I have tweaked the spacing too much, so I will be tossing out the moderate amount of kerning I already did and starting over. I didn't invest a lot of time in the kerning because I knew I wasn't 100% done with the spacing. <BR> <BR>Hope that's of some help. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

If you can safely assume that kerning will be available virtually all the time*, you can make different (more efficient) spacing decisions, and sometimes even different letterform decisions (like in the beak of the &quot;r&quot; or the size of the serifs on the &quot;v&quot;). <BR> <BR>* And when it fails because of amateurism on the user's end, such users won't notice anyway! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I do agree, if this is what you are getting at, that some scripts require extensive kerning to achieve acceptable basic spacing, i.e. that kerning is not always 'exceptions' to basic spacing as it usually is in Latin fonts. In that case, application of kerning should be part of the language shaping engine, not something turned on by the user.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It comes down to the near-requirement of avoiding touching: you want the words to set tightly, but scripts that have letters with a lot of lateral &quot;protrusions&quot; will collide a lot (with kerning off). You can either set everything loose and use a ton of negative pairs to correct, or you can set everything with &quot;natural&quot; tightness and use some positive pairs to remove collisions. Which way you go depends on a number of things, like the degree of collision in the script, the intended user base of the font, but also the amount of time/effort you want/can_afford_to put into the design.  And this last consideration isn't limited to lazy/cheap people like me. :-) The MS core fonts have too-dark Bolds basically because it would have been ridiculous* to hint every single stem to snap wider to two pixels. <BR> <BR>* Both in effort and resultant file size - note that about 50% of the file of an MS core font is the hinting!! <BR> <BR>Let me give a real example: Armenian has a fair amount of &quot;collision potential&quot; (mostly in the descenders). You can tame the protrusions, but that's culturally and functionally (think boumas) bad - although you still do it a little bit (in the same way that a &quot;g&quot; in a [good] Latin text face needs to look slightly cramped). To save myself having to set everything loose and then tighten with a ton of pairs, I went the other way. With 546 pairs* I got really good texture. My estimate of how many pairs would have been required with the other (non-kern-reliant) method is 3-4000, so a lot more work. With kerning off, this kern-reliant method will produce some collisions when set without kerning, but: it will also produce better &quot;x-band&quot; spacing; people with kerning off aren't likely to mind some touching anyway. <BR> <BR>* Tellingly (although not surprisingly) about half of the pairs were positive - very unlike the typical Latin font. BTW, Mana uses some reliance on positive pairs too - this allows it to be tight (unlike Verdana for example). Over 1/3-rd of Mana's pairs are positive. <BR> <BR>&gt; application of kerning should be part of the language <BR>&gt; shaping engine, not something turned on by the user. <BR> <BR>But in practice the user -and the app- end up sharing the responsability. Most notably, MS Word does support kerning, but the user has to turn it on (and every time) - never gonna happen.  :-( <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

You're presenting incorrect speculation as fact (again). Given a well-hinted TrueType font in the first place, it is literally a single line of code that accomplishes this. <BR> <BR>In any superhinted TT font, one is controlling when the stems change from one thickness to the next, at least for most of the lower levels (one, two, three pixels thick). This is especially necessary when there's a matching italic, since one needs to make sure they break at the same ppem sizes for those lower levels. <BR> <BR>In other words, the &quot;additonal&quot; work involved and font size added, rounded to the nearest whole number as a percentage, is zero. (Though of course if one had already done the detailed hinting and then changed the stem widths, that would entail more work. But like spacing vs. kerning, that's not the order one does these tasks in.) <BR> <BR>If I were to speculate, I'd *guess* that the reason the bolds are so heavy for those fonts is to keep them more WYSIWYG between what they look like at typical screen sizes and what they look like in print. But that would be just speculation, though with a little more basis. <BR> <BR>This is somehow comforting. I think I had agreed with the last half dozen posts of Hrant's that I had read. I was wondering if it was a sign of the apocalypse or something.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>That aside, I do understand and agree with Hrant's comments about different scripts needing a different spacing vs. kerning strategy. I believe my original comments apply reasonably well to Latin, Greek and Cyrillic. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

There's so little WYSIWYG between <i>different sizes of the Geogia bitmaps</i> (which is actually good news though), much less between the bitmaps and print - so WYSIWYG of <i>the color relationship between screen and print</i> seems pretty far-fetched.

		<div class="commentbody">That has more to do with issues around shapes where changing the shape requires delta hints, which do add (substantially) to file size.

		<div class="commentbody">Adam, naughty boy - thou shalt not modify MS fonts!  ;-) <BR> <BR>&gt; That approach likely explains why the bolds are so bold <BR> <BR>I still can't see that. The fact that the onscreen stem difference between the Regular and Bold has to be 100% (below 17 PPEM) only translates to the outlines needing to have the same relationship <i>if</i> hinting effort is an issue. <BR> <BR>&gt; Which has the effect of making the screen <BR>&gt; font more WYSIWYG relative to the outline font. <BR> <BR>Only below 17 PPEM. Above that it's only 50% (upto ~25). And consider that the higher the PPEM the more WYSIWYG a screen font becomes&hellip; So what were they really shooting for? <BR> <BR>BTW, in this old interview <BR><a href="http://www.will-harris.com/verdana-georgia.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.will-harris.com/verdana-georgia.htm">http://www.will-harris.com/verdana-georgia.htm</a></a> <BR>Carter says &quot;The bitmaps dictated the weight.&quot; <BR>Could he really have meant they &quot;dictated&quot; via WYSIWYG? Or isn't it probable it was via <i>hinting</i>? <BR> <BR>Returning to the &quot;easy&quot; bit: exactly what becomes <i>easier</i> by making the Bold too dark? WYSIWYG becomes easier?! That doesn't seem to make sense. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">A follow-up question: <BR>I can believe that making a Bold's outlines snap [wider] to two pixels is simply a matter of setting a threshold  (as opposed to tediously hinting every glyph), but: if this applies only to stems (and not arches for example) is it possible that this would create an imbalance in a glyph's rendering, like in fact sometimes introducing stroke contrast? Especially in a monoweight* font like Verdana. <BR> <BR>* As a side question: is that a good term, or is &quot;monoline&quot; better? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant,  <BR> <BR>in hinting terms, &quot;stems&quot; are both horizontal and vertical &quot;corridors&quot; of node alignment. You can control the thresholds when PPMs switch to 2, 3, 4 etc. pixels for both horizontal and vertical stems, separately. So you can control the stroke contrast, and keep it linear. As for arches, you cannot hint them explicitly &ndash; all Type 1 hints and most TrueType instructions work in either horizontal or vertical direction only (there is some diagonal control in TTH).  <BR> <BR>You say &quot;setting a threshold (as opposed to tediously hinting every glyph)&quot;. Stem control does not occur OPPOSED to hinting, it IS hinting. In fact, it is the fundament of any hinting &ndash; you always start with the font-wide parameters (that go into the control value table &quot;cvt&quot; and the font preprogram &quot;prep&quot;).  <BR> <BR>Only after you've reasonably set the font-wide hinting parameters such as stems and alignment zones, you start with per-glyph hinting, since instructing individual glyphs is basically fixing and fine-tuning what the font-wide hinting has achieved.  <BR> <BR>Adam <BR></div>
