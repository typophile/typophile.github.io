    The G doesn't close the same, but the effect is similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "An even closer font is [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/kit_condensed_italic/?sample_text=Gatorade|Kit
    Condensed Italic]]. I think 'close' is probably the most to expect, as I think
    the logo is custom, as most logos are.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
