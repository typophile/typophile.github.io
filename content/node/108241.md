  Book Light headers (which cannot be changed). Any ideas? Thanks!

  body: As far as I'm aware there is no such thing as 'Giovanni Book Light' ? but,
    be that as it may, I would look towards Calluna or Eureka Sans if for no other
    reason than the venetian angled crossbar on the 'e'

  body: Thanks, that's what the designer said he used (Giovanni Book Light), so he
    may be wrong on the finer details. I am an in-house designer set with the task
    of developing the rest of the ID templates. I will check out Calluna and Eureka.
    I like the idea of matching the "e", and will also try to find sans fonts that
    use the older style "g" and "a" as used by Giovanni.
