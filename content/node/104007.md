  body: "Doesn't look like a font to me, more a custom job (and a bad one). It may
    have started with a contrasted flare serif, removing some serifs and rebuilding
    some letters (/G?)\r\nSame vein, better design to me: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/goldenbook|Goldenbook]],

  body: "A font that is the victim of this serif clipping treatment is sometimes called
    demi-serif. It was a fad a few years ago -- some stores even redid their logos
    -- but the attraction of the procedure seems to have waned. For fonts that look
    like this try searches for demi-serif and semi-serif. Might even find one that
    matches. \r\nDon"
