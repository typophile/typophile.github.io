body: "In the type classif. system published by [[Robert Bringhurst|Bringhurst]] in
  <em>[[elements_of_typographic_style|Elements]]</em> and his article in Serif #1,
  \"[[Grotesque]]\" faces like [[Helvetica]], [[Univers]] and [[Akzidenz Grotesque|Akzidenz]]
  fall under \"Realist Roman\". It seems one of the characteristics of Realists is
  small aperture (don't know if that's the correct english term, sorry), but faces
  such [[Frutiger]] have a very large aperture, and while they are [[monoline]] [[sans
  serif|sans]] I feel they are different design concept than \"grotesques\". \r\n<!--break-->\r\nI'd
  like to know how other people feel about this. Are Helvetica and Frutiger to be
  in the same \"package\" (as has been in other type classification systems) or does
  the latter need another \"compartment\", along with other similarly open/legible/signage-oriented
  sans?"

  body: "Stanley Hess, in his form-based classification system (The Modification of
    Letterforms, 1971), describes faces such as Frutiger as having \"unfolded\" curves
    -- this is the opposite of having a small aperture, and is defined in relation
    to stroke shape, not the counter or negative space.\r\n\r\nBy his terminology,
    Futura and Gill Sans are in the same \"unfolded\" category as Frutiger.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yet, the unfoldedness in Frutiger seems more to do with having a compact letter
    form, and this design rationale continues in the Meta genre of semi-condensed,
    4-letter name, sans serifs.\r\n\r\nSo I think that we/Robert Bringhurst need a
    new \"crossover\" term to describe this contemporary type genre. \r\n\r\nAs Bringhurst's
    method is to ally type genres with dominant art-historical movements of the type's
    era, \"Post-modernist\" would seem to be the obvious choice. The main problem
    with that is we tend to think of grunge and deconstructed typefaces as being the
    quintessentially Post-modern forms.\r\n\r\nWill the true PoMo please step forward?!\r\n\r\n"

  body: In Germany, Frutiger is referred to as a "humanist" sans serif. Gill Sans
    probably falls into that category, too, but Futura would be a geometric sans.
    And Helvetica, Akzidenz and co. are "Grotesks" (i.e., "realist" the sans serifs
    that Bringhurt writes about).

    postmodernism because of the \"found\" aesthetic? \r\n\r\nis that the concensus
    regarding these types of (grunge)faces? because in the \r\nE. of T.S., Bringhurst's
    example of a postmodern face looks more like the type of letter that exists in
    the AIGA mark, or in HTF's Mercury. how do you suppose Bringhurst would categorize
    \"grunge\" ?\r\n\r\ni agree that \"postmodern\" is becoming a little too nebulous
    at this point\u2026\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nnc\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Neo-Humanism is, perfectly sensibly, classified in Bringhurst as a variety
    of Modernism. Frutiger reduces humanist models to a constructionism which is appealing
    and clear but not chirographic: it is humane rather than humanist.'

  body: "Nick, I hadn't checked EofTS for Bringhurst's idea of PostModern recently.\r\nSo
    yes, he's matching a contemporary type genre to the obvious main art-theory movement.\r\nNot
    a good fit for the faces he chooses, which just seem to be synthetically traditional.\r\n\r\nA
    more thorough theoretical understanding of Post-modernism is well established
    in typography, in relation to fonts like Dead History, Caustic Biomorph, and Carter's
    Walker typeface. So it would be hard to categorize types as prosaic as Frutiger
    as Postmodern."
