  so first things first: thanks!\r\n\r\nI recently finished a complete overhaul of
  my portfolio site (I'm a graphic designer and animator), and I wanted to get some
  opinions.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.brendanmarnell.com]]\r\n\r\nOne of the main questions
  I've been wrestling with is about the overall style. I've gotten some flak in the
  past because my site looks more \"childish\" or \"fun\" than \"professional,\" and
  \ I risk pigeon-holing myself as a one-trick designer. The flipside is that (imo)
  the site is unique, quirky, and shows some personality. Have any of you thought
  about this decision before? Which side did you come down on?\r\n\r\nBrendan\r\n"

  body: Hi Brendan, I took a quick look at your site. First off, what type of work
    do you enjoy doing, and are there particular fields that you enjoy working with
    more than others? If you are going for corporate work, then your site will probably
    not appeal to that group. If you are seeking work in the kids/youth market, then
    the design makes sense. Many design firms have a very neutral look for their identity.
    It lets the work speak for itself. Personally I like that approach best because
    I don't want to pigeonhole myself in a particular market. Hope that helps a bit.

  body: "Hi Chris, thanks for the response. It sounds like you think I am indeed pigeon-holing
    myself. I do enjoy doing work in the kids market - I worked at an animation studio
    doing children's programming for about a year and a half. But that's not the only
    type of work I enjoy doing. Maybe next time I do a redesign I will opt for something
    more neutral. Time will tell if having a site like this scares away a certain
    type of client.\r\n\r\nI don't know a lot of designers with 3D/animation skills,
    and I don't know a lot of 3D/animation people with design skills. I guess my goal
    was to create a site that showed I have that range."

    that other 1% ;o)\r\n\r\nNicely done!\r\n\r\n\"my site looks more \u201Cchildish\u201D
    or \u201Cfun\u201D than \u201Cprofessional,\u201D \"\r\n\r\nWho did you get that
    flack from? Boring suit-wearing middle managers at banks? Unless you REALLY want
    those folks as clients, I wouldn't worry about it. I've worked at both staid 'professional'
    looking firms and quirky 'this guy is winging it' type places. Both attracted
    plenty of 'professional' boring clients, but the quirky one also had a nice mix
    of oddball jobs. \r\n\r\nOnly nitpick is that once inside a portfolio, it'd be
    nice to have navigation for 'next' instead of having to click back each time to
    get to the next piece. I'd also add a bit of line spacing to your text blocks
    that describe each piece."

    parties let's not go into that. \r\n\r\nI think the next/previous buttons are
    a good idea. And I see what you mean about the text blocks - I can be stingy with
    the leading sometimes."
