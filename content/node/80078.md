body: "Hi Everybody, \r\n\r\nI'm a the main graphic designer working for a french
  magazine, and as we are changing our style guide I am now looking for nice fonts
  to use. Do you have any idea for serif and modern non-serif fonts for Headlines
  and current texts ?\r\n\r\nI'm a bit bored of using Freight, flama, din and lubalin
  which are pretty often used in magazines.\r\n\r\nI'd be really glad if you had some
  proposition to make =)\r\n\r\nThank you in advance."

  body: You give us very little upon which to base our recommendations. Tell us about
    the subject matter of the magazine, the editorial approach/attitude, the demographics
    of your readers, the goal(s) of the redesign, which typefaces you're currently
    using, etc.

  body: "thank you for your reactivity.\r\n\r\nIt's a skateboarding magazine... We
    merged with an other skateboarding mag to create a brand new one. I was using
    a lot : flama, din, lubalin which are pretty modern fonts and a bit of american
    typewriter for several headlines and freight big black. We want to create something
    smarter not to focus only on skateboarding but also on lifestyle, culture, art
    and music. Something very sober where the fonts will take a great part of the
    style guide. I was thinking about using serif fonts."
