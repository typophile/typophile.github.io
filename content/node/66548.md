  body: "Well, 'Angels' looks a lot like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/eurostile/t-black-extended/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D87%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DANGELS%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D38\">Eurostile
    Extended Black</a>, and 'Reggie Jackson' a lot like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica/condensed-black/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D87%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DREGGIE%2520JACKSON%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D39\">Helvetica
    Condensed Black</a>, but the sample is kind of small. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Stephen!\r\n\r\nAfter a night of searching, I thought the 'Angels'
    was <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/microgramma/\">Microgramma</a>
    and the 'Reggie Jackson' was <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/bureau+grotesque/fonts/\">Bureau
    Grotesque</a>. And after looking at your selections, Microgramma and Eurostyle
    look almost identical."

  body: "No, on further inspection you are definitely correct, it is Eurostile Extended
    Black and Helvetica Condensed Black.\r\n\r\nThank you Stephen!"

  body: Yes, Eurostile is an updated version of Microgramma, both designed by Aldo
    Novarese. Eurostile was a more complete version with lowercase characters added
    to the design, although it seems Microgramma has had a lowercase added since as
    well.
