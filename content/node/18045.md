  their transitions to and from events, their features of athletes, and their intros
  into commercials. It can be seen on this cover of their forthcoming DVD set:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nbcuniversalstore.com/popup.php?t=NBC+Universal+Store+-+2006+Olympic+Figure+Skating%2C+Vol.+1&u=%2Fimg%2Fproduct%2Fcatl%2F00007458-132893.jpg&h=400&w=400\r\n\r\nAt
  first I thought it was perhaps Neutraface, until I realized that Neutraface doesn't

  very much how an Italian Olympics should be. "
