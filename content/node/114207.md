body: "It seems far more common that usual seeing non-profit organizations using proprietary
  typefaces in their brand manuals, and i really struggle seeing volunteers buying
  these typefaces for contributing with graphic design materials (such as posters,
  flyers, magazines, videos, etc.) using them.\r\n\r\nWhat is the most correct thing
  to do instead? To do a whole rebranding, replacing all proprietary typefaces with
  ofl/apache/cc-nc-sa/gpl licensed typefaces? look for the master drawings of the
  existing typefaces and make an experimental reinterpretation of them using ofl/apache/cc-nc-sa/gpl
  licensing? contacting the actual foundries and authors of these proprietary typeface
  asking for using and interventions on these typefaces? should volunteers completely
  ignore the organization's brand manual when relating to typefaces when proprietary?\r\n\r\nI'm
  curious about, not only for your opinions, as well about references citing or approaching
  situations like this. Thanks!"

  body: "I\u2019d ask the organization if they can give you a license for the fonts
    in question. There are (even \u2018proprietary\u2019) licenses that allow this.\r\n\r\nJust
    because an organization doesn\u2019t work for profit doesn\u2019t mean they cannot
    spend any money on anything. Or are they using open-source offices/water/electricity
    as well? ;)\r\n\r\nI\u2019d say if the organization requires usage of certain
    fonts but cannot supply their designers with them, they have been given bad advice
    by their branding agency."

  body: "Another option is to have a kind of \"typesetter\" for putting out the final
    product. I'd argue that Gaussian distribution for \"typesetting skill\" will be
    the norm. Moreover,  with volunteers, that old, familiar bell-shaped curve will
    be rather farther along the \"not quite so good\" axis.\r\n\r\nSo, for either
    complex or \"branded\" (?) material, the files should go to someone with skill,
    mirroring the author -> editor -> compositor chain found in the commercial world.
    Only the \"compositor\" needs the actual, for-money fonts. The compositor(s) can
    be  volunteer(s), of course, the point is only her (their) machine(s) need the
    high-dollar fonts.\r\n"
