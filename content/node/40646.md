  sheet, how would I go about finding it? \r\n\r\nSecond question: Who else's type
  might have been used in Elzevir books?"

    this evening. \r\n\r\nHe explained that you can see the Van Dijck type by looking
    in \"Type specimen facsimiles\" edited by John Dreyfus and published in London
    in 1963.\r\n\r\nAlso, he explained that the small and famous early Elzevir books
    contain Garamond and Granjon made fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks James!"
