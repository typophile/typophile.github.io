  body: "I don't think this is a font, because some of the letters are hard to read
    (that 'a' is more like a 'q'), and because the identical letters don't look the
    same.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/kimmy/elizabeth-script/?refby=bowfin|Elizabeth
    Script]] is sort of uneven and quirky like your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    body: alright well would you be able to tell me if a typeface exists that looks
      a little more like this? If not what do you think letters like this were made
      from like a brush and ink or a bamboo pen?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6c98ef329bfc717761ec9da5219f8c4c_5882.jpg]

  body: "Good find Nick. Gizmo really has the feel of brush or bamboo pen  ink soaking
    unevenly into paper. I believe most readers would not notice that most letters
    are formed completely differently than the ID sample.\r\nDon"
