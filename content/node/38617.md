  local people expressed an interest in having a regular gathering for \u201Ctype
  geeks\u201D in Seattle. We had our first gathering last month and there was lots
  of enthusiasm to continue.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re going to meet at the Pub at 3rd Place
  books in Ravenna on Tuesday November 6th at 7:30pm. The pub is underneath the bookstore
  at the corner of 65th Street and 20th Avenue NE. http://www.3rdplacepub.com/\r\n\r\nNo
  meeting or agenda, just stop by and have a drink. \r\n\r\nMichelle\r\n"

    chapter of ATypI and SoTA board members will be present, so maybe the drinks will
    be on them? Or maybe not. '
