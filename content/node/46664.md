body: 'I have come upon 2 complete cabinets from Hamilton Mfg. co. Completely full
  of many different types and sizes of what appears to be steel lettering. Also have
  around 60- 70 picture plates from the late 1800''s to the 1960''s. Some with the
  articals to go with them. Also have printing letter box, and many extras to go with
  it. Including spare parts and several manuals and books for an intertype press.
  All were used in a small town newspaper. Newspaper is aprox. 130 years and still
  going. I am looking for a VERY knowledgable person to figure out what I have!!! '
