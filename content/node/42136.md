  body: Click on "My account" which appears on  the right-hand side of the page when
    viewing any page on Typophile. From there click "Edit". At that point you should
    be able to change your user name. If this is not an option for you, I can do it
    for you. Just let me know what you want your username to be.

    -> \u201CEdit\u201D -> \u201CAdditional information\u201D), not the user name
    itself. I would imagine full administrator rights are needed to change user names."
