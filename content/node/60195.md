body: My client has suggested that I use 'Frutiger Infant' for a children's book (it
  has a single storey 'a'). Does anyone have any idea which foundry this would originate
  from? Or perhaps it has been customised for a particular publisher...

    like it was possibly a custom job for them.

  body: "Thanks for your replies. I think an editor involved in this project previously
    worked for Cambridge University Press - which would explain this request. My client
    doesn't want to go to expense of having a customised font created. \r\nOptions
    for sans serif book fonts with an infant 'a' seem rather limited. Futura would
    be my choice, were it not for the question mark which seems rather jarring...
    Sassoon Primary looks a bit too young for our purposes... Super Grotesk is a possibility..."

  body: 'Florian, thanks very much for taking the time to compile this list. I think
    URW Grotesk is likely to be our choice for this situation. Proxima Nova is also
    a possibility, but I wonder if the larger x-height makes it a little less legible
    for younger readers. I will definitely be bookmarking the other fonts for future
    reference. '

  body: "Nice work on the list. I didn't realize so many of those had alternative
    a's.\r\n\r\nI believe the larger x-height actually helps in readability and probably
    legibility as well for children.\r\nI read a study a long time ago that tested
    that and I believe the higher the x-height, the better for children it was to
    read."

  body: "You\u2019re welcome.\r\nWhen compiling this list, I didn\u2019t pay regard
    to your original request, sorry. That is, I won\u2019t recommend most of those
    typefaces for setting a children\u2019s book (including URW Grotesk, for the reason
    Jens mentioned).\r\nIn my opinion, the significance of a single-storey \u2018a\u2019
    for children is, at least, debatable. Such a typeface might come in handy for
    teachers, when it is both used for reading and (as a model for) writing. Apart
    from that, the benefit of avoiding confusion of \u2018<em>a</em>\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019
    is soon outweighed by the potential \u2013\_and likely \u2013 confusion of \u2018<em>a</em>\u2019
    and \u2018<em>o</em>\u2019.\r\n\r\nChildren are not stupid, they can handle more
    than one representational form per character. Their world doesn\u2019t end at
    the edges of their primer. They do spot and effortlessly read a lot of different
    \u2018a\u2019 glyphs every day: caps, italics, serifs, sans-serifs, scripts, fat
    letters, condensed letters, single-storey and double-storey \u2026\r\n\r\n<cite>Sassoon

    children's publisher. At first glance I thought it was an oxymoron, but this thread
    convinces me otherwise; perhaps it has a larger x-height?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    it's never suprising to see how many editors continue to insist on customised
    and proprietary typefaces that belong to their former employers and previous jobs...
    maybe they should take up positions in sales & marketing instead."
