body: "An extensive search of \"Bulgarian Alphabet\" (in English) on the Internet
  reveals that the \"standard\" [[Cyrillic]] alphabet and fonts are used in [[Bulgaria]].
  There is nothing peculiar, except if one happens across the Hermes type foundry,
  or visits Bulgarian-language Cyrillic web sites and notices plain type styles with
  seeming Latin intrusions.\r\n\r\nHermes, in Bulgaria, is a quality outfit, with
  a good range of type styles, and all of them utilize a special Bulgarian alphabet.\r\nIn
  it, eleven upright (\"roman\") characters differ from the usual Cyrillic form, by
  using the Cyrillic italic forms -- either just straightened up, or with extenders,
  or stretched. In general the effect is one of Latinizing, despite the italic and
  script precedents for Cyrillic ascenders.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are at least eight
  accented/stressed characters (with grave accent) which are either not otherwise
  stressed in Cyrillic, or stressed with the dieresis instead.\r\n\r\nDetails of how
  to substitute these characters in OpenType fonts have been provided in the Build
  forum -- but I am interested here in the history, politics, people and practicality
  of the whole situation.\r\n\r\nThis is a movement which requires a group of type
  designers to be on side, as well as the local design community, and scholars, educationalists,
  orthographers, and government to some extent.\r\n\r\nSo what's the story?\r\nHow
  well established is the Hermes-flavoured Cyrillic alphabet in Bulgaria?\r\n\r\nAnd
  now that Bulgaria is in the European Union, will the Hermes-promoted Bulgar-Cyrillic
  alphabet become more entrenched there, and possibly make inroads elsewhere?\r\n"

    don't think we are going to see  any cultural 'improvements'  (the near future)\r\n
    Bulgaria   -- the EU's poorest member -- is facing more acute problems:  judicial
    reforms,  labor market , structural reforms, and more, and more, and more.....
    \r\n\r\nThe EU is nice thing, but don't forget the real life. Or -- as you know
    --  the frosting doesn't make the cake. \r\n"

  body: If I'm not mistaken, all of these 'variations' are not localized Bulgarian
    variations, but just Cyrillic cursive/italic script. Both are seen in most of
    the Slavic countries, and I'm pretty sure you can find signs in cursive if you
    look around Moscow.

    new.</cite>\r\n\r\nI think you are referring to the \u0432 (v), which rises to
    ascender height in some Cyrillic cursive forms so that it looks like modern forms
    of the Greek beta without a descender. This form also shows up outside of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for linking to the newspaper examples, Miguel. Most of them seem to be using a
    mix of different styles of Cyrillic typefaces&mdash;traditional, Bulgarian, and
    just standard Cyrillic cursive forms.\r\n\r\nBy standard Cyrillic cursive forms,
    I just mean that the forms used in the typical Cyrillic cursive have been adopted
    for the upright letters. Look at the <em>\u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434 (Trud)</em>
    example to see what I mean. Bulgarian forms go further and add ascenders on some
    of these letters, which I personally have a hard time liking. I get the need to
    break up the monotony of all the letters confined to the x height, but an ascender
    on the \u044E (yu) just seems illogical."
