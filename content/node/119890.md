  body: "I initially thought Ludlow 6-EC Gothic Extra Condensed, but its Q is different.
    This may be Hamilton Woodtype Class L (image from 1899-1900 catalog):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hamilton14-047_5752.jpg]\r\n\r\nDigital

  body: "I don't see an exact match. But here a few digital fonts based on condensed
    wood type to compare to your sample. I would focus on the issue of the ratio of
    width to height, the weight and the letter-forms of _R_ and _S_. An exact match
    would have the little kick on the end of the leg on _R_. Issues about other letters,
    including the tail on _Q_ are not a major problems as _Q_ is rarely used -- unless
    you are writing about the Queen :) \r\nSilvertone Woodtype, already suggested
