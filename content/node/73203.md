body: "hey everybody,\r\n\r\nI'm designing a logo for 'perron 20'. This is dutch for
  platform 20. They advise addicts about financial and social things by people who
  have been addicts themselves. 'Wij leven met je mee' means something like 'We feel
  empathy for you'. Keywords: professional, positive, open and warm. I used Livory
  by HVD fonts because it seems to radiate warmth and comfort. I like the look of
  it, but I think it needs an icon to symbolize what they do. Any commends are welcome!
  I've thought about something with a train or platform for an icon, but that's not
  what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\n\r\nJasper de Waard\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/perron20-3_3643.jpg]"

  body: "I'm not sure about that 'p' opening with the gap; it tends to be a saccation
    (stopping eye movement) with that gap from the stem. And '20' is way too tight
    in that circle, and they seem too thin. Does that font have lower case numbers?\r\n\r\nApart
    from those, the overall look is friendly and inviting."

  body: Thanks Tomi. The p is this way in the typeface and I like it this way. It
    doesn't have lowercase numbers. I just made the numbers lowercase by scaling them
    down, which, unfortunately, also made them thinner. My problem is that I don't
    want the circle to get any bigger than this, but I want 20 to align with the x-height.
    Any suggestions?

    in Holland aren't your audience. Recovering addicts in Holland are your audience,
    and they are also your clients. I don't know anything about addiction treatment
    in Holland, but in Germany there's even a song by an artist called Blossom (Bl\xFCmchen),
    \"Pink Cloud\" (\"Rosa Wolke,\" a bad little techno number, but the lyrics seem
    pretty clearly about the addiction recovery denial phenomenon to me, in either
    tongue).\r\n\r\nYou seem to know what you want, and I applaud that, but I'd still
    tell you the same. Livory is a handsome oldstyle face. But the invitation it sends
    to me is one from authority, rather than from a peer. Just things to consider.
    There are messages in our fonts...!\r\n\r\nGood luck with the client!"

  body: "<cite>\"Livory is a handsome oldstyle face. But the invitation it sends to
    me is one from authority, rather than from a peer.\"</cite>\r\nYes, I agree. I've
    been looking at this a few times and while it does look nice, the \xABtone\xBB
    seems slightly off for the audience and situation you're communicating in. Consider
    that communication doesn't only involve <em>what</em> is being said and <em>how</em>
    the tone/voice feels to yourself, but there's also the question of <em>who</em>
    is speaking to <em>whom</em> (and how those people are made to feel). In the situation
    you describe, I'd also expect something that communicates more from peer to peer.
    Livory is beautiful, but it does evoke the old age of book wisdom, a printed \xE6sthetic,
    where knowledge \u2013 and help \u2013 was a much more hierarchical and authoritarian
    affair. This tone of \xABauthority\xBB is one you would exactly want to avoid,
    I guess \u2013 it might feel ever so slightly patronizing (I'm assuming your target
    audience might be very sensitive to how their situation is presented or referred
    to). You need something that communicates at eye level; something that's fresher
    and straighter without being cold, something honest and strong, not this artistic/\xABbookish\xBB
    and soft. Warmth is good, but not condescending warmth \u2013 warmth at eye level.\r\n\r\nOn
    a more \xABsurface\xBB level, one thing that makes me find Livory a wrong choice
    in this context is that if you look at the actual shapes of the characters, it
    seems sad rather than strong. There are a lot of \xABfrowning\xBB shapes. The
    top-left instrokes of the \"p\", \"n\", and \"r\" all droop down. The opening
    of the \"p\" also makes it look sad to me. The overall softness (which looks eroded,
    like something was washed away) says everything <em>but</em> freshness, strength,
    youth, and being able to rebound from something that's as hard to overcome as
    addiction.\r\n\r\nIn case I sound harsh: I like the font too, but I'm trying to
    look past my own taste and think into what it needs to communicate in this case,
    and I think it's miscast, like a good actor in the wrong role. \r\n\r\nBTW, what's
    with the railway metaphor? Is that important to the client, should it be played
    off? (You don't need to draw a train icon, but maybe use a font that could be
    used in railway signage or something?)"

    It's quite a complicated organisation to sum up in a logo. For this reason I think
    your interpretation of warmth and approachability is appropriate. Now you must
    choose how to communicate these ideas. Beyond emotive choices it is a graphic
    exercise, weight, proportion, relationship, essentially creating a kind of neatness
    or harmony.\r\n\r\nConsider the regular demands of a logo; must work at different
    scales, possibly in black only."
