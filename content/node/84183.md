  this logo in illustrator and I am having some difficulty identifying both typefaces.
  The script is similar to Flemish Script, but it is definitely not it. \r\nThis logo
  was designed in the USA less than 10 years ago. Thanks everyone!\r\nAlexis\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/awning_5542.png]"

  body: Thanks Stephen, it looks like you might be right. The type is a bit distorted,
    because of the angle from which the photograph was taken, but I'm pretty sure
    you got the right typefaces.
