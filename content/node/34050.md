    haven\u2019t found anything closer either. Thanks.\r\nFunny thing is I browsed
    through the transitional category on myfonts and didn\u2019t come across Esquire."

  body: "If you compare Esquire and Bitstream's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-731/\">Century
    731</a> you will see they are 'identical' (I put that in quotes because there
    are always some variations in digitizations of the same design). The signature
    of this typeface is the ear on the 'g'. Scangraphic has a history of changing
    names on their typefaces if they do not have the rights to use the 'correct' name.
    This is much like Bitstream's and URW's agreements with the foundries whose libraries
    they helped digitize. \r\n\r\nThe original name of this typeface, I still believe,
    is 'Textype' and it was designed by C. H. Griffith for Mergenthaler Linotype in
    1929, as a newspaper type (See McGrew pp306-7) \r\n- Mike Yanega"

      - is there a link to english typographic terminology) seems closer in Esquire."

  body: "I've done some more reading in McGrew and it seems that Griffith also designed
    a typeface called Excelsior for Linotype two years after Textype. Excelsior had
    a greater x-height, and in the metal version, came with either long or short descenders.
    Otherwise it's almost impossible (for me) to tell them apart. They both have the
    same ear on the 'g'. It makes sense to me that 'Esquire' is the digitization of
    'Excelsior', since most of the time Scangraphic used the same initial letter as
    the original typeface name.\r\n\r\nFurther, this one may have fooled the FontBook
    folks too, because they show 'Esquire' as based on the 1929 Griffith design (Textype),
    when Excelsior was designed in 1931. BTW, Linotype has its own digital version
    of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/excelsior/\">Excelsior</a>.
    Does that match any better?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
