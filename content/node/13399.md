body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Foundries]] : ITC - International Typeface Corporation</strong>\r\n\r\nOne
  of the older foundries around with a formidable library of classics. Founded in
  1970 by [[Aaron Burns]], [[Herb Lubalin]], and [[Edward Ronthaler]], New York, NY.\r\n\r\nITC
  revolutionized the type business by ushering in the era of <strong>licensing</strong>.
  ITC licensed typefaces from designers, and then licensed those designs to typesetting
  device manufacturers (like Linotype, Monotype, Berthold, etc.). These licensees
  were free to \"adapt\" the design to fit their machines. In the case of Berthold,
  this was done quite a lot, as G\xFCnter Gerhard Lange, their type director, had
  very high standards. The original type designers where paid royalties\u2014about
  ten percent\u2014on these sales.\r\n\r\nTypesetters and graphic designers did not
  license fonts directly from ITC until the digital-era ended the reign of proprietary
  typesetting equipment. But today, anyone can license the typefaces through a simple
  download process. Visit <a href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com\">http://www.itcfonts.com</a>
  to see the collection.\r\n\r\nFrom 1974 until 1999, ITC published a groundbreaking
  design magazine, [[Upper and Lowercase | U&lc]]. Lubalin edited this from 1974 until
  his death in 1981. The last editor of U&lc was [[John D. Berry]]. \r\n\r\nSome of
  ITC's designers include: [[Edward Benguiat]], [[Tom Carnese]], [[Matthew Carter]],
  [[Antonio DiSpigna]], [[Justin Howes]], [[Erik Spiekermann]], [[Tony Stan]], [[Frantisek
  Storm]], and [[Hermann Zapf]].\r\n\r\nIn 1986, ITC was purchased by [[Esselte Letraset]].
  Today, the company is a subsidiary of [[Monotype Imaging]].\r\n\r\nURL: <a href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com\">http://www.itcfonts.com</a>"
