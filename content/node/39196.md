    of the fat rounded wurst face, to me, is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/frankfurter/familytree.html\">Frankfurter</a>."

  body: Thanks guys. Also, by "cunky" I meant "chunky". But I would love to see what

  body: "There are a couple versions of this style. One is Lineto's Kada, the other
    is a <a href=\"http://wearebuild.com/projects/d-and-ad\">custom proprietary font</a>
    by Michael C. Place (Build) which is based on an old film or transfer face.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want an alternative without stencils, go for the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/376112212/\">Gusto</a>."
