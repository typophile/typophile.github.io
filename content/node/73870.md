  space this letter creates in all caps setting or is there a chance this will be
  mistaken for an <strong>I</strong>, as it is designed this here:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/ag-schoolbook-bq/\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_schulbuch_sud_normal/\r\n\r\nI'd
  rather the J I am drawing didn't (truly) drop below the baseline.\r\n\r\nHow many
  are familiar with the <strong>I</strong> as it appears in AG Schoolbook BQ Regular
  and FF Schulbuch S\xFCd or is this a relative anomaly? Is this style of <strong>I</strong>
  only common in Germany?\r\n\r\nMany thanks"

    provided it doesn\u2019t extend all the way to the left (see Verdana, for example)."

    WITH the crossbar as shown in the sample. It has an oddly cursive look to it;
    weird at the very least. I don't get that at all with the <strong>J</strong> without
    the crossbar, to the point that I don't see how anyone could. There might be a
    cultural bias working here.\r\n\r\nHowever I do appreciate having an <strong>I</strong>
    with serifs in an otherwise sans font, if only to reinforce distinction between
    it and lowercase L.\r\n\r\nA descending hook on your cap J would allow for tighter
    kerning in all caps settings, resolving the white space issue, but that's not
    a suitable design decision for every situation."

  body: 'To clarify what I mean by cultural bias: If the second pair of samples are
    both <strong>I</strong>,  with both a hooked and straight form; the hooked form
    is never used in American English as anything but a <strong>J</strong>. I am not
    familiar with the current use of a hooked <strong>I</strong>, though I understand
    that the modern J is derived from that.'

    true, I certainly hadn't thought of that. Truly, I'm a bit uncomfortable with
    a descending <strong>J</strong>.\r\n\r\nLet me rephrase my question slightly,
    to avoid any confusion: \r\n\r\nI intended to use a short, serifed <strong>J</strong>
    and a standard <strong>I</strong>. Will some readers (presumably when reading
    isolated words) mistake this short serifed <strong>J</strong> for an <strong>I</strong>
    drawn as it appears in Schoolbook Regular? \r\n\r\n(I don't mean to ask about
    confusion between <strong>J</strong> and <strong>I</strong> when both are serifed
    and hooked - this is another problem/thread!)\r\n\r\nAny native German speakers
    familiar with the Schoolbook styled <strong>I</strong> that is so alien to me?\r\n\r\n(Just
    to clarify in the initial image the characters in all four samples are <strong>JI</strong>.)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nas its name implies Schulbuch/Schoolbook typefaces have been made
    particularly for school / educational books or are modified versions of existing
    typefaces \u2013 e.g. AG Schulbuch is a modified version of Akzidenz Grotesk Buch.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    no coincidence that this specific /I/-form reminds of Italics and/or handwriting.\r\n\r\nIn
    Germany, pupils were/are taught a standardised form script/handwriting (one of
    them is called Lateinische Ausgangsschrift, but there are several revisions).\r\nIt
    was assumed that seizing the letter forms pupils were used to, e.g. the one storey
    /a/ and the /I/ like the one you mentioned would ease the recognition of particular
    letters and therefore improve the overall readability and legibility for reading
    rookies.\r\nQuite likely, the \u2018abstract\u2019 look of a Grotesk /I/ \u2013
    a simple vertical line \u2013 was an issue, too.\r\n\r\nThe one-storey /a/ and
    /g/, the hooked lc /l/, the spurless G and the peculiar /I/ could also be considered
    an atavistic parallel to German blackletter letterforms. Even though blackletter
    wasn\u2019t taught anymore in school at that time it was still way more present
    than it is today. And in blackletter (and therefore in Germany until WW2), the
    differentiation between /I/ and /J/ has not been popular till the late 19th century
    / early 20th century. This potential parallel might be a reason why a single-storey
    /a/ and /g/ and a hooked lc /l/ are still looked upon as being \u2018German\u2019
    by some.\r\nUntil then, it was most common to have one glyph for both /I/ and
    /J/ which either sits on the baseline or drops it, but always with some kind of
    crossbar and in the shape of what (nowadays) most people would read as a /J/.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    being German, I doubt that a lot of people in Germany would misread this specific
    one as an /I/. In a custom font I made two years ago (a Geometric Grotesk), I
    used a /J/ with a crossbar similar to the /I/ in Schulbuch S\xFCd, the /I/ being
    a simple vertical stroke. I didn\u2019t hear of complaints about ambiguity or
    the danger of confusion so far\u2026"

    does sound like this is an acceptable format today. Neuzeit for example uses this
    combination, though the <strong>J</strong> is not hooked."

  body: "I grew up in Germany, and I clearly remember that I was annoyed by the J-style
    I's used in the children's books by a particular publisher. I later understood
    the reason (which aarhaus explained very well), but I still dislike them. They
    were and are confusing, and they don't help in learning to read <em>at all</em>,
    especially when you're surrounded by Grotesk I's in real life.*\r\n\r\nMy point,
    though, is that I've seen Schulbuch-I's looking like J's <em>without</em> a crossbar.
    In fact, I now think they sometimes used the J glyph from the font to \"make our
    life easier\" (how belittling \u2013 need we really be protected from the cold,
    mean world with all its scary Grotesk I's?)\r\n\r\nSo, to answer your question:
    it doesn't matter whether you give the J a crossbar or not. But <em>please</em>,
    everyone, leave the I as it is. Let's work together to stop this \"Schulbuch\"
    madness :)\r\n\r\n(btw, one could argue German doesn't need the letter J at all
    ...)\r\n\r\n*I also don't remember having difficulties deciphering double-story
    a's and g's."
