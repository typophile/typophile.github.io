  body: 'They used to use Kabel Bold for as long as I can remember. MTV doesn&#39;t
    show many videos anymore &#40;how&#39;s that for being antithetical&#41; so I&#39;m
    finding it difficult to remember if they still do use Kabel or not. If someone
    actually catches a video in-between repeats of Cribs, Real World/Road Rules, and
    the self-congratulatory pseudo-reminiscent programming, please let us know. '
