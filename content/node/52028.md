body: Can anyone identified this font, or something close. I am designing a 3 letter
  logo which this would be perfect. Or if there are any type designers would be interested
  in re-drawing it let me know. Thanks for the help. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/type3_5510.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/type3_5510.jpg]

  body: Which letters? I could hand trace these pretty quickly, and probably produce
    letters related in form quite good. I'm definitly not the most experienced person
    here, but I might give it a shot.
