  rips the work of a logo designer, posts it on stockart and then stockart sends a
  bill for 18K to the designer, calls him a fraud and tries to extort the money by
  calling up his clients and badmouthing him. \r\n\r\nBeautiful business model.\r\n\r\nPS.
  Jon is an active and visible member of LogoPond community. There's a lot of people
  who can vouch for him and his work. It is <em>extremely</em> unlikely that he was
  ripping other people's work.\r\n\r\nPPS. In the light of recent news I edited the
  subject of the topic."
