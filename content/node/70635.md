  body: "I think <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/life/\">Life Bold</a>
    is fairly close, but I don't think this is an exact match. The image quality makes
    the ID tougher, because I am not sure how much serif detail was lost from the
    original.\r\n\r\nThis font seems similar to Times, except for the S serifs. These
    letters are not the best for ID purposes either.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
