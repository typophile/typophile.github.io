  classes, smcp1 and smcp2 which contain the lowercase and small caps.\r\nIn the Opentype
  window I have the feature 'smcp' with\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfeature smcp {\r\n  sub @smcp1
  by @smcp2;\r\n} smcp;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I compile I get the following warning:\r\n\r\nFeature
  block seen before any language system statement.  You should place language system
  statements before any feature definition.\r\n\r\nWhat is a language system statement?\r\n\r\nHow
  do I place language system statements before any feature definition."
