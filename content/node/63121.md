  body: 'Are these business cards then? I like the icon but some of the detail may
    get lost at small sizes. Also I''d work on your grouping. boo-ya-bass needs to
    associate with the phone number and not the logotype. '

  body: "Agreed about the detail. I would make the pot smaller and the steam bigger.
    Also separate the icon, logo and phonetical spelling from the contact info as
    Nick said.\r\n\r\nIs the black a working color or final? The black and white is
    not very appetizing."

  body: "Maybe try to remove the lid and make like two or three highly visible steam
    elements so you have a logo that can easily be reproduced. Furthermore I would
    really like to know more about the company. Thinking of clich\xE9s I would use
    red and yellow maybe a dark, not too highly saturated green if you want to emphazise
    the cafe.\r\n\r\nRegarding to typography I'd reconsider the kerning of 'Cafe'.
    It looks very loose compared to 'Bouillabaisse'. Especially the 'C-a' feels a
    bit strange. Personally I think that the typeface works for the additional information
    but it doesn't do the trick for the company's name. It feels so constructed which
    conflicts with deli in some way.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I do get some vibes from it but
    I think you can still improve your current approach."

  body: "wow this site is amazing.  i'll definitely try out the suggestions later
    today.  \r\n\r\nken-really?  i dont understand why you think the booyabass needs
    to be associated with the secondary info, i think its successful as part of the
    logo typ\r\n\r\njayyy-the black and white is the working color, essentially bouillabaisse
    is a very low budget sandwich shop in east baltimore.  the only colors that they
    can afford and that are easiest for them to reproduce are black and white.  unless
    anyone has other suggestions of handling the money/color problem, i'm probably
    going to stick with the black and white and make it work.  a teacher of mine would
    always say that graphic design is all about problem solving, and i think the black
    and white is a problem that can be solved with some creativity and elbow grease.
    \ thanks for your input, i'll definitely sit on your words \r\n\r\nsimplicious-i'll
    try a revised version with variations of steam and post it up very soon."

  body: "This probably won't help, but I'm going to say that I really like the mark
    as-is. Yes, there could be an issue with printing it small. Maybe that needs to
    be addressed. But as it is here, I like it. The small wisp of steam is just right,
    IMHO.\r\n\r\nNow, the type needs some work. I'm not getting a real sense of hierarchy
    on the card. Maybe try establishing the hierarchy with size rather than font-style?"

    mark as well.  I will definitely mess with the type right now. "

    like the name and the concept for the logo but the steam does seem a little of
    an afterthought, enlarge it or get rid of it entirely.\r\n\r\nWill"

    cute. Nothing tops off a cute cafe like a cute logo with nice little details.\r\n"
