  But I can't quite figure out what typefaces they're using. \r\n\r\nA couple of serif
  examples... \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_Typophile_PM_serif01_3441.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_Typophile_PM_serif02_4873.jpg]\r\n\r\nA
  couple of sans serif examples... \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_Typophile_PM_sans01_5435.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_Typophile_PM_sans02_3890.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd

  body: The serif is <a href=http://ourtype.be/>Arnhem</a> (the funky "g" gives it
    away), and the sans looks to be <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans>Benton
    Sans</a>.

  body: The sans is probably Benton Sans or Trade Gothic Next, both of which are reworkings
    of Trade Gothic and its ilk and include the range of weights and widths required
    for publication work.
