body: "hi all,\r\n\r\nI have an InDesign question I hope somebody can help with. I
  have a document with numerous statements such as:\r\n\r\n\"To select, press s2.\"\r\n\r\n\"s2\"
  refers to a button, and I would like to represent that with a custom image or glyph
  which is not part of the font. The only way I know now is to create the artwork
  in Illustrator and manually place it. You can imagine with many instances this might
  become prohibitively cumbersome.\r\n\r\nIs there a process for enabling this custom
  glyph to flow with the copy in some automated way (rather than manually placing
  a separate piece of artwork)? I know for example, that I can do a find and replace
  with \"s2\" and a glyph - BUT that glyph is part of the font. I want the glyph to
  be independent of the font in the sense that \"s2\" should be represented by the
  same image regardless of whether the copy is set in Helvetica, Futura, etc.\r\n\r\nthanks
  much,\r\njarrod\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    into a font*) to use the \"More Options\" in the \"Find/Change\" panel to set
    the desired font using the \"Format\" panel of the target glyph.\r\n\r\n* Maybe
    you\u2019re able to draw it with Fontstruct?"

  body: That last tip is really hot, I remember it made for instance the setting of
    long flowing paragraps of music reviews a lot easier in a magazine I did ... the
    cover art just flowed with the formatting of the rest of the text. Also, I believe
    InDesign has a way to create ome sort of "library" of symbols (images etc) you
    can have open as a toolbar and insert freely. So there are many ways around this.
    Remeber you may have to format the inserted image with the appropriate line spacing
    etc, like text.
