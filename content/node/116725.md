  body: "Good variety of English vernacular Roman lettering. In particular I love
    the _G_ in the first image, which looks like it's sucking a lemon!\r\nSome of
    these memorial lettering designs were turned into full alphabets. For example
    check out the book by Day called _Alphabets_ from circa 1900. As for digital versions,
    there are no exact matches but you might be interested in some of the fonts by
    Greater Albion Typefounders http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Greater_Albion_Typefounders/\r\nDon"
