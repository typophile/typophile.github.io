  style=\"font-size:80px;\">Bolda</strong>\r\nI'm currently working on a new font,
  'Bolda'. I have worked on it for quite some time now and i'm starting to feel that
  i'm never gonna finish... I guess it is a very normal feeling when you're designing
  a font... \r\n\r\nThe last time i made a custom font was almost three years ago,
  i have totallty forgot how much work it i takes. \r\n\r\nI'm done with all the basic
  latin letters, the rest is the difficult part, making the norwegian letters \xE6
  \xF8 \xE5...\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.morteniveland.net\r\n"

    did I fail to find the samples on your site?\r\n\r\nThe g looks like a q, BTW.
