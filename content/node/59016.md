  body: Shouldn't the system fonts be on the OS install CD? (Can't check at the moment,
    sorry!)

  body: While the system fonts would be included with the OS installer discs, they
    might be tied up in the installer packages and not freely copyable file-by-file.
    I'll have a look myself to confirm.

  body: 'Yup, at least on the Leopard discs, all the files are locked up in installer
    packages. I didn''t try running the installer app to see if the fonts could be
    selected and installed without the rest of the OS X going in with them. '
