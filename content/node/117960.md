  body: "Lizbug12, I think you meant Avenir Roman, which is available here for $29
    (though I think DPape's call for the lighter weight is correct):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/avenir/\r\n\r\nThere
    are fonts called Avenue, but not a match to your sample:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/avenue/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/funk-king/avenue/"

  body: 'The stationary site calls it Avenue Roman and they suggested a font called
    Full Circle. Tinyprints is the site if you want to test it. Thanks for the help
    in advance. '

  body: '@Lizbug12 -- Just a FYI: stationery companies are famous for renaming the
    fonts they offer to make it difficult for consumers to match. The consumer can''t
    find it elsewhere under that name so assumes they can only get it at one company.'
