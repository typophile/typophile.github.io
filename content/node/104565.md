  body: I do not think it is lettered by hand, perhaps designed with a computer software,
    but i really think it is an existing font.

  body: "You need to read the EULA of the digital typefaces \u2014 some allow modification(s),
    some not. \r\n\r\nFor a simple mod (eg a logo or such) converting to outline in
    Adobe Illustrator is the easiest starting point. For more extensive reworking
    you would need pro software like Glyphs or FontLab. There are open source apps
    out there, like FontForge I guess, but I have no experience with that."
