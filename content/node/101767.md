  the attached image. I've tried running it through the font identification sites,
  cleaning it up, again and then again, but to no luck. Along with some endless google
  searches and font site trawling, but nothing seems quite right. As usual, I'm hoping
  humans may be able to triumph over the machines!\r\n\r\nAny help much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSteve"
