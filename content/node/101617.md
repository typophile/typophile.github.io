    was created by doing a 50/50 vector blend of the fonts \u201CUbuntu Bold\u201D
    and \u201CMister Giacco Bold,\u201D and it was tweaked from there. [...] I found
    Giacco Bold by running the title logo from the Super Nintendo video game of the
    same name through online font identification tools (such as whatfontis.com and
    whatthefont, I believe). I thought I might use Mister Giacco Bold as the logo
    and header font for my web site earthbound.io, partly just because I like it,
    but also because it's stylistically similar in ways to the font of said video
    game. I was very close to using it, however, I took another look through my font
    collection, and noticed it is strikingly similar to Ubuntu Bold. I was then undecided
    whether to use Giacco or Ubuntu, which led to the idea to blend them into one
    font, which I tried, and I love the result. I hope you may enjoy and find uses
    for it as well. If you do, please credit me and link to earthbound.io.</blockquote>"

  body: "I didn't, sorry.\r\n\r\nAlex, it's probably an honest mistake (one that many
    people unwittingly make) but re-using the outlines of a commercial font is not
    OK. Even if a person thinks it's ethically OK (which I personally don't) it's
    actually legally not OK because the outlines are essentially code that define
    a font, so they're copyrighted. You're OK on the Ubuntu end, but not the Giacco
    end... So unless you get permission from Diego Giaccone and Sudtipos, to do the
    right -and legal- thing, you'd have to pull it, and redraw it (or not). Sorry
    for the bad news.  :-/\r\n\r\nAnd of course somebody making a derivative of Earthbound
    isn't OK either.\r\n\r\nHere's an idea: put Giacco in the background layer, and
    modify Ubuntu while referring to Giacco.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    frankly floored that sending outlines through an algorithm--no matter how much
    it alters the outline--I'm floored that this may not be OK. But on the other hand,
    if I had personally spent a lot of time and care creating an outline that someone
    else did that with, I can imagine myself not being OK with that.)\r\n\r\nAlso,
    your suggestion (hrant) for reworking it sounds doable. (I was also thinking of
    redrawing guide contours from scratch, with both fonts as reference, and stroking
    those with a uniform width--if I'm using the right terms there--because I wonder
    if the stroke widths are uneven.)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it looks like I better take
    down the release, and the .pdf sample here, which I think has the font embedded,
    and upload a revision at openfontlibary.org that only uses \"Mr. Giacco\" as visual
    reference.\r\n\r\nBart, I frankly read that as a snarky way to expose me to potential
    trouble I was unaware of (I don't know whether I misread you there), but I may
    have a mind to call your bluff (if indeed you were having fun with me as I suppose),
    and find out Diego Giaccone's opinion directly.\r\n\r\nAssuming the attached .png

    version you can/should contact both Giaccone and Sudtipos and explain yourself.
    Unless they're crazy protectionists (of which there certainly are some out there,
    believe me) they will forgive your mistake and respect your corrective action.\r\n\r\nTo
    be honest, if you don't announce that you re-used outlines it's hard for people
    to prove it; they can certainly <em>feel</em> it, but it's not actionable. So
    much of the junk on Dafont, etc. is covertly plagiarized, it's sad. And doubly
    sad when you have to watch people on the ID section of Typophile -which is essentially
    the watering hole of type design- suggest such fonts... And when you merely raise
    a red flag, they even have the gall to whine about being bullied... Clearly they
    don't want ethics cramping their style! But of course keeping such a shady genesis
    secret wouldn't make it OK - it might in fact make it less OK.\r\n\r\nBTW if Bart
    was indeed sending you into a trap, I can see where he's coming form. There's
    so much cavalier, remorse-less plagiarism going on, and so few people willing
    to change their attitude, that it can feel like the only way to get people to
    stop is to scar them. Me, I try the soft touch first (not that that always works

    Giaccone,\r\n\r\nI reused your work (and/or your company's work) on \"Mr. Giacco
    Bold,\" in combination with \"Ubuntu Bold,\" by way of the \"Blend\" tool in FontLab.
    I was very pleased with the result, and further adapted it to a font which I released
    at openfontlibrary.org --\r\n\r\n[URL removed my moderator]\r\n\r\n-- and I notified
    the community about this work, at typophile.com --\r\n\r\n[URL removed my moderator]\r\n\r\n--
    to discover their wise caution that I have perhaps done something illegal (although
    that was certainly never my intent).\r\n\r\nPlease advise. I will happily remove
    the font from openfontlibrary.org if that is your wish (and on the presumption
    that this is best, I have already sent an email to the site owners there, advising
    them to take it down).\r\n\r\nI will also happily make the source files available
    to you if you are unable to find them at openfontlibrary.org by the time you read
    this.\r\n\r\nI would of course also be happy to find any legal arrangement that
    would allow for the distribution of a derivative work, such as what I had developed
    for a font entitled \"Earthbound.\"\r\n\r\nWith admiration for your work,\r\n\r\nAlex

    [SPAM] An amateur font designer's legal goof\r\n\r\nHello\r\nWe do not allow any
    modification of our fonts and of course we do not\r\nallow free distribution.
    The use of our outlines for derivative work is\r\nprotected by law.\r\nI assume
    you don't have the original MrGiacco license too.\r\nPlease remove all the fonts
    from everywhere as soon as possible we would\r\nnot like to take any legal action
    on that.\r\n\r\n----\r\nFrom: [me]\r\nTo: [sudtipos]\r\nRe: [SPAM] An amateur
    font designer's legal goof\r\n\r\nAs my previous email stated, I have notified
    openfontlibrary.org that it is advisable they take down the font (it seems that
    their infrastructure provides no facilities for a submitter to take down what
    they have posted). I have seen no reply from them; perhaps it's only a matter
    of time before they see my email (it's only been half a day). I have given as
    much effort to openness and honesty about the circumstance as could reasonably
    be expected, and it is now out of my hands.\r\n\r\nIt's a great looking derivative
    work, in my opinion, and I'm disappointed that an admiring inquiry about the potential
    use of it (and if I may say so, my brazen confession about my genuine lack of
    awareness of the legal ramifications of my work) would be marked as [SPAM]. I'm
    attaching the sources. I hope you will reconsider adapting this work which is
    rightfully yours, and if you do so, I wouldn't be offended if you send me a complimentary
    personal font license of the result :)\r\n\r\nConveniently, if indeed my inquiry
    was \"spam,\" or unsolicited email, I suppose your reply is also, which makes
    it public domain, so that I may amuse myself to publicly post my inquiry, with
    your company's cold reply :)\r\n----"

      misread Sudtipos (and Bart).\r\n\r\nI'll take solace in that I've done my best
      to repair my blunder.\r\n\r\nI've looked into pulling together a quick and dirty
      rework using only the \"Ubuntu\" font, in compliance with their license, to
      post an update which would replace it with such a revision (effectively deleting
      the old), but it turns out the change wouldn't be substantial enough to warrant
      renaming the font per their license terms (it would have to be \"Ubuntu revision
      X by Y\" or something like that), so that it would have to end up at a different
      URL (and therefore not overwrite the old version).\r\n\r\nSo I think my last
      comment would be that if you bold \"Ubuntu\" by 35 em and condense it by 88
      percent, it looks pretty cool. (And it's legal to do so, if you follow their
      license terms!) Not as cool as it might look to blend the vectors from that
      with \"Mr. Giacco,\" but whoops--we can't do that! :/"
