body: "I incorporated the typeface from an identity I did for a seminary into a magazine
  I'm designing. Now, I'm having second thoughts.\r\n\r\nDo you think Mackinac Book
  is challenging to read as body copy? If so, what are your thoughts on other typefaces
  that would maintain its feel and pair well with it and Gotham, the sans serif I'm
  using?\r\n\r\nI dislike mixing type too much, but what if I only replace the body,
  and keeping the pull quotes (Book Italic) and headers (Medium) in Mackinac? Can
  it work? Some of the slab serifs with the same high x height, low cap height and
  very rounded O's and almost work.\r\n\r\nMy deepest gratitude to anyone who deigns
  to answer my query!\r\n\r\n- Martha"

    it doesn\u2019t appear have legibility issues.\r\nHowever, if you can\u2019t get
    it to work to your satisfaction as body, but like the general appearance, ITC
    Cheltenham would be a \u201Csafe\u201D alternative."

  body: 'Yes, that''s how I had Mackinac sized. It''s the low ascenders that make
    it bit challenging when reading. It''s not terrible, but I don''t want to trouble
    readers. '

  body: "So, if I don't want a safe choice, but something a bit more interesting,
    anyone have some additional suggestions for a typeface with a large x height,
    low cap height, full body?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "Wait, so you're sure you're shooting for smaller size settings? If so, why?\r\n\r\nYou
    can be \"unsafe\" aesthetically, but to me being unsafe functionally is not Design,
    it's Art. What I'm getting at is: wanting a large x-height for aesthetic reasons
    seems reckless.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I just meant something maybe less conservative than Cheltenham. (Mackinac
    at 8 pt., it is the equivalent of Garamond at 10 pt.)\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a
    typeface that will be be in keeping, or play well with, the font in a logo\u2014Mackinac
    Bold. I've used Mackinac Book as body in some ephemera for my client, but it wasn't
    until I saw it as a full page that I realized it's not great choice for a magazine.
    If I were reckless, I would have kept it. But surely there are other typefaces
    that have larger x-heights and would be legible. Clarendon, for instance, isn't
    bad, right? However, I always wish there were a step between regular and bold.
    I was just looking at Calluna. I doesn't have any of the softness of Mackinac,
    but would be an easy read. Or maybe I'm stressing the wrong quality, and the fuller
    body is more important?\r\n\r\nI've attached the logo for reference. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BexSea_logo_OL_FNL_5377.jpg]"

    apparent size maybe, but not in readability.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to say is
    the font you choose can nicely accompany the Mackinac logo without having to match
    its proportions.\r\n\r\nSo: Let's find a \"soft\" and -optionally- wide serif
    face with a modest x-height.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
