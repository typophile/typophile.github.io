  of good typeface design, with hundreds of examples and lessons and a good history
  of type.

  body: Mr. Osborne, <BR> <BR>I too have searched for such a manual and have yet to
    find one all encompasing &#34;Manual&#34;. I have found several books that cover
    a lot of info on typography and you have to piece together the parts you need.
    The closest I have come to a &#39;Manual&#34; is a book called &#34;Logo, font
    &amp; lettering bible&#34; by Leslie Cabarga ISBN 1-58180-436-9. It has tons of
    tips and lots of examples of big name designers/letterers. Another must have is
    &#34;The Elements of Typographic Style&#34; by Robert Bringhurst  ISBN 0-88179-132-6.
    He deals more in depth with traditional type and the history of type. But a good
    understanding of those things are important even in today&#39;s funky styles.
    Bringhurst also deals with traditional page styling techniques. The first one
    is like Rock &#39;n Roll of typography and the second like heavy Classical music.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ve also found that hanging around this forum is a big help. There are
    a lot of experts that don&#39;t seem to proud to pass on what they&#39;ve learned.
    I hope this helps. <BR> <BR>-another Jefferson
