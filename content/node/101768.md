body: "Hi, Everyone\r\n\r\nFirst post...but don't go easy on me! :)\r\n\r\nI'm doing
  my final project at University in Graphic Design and have created a brand for a
  range of clothing and accessories to be sold in the store Go Outdoors. It aims to
  raise awareness of the issues of not enough children getting outside, exercising
  and experiencing the benefits of nature. I have attached what I have so far for
  the brand but I'm painfully aware that it doesn't strike a cord with the correct
  target market (children). The main concept behind it is to use the initals of GO
  and P from Play to create a tree shape. I think it is the tree shape itself that
  looks out of place and perhaps too corporate, I'm looking for advice on how I can
  keep the concept but make it more attractive to a younger audience.\r\n\r\nAny help
  is appreciated!"

  body: I'd suggest making the type larger and drawing the tree in a more casual,
    freeform style, and try using a different color (or at least a different shade
    of green) inside each of the 3 circles.

    pixels wide?

    They should be easily capable to create/post smaller images. And especially since
    this logo doesn''t have such detail that this huge image would make any sense...'
