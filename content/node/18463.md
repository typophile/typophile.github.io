  rather far, I've started to work on an italic for it.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to create
  a normal italic, which is quite slanted with adaptions, and another one which is
  more like italics for Antiqua (i used the opentype swash-feature for it).\r\n\r\nSo
  I will have:\r\n\r\nUppercase normal + swash\r\nlowerase  normal + swash\r\nmaybe
  smallcaps normal\r\n\r\n\r\nI've developed the first version from the roman one,
  first giving it a slant of 8\xB0, and then finetuning it. I was not quite happy
  with that, so I made copies and created the swash-versions, which are much further
  away from the roman.\r\n\r\nI am quite happy with the swash-characters now: they
  need finetuning for sure, and I am happy about any comment which characters still
  appear to be \"roman\", or which one won't work.\r\nMore problems exist with the
  \"normal\" version: I think this is too near to the roman yet. Which features of
  the swash-ones should I carry back to the normal one too?\r\nYou can find an overview
  for this problem on page 3 in the pdf (red is indesign-slanted version of the roman,
  being there for comparison). On page one on the bottom, you can see both versions,
  on the left is the normal one, on the right the swashes.\r\n\r\nIs there a need
  for italic smallcaps?\r\n\r\nThanks again for your comments\r\nSebilar\r\n\r\n<strong>More
