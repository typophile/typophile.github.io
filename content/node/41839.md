  google (site:www.typophile.com)...and can't find it:\r\nI saw a post (it must be
  a 6 months or less from now) where someone show a link to a simple page (It was
  a portfolio of someone) that presentend the work of someone. The page had like 50
  small squares with a thumbnail of the work and when you rollover or click on a image
  it show the same picture big. It was a PHP or javascript page.\r\nDoes anyone knows
  where is it?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio Fonseca"

    ( I think ) PHP, flash, java etc.\r\n\r\nIf you posted a comment that might help
    you find it because you can track the threads that contain your posts. Did you?"
