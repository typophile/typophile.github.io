body: What are the legal issues involved with buying used softare? For instance, Ebay
  lists some older software &#40;for those of us who still use Mac OS 9&#41;. Are
  there other places to get older software? <BR> <BR>What about transferring a font
  license from one person to another? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison

  body: I think this mostly depends upon the software&#39;s EULA. Some foundries do
    allow transfer of the license, while others do not. I do know that Adobe software
    can be transferred, see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/salesdocs/1086a.htm"

    are fair game of course.

  body: 'In the US there&#39;s also the doctrine of &#34;first sale&#34;, which says
    that once a particular copy of a work has been sold, the copyright holder no longer
    has the right to control distribution of that particular copy.  That is, the physical
    medium containing the copy.  This is a separate issue from transferring the license.
    <BR> <BR>A few years ago, Adobe lost a <a href="http://cryptome.org/softman-v-adobe.htm">case</a>
    in which it claimed that the EULA prevented a retailer from buying bundled applications
    and selling them individually.  The court held that although Adobe called the
    transfer a license, it was structured like a sale; and since the retailer did
    not assent to the EULA, they weren&#39;t bound by it. <BR> <BR>Okay, so what if
    the seller had assented to the EULA?  At the time the seller agreed to the EULA,
    he was granted a license to use the software &#40;or fonts, etc.&#41;.  &#40;Just
    as you, the buyer, would be granted a license when you agree.&#41; Obviously the
    seller can no longer continue to use or keep a copy if he choses to sell the media;
    but at that point, the seller may no longer be bound by the EULA. <BR> <BR>To
    put it another way: not all provisions of the EULA continue to apply after the
    seller reverts his asset.  Would a condition that restricted first sale rights
    continue to apply?  I don&#39;t know the answer, and I&#39;m not sure the answer
    is known, but there&#39;s an awful lot of used software for sale. <BR> <BR>Now
    suppose instead that the seller isn&#39;t offering to send you physical media,
    but, instead, a pile of bits.  Last fall EBay cancelled a listing where someone
    was trying to sell bits he got from iTunes.  Unless the bits were public domain
    or the license allowed this, I don&#39;t see how such a sale could be legal. <BR>
    <BR>This is all assuming that shrinkwrap licenses are valid, which is unclear.  And
    legal does not mean ethical.  And I am not a lawyer; this is not legal advice;
    and it&#39;s probably all wrong anyway.'

    but I also wanted to know what my options are. I suppose when in doubt, ask the
    software company. <BR> <BR>-Addison

  body: One thing to keep in mind about buying software on E&#42;Bay is that there&#39;s
    a lot of piracy there. If you see somebody advertising Photoshop 7 for $50, then
    you should assume there&#39;s something wrong. Most commonly, it&#39;s either
    a pirated copy in the first place, or unregisterable because the person upgraded
    to the next version, and is &#40;illegally&#41; selling their previous version.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t mean to tar all E&#42;Bay software sales with that brush;
    there are plenty of good deals on old versions of software there. But sometimes,
    perhaps often, if the price seems just too good to be true, it is indeed too good
    to be true. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    bring up is very interesting. i&#39;m going to have to do a little digging. i
    never thought i&#39;d say this, but is there such a thing as a creative copyright
    phd? if someone has done something like this i&#39;d love to read their dissertation. '

  body: Actually there are plenty of stores popping up online selling many major software
    company products some in packaging and some for instant download. <BR> <BR>They
    claim to be fully legal and I assume they&#39;re operating under the premise that
    the manufacturers are aware of their stores or have appropraite licensing to resell
    older versions of software. <BR> <BR>Can we assume once a newer version is released
    the software company no longer cares about selling off its remaining inventory
    of &#39;old&#39; software or allowing resellers to offer it at deeply discounted
    prices with their knowledge? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll hunt down some sites . . . <BR>

    Adobe&#39;s corporate opinions are on retailers selling old versions of apps.
    I&#39;m sure many of these online retailers are legal, and I know that some of
    them aren&#39;t. <BR> <BR>T
