  body: Antonio was so close. This is the upright version of Deftone Stylus - called
    <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/dyspepsia/' target='_blank'>Dyspepsia</a>.
    Use the lowercase 's' to start, greatly decrease tracking, add lots of stroke
    weight and, er, good luck <em>exactly</em> recreating this.
