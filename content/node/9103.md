body: Hi everyone  <BR> <BR>I made a family of fonts using fontlab 4.6 in MacOSX,
  including light, book, medium, bold and black weights and exported a Mac T1 suitcase.  <BR>
  <BR>The font files are ok, except by the fact that when I type something in InDesign
  with the black weight, for example, and then change the weight to light, the text
  box moves a little bit upward. I&#39;ve checked the ascendents and descendents of
  all weights and they are the same, and I&#39;ve checked in other existing fonts
  that this doesn&#39;t happen. What&#39;s possibly happening?  <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: There are several optopns for the vertical relationship of the first line
    of text to the top of a text box in InDesign. This can be set in <i>Object / Text
    Frame Options.</i> I believe the default is &#39;Ascent&#39;. In any case, if
    there is even a small difference between the ascender, cap-height or x-height
    of two fonts, you will see different alignment if any of these options is selected.
    My recommendation is to use a leading or fixed value.

  body: Fernando,  <BR> <BR>in FontLab, go to Preferences / Type 1, deactivate &#34;Use
    WinAscent and WinDescent as font vertical size&#34; and generate the fonts. Please
    let me know if that helped.  <BR> <BR>Adam

  body: Maybe it&#39;s an Indesign problem, because I&#39;ve tested the font in many
    other applications, including Illustrator and Photoshop, and in these applications
    it doesn&#39;t happen.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tried to change the text frame options
    too, but it didn&#39;t help. <BR> <BR>I also saw that a few existing fonts have
    the same problem, like Linotype Univers.
