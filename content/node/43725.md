    a single dime on fonts?\r\n\r\nFor what it\u2019s worth: if you, Jackie, do so,
    make sure you don\u2019t violate anybody\u2019s rights, to take your time and
    design a decent version that people will gladly pay for, and to include all the
    original ligatures and alternates (at least)."

    site, and persuade my client to buy them! And freefonts are always welcome. I
    will not use the freefont in my designs (I can make my own). Some good scripts
    out there get to be bought!\r\nRight?"
