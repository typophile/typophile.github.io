  body: Seems good, but the letter i is kind of disconnected to the other letters,
    like a bar | instead  of an lowercase i. The c uper end is to curved compared
    to the lower end and the lower end could be extended a little. I think the o could
    be a little more rounded, more like the original sketch of the logo.

  body: "Top version looks like a tweak of <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/sansation.font\">Sansantion</a>.\r\n\r\nGenerally
    speaking, a critique requires knowing what this logo is for exactly. Fancy /C/
    might work for one case, but would create an absolutely inappropriate vibe for
    another. Though I suspect you know that."

    these letters\r\n\r\n*actually I didn't tweak or inspired by sansation. I followed
    my sketch and my eyes. Maybe there is sansation in my subconscious mind.\r\n"

  body: "Don't like the last version at all. It's out of style and I also think you
    should keep things simple.\r\n\r\nWhat's the name? it semiotics, itsemiotics,
    or semiotics? If you have the choice choose the latter, it's complex enough. Or
    maybe go for semiotics with an pay off talking about it.\r\n\r\nI kind of mis
    a sharp curve in the s like you have in your e.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could also tuck
    the tip of the c a bit to the left.\r\n\r\nI like the overal feel. :)"

  body: "You probably need to resolve exactly how someone should read this. I had
    a bit of a time parsing the letters into something pronounceable. If I.T. is an
    acronym for information technology, then maybe distinguish it a bit more. I am
    not too familiar with that field, but the name doesn't immediately sound like
    a brand - more like the name of a sector of that industry. \r\n\r\n/c/ feels too
    wide - maybe try something more like your original sketch.\r\nThe latest /o/ is
    nicely improved.\r\nThe thinking behind the latest changes to /it/ is good but
    the execution doesn't work.\r\n/s/ leans backward and feels a bit too imprecise
    for what I am inferring that you are trying to communicate."

  body: The flag makes me think of golf. Is it meant to be a play icon? Maybe try
    your old /m/ in there too? The initial /it/ seems too dark almost becoming an
    icon.

    name: manyaldesign
  body: It was not meant for an icon, the company name is itsemiotics and I tried
    to create some contrast between it and semiotics. for Luma, what  I do to make
    it less dark? less bold?

  body: "What I meant was that /it/ is becoming a little abstracted from letters.
    It is moving toward becoming a symbol, something like \u03C0. The boldness, ligature,
    and flag contribute to that. Whether this is a good thing or not is a question
    you will have to answer yourself, but I was assuming based on your initial sketches
    that it should be read as a phrase: \"I.T. Semiotics\"."
