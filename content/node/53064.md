  Berlin</a> (May 21\u201323)? I saw Nick Shinn will be speaking. Any other Typophiles
  attending? (If you register TODAY you will probably still get the early booking
  rate. Yes, I know, it's kind of late to state this now.)\r\n\r\nI registered a few
  days ago, after realizing I can get the student rate :-). I've been there twice
  before (2004, 2006) and it was always great input. Would be wicked to meet some
  Typophiles there!"

  body: Yeah, it's probably kind of early to ask :). It just struck me today that
    the early booking is closing. Well the "very early booking" is; they also have
    somewhat discounted rates through the end of February.

  body: "Yes, I'm really excited to be speaking at such a big conference, and in Berlin,
    which I've never visited.\r\nI originally intended to speak about space in a two-dimensional
    typographic sense, but then discovered the conference is about the third dimension.\r\nI
    suppose I could address the topic of 3D type, but have decided to tackle something
    not related to type at all. \r\nTBA. "

    that they appear to understand 'space' in a three-dimensional way. I'm curious
    to see what everyone will be speaking about.\r\n\r\nBTW, about their web site:
    What in the world is a 'faciliator'? Is that even a word?"

    of the theme. Sometimes it's great fun and pretty absurd ;-)

  body: I have to admit that I never pay much attention to the conference's theme.
    I know that the organizers try to really tie the theme into each conference, and
    they do a great job with every aspect of the organization. But for me, the conference
    is about the people. I can't remember the themes off the top of my head of the
    TYPO conferences that I've been to.

  body: Agree with your analysis of conference themes, Dan. Though "Music" definitely
    had some meaning 2 years ago with a lot of interesting connections between design
    and music.

  body: "True that. I did enjoy the music, especially the Wolfraam performance. But
    the House Industries set was not so different from their 2004 TYPO appearance.
    I would have been disappointed, but I wasn't because I think that \"Suburban Curse\"
    is one of the best songs ever.\r\n\r\nAside from the TYPO Music night, most of
    my favorite talks had nothing to do with music. But I am a type designer nerd,
    and I guess I am in the minority of attendees to a more general-themed graphic
    design conference. Although, I did enjoy the music angle that you and Yves brought
    into your presentation."
