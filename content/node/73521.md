body: "Hello all knowledgeable ones,\r\n\r\nI need help with feature markings in a
  RTL (Syriac) font which utilizes the mark and mkmk features. I have worked making
  Latin fonts with many open type features so I am familiar with how to write other
  open type code.\r\n\r\n I am using a Mac and have FL 4.6 and have access to FL 5
  Studio. This font will be used in the software Mellel. I have downloaded the correct
  keyboard and other RTL fonts have worked correctly.\r\n\r\nI decided to do this
  in stages to help pinpoint any errors. So far I have marked all the base glyphs
  with their anchor markings and checked them in the preview in FL. I saved the features
  file in FL. Then in the demo version of Fontographer 5 I opened the FL .vfb file
  and did all the linking (to the feature file) needed to process the open type file.
  No errors were reported but when I viewed in the Mellel it didn\u2019t link the
  position of the mark to the base glyph. \r\n \r\nObviously I am missing something.
  Any help will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nFrances\r\n"

  body: "Hello again,\r\n\r\nRegarding my issues (above post) with adding \u201Cmark\u201D
    features to the Syriac font. I just noticed something when I open the OpenType
    (not the .vfb) file in Fontlab that I processed in the Demo Fontographer 5. The
    \u201Cmark\u201D feature that I had added doesn\u2019t show up. Is that normal
    or is there something I missed when processing the features in Demo Fontographer
    5? When I open up any other OpenType file in FL it always shows features that
    have been made.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n"

  body: "Yes I understand FLS5 doesn\u2019t support mark or mkmk features. From another
    inquiry I posted last week about using ADFKO Adam Twardoch wrote that in Fontographer
    5 I could open my FL .vfb file point to AFDKO 2.5 feature definition file and
    generate my .otf. This is what I did and it didn\u2019t work. Is it possible that
    the demo version of Fontographer can\u2019t process this or am I missing a step?
    I feel that I have written the mark code correctly.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: "Hello Jens,\r\n\r\nWould you elaborate more on \u201Cgenerating the mark
    feature code from the anchor points\u201D please. Is this done in FL or Fontographer5?
    As far as I understood I just save the feature code file in FL (as it doesn\u2019t
    support the mark feature) bring that .vbf file into Fontographer and point to
    my feature file (a step in the generate font). It is something that probably is
    very obvious but somehow it doesn\u2019t click for me yet (this is my first time
    working with mark and mkmk code)\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\n--Frances\r\n"

  body: "The anchors you set in FontLab have no relevance to finished font. They are
    just used internally in FL to produce composite glyphs, and they don't automatically
    produce a \xBBmark\xAB feature when you save a feature file from FontLab. You
    have to write the mark feature code yourself. (You wouldn't even need to set FL
    anchors in order to do so, though it's easier to check the positioning of components
    when you have anchors and can preview the effect in the FL preview panel.)\r\n\r\nIf
    you have for example an anchor in the glyph \xBBA\xAB at position (365, 725) and
    an anchor on the glyph \xBBtildecomb\xAB at position (0, 500), the corresponding
    mark feature code could look like this:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfeature mark {\r\nmarkClass
    tildecomb  <anchor 0 500> @ANCHORS_top;\r\nposition base A  <anchor 365 725> mark
    @ANCHORS_top;\r\n} mark;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nWhen this code is in your OpenType
    panel, FontLab won't know what to do with it (pressing the compile button in FL
    will fail), but saving the complete feature code to a file and generating the
    font with Fontographer (or use the command-line tool <em>makeotf</em> from the
    Adobe FDK 2.5 directly) should work. (I don't have Fontographer to check it).\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps!\r\nJens"

  body: "Hi Jens,\r\n\r\nI think I have done the marking correct but in a little different
    way:\r\n\r\nThis is for the mark U0308 which coordinates are 125, 0 and I named
    the anchor \u201C_top mark0.\u201D (From what I\u2019ve read it can be written
    either with the coordinates or name.)  I have it anchored to the base glyph U0712
    at coordinate 305, 406\r\n\r\nfeature mark { # Mark Positioning\r\n script syrc;
    # Syriac\r\nlookupflag RightToLeft;\r\n#\tmark U0308 125 0;\r\n#\tpos U0712 mark
    U0308 305 406;\r\n}  mark;\r\n \r\n\r\nI do understand what FL\u2019s limitations
    are regarding processing the mark and mkmk features. I haven\u2019t tried the
    AFDKO 2.5 outside of FL as it seems a little intimidating but if I can figure
    out command line maybe it will work better. \r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nFrances\r\n"

  body: "Hrmpf, my mark code didn't go through correctly, the coordinates got lost,
    I'll try again:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfeature mark {\r\nmarkClass tildecomb &lt;anchor
    0 500&gt; @ANCHORS_top;\r\nposition base A &lt;anchor 365 725&gt; mark @ANCHORS_top;\r\n}
    mark;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nI think you need both, the coordinates (to define how
    the marks should be positioned) and a group name (to define which mark can be
    combined with which base glyph)."

    to check to see if anyone knows if Fontographer\u2019s demo version will generate
    the feature. It does generate the font but since it is only the demo version it
    is noted that some features may be disabled \u2013 which may mean that is why
    the combining marks are not linking.\r\n\r\nI do appreciate all your help. \r\n\r\n"

    not sure where there could be the error. I\u2019m also pretty sure I have written
    the correct code but the demo does say that it doesn\u2019t generate all the features
    and if one of those is the mark feature I can\u2019t check for sure."
