  gears running and work on all of those! <BR>I&#39;m planning a may release of this
  font, which is fully sketched but i wanted an opinion on the look &iquest;is it
  atractive and/or useful? This is one of my favourites but i&#39;m not sure about
  that name... <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/855.gif"
