  the <cite>Th</cite> ligature.\r\n\r\nIn Zeppelin the ligature works everywhere but
  the first word of the paragraph. If I change it to Walbaum the opening ligature
  is activated and the next in line separates.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone else would experiment
  a bit and see if they get similar results.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s and example.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zep_6221.gif]"

    thinking it is the justification settings. Doh!"

  body: "I don't remember the units that trigger it but, at some point, ligatures
    get abandoned in favor of the pair of letters they are derived from.  I wish there
    were some way to adjust your own threshold on an individual ligature basis.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Yeah, I noticed that too Chris. It seems to have something to do with tracking;
    once the typeface starts to look too openly spaced it knocks the ligature feature
    off, which is quite sensible I guess as ligated pairs would look too tight.\r\n\r\nIn
    the example above the top line especially looks more widely tracked than the bottom
    three lines.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "It is the tracking and justification settings working together.\r\n\r\nThe
    first thing I do is to track a font out to notice where the ligatures break. That
    helps me decide IF I want to use the ligatures.\r\n\r\nThe justification settings,
    which I have not finalized, added another layer of variance. When I hem in the
    letter spacing tolerance it comes back together and behaves.\r\n\r\nI have not
    set justified text in a long time. "
