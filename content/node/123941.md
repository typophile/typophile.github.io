body: Any  suggestions on a good display face to pair with Dante? (It's for a drop
  cap--Dante is too heavy.) Also, any suggestions about a good sans-serif pairing
  with Dante? (I recognize that there is a school of thought in which pairings should
  be similar, and another in which pairings should be dissimilar. Either kind of suggestion
  is welcome.)
