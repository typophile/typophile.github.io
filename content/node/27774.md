body: "This font has been bugging me since I first saw the new HP ads.  It feels very
  Tim Burtonesque, but after looking at the cover of \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\"
  that definitely isn't the font.  It may have been specially created for the campaign,
  but I really doubt it.  Identifont gave a few comparable fonts, but nothing really
  close and What the Font didn't really help either.  Any ideas?\r\nI zoomed in on
  the flash to grab this screenshot from:\r\nhttp://www.hp.com/personalagain/us/en/index.html[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hp-personalagain_4968.gif]"

  body: The name of the font embedded in the Flash files is <cite>HP PSG</cite>. I
    believe this stands for <cite>Hewlett-Packard Personal Systems Group</cite>; the
    name likely indicates that the font is custom.

  body: I didn't think to check the Flash for an embedded font. Since the personal
    systems group is all I come up with when searching for PSG within HPs website,
    I'm guessing you're right about it being custom face.  I like it when novelty
    fonts are readable and this one certainly is more streamlined than the 3 you posted...although
    who could resist a font with a name like "Uncle Stinky"? Thanks Spire.

  body: This is a proprietary font created by FontShop for <a href="http://gspsf.com">Goodby
    Silverstein</a> and HP. The typeface was inspired by the lettering of Jonathan
    Gray (AKA <a href="http://www.gray318.com/images/final%20jackets/large%20files/Extremely%20Loud.gif">Gray
    318</a>).

  body: "Those fonts are great Mike!  ...and thanks for the lead Stephen. I can now
    sleep at night.  Of course those eerie letterforms will still be dancing around
    in my dreams. After doing a little more searching for Jonathan Gray and the ad
    campaign I came across <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/artslife/story.html?id=e24a508b-ba93-47b5-bc2b-d2ed673e7d46\">a
    post about the new ad campaign</a> at canada.com.\r\nFrom the post:\r\n<dd>\"Noticed
    by at least a couple of bloggers, the similarities between the ads and the book
    covers are no coincidence -- well, almost.\r\n\r\nThe designer behind the font
    and the original hand happens to be another Jonathan -- Jonathan Gray, or Gray318,
    as is his moniker -- who, after being commissioned for both of the New York author's
    best-selling novels, was asked to do something similar for HP.\r\n\r\n\"We saw
    the books Jonathan designed and loved the typography for that,\" said Nancy Reyes
    of Goodby Silverstein & Partners, a San Francisco advertising agency contracted
    by HP.\r\n\r\n\"We weren't too concerned in terms of it looking similar to the
    book cover,\" she added. \"We were just happy it helped to inspire the campaign.\"\r\n\r\nDavid
    Roman, HP's marketing guru, says the design impressed him right away.\r\n\r\n\"It
    clicked immediately -- the style of design goes right back to that mid-20th century
    look that Saul Bass and Paul Rand popularized and I just liked that,\" he said.
    \"It was a little whimsical, definitely felt personal and we got a lot of positive
    feedback.\"</dd>\r\n"

    would have made it extra special. Maybe Goodby Silverstein, HP's agency, is a
