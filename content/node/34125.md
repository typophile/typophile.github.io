    recently (http://dezcom.com/), although for me it is still too alluringly teasing!
    Show us more, show us more! Chris'll take the font world by storm\u2026 just you
    wait. Hermann Zapf is 88 and still working. Chris has mad time ahead of him ;-)"

    a tease. I'm sure he'll be getting his site up soon. And I'm sure, more time to
    meet for lunch. ;)"

    and staying away from Typophile. As for his designs, he must be the old guy who
    stole our best ideas. ;-)\r\n\r\nAnyway congrats from Redmond. "
