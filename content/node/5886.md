    a form by hand. To my surprise I used Small Caps. I guess I did it so people could
    actually read it. My lowercase handwriting seems to be a bit messy. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    caps mainly for subheadings.

    i use most of the time and my own formal hand that i use when i actually want
    people to read it. but mostly i think my scribbling are meant only for me, so
    it becomes a real scrawl, no fine typographic features to speak of.

  body: I&#39;ve written in small caps since I was but a young lad &#40;much to the
    dismay of my teachers&#41;. <BR> <BR>As a consequence, I never really perfected
    the art of fine cursive writing &#40;sure, I know how to do it, but practice is
    another matter&#41;.  And ligatures never come into the picture--when I actually
    write in lowercase, the result can only be described as an attempt at cursive
    with absolutely no connections between the letters. <BR> <BR>I like the signature
    sample and panagram idea, but it could get a bit cumbersome couldn&#39;t it?

    cursive: i can write Russian in a very nice cursive, better than i can write block
    letters, but for English it&#39;s the other way around, i can&#39;t write in English
    in cursive without a lot of hesitation, which defeats the purpose of writing in
    cursive in the first place.'

  body: True, Tiff -- I hadn&#39;t thought about that. <BR> <BR>Also, you might say
    that the &#34;ing&#34; ligature is actually a &#34;ting&#34; ligature where the
    t bar takes off the i dot, but then I&#39;m really spotty with i dots to begin
    with. But that &#34;ing&#34; shows up almost all the time in my handwriting.
