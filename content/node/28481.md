  body: "I dont think the other font comes with the connecting lines. I think you
    could simulate it with <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/fontpage.php?PChoSaI.html\">Cholla
    Sans Italic</a> and some widening.It has the right M and G, and no other obvious
    mismatches in letterforms, as far as I noted.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
