  body: "Looks a lot like Bank Gothic to me.\r\n\r\nIt's got a white stroke and manually
    shadowed.\r\n\r\n*EDIT*\r\n\r\nNo, no white stroke. Three layers of the same font,
    the middle one is white."

  body: "My first inclination was Bank Gothic, but it didn't seem to fit quite right,
    even after some minor fiddling. Coming back and looking at it fresh today, it
    definitely appears to be Bank Gothic with some horizontal stretching.\r\n\r\nThanks
    all!"
