  looks like it might not be a font. Can someone please help me identify whether it
  is a font or if it is a 'photoshop'. If it is a font could someone please help me
  identify it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_4720.jpg] [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5857.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThankyou.\r\nRyan.\r\n\r\n"
