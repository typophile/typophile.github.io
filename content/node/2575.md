  body: I think it looks like a Clarendon/Egyptian slab serif that has been slanted.
    It is not an italic face. Monotype <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205343"
    target="_blank">Ionic Bold</a> seems to have a similar amount of contrast. I have
    the font and will try it to replroduce this sample.

  body: Well, it&#39;s not Ionic Bold! Try as I might I can only get close with various
    font mangling techniques. The font has to have a more closed C. but I think the
    technique was right. &#40;Ionic is the bottom one&#41;. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23333.gif"

  body: I was fooling around with Photoshop, trying out various Century variations,
    applying strokes etc. <BR> <BR>When I tried to match my creations on the top of
    the original &#34;Concorde&#34;, I noticed some strange irregularity. <BR> <BR>Finally
    I decided to skew the sample straight &#40;straight &#34;r&#34; and &#34;d&#34;&#41;
    to really see what was going on and this is the result. The original sample is
    also distorted quite a bit &#40;looks almost like every character was rotated
    separately, maybe it&#39;s an italic after all?:-o&#41;, It&#39;s difficult to
    say why because we don&#39;t have any info where the sample is from. <BR> <BR>Yves,
    I thik it might still be some version of Century, like Expanded Bold &#40;it has
    a different r&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23345.gif"

  body: OK, I tried the various Centurys that I have. The C serif isn&#39;t the same,
    but I think you can see that something like this was used.  I did what I did with
    the Ionic sample, which I think is where Jan was going too. It&#39;s not the italic
    face of any font, I am convinced. Century Schoolbook Bold looks the closest to
    me, but I think some other Century version will be the answer, like Madison or
    some odd foundry&#39;s version. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23368.gif"

  body: I think it&#39;s fairly clear that this was a custom lettering job.  <BR>The
    letterforms have typical modern characteristics, but I  <BR>doubt you will find
    an exact match among existing fonts.  <BR> <BR>The distortions you&#39;re seeing
    have to do with the fact that it  <BR>was drawn as an italic, not simply slanted
    from upright  <BR>artwork. When you slant ovals, you get an unnatural looking  <BR>south-west
    to north-east diagonal stress. Correctly drawn  <BR>italics are designed to compensate
    for this distortion. &#40;You  <BR>can see the compenstaion if you back-slant
    them to  <BR>upright.&#41; In this case, there appears to be a bit of over- <BR>compensation.

    two catalogues from the seventies. I have no <BR>idea to the print-production
