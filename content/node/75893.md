body: "i came across a poster on the tube (london underground) about a year ago for
  an exhibition at the hayward gallery and was struck by the typeface used.\r\n\r\nhttp://storage.canalblog.com/26/82/119589/41008435.jpg\r\n\r\nearlier
  today i found a similar typeface used within a young designers portfolio and it
  re-awakened my curiosity.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/revolver_type_5419.jpg]\r\n\r\non
  review, they are two different typefaces - though it is not easy to see on the example
  i have found online, the hayward gallery face has and angled terminal on the top
  of the lowercase t, where as the revolver face has a horizontal terminal. \r\n\r\nhelp
  identifying either one would be very appreciated. "

  body: "you've hit them both on the head!\r\n\r\ni took some detailed pictures of
    the hayward poster on my phone, and have just compared them to akkurat bold -
    there is a slight difference in the weight (which i think has been achieved by
    adding an outline to the text) but they are definitely the same typeface.\r\n\r\nthank
    you so much for your help!\r\n\r\nhank"
