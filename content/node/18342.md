  body: I'm interested in this topic too and I was going to ask for advice in this
    forum. I'm not looking for a list of type combinations but rather for guidelines.
    On what base do you choose typefaces to mix? Thanks in advance

  body: "Thank you for your hint Paul. Might be my next investment.\r\n\r\nI don't
    really know which books you call standard. I am a bit knew into typography and
    haven't read so much yet. The list of books that I want to buy is growing every
    day but i actually didn't have the money to buy them.\r\n\r\nI have read a few
    books that might be standard but I don't really know. Maybe the people who recommended
    them to me didn't know better books!?!?\r\n\r\nFor example some of the english
    books which I liked was:\r\n\u2022 The logo font and lettering bible by Leslie
    Cabarga\r\n\u2022 The Stroke. The Theory of Writing by Gerrit Noordzij (still
    reading)\r\n\r\nMost of the books I have read were german books and I didn't find
    the english names of it.\r\nSome books from Frutiger, Tschichold, Spiekerman,
    Willberg, Friedl etc.\r\n\r\nWhich books could you also suggest me?\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings: Steven"

  body: "Steven, all of those books you just mentioned are great. Read them and then
    read them again. Don't forget to question them, or at least notice when they start
    to question each other (Willberg vs. Otl Aicher, for instance, in <em>Typolemik/Typophil</em>).\r\n\r\nWe
    have a collection of three \"must reads\" here that we call the [[Triumvirate]].
    All of them are good, and Paul just mentioned one (<em>The Elements of Typographic
    Style</em>). The Triumvirate is more a recommendation for how to make type and/or
    use it well, not necessarily on how to mix it. \r\n\r\nA good basic primer on
    type styles and how to mix them is a book by Erik Spiekermann, which you can read
    either in English (<em>Stop Stealing Sheep and find out how type works</em>) or
    in German (<em>\xDCberSchrift</em>)."

    bought, quickly followed by <em>Elements</em>, Friedl's <em>Typography</em> tome
    (which technically was a gift, not a purchase), and Tschichold's <em>Die Neue
    Typographie</em>, in the English translation, though.\r\n\r\nThe last book on
    typography that I have purchased to date was <em>Arabic Typography</em>, by Huda
    AbiFares. But I've received several books as gifts since. I have no idea what
    the next book I buy will be, but I'm already looking forward to it, whatever it
    is ;-)"

    \r\nISBN: 0891345183\r\n\r\nI found this on Amazon. I haven't read it so I can't

  body: The more I think about this question -- not that it occupies every waking
    moment -- I have to suggest you do something else. Instead of relying on one author's
    suggestions for good type combinations you could (should?) explore the books all
    around the bookstore. What strikes you as working? Find books that you perceive
    to have good type combinations. Using you own instinct, even if at first you rely
    upon what you think others are doing well, will give you much more interesting
    results than what you will find in one or two books which will probably only show
    a small percentage of the type which is actually available for use.

    \r\n\r\napparently, the designer (his name escapes me, sorry!), starts off each
    issue with a unique type pallette. he likes to mix and match obscure typefaces
    that wouldn't normally be used together. the result, in combination with awesome
    graphic design, is very fresh.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\nnc"

  body: "Type mixing, like cooking or music, will never be an exhausted topic (I mean
    to say -- though you may get exhausted or bored to death, the subject itself will
    never run out).\r\n\r\nThere are fundamental principals, stylistic preferences,
    \"safe approaches\" and dangerous but exciting breaks from the norm.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    like learning to cook or playing music, the fundamentals will allow you to explore
    safely until you can build enough confidence to try something new with type.\r\n\r\nThe
    major difference over the last ten years or so, is that exploring different type
    combinations is easier especially if the fonts are already part of your library.
    Switching types is now a simple menu option on Macs/PCs and not an expensive experiment
    like buying type output from the old typeshops of yore.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have
    the typeface you are interested in using, try to find a pdf sample of text from
    one of the type vendor sites. Print it out and literally cut & paste the (1200
    dpi+) output next to other blocks of faces you are considering. Like cooking...
    add an ingredient or spice sparingly at first... sample it, then season to taste.\r\n\r\nA
    good meal is a good meal -- but creating a great meal is something we all would
    love experiencing. (Gee, I've been on Weight-Watchers for two months now... I
    wonder if it has affected my thinking?)\r\n\r\nBTW -- Type mixing could be one
    of several topics to explore during TypeCon's Type Education sessions."
