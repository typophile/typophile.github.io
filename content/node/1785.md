  trying to make the best of it.&#41; Is anyone else here at the conference? <BR>
  <BR>I attended a seminar on OpenType by two Adobe Toronto guys. They were good at
  their jobs, which was clearly to be cheerleaders for the CS suite -- showing off
  the admittedly dazzling combo of InDesign and OpenType Pro fonts. Two peeves, however:
  <BR> <BR>1&#41; They started off with a general presentation &#40;done in Acrobat&#41;
  in which all the quotation marks were actually inch marks. Way to boost your credibility,
  guys.  <BR> <BR>2&#41; During Q&amp;A, they pretty much tap-danced around anything
  potentially negative about the new Creative Suite model. I realize their job is
  to evangelize, but when you can&#39;t even get a straight answer out of them I don&#39;t
  think it helps Adobe any. F&#39;rinstance, I asked about the <i>next</i> round of
  upgrades: if you purchase the Suite now, are you locked into always upgrading the
  whole Suite rather than individual apps? Their answer boiled down to, &#34;Yes,
  because that&#39;s the way you want it, and you&#39;d be a dolt to want anything
  else.&#34; Sigh. Someone else asked about the &#40;current&#41; Photoshop-owner
  upgrade, and whether there were better upgrade options for people who own more than
  one Adobe app. Again, their answer was basically, &#34;But why would you want such
  a crazy thing?&#34; The guy who asked the question actually had to follow up with:
  &#34;So... are you saying no?&#34;  <BR> <BR>I know it&#39;s hard to be in the position
  of marketing something that&#39;s problematic. But maybe they could take a page
  from Tim Cole, who&#39;s the only evangelist-type I&#39;ve ever heard actually give
  straight, no-nonsense answers. It sure made one want to hear and believe what he
  had to say. Speaking Marketese doesn&#39;t fool anyone. <BR> <BR>IMHO, of course.'

    than others. Not to dismiss an admirable goal, but it reminds me of the &#34;First

  body: I consider Mercury to have two kinds of wedge serifs. The fact that some of
    the serifs are adnate and some are not is the only remarkable thing about the
    design. The fact that a and s have different kinds of terminals from everything
    else is not unusual; these letters are often exceptional because their terminals
    are not strictly speaking serifs. The fact that some letters have ball terminals
    is also not unusual &#40;see Fenway, Arnhem, Paradox, to name just a few recent
    designs&#41;. So let&#39;s focus on the adnate vs. non adnate wedges, considering
    the uppercase L. This is a letter in which the terminal needs to be heavier than
    a typical serif, both because it is vertical and because it is so far distant
    from the main stem, connected only by a thin stroke. The connection of the terminal
    to that thin stroke benefits from being strengthened, hence the adnate connection,
    which adds weight and makes the terminal a terminal, <i>i.e.</i> something that
    belongs to the stroke, and not merely something stuck on the end. For comparison,
    take a look at how Matthew Carter solves the same problem in a different way in
    Fenway. <BR> <BR>[PS. Shouldn&#39;t this be a separate thread?]

    etc. <BR> <BR>&#62; Carter solves the same problem in a different way in Fenway.

    at least a justification that puts them squarely within the bounds of not only
    acceptable but even normal practice. Maybe your view of what is orthodox is simply
    too limited? <BR> <BR>I have not looked closely at the new Fenway cut, but I&#39;ve
    looked very closely at the original, having used it in <i>Language Culture Type</i>
    and all the ATypI Vancouver material. Take a look at the L and see how Matthew
    maintains the regularity of his abrupt serif connection but at the same time links
    the wedge to the stroke. He is solving the same problem that Jonathan is solving
    in a different way. I don&#39;t have a problem with either solution, and if anything
    Jonathan&#39;s is the more orthodox and less innovative.

    has a logic all its own, none of which is similar to the serif-like terminal on
    the &#39;s&#39;. And what about that &#39;a&#39; tail compared to the rest of
    the foot serifs or the &#39;d&#39; tail serif? Plus, of course, the broad triangular
    head serifs compared with the thin foot serifs. <BR> <BR>Or what about Monticello:

    going on with that &#39;s&#39; terminal. And I didn&#39;t bother to show the huge,
    broadly bracketed serifs of the caps. How did Binny &#40;and Griffith/Larson and

    contrast is another&#39;s discord. I&#39;m not surprised to see this in Mercury,
    as it was inspired by Fleischmann and this kind of extreme combination of contrasting
    elements was part of the zeitgeist of the late Baroque period.  <BR> <BR>Speaking

    sessions &#40;and 6AM yoga&#41; due to, shall we say, a rather zealous dedication
    to after hours socializing. <BR> <BR>All in all the conference was an inspiring
    and worthwhile experience, and one which I would recommend. If you did the math
    in paragraph one, you&#39;ll know that I attended about 24 lectures. What is remarkable
    is that of them only one, Jonathon Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones, showed any
    actual work. To many this was a disappointment, but I found it uniquely envigorating
    to hear designers really TALK for a change. Yes, a little show and tell could
    have gone a long way, but after such a drought of discussion of ideas, the change
    was welcome.  <BR> <BR>Incidentally, misters Hoefler and Frere-Jones, positively
    awed the audience with the rigor of their craft. <BR> <BR>Of course the greatest
    value of the conference &#40;besides Lucille singing kareoke&#41; was meeting
    so many interesting new people, reunited with old friends and deepening relationships
    with heretofor casual acquaintances. It was in these exchanges I took comfort
    in knowing that there are others out there who care as much as I - miraculously
    about the same issues. <BR> <BR>As far as any new direction is concerned for the
    AIGA, that&#39;s tough to say. It has a diverse constituency and I think it is
    therefore difficult to make such generalizations, no matter how dearly some might
    wish to. I do think, however, that change will be manifest in two deomgraphics:
    region and age. Regional attitudes towards design, business and culture &#40;and
    the degree to which they can be seen as independent from one another&#41; are
    already becoming evident. This was clear from the presentations, but more notably
    from the sea of portfolios I reviewed. And age, well, there is a generation of
    50 and 60 somethings who have defined the profession in the modern era but who
    are now close to the end of their run. I think in large part it will be the generation
    of current 30-somethings &#40;many of whom work for or studied under the aforementioned&#41;
    who fill the inevitable void and lead design into new territories by their example.'

    new thread topic: Designers&#39; Theme Songs.&#41; <BR> <BR>Agreed that Hoefler
    &amp; F-J gave an excellent presentation -- inspirational.  <BR> <BR>I do hope
    you&#39;re right about the younger generation of designers. I&#39;ve sat through
    so many idealistic organizational &#34;revolutions&#34; that never came to anything,
    so I&#39;m perhaps unfairly cynical about it all. I did find some of the presentations
    really inspiring and exciting &#40;Fritjof Capra knocked my socks off, and Helfand
    &amp; Drenttel were pretty great&#41;, and have been thinking about practical
    changes I can make in my business.'
