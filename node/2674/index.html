		<div class="commentbody"><i>&hellip;would you have trouble equating Christians with Nazi's?</i> <BR> <BR>What do you mean? If you are pointing out that many people who considered themselves Christians joined the Nazi party and supported Hitler, obviously this is terribly true. If you are pointing to the contribution of 19 centuries of Christian antisemitism in European culture to the making the Holocaust possible, you will get no argument from me. However, if you are suggesting that the tenets of Christian belief and Nazi ideology are the same, then obviously this is not true. They are, at least, different, and most people would agree that they are plainly incompatible: you need to grossly distort one to arrive at the other. <BR> <BR>Also, I'm increasingly of the opinion that the term 'Christian' is close to meaningless today, and probably has been since long before even the rise of protestantism. There is no religion called Christianity, and the most that can be said is that the term recognises the central position of the figure of Christ in a great number of different religions that do not agree on who or what Christ was.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">BTW, William, you should know that a recent BBC survey (<i>slightly</i> more objective than some of your sources&hellip;) showed that there was greater support for Israel's &quot;policy&quot; towards the Palestinians than there is within Israel itself! Not even counting its 10% Arab population. What does that tell you? Or at least us, who are not encumbered by a legacy coping mechanism&hellip; <BR> <BR>You can pretend to be compassionate (or even merely pragmatic) as much as you want, but the fact on the ground is that the US (in its broader political presence of the House and Senate, even more than the White House) unwaveringly supports apartheid measures such as the limiting of marriages and the construction of artificial concrete borders*. Only the people already brainwashed are fooled. Claiming that popular opinion guides foreign (or even domestic) policy is part of the deception. So is the use of &quot;Democracy&quot; like a blunt weapon. But this two-faced approach will get you in the end. <BR> <BR>* Something you won't hear on CNN or Fox: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3334235.stm" target="_blank"><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3334235.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3334235.stm</a></a> <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

However, off the top of my head, I can think of at least a few sects who at least consider themselves nominal Christian that do not believe in the divinity of Christ and/or who believe Christ's sacrifice redeems us only of individual sin. <BR> <BR>My main point is that the term Christian doesn't refer to anything specific.

The idea that a religion is a set of beliefs reflects, in my opinion, a distinctly individualist, protestant interpretation: what a friend of mine &ndash; herself a protestant &ndash; calls 'head religion'. It ultimately leads people to think they can be religious without actually doing anything. Catholicism is emphatically a set of beliefs <i>and a set of actions,</i> both individual and communal, and this is also the impression I have of Judaism. There are things one should believe and there are things that one should do, and together they define the way one should live.</div>

First, you say that Israeli Jews are more sensible and less 'fundamentalistical' than American Jews, and then you cite a BBC story about public opinion of world leaders in which only Israelis trust George Bush above other leaders. Seriously confusing. Take your time.</div>

But now we should pay attention to surveys of Europeans and Africans? Even when the results are based on 'desperation for fair payback' and 'feeling' and not, say, on a knowledgeable consideration of the situation in the Middle East? <BR> <BR>Citing surveys of people who agree with you doesn't actually make you right.

What's hoaky about the search term 'Jewish survey'? You may not believe that William is dumb, but apparently you think all the other readers of this thread are.

The then Prime Minister Jean Cretien had just issued a scathing lecture to these countries on human rights abuse. CBC interviewed one Central American representatives directly afterwards asking for reflections on the human rights lecture.

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, as I said: 'It is fair and accurate to observe that some states that affect to guarantee freedom of speech also impose limits on that freedom'. I'm not debating whether freedom of speech is illusory, I'm saying that it is disingenuous to use the service policies of a company like eBay as evidence of a lack of freedom of speech <i>because such policies are under no obligation to provide freedom of speech.</i> When peaceful protesting students at UBC are pepper-sprayed by RCMP officers reporting directedly to the Prime Minister's Office, it is an infringement of freedom of speech; when eBay says it won't allow you to sell SS memorabilia using its services, it is not. The government has an obligation under the constitution to provide a level of freedom of speech that includes peaceful protest. eBay is under no obligation to allow you to sell SS memorabilia.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, there are two things to take into account when comparing different democratic states: one is the mechanism of democracy employed and the other is the political culture of the society. Neither of these things can be considered in isolation, either from each other or from other factors, including external factors, but together they provide a basic understanding of the differences between, say, Canada and Finland. Only some of these differences can be understood in terms of different democratic mechanisms (e.g. first-past-the-post vs. proportional representation); in order to 'accumulate an unimaginable variation of different ideals' you need a political culture that encourages such diversity as well as the mechanism to give voice to it. It also helps to be a relatively small country in which ideas are a greater factor in everyday political discourse than geography and regionalism. <BR> <BR>Bearing these two things (democratic mechanisms and political culture) in mind, let me answer your question: <i>Is Israel a democracy John?</i> <BR> <BR>Yes, Israel is a democracy, and in purely mechanical terms, it is much more like Finland than like Canada. Indeed, one can easily argue that proportional representation, which in the Finnish political culture reflects a diversity of ideals, is one of the factors contributing to what you object to about Israeli government policy. For example, extremist settler groups can find a voice in parliament as a result of proportional representation, and can influence voting blocks on issues affecting the occupied territories. At the same time, Israel manages its own 'unimaginable variation of different ideals' &ndash; especially unimaginable to those who see Israel only in terms of the Palestinian conflict &ndash;, including a very significant peace movement and a democratic judiciary that has been effectively utilised by human rights organisations representing Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories. Considering the particular political culture &ndash; and the external factors that contribute to it &ndash; that resulted in the election of Ariel Sharon, you might pause to consider what kind of country Finland would be if it had spent the past 50 years in near-continuous conflict with belligerent neighbours.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, if 'Israel is a democracy for Jews only' how come they have representatives of Arab political parties sitting in their parliament? How come they have an Arab judge sitting on their High Court? How come my Arab Israeli friends are able to vote in Israeli elections? How come my Arab Israeli friends would rather be citizens of Israel than of, say, Syria, or even Jordan or Egypt? <BR> <BR>Understand, I'm not saying that Israeli democracy is anything like perfect, or that the legal position of Arab Israelis can't be significantly improved (not least by prohibiting private discrimination against them by employers, etc.). But it is a calumny to say that Israel is a democracy only for Jews. <BR> <BR>It is also a calumny to accuse the Israelis of genocide: a calumny against both the Israelis and the Palestinian fighters. When much of the world's media was swallowing the lie that Israeli troops had deliberately massacered civilians in Jenin (a lie that still gets repeated, despite even the report of <i>Palestinian</i> doctors in Jenin that the massacre never took place), the Palestinian Authority was declaring a military victory in Jenin because 15 Israeli soldiers had been killed in the <i>battle.</i> If the Israelis wanted to practice genocide, this whole conflict would be over in a matter of minutes. Instead, Israel puts its soldiers at risk conducting infantry searches for armed militants who have declared themselves to be dedicated to the destruction of Israel &ndash; not to peace, not to human rights, not to a separate Palestinian state: 'Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it' (Hassan al-Banna quoted in the Hamas Covenant) &ndash;; if it were interested in genocide, Israel could level entire towns with missiles without any risk to its own soldiers. As I've said in the past, much of Israel's actions in the occupied territories are immoral and illegal &ndash; including the crime of turning off the water supply to Jenin during the incursion &ndash;, but calling it 'genocide' is unsupportable by the evidence of either the method or the result.</div>

But the majority of propaganda I see favours the Palestinian cause and regularly misrepresents both Israel and the Palestinian militant organisations. This is true of much of the reports from Reuters, Associated Press, BBC and other wire services and frequently cited news sources. Reuters, for example, regularly refers to Hamas as an organisation 'fighting for a Palestinian state', while failing to report that this (Islamic theocratic, non-democratic) state is intended to occupy the entire territory of Israel. <i>This</i> propaganda juggernaut has completely distorted the history of the Arab Israeli conflict, and it has been swallowed whole by a depressingly large number of presumably well-meaning, liberal people in Europe and North America. And then there is the anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish propaganda in the Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority. I have a very good friend who lives in Cairo, who reports that most of the Egyptian population believes that 'the Jews' were responsible for the attack on the World Trade Centre and offers as 'evidence' the 'fact' reported in Egyptian newspapers that no Jews showed up for work at the WTC that morning. And this is in an Arab country that has a peace treaty with Israel, so one can only imagine what the Syrians, Saudis, etc. are being told by their governments. <BR> <BR>Rather than 'listening to the world', why not try being committed to the truth? There's plenty of propaganda from both sides to sift through, without adding to it by making inapplicable and insupportable accusations of genocide and racism.</div>

Ironic, well know anti-semite <i>Henry Ford</i> said, &quot;You can have any colour you like as long as you like black.&quot; <BR> <BR>This is a clear case of <i>Ethnoism</i> which is more pernicious than <i>Racism.</i> This contradicts <i>Common Law Inclusion</i> of a <i>Right of Return</i> immigration policy. Therefore, it is misleading. Which, I assume, explains your confusion.  It could have been written <i>Every Jewish person has a right to immigrate to Israel, the rest of you, we don't care if your ancestor was Jesus Christ, bug off.</i> What do you think? Just a suggestion. <BR> <BR>By the way William, your words in italic. <BR> <BR><i>A person who converts is a full Jew, including the right of return. This demonstrates that Judaism is not a race as defined traditionally or by the state of Israel.</i> <BR> <BR>I am not sure if this is in affect, but I believe the law is changed, or in the process, that Jewish converts will not be so allowed <i>Right of Return.</i> <BR> <BR><b>NOTES:</b> <BR> <BR>1.) I accept a nation has a right to draft their own immigration policy, racist, ethnoist or not. <BR> <BR></div>
