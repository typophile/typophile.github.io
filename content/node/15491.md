  thus far in isolation from type fiends, and getting most of my typographical education
  from books, I'm stuck on a few names that I just have no idea which way to pronounce.
  \ Help a brother out?\r\n\r\nThe ones I'm confused on are:\r\nFrutiger\r\nDeepdene\r\nGaramond\r\nTschichold\r\n\r\nI'm
  sure there are others, but for some reason I can't recall them off the top of my

    many pronounciation questions which come up.\r\n\r\nHere's my go at these.\r\n\r\nFrutiger
    - 'Froot-i-gehr'  (ehr = air) pronounced as in German, not French (not 'froot-i-zhay')\r\n\r\nDeepdene
    \ 'deep - deen'\r\n\r\nGaramond - in English 'Gair-uh-mond'; in french?\r\n\r\nTschichold
    \ 'Chih - chold' first chi as in chick second ch is as in JS Bach. That's German.
    Alternate for English makes the second ch an english 'sh' chih - shold. \r\n\r\nHow
    am I doing? Please correct.  "

    here, otherwhise i'd record it so you could listen (im swiss, thus having no problem
    pronouncing swiss names :))\r\n\r\n- the fru in frutiger could be pronounced like
    the beginning of (japanese) \"fujiama\" or something, just with an r in between.
    frujiama.. :D \r\nthen, \"tiger\" isnt pronounced like the animal, but:\r\n- the
    \"t\" like in semanTics (a strong t)\r\n- iger probably like \"digger\", but without
    the double g.. so less strong g..\r\n\r\ngaramond in french would be gar like
    in \"garanty\" but the a like in car, then again an a like in car. in \"mond\",
    you wont pronounce the \"d\", so probably the mon in \"monthly\" would fit, but
    stretch the \"on\" ALOT. on probably makes about a third of the length of the
    whole word when pronouncing..\r\n\r\nwhen i finally get a headset for using skype,
    i will make recordings of all the german and french names in typography (helvetica
    neue, univers, garamond, frutiger, tschichold, joseph m\xFCller-brockmann, etc..).\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    the D in tschichold will SURELY not be pronounced like a t, its a soft ending."

  body: "Thanks 'kesh'. \r\n\r\nOn how to do a non-English 'r' I just say forget about
    it, as it sounds too foreign in English. (Also the American r is different from
    the English r, and on top of that the English often drop the r entirely.)\r\n\r\nThis
    raises the whole issue of how accurate to a foreign language you should be in
    English. For example the English go for an English pronounciation of 'Quixote,'
    but Americans approximate the Spanish. English make a sort of pathetic stab at
    the French way of saying 'ant' in restaurant, whereas the Americans end it with
    an 'ont' as in 'font'.\r\n\r\nThanks on the d in Tshichold. \r\n\r\n'iger' in
    Frutiger cannot be like digger in German - or French - because the sound of er
    in father or digger doesn't exist in either German or French. \r\n\r\nOh, and
    on the ond in Garamond, if French drop the d they must nasalize with the distinctive
    french 'on', no? --so 'gah - rah - MON', with the nasalized 'on'\r\n\r\n"

  body: "yeah, the \"on\" is quite nasalized (does this word exist? :))\r\n\r\nthe
    \"iger\"/digger-thing is correct, believe me. swiss german is like very old german
    in many ways, and when speaking, we use LOTS of \xE4, \xF6 and \xFC, and mixed
    versions of \xE4e and so on - there's no correct way of writing swiss german,
    thus no correct way of speaking it. but a swiss person would pronounce the \"er\"
    in frutiger like \"\xE4r\" or sometimes \"\xF6r\" (corresponding to their accents
    of swiss german), as in digger.. (and after all, frutiger is a swiss, so using
    the swiss pronounciation is more correct than the \"high german\" (thats what
    we swiss call the \"german german\"))\r\n\r\nfor sure this is not exactly the
    same sound - but its pretty near. i will for sure upload samples of sounds when
    i get a headset in the next days.\r\n\r\n:)"

    for a 'typowiki' is to say what is wrong, and approximate what it can be in English.
    \r\n\r\nBy the way, listening to Jean Francois Porchez on Type Radio I learned
    that he pronounces the 'z', which I wouldn't have guessed. "

  body: "William, I meant that one should accomodate pronunciation depending on the
    \"target\". For example I will use the French pronunciation of \"Garamond\" when
    talking to a French person (I mean even when using English) but would not do that
    with somebody unfamiliar with French, because that would create a distortion (that
    of snobism, which isn't there in my case) in the communication. Unless I'm trying
    to intellectually intimidate a non-Frenchie, then the nasal action will come thick

    the question here is what pronounciation to use assuming that the listener doesn't
    know the native tongue of the person with the foreign name. Evidently, it is some
    kind of modified version of the foreign pronounciation.  "

    or <em>BEE-a-tris</em>?\r\n\r\nI never had the opportunity to meet Herb Lubalin.
    I had mostly heard it as <em>\"Loo-BAL-in\"</em>, but Ed Benguiat would always
    say <em>LOOB-a-lynn</em>... so I still don't know how Herb actually pronounced
    his name.\r\n\r\nFunny though, Ephram Benguiat always answers to <em>BEN-ghat</em>
    (like \"hat\"). But when we were on a speakers tour of Spain, they knew him well
    and treated him as a hero -- since in Spain his family name is moreno and is pronounced
    <em>Ben-gee-yaht</em> (\"gee\" with a hard \"g\").\r\n"
