body: "This sample was scanned from The Vampire Chronicles Collection by Anne Rice,
  particularly book three thereof, The Queen of the Damned. The other books in the
  Collection use Janson Text by Linotype. I recognize that this typeface has some
  immediately recognizable Janson features, but I am stumped as to what font it actually
  is. The uppercase Q is particularly confounding. The closest I have come is Berthold's
  Janson, but the lowercase e of that font is far too extended and, frankly, looks
  out of place and is downright ugly. Also included at the top center of the image
  is a sample of the italics. Does ANYONE here know what this font might be?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/QotD
