  body: 'Just a bit more information. I''m trying to design something different from
    the usual, boring outline-layout CV. Hence my two-column layout. (Of course I''m
    only aiming for something <i>slightly</i> different: philosophers are hardly a
    wild and wacky bunch). I''ve added a more standard-looking CV (that I typeset
    for a friend of mine) above for comparison.'

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nRegarding the length, academic CVs (at least in the Humanities)
    are generally several pages long, since they usually list all of one's publications
    and presentations. (This is one way in which they differ from r\xE9sum\xE9s.)
    Here, for instance, is <a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Esdarwall/Vitae.pdf\">the
    11-page CV</a> of one of the members of my dissertation committee."

  body: "Looks sharp. I've set my fair share of CVs for academics. Yours has a very
    bookish feel without seeming overly stylized. You've done very well.\r\n\r\nI
    might place less emphasis on the words \"Curriculum Vitae\" on page one, but that's
    really a minor matter.\r\n\r\nGood job."

  body: Bookish but not overly stylized? That's pretty much perfect. Thanks for the
    kind words!

    and the 'ae' ligature in the subtitle?\r\nboth are great, but together they look
    a little odd"

  body: Good job, but... As dropkick wrote, it looks like a book, a novel which tells
    a story continuously. Your CV needs to present the hierarchy better. You need
    more contrast. The reader must see the headlines and different parts fast. Try
    to use bold weight as well. Use your better two column layout blended with better
    hierarchy of your friend's Cv.

  body: "Given that it's for being on the academic market, I think it's fine -- and
    that the \xC6 adds a lot, it doesn't distract me at all (but then again, I use
    it too).\r\n\r\naszszelp, remember this is a CV, not a r\xE9sum\xE9, by definition
    it's supposed to include everything.  Plus, I'm assuming he's going for a tenure-track
    position so they're going to want to know everything before they invite him for
    an interview.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that bothers me is that since a lot of times
    degrees are placed in small caps, I initially thought you had your universities
    out of order, since your bachelors was done in Massachusets, and I saw in order:
    DPhil, BPhil, MA.  I saw Bachelor of Arts right under it but still, just thought
    I'd point that out.  The only real solution of course would be writing out the
    names which if you're going for the US market would be akward, but if it's int'l
    I'd go ahead and write it out fully.\r\n \r\nGiven that most CVs are done in Word
    and full of typographic horrors thanks to autocorrect (even though you'd think
    folks applying for teaching positions would know better), this one will stand
    out for sure.  (this is probably all preaching to the choir but just in case not)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "Thanks for the comments, Matthew. When you say I should write out the names,
    I assume you mean the geographical abbreviations (e.g., MA and UK). Is that correct?
    There is plenty of room for \"Michigan\" and \"Massachusetts,\" but \"United Kingdom\"
    would cause the Oxford entry to spill over onto the next line. I suppose I could
    use \"England\" instead.\r\n\r\nMost of the jobs I'll be applying for are in North
    American."
