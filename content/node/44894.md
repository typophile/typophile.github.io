  with a quick presentation.\r\nI'm a graphic design graduate. I'm cultivating my
  obsession with typography and I guess I've found here the best place to worsen my
  compulsion.\r\n\r\nI've been lurking for a while and I found this site an indispensable
  (and beautiful) resource.\r\n\r\nAsking mercy for my bad English and type terminology
  I'll go ahead with my first rant:\r\n\r\nI have been reading \"Musicophilia\" by
  Oliver Sacks for 5 weeks, I think it's  interesting and easy to follow book but
  I still stop reading when my eyes meet ligatures in the text particularly the \"fi\"
  glyph. Also footnotes are often spreading into multiple pages breaking my flow of
  thoughts.\r\n\r\nHere are some photos explaining what I'm talking about.\r\n\r\n\r\n

    I agree on the footnotes though, and in general it bugs me when they take up half
    the page. '

  body: The ligature problem may be related to your age. Ligatures were much more
    common when type was metal. Younger readers are probably less accustomed to them
    due to digital type and typesetters. As the quality of digital type increases,
    I'm hoping we can bring back ligatures so they aren't a distraction, but part
    of the natural text flow.

    read books with a distracting letter here or there that drove me crazy. As for
    the footnotes, are they especially important or enlightening? When the notes can
    really matter I like not having to flip to the back of the book to find them;
    I actually own multiple copies of some books so I can read it with or without
    the notes along the bottoms of the pages. "

  body: "Hello Stephen.\r\nI see what you're saying. The other ligatures don't bother
    me though, I just think that the f is a little too high with a thin terminal (is
    it the right term?) and a large stem. but maybe you're right: there aren't many
    ligatures around these days (above all on the web)!\r\n\r\nedit: here's an enlarged

  body: "It looks to me like this book is set in Trump Mediaeval. I actually agree
    that the f-ligatures in Trump Mediaeval are in fact a bit overbearing and can
    appear out of keeping with the rest of the face. Their presence in the font is
    curious to me, since it sets just fine without the ligatures; and in fact, this
    is one of those faces I prefer to use without them. (Aldus is another that gets
    along fine without ligatures.) Since f-ligatures are primarily a solution to prevent
    crashing forms, the use of them in situations where there is no crashing to begin
    with is debatable. \r\n\r\nRegarding extensive footnotes: One question would be
    whether the kind of thing shown occurs regularly or not. If, in general, the notes
    are modest, then treating them as footnotes is a reasonable proposition; and then
    if there are occasional situations where several stack up in close proximity or
    there are a few that are overly long, sometimes this sort of thing is unavoidable.
    It's certainly difficult to solve in design if editorial insists that they need
    to be as they are.\r\n\r\nIf this situation is more representative of the norm,
    then one could argue that they might have served better as endnotes.\r\n\r\nThe
    subject of how to handle scholarly notes -- whether they should be footnotes or
    endnotes, whether the noted material is germane or not, whether content belongs
    in-line or in a note -- all of this is quite a bit of fodder for the editorial
    folks, too, and not just a consternation for designers. This is one of those overlap
    areas between typography and editorial. In the end, the design must do the best
    it can to serve the material.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    notes occur every 10 pages average. And to me it feels like an editorial more

  body: "With notes, where they fall will always be a function of their editorial
    purpose and generally driven by the author. The challenge with several notes clumped
    together, or a long note, is to decide how to array them with the text. You have
    to try to balance the amount of note on the page with the amount of text. You
    want to avoid running a string of notes over a spread (or across a turn!) if that
    takes subsequent notes too far from their reference. But you also don't want to
    end up with a single page that has three lines of text and the rest notes, for
    example.\r\n\r\nSometimes you can even find yourself in the impossible situation
    where a note reference falls at such a point that keeping the whole note on the
    page actually pushes the reference to the next spread; but then pulling the reference
    back to the page means you have no room for the note. Things like that. In such
    a case, you go back to try to find a spread or two earlier in the chapter to run
    short in order to push the note reference, or run short to pull back enough room.
    But that can lead to other problems.\r\n\r\nI'm sure Charles E. has encountered
    his share of tricky or cumbersome footnote situations. Maybe he'll stop by and
    offer his insights.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"

  body: "Ah, footnotes. They are one of the special joys of book design & composition.
    I mean that; I really enjoy the challenges they pose.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a chain
    of responsibility with footnotes that starts with the writer and ends with the
    compositor. The further you get from the writer, the less chance you have of being
    able to influence how footnotes are used and how they affect a reader\u2019s use
    of a book.\r\n\r\nThe first line of defense against poor notation systems should
    be at the editorial level. It\u2019d be interesting to find why the acquiring
    editor and the ms editor let Oliver Sacks get away with this multitude of footnotes.
    Maybe Sacks has enough clout that he can get away with it. Maybe he is messing
    around with his readers. \r\n\r\nAfter an editor has had his or her way with a
    manuscript, next in line is the designer. An in-house designer may be able to
    influence the nature of notes used in a book. I can do this, for I work in a small
    house and I follow a book from early discussions through composition.* Designers
    at large houses may not have that chance. A freelance designer has even less chance
    to influence how notes are to be used, unless the designer has very close relations
    with an editor or production manager.\r\n\r\nBy the time a book gets to the compositor
    there\u2019s not much else to be done except to make the thing look as good as
    possible, with a few roadblocks to a reader\u2019s trip through the text. Here
    it would indeed be good have charles_e\u2019s comments, and to hear if he is able
    to intervene when he spies noting schemes that look bad. Again, few compositors
    other than those with very close ties at the publisher will be able to have any
    influence.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n\r\n* We recently took in a manuscript with an enormous
    amount of notes, at 4 levels. There were citation notes, which would ordinarily
    go at the back of the book (endnotes). There were two levels of expository notes,
    one level with greater immediate importance to the author\u2019s method of writing
    history, and one lesser level. I suggested that we use a 7\u201D x 10\u201D page
    instead of the 6\u201D x 9\u201D that would be more usual for this sort of book.
    The extra inch was used to place as shoulder notes those comments the author deemed
    most immediate for readers. These are called with the usual sorts: * \u2020 \u2021
    \xA7, and are set in Franklin Gothic Book Condensed (the text face is Clifford).
    Citation notes and \u201Csecond string\u201D expository notes are called with
    superior figs and placed as endnotes. There is another level of shoulder notes,
    short biographies; these had no calls, but the persons\u2019 names were set in
    Franklin Gothic Condensed Bold. My decision to use shoulder notes made more work
    for me, but it makes for a visually dense and interesting page (I think). The
    extra inch was also helpful in a chapter that consisted almost entirely of photos;
    it let me run them that much bigger.\r\n"
