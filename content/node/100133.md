body: "Hey Typophilers,\r\n\r\nIt has been a few years since jumping on here, but
  I am in need of your help. Could you typographers give me any criticism on this
  rebranded wordmark that I have been developing. It is for the people search engine,
  known as Spokeo and is supposed to encompass a product that searches social media
  content to criminal records. There is a lot of brand strategy and thought that went
  into this wordmark, but rather than include that I want to include a simple neutral
  greyscale version rather than a sales pitch.\r\n\r\nHere is a brief rundown of what
  the brand is trying to encompass:\r\n\r\n\xB7 A company with all the tools to allow
  you to search for people and connect with them.\r\n\r\n\xB7 A company that exhibits
  integrity and transparency and is trusted by consumers.\r\n\r\n\xB7 A product/tool
  that aggregates content (not originates) allowing users to reunite and find joy
  in their connections.\r\n\r\n\xB7 A company that is seen as friendly, but not in
  a cutesy/kiddish way - Neutral.\r\n\r\n\xB7 A premium product available at an affordable
  price.\r\n\r\n\xB7 A proactive technology company pushing boundaries and using technology
  in a positive way.\r\n\r\n\xB7 A company with employees that participate in it\u2019s
  enjoyable lifestyle, rather than just being employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-White_5085.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-Black_4594.jpg]"

    this tight? Or is this a \"display\" sized version?\r\n\r\nBut apart from that
    I'm pretty sure that /e/ doesn't work. It doesn't complement other letters by
    its design style. Maybe just an idea as people are so different from each other,
    there's so much variety what if you'd put an italic transitional serif /e/ here?
    Maybe even breaking the top and bottom margins? it might complement the other
    geometric letters better than current /e/..."
