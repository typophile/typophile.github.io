body: "I went to Strand Bookstore with some friends today. I looked around in the
  rare books section a little, then I went to the graphic design and typography sections.
  (They're right next to each other.) It actually took me a while to find the typography
  section; it's right where it says on the map, but it's in shelves right underneath
  the table of comic books.\r\n\r\nSo I sat down on the floor right next to that shelf
  and looked at a bunch of books there. After having selected six books, I went downstairs
  to look at ergonomics textbooks.\r\n\r\nOn my way down, I met one of my friends.
  My friends had been looking for me for about half an hour. The friend whom I met
  had only just thought of looking for me in the typography section.\r\n\r\nI hadn't
  brought my cell phone, so my friends had even had the store announce over the loudspeaker
  that they were looking for me, but I didn't hear the announcement because I was
  so engrossed in the typography books.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that I had been in there
  for a couple hours. Unfortunately, everyone else was bored of shopping for books,
  so I didn't get to check out the ergonomics textbooks."

  body: I was delighted with your story, it just proves that I'm not the only one
    getting lost in bookstores. After a couple of such incidents my husband doesn't
    join me in them anymore, especially if the design department is of any quality/size.
    Instead, we agree a meeting point in a few hours' time and he can do as he pleases.
