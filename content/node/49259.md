  Myriad but that's not it. Also tried whatthefont but in the end thought I should
  leave it to the experts...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DEL_COL_4527.jpg]"

    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/myriad/black/|Myriad Pro Black]], to be more
    specific, and obviously you'll have to substitute the round dot on the i with
    a square one."
