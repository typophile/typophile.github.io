    it's quite ironic that \"mensch\" (from Baar's site*) means \"a person of integrity
    and honor\"...\r\n\r\n* http://www.menschengeist.de/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Fishy, indeed. In any case, I am not recommending it. I just recognised it
    and wanted to let Jims know what font they used in the sample he provided. Also,
    what would be the right thing to do in this case if you like the look of Baar
    Sophia? Buy a license of Formata and use Sophia? The relationship between the
    two is not entirely clear to me anyway. I don\u2019t have the time to compare
    glyphs, but that\u2019s what I\u2019d rather base any choices on than on the comment
    at dafont.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I think \u2018mensch\u2019 simply means \u2018human
    being, person\u2019 in German without any implications of integrity, honorability
    or honesty."

  body: "If you conclude that a font is plagiarized, compensating the designer of
    the original is nice but perhaps not enough, because people will see your use
    of the plagiarized one and you're not there to tell them what's wrong with it.
    The only way to mitigate using a plagiarized font is if that creates an opportunity
    to correct the transgression and/or raise general awareness of font plagiarism.
    But that seems pretty far-fetched.\r\n\r\nBasically it's tainted goods, and liking
    it just doesn't make using it OK. So what I would do here is buy Formata and do
    the modification myself (and of course not distribute my modified version). But
    for some people even that would be unethical (assuming the EULA does forbid any
    modification).\r\n\r\nIn any case I think it's worthwhile trying to get a straight
    answer from Lutz Baar. Especially considering it's free only for commercial use,
    and it does seem like the Madrid 2020 Summer Olympics bid logo uses it... What's
    interesting here is that the current owners of Berthold aren't at all shy about
    suing people... Maybe they're waiting to see whether Madrid wins the bid, which
    would greatly increase the value of lawsuit...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<cite>So what I would do here is buy Formata and do the modification myself
    (and of course not distribute my modified version).</cite>\r\n\r\nHere is an overlay
    of unaltered Formata Roman (first one below) and articifially straightened Formata
    Italic (second one), both in green, with Baar Sophia in black. I\u2019ve tried
    to match the x-heights and adjusted the spacing of Sophia:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/formataroman_3489.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/formataitalic_5775.png]\r\n\r\nParticularly
    in the second image, I see a lot of similarities. Still, modifying Formata to
    look like Sophia does not seem to be a five-minute job, even for an experienced
    type designer. And for regular end users, it\u2019s not feasible at all to do
    this. Maybe the only thing they can do is stay away from Sophia if they are convinced
    that it has come into existence in an unethical way. Or because they realise that
    it\u2019s quite ugly."
