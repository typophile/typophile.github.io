body: howdy y&#39;all!!! <BR>I was looking at Reader&#39;s Digest Merry Christmas
  Songbook this holiday season and became riveted on the letterforms in question.
  I&#39;m wanting to make a digital version of this font, but I can&#39;t find the
  full character set. I bought the Solotype Catalog and they&#39;re all in there,
  but I&#39;m afraid they&#39;re not good enuff for me to just scan and use, unless
  I want to spend a lot of time on each letter. I guess that Hermann Ihlenburg created
  this type and and this design belonged to American Type Founders &#40;I mighta got
  that name wrong&#41; for a while. If anyone can suggest how to go about finding
  more printed samples or even acquiring an original set of the metal type, I would
  appreciate it. Thnx for reading. <BR>paul <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/24234.gif"

  body: That does look familiar to me, and I spent a little while studying Ihlenburg&#39;s
    body of work, so I am suspecting it is indeed his. <BR> <BR>There is a collection
    of Ihlenburg stuff at the Cary Library &#40;at RIT in Rochester, New York&#41;.
    At the time it was acquired, David Pankow wrote an article about Ihlenburg&#39;s
    work. I think I have a copy of this, but it is not accessible right now, as we
    are preparing to move. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'This is in fact exactly the sort of thing ATF produced a lot of around the
    turn of the century. <BR> <BR>Your best bet is a book called &#34;Specimens of
    type, brass rules and dashes, ornaments and borders, society emblems, check lines,
    cuts, initials and other productions of the American Type Founders Co.&#34;, edited
    by A Lawson and J Bidwell &#40;New York, Garland, 1981&#41;. But that&#39;s also
    a facsimile, so it won&#39;t be the best quality. <BR> <BR>Another way would be
    to track down an actual ATF specimen book, but an early one: I suspect the famous
    1923 edition doesn&#39;t have this font. FYI, the Lawson book is based [mostly]

  body: Paul, I just looked through the 1923 ATF Specimen, and didn&#39;t see this
    in there. So, like Hrant says, you might look for an earlier one.  <BR> <BR>&#62;such
    a specimen book would cost?  <BR> <BR>I got mine off eBay - it&#39;s got a torn
    spine and two or three torn pages, and I believe I paid only $40. But I don&#39;t
    know if that&#39;s a fair average.

    hard to track him down. But I have a feeling he won&#39;t be much help sans cash.
    BTW, how lousy is the repro in the solo book? Do you have a hi-res scan handy?
    Just a few glyphs will be enough to tell. And one other thing: the sample would
    have to be <i>extremely</i> high quality for you to avoid &#34;spending a lot
    of time on each letter&#34;. And the fact that this was a metal face means that
    <i>no</i> sample is going to be extremely good anyway... One thing you could do
    though is go for the &#34;rough look&#34;. <BR> <BR>Info about ATF: You might

    no punctuation, and if you copare the letter forms to the ones that i digitized
    &#40;not to be a snob or anything&#41; secesja misses a lot of the finer subtelties
    of this fine face &#40;in my own opinion&#41; I was considering just cleaning
    up the barmee version, but i thought it&#39;d be easier just to start from scratch,

  body: You&#39;re so right! I had thought of pointing out some of the things that
    were missing but reckoned you&#39;d work &#39;em all out for yourself. Boy, what
    you&#39;ve got so far on that PDF file is miles ahead in precision. The serifs
    on uprights are completely different and it&#39;s rather difficult to work out
    from the example of the original which of you is right. One thing I know is that
    I can&#39;t wait for you to get your version finished. I&#39;ve tried out Secesja
    on projects and it&#39;s much too unstable to trust. I want yours &#40;and soon!&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve just been looking at sBob&#39;s Nymph, by the way - an extremely
    free variation which takes its beginning from Nymphic. I&#39;d always wondered
    how it got that name but assumed it was because of the rash of fairy fonts that
    were appearing back in the 1990s - WSI&#39;s Fairy Scroll Display, for instance.
    It looks like you&#39;re set to be the Prospero &#40;and to hell with bloody old
    boring Gandalph&#41; of the new Millennium. <BR> <BR>The other near approach is
    Dave Nalle&#39;s Acadian, which he made for Scriptorium in 1994. The letter forms
    are close in certain instances but his source is different from yours. The note
    reads <i>Source material from the type collection of Steve Saxe. Original design
    by H.H.Thorpe &#40;1883&#41;</i>. Now that raises a bit of interesting history,
    doesn&#39;t it? Even in those days folk were copying from and improving on one
    another&#39;s work. Is there a history of this aspect of fo&#40;u&#41;nt evolution,
    do you know? <BR> <BR>Mb

    <BR>The G, in the pdf, has two different shapes. <BR>The M... 4 different shapes.
    <BR>Is the variation something you are going for? <BR>The falling swash thing
    of the C in the scan looks like it&#39;s more of a teardrop shape, rather than
    a ball at the end of the line. <BR>My favorite character is the lower r. Looks

  body: '&#62;&#62;jimenez, <BR>i&#39;m not quite sure what that prospero commet was
    about, but I rather like gandalf! <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;brian,  <BR>thanks for the
    criticism. to answer you briefly - yes, these letterforms &#40;of mine&#41; are
    still in their formative stages. right now i&#39;ve been focusing more on standardizing
    the uprights and serifs and just smoothing out the general outline. i&#39;ll pay
    more attention to the ball serifs once i get that outta the way. i think i&#39;ll
    try to standardize them, leaning more toward a ball serif for the uppercase, but
    i really have been trying to stay true to the printed samples that i have available
    to me. but that presents another problem... the quality of the printed samples
    i have varies, so i&#39;m unsure sometimes how i should proceed. The ball on the
    falling swash of the C is just one case in point... I&#39;ll post some scan comparisons
    tomorrow so you can see what i mean. anyhow, the short answer to your question
    is yes, the ball serifs should be standardized &#40;as much as possible&#41; but
    i don&#39;t believe all of them were the same even in the original font... like
    i said i&#39;m just trying to stay true to Hermann. for now this project is just
    more of a learning experience for me as i&#39;m not eally an &#34;xpert,&#34;
    just a novice here. This is actually my first attempt at trying to put a font
    together. &#40;this weekend i was trying to teach my self how to add open type
    features and was moderately sucessful!&#41; maybe someday if i ever get the polish
    just right on this one i&#39;ll try to realease it for marketing or something.
    i&#39;d love to hear your other questions though! i&#39;ve got a question for
    you, since you&#39;re a perfectionist &#40;like i try to be&#41; what do you think
    of the mismatched spurs &#40;take a look at the C, G &amp; S&#41; Some i&#39;ve
    rounded off and some are still sharp on the ends. do you think that detracts from
    the design? anyhow, thanks for your input. <BR> <BR>Anyhow, I was looking at some
    information that somebody originaly gave me that tipped me off on the designer
    of this font and it says that this face originaly belonged to a foundry named
    MacKellar. <a href="http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Ihlenburg/Ihlenburg.pdf"
    target="_blank">http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Ihlenburg/Ihlenburg.pdf</a>
    <BR> <BR>Anybody know anything about this foundry? Anyhow, my search goes on...

  created: '2004-01-27 02:56:53'
- body: I really, really like the mismatched spurs. The variation makes the letters
    themselves more interesting and also gives them a sense of contrast between hard/soft
    edges. It also looks like it might help when balancing the letters out. With the
    S, if you used the pokey spur up top, it would have to be even larger than the
    soft one &#40;already larger than the ones in the C &amp; G&#41;, I imagine. Also
    with the S...the pointy spur is next to the soft ball terminal, and then at the
    top, the soft spur is next to a pointy ending...really nice. <BR>And I&#39;ve
    had a question for some time that I just haven&#39;t asked about, but it is coming
    up again while looking at the pdf. Should capitals be wider than the lowercase?
    Gill Sans is one typeface that really stands out to me, and I don&#39;t like using
    it for that reason. All the capital letters look like they are semibold &#40;in
    gill.&#41; With nymph, if that&#39;s the case, I don&#39;t mind it, because it
    seems to fit the idea of it being a display face. I know with small caps, it&#39;s
    important to have them the same width. Maybe someone can explain more about that?
    <BR>Oh, and the other questions I had are nothing to worry about. It mostly was
    just about outlines that looked off, such as how the bottom edge of the curl in
    the cap R doesn&#39;t line up. But that&#39;s an easy thing to do, and I&#39;m
    sure now is something you were saving &#39;til later. I&#39;ve always had a bad
    tendency of not working from general to specific. One day I&#39;ll kick the habit
    for good! <BR> <BR>Liking it a lot though. Bellevue turned me off to ball terminals,
    but I like them in this! <BR> <BR>

    I&#39;ve seen of this font &#40;which is a small number&#41; are with the lower

    alt="Scan Comparison">&#60;/font&#62;so as you can see the scan to the left is
    from the songbook i mentioned in my initial post, the scan to the right is from
    the solotype catalog. so from the one on the right it seems to me that the ball
    serif on the C is actually a ball whereas on the right it looks like a teardrop.
    this is exactly why i am interested in finding more high quality print samples,
    so i can keep as true to the design as possible... still looking for those samples
    tho &#40;can be hard here in rural Arizona&#41; so if anyone has any hot leads
    for me, i&#39;m still hunting...'
