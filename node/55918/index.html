		<div class="commentbody">Being European, but having spent a good year in the US*, I spontaneously think of [this is a very unordered list]:

Cream Soda, Root Beer, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (yum), oversized servings of ice cream &ndash; actually oversized everything (like cars and trucks, or people).

Total consumerism. 
The constant promise (and expectation) of instant gratification.
Loads of avoidable trash, like heaps of plastic bags at the supermarket.

Simple interfaces, like washing machines that have "hot", "warm", and "cold"; 
over here you might just need that 50-page manual to operate a washing machine. 

A (perceived) strange contrast between a general self-image of total individual independence and a somewhat lemming-like social behavior (like everywhere else, but at least seeming exaggerated).

* My impressions are from uh, 7–8 years ago, and I bet some things have changed. 
I haven't been back since, sadly.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I grew up in the inner city of Pittsburgh in the late 40s and beyond. The city was always full of immigrants, including my family. I guess what has always struck me as American is the mishmash of everything. There are not thousands of years of heritage like Europe so there is this eclectic chaos with no order to it. Today, immigrants are from different places than when I was young. Instead of Poland and Italy, they come from East Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia and Latin America. I wouldn't call it a melting pot but a mixing bowl. This can cause both friction and embracing each-other's culture. It is what you make of it. If you want to think only evil and accept the media's exaggeration, go ahead. The truth is, we are no better or no worse than anywhere else.

we might not be any worse.  (although i'm not sure of that;
i can certainly see the argument that we epitomize evil...)

the problem is that we sincerely believe we are far superior.

and we are smug and arrogant about that superiority, too...

The kind of freedom of speech we have in America is such that many things are said outloud or in print that are downright repulsive to most of us but protected by our constitution. I for one would like to see Rush Limbaugh get his mouth permanently taped shut (and he mine perhaps) but I know we have to alow everyone an open mike.  This means that people in Europe and the rest of the world hear the worst of our reprehensible blithering the loudest and might assume this is what all Americans think. And yes, we are a friendly people in spite of it all.

perhaps.

but outside of dictatorships, very few countries practice the kind of
"we're the greatest country in the world" propaganda america does...

(that "well, we _are_!" that some are thinking right now, is part of it.)

on the flip side, almost all the people i've known from other countries
do indeed confirm americans overall tend to be very friendly people.
in fact, "friendly" is far and away the most common observation of all

apologies to the original poster, though, who was looking for "objects".

What percent of Seattle is "original"? From my experience, very few. The rest is made up of 25% Californians looking to get away from the city, 25% Minnesotans looking to get away from the country, and 45% foreign matter. 

If only we could get rid of the Californians :)

Russell is correct. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units">Imperial Units</a> (or measures) were introduced in the UK and used in its colonies, so yes, the Founding Fathers are sleeping well on that count. :-)</div>

negativity?  stereotypes?

i don't see how jeans, or harleys, or ketchup, or electric guitars, 
or apple pie, or pickup trucks, or ice-cold drinks are  _negative_.

and the negative stuff that _is_ here?

it's based on _honesty_, and long-time solid _observation_...

you couldn't have expressed american ethnocentrism better...

And I'm not living in a dreamworld, I know the stereotypes are there-for me it's fat children. I never realized how fat the kids were here until I went to Argentina and saw normal-sized kids! I'm not saying that the stereotypes don't exist, it just bothers me that they do and that people from different countries are always so sure of them (ie. "it's based on honesty, and long-time solid observation.) Before you lump me into that general comment you made at the end of your post, let me just say that you misread my intention. What I'm trying to say is that from MY personal experience I don't hear people in America doing this with other countries. I mean, I can't imagine making this list of things found in England and if I did, it would probably be something more positive-this is all I'm saying. And now I'm going back to observing fonts.</div>

i don't know where any of the commenters here live,
so you might be right that the negative aspects are
being listed by the non-americans.  or maybe not,
since i've pointed out some of the negative aspects,
and i'm american.  my significant other for a decade,
however, was european, so i do have something of
a more-objective perspective than most americans,
since i've heard lots of people from lots of countries
relating their observations about us.  and these were
_not_ observers who had some kind of axe to grind...
indeed, as i said up above, almost all of 'em said that
americans are among the world's friendliest people...
that is, they usually described a mix of good and bad,
not just with america, but for other countries as well,
including their own...  (often _especially_ their own!)

Janet, being one of the 'foreigners' in this thread, and having posted only nice things for a change :o), I think that you'd find that the harsh comments here came in fact from Americans.

You know, I didn't take this huge offense to the posts-it was your last comment on your first post that hit a nerve because it was true and I felt dumb. Human, yes I am. I think a lot about stereotypes lately as a native NYer who has just moved to a crunchy part of Cally and thinks about culture distinctions pretty much on a daily basis.

no reason for you to feel "dumb".  we're brainwashed to believe
that we live in "the best country on earth" from a very young age.

and because, on a huge number of dimensions, it is indeed true,
we come to believe very strongly that it's true.  and often it _is_...

so it's a very thorny thing.  nothing to beat yourself up over...

***

>   Like it or not bowerturd its the truth.

it's clear to everyone in the world that the u.s. "sets the standard".

we've got the bomb, and we have shown we aren't afraid to use it...

we also feel no compulsion against ripping off third-world resources,
which -- combined with those from our own large country -- means
we've been able to live the richest lifestyle of anyone for decades now.
we are the pigs of the planet.  (with apologies to our porcine brothers.)

and we always win lots of medals in the olympics, because we don't
mind cheating -- never have -- and we have a fairly large population.
(divide the medal-count by population, and our advantage vanishes.)

and without us, russia probably would have never defeated hitler...

so we got a lot of brownie points for that, for good reason...

but china has a _very_ large population, and they're getting richer and
richer all the time -- stockpiling american dollars and a ton of euros --
and they don't mind cheating either, as shown in the last olympics, so
it won't be long before _they_ call the shots, um... "set the standards"...

but hey, on the bright side, they have a huge need for font-makers!


>   Wow its been three weeks now right?

more like 16 days and 5 hours.  but who's counting?

ok, now you're screwing up your apostrophes just to mess with me.       :+)

Lengthy post are a nuisance and so is a person who
makes them self comfortable with people they don't know.
