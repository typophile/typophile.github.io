  body: The digitization is <em>very</em> poor, so this is either a crappy tracing
    of an existing typeface (maybe Annonce Gothic?) or a custom drawn logo.

  body: No, this isn't Annonce. Brendel Informatik's "Quinta" is the crappy tracing
    of this typeface which tells me its not custom drawn and does exist. Thanks anyways.
