  body: "From a design standpoint I agree with the others that it is generic and common
    looking. I do like the actual logo but your typeface choice is what drags it down.
    You and your partner(s) should look at the direction of your company and what
    image you are trying to project to potential clients\u2014upscale, modern, traditional,
    whatever you intend your business to represent. There are thousands of typefaces
    out there that could probably do a better job of illustrating your company's identity\u2014once
    you decide what it is\u2014than Myriad (I believe that is what you are using).
    \ Kevin, this is your company's identity and using a designer might be a prudent
    decision on your part. The right branding for your future would be worth it. "

  body: Like the Net, Myriad is every-bloody-where already, so not a bad choice from
    that point of view, but there has to be something with a bit more bite to it.
    Akzidenz? Neuzeit? Fira Sans? Selawik?

    pretty simple. Is there any other similar font that we can try?

    body: Isn't this forum's purpose exactly for the reason to perfect on something
      one's doing themselves? Suggesting to hire a designer isn't really helping in
      this regard. Ok. So this logo is rather generic and something we've seen many
      times over, but regardless to that, OP's question was clear and I think it deserves
      helping posts to suggest better fonts.

  body: "I'm a little late to the discussion, but I like the use of Myriad with the
    logo for precisely the reason others have given for not liking it \u2014 it's
    generic. \r\n\r\nOther typefaces might work just as well, but sometimes a good,
    generic typeface is preferable to one with a stronger or more distinctive personality.
    In this instance, the focus should be on the logo (the symbol), which is where
    the dynamic personality in the composition should be. The main purpose of the
    typography is to communicate the name of the company and do so in a way that supports
    the logo, which Myriad does nicely. Myriad is a well- designed typeface (even
    though it's sort of a Frutiger copy). It's highly legible, and it has a soft,
    friendly, business-like quality to it. It also doesn't compete with the logo by
    introducing a conflicting personality. Like I said, other typefaces could work
    just as well, but I wouldn't discount Myriad due to it being too generic."

    logo, using ROPA SANS PRO, Light (by lettersoup), available at myfonts: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lettersoup/ropa-sans-pro/\r\nVersion
    1. Just using Ropa Sans Pro Light to add a bit of tension to the feel of the logo\r\nVersion
    2. Coloring the 'marketing' bit to emphasize the marketing aspect\r\nVersion 3.
    I'm not entirely sold on the 'internet marketing co.' as a name... so, just to
    jazz it up a bit...\r\n\r\nAgain... only to get the creative juices flowing..."
