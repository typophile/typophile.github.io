  Gin logo (the one used in the word \"Beafeater\"). According to the company, a custom
  designed font was used. So I'm really just looking for a font which looks a similar
  as possible.\r\n\r\nAny hints would be highly appreciated!\r\n\r\nBest regards"

    is not a layered font--and I don't know if the font Beefeater commissioned is,
    either. So you may want to hit fontsquirrel and other sites looking specifically
    for layered fonts that may get you yet closer. At least if the multi-part, different
    color is important.\r\n\r\nMike"

    hitting up fontsquirrel too, thanks.\r\n\r\nBest regards"
