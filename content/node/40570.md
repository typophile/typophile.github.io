body: Can anyone identify this font?  It appears in a number of invitation albums,
  however each has its own "exclusive" name.  I need it for envelope addressing.  Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unknown_6362.jpg]

  body: "I scanned through the old ClipArt Handwritten Fonts collection, which still
    turns up pretty often for these kinds of fonts, but didn't see this one. As we
    say in the FAQ these hand-printed fonts are so easy and cheap to make that there
    is no way to ever catalog them all. The link Stephen has above ends with having
    your own font made -- it's that easy -- and some sites will do it for under $10.
    This means it's often best to pick something similar, and use it.\r\n\r\n- Mike
