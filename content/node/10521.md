  font from the sixties designed by Rick Griffin? The graphic was to large to upload,
  so here is where the image can be found. Thanks for your help! <BR><a href="http://flyingeyeball.com/public_html/pages/flyingeyeball.html"

  body: It&#39;s not a font. Every bit of it was lettered by Griffin in his own unique
    style. It&#39;s possible that there are fonts inspired by his lettering, but I
    can&#39;t think of any. Some art nouveau fonts have a similar feel, but not the
    wild, hallucinogenic quality.
