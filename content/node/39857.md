body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Typeface Series</strong>\r\n\r\nA typeface
  series is a set of typefaces that form a [[family]], a [[superfamily]] or even have
  a looser connection, for example are designed by the same designer with a common
  thought in mind. So, any family or superfamily is a series, but also [[Verdana]],
  [[Tahoma]], [[Nina]] and [[Meiryo]] form a series, though not a family nor a superfamily.
  Another example of a series are Arepo, Stone Print, SFPL, and Cycles by [[Sumner
  Stone]].\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/39843\">Type
