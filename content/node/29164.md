  body: "HI there, \r\n\r\nA nice simple logo that I think could work quite nicely.
    \r\n\r\nA couple of little things, I dont know how you feel about it but I have
    never been a great fan of kerning letters to the extreme that they start to fall
    apart. I think the PARTNER on the MP-var version is a no go. The other two work
    a lot better, they work as one element. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it may just be my eyes
    but I think that the MAINT part of the logo is maybe kerned a little too tightly.
    Because the MAI are kerned to the extent where they are attached to each other
    the uprights start to create some strange negative spacing and shapes, I can almost
    see a 'W' and a 'V' in there, I think that maybe you should open up the kerning
    a little, and then see how the letters react to each other. \r\n\r\nIf you are
    as you say going to be using this on vehicles and signage, the logo does need
    to be a little clearer. It may blur into a shape rather than read as a word as
    you have it now. \r\n\r\nMatt\r\n"

    Remove the trapping - the slight bends in the \"crotches\" of the \"N\"s, the
    top-inside of the \"A\", etc.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "To my eyes the biggest issue is the the spacing in partner. The PA & AR are
    too loose compared to the rest of the text. I would loosen the rest of the text
    Instead of tightening the others however untill the they match the A & it's sidebearings.
    You could overcome some of the odd shapes in Maint by making a dot on the i. \r\n\r\nThis
    will sound a bit heavy I am affraid but do you have anything else? Why these types
    anyway? It looks okay to me but only okay. Do you have time to consider other
    options?"

  body: Thanks for the input, I've loosened the kerning a bit, and cleaned the letter
    shapes (trappings etc). I'm going with the larger 'partner' text, as it does make
    the logo look more like a whole. I'll post a pic when I get the chance.
