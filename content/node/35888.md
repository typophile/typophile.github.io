    \r\n\r\nBut it's much more decorative than the original posted."

  body: Hopefully, someone will give a definite ID. Thought I'd mention, though, that
    Dan Zadorozny's <a href="http://www.iconian.com/r.html" target="_blank">Regulators</a>
    (and the included condensed variant) is <em>very</em> similar.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_1_6666.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhile Regulators
    is the closest match yet, it's line quality is horrible. It's possible that it
    was cleaned up for this use, but more likely it wasn't.\r\n\r\nI'll email Iconian
    Fonts and see if they might have a clue to the original. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
