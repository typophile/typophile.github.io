As this has caused much more of a stir than I intended it to and in fairness to the original designers, I have now removed the entries until the final winner is picked. Initial post is below&hellip;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have run a competition for a logo design recently, and although we kind of like the logos attached, we are not certain how well they will scale for other parts of our design. Many of the entrants have utilised popular design fonts, which I can integrate into the current design (navigation etc.) to see how it feels overall. This particular font though, I cannot pin point, even though a few contestants have utilised it.</p>
<p>As you can see, there is the main logo font, which is a sans-serif. I have narrowed it down to Pacific Sans and Normandy Isle JNL via the &lsquo;what the font&rsquo; website, but I could be missing a more popular/standard typeface.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sorry, have edited initial post to clear it up. We can&rsquo;t ask contestants during the competition as it is not fair to them all - could get their hopes up for nothing and they would probably not want to divulge the information because they then think you could make your own.</p>
<p>About 4 or 5 utilised the main font identified above, they just all created their own spin on the badge/stamp. Again for the scripts, we are not sure if these would look right/be readable for smaller sub headings, so we would still like to identify the fonts if possible.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">the bottom one must be <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/alex-brush/|Alex Brush]]</strong>
but I&rsquo;m not convinced too by your reasoning on why you don&rsquo;t ask the original designers.
If asking them directly would have raised suspicions that you could make your own,
asking to id the fonts in a public site like typophile without their knowledge is even worst.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok I take your points seriously that this is a public discussion and so will remove the images above until we pick the winner. The competition is closed for entries (and has been before I posted first), we just have to pick a final winner - we aren&rsquo;t allowed to pick more than one and we are not allowed to contact designers direct whilst the competition doesn&rsquo;t have a winner. Yes, I tried yesterday after your comments above.</p>
<p>With this in mind we needed to find a logo and typeface that would fit in with the overall aesthetic of the website, future branding (such as business cards etc) and how it would look utilised in certain accent sections of the site.</p>
<p>I was trying to ID certain fonts because I like them and wanted to see how they would look in this context. Other who have utilised standard fonts I can already do this with - and if I wanted to copy their logos I could quite easily do that. As I have pointed out though, we have guaranteed a winner and we would never rip someone else&rsquo;s design off. I just want to make sure I pick the correct one - and not just because I don&rsquo;t know the font they used.</p>
<p>The worst thing is, these designs aren&rsquo;t even in our top 3 at the moment, there are many others who have utilised the same font with different takes on the badge/stamp that were much better. I really did just like the fonts and wanted to try them.</p>
<p>Anyway, many thanks for helping out for those that did.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you for the find of the main font DPape.</p>
<p>@hrant - The competition is closed and we have guaranteed a winner. I did not mention this in the initial post due to this very reason - I didn&rsquo;t want it to come across as though we would try and replicate it on our own.</p>
<p>The main reason we are trying to locate the font is because we like it but are not quite sure it would work scaled larger/smaller for navigation use,  etc.  Most of the other entries utilise common typefaces (trajan pro, century, gills sans, itc franklin gothic pro), of which I can already test how they would work in the new design, but I had no idea what this was as I had never seen it before.</p>
<p>We are just making sure we do everything possible beforehand to pick the right one for use across the site. It would probably be worse if we picked one of these as the winner and then didn&rsquo;t use it!</p>
<p>We would never try and re-create or claim work as our own, it would be stupid of us to do so since we promoted the initial competition on our very own site and have showcased a gallery of submissions to our audience already for their vote on what they like best.</p>
<p>If anyone has ideas on the script fonts then please let me know.</p>
