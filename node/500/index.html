		<div class="commentbody">Naiditch doesn't design type - he's the Curator of Medieval &amp; Renaissance Manuscripts at UCLA Special Collections. He was the guy in charge of the project (along with Sue Kaplan). Lange does design type, but that wasn't his involvement in that project - he was the typographer. Along with Carter they arrived at the choice of Manutius because that's what their collective typographic expertise told them. They spent a small fortune on just the font. They didn't choose it because it came after Mandrill in their font menu. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>That said, I think for Don's project a old Italian face would probably be best. But it doesn't have to be from the 1500s in Florence - that's too restrictive.

		<div class="commentbody">I think Jenson is the dream typeface for this project - don't reject it because it is so logical to use it!. <BR> <BR>Jenson doesn't just happen to be of the period. The original breathes of that same confidence and disipline and panache as the renaissance thinkers, including Machiavelli. It is not just a question of using something of the same period. It is another example of renaissance brilliance, matched to Machiavelli himself. <BR> <BR>Now which Jenson best suits your project is a more difficult question. None of course capture exactly the spirit of the original. Actually the italic of Abobe Jenson might work as James suggests. And the Open type does have both the archic long 's' roman (that looks like and 'f') and italic (like the integral sign). <BR> <BR>I would also look at Hightower and Italian Oldstyle at least.</div>

Since so many of the Aldine books were in Greek, having a nicely paired Greek and Latin for the bibliography was extremely important.</div>

But  <BR>if you do decide to go that route, and especially if you  <BR>want something with that rough faux-letterpress look,  <BR>then you should really consider Monotype <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/poliphilus/mt-regular/testdrive.html?s=Machiavelli&amp;p=72" target="_blank">Poliphilus</a>,  <BR>since that's what it was designed for. <BR> <BR>Poliphilus was a metal interpretation of the third roman  <BR>made for Aldus by Griffo and used in <i>Hypnerotomachia  <BR>Poliphili,</i> printed in Venice in 1499. You can't get much  <BR>more historically allusive than that. Monotype recreated  <BR>the Poliphilus in 1923, with all its bumps and warts, for  <BR>a facsimile publication of the <i>Hypnerotomachia.</i> <BR> <BR>I'm surprised no one mentioned it sooner. <BR> <BR>&ndash; Kent. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks so much for all of the informative posts! <BR> <BR>I've got plenty of choices to mull over at this point, though I'm leaning in the direction of Adobe Jenson, perhaps in the style that James suggests. William's eloquence in praise of Jenson is also very persuasive. <BR> <BR>Steve, one thing about using a modern typeface: due to the unique nature of the medium, in which type is superimposed or woven into the images, it would look somewhat jarring (IMO) for a modern typeface to be juxtaposed with images of Renaissance Florence. The comics medium is what demands of me an approach to text which complements my approach to imagery.  <BR> <BR>I refuse to use the common &quot;comics&quot; fonts in this piece, as those emerged as the type of choice for children's adventure comics, and are more appropriate for that genre. (That style of writing in comics has become ubiquitous as the superhero genre became so dominant that few questioned treating text in comics any other way&ndash;but that's another hobby horse and perhaps not germane to this forum) <BR> <BR>If you're interested in what the hell I'm talking about, you can view the prologue to Machiavelli &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://www.donmacdonald.com/Machiavelli/machframe.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.donmacdonald.com/Machiavelli/machframe.html">http://www.donmacdonald.com/Machiavelli/machframe.html</a></a>&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I apologise in advance for the horrible calligraphy on page 2, which has descenders and ascenders crashing into one another. I was still stretching my legs&hellip;</div>

He's right, it is an odd choice, which is not to say that it is not readable, appropriate in other ways (harmonises with the Greek, handles the textual articulation well, etc.).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You can reach dfTYPE (Rialto) here <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.druckschriften.de/Druckschriften2/Typo-Top-100/Schriften/df-type/df-type.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.druckschriften.de/Druckschriften2/Typo-Top-100/Schriften/df-type/df-type.html">http://www.druckschriften.de/Druckschriften2/Typo-Top-100/Schriften/df-type/df-type.html</a></a>  <BR> <BR> <BR>Since I was involved in the typographic consulting on The Aldine Press project here were the considerations. First, this is first and foremost a catalog of bibliographic descriptions. It is secondarily a book about Aldus. A typeface was needed, any typeface, that had a workable Greek, Latin, roman. By workable I mean we would need &quot;on a discovery&quot; basis, &quot;every&quot; G/L/r letterform that existed as incunabular (including those that no longer exist) as well as any G/L/r letterform that was currently of use in the twentieth century. Matthew was our only choice. Not only as a designer but as a knowledgable historian of type. At the time there was no italic for the Miller and that would have to be developed as well. &quot;He&quot; named the face Manutius in honor of the project and for no other reason. This particular configuration of the Miller/Wilson face no longer exists as it was developed solely for use in this project. <BR> <BR>I've found that bibliographic descriptions, dictionaries, etc, go a bit beyond their subject matter and are bibliographically considered a subject in themselves. They are certainly categorized that way in every library system that I know of.  <BR> <BR>RB, as I recall from an email he sent to me, was a bit more emotional about this than he now claims. He also felt my use of Miller for a faux nineteenth-century book about Gutenberg was wrong as obviously anything about Gutenberg should be set in a blackletter. His latching on to subject matter prevented him from seeing the structure that existed beyond the subject matter, a nineteenth century interpretation, a bibliographic description catalog. <BR> <BR>No incunabular or Renaissance form can adequately provide the legibility/readability needs that would be required in printed matter where such concerns are paramount. Early forms that existed before these historical concerns raised their ugly little heads are often inadequate. Every interpretation of these early forms runs into this problem.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the kind words. I'm one step ahead of you: I work at Harvard Business School Publishing, the upside of which is that I just bought Adobe Type Classics for $80. It <i>is</i> an amazing deal. <BR> <BR>It looks like my type decisions are going to work out as follows: <BR>1) Handwritten script based on Machiavelli's handwriting for diary entries or letters. This is the treatment that I used in the prologue, when Machiavelli descibes the Pazzi conspiracy in a manuscript. <BR>2) Adobe Jenson italic for excerpts from published works and captions that are not written by Machiavelli <BR>3) A handwritten Jenson Italic for dialogue. I've chosen this approach because of the inappropriateness of traditional comic fonts for this project, and the fact that it will make for easier reading than a script. <BR> <BR>As for the market, there is a small market for art/alternative comics: books like Maus, Jimmy Corrigan, From Hell, Safe Area Gorazde. This book is unlike those in execution, but similar in aims: to use comics as a medium to tell a complex story with a desire to be artistically innovative as well. (I hope that didn't sound too pretentious: basically, there are a number of people out there who believe in comics' potential as an art form that is capable of more than adolescent power fantasies.) <BR> <BR>But it's not a great way to get rich. :-)</div>
