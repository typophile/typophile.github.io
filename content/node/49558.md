body: I'm developing a brand identity for a very old traditional British brand that
  will be sold globally. They've ask for a "Traditional British" feel to the logotype.
  The current logo is a modified Copperplate, and while I need to maintain a similar
  feel to the brandmark I'd was hoping for a few recommendations on what you all might
  consider "Traditional British" typos.
