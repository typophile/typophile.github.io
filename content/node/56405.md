body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nattached (if upload works) you should find Malz, a
  fat, malty display font sketch.\r\nIt was drawn with pencil the last months, before
  redrawing it as vectors (with a few revisions already).\r\n\r\nWhat I want to know?
  Some feedback, some ideas ... There are for sure lots of detail flaws in it, so
  i'd be more interested in feedback for the \"big picture\" or single characters,
  but not \"curve details\" yet.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nquite an update (see
  new file Malz14.pdf)\r\n- 2 styles (old-fashioned and more modern)\r\n- many minor
  tweaks\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nsome quick stuff:\r\nSebastian[img:sites/default/files/old-images/styling_6550.gif]\r\n\r\nthanks
  for your thoughts and time\r\n"

  body: "I think it looks pretty good.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the 's' and the
    'g' are breaking the upward/horizontal flow a bit. They have their most apparant
    parts angled in the opposite direction from the other characters (the bottom part
    of the 's' and the loop of the 'g' respectively).\r\n\r\nAnd I think the 'r' is
    too wide. The 't' also jumps out, since it's leaning to the right while most of
    the other characters have a leftward lean. The 'z' also stands out.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not saying you should totally iron everything out, but they're points to consider
    nonetheless. :)"

  body: "Or you could go the other way and introduce more variety to those squarish,
    tilted-up letters. Which direction do you like better, \"Fr\xFCschoppen\" (more
    similarity) or \"Festzelt\" (more variety)?"

  body: I think this is a pretty solid shot at a font like this. Seems like you could
    cheat some angles and make some strokes thinner in some spots where you have thicker
    spots. Like the M, etc. Seems like the stroke varies from letter to letter as
    well? Also the V-Y have some issues with the angle? seems like a diff font. Great
    job.

  body: "I like it a lot. It makes me feel like cracking open a brewski.\r\n\r\nI
    also think that the 'r' is a bit too wide as the large counter formed under it's
    ear contrasts greatly with the small counters in the rest of the text.\r\n\r\nIt
    would be nice to see some more alternate characters to add variety. Adding alternates
    could emphasize the playful and hand-painted look of the font IMO.\r\n\r\nNice
    work Sebastian."

  body: "overall: i love it.\r\n\r\nwhat you might consider:\r\nV and W (uc and lc)
    look a bit out of balance. (maybe they had too many seidels?)\r\ni like the round
    E on page 3 better than the straight one. \r\nsome of the accents could be more
    distinct. grave and acute should be steeper. they look too much like macrons.\r\n\r\nlooking
    at Malz makes me thirsty. i need a beer right now."

  body: "some update (see first posting).\r\n\r\nI have created a second \"style\"
    by making alternatives to some letters. Not quite sure how far this should go.\r\n\r\nV
    W X Y v w x y in the \"normal\" style have changed quite a lot, making them more
    consistent to the rest.\r\n\r\nr is quite narrower.\r\n\r\nThere are still some
    details to change (counter of the \"e\", ..., ...).\r\nWhat else do you see?\r\n\r\nAnd
    I really don't know what to do with the uppercase \"S\" ...\r\n\r\nThanks for
    your thoughts\r\nSebastian"
