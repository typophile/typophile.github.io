  body: "We seem to get soccer shirt lettering questions a lot, and I think very often
    the best we can do is suggest something similar, because they are so often custom
    designs.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to look at the \"techno\" fonts at Dafont and
    T-26. Something at one of those sites is bound to be similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
