  body: "Some joker registered the domain name <cite>ofallevil.com</cite>, and then
    configured the DNS so that <cite>thesource.ofallevil.com</cite> points to the
    same IP address as <cite>www.microsoft.com</cite> (207.46.199.30).\r\n\r\nSo you
    can take any Web page off www.microsoft.com and change the <cite>www.microsoft.com</cite>
    part to <cite>thesource.ofallevil.com</cite>, and you'll still get to the same
    page. The URL you posted is just one example.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity: How did
    you come by that URL?"
