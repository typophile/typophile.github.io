  body: I like No 2's direction, although I associate the brush with painting, rather
    than beauty supply. You could use a Mascara Brush instead...and I'd suggest staying
    away from lipstick, overdone. Maybe the trailing curvature could sweep off like
    spilled blush or something of a powder?

  body: "\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich typeface is Szepseg ?\r\n\r\nmaybe trend can be hand generated?
    considering the seemingly unpredictable/changing  nature of a new trend\r\n\r\nso
    > Szepseg means beautiful?, i'm not convinced that the typeface is the best choice
    for beauty...\r\n\r\nmaybe the whole thing is hand generated?\r\n\r\nmaybe  translate
    the brush and make it work with the swashy G? \r\n\r\nmaybe a shoe heel? \r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\na
    more fashion-like brush, some object that speaks about beauty more?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Number 4 is the best because you aren't fighting the typefaces. But \"TREND\"
    will be hard to read if it's small, far away, or the viewer is in motion (driving).\r\n\r\nI'm
    with Rez: re-think what the purpose of the logo is and what qualities it is meant
    to show. Sz\xE9ps\xE9g is a serif face that's interesting but not too special,
    so your logo will want to be subtle and sophisticated. If you want to be playful,
    find type that works together at being playful.\r\n\r\nGood luck."
