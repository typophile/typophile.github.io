  certainly be glad to hear it. Have a nice weekend.\r\nPetter[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Helmut_Lang_5070.JPG]"

  body: The Helmut Lang font is definitely not Helvetica. I'm not sure what it is,
    and I always loved how the inner angles of the M cuts into the top, It's a very
    elegant touch. However, it could be a modified Helvetica.

  body: i love the typo. Its so simple, perfect, minimal but still human and warm.
    And it suits kongenial to the products. Unfortunately he, Helmut, sold his company.
    He s an artist and not a businessman, Respect to Helmut.

  body: "It DOES look like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica/cond-bold/\">Helvetica
    Condensed Bold</a> as Jazzy noted. Consider the old cut, not the \xBBHelvetica
    Neue\xAB rework. "
