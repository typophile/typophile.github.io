body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have been working for a while on a book where I use a custom
  typeface. Recently I upgraded to InDesign CS5, and when I opened my book project
  all the spaces (especially En/Em dash) had shrunk a lot! Suddenly 2xEm dash is as
  narrow as maybe half of an En dash. Since the design of the book is almost finished,
  I really want the typeface to display as before, or else I will have to remake a
  lot of typesetting... Does anyone know why this happened? Can I change it somehow?
  Can I set these measurements somewhere in fontlab? What has changed since before?\r\n\r\nHope
  that someone have knowledge about this, thanks in advance!\r\n/\r\nAron"

  body: "Oh, sorry! Sloppy of me, what I mean is still SPACES. I have used a lot of
    indents, Em space in this case, that is appearing very narrow. Thanks for pointing
    that out. Also the width of the normal space seems a bit off too, but I know where
    to edit this, and it shouldn't be affected by the same settings as the en/em space
    right? \r\n\r\nI have tried to export new versions of the font without any luck.
    In fact, I have two fonts deriving from the same Fontlab project, and they both
    have this issue. It's just strange that it worked fine in CS3. Unfortunately I
    removed CS3 before noticing this problem, otherwise I could have just finished
    it there... But now I am curious to understand why this is happening and how to
    fix it. There must be some settings controlling these measurements? Or is it defined
    by InDesign? An Em space for example is always as big, no matter which typeface
    you use right? A square in the same point size as you are currently using?"

  body: "Problem solved! Thanks for that K.L.\r\nThe font had glyphs for en/em space
    amongst others that CS3 apparently didn't read, but CS5 did. I simply deleted
    all redundant glyphs and then it worked fine."

  body: Were you creating indents by inserting spaces? You'll have greater control
    and flexibility if you use Paragraph settings, or even better, Paragraph Styles
    to handle that sort of thing.
