  body: "Thank you WhatFontis and donshottype , I had come to the same conclusions
    also. Very similar, and I appreciate your help very much.\r\n\r\nRyuk, thank you
    very much for your help, that certainly nearly concludes things for me.\r\n\r\nOne
    last question if anyone can help, are they any tutorials on the internet for how
    to create a triline/multiline font using an existing font? I use illustrator pretty
    well, but don't have any idea how to do this to perfection.\r\n\r\nThank you all
    again for your help, I appreciate it very much.\r\n"

  body: "In support of Ryuk's suggestion that the FO design used Gotham as a base,
    I note that the website for Crown Metropol uses the Gotham Medium webfont.\r\nYou
    can make a multiline font from an existing font -- preferably a sans -- in Fontlab
    by using the parallel lines feature. Use pull down tabs: Tools -> Action -> Effects
    -> Parallel. Then edit the result. Repeat as required. \r\nWith proper attention
    to detail the results should be as good as any of the fonts mentioned.\r\nDon"

  body: donshottype - Thankyou, I will give that a crack. I have had minimal experience
    in font programs, but your explanation is very good.  Cheers again.
