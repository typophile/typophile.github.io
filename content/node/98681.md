  get an understanding of the process. I have little grasp of the advanced terminology)...\r\n\r\nI
  found an old european book that has a few alphabets that i would like to digitize.
  I have done a search of the author ( i assume he designed the alphabets as no other
  credit is given), and it appears he has been dead for over 20 years. Very little
  other info.\r\n\r\nI can make vector drawings of the glyphs, but after that i wouldnt
  have the knowledge or the patience to do what else is needed to turn them into a
  working font.\r\n\r\ni'm glad to hire someone to do it for me if the cost seems
  reasonable.  \r\nadvice?\r\nthanks!!\r\n"

    suggestion is that you buy a copy of TypeTool 3 for $99 from FontLab (www.fontlab.com).
    The documentation should be sufficient to help you make the fonts yourself since
    you can already do the art. There is a demo version you can download from the
    same page and try before you buy to help you make a decision."

    body: "thanks for the advice.  it seems like the Typetool option would be reasonable
      for me to try and then see what comes of it.\r\n\r\nassuming the copyrights
      were clear, is there money to be made from selling the fonts, after haveing
      them professionally 'finished'?  they seem very appealing to me, but there are
      SO many fonts out there.  have you had any success with that?"

    if it only took $99 to be able to make good fonts many of us would be in serious

    course it's pretty impossible to predict retail performance. But in any case it's
    rarely significant money, unless it's exceptional in some way. You could show
    it around to gauge interest, but if the source is easy to obtain you'd be risking
    copy-cats.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
