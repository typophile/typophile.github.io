  this.\r\nA company that came through on my phone as Digital Type Sol just called
  - they have a special on SuperType... wahooo! LOL\r\n\r\nIt was a kid - who had
  no idea about typefaces, didn't know his PC was an IBM clone - and... didn't know
  what a .ttf was - but he was selling them -- a whole graphic package...\r\n\r\nOh
  boy - he also let me know that they had a whole graphic arts team creating these
  \"Super Fonts\" - all original (yeah, sure...)\r\n\r\nThe last time I heard from
  these folks they had introduced Font Expert 3 -- of which they were in shock that
  I owned #2. Then it came with a Super Font collection that seemed to be Brown Fox
  repackaged... oh well. \r\n\r\nThanks for listening..."
