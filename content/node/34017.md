  rounded edges.\r\n\r\nthanks for your help.\r\n\r\nedit: I attached another image
  of the font, but in this one it's been modified. It may be still possible to tell
  what it is by its outline??\r\n\r\n"

    Black</a>? Quite hard to tell at that size.\r\n\r\nAre you sure your two samples
    are the same font?"
