  page of my site, along with the logo at center.\r\n\r\nThe site will feature a few
  different portfolios in copywriting, layout & design, photography, vocal work, etc,
  so I didn't want anything overcomplicated.  \r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\nhttp://coleunlimited.com\r\n"

  body: "My only concern is that lower-left/upper-right arrangement leaves the reader
    of the logo with no clear signal as to which letter comes first. Normally top
    or left have precedence (in Latin-based languages, at least). Size or color can
    also give a clue here. Yours does not have any of these clues. So half the people
    will be reading UC and half will be reading CU. \r\n\r\nAre you okay with that?"

  body: Those were my concerns as well.  I think it's mitigated by a) no one I've
    showed it to reads it any other way but C-U; b) making the U a subscript makes
    the C look like a G; and c) Louis Vuiton's (sp?) logo is not far off, in a similar
    arrangement.
