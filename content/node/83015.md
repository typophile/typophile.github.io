  typography extravaganza taking place in New Orleans, July 5-10. If you've never
  gone, TypeCon is a blast and very inspiring. Half the fun is meeting up with people
  you're interacting with daily on Typophile. You'll be glad you went! Full details
  here: http://www.typecon.com/program.\r\n\r\nWhich speaker/event are you most looking
  forward to?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    gone. Seems sort of dull to me.\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to seeing Ed Benguiat.
    He is the only person I have ever met who pronounces my Sicilian last name like
    it was Jewish."
