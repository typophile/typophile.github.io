    Frutiger Arabic would work good also and it's a really nice Arabic \"Sans Serif\"\r\n\r\nAlso
    Tarek Atrissi has this geometric font that's really cool I don't know if it's
    available for licensing, I guess you can contact him about it if you like it.\r\n[[http://www.atrissi.com/index.php?pageID=14]]
    The one that's white on red. (that's why I don't like Flash Websites :P)\r\n\r\n"
