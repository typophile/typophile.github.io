body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm desperately seeking the name of this typeface.\r\n\r\nIt is
  used in some of the printed materials for T2 (the tea company) and is featured on
  the website for SAE Creative (http://www.saecreative.com.au/). Please forgive the
  subtleties in the attached images, this typeface is used for animated sections that
  fade in and out, so it is virtually impossible to screen-capture them with any clarity.
  Please see the link to the SAE Creative website to see the typeface in action. The
  1 in particular is very distinctive (see contact page on the SAE website, or second
  attached image).\r\n\r\nWould be so appreciative of any help.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"
