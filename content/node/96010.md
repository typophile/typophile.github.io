    was it set in a really wide font? Anyway if you remember seeing Jim in that shirt
    I guess I'm set - thanks!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant,\r\n\r\nWhat you are seeing is distortion from a wide-angle lens: it
    tends to be most noticeable at the peripheries. Jim is probably not as wide as
    he appears in the photo, either\u2026"

  body: Technically speaking, that effect is not called "distortion". It is caused
    by looking at the picture from too far away - the angle the picture makes to your
    eye should be the same as the angle the scene made to the camera.

  body: "John,\r\n\r\nSorry: if it's not distortion, what is it? Based on the 35mm
    film format, a \"normal\" focal length of around 55mm is supposed to mimic what
    the human eye actually sees\u2014although, typically, portrait lenses have focal
    lengths of 70-85mm. The referenced photo appears to have a focal length of 30-40mm,
    I am guessing, which means that objects in the periphery will be \"misrepresented\"
    to the eye, and actual photographs make this \"misrepresentation\" apparent."

  body: I'm not sure if the effect has a name, but in optics, distortion is a technical
    term for what a fisheye lens would have done instead.
