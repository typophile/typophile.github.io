body: Hi <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for some new suggestions for a clear, legible and
  flexible typeface for a television channel, mainly to be used in TV and online medium.
  <BR> <BR>The font should reflect/support the channel&#39;s identity, which is personal,
  friendly and fresh, and somewhat hip/cool/ipod too. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'I think there has been discussion on these boards about how type renders
    on television; do a search and you probably will find stuff helpful.  <BR> <BR>I
    would also compare <a href="http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locator/index.html"
    target="_blank"> Locator</a>. With its wide and stylish upper case it might work
    well for small sizes. The lower case of Clearview would probably work better though,
    at small sizes. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if Amplitude&#39;s traps would help
    render on TV, but you might check this out.  <BR> <BR>I am partial to Christian
    Schwartz&#39;s work - Simian text and Amplitude because it mangages to look stylish
    without being weird. Locator is there too. &#40;The display of both Simian and
    Locator are too odd in my opinion for regular use.&#41; <BR> <BR>CNN&#39;s US
    nightly news &#40;10 eastern&#41; uses Meta successfully, and the News Hour on
    PBS has used Optima for years and it looks very classy. I guess is a lot in how
    the type will be used, and the mood you want to convey. '

  body: 'I would think that Clearview would be more legible at small sizes than Tiresias.
    Compare for example their g&#39;s the descender is much closer to the bowl on
    Tiresias and would close up more quickly as you go to small sizes, no?  <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t know how hinting etc applies to TV, and this might be a critical factor
    in choosing.  <BR> <BR>By the way, does it have to be a sans? For example PMN
    Caecilia, with sturdy serifs should work.  <BR> <BR>Oh I just remembered - check
    out the new Monitor at <a href="http://www.ourtype.com" target="_blank">www.ourtype.com</a>

- body: Do any of those really say &#34;friendly&#34; and &#34;personal&#34;? I think
    sans faces are probably easier to make hip &amp; cool, but the color might have
    to be a really large part of the identity if you wanted to push them in another
    direction. Maybe one of the softer sans faces would work...? I do think the italics
    in Locator are friendly, and still cool. Or maybe by personal you just mean unique?
    To me friendly would be something serif.

    target="_blank">http://www.letterror.com/foundry/critter/index.html</a> <BR> <BR>Try
    that little &#40;LTR&#41; Critter. <BR> <BR>I do graphics for telly for a living,
    so here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learnt: <BR> <BR>1: Avoid fonts with thin horizontal
    lines - they will flicker like crazy on a television screen due to interlacing.
    <BR> <BR>2: Pick fonts with a large x-height - that will allow you to experiment
    with smaller sizes but remain readable. <BR> <BR>3: &#40;Assuming a nominal resolution
    of 72pt&#41; Dont use a font smaller than 18pt ever ever, and try and keep to
    above 21pt as much as possible. <BR> <BR>4: Dont use finely seriffed fonts - the
    serifs will break down on screen unless they&#39;re set massive. Slab or wedge
    serifs are cool though - experiment. <BR> <BR>5: For static screens, gaussian
    blur the end screen by &#34;0.3&#34; in Photoshop: this will help with flickering.
    <BR> <BR>6: Be careful of red type, especially if its highly saturated. View your
    designs on a television or a broadcast monitor to be sure. <BR> <BR>7: This is
    where people may disagree with me: Be wary of chunky fonts at smaller sizes, they
    can appear to fill in a little, much like print on newspaper. <BR>'
