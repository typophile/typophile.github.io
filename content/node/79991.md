  body: Common Things is a looser version of the kind of lettering used on billheads
    and letterheads at that time. [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/|Letterhead Fonts]]
    might have something with a similar appeal to you, especially [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/billhead.php|LHF
    Billhead]], or the [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/coffee+bin/fonts/|Coffee Bin
    fonts]] at MyFonts, although they have a more precise, engraved look than the
    drawn lettering on the book jacket.
