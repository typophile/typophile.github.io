  body: "Welcome Alex! I like how clean it looks, the rounded corners, and the pattern
    in a corner. I don't think the all-lowercase sans works with the company name.
    My suggestion is to try some different combinations with the text--All caps name,
    small caps tagline,  title case tagline, etc. The tagline also seems too small
    for the title...maybe a larger size in a condensed font? The L looks heavier than
    the other letters. Hope that helps :)\r\n\r\nEron"

  body: I like them, very nice feel to them. Id say experiment with the tagline. Apart
    from that, I think its all good.

    there. The font for the tag line still isn't looking quite right. What condensed
    font would you suggest eron s??\r\n\r\nCheers A."

  body: I wonder if a condensed would cause the tag to be too dominant. Anyway, you
    might look at another Storm type, John Sans. It does have a condensed and several
    weights to work with. Might be worth a look.
