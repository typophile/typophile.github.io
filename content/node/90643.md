  Force performing jazz tunes. The record is from the 70's to early 80's - I wouldn't
  expect the font to be any newer than 1984.\r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/crystalgardens_font_invert_6457.jpg]"

    There were two weights, light and bold. This one is Opulent Light. I don''t know
    of a digital version.'

  body: There were several alternates for most letters. Not very well drawn, in my
    opinion.

    of anything very similar?\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: "FYI, Opulent is credited to <a href=\"http://typographica.org/on-typography/interview-phil-martin/\">Phil
    Martin</a> (the guy who started Alphabet Innovations and TypeSpectra). However,
    after Phil died in 2005, I heard from one of his former associates who said that
    some faces that Phil took credit for were actually designed and/or drawn by others
    in his employ. He stated that Opulent actually may have been designed by George
    Bain, or that he at least drew it.\r\n\r\n"
