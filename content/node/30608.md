body: Can they be used for design work if they are legally downloaded? What about
  for commercial and business purposes? It says FREE next to it but some others have
  FREE FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY. This one says just FREE. What do you think. Please help.

  body: "While EULAs vary widely, many dingbat/picture fonts come with the added stipulation
    that the characters from the font may not be incorporated into logo designs, since
    basically each character is already a logo design.\r\n\r\n\"Free for personal
    use\" often comes up in the context of free fonts. You can use them for your personal
    correspondence, student  and home projects, but not in works repersenting a commercial
    entity without buying a supplemental license from the foundry. If the included
    license only says it is \"free\" without specifying  limits on its use, then there
    are no limits on its use. \r\n\r\nWhen in doubt, ask the person who made it."
