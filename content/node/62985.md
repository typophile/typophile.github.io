body: "I created a document to start cataloging all of the drills I may use in practice
  for my own reference and to spread knowledge to better the sport of water polo.
  I would love most of all tips for setting up my file in Adobe In Design to make
  this process easier as well as general tips on my design and layout and typography.\r\n\r\nHere
  is the pdf:\r\nhttp://www.norcalwaterpolo.com/downloads/wpb_401.pdf\r\n\r\nI can
  also post up the indesign files if someone can give me tips on setting up my files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-Jesse"

  body: "lots to comb through but something that stands out immediately is the forced
    justification, it makes the text too airy and with the sans serif font and depth
    of information *pardon the pun* it makes it hard to read and digest.\r\n\r\nalso
    consider limiting the use of the // as a separator, try the bullet instead \u2022
    alt 0149 on pc, option 8 on mac.\r\n\r\nalso i think some clever and occasional
    usage of line drawings or illustrations could spruce up the layout and break it
    up so it doesn't seem so type-dense. also the thick line above the side headers
    makes the page feel heavy to the left. try to extend a thinner line, 2 pt across
    or halfway at least over the top of the first line of the section. \r\n\r\nthe
    whole document looks a bit like a resume so some subtle character and 'breaking
    up the boxes' so to speak will go a long way.\r\n\r\nalso to change it slightly
    ... how about some historical nuggets or waterpolo records as inset callout boxes
    like you'd see a pull quote in a magazine formatted.\r\n\r\nthanks for sharing
    it with us and good luck.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of unbridled creativity,\r\n\r\nTroy

  body: "Awesome, Thank you Troy! \r\n\r\nI will try it without forced justification,
    bullets, and a 2 pt separator. I plan on adding line drawings and rewriting most
    of the drills for the layman as well as including a glossary. That is a good idea
    about the quotes! \r\n\r\nThis is only 1 part of a larger document wherein I include
    fundamental concepts of the sport,team plays, coaching philosophies, etc."
