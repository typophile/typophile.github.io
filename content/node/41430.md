body: "from the website:\r\nOn December 17, 1987, we formed the Tokyo Type Directors
  Club (Tokyo TDC) to realize our vision, which was to firmly establish the field
  of \"typedirection.\" This discipline would involve extensive and deep searches
  into the visual expressions of letters, going far beyond conventional character
  designing. The primary activities of our club include an annual international design
  competition, the publication of the yearbook and the production of exhibitions.
  Embracing free-flowing ideas, flexible rules and a perceptive eye for quality, we
  hope to continue to provide an environment that inspires and nurtures new artistic
  energy.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.tdctokyo.org/index_e.html"
