  created a logo in photoshop. The logo is on a transparent background. I recently
  found this and wanted to use it in indesign. if i imported in to indesign the transperancy
  looks fine on scree.. but when i print it.. its a translucent white box.. ive gotten
  solid white boxes before due to transperancy but never a translucent white box.
  \ \r\n\r\nany ideas and how to resolve this problem?"

    converting PSDs to PNGs and placing them. For later, try making logos in a program
    more suited to making logos.

    actually it's the transparency flattening that causes the strange boxes. Always
    check the Transparency Flattener Preview in InDesign if you are working with transparency,
    to see any problems. Also I think RIPs find it very difficult to handle transparency
    flattening properly. \r\n\r\nUsually when I use transparency in a document, I
    tell the prepress/printers that I use it and where, and that they need to pay
    attention when outputting my file because of it.\r\n\r\nSomehow I remember reading
    somewhere that it might also be somewhat buggy handling of transparency of the
    Adobe Suite?"

    web, not for prepress.\r\nPSD and TIFF are the best choice for prepress documents.
    \r\n\r\nMake sure to use a consistent color space. Is your PSD converted to CMYK?
    Is your InDesign workspace CMYK? Do you export the PDF in CMYK?\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nI\u2019ve
    had trouble with transparency in Adobe software all the time. Well, actually it\u2019s
    the transparency flattening that causes the strange boxes.\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nThe
    white lines in Acrobat are just a problem of screen resolution.\r\nIf you see
    color changes around a transparent image, you have most likely mixed different
    color spaces. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite> Also I think RIPs find it very difficult
    to handle transparency flattening properly.\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's why you should
    flatten the PDF in InDesign by choosing PDF 1.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nSomehow
    I remember reading somewhere that it might also be somewhat buggy handling of
    transparency of the Adobe Suite?\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nNo, if you know what you are
    doing it works just great with all the Adobe apps.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n"

    to have some trouble when printing, but I have used some of the tips from the
    video I posted above your post, and that helps a lot. I've noticed that checking
    the Flattener Preview in InDesign and then use proper layering of your document
    eliminates a lot of the white-box problems.\r\n\r\nJose could also try to make
    a clipping path in photoshop around the logo, instead of a transparent background,
    and then place it in InDesign and let it clip the image with the embedded clipping
    path."
