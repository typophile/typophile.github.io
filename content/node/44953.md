  have to pick a typeface for vinyl lettering to go in a street-facing window. The
  art area is huge \u2014 about 6 feet by very tall \u2014 but the sentence has to
  be readable on the sidewalk and I don't know, across the street?\r\n\r\nThe sentences,
  about one each per window, are memories about the history of an area in the city,
  winning contest submissions. They'll also be part of an inside exhibit, and later
  a book. So history, first person voices, collective memory, lyric-poetry type stuff.\r\n\r\nI
  like the feel of Filosofia and Mrs Eaves italics for this, even ITC Century roman
  \u2014 but the first 2 are definitely not strong enough for across the street viewing.
  I need something strong and quirky. With multiple weights?\r\n\r\nSuggestions?"

    inside the window, and that was extremely strong. Set in Helvetica, but its originality
    came from the fact that was an a 3d object\r\n\r\n-Rafe"

    doubt successful using it.\r\n\r\nI saw a window installation I liked the other
    day,  the whole window was frosted glass and the type itself was left clear with
    a lot of negative space around it. Similar dimensions to your's as well, 6x6 Feet
    and the text was set in about 900pt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    been designed to be legible in very small sizes, which should help the text being
    readable, even from across the street. <em>(For example the fabulous 'Freight

  body: The typefaces suggested so far are rather unconventional for signage (which
    isn't necessarily a bad thing), but for the more traditional style of signage/wayfinding
    type, check out <a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/38424>this thread</a>, <a

  body: "Something slightly condensed with a large x-height is going to work in your
    favor. Consider the average height of a viewer/cars and other obstructions and
    placement/visibility above this level, contrast of the color in relation to the
    coatings/color of the glass and how the color of the glass can change based on
    viewing position. Sometimes a pearlized reflective vinyl can shift from neg. to
    reverse as the sun sets and the environment changes.\r\n\r\nFolowing Dave's direction,
    you could look at Lucida Fax. I've used Apex new in a similar situation, but I
    was following the lead of an existing book design."

  body: I don't know about Mrs. Eaves. On one hand, the letters look really cool,
    but on the other, it has pretty extreme overshoots that might start to look weird
    at that scale. Definitely test it with a full-size tiled printout first.

    the letters. So when people pass by the window -- they can read it.

  body: "As someone who plots and weeds vinyl lettering, please go for a nice sans
    like Gotham or Trade Gothic. A serif like Freight Micro in a bold weight would
    work if you are doing something in the 200-300 point range.\r\n\r\nJust please
    avoid a Didot-like face. Those ultra delicate serifs are a bitch, even at large

    or Trade Gothic is they don't relate to the content in any way. But I hear you

    is a quote by M.J. Florczak\r\n\r\n1. Should there not be periods after the M

    Grant whose middle name was S - no punctuation needed?\r\n2. Since this is a quote
    - should we have quote marks around it?\r\n3. Since MJ is the source - it should
    be a 1/m dash - with no space between the 1/m and the MJ\r\n\r\nand while I'm
    on it - since the second line has all that white space, it should be alright to
    move the source of the quote up one line. If this is large for display, and you
    want to fill three lines, I'd like to recommend then centering the source. Just
    a design thing.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it's done! And fine! And probably hanging up

    about my choices will make sense seeing it in place. But some of the typographic
    things are also style decisions, yes? Like APA and MLA; no periods after initials
    are a decision to stick to out of a need for fewer extraneous bits. \r\n\r\nto
