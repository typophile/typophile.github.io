  body: As the script is quite irregular and not so well done (technically speaking)
    it's possible this is either a custom job or a freeware/shareware font. As there
    are a gazillion of those out there it will be quite tricky to nail it. :^/

    body: Thanks. I thought it might be a scanned / modified "real" typeface.

  body: Wow only one repeating character and the angles of the y compared to the P
    and other characters lead me to suggest custom. Not many designers change angles
    of their characters.
