body: Our magazine uses an allcaps cutline style and recently the copy chief has requested
  some clarification on the proper setting of a name like MCCARTNEY in a cutline.
  It looks odd to my eye, but setting it as McCARTNEY opens up the door to all sorts
  of questions like how to do "d'Yquem", for example. D'YQUEM or d'YQUEM? DEL VERDE
  or Del VERDE. Thanks in advance.

  body: What about using small caps? Wouldn't be that much of a diff in a name like
    McCartney but anything like MacDonald or DiGiacomandrea would retain a more "cappy"
    personality.

  body: That's a tough call there. Maybe compromise and use a small cap in those situations?
