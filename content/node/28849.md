    body: Yes but it's a derivative. Some letters are different, particularly 'a'
      and 'g'. Also notice the spurs of 'r', 'm' and 'b' are asymmetrical.

      725</a>, but it too is not an exact match.\r\n\r\nThis typeface--so similar
      to Akzidenz, but not quite it--has dogged me for years. I have a  similar reaction

    body: "I think I found a pre-digital sample of this very typeface (on Typophile,
      no less!). Check this image out. It was called Akzidenz-Grotesk halbfett:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/AG5.jpg\r\n\r\nThis
      specimen was posted here in the forums, and it's worth reading the fascinating
      <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/17643\">discussion of Akzidenz</a> that
      surrounds it. \r\n\r\nThis still doesn't answer the question of where the digital
      version is coming from."
