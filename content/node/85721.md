  some suggestions about good/deep/critical introductions to Chinese and Arabic calligraphy,
  in a comparative perspective,and also about the relationship between calligraphy
  and typography in the West. So far I have only found one book in a comparative perspective
  (dealing with the three traditions).\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: "There are a <em>lot</em> of books on Arabic calligraphy. [Note that \u2018Islamic
    calligraphy\u2019 is a better term, since many of the greatest works belong to
    the Persian and Ottoman traditions, and the culture of calligraphy in Islam covers
    a much larger ethnic base than just the Arabs, although Arabic is the language
    of much of the text for religious reasons.]\r\n\r\nMohamed Zakariya's monograph
    <em>The Calligraphy of Islam: reflections on the state of the art</em> is the
    only work I know of on Arabic calligraphy, in English, that accurately identifies
    all the classical styles (including the less common ones). Other books either
    have at least some errors or omit or conflate styles.\r\n\r\nSheila Blair's <em>Islamic
    Calligraphy</em> is the most thorough scholarly work in English, I believe."
