  seems to know this one and it's been bugging me forever. Any ideas? The book was
  published in 1969.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ef6067e743c874945d3654a58214d545_4719.36656.jpeg]"

    body: "Indeed. The particular printing of the book that I scanned this from has
      a pretty low production quality in general. Regardless, some of these characters
      are pretty distinct and should be easily recognizable if you are familiar with
      the typeface (which, unfortunately, I am not).\r\n\r\nI am thoroughly convinced
      that it is indeed a typeface though, and not handlettering (I've even gone to
      the length of doing overlay comparisons of the duplicate letters to check for
      consistency)."

  body: If you consider this being x-number of generations away from the original,
    I might guess Perpetua.

  body: "Just out of curiosity, how do typefaces like this become eroded? I imagine
    it's got something to do wth working with copies instead of masters but I'm unsure
    of the details. I really like the uniform way it's eroded, not so much the subject
    matter of the book... \r\n\r\n--N"

      second thought, maybe not... he did do a lot of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gill#Sexuality
      target=_blank>stuff</a> that might be more easily considered in line with LaVeyan
      Satanism than with Catholicism!\r\n\r\nIt definitely has a Gill flavor to it
      (I had originally looked at <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/golden-cockerel/
      target=_blank>Golden Cockerel</a>). Up until now, Perpetua / Lapidary are the
      closest things I've seen, but none of the digital versions quite cut it, even
      with the changes from erosion considered.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's just a pre-digital
      version that was forsaken at the cross of analog and digital technologies.  Anyone
      have a pre-1969 type specimen book with a matching version of Perpetua?"

  body: "Lapidary Bitstream's version of Perpetua, but I can see some differences.
    Specifally the lowercase-b has more of a curve in the base which matches more
    closely the cover. Could be a better match.\r\n\r\nThe \"erosion\" happens when
    they duplicate the artwork multiples times. It is similar to what happens when
    you scan a transparency, output that to paper, scan the print and then output
    that to film. You 4 generations away from the original."

    having sex with animals is a total no-go in LaVey's Satanism. LaVey was pretty
    free-for-all as long as there was consent. Animals cannot give consent, therefore
    bestiality is not approved...\r\n\r\nFucking your kids is a no-go as well... \"Satanism
    does not advocate rape, child molesting, sexual defilement of animals, or any
    other form of sexual activity which entails the participation of those who are
    unwilling or whose innocence or naivete would allow them to be intimidated or
    misguided into doing something against their wishes.\" - The Satanic Bible, pg
    70.\r\n\r\nConsidering the rampant pedophilia, animal abuse, etc. etc. that has
    been a staple of Catholicism, I'd say he fit right in."
