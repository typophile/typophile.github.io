body: "in FL 5.1 when you generate a font whiteout copyright info (a beta version,
  for example) the new FL 5.1 will attribute your font to Adobe.\r\nAdding this into
  your copyright: \"Copyright 2012 Adobe Systems Incorporated. All rights reserved.\"\r\nAnd
  this into your trademark: Please refer to the Copyright section for the font trademark
  attribution notices.\r\nNot Good.\r\n\r\nAlso, in some case, it will \"replace\"
  your own copyright data.\r\nWorst.\r\n\r\nThe old FL 5.0 used to say \"Generated
  in 2012 by FontLab Studio. Copyright info pending.\"\r\n"

  body: "That was equally true in FontLab 5.0.0 et.seq.  It has always put in the
    Adobe \xA9 notice if you generate an .otf font without having your own copyright
    text. \r\n\r\nThis is because of the Adobe components in FontLab's internal open
    type generation software. Personally, I've neither seen the \"Generated ... by
    FontLab\" appear in FL 5+ nor seen it replace the \xA9 data.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: "FontLab uses the Adobe FDK for OpenType (AFDKO) to generate OpenType fonts.
    It contains all kinds of defaults for things if you don't set them explicitly.
    Same thing happens if you were to use AFDKO from the command line with a bunch
    of text files and .pfbs and left out your copyright string.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind,
    these tools were written for internal use at Adobe originally. Releasing them
    for other people to use came later."

  body: "Yep, AFDKO, that was my guess. But anyway.. attributing your own work to
    another company it's not nice. I was a bit surprised the first time I saw it.\r\nMaybe
    they can fix it for future releases."

    at the start.

  body: "Yep, of course I will. \r\nBut still... it's a bad new default copyright
    notice.\r\n\"Generated in XXXX by FontLab Studio. Copyright info pending.\" was
    much better."
