  body: You have one name backwards. Egyptian 505 Light is the original Linotype name,
    not Egyptios Light.

  body: "Continued Loonacy   (Spelling Intentional)\r\n\r\nHere is my best guess as
    to which fonts are missing from the Looney Tunes Font Pack font list, based on
    the samples shown in the image I uploaded, and fonts supplied in other packs:\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Incised 901 Bold (Antique Olive Bold),\r\n(mixed with \"Looney Tunes\") for \"Employee\"
    etc.,\r\n\r\nAlso, this font is a match for the letterforms used in the Looney
    Tunes font, and could possibly have been renamed to Looney Bold for the font pack.\r\n\r\nFrom
    the scanned image, I believe I see: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Freehand 471 (Cascade Script)
    \r\n\r\nfor \"Awards Banquet\" (partially shown title),\r\n\r\nand (this was difficult
    to make out at such a low resolution):\r\n\r\n\u2022 Aachen\r\n\r\n (all in caps
    with spaces between each letter) for \"Fax Transmittal\".\r\n\r\n\u2022 This leaves
    one font missing from this list, as a 1993 Bitstream press release indicates that
    there are six fonts in this pack.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows if this is correct or
    not, please let me know.  \r\n\r\nScans of the user guide would be extremely helpful
    and greatly appreciated.  At least: the front cover,  the pages from \"Let's Get
    Started\" thru \"Selecting a Point Size\" and the back of the box, especially.\r\n\r\nI
    have been searching for some time and can find very little mention of the Looney
    Tunes 1 Font Pack online.  It was practically miraculous that I was able to purchase
    a copy online of the Jetsons Font Pack, which had an AD flyer inside that had
    a tiny photo of the Looney Tunes box front.\r\n\r\nA few mysteries remain (if
    I am thus far correct):\r\nWhich font was considered as used in the \"Sylvester
    Logo\"?\r\nWhich font was considered as used in the \"Elmer Fudd Logo\"?\r\nAre
    one of those two the missing font?\r\n"

  body: " I would like to re-iterate my plea for information regarding the \"Looney
    Tunes 1 Font Pack\" made by Bitstream,, Inc. in the early '90s.  \r\n\r\nIf anyone
    out there can add to the information I have already gathered, please post it here.
    \ \r\n\r\nIf you know a former Bitstream employee, \r\nperhaps you can see if
    they are able to help.  \r\n\r\nAn alternative solution would be possible if someone
    has this pack:  \r\nA scan of the back of the box would be extremely helpful.
    \ \r\nA scan of certain parts of the user guide would complete my task.  \r\n\r\nAny
    assistance would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n"
