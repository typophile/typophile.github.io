  is a monospaced font from a thermal receipt printer. The problem is that I don't
  know the name of the manufactuer of the printer, nothing is wroten on the machine
  !\r\n\r\nSpecial attention should be focused on:\r\n\r\n- capital-letter A, small-letter
  a\r\n- capital-letter G\r\n- capital-letter I, small-letter i\r\n- number 1, number
  4, number 7\r\n\r\nThank you !"

  body: "As I understand it, these 'fonts' are not digital fonts as you have on your
    computer. They are built into the printer either with circuitry or firmware, which
    is not accessible by the user.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone else can speak with more authority
    about this, but the main point is that I do not think this is a font the way we
    usually speak of them.\r\n\r\nWith all that said, you may be able to find fonts
    that try to replicate this look. FontFont calls these 'ironic' fonts, because
    they try to imitate non-digital type, such as dot matrix printers or hand-stamps.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Alright, in case other people wonder about provenience of the above font...\r\n\r\nWell...
    there is a thermic printer of model <em>TTP 2000</em>, manufactured by Zebra consortium.\r\n\r\nThe
    name of that font-family is <em>ATM9 (Monospaced 14.4 cpi)</em>\r\n\r\nAll that
    I can do is use a vector-editing program such as Adobe Illustrator or CorelDraw
    and start creating each shape/letter/character in that font and then use a TTF-font
    program to merge together all the shapes/letter/characters created with the vector
    program, and the result is gonna be a .ttf file.\r\n\r\nUchh, what a time consuming
    task !"
