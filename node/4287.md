body: See attachment &#40;red arrow&#41;. The default for a colon spit out by Illustrator
  just doesn&#39;t look right. Do I leave as is or manually adjust? <BR> <BR><img

- body: I&#39;m guessing it looks off because colons are generally used with lowercase
    letters. It&#39;s probably nothing that illustrator is doing. <BR>When used in
    all caps, or with &#39;uppercase&#39; numbers, I think it can look better if the
    colon is raised slightly, but I&#39;m not sure what the &#39;rules&#39; are. In
    lowercase, it sits on the baseline, as far as I know. <BR>In the 1800 number,
    the hyphens should be raised to match the x-height. &#40;same idea, sorta. Someone
    correct me if I&#39;m wrong...&#41;

  body: I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to blame Illustrator. After all, it can only do
    what the font tells it to do. What is the font? <BR> <BR>;&#41;

  body: I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to &#39;adjust.&#39; To my knowledge the colon
    is merely a dotted period, just as the semicolon is a dotted comma, and should
    indeed rest on the baseline.
