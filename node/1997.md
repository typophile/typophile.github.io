body: Hi, <BR>Im looking for a way to put a newspaper print effect &#40;B/W&#41; on
  an image. Im guessing there must be a filter/plug-in out there, would anybody recommend
  one? <BR>And similarly, would anyone know what program or filter was used to create
  the cover for eye no.44 &#40;an image of the queen made up of circles&#41;. <BR>
  <BR>Thanks in advance, <BR>David.

    you could scan an image or part of an image and post it, Dan

  body: Are you talking about a halftone? That&#39;s a natural process of printing
    with a low line-screen. You can also use the halftone filters in Photoshop to
    fake it on a higher resolution printer.

  body: David, <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re referring to replicating the look of newsprint
    fibers, it&#39;s much easier to scan in a real newspaper and photoshop the fibers
    into a uniform background, then multiply the image over top. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re
    referring to the subtle distress that comes from light ink coverage on cheap newsprint
    paper ran at high speeds, I&#39;ve got just the thing for you . . . <BR> <BR>In
    a few weeks I plan to launch a series of photoshop filters that do just what you&#39;re
    describing. I will make a post to the list when they are ready for consumer consumption.
    <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Stuart :D

  body: '1&#41; That&#39;s an extreme example. It&#39;s from Armenia, where the money
    is very tight these days, so type fidelity -especially in newspapers- is very
    low. The typical low-print-quality Western paper looks more like this: <BR> <BR><img

    <BR> <BR>2&#41; I don&#39;t know if horizontals gain more than verticals <i>as
    a rule</i>. But it could be, because of the cylinder press direction, and maybe
    the paper too. <BR> <BR>3&#41; In the Armenian sample the callendaring of the
    paper &#40;at least I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called&#41; has a strong
    effect. <BR> <BR>4&#41; There&#39;s a hard-to-find article by Beatrice Warde in
    a publication called &#34;Bowater Papers&#34; &#40;#3, 1954, from page 42&#41;
    that shows many great examples of fidelity loss. I have a copy, but it&#39;s pretty
    bad quality itself! <BR> <BR>5&#41; There&#39;s an article by Philip Gaskell in
    issue #7 &#40;1971&#41; of the Journal of the Printing Historical Society called
    &#34;Photographic Enlargements of Type Forms&#34; &#40;pp 51-53, but with 8 plates&#41;
    with really superb close-ups of many classic fonts, printed optimally &#40;as
    you can still see the gain&#41;. I have an original of that. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Fine... far as I can see, thin strokes tend to gain more than thick ones,
    also notticed vertical compression between the original and the printed, is this
    digital or print effect? <BR> <BR>I

  body: David, you can scan in a blank sheet of newsprint for the texture and overlay,
    as Stuart mentioned. <BR>Then use the Diffuse filter in photoshop once or twice
    and fiddle with the opacity. <BR> <BR>Stuart, looking forward to seeing your new
    stuff soon. <BR> <BR>bj
