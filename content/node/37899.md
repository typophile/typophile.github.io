  I have to track down a copy of the book if only to find out what \"Bottle-arsed
  type\" is. :-) \r\n"

    \"bottle-ASSED type.\"\r\n\r\nEven the best Monotype caster operators could not
    always avoid casting some bottle-assed/arsed type. I worked with some of the best,
    and I had to send ribbons back to the casting room to have type re-cast more often
    than I would have liked.\r\n\r\nI never operated a Monotype caster, so I cannot
    give a good explanation about why type may come out of the mold wider at the bottom
    than at the top. But it does at times, and then it is a terrible nuisance for
    the compositor at the bank who has to make pages of this type. & if any bottle-assed
    type got sent to the pressroom it was equally nasty for stonehand and pressman.\r\n\r\nIf
    you have ever set even a few lines of metal type by hand, you can appreciate how
    important it is that all sorts be of the same dimensions top and bottom. Justifying
    the type, filling the line, or locking it up will be quite difficult.\r\n\r\nSearch
    for \"bottle assed\" instead of \"bottle-arsed\" and you will get a few more bits
    of info.\r\n\r\ni hope I never see a line of this stuff again.\r\n\r\npowers"
