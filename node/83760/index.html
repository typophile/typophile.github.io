<p>I had a day off recently and nothing better to do than hack the Apple Color Emoji font from the iPhone. I figured out the »sbix« table format and extended the Python FontTools so that I was able to decompile the table and extract the glyph images. The PNGs are in a different format than usual, supposedly to be rendered faster on the iPhone&rsquo;s processor, but I found a Python script that converts them to the standard PNG format.</p>
<p>BTW anybody could do that with a little web research and general knowledge about font formats, no Apple-specific insider knowledge required, let alone NDAs ;)</p>
<p>I think if Apple want to extend the support for this to more and different devices, with different resolutions, a vector-based approach would be better.</p>

<p>It seems really short-sighted and silly to keep pushing  svg, because all kinds of graphics effects perfectly possible in ttf or CFF  including simple stuff like contour and fill don&rsquo;t work with ttf on the web!?&hellip; Fonts and what one needs to know are just getting fatter, and not smarter, and by the time the inexperienced are through we will wonder why WOFF or sfnt are no being intelligently built on.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Personally, I think just because emoji pushed the boundary for text encoding &ndash; and you should have heard the arguments about that in Unicode circles! &ndash; that doesn&rsquo;t mean they <em>need</em> to push the boundary of what constitutes a font. There is no reason at all that text encoded characters need to be represented by glyphs in a font; they could just as easily be represented by any indexed collection of bitmaps, vector graphics or, for that matter, robots with spraycans.</p>
<p>I think there are acceptable reasons why we might want to be able to incorporate colour into fonts in future: mostly in display type, of course, but also for text in some scripts that have traditionally used multi-colour signs (Ethiopic is an obvious example) but have been unable to do so in typography. But rushing to a bitmap-in-font solution as Apple have done to solve a particular use case for emoji seems to me shortsighted in a way that makes Adam&rsquo;s tentative analysis of the SVG option really very thoughtful in comparison.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are, broadly, two approaches to standardisation. One is that you makes something and then try to get other people to accept it as a standard, on the basis of its technical merits an/or the basis of its implementation. The other is that you recognise a need for or a benefit to standardising something and you sit down and start spec&rsquo;ing a standard before you start making something.</p>
<p>Much of the mess that Web developers have to deal with is the fallout of a history of individual companies making things for their own &lsquo;constituencies&rsquo; (customers, user base), rather than creating and following standards. And that includes the mess that is cross-browser text rendering, which you have elsewhere suggested should be standardised rather than treated as an area of competition.</p>
<p>Adam doesn&rsquo;t have a constituency. Which suggests that he&rsquo;s going to look at ideas based on general benefit and technical merit rather than corporate advantage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not faulting Apple for rushing to market with a colour bitmap in font solution for emoji, which serves their constituency and keeps their phones in a competitive position. I&rsquo;m saying that a) there are use cases for coloured display of encoded characters that go beyond emoji, and b) a bitmap-in-font implementation doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good long-term basis for standardising support for such use cases. You said that SVG was ‘silly and shortsighted’, and I&rsquo;m saying that colour bitmaps is shortsighted.</p>
<p>Specifically, you said that pushing SVG was silly and shortsighted in light of the problems we already have with TTF rendering on the web. But that doesn&rsquo;t follow, because while TTF rendering has been treated as an area of competition, and hence of differentiation and non-standardisation, by OS and browser makers, SVG is a Web standards project, and there is better chance of getting cross-browser compatibility in SVG rendering that there is in TTF rendering. Note that this is <em>not</em> to suggest that SVG can replace TTF as the text font format of choice for the Web, but that the rendering problems of TTF are independent of whatever might be done with SVG. So it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me to criticise SVG on the basis of what doesn&rsquo;t work in TTF on the Web.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A few remarks:</p>
<p>First, the discussion is not about SVG Fonts but about SFNT-based fonts (i.e. OpenType fonts) that include an SVG table for outline description.</p>
<p>Thinking <em>only</em> of SFNT-based fonts with glyf|CFF table <em>plus</em> SVG table (meant to <em>add</em> a handful of colored glyphs to otherwise black glyphs defined in the glyf|CFF table) is shortsighted. It makes things unnecessarily complicated, like aksing for an extra mechanism to replaces glyf|CFF-table glyphs by SVG-table glyphs.
That is, besides SFNT-based fonts with glyf|CFF table <em>plus</em> SVG table, <em>also</em> include SNFT-based fonts with <em>only</em> an SVG table in your scenario.* SVG-only SFNT-based fonts have a few advantages:
<em>–1–</em> Outline description can be in either cubic or quadratic bezier curves, which allows designers to choose and stick to their preferred format.
<em>–2–</em> And they can make a outline format choice without making an implicit choice between CFF or glyf table. SVG format is just some friendly text.
<em>–3–</em> If there is only one outline description table, GSUB and GPOS can – as with normal glyf/CFF-only fonts – kick in. You can design a full-color glyph set. You can design a mostly black glyph set and a few colored glyphs, and then use a Stylistic Set OTL feature to replace default black glyphs by colored alternate glyphs. You can design a mostly black glyph set and a few <em>encoded</em> glyphs in color (the emoji example) when these are colored by default.
(Ignoring what may or may not be considered disadvantages of the SVG format and/or its current support.)</p>
<p>The pixel vs outline discussion seems pointless. Each serves a purpose. Existence of Illustrator/Freehand did not render Photoshop useless, nor the other way round.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr Patel made an interesting remark on the OT List (9 July 2011), that an SVG-only SNFT-based font may need another version identifier. Which makes me wonder, though, why glyf|CFF-plus-SVG SNFT-based fonts are supposed to continue using 0x00010000 or OTTO version identifiers &hellip;</li>

<p>Fonts that also have glyf or CFF table are backwards compatible with existing font-consuming apps/OSes. So they can maintain the existing identifiers. Fonts that lack these existing tables would not be backwards compatible and would need a new identifier.</p>

<p>No, but Photoshop stores text and geometries internally as vector graphics. Yes, bitmaps and vectors each serve a purpose, but the purpose of scalable shapes is better served by vectors. Bitmaps are fine if all you need is a couple of discreet sizes for screen display at known resolutions, which is Apple&rsquo;s immediate situation with regard to emoji support, but I presume they would acknowledge that this doesn&rsquo;t constitute the whole picture of multicolour, scalable text.</p>
<hr>
<p>I agree with you completely re. sfnt fonts with SVG only. It makes no sense to spec SVG as a secondary glyph source that also <em>requires</em> a glyf or CFF table, although that configuration should be made possible. For fonts that have both SVG and another outline table type, I can imagine a dedicated cmap subformat pointing to the former for a subset of characters (an analogue would be the format 14 cmap for variation selector sequences). An SVG-sfnt savvy app could check this cmap first, and render any codepoints assigned in it using the SVG table, and then render any remaining characters using the next platform appropriate cmap.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thomas: This makes sense.</p>
<p>John: I didn&rsquo;t intend to start or contribute to a bitmap vs vector discussion; as a hint, I better remain silent about how useful I find Photo<em>Font</em>. As to glyf|CFF-plus-SVG fonts and glyph substitution/mapping, Mr Patel&rsquo;s original proposal offered a quite straightforward solution, and something similar was discussed on one of the W3 lists (1 July 2011). Both seem useful – if implemented as a separate table: Including the glyph substitution/mapping mechanism in the SVG table does not make sense because it is unnecessary in SVG-only fonts. I am not sure about including adding another subtable to cmap, for a similar reason: According to proposals so far, what is needed is mere GID to GID mapping rather than codepoint to GID mapping. And according to proposals so far, SVG-glyphs are meant to be alternates of glyphs covered in glyf/CFF, which suggests that an independent substitution/mapping table is the better choice, e.g. you could remove or add SVG table plus substitution/mapping table without need to dissect cmap.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Colour bitmaps are likely to be an adjunct format, just as embedded b/w and greyscale bitmaps are. The most likely <em>scalable</em> colour font implementation seems to be some form of the SVG-in-OT model. That currently has two draft forms, from <a href="http://dev.w3.org/SVG/modules/fonts/SVG-OpenType.html">Mozilla</a> and <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-svgopentype/2012Aug/att-0000/SVG_in_OpenType_WD_2012-08-07.pdf">Adobe</a>.

<p>Actually OpenType (as the Open Font Format) has been standardized through ISO, so members (not just Microsoft and Adobe) can decide if they support the Google proposal being part of the standard. Apple hasn&rsquo;t submitted their format for standardization AFAIK.</p>
