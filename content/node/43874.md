  Extol' and the right is 'Amerika Sans' (both 36 pt). The tagline script is 'Angelina'
  (20 pt).\r\n\r\nI did several alternatives, all differing only with the tagline
  text and script font. I have tried to keep the logo simple and uncluttered but the
  outline 'Typesource Extol'  may have destroyed this. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts on the
  mixture of the three fonts will be appreciated very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p116/readred_2007/tepidair.gif]]"

  body: "This will be harsh: this is a terrible mixture of three fonts.  I count logotype
    and tagline; you have one too many fonts.  Also, I don't have anything against
    free fonts (I used Coolvetica by Ray Larabie recently with a satisfactory result),
    but I'm getting the impression that you found three free fonts that you thought
    were cool and then gave them a role in your blog's header.\r\n\r\nFind a font
    that strongly expresses the content of your blog and then design a logotype using
    that.  If you have to pay for a font, then bite the bullet and shell out the cash.
    \ This is your brand you're developing here.  Actually, if you're investing the
    money, you may consider hiring a professional...\r\n\r\n---\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "Thank you for your reply, Nick. No, I don't think it's harsh, what I needed
    was an honest opinion and this is what I got. \r\n\r\nI've now used Helvetica
    at 12 pt for the tagline. Because the <em>first-choice</em> font in the blog is
    Helvetica, this will create a more cohesive page. I see now that it was a terrible
    mistake to use so many different fonts and the header now looks stronger on the
    page. \r\n\r\nThe identity I want my blog to express is that of one (a person)
    who doesn't want to be seen to 'blow his own trumpet' ('Bashful' in the 'Seven
    Dwarfs'). Hence the quasi derogatory title 'tepid air' and tagline.\r\n\r\n<em>As
    a rank amateur</em>, I feel the fonts \u2019Typesource Extol\u2019 and \u2019Amerika
    Sans\u2019 express this concept well and, hopefully, wittily.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate
    further thoughts on how well, if at all, this logotype now works. This is a link
    to the blog, [[http://tepidair.blogspot.com/]]\r\n\r\nWhile doing this 'design
    project' myself, I'm not trying to do it 'on the cheap' and I have no objection
    to buying fonts. If specific fonts are suggested, I certainly will consider using
    them."

    one. \r\n\r\nI like the shape of 'air' in Amerika Sans, and would appreciate thoughts
    on the suitability of the image and how it looks on the page at [[http://tepidair.blogspot.com/]]."
