    it\u2019s probably the most widely spread, which makes it the most probable candidate."

  body: "Jan, did you actually see  a difference between DejaVu and the others? The
    three fonts are all based on a Jim Lyles design, but which one is the original?
    Prima Serif also seems to match the posted sample, based on a quick test drive.
    It sounded to me like there could eventually be an unlimited number of fonts that
    look essentially the same, as their license terms allow anyone to use the design
    as long as they rename it?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
