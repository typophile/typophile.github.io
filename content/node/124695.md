body: "Could anyone possibly identify the following Cyrillic font used on RTS from
  approx. 1994 until 2000 ?\r\nThe letter \u0414 (D) and \u041B (L) has a notable
  characteristic round shape.    Font identification services don't work well or at
  all with Cyrillic fonts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen-Shot-2015-04-19-at-08_5123.34.48.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!"
