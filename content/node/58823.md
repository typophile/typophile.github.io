  body: "<em>A site that has English-Greenlandic-French text about a downloadable
    Greenlandic font</em>\r\n\r\nI'm afraid this isn't Greenlandic (Kalaallisut).
    There is much in common with Inuktitut (and dialects thereof) and Kalaallisut,
    but the relevant issue here is of orthography. Kalaallisut uses only the letters:
    [a e f g i j k l m n o p q r s t u v] in upper- or lowercase, plus standard numerals
    and punctuation (inc. guillemot). In terms of supporting any \u2018extra\u2019
    diacritics, language support for Danish would be more relevant.\r\n\r\nOlder (pre-early
    1970's) did use some diacritics and the \u2018kra\u2019 (voiceless uvular plosive)
    [\u0138], so the only environment in which it would be used would be to reproduce
    older texts, unless there's another spelling reform. Nowadays, as in Latin-based
    Inuktitut orthographies, the \u2018q\u2019 is used.\r\n\r\nI think you may have
    a difficult time finding texts in Kalaallisut that talk about typography, but
    you never know."
