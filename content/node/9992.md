  body: After looking up VAG Rounded in my font handbook I see it was developed by
    Volkswagen in 1979, hence the Volkswagen Van in Beuys&#39; artwork... who says
    these graphic designers don&#39;t earn their money. :-&#41;

  body: It&#39;s the corporate font of TATE museums in England. A custom version very
    close to VAG, commissioned by the Wolff Olins branding agency, used for all corporate
    communications of the 4 TATE museums.
