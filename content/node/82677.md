body: "Can anyone name the non-cursive font on this wedding invitation? You may have
  to cut and paste the link, as I can't get the hyperlink to appear automatically.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.weddingpaperdivas.com/product/3142/thermography_wedding_invitations_serene_spring.html\r\n\r\nThe
  website calls the font \"roman all caps,\" and indeed, it resembles Times New Roman
  (on MS word) in all caps. However, it's not quite the same. \r\n\r\nI would like
  to find the real font so I can see what it looks like at different point sizes when
  actually printed. I am ordering wedding invitations, and I would like to see what
  the font looks like true to size, since that was a key factor I wanted to be adjusted.
  For some reason, the company cannot give me a true to size digital proof, so I thought
  that if I found the font somewhere and printed out the copy in the proper size,
  I would have a better sense.\r\n\r\nthanks for any help you can offer.\r\n\r\nVicki"

  body: Also, the printing company probably added something like a .15 stroke to the
    type in Illustrator, because the typeface is so delicate. The proof won't be 100%
    accurate to how it will actually print. And keep in mind that the ink/powder usually
    spreads a little bit in thermography.
