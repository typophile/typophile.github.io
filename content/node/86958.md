  wrong forum or not allowed. \r\n\r\nI am in the process of redesigning some stationery...personal
  and corporate and looking for some paid help from someone who is good with fonts/design.
  \r\n\r\nThe task basically involves 1) Creating a personal letterhead using an elegant
  font, and 2) Selecting a professional font for my company name\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease
  do let me know if you can help or can refer me to someone who can.\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much,\r\ndesidude\r\n\r\n"
