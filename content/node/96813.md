  and in that article, the author talks about books written by Bodoni and others.
  Since these books have been written some centuries ago, it is safe to assume that
  they are out of copyright. I was wondering if i can access these books anywhere
  online. Not only books by Bodoni but by other typographers also. Can any one point
  me to these books.\r\nThanks\r\nTypogruffer"

    we all know, because of its age. But of course, somewhere out there, there still
    copies of such books. I want to use those fonts on my paper writing needs. You
    know, like a dairy or scrapbook. This is the only way I could rid of stress from
    university''s demanding schedule and requirement. By the way, I am a literature
    major and essay writer here: http://www.rushessay.com/. So from time to time,
    I am trying to be creative when it comes to writing.'
