body: I am doing some freelance work for a non-profit and they have asked me to find
  AR Delaney and use it as their font - I have googled it & gone to font sites & it's
  not there. Does anyone know where I can get this font? Or what it looks like and
  what would be a close substitute? Also since I am a teacher & not very good at this,
  how do I load new fonts once found? Does anyone know of a link/site where I can
  get the information to update/add fonts to my system? I'm on a mac OS x 10.5.8 Thank
  you for your help!
