  it hard to see clearly. Well, I would love some advice, or tips rather. I'm looking
  for what I'm sure many have heard as a request numerous times; a classical modern
  typeface. \r\nI will use it white on black, both online and print, this is for a
  brand that are new but wish to look slightly 'mature', not trendy.\r\n\r\nHope you
  all a good rest of the day, remember to use the watercooler, I know this office
  feels like a sauna right now..\r\n\r\n-Marjo"

    typefaces...

    reductive finish.\r\nI've done that in a few faces, such as Beaufort (apparently
    a cheese as well) and Bodoni Egyptian."

    can have different meanings. From the perspective of philosophy, history and social
    sciences it would describe the Age or Reason and Rationalism, form the enlightenment
    onwards, and traces can be found in the way people think up to the 1960s. (Some
    actually argue, that the deathly system of the Nazis was rationalism in extreme,
    Adorno for example) Generally speeking you can summarize the \"long\" 19th century
    as the main time of modernity. \r\n\r\nAs people here are familiar with history
    of ideas, you got two answers so far, which interpreted your \"modern\" as \"19th
    century type\". Giving you answers related to the Didone types and other modern
    typefaces. \r\n\r\nI assume you mean \"contemporary\".\r\n\r\nWith classical I
    guess you refer to something like \"traditional\", \"old-school\" and \"established\"?
    This would be probably every mainstream text typeface from the renaissance, to
    old style, to then actually modern(!) (Scotch, Didone, Bodoni) and Transitional.\r\n\r\nBased
    on the assumption that you want a contemporary but still traditional typeface,
    I would recommend you:\r\n\r\nSome more rare:\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_maiola_ot/|Maiola]]\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_yoga_pro/|FF
