<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Just created this logotype for a client and It would be cool to get some advice/criticism on the flourishes that I've made on the Uppecase A and C.
They were based on the flourishes in the typeface 'Odile' by village, but fused with the Caslon (two twenty four) style.
I've never attempted a heavy-edit like this so would be good to know if there's anything wrong with it!
See what you think,
Ed

<div class=commentbody>Hi there Ed,
I really like the serif part of the logo, I know you asked if we could comment on the flourishes but I just wanted to say a quick thing about the Associates part of it.
Using Helvetica thin makes the word almost dissappear, it feels very dominated by the seriffed word. It might be an idea to go up a weight. Just a visual thought thats all.
As for the flourishes, I think they are working really well, I have just designed a logo for a swiss bank based around a 16th century script font and the one thing i couldnt put my finger on at the time was that I have not made the flourishes big enough.
I realised that I should have been a lot bolder with them and really excentuate them. I think the C is working really nicely, but I think the A could do with a little more. Its the start of the logo and might be a nice way to lead in.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Matt,
I think I like the way that the associates is dominated - it very much emphasises the Abigail Carney part (which is good as it is a very personal business at the moment). I'll try 45 light though maybe!
I agree I think the A needs something else – seen any nice A's around?

<div class=commentbody>I think you need to draw the A, I think the shape of the flourish is good, it compliments the rest of the logo, I jus think it needs extending a little, made larger.

<div class=commentbody>Sorry of course, here are a couple, i like Byron a lot due to the flourish actually being seperate from the main letter. They arnt brilliant examples but might show how the flourish is a little excentuated.

This one I have just thrown in as I love it, really nice embeleshing typeface. Probably a bit over the top for what you need but beautiful all the same.

When I designed a script logo, i basically traced a simple flourish from another typeface and then just stretched it a little here and there. I am no type designer so it was the easiest way really.

<div class=commentbody>I think you can afford to be more extravagant with the flourish on the C and extend it to the right past the serif to balance the letter. I looked at the decorative initials of Odile, I find them a bit cramped which is understandable since it might have to function with lines of copy above and below, for a logotype with an exclusion area you don't have the same problem. Extending the C's flourish will also help it to balance with the cap height of Associates. I would approach the A from a different direction either by extending the lefthand vertical downward and inserting a scroll (you could try curving it up to form the crossbar). The other approach I would look at is a horizontal flourish from the top going left and curving down.
An alternative might be to really go over the top on the C, leaving the A as standard, if you make the focus of the flourish lead toward the centre of the logo it could balance nicely. Matt's idea for using a flourish from another font is one way of working alternatively if you type out the logo with no flourish and print out several copies and work over the top with a pencil, scan it and draw it.
I would also increase the rn kerning, stop them crashing.

<div class=commentbody>Great, thanks very much to both of you.
Some nice ideas there and good advice! I agree I think the flourishes should be developed and exaggerated and it will make the mark even more unique - and emphasise the contrast. The idea has been presented and the client loves it so we'll see how things go!

<div class=commentbody>Ed I think that's fantastic!
Despite other's views, I like the fact that Associates is so less dominant... the emphasis is needed on Abigail Carney.
I see what others are saying about the A of Abigail... it could be good to make more of a fuss over it... say perhaps having a larger flourish coming from the bottom-left??
Otherwise I don't what else to say, I love it myself. </div>
