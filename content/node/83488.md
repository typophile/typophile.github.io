  to pick people's brains on the translation of type to sound. My background is in
  interaction and visual communication design and I'm doing research on designing
  for the blind, specifically via physical interfaces using Arduino and Processing.\r\n\r\nMy
  goal is to create an audible alphabet, if you will, translating type to sound. Is
  anyone aware of previous research in this area?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nCallie Neylan"

    (steady drone, pitch never reaching too high or falling too low, predictable).
    \r\n\r\nYou'll have more success tying typefaces to music, i.e. helvetica = elevator
    muzak, goudy swash = early swing, etc."

  body: "I was going to say that going non-voice wouldn't make much sense, as you'd
    be limited to one letter at a time communication, without the ability of phonetics
    to create words.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current scientific understanding of reading
    is that it IS letter-driven, and there is no \"word superiority effect\" (see
    Kevin Larsen, frequent Typophiler).\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThe attribution of sound
    to shapes, be it simple alphabetic letter shape, or the more complex tonality
    of a type style, is not something that can be done by a self-evident generative
    algorithm/transform, but is something that requires a high degree of subjective
    interpretation.\r\n\r\nOne would expect a binocular \"g\" to have a \"busy\" sound,
    and a serif style likewise to be busier than a sans: that in itself is an interpretation.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    if the alphabet is coded by pitch, does that mean that \"g\" would have the lowest
    note, and \"l\" the highest?\r\nOr would pitch be allocated according to the frequency
    of letters in text? Or sequence in the alphabet? These are too language-specific,
    or would that just be accent? It's hard to escape the logic of phonetics as being
    your best bet, scientifically.\r\n\r\nType style would seem to correspond to timbre.\r\n\r\nCertainly
    a low bit rate sound (eg primitive video game or 1980s drum machine) would indicate
    a simple techno typeface. \r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nFonts exist as digital data, so you
    should be able to try different generative models.\r\nIn the Softmachine video,
    Eric assigned a different note to each letter. The initial result was extremely
    irritating, percussively, so he ran it through a filter to end up more like a
    gamelan.\r\n "

    German, but, dubbed over top of that \u2013 with a slight delay \u2013 is a newscaster
    in your language, translating. That translator's voice is what Helvetica sounds
    like."

  body: You could feed the alphabet as an image somehow into MetaSynth's image sythesizer
    and listen to the results. It probably won't be all that musical or harmonious,
    but neither would any other typeface, I'd imagine. http://www.uisoftware.com/MetaSynth/index.php
