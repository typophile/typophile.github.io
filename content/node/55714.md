body: "Hi everyone, I'm working on a logo for an outdoor company called Yeti Outdoor.
  \r\n\r\nI've found two fonts that would work well with my logo (see images) but
  can't ID them. Could you help me? \r\n\r\nI like Block Berthold (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/block-be/extra-condensed/).
  Do you know any other fonts in the same family (soft corner and hand-drawn edges)?
  \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: The second looks like the custom type used by Michael Schwab. That isn't available.
    But you can get close with <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Agenda">Agenda</a>.

  body: "Hey Tiffany, it is from Michael Schwabb... well spotted. Too bad it's not
    available.\r\nAgenda looks nice, maybe I could try to custom the edges (like Berthold)
    to make it look more \"nature\" \"outdoor\"."
