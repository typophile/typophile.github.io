  body: What Michael may be implying is that his <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/ihof/p22_pooper_black/">P22
    Pooper Black</a> could work for you.

  body: "Speak Up is a style that I use in many variations. Slanted, vertical, compressed,
    expanded, extended etc. ad infinitum. P22 Pooper Black and P22 Sneaky are the
    incarnations of these variations. You could skew Pooper Black and achieve the
    same feel. You of course could add the appropriate joins in Illustrator (the cheap
    way) and make adjustments after the skew or pay for a custom design.\r\n\r\nAll
    the best \r\nMichael"

  body: "This has soothed my soul. It has been a bleak weekend. I lost my workhorse
    computer, along with 4 fonts I was working on and a large design project this
    weekend so I was a bit down (putting it lightly, and to those who might be happy...
    no I had not backed them up). But Dan, If the stars align and I can retrieve some
    software I will do what you need gratis. Just let me know. As long as it is not
    5000 words!\r\n\r\nMichael"

    for a camp logo (the camp I direct). I wouldn't want to take advantage of your
    time and talent, but if you want to do this, I would be very honored. I do feel
    very sorry for what happened to you..."

    way (Robin Williams). I wept, I got angry, and I wrote in the margins!\r\n\r\nThe
    workhorse was system 9.2 and I was working in Fontographer with archaic Photoshop
    and Quark. On this computer I have system 10 but only FontLab which I am trying
    to learn in small doses. Poor Richard Kegler has been accepting my fonts in Fontographer
    for far too long. God bless his soul.\r\n\r\nAnyway I will do your logo. Send
    info to:\r\n\r\ntyperror@aol.com\r\n\r\nI will work on it at one of my friend's
    shop. You just have to be patient. \r\n\r\nThanks for the wake up call\r\nMichael"
