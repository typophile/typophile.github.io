body: Has anyone here ever worked with Egyptian hieroglyphics? I am working with an
  author who has embedded hieroglyphs in Microsoft Word documents using a program
  called WinGlyph (which is no longer available). This is for a university press book.
  From what I've been able to determine the images made their way into Word via a
  wmf format, which I believe is too low quality for high-end printing. But the author
  says that he has submitted Word documents with such glyphs embedded in them to journals
  and they looked all right. The author also says of hieroglyphs in conventional font
  formats that "none of them is adequate for serious Egyptological work, insofar as
  they do not allow for 'stacking,' i.e. the placement of one glyph on top of one,
  two, three others. They are all just linear which is not how hieroglyphs were written."
  If I am looking at taking each instance of the glyphs and fixing it in Illustrator
  this would be a monumental project. Any thoughts?

    images from the Word file. If it kept the original images. Have you contacted
    Microsoft?

  body: If the author can send you the input text, which is presumably in <em>Manuel
    de codage</em> format, you can use one of the other Egyptian layout engines that
    is available. FWIW, there's one for Mac called MacScribe, which can output *.eps
    files for you. I don't know whether the Windows options (InScribe, Glyphotext)
    output vector art, but this might be worth looking into. There's also a TeX one
    called HieroTeX.

    ..</cite>\r\n\r\nNah-- not if the images are vector-based. Sure, wmf lacks stuff
    like bezier curves and three-point gradient filling, but I presume you are talking
    about simple (in geometric terms!) black-and-white shapes.\r\n\r\nDid you check
    the <em>other</em> files you get on Save as Web page? You are probably overlooking
    the .emz (or .wmz) files because you cannot open them with anything. Rename one
    of these to .gz, extract using just about any compression program except Windows'
    built-in one (7-Zip has no problems with gz), rename the result back to: emf (for
    an emz file) or wmf (for a wmz). Then open in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't
    work, follow Tomi's advice and print to PDF."

  body: "It may be worth noticing that Egyptian Hieroglyphs have been given official
    Unicode points about one year ago. Though that will hardly help with handling
    of older documents and specific file formats, the way is now open to implement
    Old Eyptian based on regular encoding. Of course, the variable stacking of glyphs
    renders a particular challenge for text composing. However, I imagine that some
    Opentype solutions may well provide remarkable possibilities to elegantly master
    even that. Given the sheer amount of characters (over 1000) this means a very
    great deal of intense work to master though. \r\nAre Egyptologists aware of that
    perspective? Or will they lean back and wonder about others who \u201Cfail to
    handle\u201D the matter, like they did for so long time? The encoding of the Egyptian
    Hieroglyphs was not a project of any academical institution, it was the effort
    of one single independent man."

  body: "Andreas, if Egyptologists are anything like the other language scientists
    I have had to deal with, they'd probably <em>reluctantly</em> submit their papers
    electronically. Because before that, they'd always sent in engraved stone slabs,
    and that worked just fine the past two hundred years.\r\n\r\nIf the Unicode coding
    only makes sense in combination with Opentype features, the task of producing
    the correct hieroglyphs is delegated to software developers ... in other words,
    you may expect the full range of 'totally not supported' <em>via</em> 'good-but-not-quite'
    to 'hey, in <em>this</em> program it works perfectly'. Granted, as soon as you
    found a program where it works, it's just a matter of writing a PDF and using
    that instead in the program of your choice."

    (if you read the language). I just opened one of those files on my MacBook Pro,
    copied some text as pdf (the Edit menu allows \"Copy as...\" > \"Copy as PDF\")

    svg (for further processing in Illustrator for instance) but be careful: at least
    with encapsulated pdf, it is the selection that is exported, not the full text.
    If you select nothing, you get an empty file and an error when you try opening

    was several years ago). It looks like it will be very useful if I have to work
    with Egyptian again.
