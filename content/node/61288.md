body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a little feedback on a font I recently designed;
  Elken - a black, solid, display face with a stencil-type structure. (I didn't set
  out to create a stencil font, it happened by itself?)\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I know
  there are many problems with the spacing/kerning, and I have issues with c, g, s
  and t. I'd love to hear any comments or criticism... As it is my first font, I have
  much to learn. <br>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elken_3865.jpg]<br>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/r_5444.jpg]<br>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elkend_6625.jpg]"

  body: "Could you share with us the concept, thinking behind this typeface? \r\nI
    like the look of it. Look very industrial, like metal screw.\r\n\r\na, c and u
    look similar, just different width. What if you eliminate the top right serif
    of letter a. what is wrong with g ? s might look like o, but the diagonal cut
    help define it, try to experience with other shape instead of circle. t is different
    because it is 1 shape, unlike the other have 2 shapes.\r\n\r\nI can't read the
    word elken, thought it was ellren. Maybe because the kerning and letterspacing
    is the same. \r\n\r\nSmall l look like uppercase I.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about
    r.\r\n\r\nx and z has the same shape, but different cut.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'd try the 'e' with the projecting nub coming out above the line and more
    horizontally, like the spur on a font like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/jenson/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26seed%3D20%26dock%3D0%26size%3D194%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3De%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3D|Jenson]].

  body: The shapes are great, IMHO. But the spacing do need some fixing. :D

  body: "hi! thanks for your comments... I haven't had time to look back at my work
    since posting this, and now things seem to be a little clearer..\r\n\r\nthe letter
    shapes grew out of some abstract-y sketching of mine based on the systematic/organic
    shapes of elk antlers - then I was looking at creating letters out of a modular
    sort of version of those shapes. but the final forms did turn out to be relatively..
    hm.. cold, compared to the original scribbles.\r\n\r\nI had a look at jenson;
    thats quite an unusual feature... haven't seen that before?\r\n\r\nyes, the spacing
    is tricky - the letterforms themselves actually prevent the spacing from working
    out effectively. I'm thinking maybe a little bit of a redesign might be in order.."
