    Thus all marketing material, drawings, specifications and contract documents (including
    Change Orders, Requests for Information, Application for Payment, etc.) will utilize
    the same few typefaces.\r\n\r\nps: we're a small, young studio with locations

    discontinued about 6 years ago. There are several versions of the original Neuropol
    of varying quality still hanging around of free font sites. In 2004, the old Neuropol
    family was scrapped. I redrew Neuropol X from scratch. In 2008, version 2 was
    released which had better vertical metrics. In 2009, more accented characters
    were added to support a few more languages.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typodermic.com/19.html\r\n\r\nFor

  body: Cheers! Funny you should mention Myriad because I have often seen Neuropol
    X mixed with Myriad and it looks petty sharp. Avoid other squarish fonts or closed
    shapes like Avant Garde. I've seen it mixed with Microgramma and it's not so hot.
    I'm not a typographer tho, so perhaps someone else will have some advice for a
    compatible text font.

    I think it\u2019s mostly a gut response to dafont.com. To me, Neuropol X looks
    like a retro futuristic techno font, not something I would ever consider for architecture.
    Myfonts show a better specimen (especially the important superior 2 & 3) and from
    the looks of it seems sufficent for display. It wouldn\u2019t be much of a text
    font though \u2013 it is way to expressive. \r\n\r\n@Robert: Why not try a different
    direction?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ex_3698.png]\r\nHere\u2019s
    something slightly squarish that could do the job in both headlines and text.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/normal_6486.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leicht_6184.gif]\r\nAnother

    note our initial approach utilized Lubalin's AvantGarde LT Book + AvantGarde ExtraLight.
    \ It appeared rather dated; test subjects indicated their preference for a more
    architectural typeface like Eurostile Extended.  Thus we arrived at the futuristic/geometric

    might also make it too specific. I see you style is clean, modernist, but warm
    (natural materials), so I would look for typefaces that have a simular feel. The
    fonts you suggested are all too techy in my opinion. Perhaps a humanist sans,
    or a geometric face with humanist qualities (not neccesarily Gill Sans though).
    Museo comes to mind (also the sans version) \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/museo_4059.jpg]\r\n\r\nand
