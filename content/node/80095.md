  laser printer, my budget is around 200Euro's. Its going to be for type proofing
  but also to print out test pages for logo's, magazines etc.\r\n\r\nTo be honest
  ive always had HP printers but i really do not like them, always had troubles with
  them after some time.\r\n\r\nis there any brand or specific model you guys can recommended,
  would really appreciate the help!\r\n\r\n(I know there are some topics about this
  subject but since there's always new models on the market i thought why not ask
  it again, maybe there's better stuff out there these days) \r\n\r\n "

  body: I have a Brother HL5370DW printer, and am very happy with it. It has a PostScript
    emulation mode, not true PostScript, but for my purposes that doesn't matter because
    I'm not needing to proof stuff targeted at PS devices.

  body: "thank you for the reply John.\r\n\r\nI nobody has some other suggestions
    worth checking into then i think i'm going for the \"Brother HL-5240L\"\r\n\r\nIts
    about 100\u20AC cheaper than the model suggested by John.\r\n\r\nHope i don't
    regret the fact that i went for the cheaper model. \r\n\r\nMaybe another question,
    would it actually be a smart thing buying a laser printer at the moment, i'm on
    a mac and the new OS Lion should come out around June...i know some people who's
    printers became obsolete due to no available drivers for the latest OS."

    really great when it comes to print type in small sizes IMHO. Some scans [[http://typophile.com/node/77541|here.]]
    All in all, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a very good option if you have a limited budget.\r\n\r\n<cite>
    > would it actually be a smart thing buying a laser printer at the moment, i'm

    that you can\u2019t work in March with a printer that you\u2019ll buy in June.
    Since Brother has been updating the drivers for this model frequently (I was notified
    of the latest version one week ago or something), I\u2019d say that it will be
    supported on Lion."
