  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello all, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm working on my first attempt at a complete typeface. It may be ambitious on the first time out, but I figure it's the best way to learn. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm trying to develop a text face that incorporates the readability attributes of a serif but retains the spirit of a &quot;traditional&quot; sans. I want to stay away from the elegance of Optima, and lean more towards a true sans, while still pushing the stroke contrast and such. I guess it's a gray area I will have to explore, hopefully with your help. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are my initial lc pencil drawings. There are obviously still a lot of problems with the axis in some of the letters. I want a vertical axis. Also, please note that none of the strokes are meant to be flared. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are my thoughts as I develop it: The e, k, l and j feel like what I'm going for. Some of the other letters feel too &quot;pretty&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, after I get the basic shapes and proportions right, I'd like to add a little more character to some of the forms. The h, m, n and u feel lifeless, for example.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'd love comments as well as perhaps some guidance in the technical aspects of developing this typeface, like translating it accurately to vector art and then into Fontographer.

		<div class="commentbody">The &quot;j&quot;: it just looks like the descender is being &quot;interrupted&quot;, somehow. The &quot;e&quot;: it's certainly an unconventional form; this doesn't mean it can't work, but it does mean its merit hasn't been &quot;proven&quot; via extended mainstream usage. So you have to try it out in actual printed text, show it to people (the right people), take a break from it and come back later (like a month at least) to see if you still think it works, etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Readability: you really have to make some &quot;internal&quot; decisions first, like how to balance readability versus style (since neither can ever be total); and how you'd like this font to be used (large text in a magazine, small type on labels, or what). There really is no generic solution that can make a design good for everything (although you could say some uses are much more common than others, and it might make sense to target that mainstream primarily). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One big factor in readability though is variance (which it seems you've already noted). It's hard to glean your stance on that from the digital glyphs, but your hand sketches are encouraging - you're putting some nice &quot;spin&quot; among letters that tend to be too close. I think the &quot;a&quot; could have a smaller bowl, the &quot;t&quot; slightly more presence, the &quot;w&quot; a shorter middle peak, the &quot;y&quot; a stronger tail, and the &quot;f&quot; a stronger beak. I think the descenders could be slightly shorter (or the ascenders longer, depending on the font's intended usage), and the &quot;g&quot; is a bit too classical (although it's highly readable). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>
