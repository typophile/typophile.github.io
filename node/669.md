  body: I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get some good answers, but especially for the rare
    ones &#40;like Collis&#41; your best bet might actually be asking the foundry
    &#40;or the designer&#41; directly. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    check the sleeve of Radiohead&#39;s latest album, &#34;Hail to the Thief&#34;,
    done by Stanley Donwood of www.slowlydownward.com.

  body: Peter Bil&#39;ak just showed some uses of his faces at TypeCon. But I just
    got back from a 7 hour drive through a lightning storm, so I don&#39;t recall
    whether it was Eureka or Fedra or both &#40;sorry, Peter :-\ &#41;. Perhaps you
    could email him. Or someone else from TypeCon may have a better memory than I...

  body: Mrs. Eaves was used in the credits for &#34;Run Lola Run&#34; and, wonders
    of wonders, got a mention in the end credits for both Mrs. Eaves and Zuzana Licko.
    Unfortunately, a quick search through Google gave me no screen shots to point
    you toward!

    anywhere in a Barnes and Noble and spot the use of it on a book or magazine cover,
    not to mention on B &amp; N&#39;s own signage. For better or worse, it is ubiquitous...

  body: Roberto de Vicq de Cumptich worked with <a href="http://www.muccadesign.com/">Mucca
    Design</a> to produce a poster using Mrs. Eaves that was distributed during the
    last HOW Design conference. I am trying to locate a version of this poster online,
    but have not had any luck so far. The strangest thing about this poster was that
    it was designed for Adobe to promote OpenType, yet doesn&#39;t use any of Adobe&#39;s
    own OpenType fonts.
