    along the way. \r\n\r\n(I'm particularly glad that this caught your eye, Peter;
    the <em>Blackletter</em> catalogue was a real inspiration for my work.)"

    and see the exhibition in person. Have you thought about turning the web site
    into a magazine article? Work like this really deserves to be preserved in print."

  body: "@James: Thanks for the compliment. I agree that it'd be nice to see this
    information in print. The website wound up taking the place of a printed catalogue
    for feasibility's sake. There's been some murmurs of possibilities of reassembling
    the show for some new venues in other cities - if that happens perhaps a printed
    catalogue would be possible. I also have thought the information might make for
    a good special issue of a design journal, but I haven't pursued that so far.\r\n\r\n"
