  body: "To me the \xBBO\xAB looks too small compared to the other characters. The
    \xBBV\xAB also looks a little too wide, maybe it's the kerning which is not tight
    enough.\r\nI also think the kerning between \xBBT\xAB and \xBBI\xAB could be tighter
    and the kerning between \xBBI\xAB and \xBBM\xAB is too tight.\r\nThose are my
    thoughts so far."

    about the O, trade gothic has the same issue (the O looks a bit narrower) but
    i have slightly adjusted it anyway.\r\nI also corrected the kerning around V and
    T (not sure about E-R?), thanks for your suggestions!"

  body: "This is a good start! Over time you'll probably learn that things rarely
    are what they look like in type. A perfect circle does not look \"right\" - someone
    more experienced can probably explain better exactly why - but this is apparent
    in your O and R. In O, the parts where straight edge meets curve needs to be smoother.
    You can try nudging your nodes and extending the vertical bezier handles to make
    the transition smoother and the half circles less perfect round (more of a slightly
    sqooushed circle). Try the same with your R, only horizontally.\r\n\r\nV, E and
    M are too wide compared to your other narrow letters (or the other way around).
    In this style, capitals tend to be rather uniform in width."

    about the joint of line-curve, thanks for pointing that out, here's how i corrected
    it:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ovt7_5555.png]\r\n\r\nIs the \"wideness\"
    of V-E-M so evident?\r\nBy making the M narrower i fear it might become too \"black\"
    compared to the rest of the logo and, while i can adjust again the points of connection
    between stems and diagonal strokes, that would ruin the evenness of strokes and
    would result in a less mono-line effect...\r\n\r\nHere's my logo compared to the

    but this is coming along nicely. Have you considered lifting the apex of your
    M up from the baseline? That way you could make it even narrower. It's great that
    you observe the weight issues with M. This is where optical  adjustments come
    in handy. It looks quite good now. The last optical thing I would adjust is the
    top bar of E. It could be slightly shorter, and I think it's the main reason it
    looks so wide to me.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I'm far from a pro. Take my advice with
    a barrel of salt."

  body: "Optically the bottom stroke of the O and E look a bit heavy. Also the waist
    of the R is looking a touch heavy as well. The V form in the M is also looking
    dark. The waist of the E is a matter of taste, but the shorter you make it the
    more 19th century the letterform becomes. The short waist is not helping the space
    between the E and R. In fact the VE, ER, RT and TI look too open when compared
    with the straight-to-straight spacing of the IM, ME.\r\n\r\nThe O still has some
    problems at the tangent.\r\n\r\nEd Benguiat first clued me in to the trick of
    lightening the bottom strokes of letters ever so slightly to compensate for the
    optical illusion of them appearing too heavy. It has to be a tiny move, maybe
    only a unit or two in FL. But it does make a difference."

    spacing of the IM, ME.</em>\r\n\r\nAlmost to reiterate terminaldesign, spacing
    this is utterly key, and since you are <em>drawing</em> the letters you actually
    have the opportunity to improve the spacing by adjusting things like the waist
    of the E, or apex of M. If you were spacing a font you'd eventually have to reach
    a compromise between a form and it's spacing but here you can really tweak it.
    Then know when to stop ;-)\r\n\r\nAgree that this thread improves."

  body: I think there is some fine tuning to do on kerning, especially in the first
    part of the word (OVER). It's seems there is two kind of kerning in OVERTIME.
    While the first part are loose, the end (TIME) is tighter. At my own, I prefer
    the second part. So, I would suggest that you tight a bit more OVER. Also, I think
    your R would be better if you move a bit to the left the top of the oblique, under
    the bottom bowl or move the bottom to the right. Actually to me it's seems like
    a P with a bar under. Keep going.

  body: "I think you have problems here with rhythm, because of the relative widths
    of different letters. The widths affects the amount of white within and between
    characters, and this needs to be more visually even to get a good look, IMHO.
    Normally, the R and T would be wider than the E. My impression is that the E is
    the odd man out, but probably everything needs to be adjusted relative to the
    O, if that's the width you want. \r\n\r\nI find it instructive to open other fonts--sans
    fonts in this case--and see what they do. Then try OOVOOEOOROOTOOIOOMOO IIOIIVIIEIIRIITIIMII,
    etc. and play with widths until you think it's all balanced. Since you're only
    doing these letters, not a font, theoretically it isn't needed, but you might
    find it helpful. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Just checking Trade Gothic (and News Gothic, to which it is similar), I see
    that the O is rounder and wider. When you do the straight sides, that will affect
    the rhythm of everything else, so you can't just take widths of glyphs in Trade
    Gothic as a guide. Though, still, your E is too wide compared to the R there.
    Also in your first drawing, on the grid, your E and R are the same width.\r\n\r\nNot
    only width, but volume of whites matters... \r\n\r\nAlso your idea, if I understand
    it rightly, that \"more constructed\" equals \"more polished\" is not sound, I
    think. Trade Gothic is actually very polished, and pushing it into a coarse grid
    makes it very hard, if not impossible, to keep the polish. "
