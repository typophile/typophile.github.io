body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a logo design for a bespoke furniture
  company based in Oslo, Norway. \r\n\r\nThe client wants to communicate a sense of
  solidity and modern design, just as the furniture they design for their clients.
  I showed him this concept and he liked it. I would like to know your opinions about
  it and suggestions on how to refine it (kerning etc...) .\r\n\r\nThank you very
  much for your attention,\r\n\r\nPierluigi[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arquitech_6418.jpg]"
