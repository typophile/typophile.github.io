    target="_blank"> Mason Serif</a> rip-off we once had identified? <BR>Can&#39;t
    remember its name -- actually don&#39;t <i>want</i> to remember  <BR>its name.

  body: Yep, just found it, and it is indeed an illegal clone, so I won&#39;t  <BR>point
    you to it. Sorry, but that would be against Typophile  <BR>policy. <BR>Let&#39;s
    just say it&#39;s a cross between <a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1017.jhtml"
    target="_blank"> Charlemagne</a> and Mason  <BR>Serif, so you can pick which one
    of the two source designs  <BR>you like the most.

  body: Yves, are you referring to <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/38225.html">this
    thread</a>? While I see some similarity in the &#39;A&#39; and &#39;O&#39;, this
    one looks quite different to me.

  body: You&#39;re right, I think I got confused with all these parallel showings.
    <BR>My mistake, the hunt is still on.
