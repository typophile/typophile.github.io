  body: I hope Starbucks paid for the fonts. I think P22 should have gotten a better
    deal out of them for the huge promotional graphics on the wall in every store.

  body: P22? I'm pretty shure the font in these images is Ketchupa by Peter Bruhn/Fountain
    Fonts. I'm also pretty shure these are old samples and have been identified here
    before.

    looks like <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?7B0\">Alternate Gothic 2</a>
    at this angle. But it could also be <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/39583\">Trade
    Gothic Condensed as said here.</a>"

  body: I was not referring to this font. I meant Cezanne. The only connection between
    the two is Starbucks.
