body: I&#39;m stumped on a font that hopefully someone can help me out with.  I&#39;ve
  gone through all the most commonly used Old English fonts and can&#39;t seem to
  decode this one.  Font sample taken from the cover of the most recent McSweeney&#39;s
  Quarterly Journal no.13.  <BR> <BR>Most notable distinctive qualities include the
  full-loop tail on &#39;y&#39;, unique upright/offset strokes on &#39;M&#39;, and
  the interesting &#39;3&#39;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41330.jpg"

    work.  Hard to believe this comes from a <i>quarterly</i> journal - it looks as
    though it took years to assemble. '
