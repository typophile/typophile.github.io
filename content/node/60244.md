  font. http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typofonderie/apolline/\r\n\r\nThis book has a
  lot of elements (a-heads, b-heads, lists, bullets, etc.) that I need a sans for.
  It's a simple, elegant, clean design. I've been creatively stuck on Gotham and Interstate.
  Does anyone have an alternative suggestion to get me out of my transportation rut?\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance-Janet"

    There are many alternatives...Frutiger/Myriad, Franklin Gothic/Trade Gothic, Gill
    Sans/Agenda...just off the top.\r\n\r\nJeo."

    its long extenders, would match Apolline.\r\nIt has all the bells and whistles
    for book work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
