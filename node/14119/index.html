<p>John Baskerville (1706-1775)</p>
<p>John Baskerville was born in Worcestershire, [[England]] in [[1706]]. As a young man he was introduced to the art of letters while working as a master writing teacher and stone engraver. He later began a career in manufacturing, making japanned ware (a type of lacquered metalware popular at the time). He soon amassed great wealth and purchased an estate near Birmingham.</p>
<p>Around [[1751]], Baskerville began experimenting with [[printing]]. Baskerville was a perfectionist, and as such he demanded complete control over the entire printing process. He designed and created [[type]] and layouts; improved the presses and inks; and developed new paper making techniques enabling the creation of smooth bright papers.</p>
<p>Baskerville&rsquo;s type was influenced by the works of Italian renaissance printers, like his English contemporary, [[William Caslon]]. But Baskerville refined their forms&ndash;creating type with more extreme contrast of thick and thin strokes. This gave his text great lightness and color. His letterforms were also wider and his [[italic|italics]] showed his calligraphic mastery. Baskerville&rsquo;s page layouts were spartan (especially compared to the ornate designs of French and Italian renaissance printers). Generally, they were completely typographic, allowing his letterforms to stand on their own. His designs stand as a pinnacle of [[transitional]] typography and as a prelude to the modern [[Didone]] design of later years.</p>
<p>Baskerville&rsquo;s work was widely dismissed during his time by British contemporaries as the work of an <em>amateur</em>. However, his influence on type and printing spread to Italy and France where [[Giovanni Battista Bodoni]] and [[the Didots]] furthered his ideas.</p>
<p>Baskerville&rsquo;s types have been the source of many revivals, some of which include:
