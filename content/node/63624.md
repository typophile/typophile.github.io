  body: "Well, Berlin has a couple of big schools. I don't know how friendly they
    are to foreign students who wan to come over for a semester. There are so many
    student enquiries already! Does your school in Denmark have a partnership with
    any schools in Berlin already? That could help a lot.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here are
    the schools that I can think of off the top of my head that teach graphic design
    in Berlin. These are all state-run institutions:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.udk-berlin.de/sites/content/themen/aktuelles/index_ger.html\">Universit\xE4t
    der K\xFCnste Berlin</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.kh-berlin.de/\">Kunsthocschule
    Wei\xDFensee</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.htw-berlin.de/\">HTW Berlin</a>\r\n\r\nThen
    just across the city border is the <a href=\"http://www.fh-potsdam.de/\">Fachhochschule
    Potsdam</a>."

    \ has some partnerships, but not sure yet which ones. I'll have to ind out.\r\nI'm
    pretty sure Berlin could be great, so if the schools won't have me, I'm gonna
    try find some place to intern. :)\r\n"
