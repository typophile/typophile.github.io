  for Submission: July 5, 2006</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nAt TypeCon 2006, the TypeGallery
  will showcase a selection of submissions from the weekly Type Battles that have
  raged in the Typophile forums this year.\_\r\n\r\nOn behalf of SOTA and Typophile,
  we'd like to invite you to submit a high-resolution version of your entry (or entries)
  to be printed and displayed in the TypeGallery this August in Boston. In addition
  to appearing on Typophile and live in Boston, some pieces may travel internationally
  after the conference, and/or may be selected for print publication and display on
  the TypeGallery website.\r\n\r\nYou may submit any selection of your entries from
  one or all of the battles you participated in. We are also interested in showing
  extensions of what was displayed in the Type Battles on Typophile. If you have continued
  working on your entries, please show us what you've done! Due to space constraints,
  this is a juried showcase, and we will use our discretion as to which pieces will
  be chosen for the exhibit.\r\n\r\n- Each piece will be printed on a tabloid (11in
  x 17in, 280mm x 432mm) sheet, black ink. Please scale appropriately. Pieces can
  be in landscape or portrait mode.\r\n\r\n- Please submit a <strong>hi-res, scaled
  version in either EPS, TIFF or PDF</strong> formats. Native Illustrator documents
  will also be accepted, though not preferred.\r\n\r\n- Submissions in JPG, GIF, PNG,
  .fog, or .vfb formats will <strong>not</strong> be accepted.\r\n\r\n- Label each
  file as such: <strong>Battle#_lastname_#.eps</strong> (example: Battle1_evens_1.eps)
  Please see the list of battles below, and name them accordingly.\r\n\r\nBattle 1

  Please zip your files (not over 10mb please), include your full name and send submissions
  to: evens@punchcut.com. If you have files larger than 10mb, please send us a link
  where we can download the images.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to contribute sketches on paper
  or other non-digital material, please send photos or scans of the material so that
  we may review them for inclusion in the show.\r\n\r\n<strong>We look forward to
  hearing from you and hope you'll consider being a part of the SOTA TypeGallery this
  year!</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please let us know.\r\n"

    is no need to resubmit. (Unless of course you have since extended the designs
    or participated in more recent battles)

    created them in Photoshop, you should be able to export the paths to vector shapes,
    which can then be scaled. \r\n\r\nYou may submit non-digital work as a scan or
    high quality photograph. If you'd like to submit the original piece, or a quality
    duplicate of the original, you may mail that in directly, but not before having
    a photograph of it reviewed first by the curators of the exhibit."

    them at 100% in addition to a larger version -- but not required.

    res being 72px/inch and print res being 300px/inch)\r\n\r\nAs far as exporting
    paths goes (sorry I'm recooping from a week of little to no sleep) I'm selecting
    the pixels and going to the 'Make Paths From Selection' but the paths are all
    screwy, are there settings to make this work?"

    that a selection of submissions <cite>may</cite> be shown on screen. \r\n\r\nI
    honestly can't say I've done much path exporting myself, I tend to draw with vector
    tools while in photoshop. I use a little trick that might work for you. Assuming
    your Photoshop doc is a bitmap, you can save as a PDF and then open this in Illustrator.
    You won't be able to edit the image, but it can be scaled as large as you want."

  body: David, if you save your pixel file as bitmap (.BMP), and then import into
    Illustrator, you can scale as you please and, in theory, the pixels remain perfectly
    square. I don't know what this tri pixel thingies look like, but this is the way
    to export pixel-based work and be able to scale it.

    just had trouble establishing paths when each line was only one pixel thick.\r\n\r\nI'm

    was established. Also it has some terrific and amusing stuff by Mark Simonson,
    among others. Also apparently it went all over the internet. '

    TypeGallery. If you are interesting in submitting work outside of the Type Battles,
    you will need to contact Shu at SOTA. I'll point him to this thread so he may
    respond with the necessary information."

  body: You can also scale up in photoshop using image size. Just make sure to change
    the interpolation from "bicubic" to "nearest neighbor" so you don't get any blurring.
