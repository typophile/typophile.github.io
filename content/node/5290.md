body: 'In another thread, JFP said: <BR> <BR>&#34;At my big surprize, the publisher
  wanted more pages than what my fonts and design proposed: to give to the potential
  buyer the feeling that he got heavy, so a complete dictionnary. If it was too light
  and thin, the future reader &#34;impression on the object&#34; can be very wrong:
  &#34;Hey, for the same price between two dictionnaries, this one is more heavy and
  features more pages, its better one for sure!&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure people
  do this, but as someone who sometimes dabbles in foreign languages, I have a different
  method in choosing a translation dictionary, at least. Any dictionary that contains
  the words &#34;altruism&#34;, &#34;vegan&#34; and &#34;quandary&#34; is probably
  a good bet. <BR> <BR>Anyone else have any &#34;tests&#34; they&#39;d like to share?

  body: A good dictionary must contain entries for the the Swadesh 200 List &#40;which
    obviously contains the Swadesh 100&#41;.  I don&#39;t know if you know what the
    list is &#40;it&#39;s 100/200 items and/or concepts that every language has a
    word for, like &#39;sun&#39; or &#39;hand&#39;&#41;; most dictionaries for &#34;larger&#34;
    languages will obviously include these words, but some languages--indigenous ones,
    for example--require a little work and research to make sure all these words are
    present...  believe me, it isn&#39;t always as easy as it sounds. <BR> <BR>Now
    as for your personal philosophy, it&#39;s a good one.  Ultimately one&#39;s dictionary
    choice is going to depend on their own personal needs; I mostly compare notes
    on indigenous language dictionaries, so the Swadesh list is what I look for--because
    these languages are relatively new to the idea of having bilingual dictionaries,
    the important part in the first stages of creating literature is to establish
    the most basic of terms.
