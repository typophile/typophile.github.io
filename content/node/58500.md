    couldn't find an exact match. Possibly custom work by him, or another lettering
    artist.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I checked with Ale Paul at Sudtipos and they didn't do it. It does seem similar
    to some of the things they have done though. Any other guesses? From all the research
    I've done, I'm beginning to think it is a font that has been customized as well.

  body: I'm going to guess this is entirely custom lettering rather than a customized
    font. In particular, look at the two cursive 's' glyphs. The one at the end of
    "Bros" is bigger and has a totally different shape than the one in "Lansky." It
    also seems a bit too perfect that the 'B' and 'y' form such a straight line.
