  body: "For certain the waiters did very well... lots of tips for them.\r\n\r\nBut
    people were buying orange juice and sides. And we all know that appetizers are
    ridiculously expensive and highly profitable.\r\n\r\nAs bizarre as the whole thing
    was... it was kinda cool if not kitch.\r\n\r\nDarrel, did you go too?\r\n\r\nMikey
