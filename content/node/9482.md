body: does anyone know if fontlab can automatically vertically center all glyphs in
  a font? In fact, what I a m trying to do is just center all glyphs both vertically
  and horizontally, or at least align all of them on the same horizontal baseline.
  <BR>I now have over 1038 glyphs in my font and can&#39;t imagine doing that manually
  &#40;off course I can, but it is such a waste of time...&#41; <BR> <BR>tnx

  body: "Ok, the idea was clever but also the implementation was not as straight forward
    as the idea. Here is a link to a fontlab action set that centers your glyphs vertically:\r\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/102586488/center_glyph_vertically.prg\r\n\r\nNote
    that you'll lost your original sidebearings (metrics) after running this action
    set.\r\n\r\nBahman"

  body: "Well, you can save the sidebearings (and kerning) and re-incorporate them
    after the vertical centering routine. Although the more things end up shifting
    up/down the less valid the original lateral spacing will be.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
