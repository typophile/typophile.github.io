  now and then, often to type. I am sure the same happens to many of you all too.\r\n\r\nI
  am just curious of everyone's opinion of the drop shadow."

    I've been working at my job for a few years, and it's definitely not permanent
    because the long-term goal here is my own business (in progress). Should I just
    take the "design advice" I'm given with a grain of salt?

  body: "Drop shadows have a purpose, usually to add contrast between letters and
    background. Google's primary-color theme stuck them with a yellow <strong>o</strong>
    that disappears into a white background unless you give it a shadow. \r\nDrop
    shadows used to be laborious (and therefore expensive) to make, so designers didn't
    use them very much. When PageMaker, Quark, and Photoshop made drop shadows available
    at the click of a mouse, designers and designer wannabees went crazy putting drop
    shadows on <em>everything</em>. (The same thing happened with gradient fills.)
    \r\nProfessors and art directors who lived through the Great Drop Shadow Epidemic
    of the early 90s often have a phobia about them, but you have nothing to fear
    if you practice safe specs. "

    your boss feels your work would benefit from a drop shadow, it may be a bit \"flat\".\r\n\r\nHowever,
    there are some circumstances where a drop shadow can be quite proper, such as
    when running type over a lively photograph.\r\n\r\nFor the Google logo, the drop
    shadow adds a vernacular, amateurish quality, which is in its way representative
    of the Web, where so much design is non-professional.\r\n\r\nMy 2001 take on such

    think Nick is spot-on about the Google logo. The search portals at the time when
    Google first appeared were slick, busy, techy looking pages then Google came along
    with its simple search box. \r\n\r\nIt <em>looked</em>  like the logo had been
    knocked up in thirty seconds using a pirated copy of Word by a spotty Jolt-drinking
    adolescent who dreams in HEX algorithms. \r\n\r\nI used to think drop shadows
    could look great, making text float above a page. It's so hackneyed and worn-out
    now though. Like Nick I'd only really consider using them to help text stand out
    over a busy picture."

    above. It is sometimes useful to drop in what is effectively a soft outline around
    type to improve contrast over a busy background. \r\n\r\nIf it's done gently enough,
    most would hardly notice it's there. Too many people, though, are not so delicate
    in their use of these effects."

  body: "From the view point of the sign industry, it is always best to create a basic
    version of any logo without effects. At some point, your client is going to want
    a sign. If it is a flat, digital print on a substrate, soft drop shadows and textures
    etc. are not an issue. If it is going to be a back lit sign, or routed sign these
    special effects pose a problem. If your logo doesn't really look good without
    the effects, it isn't going to look that much better routed out of brushed aluminum,
    mounted on a brick wall. Exterior lighted signs with special effects generally
    turn into visual noise from any distance. Designers don't generally take these
    conditions into account when creating these really cool effects. \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

    read.\r\n\r\n@Nick Shinn I understand what you are saying, but I just don't think
    that's the issue in this case. Likely more the fact that I happen to work in a
    mediocre design company that's stuck in a \"desktop publishing\" style rut where
    my boss once told me something to the effect of \"we aren't here to make innovative
    design\" and how he has a certain \"look\" for the design we produce at our studio.
    Sure I'm not totally satisfied with the way the company works and that is also
    part of the problem, but at the end of the day I have to pay the bills like everyone
    else. Two and a half years later I've found that the design we output has actually
    risen in quality, which I'm proud to mention. Still little of it has made it's
    way to my portfolio due to lack of concept.\r\n\r\n@jwchen\_touch\xE9!"

    I also added a \"casing\" (is that what you call it?)--a hard white line, technically
    a drop shadow too, between the type and the vignetted shadow. That can give a
    vignetted shadow more \"pop\", so that it can be quite discreet--light in tone
    and without much spread--and yet still do its job. More graphic, less pictorial.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bnews_6679.jpg]"
