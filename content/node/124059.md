  body: "Thanks for the reply DPape, I've tried Berthold and similar (Windsor Ultra
    Heavy for example?) but they're not quite right.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to identify
    something via the distinctive exaggerated double top serif on the uppercase 'A'
    but nothing so far.\r\n\r\nI suspect a look through a Letraset catalogue might
    be worthwhile."

    as well.

  body: "Actually DPape, I'll go with that as a solution, thanks a lot for the suggestion,
    with layer effects added it's obviously correct.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bar_x_effects_6221.png]"

  body: "In my opinion this is lettering.\r\nYou can find some of the flavor in Belwe
    Bold -- all but second line, which is Belwe Bold Condensed\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BelweBoldAsAuto_5339.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/BelweBoldCondAsNUDGE_4000.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/BelweBoldAs321_5621.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/BelweBoldAs123_5553.gif]\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/belwe/\r\nThe
    weight is similar and it is possible to edit for a fair match. Top terminal from
    _3_ can be flipped for use in the bottom terminal and flipped and mirrored for
    use in _2_.\r\nDon"
