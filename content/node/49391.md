body: "Hello everybody, \r\n\r\nI have recently started to learn about font design
  and attempted to generate a Helvetica-like sans serif (see also my font post: http://typophile.com/node/49228).
  I have some problems, however, in getting the fonts to display smooth at different
  sizes.  \r\n\r\nI have noticed that when using the font in Microsoft Word in contrast
  to Acrobat some of the curves are rendered very badly - see the arrows in the image
  bellow. \r\n\r\nQuestion:  What one can do to make sure that fonts are displayed
  smoothly in Word at various sizes (OS: XP with Cleartype turned on) \r\n- are there
  special design methods needed, is it a matter of metrics, or it is a problem with
  the outline shape i.e. bad design (the font is in a very early stage)?. \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any advice.\r\n\r\nWord:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Test_Word2_6507.PNG]\r\n\r\nAdobe

  body: You need to hint the font. Try switching to Fontlab or Fontforge, convert
    the font to Postscript Opentype, and then you can use the Adobe autohinter from
    <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/">AFDKO</a>?

  body: "Did you hint your outlines, or did FontLab (?) autohint while generating
    the fonts?\r\n\r\nWith ClearType turned on it may be better to not hint the font
    before you are finished designing it. Or try generating it as OTF with PostScript
    Outlines, then Windows won't use ClearType, just greyscale rendering, but the
    output will be less distorted and closer to your actual outlines.\r\n\r\nGood
    ClearType hinting can be quite a task ..."

  body: " The font is not hinted; I don't have Fontlab. I draw the fonts in TypeLight
    (free software, CR8 Type 2.2 - http://www.cr8.netfirms.com/typelight.html). \r\n\r\nI
    don't have any experience with Hinting (this is my first font), but I think I
    can convert the font to OTF using type light. I tried FontForge but I like Typelight
    more, because of its simplicity.  I will try the Adobe autohinter. \r\n\r\nI would
    be very interested to learn ClearType hinting if anybody can point me to a good
    tutorial or resource.\r\nThank you both for the great suggestions.\r\n"

    your problems. Also if it's TrueType outlines, make sure the bits are set correctly
    as to what sizes anti-aliasing is allowed at.\r\n\r\nT"

    type apps. I limit all my retail faces to just the very basic autohinting, as
    there is less and less need for interpolated cusp points, delta hinting & instructions,
    or links in this age of reason.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    hinting to OpenType PostScript fonts (eg BlueValues etc). Typelight will now also
    retain these with edited fonts.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAllan Murray"
