  body: Loose the periods between the V and I its inconsistant because you don&#39;t
    have a period after the P. Plus it will create more open space.

  body: I am assuming that you are trying to represent an equalizer reading with the
    period play, since they are such odd shapes. It&#39;s not a bad idea, but it needs
    to be exagerated more for it to work. Right now it&#39;s not easy to see, that
    is, if I&#39;m right. <BR> <BR>Steel blue is cool, but the gold pops &#40;reminds
    me of my childhood Saturday mornings, watching Solid Gold&#41;. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

  body: i&#39;d choose the black if it were me, it gives more contrast to my eye with
    the silver paired with it.
