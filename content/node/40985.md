body: "I am working on a mixed-type logotype and I was hoping for some feedback.\r\n\r\nThe
  first version is comprised of Helvetica Light and Clarendon, while the second, of
  Bodoni and Nobel Bold (I tried Futura as a more usual pair of Bodoni but the un-stemmed
  u didn't work for me).\r\n\r\nThe logo is about a photographert and it means \"light
  dark\" (or \"light shade\" as I was told). The photogrpher wants to create a mixture
  of elegance and contemporary look at the same time, and this is one of my first
  ideas (even though the selected typefaces are not that contemporary - I am still
  working on it).\r\n\r\nSo, I was hoping for some comments on the spacing and the
  typefaces combinations (and perhaps other, more contemporary suggestions)? Which
  of the two versions would you go for?\r\n\r\nThanks in advanced\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chiaroscuro_3784.png]"

  body: "Also I am not sure whether I should make another version with wider spacing
    for small sizes. Or, whether I should make the left side (the light side) bigger
    on small sizes so that it optically matches the right side, again in small sizes.
    What do you think it's best?\r\n\r\nGeorge Triantafyllakos - backpacker.gr"

  body: Chiaroscuro properly refers to the innovation in painting whereby forms were
    represented as being primarily defined by light. Historically, artistically and
    aesthetically the term is inextricably wed to the Italian Renaissance. I would
    think that your serif font selection would be an opportunity to make that connection.

  body: "I don't think it is really Italian Renaissance. Early painters who experimented
    with chiaroscuro were mostly Mannerists and Caravaggio \u2014 who has widely considered
    as the one who mastered chiaroscuro into perfection \u2014 was an early Baroque
    painter. \r\n\r\nWhile historically not quite perfect, the second logo (Bodoni
    and Nobel) in my opinion is a great example of how I would understand chiaroscuro
    in typographic terms \u2014 better than the first, because of the interesting
    two-way contrast: the weight increases while stroke modulation and design complexity
    decreases. That is more sophisticated that the first approach which really just
    says \"little\" vs \"much\" of everything. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "Though it's not exactly a Master's degree in art history, Wikipedia does
    have a thorough and accurate entry on the word:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaroscuro\r\nTo
    elaborate on my point, since the word itself actually has a technical and historical
    specificity to it\u2014the Italian Renaissance\u2014it seems that a font that
    more closely shares the same stylistic heritage as the word may be a better selection
    than a Bodoni. Just a suggestion. Personally I love that sort of thematic integration.
    \r\nAlso, there is a danger with having too great of a contrast in weight here
    in that it begins to look like two separate words."

    impression.\r\nLetters on the lft should be bigger (worth a try). Still i like
    it and hope you'll keep workin' on it."

    correct, version (Jannon T Moderne Pro Italic - Auto Black). I have to admit though
    that visually I still prefer the Bodoni-Nobel version. Anyway, my questions on
    spacing and optical corrections on small sizes, still stand ...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chiaroscuro2_6527.png]\r\n\r\nGeorge

  body: "George, \r\n\r\nI must admit that I'm a follower of the principle popularized
    by Robert Bringhurst (among others) that typographic emphasis works best if not
    too many variables are changed at a time. In your Jannon T Moderne Pro Italic
    \u2014 Auto Black I see not only the light\u2013dark opposition but also a dynamic\u2013static
    opposition due to the different inclination. \r\n\r\nI still like the Bodoni\u2013Nobel
    example best. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "I'm a nubie here,and I don't want to get into an art history debate about
    the technique, however I think that by using the heavier rich Bodoni, with the
    crispness of the Helvetica you might achieve the contrast your looking for. \r\n\r\nI
    would really like to see what the Bodoni looks like paired with the Helvetica
    Light. Curious to know if you've tried it yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nj\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi gtrianta, due to the \"chiaroscuro\" background history, my vote goes
    to the second version (Bodoni/Nobel)! But I think that can exist better alternatives
    to this logo. If you want a mixture of elegance and contemporary look, why not
    try Didot / Gotham ?\r\nI\xB4ve made the test, and look the result:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chiaro_6139.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
