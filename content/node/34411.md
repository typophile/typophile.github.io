  body: I believe it is custom. It is not Retina, which <em>is</em> HFJ and used for
    body text.

    one where they introduced the new logo. :-/\r\n\r\nUnbeige ran a couple of stories
    on it a while ago... <a href=\"http://www.mediabistro.com/unbeige/magazines/what_we_dont_know_aboutwireds_redesign_51682.asp\">here</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.mediabistro.com/unbeige/magazines/law_of_optical_volumes_finally_defined_by_wired_and_guess_what_its_kerning_58106.asp\">here</a>.
    Not a whole lot of info on the name of the custom face, though.\r\n\r\nThe second
    article links to <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2007/04/the_math_behind.html\">a
    post on Wired's blog</a> that might have more info (I don't have time to read
    it just now)."
