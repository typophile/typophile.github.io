    permed short hair, 1920s to 1950s. Clearly not from the digital font era and perhaps
    not even photo-lettering. Agree 100% with your classification as Fraktur. Very
    unusual to find sloped Fraktur script.  This is not in script section of Jaspert's
    _Type encyclopaedia (1970)_. Worth digging further.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hello!\r\nWhen I saw the posting on Briar Press, I was convinced that someone
    from the entire world would know something about this typeface, people on forums
    are usually able to solve these mysteries. So far from all the sites I posted
    the picture, just you reply in this forum.\r\nI sent a message to Mr. Unger Ralph,
    http://www.myfonts.com/person/Ralph_M_Unger/, wait for reply.\r\nKeep in touch
    and good luck!\r\n\r\nRegards!\r\nDelia Petrescu"

  body: "Slope this one and you are almost there.\r\nPlakat Fraktur. This is a Dieter
    Steffmann font so I suspect it may be a rip of digital work done by someone else.
    Need to see if we can find an assured legitimate source for the typeface.\r\n[edited]\r\nDon"

  body: "Here is Plakat Fraktur by Peter Weigel http://www.peter-wiegel.de/PlakatFraktur.html\r\nMy
    loose translation of Peter Weigel's description, which I trust is an improvement
    over the Google machine:  Poster Fraktur is a representative commercial font from
    the early 20th century. It is striking and bold, and is designed for advertising.
    I have supplemented the font with ligatures and used the UNZ1 coding. This font
    is free for personal use only. [This font is based on Deiter Steffmann's digital
    font, so I still don't know what is legitimate.]\r\nDon"
