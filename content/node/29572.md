  it in other campaigns too, and thats not ARMANI, \r\nso im guessing this isnt done
  in-house. Well known this one?\r\n\r\nThanks, and have a great weekend!\r\n\r\nMathias"

  body: This one is called Neon, as found in <em>Rookledge's International Type Finder</em>,
    page 250 (646) in the <em>Modified Sans Serif</em> category. I don't know if it
    has been digitised.

    target=\"_blank\">Neptune</a>.\r\n\r\nOn <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide03.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">this page</a> of Mike Yanega's Lined Fonts Guide you can see
    both a better showing of Neptune as well as a showing of ITC's version of Neon
    which was apparently included on the Image Club Letterpress 5.0 CD."
