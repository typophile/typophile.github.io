  where someone tries to nail down the criteria for a face being a slab-serif? \r\n\r\nA
  true formula would be extra nice. Something like \"the thickness of the serif on
  a lower-case h, from the baseline to the point at which the slop of the bracket
  is equal to zero, must constitute at least X percentage of the stroke width of the
  h's stem.\""

  body: "This was a great thread:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/30127\r\n\r\nOne
    of my posts to it seems relevant:\r\n\r\n<em>slab serif and egyptian are synonyms,</em>\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
    always beeen my understanding. I named my slab-serif take on Bodoni \u201CEgyptian\u201D
    partly for that reason, as well as others, but most logically because the serifs
    don\u2019t look at all like slabs in the Light and Thin weights.\r\n\r\nBut for
    encompassing a variety of typefaces, rather than weights, \u201CSlab\u201D is
    more practical, which is no doubt why the FontBook uses it as a category, to include
    many hefty-serifed faces (eg for news text) that are not at all \u201CEgyptian\u201D."

  body: The official rule for slab serifs (which I am about to make up) is that they
    have thick serifs, at least 50% as thick as the narrowest part of stem and other
    strokes, and no bracketting. Some people will call a Clarendon a slab serif (it
    fits, but has brackets), but they are the type of people who would steal sheep.

    the explanation of the origins of the terms grotesque, egyptian, and slab serif
    at the end of the book. With all the type designers in Boston finding a copy to
    look at should be easy."

  body: "James, that section in <em>The Nymph and the Grot</em> doesn't explain the
    origin of the term \"slab serif\" at all, taking its meaning as axiomatic.\r\n\r\nDan,
    your definition doesn't work for extra-light Egyptians, as slabs are inherently
    thick. Who's the sheep stealer now?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "So is Clarendon a slab/Egyptian then? How about New Century Schoolbook, or
    Utopia, or Font Bureau's Miller? I've seen each alternately described as a scotch
    roman, a transitional, or an Egyptian.\r\n\r\nFrankly, labels are as boring in
    typography as in life, but I suppose we need some metric to aid in compartmentalizing
    and categorizing the thousands of fonts out there nowadays....\r\n"

    my more or less  usual reference sources. I''m thinking I might have been too
    hasty in putting this to typophile, but then again, I mightn''t have found that
