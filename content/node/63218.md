  body: I think it's just Times New Roman. Was this small and printed letterpress?
    If so, the wide proportions are due to the optical adjustment they used to do
    for metal type at small sizes.

  body: "Here's Times New Roman, scaled 110% horizontally, overlaid on the sample:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/times_5112.jpg]\r\n\r\nSomething
    has added weight to it--ink or toner or something--but I still say it's TNR. I
    doubt any version of Baskerville would match this closely."
