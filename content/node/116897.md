body: "Greetings! I'm a real newbie here.\r\nI've got a homegrown font (which I didn't
  make), but need to modify. It was developed before unicode and UTF-8 allowed the
  millions of character possibilities for foreign languages. Specifically, Lithuanian.
  The Lithuanian letters were placed in un-needed places, like certain mathematical
  symbols, currency symbols, etc.\r\n\r\nIt's easy enough to take the letters and
  put them in their correct unicode places. HOWEVER, there are no unicode-defined
  characters for the Lithuanian letters with accents. How does one go about making
  this happen? I know it's possible because there are other fonts that can do it.
  If someone can help, I can explain why using these other fonts aren't a good option.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone's confused, here's an example of something we need to do. There is the \"normal\"
  ligature OE for French and Latin. It's a great example, because there is no unicode
  definition for an accented OE. For the AE ligature, there is!! How do you go about
  adding an accent mark such as     \xB4 to an oe ligature? Getting the keyboard to
  display it another thing. But that part I can handle. I just don't know how to make
  a font produce the needed glyph.\r\n\r\nAny chance of getting some help? Would be
  MOST MOST appreciated.\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Probably, since Lituanian uses free accents, if one were starting with a
    fresh sheet, the best way to handle the accents would be to use the <strong>mark</strong>
    and <strong>mkmk</strong> features of OpenType. You can read the OpenType spec
    or do a Google search for the specifics of the technique. This strategy implements
    a feature of OpenType, the only aspect affected by Unicode is that the accents
    need to be in the font, properly encoded as combining diacritics (most of which
    are found in the 0300 to 036F range).\r\n\r\nsee http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0300.pdf\r\n\r\nThe
    positioning of the accents is left to mark and mkmk.\r\n\r\nBut mark and mkmk
    do not take advantage of precomposed characters, that is, a glyph that already
    exists in a font. What you're describing in the old font seems to be exactly that,
    one where the accented characters are already \"built.\" With this approach, you
    use the ccmp feature of OpenType. Once again, the accents need to exist in the
    font as proper combining diacritics, but they are \"positioned,\" if you want,
    by having a character already composed. This character will have a *name*, but
    no Unicode number. However, it's *name* will specify the Unicode-character components.\r\n\r\nFor
    example: an m with a tilde will have, as its name, \r\nuni006D0303\r\n\r\nThe
    components have meaning: \"uni\" indicates that a Unicode number is being used
    for the name, 006D is the Unicode number for the Latin lowercase m, and 0303 is
    the Unicode number for  the tilde combining diacritic. When encountered in a text
    stream, any Unicode-savvy program or application knows exactly what is going on,
    namely, there is an m with a tilde accent over it.\r\n\r\nTo point to the characters,
    you need a ccmp feature -- again, you can look this up in the OpenType spec. The
    particular ccmp statement that will cause this precomposed character to be used
    with any application program that supports OpenType would be\r\n\r\n   sub m tildecomb
    by uni006D0303;\r\n\r\nand with the feature statement\r\n\r\nfeature ccmp { #
    Glyph Composition/Decomposition\r\n # DEFAULT\r\n   ...;\r\n   ...;\r\n   sub
    m tildecomb by uni006D0303;\r\n   ...;\r\n   ...;\r\n} ccmp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt
    all sounds harder than it actually is, primarily, I suppose, because one has to
    get into OpenType and OT features.\r\n\r\nTo use the such characters from a keyboard,
    however, is dirt simple. In either case (whether a mark or a ccmp strategy has
    been used), you simply type in the characters in sequence, the \"font\" does the
    rest. And Unicode preserves syntactic meaning for any future use of the text file.
    \r\n\r\nDo bear in mind that the combining diacritic tildecomb at U+0303 is a
    <strong>different character</strong> from the (now) spacing modifier tilde found
    in so many old PostScript Type 1 fonts. That one, which has width, maps in Unicode
    to 02DC -- a different character.\r\n\r\nHope this helps...\r\n"

  body: "Michel, the real question would be the need to encode for the diphthongs.
    Unless every occurrence of a letterpair is the diphthong in a language -- as far
    as I can tell, OpenType doesn't provide for a way to substitute \"just some.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_language#Diphthongs\r\n\r\nAs
    for new accents over Latin letters goes, I believe Unicode is on record as saying
    \"no more.\" That the font publishers do not populate the combining diacritics
    is not Unicode's fault; they have provided a mechanism within the Standard where
    syntactic meaning can be easily and always be preserved. The \"accenting\" mechanism
    itself can be done in several ways -- in the font, or \xE0 la TeX, etc. Not Unicode's
    responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I now think Unicode has gone too far. People have
    come to expect new codepoints just to provide for accented Latin letters. I use
    to be one of them until I began working with Native American languages. One begins
    to realize just how many new characters would have to be added, if each accented
    or multiple accented vowel was given it's own codepoint.\r\n\r\nFor example, I've
    been working on Kiowa lately. There would need to be over 100 new codepoints if
    all the accented vowels for just Kiowa (McKenzie orthography) were added as single
    characters...\r\n\r\n If you think on it, fully half of Latin Extended Additional
    isn't needed. Pretty much all of Latin Extended A, except for \"legacy\" reasons.\r\n"

    programs that will not correctly render characters is the problem of those programs,
    not Unicode. It would be different if NO program could properly render them. Unicode,
    in the end, is a standard, just like ASCII was.\r\n\r\nI'll allow there may be
    some confusion with the i. Maybe the answer is there, & I've missed it. Suppose
    you have an \"i\" with a macron below, a macron above, and an acute above that.
    Should the tittle (dot) show? (And isn't that a function of the language, not
    the Standard?) But given that, should the name used to deconstruct the glyph use,
    for its base character, the dotless i or the basic i? Or should it vary, depending
    on what you want the deconstructed text stream to represent? (I've put in spaces
    to make reading clearer, No spaces in the name when actually used, of course).\r\n\r\nThat
    is, be named \r\nuni0069 0331 0304 0301, or \r\nuni0131 0331 0304 0301 \r\n\r\nOr
    if the tittle is wanted, should it need to be explicit, i.e., \r\nuni 0069 0331
    0307 0304 0301 or maybe?\r\nuni 0131 0331 0307 0304 0301, where uni 0131 (whatever)
    0307 is somehow further deconstructed to uni0069?\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's the kind
    of thing the Standard is responsible for, and for all I know, it is there & I
    just missed it.\r\n\r\nNor, for that matter, does Unicode proscribe preconstructed
    glyphs -- just giving them a code point. \r\n\r\nFinally, even if they were given
    a codepoint, wouldn't the browser folk then complain about a different problem
    -- all the glyphs they now have to support, and the attending file size of each

    0307 0303        &#x0237;&#x0307;&#x0303; jdottilde\r\n\r\nWhere the components
    are:\r\n0131    latin small letter dotless i\r\n0237    latin small letter dotless
    j\r\n0301    combining acute accent\r\n0303    combining tilde\r\n0307    combining
    dot above\r\n0328    combining ogonek\r\n</PRE>\r\nThe other decompositions (for
    idotacute, idotgrave, idottilde) still work fine.\r\n\r\nI also checked that those
    are NFD and NFKD decompositions. That implies, I think, that they should pose
    no problem when transmitted on the internet. If I copy the \"composite characters\"
    above from the typophile page and paste them in MorxTester, I get back the string
    of characters. Making a keyboard for the Macintosh that outputs those strings
    of characters when you hit a key can easily be done with Ukelele. \r\n\r\nI am
    far from being convinced (that is a euphemism)  that giving \"0069 0301\" i.e.
    \"i acutecomb\" as decomposition for iacute (etc) in <a href=\"ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt\">UnicodeData.txt</a>
    was a good idea; in terms of components (and that is what is relevant with decompositions),
    iacute  should have been  given the decomposition \"0131 0301\" i.e. dotless i
    acutecomb\" etc. "

    a keyboard layout available such that, after keying the right combination, the
    character iacute is input and displayed; the input is a single character, not
    two, even if there were two strokes on the keyboard to get it. The decomposition
    has nothing to do with it. Kids need only learn to use the keyboard. Why should
    the decomposition in the file UnicodeData.txt be of any concern for kids in Africa?
    That decomposition is used, so far as I know, only by software people and font
    designers, and I think it is giving them troubles; to prove me wrong, please don't
    use an argument of authority.\r\n\r\nBy the way in TeX (and consequently LaTeX
    etc) \\i is dotless i and to get an idieresis  (i tr\xE9ma, \xEF) we (used to)
    type <code>\\\"\\i</code> which asks for a dieresis on a dotless i. Similarly
    for i circumflex. That was one of the first things we had to learn so as to be
    able to type text in French with TeX (and I know at least one colleague that still
    codes her input latex files that way, without using the package inputenc that
    allows for latin1 or utf-8 input). "

    Standard should preseve syntactic integrity of a file for all users. It doesn't

    or anywhere, but they don't use the Latin alphabet), or the most sophisticated
    New York Advertising Agency with high-dollar hardware and software.\r\n\r\nAnd
    practical things get in the way. The dotless i is in Latin extended A, and for
    ASCII, was surely <strong>not</strong> in the fixed portion 0-127. What was in
    the 8th bit was always up for grabs.\r\n\r\nSo the point is, an \"i\" with a tittle
    is better than no i at all. Whether or not the Unicode Consortium should assume
    the dotless i in all operating systems and type formats, I don't know. AFAIK,
    the only language that uses it is Turkish, for all the other, it is just assumed
    that should any accent appear over an i, the tittle is not used. So, getting back
    to the kid in Africa with the hand-out computer, what's important, in terms of
    the standard, is that he/she knows it is an \"i\" being used, not that it is rendered
    beautifully.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful rendering, as had been suggested, is the work
    of the various application programs and browsers. When there is a fault, it is
    there. However, before the people who write those programs can do their work,
    they do need to know what the standard is, and I'm not sure the Unicode Consortium
    has made that clear. Anyone know that information?"
