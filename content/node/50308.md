  OT ligature substitution feature seems to be working just fine in my OpenType PS
  generation for the mac.\r\n\r\nDo I need to figure out unicodes for these glyphs?\r\n\r\nIf
  so, how do I figure that out? FontLab's \"Glyph Names/Generate Unicode\" doesn't
  do anything."

    want to do that I don't see in the fonts I own.\r\n\r\nLike a tabular Euro and
    Yen. Where do I find unicodes for things like this? \r\n\r\nR\\V"

  body: Many glyphs, particularly those used as "destination" forms of OpenType features
    (i.e. your 'f_y', 'f_f_y' and tabular Euro), do not (and will not, and should
    not) have Unicodes assigned.

  body: Indeed, the only ligatures/digraphs that have Unicode numbers assigned are
    those grandfathered in from earlier encoding schemes or those that have special
    orthographic significance in certain languages.

  body: However, some rendering systems have trouble with glyphs that are not assigned
    Unicode points. (They really shouldn't, but it's a problem that exists). In those
    situations, you can assign them a number of your choice from the Private Use Area.

  body: "For all glyphs that are not default representations of characters that are
    part of the Unicode Standard, you can pick any PUA (Private Use Area) codepoint
    from the range U+E000 to U+F8FF. You can enable the appropriate option in FontLab
    Studio's Glyph / Glyph Names / Generate Unicode to do it automatically. \r\n\r\nA."
