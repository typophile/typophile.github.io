body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nMy name is Fredo Viola.  I'm a multi-media artist preparing
  a series of releases on the French/UK-based Indie label \"Because.\"  (Because has
  Klaxxons, Justice, Charlotte Gainsbourg and a bunch of other very interesting artists
  on it's roster.) \r\n\r\nI'm looking to hire a designer to do one and maybe two
  things for this release.  The first and most pressing is I need a logo of my name
  designed based on a very old German hand-painted drawing.  After that, and this
  job could take a lot longer, I am looking to hire somebody to create a font based
  on the typeface painted into this poster as well.\r\n\r\nThis is not an amateur
  project, nor a student work, and there is a budget.  Please, if you are interested
  and available and would like to discuss it further please email me at fredo@fredoviola.com\r\n\r\nIf
  you are interested in hearing or seeing any of my work you can check out my website:
  \ http://www.fredoviola.com\r\n\r\nThanks very much.\r\n\r\nWarmest regards,\r\nFredo
  Viola"
