body: "My headline is in Engravers MT (not Gothic, St, Regular or Roman, etc.). I
  would greatly appreciate a suggestion for a full bodied, serif font that would allow
  me a full paragraph and several weights in sentence case that could substitute out
  this font. Engravers MT offers lovely, distinguished, old-fashioned serifs that
  create a vintage feel. I have found Narziss and Promotor, but I think one or two
  of these are free and have no varying weights, which is key. \r\n\r\n "

    so much! \r\n\r\n(Clarendon is a bit too mid-century, need to stay in the late
