  body: "Whatever this is, it's nicely designed,in my opinion. All I can say is that
    it doesn't seem to be at the MyFonts site, or they didn't categorize it as \"curly\".\r\n\r\nThe
    most similar font I can suggest is Edison Swirl, an Art Nouveau-era design that
    has digital versions from both [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/edison/|HiH,
    as \"Edison\"]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/edison-swirl-sg/|Spiece

  body: "It is very hard to find!  I checked most of the MyFonts site, and couldn't
    find anything, thanks for the similar suggestions.\r\n\r\nBut what about the \"slide
    to unlock\" and date font?  They seem to have a whisping quality to them. Most
    noticeably on the \"d, e, c\" letters. Could be the same font for both. I would
    think that \"e\" and \"c\" would be the most recognizable characters of the set.\r\n\r\nMost
    beautiful font I have seen. The author of the theme will not return my emails.

  body: I added a second image, although the text is pretty small. Some more key letters
    are shown.

  body: "Nice work Jim. They categorized it under 'Gothic'.  Hmmm. I don't think I
    ever would have looked there.\r\n\r\nFlorian, \"Times New Roman\"? It looks completely
    hand-drawn to me, but the more I look at it, I can see why you'd say that. The
    proportions are pretty much TNR and the skeleton core of each letter, with the
    exception of a few letters, also seems to follow TNR's shapes. I can see you making
    the overlays now, that show how the wispy, curly serifs are the main thing that
    were changed.\r\n\r\nThat being the case, if they gave prizes for the most creative
    font based on Times New Roman, this would be a contender in my book.\r\n\r\n-
