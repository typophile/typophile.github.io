  and formatted the times in this method: hh:mm xx,(4:50 pm)\r\n\r\nMy client wants
  the times to all be in this format: hh:mm X.X. (4:50 P.M.)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I
  cringe at the thought of visually disturbing the flow of the text like that, but
  it made me wonder.\r\n\r\nWhat is the proper way, I know all forms xx, x.x., XX,
  and X.X. are accepted, but what is the most widely accepted, what do you as designers
  do, and are there prominent examples of use?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your insight
  on this matter, I never considered that I didn't know this before."

    I have a customer who runs for The Chicago Manual of Style every time I make a
    style decision like this. CMoS goes with a.m. and p.m. So, she comes running to
    me waving the examples in 9.42. She never looked carefully enough to see the \"often
    appear in small capitals..., in which case periods are unnecessary.\"\r\n\r\nYou

    bad form to omit the full stops from \"a.m.\" Why? Because while \"a.m.\" and
    \"p.m.\" are used in English, both are also used in Irish, and \"am\" is a noun
    meaning 'time' in Irish. So for consistency (particularly in light of bilingual
    invitations and so on) \"a.m.\" is recommended here.\r\n\r\nIn Irish \"roimh n\xF3in\"
    and \"iarn\xF3in\" are also used for \"before noon\" and \"afternoon\"; the abbreviations

    Seems like redundant formatting. Wouldn't that be akin to underlining <em>and</em>
    italicizing titles, or spacing out <em> and</em> indenting paragraphs? Would you
    set "The NASA launch is set for 10:30A.M." (with NASA and A.M. all in small caps)?

  body: "I'm not sure I can justify this any better to my friend the art history prof
    than by saying \"After many years this is what I prefer.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe on the
    grounds of disambiguation: the periods prevent \"A.M.\" from becoming \"AM,\"
    which is a word. I know, I know: in books for readers with any degree of smart
    much beyond a brick, this will not be an issue; they'll dig that it is time we
    are talking about here, not a state of existence. \r\n\r\nMaybe for some the periods
    \"stop the flow.\" Not for me.\r\n\r\nDez's dubble-period example is indeed horrid.
    But he needn't worry. In this case the period serves equally as part of the abbreviation
    and as the sentence terminal. You could look that up in Chicago at 9.42 (\"The
    first train leaves at 5:22 a.m. and the last at 11:00 p.m.\").\r\n\r\nWhich leads
    me to say, once again: Following Chicago or Bringhurst should always take second
    place to our own well-considered ideas of what helps a page. As long as they are
    indeed \"well-considered.\"\r\n\r\nHorrid also is the lack of a space following
    the hour number. \r\n\r\npowers"

    different persepctives on it.\r\n\r\nSome more specific information about the
    actual situation I'm dealing with right now.  I am making a flyer equivalent to
    a conference schedule for a series of training sessions happening at a college
    here in my town.  Space is at a premium and the chart has to fit within the width
    of a standard letter-sized sheet.\r\n\r\nI haven't be fortunate to have the shortest
    workshop names, and the names on the chart are literally usually half of the actual
    full name of each session already!\r\n\r\nI put the format as <em>'5:00 pm'</em>
    and my supervisor requested <em>'5:00 P.M.'</em> \"because that's the proper way
    to do it, and also to change the times throughout the body copy to that format
    as well to be consistent.\"\r\n\r\nI can understand including the 'pm' so people
    don't show up at 5 am to the college, but I think making the times that big and
    spaced out will ultimately break the flow of the chart, and if I do it my way
    in the chart, I must remain constant throughout the whole document.\r\n\r\nI am
    using Myriad Pro SemiCondensed, which unfortunately, doesn't have Small Caps that

    was one we both like, and the semi-condensed allowed us to save as much space
    as we could per line, without being too small and condensed to read.\r\n\r\nI
    have checked out Stone Sans, and I do like it, but I don't think I have the liberty
    of using it here unfortunately.\r\n\r\nI'm also worried, she wants me to create
    a power-point template using MSoffice fonts and I'm pretty sure she's going to
    revert back to using Trebuchet for all of her on-screen work.  I like the feel
    of Lucida Sans but I don't know what to tell her to use for on-screen and web
