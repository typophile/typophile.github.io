  body: ' Not quite. &#34;Grotesque&#34; is used in the &#34;primeval&#34; sense of
    the word, from the Italian &#39;grottesco&#39; &#40;&#34;of a grotto.&#34;&#41;
    Grotesque types were so named at the beginning of the nineteenth century because
    of the vogue for antiquity -- the Napoleonic conquest of Egypt ended in these
    years, and the craze for antiquities led manufacturers of all sorts to attach
    ancient sounding names to anything novel. Different typefounders chose their own
    historical names for this new sans serif style, among them &#34;Egyptian,&#34;
    &#34;Doric,&#34; &#34;Antique,&#34; and &#34;Gothic.&#34; The last two terms live
    on to this day, e.g. &#34;Franklin Gothic.&#34; <BR> <BR>Most of the new type
    styles developed during these years have antique names, too: slab-serif &#34;Egyptians,&#34;
    wedge-seriffed &#34;Latins,&#34; bracketed-seriffed &#34;Ionics,&#34; floriated
    &#34;Tuscans,&#34; octagonal &#34;Grecians,&#34; inverted &#34;Italians,&#34;
    and so on. <BR> <BR>For more on all of this, read James Mosley&#39;s &#34;The
    Nymph and the Grot,&#34; an essay now expanded and thankfully republished by the
    Friends of St Bride a few years ago. '

  body: ' A tangential question: <BR> <BR>What to call a serif like in Charter? Jim
    Parkinson has been using &#34;Latin&#34; to cover that type of serif &#40;look
    at the description for his wonderful Azuza&#41;, but to me a Latin serif is pointy,
    not sheared off bluntly on the sides. But neither can it be called a slab, because
    there is a definite tilt. <BR> <BR>&#34;Slab Latin&#34;? <BR> <BR>hhp '
