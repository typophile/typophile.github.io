  feature to a font? &#40;See the circled panel in the screenshot below for Hoefler
  Text.&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/33144.gif"
  alt="Glyph Variant Screenshot"> <BR> <BR><a href="http://developer.apple.com/fonts/Registry/index.html">Apple&#39;s
  docs</a> are far from clear on how to add this. In the Morph Input File &#40;MIF&#41;,
  I have used &#34;Character Alternates&#34; &#40;Namecode 17, also visible as a closed
  panel in the screen shot above&#41; to define sets of alternate glyphs, but that
  doesn&#39;t give me the fancy pop-ups that are context-sensitive to the selected
  characters, only radio buttons to identify alternate character sets. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
  appreciate any tips. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Brent

    This table includes a mapping between glyphs and all variants. <BR> <BR>See: <a

    and &#39;Zapf&#39; tables? If you compare creating typographic OT features with
    FontLab and typographic AAT features with command line tool provided by Apple,
    it&#39;s not strange, that hardly nobody is working with AAT fonts. Am I right?'

  body: 'I think you are right Juhani, and have been telling Apple this for years.
    The Apple font tools are designed by engineers for engineers. I&#39;ve done work
    with them, but not by choice: the client needed AAT tables in the font. Even then,
    we had to have Dave Opstad &#40;ex-Apple font guy&#41; help us with the state
    tables for contextual substitutions. I understand the tools have improved a bit
    since then, but they&#39;re still nothing like as easy as making OT in FontLab
    or VOLT, nor even as easy as making a Graphite font with SIL&#39;s own text based
    tools.'
