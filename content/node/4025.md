  body: Fallen Angel, the only typeface I know of that slightly  <BR>resembles your
    sample is Carlos Segura&#39;s <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?49Z" target="_blank">
    Neo Bold</a>.  <BR>Unfortunately it looks like it&#39;s not available anymore,  <BR>as
    are quite a number of <a href="http://www.t26.com/" target="_blank"> T-26</a>
    early output. <BR> <BR>Dan, please be courteous to our visitors. I&#39;m sure
    you  <BR>meant it as a joke, but still...

  body: Fallen Angel -- I can&#39;t seem to find anything that would give you a good
    head start. Is it the blackletter feeling that you like about it? You could do
    a search for <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=evil" target="_blank">EVIL</a>
    at myfonts. <BR> <BR>=== <BR> <BR>FYI -- I was a vampire &#40;and Lestat my true
    love&#41; in my previous life &#40;or at least during my early twenties&#41;.
