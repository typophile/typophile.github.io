body: "I'm looking to find a software program to preview fonts that does not require
  the font to be loaded/activated. The trouble is I have had frequent crashes where
  the Suitcase database was lost along with all my sorts. Pleasure and pain. SOOO,
  TypoWiki says FontExplorer X works like iTunes. \r\n\r\n1. Can you sort fonts within
  the application and have them change directories on the hard drive? \r\n\r\n2. Does
  FontExplorer X preview fonts without activating?\r\n\r\n3. Unfortunately I'm still
  on OS 10.2.8, Is there an older version that is compatable? OR, Must I scratch up
  the $50 and upgrade my OS R-I-G-H-T N-O-W! I-M-M-E-D-I-A-T-E-L-Y! ETC.\r\n\r\nBest,
  Christian"

  body: "FontExplorer also has to perform a \"stealth\" activation in order to preview
    a font. If the font doesn't work in one font manager, it's likely that it won't
    work in another. I suggest trying it. \r\n\r\nIf you're using 10.2.8, then you
    can't use FontExplorer, or for that matter Suitcase Fusion. Both Suitcase X1 and
    Fusion have corruption scanning/repair built in, but those features are not enabled
    by default. \r\n\r\nA cheap, temporary workaround would be to try using the font
    in the system. Place the folder in /Users/(your username)/Library/Fonts/ and restart
    your applications. I would test the font carefully, since your previous problems
    have made it suspect. Unmodified fonts from reputable foundries rarely cause problems.\r\nOther
    than that, I would highly recommend an update to Mac OS 10.4.\r\n"

      think what I'll do is copy my Suitcase font sort to Word. Then I can check this
      against my hard drive. If I have a crash I can simply drag and drop the hard
      drive contents to restore the Suitcase database. And it would give me a hard
      copy of all my fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments,\r\nXtian"
