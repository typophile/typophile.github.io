		<div class="commentbody">It will probably never become somthing that is good for more that 4 or five words on maybe a slightly longer book title. But you could attempt to make it a little easier to read. And a lower case would round it out nicely. However, I am having trouble assessing what I think because the rendering of each glyph is sort of small. The way you handle the slightly curved portions isn&rsquo;t that clear as it is. Can you post a few letters 300% larger? Or post a PDF?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is new bigger file attached to first post.
Unfortunatelly you&rsquo;re right with the length. Bigger looks better indeed, haven&rsquo;t thought about that before. Anyway I have no clear idea for lower case. As I said I have no experience on that field so it comes to me quite difficult to imagine possible changes/improvements.
I have played with A a little bit, although it does not look as I initially wanted to (it all started from letter A) but it looks better I think.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Now I can see what happening I do have several things to offer you: take them or not.</p>
<p>I am not sure that I like the &lsquo;bitten&rsquo; quality of some of the openings where one shape has been cut from another. Some places like the upper end of low tail of the the L seem to benefit from this approach. But the bottom of your M it seems like a problem. And I don&rsquo;t know if it helps the opening under the A either.</p>
<p>Maybe instead of making the R so round you should bring the arm in. Or cut a bite in the right side.</p>
<p>I would like to see the Y being built out of the forms I see in the D. That vertical width.</p>
<p>Looking at the comma I wonder if it can be at an angle, why not the arm of the R? Or maybe the comma should be build up from squares too&hellip;</p>
<p>This is all to suggest that there are many more ways of making these forms &amp; that I want to encourage you to keep trying things. I think you might try 3 or 4 more possibilities for each letter and look for ways of creating a bit more harmony between them. There is always going to be some tension in a font like this between the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; you have set for yourself to build the font &amp; the needs of the eye. When in doubt - go with the eye.</p>
<p>I hope this is helpful.</p>
