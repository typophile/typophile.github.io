  place.  myself and couple of friends r planning to do freelance works in areas of
  webdesigning, architecture visualization, corporate presentations, 3d modelling
  (animation also after a while), and stuff like that.\r\n\r\nname is rna graphix.
  and here r the initial ideas i've done in photoshop. am not much into logo designing
  stuff but wanted to try.  need ur critiques and suggestions. the font i used is
  helvetica.\r\n\r\ni wanted the logo to go well into 3d also so that i can make animation
  for it.  \r\n\r\nc&c welcome\r\n\r\nregards,\r\nSravan"

  body: "I'd suggest having either the initial device <em>or</em> the painterly 'x'.
    Having both is like 'too much of a good thing' - it distracts the eye and reduces
    the overall impact of the logo.\r\n\r\nEither on their own with a couple of tweaks
    and refinements would give a nice logo.\r\n\r\n--\r\nAegir"

  body: "I have to agree with Aegir, it is either or. Personally, i would drop the
    'fancy' X and go for the mark. Once this is refined, it could work really well.
    Good luck and looking forward to seeing any progress you make. \r\n\r\n-\r\nSeb"

  body: "I agree with losing the graphic X. \r\n\r\nIn fact, IMHO, I would lose the
    X all together and spell \"graphics\" - the X is grossly overused today and I
    feel that it takes away from the professionalism of the company. But that's just
    me, so I'm not saying I'm right.\r\n\r\nThe type compliments the mark well. I
    like the square logo, as it reminds me of the stamped initials on old Chinese
    artwork - yet it retains a modern technological feel."

  body: "seb, sch2525\r\n\r\nthnx for ur comments. i dropped the idead of 'X'. it
    looks good now. didn't change anything regarding the type. \r\n\r\nhere's few
    more drafts i worked out. (got inspired by the Typophile logo ). i tried rounded
    corners too. need ur opinion on the new ones. and tell me which looks good. old
    one? or new one (the typophile logo inspired one)\r\n\r\nedit:\r\noops! there

    I personally HATE the fact you've decided to spell graphics with an x, but that's
    probably just me.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul

  body: I've seen places that have done "grafix" and not thought it was improper.  So
    long as it's done well, I don't have a lot of problems.  FWIW, I like the one
    at the bottom best....
