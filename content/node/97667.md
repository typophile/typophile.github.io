  you can see from the screen shot, this font which I localized into Turkish has a
  mysterious padding from the bottom. I couldnt achieve in adjusting it after playing
  with the font info settings. Anyone have a solution is needed. Best regards.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n"

    provide more information or show with an example of text generated with the font?

  body: "What you are seeing is the result of how the Fonts Window displays glyphs.
    That the glyphs have apparently been moved up in this display will most likely
    be the result of how the metrics are set up, specifically the ascender and descender
    measurements relative to the overall size of the glyph.\r\n\r\nFrom your screenshot
    the descender is currently set to -300 and the glyph itself seems to reach a height
    of 1000, which in a font with a UPM of 1000 would be 300 more than the standard
    ascender height (which should equal 1000). As the ascender height is not visible
    in the glyph window this would indicate that it might be even higher than 1000,
    which could distort things further. Inconsistent metrics may cause problems when
    using the font in some applications, as such you could look at compensating for
    this by reducing the size of the glyphs and correcting the metrics relative to
    the UPM or you could expand the UPM and then check the relative metrics.\r\n\r\nKarsten
    Luecke's [[http://www.kltf.de/downloads/FontMetrics-kltf.pdf|guide to font metrics]]
    (this may trigger an automatic download depending on your browser) is a very useful
    guide for understanding this.\r\n\r\nIf you can provide screenshots of the following
    windows for the font I might be able to suggest relevant adjustments:\r\n\r\nFont
    Info>Metrics and Dimensions\r\nFont Info>Metrics and Dimensions>Key Dimensions\r\nFont
    Info>Metrics and Dimensions>TrueType-specific metrics"

  body: "Based on the metrics information in your screen grabs I would recommend rationalising
    the metrics either to the existing 1000 UPM setting or moving to a 2000/2048 UPM
    setting in line with generating a Windows TrueType or OpenType-TrueType font.
    It looks like the Key Dimensions are based on a TrueType metrics set-up which
    may mean that you have FontLab set-up to convert fonts to 1000 UPM when they are
    opened (Preferences>Opening OpenType & TrueType - \"Scale the font to 1000 UPM\"
    tick box).\r\n\r\nI would recommend updating the metrics overall before generating
    the final font as you may encounter problems with some applications otherwise."

  body: "Looking at the current settings it looks like the computer key shape was
    aligned to the x-height of the font (1004). With that in mind you could consider
    amending the metrics as below:\r\n\r\n<strong>Font Info > Metrics and Dimensions</strong>\r\nChange
    the UPM size to 2000.\r\n\r\n<strong>Font Info > Metrics and Dimensions > Key
    Dimensions</strong>\r\nChange the fields as follows:\r\nAscender: 1800\r\nDescender:
    -200\r\nCaps height: 1708 (unchanged)\r\nx height: 1004 (unchanged)\r\n\r\n<strong>Font
    Info > Metrics and Dimensions > TrueType-specific metrics</strong>\r\nChange the
    fields as follows:\r\nTypoAscender: 1800\r\nTypoDescender: -200\r\nTypeLineGap:
    0\r\nWinAscent: 1800\r\nWinDescent: -200\r\n\r\nAscender: 1800\r\nDescender: -200\r\nLineGap:
    0\r\n\r\nThis is just a suggestion but this would optimise your metrics if you
    are generating a TrueType font. If you would prefer to generate an OpenType Postscript
    font with a 1000 UPM set-up you could try the following:\r\n\r\n<strong>Font Info
    > Metrics and Dimensions</strong>\r\nLeave the font's UPM size as 1000.\r\n\r\n<strong>Font
    Info > Metrics and Dimensions > Key Dimensions</strong>\r\nChange the fields as
    follows:\r\nAscender: 1000\r\nDescender: 0\r\nCaps height: 800\r\nx height: 500\r\n\r\n<strong>Font
    Info > Metrics and Dimensions > TrueType-specific metrics</strong>\r\nChange the
    fields as follows:\r\nTypoAscender: 1000\r\nTypoDescender: 0\r\nTypeLineGap: 200\r\nWinAscent:
    1100\r\nWinDescent: -100\r\n\r\nAscender: 1100\r\nDescender: -100\r\nLineGap:
    0\r\n\r\nThese settings will satisfy FontLab's requirements and hopefully satisfy
    most applications that require standardised metrics settings, though others may
    have better suggestions."
