body: Hi <BR> <BR>I was wondering if anyone can help. I need to type fractions like
  1/72nd and 1/43rd in the traditional manner. Does anybody know of a sans serif font
  that would allow me to do this? I&#39;m using Din for body text but the font doesn&#39;t
  have to match exactly. <BR> <BR>Thanks.
