  New York subway signs.\r\nI think they're pretty well done, in terms of typography
  choice.\r\n\r\nCan anyone identify the possible typefaces used?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.etsy.com/shop/FlyingJunction?ref=seller_info]]\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "The originals weren't even typefaces, they where hand lettering...\r\nBut
    these reproductions use a couple of different typefaces which mimics the effects
    quite well...\r\n\r\nYes for Akzidenz, thanks.\r\n\r\nAny others?"
