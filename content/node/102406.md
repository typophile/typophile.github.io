    the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule|Carolingian Miniscule]]:\r\n\r\n<em>\u201CThe
    script ultimately developed from Roman half uncial and its cursive version, which
    had given rise to various Continental minuscule scripts, which were combined with
    features from the \"Insular\" scripts that were being used in Irish and English
    monasteries.\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nThe quill pen was cut so it provided a flat area.
    Due to the position of the right hand, the quilt\u2019s tip was causing an angled
    stroke, which provided strong strokes downwards and softer strokes sideways, although
    the goal was probably to keep both strokes equal in force.\r\n\r\nThe minuscle
    \u201Ct\u201D derives from the <em>Roman Capitalis</em> \u201CT\u201D, and the
    first stroke of the quill was downwards, followed by the second stroke sideways
    from left to right. Slight inaccuracy caused a little bump on the top where the
    T-downstroke began, which led to the slightly crossed shape. The sail shape in
    serif fonts, as you have shown it, is a result of both angled strokes melting
    into one area at some point of type development. Just like the curve at the bottom
    of the lowercase \u201Ct\u201D and the lowercase \u201Ca\u201D derives from swift
    motions when writing minuscule scripts."

    I prefer to write the horizontal stroke first (no matter if I write T or t). Doing
    so, I can more easily avoid the vertical stroke causing a bump in the horizontal
    one that the other way round. Also I think it it is easier to find the right starting
    point for the horizontal stroke than for the vertical stroke of T or t, because
    the further I am away from the preceding letter, the more I have to guess about
    the size of the inter-character space."
