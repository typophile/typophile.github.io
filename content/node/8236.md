    a small town nearby, so they are trying to benefit from a natural/traditional

  body: The first design is more memorable and fits their traditional image. I like
    the butterfly with the type- it works well. The only thing is- if you use the
    stroke under the copy, I would merge it with the &#34;j&#34; and make them relate
    to the butterfly more. Maybe have it be the butterfly trail instead of it being
    random.

  body: Hector your stuff is great as usual. My only comment is you don&#39;t need
    the hypen in any version. Any of them is a winner

  body: As Daniel implied, I believe any of these three concepts could translate well
    onto a milk carton/container. If you want to pitch one of them over the others
    you should help the decision makers visualize what you have imagined. Create some
    comps or even mock ups of the applied logo

  body: Hector, I like 1, 2, and 4. The &#39;g&#39; in the third one makes a shape
    I find unsettling for a reason I can&#39;t pin down. This may go away once it&#39;s
    in color. Perhaps the &#39;V&#39; and &#39;a&#39; are too horizontal for my taste.
    I get the impression that Villagranja has wilted or flopped over the bottom storey
    of the &#39;g&#39;.

    I immediately thought &#34;high quality dairy products.&#34;  Maybe it could be
    used as a companion face to your delicious logo. <BR> <BR>//john

  body: 'What&#39;s special about this milk? Anything that makes it unique? The only
    milk packaging that won me over purely on the packaging was Schroeders: <BR> <BR><a

    <BR> <BR>Otherwise, IMHO, milk is milk. It&#39;s from BST animals or it isn&#39;t.
    It&#39;s organic or it isn&#39;t.  <BR> <BR>So, I&#39;m not helping much, but
    I guess my point is that if this brand needs to stick out, it really needs to
    be immensly different than the norm, or it needs to emphasize the unique properties
    of the milk. <BR> <BR>As for what you have, I really like the last one visually.
    But tend to agree that the hyphen isn&#39;t needed.'

  body: I like the concept of the butterfly but feel that if you&#39;re going to connect
    the curved rule to the lc &#39;j&#39;, that the butterfly might need to be altered
    to serve as a more effective dot
