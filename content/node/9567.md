  but still no clues as to the typeface. Its the swirly one im after with the  distinctive
  CAPS characters S, N, Y and  R. Also if anyone has any ideas on the LVY INGER typeface
  it would be much appreciated! Thanks<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66573.gif"

  body: It appears to be some form of Garamond Swash Italic. I have the BE version
    and there are many simularities but also some differences. I know this will be
    solved pretty quickly.

  body: It&#39;s not Garamond or Caslon, though those are close. The exact font used
    here is <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/hoeflertext/index.html" target="_blank">Hoefler
    Text</a>.

  body: It seems that certain Hoefler fonts &#40;Hoefler Text, Requiem&#41; regularly
    stump people here. Maybe &#39;cause they&#39;re not on MyFonts? :-&#41;

  body: That&#39;s a good observation Mark. It seems to have become our resource of
    choice, doesn&#39;t it? Whenever we get stumped I start trying to think of what
    ISN&#39;T at MyFonts, and go looking there.
