  dental equipment. Can someone suggest a rather slim and corporate font?\r\n\r\nRight
  now I'm working with FF Clan Pro, which is also featured as headline her :-)\r\n\r\nCheers

  body: "I've gotten an odd rush of dental-related business work recently, and used
    Gotham for one (a dental technology company) and an all caps treatment with Hypatia
    Sans for the other (which I'll admit is partially because I was trying to find
    an application for it where every designer on the planet didn't say \"hey, that's
    the freebie font from CS3!\").\r\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of the lowercase set of
    Hypatia Sans but the uppercase characters are actually surprisingly nice.\r\n"
