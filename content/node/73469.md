  Ideas</cite> series and a recent re-reading of parts of <cite>The Order of Things</cite>
  I put together a preliminary cover design for Foucault's book. I'll try to make
  some test prints tomorrow so I thought I'd ask what people around here think about
  it. The project is intended purely for my fun and the annoyance of friends I keep
  showing it to.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fou_v1_mod_resize_4660.jpg]"

  body: I think you need to ask yourself what is the purpose of subcapping and shrinking
    the first three letters before some of the words--for me, the concept fell flat.
    Moreover, the "not yet" to me struck out as reminiscent of the Harry Potter font.

  body: "Thanks for your comment. You're right about the HP font, I haven't noticed
    that.\r\nThe idea behind setting (some of) the Latin prefixes in sub/superscript
    lowercase was mainly just space management. I wanted the text to look uneven partly
    because of the 'wrinkledness', referred to in the quote, and partly because a
    large part of the book is about the impossibility of classification, i.e. of subsuming
    particular instances under a general concept (or in this case, of forcing text
    or language into a strict grid)."

  body: "It could work. But either I would research more on the style of abbreviations
    of olde (which, perhaps isn't so appropriated given the author and the matter)*,
    or spend some more time trying to use them in order to highlight the most relevant
    parts of the quotation.\r\n\r\n* Then, again, it could be appropriated in showing
    some sort of \"wrinkle\" which already disappeared."

  body: "Thanks for your comment. The original idea was actually to follow your second
    suggestion but sadly I ran out of ideas after 'wrinkle'. Another plan was to focus
    typographically on 'man' (who is after all the hero of the sentence) and then
    gradually 'fade out' toward the end of the quote. In the end I abandoned that
    one because it would look too similar to Chip Kidd's <cite>The Original Of Laura</cite>
    cover.\r\nI attach picures of a slightly modified version of the original as it
    looks printed, and a typographically rather different approach.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/v1-3a_5183.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/v2-1a_4628.jpg]"
