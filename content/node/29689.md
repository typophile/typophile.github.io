  font also exists under a different name?"

  body: "Actually, Charme and Slogan are not the same typeface. Helmut Matheis designed
    both a year apart. First there was Charme (1957) and then the heavier version
    (1958), which he (or the Ludwig & Mayer foundry) called Slogan. Slogan, however,
    has a very different D, I, J, V and W.\r\n\r\nThe Paratype website credits Slogan
    as the basis for Corrida, but its caps that I've listed above are partly from
    Slogan and partly from a bold Charme.\r\n\r\nCredit goes to Philippe of the Myfonts
    forum for the historical info."
