  body: 'Have a look at Bringhurst''s ''Elements of Typographic Style''. He has a
    table, based on the widely accepted idea that 2 1/2 lc alphabets is the maximum
    optimal measure for single column pages. That can be stretched with additional
    leading. When a column gets too narrow in multi-column layouts, then you either
    have problems with spacing or the ''rag''. But the best thing is to try it with
    the typeface and size you have in mind. The thing is to find the mixture of point
    size, leading, measure and margins that work together. And as Stephen indicates,
    there''s no formula for that; the ''eyes'' have it. '

  body: "I don't know if this is of any use to you, but one bit of wisdom that is
    always passed around is that there should be no more than 10 to 12 words per line
    (or 50 to 60 characters), because this is what the human eye is comfortable with.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, everything already said above also applies -- if you are working on a
    letter-size page broken up into four columns of text, the words per line will
    probably be less than 10 to 12. "
