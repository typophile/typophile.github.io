  tonight and use it in both iOS and OS X.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Speaking of typography,
  I expect the system font to change for the first time since Mac OS X 10.0 back in
  2001. (If you want to be pedantic, Lucida Grande has been the system font since
  the public beta release in 2000.) Helvetica Neue is the obvious choice, since that\u2019s
  what iOS uses. The wildcard would be Apple Sans (perhaps with a new name), a new
  typeface Apple has been designing in-house for years. (And if OS X switches to Apple
  Sans, maybe iOS 8 will too.) Bottom line, though, I think we\u2019ve seen the last
  of Lucida Grande. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nhttp://daringfireball.net/2014/06/wwdc_2014_prelude\r\n\r\nAnyone
  have any intel on if Apple has typographers in-house?"

    and Microsoft's Arial is. :)

    you know what Chalkboard is a clone of. Hmm... maybe not such a comic sitch, after
    all.

  body: Well, they dum. The thing is, Hrant, this issue of what da Mac uses for fonts
    is just not that important. A agree dat it's not sew goode at reelie small sizes,
    and that it don't hilp the font industree to reheat helitican over and over, until
    it's like an invisible background for all the complex typographic content  brought
    to u by an OS,, oh maybe dare is a reason. Be sides witch, I don't think a change
    of fonts is going to git eor stub urn hide into a apple cart en e way. Em eye
    write or em I rite?

  body: "There are, perhaps, over all the devices 1,000's of \"conditions\" in the
    OS alone and even more once the fonts are employed by apps. Together, this builds
    and OS's typography out of space, time, color and fonts. Having only seen nips
    of this preview of perhaps the new OS, is a weakness we all share. And that alone
    requalifies every opinion I've heard. Some of us, have other weaknesses, like
    never having worked on one, much less multiple OS typographies, for predicable
    brand disloyalty, and yet others have delusions of miasma in the plasma...\r\n\r\nThe
    Fast Co. piece is fascinating in that it raises two questions with descendant
    questions here at FB, that've been asked even before Lucida Grande, and are asked
    in the development of all RE fonts; When designing scalable digital outline fonts,
    when should the style be compromised for the size and when should the style be
    compromised for the resolution, and how? and the other question of course, is;
    When'll type designers be able to productize this knowledge in size and resolution
    independent digital outline fonts that can react to conditions in the user's favor,
    so we do not have to \"simplify\" every class of every typeface design for each
    size and for each resolution? ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
