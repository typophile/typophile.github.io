  is poopy poop. So hopefully the beautiful minds of <BR>Adam Twardoch and Thomas
  Phinney are tuned in... <BR> <BR>What are the chances that FontLab could license
  and incorporate  <BR>InDesign&#39;s optical kerning technology and use it in place
  of the <BR>rather useless auto-kern feature? It could offer a great starting <BR>point
  for kerning work and with some fine-tuning controls &#40;such  <BR>as locking control
  characters, specifying a typeface&#39;s optimum  <BR>size, and the creation of chains
  of similar shapes for consistency&#41;  <BR>take a lot of the hard labor out of
  font production. <BR> <BR>What do you think? Am I out of my technolovin&#39; mind?

  body: 'Steve, I&#39;ve actually talked to Adam about this. <BR> <BR>Here are some
    things to consider: <BR>1&#41; Indy&#39;s Optical spacing is bilinear - a flat
    segment between 4 and 12, another between 12 and 72. They did this to reduce the
    impact on performance. An ideal version of the algorithm would be on a smooth
    &#40;possibly quadratic&#41; curve. <BR>2&#41; The spacing depends on point size.
    <BR>3&#41; I think the algorithm discards the base spacing info when it does its
    thing. This would mean it can&#39;t simply replace the kerning in a font. <BR>
    <BR>I think it would be nice to include the technology at the font app level &#40;95%
    of fonts would end up with better spacing&#41;, but actually if you don&#39;t
    mind reverse-engineering it you don&#39;t need a license: you just set all pairs
    of characters, get Indy to do its thing, output a PDF, then take &#40;automated&#41;
    measurements between all the characters. For a give target point size though.

  body: Sorry, Stephanopolis. <BR> <BR>1&#41; There are people who think they can
    do better than Indy&#39;s spacing? Yeah, Carter. Actually, it&#39;s not <i>that</i>
    good, but it&#39;s still better than what 90% of designers seem to manage. <BR>3&#41;
    I guess you could write code that subtracts the human-determined sidebearings
    from Indy&#39;s inter-character values, using those for kerning. The problem is
    you&#39;d end up with too many pairs. So you need a cutoff. Or you could write
    code that optimizes the base spacing itself by looking at what Indy has done -
    but then you&#39;re getting into a complexity that would make simply licensing
    sensical anyway &#40;and you might still need a cutoff&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; a
    value shows up in the kerning window <BR> <BR>But that could just be calculated
    based on the old default spacing values - it doesn&#39;t mean the algorithm is
    using the original sidebearings. <BR> <BR>That said, no, I&#39;m not sure at all.

    than that, I believe Hrant is dead on. I don&#39;t think the original sidebearings
    have much effect on how the spacing ends up. <BR> <BR>I happen to have had some
    other questions about optical kerning recently, from somebody doing a book on
    typography, so I am off to learn more so I can better answer these sorts of questions.

  body: 'The sidebearings do have an effect on the result of ID optical kerning, Thomas.
    I tested this when ID first came out, by making a font that contained the same
    glyph with variant sidebearings. The optical kerning feature does not completely
    override the sidebearings but somehow seems to take them into account. If, for
    example, you have a letter with an abnormally huge left sidebearing, and the same
    letter shape with an anbormally narrow left sidebearing, ID will not equalise
    them; rather, it will adjust both but keep one looser and one tighter. Actually,
    this is very clever: much cleverer than simply overriding the metrics.'

  body: You&#39;re right that the sidebearings &#42;influence&#42; the spacing. What
    I should have said is that the optical kerning can have the effect of making the
    spacing overall tighter or looser, which is why I don&#39;t think it&#39;s practical
    to just take some of the optical kern values and use them as the kerning values
    in your font, unless you are also going to adjust the spacing to match the basic
    spacing established by the optical kerning. <BR> <BR>I hope that made sense. Anyway,
    I found out who the two people I need to talk to about it are, and just have to
    make time for a chat. <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'Thomas, I asked Eric about this back in Vancouver. He looked into it a little
    and sent me the following last October: <BR><blockquote>&#34;I looked at the code
    and it looks like the optical kerning algorithm looks at the native white space
    area between oo and OO to determine an optimal &#39;whiteness&#39; factor of the
    font as a whole. It then fits 2 characters together by trying to match in some
    way the white space area of the appropriately &#39;cased&#39; pair of O&#39;s.
    <BR>&#34;You could probably mess around with it by changing the default fit of
    the oo &amp; OO in a font.&#34;</blockquote> <BR>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s much

    rely on the positioning of the cursor when it&#39;s placed between two characters:

  body: 'I think you misunderstand me, Hrant. By &#39;adjusting&#39; I meant adjusting
    the inter-glyph space with kerning, not adjusting sidebearings. The &#39;good
    gap&#39; for a given pair of glyphs, as arrived at by the optical kerning feature,
    is determined by their sidebearings as well as by their form. If the optical kerning
    was based only on form, pairs of otherwise identical glyphs with variant spacing
    would end up kerned to be evenly spaced: they are not. In other words, InDesign&#39;s
    optical kerning to some degree relies on the font being decently spaced to begin
    with.'

  body: 'I&#39;ve been comparing InDesign&#39;s optical kerning to <i>my</i> optical
    kerning, i.e. to how I kern glyphs by eye in FontLab. Using lists of sample words
    in both FontLab and InDesign, I have been manually spacing pairs in FontLab and
    then comparing them to what InDesign&#39;s optical kern feature does. Some kinds
    of pairs are handled very well by InDesign, and the results are very close to
    what I do by eye; other kinds of pairs, especially in fonts with fairly long serifs,
    get pushed apart by InDesign and look too loose. However, what really caught my
    attention today was that InDesign does not kern consistently across different
    scripts, even if the glyphs and metrics are identical. <BR> <BR>The illustration
    below shows four pairs, using the Latin uppercase <i>T</i> &#40;U&#43;0054&#41;,
    the Latin lowercase <i>a</i> &#40;U&#43;0061&#41;, the Cyrillic uppercase <i>T</i>
    &#40;U&#43;0422&#41;, and the Cyrillic lowercase <i>a</i> &#40;U&#43;0430&#41;.
    In this font, as in most other biscript, Latin&#43;Cyrillic fonts &#40;ignoring
    for now my Hrant&#39;s perennial debate about whether this is a good thing&#41;,
    the Latin and Cyrillic <i>T/T</i> and <i>a/a</i> are perfect cognates: they are
    identical glyphs with identical sidebearings. As you can see, InDesign&#39;s optical
    kern feature applies different kerning depending whether the pair is Latin, Cyrillic
    or a mix of scripts. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/33609.gif"
    alt="ID opetical kerning"> <BR>This is disturbing, not least because it indicates
    another significant whole in our understanding of how the optical kern feature
    works. It also makes it impossible to predict how the optical kern feature will
    handle different scripts.'

    of different vertical metrics for the different scripts or something weird like
    that. <BR> <BR>By &#40;2&#41; I mean that the kerning has to decide what vertical
    extant &#40;&#43;/- in Y direction&#41; to take into consideration. I had assumed
    this would be font-specific, based on the Y-min and Y-max of the entire font.
    <BR> <BR>It had not occurred to me, but it&#39;s possible this could be specific
    to different subsections of the font, so as to ensure that the extremes of certain

    could affect the kerning of the scripts already in the font. <BR> <BR>Just a guess....

  body: 'Wow, a first: Thomas giving his company too <i>little</i> credit!  ;-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Actually, of course I can&#39;t know if the Indy boys were thinking what
    I&#39;m thinking &#40;admittedly it does seem like a big stretch - plus I can&#39;t
    explain the behavior in the mixed-script settings&#41;, but John, I keep warning
    you about this Modernist cognate fetish, and here I go again: <BR> <BR>The more
    I think about it &#40;especially after your recent posts on Typophile about what
    pairs of scripts have cognates&#41;, the more I&#39;m realizing that cognates
    might be nothing more than theoretical play. Like &#34;the Latin and Cyrillic
    T/T and a/a are perfect cognates&#34; falls apart when you consider the simple
    fact that the <i>rest</i> of those two alphabets have many non-cognates, and they
    combine &#40;think spacing&#41; with those cognates to actually convey language.
    A font is a little machine, remember? :-&#41; It&#39;s not a bunch of cognates
    and a bunch of non-cognates playing in opposite ends of the playground. <BR> <BR>In
    fact there IS a solid reason to make the Cyrillic &#34;Ta&#34; looser than in
    Latin: Cyrillic has proportionally more verticals compared to Latin. In effect
    this means that overall spacing needs to be looser, even among identical structures&#42;.
    When I was making Nour&amp;Patria it hit me very strongly: the Armenian &#34;vo&#34;
    and the Latin &#34;n&#34; have the same shape&#42;&#42;, but if you equalize their
    sidebearings and then propagate the sidebearing values to the other glyphs &#40;as
    you normally would&#41;, you end up with unbearably-tight Armenian setting. This
    is also manifest in the need to the make the sidebearings of round profiles in
    Latin tighter than control strings would indicate &#40;optionally subsequently
    loosening round-round pairs&#41; - because actual setting &#40;where verticals
    are more common than rounds&#41; benefits. <BR> <BR>&#42; And due to notan, a
    difference in the White must mean a difference in the Black. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;
    You might say that historically they&#39;re not cognates however, but really,
    the user comes before history. <BR> <BR>And John, one other thing: Indy&#39;s
    optical spacing is size-specific. So the only way to really evaluate it is to
    print out your test settings &#40;as opposed to looking onscreen&#41;. <BR> <BR>--
    <BR> <BR>Carter&#39;s spacing: although some geniuses <i>do</i> document their
    thoughts &#40;especially in a craft, versus Adam&#39;s musical example&#41;, it&#39;s
    probable that Carter might keep the overall strategy only in his head, but surely
    does also have lists and such for testing. <BR> <BR>I myself have two small &#40;and
    possibly stale&#41; anecdotal clues, which are however admittedly possible to
    read in very different ways: <BR> <BR>During TypeCon98, I was on a panel discussion
    &#40;I think besides the moderator -Brian Sooy- only one other panelist showed
    up&#41; about kerning, and as I was describing my own &#34;base&#34; strategy
    &#40;making two lists, one for right-profile exceptions and another for left-profile,
    then pairing up all the combos and kerning as needed&#41;, I noticed&#42; Carter
    nodding. &#40;BTW, I also noticed a guy in a PsyOps t-shirt massively furrowing
    his brows in confusion. :-&#41; Then when the moderator asked if there&#39;s anything
    &#34;special&#34; I wanted to say about kerning, I pointed out that the letter
    shapes themselves had to be open to consideration based on their potential spacing
    issues, citing the &#34;r&#34; as a particular problem-child, and I noticed Carter
    nodding again. That&#39;s all I have, Randy, sorry.  :-/ <BR> <BR>&#42; Through
