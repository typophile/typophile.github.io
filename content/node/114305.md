  body: Should be their own corporate font called [[http://www.basenow.net/2011/05/11/baselab-develops-adineue-typeface-for-adidas/|AdiNeue]]
    designed by BaseLab, somehow mixing [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic|Avant-Garde
    Gothic ITC]] (almost perfect for everything except /s) and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica|Helvetica
    Neue]] (mainly for /s here).
