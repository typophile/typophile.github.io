  on - it's a browser-based font editor.  Sound interesting?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI'm
  labeling it \"Beta 2\" because it still has a long way to go... but if you are into
  designing fonts, I'd love to hear any feedback you may have:\r\n\r\nGlyphr Studio\r\n<a

    so many parts -and so much extended concentration- to really end up as a usable
    thing I wonder if this could ever be useful for more than just sketching ideas
    - which means worrying only about letterforms, not a complete font.\r\n\r\n* And
    we had one like this earlier this year - can anybody find it?\r\n\r\nThat said,
    I do hope my hunch is wrong - best of luck with it!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "I actually agree - there are some huge omissions.  I think some of the
      things i'm going to work on next are kerning and hinting... but from a growth
      standpoint I do plan on continually adding features.  From a bottoms-up perspective,
      there are only so many aspects or features of a font, and those could translate
      1:1 to features in Glyphr.  But i'm also really interested in creating features
      that are useful to designers during the design process.  One example of this
      that made it into the current release is the concept of Seed Shapes... but the
      thing I like best about this project is that I can do whatever I want - there
      is potential to add any crazy feature I dream up :-)\r\n\r\nSo if you have any
      specific ideas about the current shortfalls - or font design tools in general
      - I'd love to hear them.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "You know, the one thing that's missing from any font editor (in fact any
    kind of vector drawing tool I know of) is what paper-and-pencil(-and-eraser :-)
    is great at: fuzziness, ambiguity. To me that's a natural part of making anything
    - which is why few people can make fonts entirely on the computer. It would be
    great to have an app[lication] that was naturally attuned to fleshing out ideas
    of shapes, not making final letterforms. For example instead of a curve being
    this totally crisp border between black and white what if it could be something
    with [controlled] ambiguity at any point?\r\n\r\nIf you concentrated on that instead
    of making actual complete fonts you might just see designers (and not just type
    designers) picking it up like hotcakes.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: Nice... "controlled ambiguity" - I like it.  You've planted an idea in my
      head.  Thanks!
