body: I've been a book designer in a large publishing house for about five years now.
  I recently started freelancing because of a move and took a lot of fonts with me
  from my previous projects I did in house. Lately I've been having problems with
  my fonts in that they are not complete sets, etc. I used to be able to look into
  a folder and see the font and screen font and know that I was okay. Now, I have
  no idea what I am looking at to know that I have a viable font. There are, for instance,
  in one folder, Font Suitcase, a lot of PostScript Type 1 outline fonts and a Unix
  Executable File. I have no idea what any of this means and if the font files will
  be okay for printing. Can any of you help to school me in what constitutes a good
  font folder? I'm so bewildered here. Sometimes, when a font goes wacky, a little
  (T1) will pop up in parenthesis by my font name in INDD. I work in InDesign 3 on
  a Mac. Thank you so much!

  body: If I were you I would delete all the files that you have not personally licensed.
    This will put you in good legal standing, and it will also allow you to start
    your own library of up-to-date fonts.

  body: I know that that is the right answer and I am trying to do that, but I seriously
    would have, like ten fonts left. I want to be there eventually, Jupiterboy, but
    need some basic help in the meantime.

    for the members and the knowledge they possess. I am looking for answers that
    will help me understand fonts better. Thank you.

    or the other way round). That will cause damage to the fontfiles that is very
    difficult and time-consuming to repair. \r\nGiven your situation you are better
    off to work with the fonts that are licensed with the software you\u2019ll (hopefully)
    use (Adobe apps, Corel). That will give you a nice start. Add to your library
    when circumstances and clients warrant this.\r\n\r\n(I did it this way over a

  body: Yes-I think I will need to invest in some fonts. I honestly did not think
    about it as taking in that way. I just took the designs I had created to showcase
    in my portfolio and the fonts came with. I didn't think I was doing anything wrong,
    but I can see that it does not sound good at all, especially to those that make
    their living doing this. Thanks for enlightening me.

    a custom font for a hardware product sent me a scan of an ad'' he''d spotted in
    an outdoors/mountaineering magazine, that seemed to be using the font. Sent mail
    to the company and it turned out that a designer had taken the fonts with him
    when he left an agency, forgot what they were associated with and used them in
    the ad. Red faces all round.    '

    EULA homework and see if someone on the inside can help generate some legal PDFs.

  body: I have heard some other horror stories about employees and students showing
    up with work in their portfolios using pirated fonts that the interviewers had
    actually designed and knew they were not legal licenses. Plus... you wouldn't
    want some someone to rip you off... it's hard not to have tons of fonts to play
    with, but lots of designers use one or three families and make it work! You can
    do it. And there are so many fonts priced so reasonably these days... and there
    are quite a few decent ones that are free... and your OS comes with some sweet
    little glyphs. Look deeper.

  body: haha..horror stories indeed. I think it's a test for the student to be able
    to use simple fonts and still make it look good. That said..sometimes you need
    something extra..and fonts aren't cheap:( sadly. I recently bought a font for
    a project that the client didn't use it in the end..(radical change) so yeah..I
    got burned pretty bad.
