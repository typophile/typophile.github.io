  body: Actually, it looks bolder than that. Is there a black weight, or perhaps it's
    modified?

  body: I'm looking for the Listerine font as well... However it seems like the font
    has either been modified or it's not ITC Avant Garde Gothic Bold. The "E" and
    "R" look distinguishably different. Funny thing though - when I switch to medium
    style the "R" looks ok at first glance - just of course it's not bold enough...
    They probably customized it? Any suggestions, guys? :-)

  body: "As a general observation, it's rare for big brand names to use stock typefaces/fonts,
    because they want to be distinctive. Once this custom work was drawn by hand,
    and now it's often done on a computer, but it has always been one of the main
    ways that type designers have made a living. Nowadays I get the impression that
    it's frequently the ONLY way that most designers can make any serious money, thanks
    to font piracy (which is one reason we frown so much on the 'where can I get it
    free?' question here).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
