  body: "That's someone else's questionably compressed rendering of the [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/84/Neiman_Marcus_logo.svg|actual,
    rather warmer logo]], which is almost 100% certainly hand-lettered.\r\n\r\nI've
    been looking for the squeezed (and rotated?) font in this rendering, and have
    so far drawn a blank, though I'm sure the fab people here will find it soon. :)

  body: "As Birdseeding rightly surmised, this poor typeface has been abused to make
    it resemble the original hand-drawn logo. It has been artificially compressed
    (horizontally) and straightened closer to vertical (by about 15 degrees, I\u2019d
    say).\r\n\r\nSnapper Script, by Art and Sign:\r\nhttp://artandsignstudio.com/snapper.html\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SnapperScript_4969.png]"
