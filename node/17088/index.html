  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m new to the forum, but look forward to participating in it.  I really like the design and way it functions - very different to other boards! :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask about books for novices.  I see it&rsquo;s been covered before, but some of the books I mention below (all found on Amazon.com) are relatively new.  Does anyone have any advice as to which of these books (or any others) one should or shouldn&rsquo;t go for?  I&rsquo;m open to getting more than one (though obviously not too many :)).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in type as it is used today - in advertising, book/magazine/document layout, digitally (on-screen documents, websites, etc.), as an art-form on it&rsquo;s own.  I&rsquo;m also interested in the history of type, but I&rsquo;m really looking for a book that offers practical advice on layout and type use.  I&rsquo;m very interested in design in general, so I&rsquo;m also open to books that cover type as a part/chapter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading &ldquo;The Rules of Typography&rdquo; and other articles on The Font Site (www. fontsite.com), so a book would similar advice would be nice (if that&rsquo;s recommended).</p>
<p>The books I&rsquo;ve found are:</p>
<p>Typography
by Friedrich Friedl</p>
<p>Typography Workbook: A Real-World Guide to Using Type in Graphic Design
by Timothy Samara</p>
<p>Typography: Macro- and Microaesthetics
by Willi Kunz</p>
<p>Type &amp; Typography
by Phil Baines and Andrew Haslam</p>
<p>Thinking with Type : A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, and Students (Design Briefs)
by Ellen Lupton</p>
<p>The Elements of Typographic Style
by Robert Bringhurst</p>
<p>The Complete Manual of Typography
by James Felici</p>
<p>Stop Stealing Sheep &amp; Find Out How Type Works, Second Edition
by Erik Spiekermann and E.M Ginger</p>
<p>Making and Breaking the Grid: A Graphic Design Layout Workshop
by Timothy Samara</p>
<p>A final note: all the books look interesting, but (a) it&rsquo;s difficult to judge them when you can&rsquo;t flip through them and see what they contain, and (b) I have no idea about the credibility of the authors.</p>
<p>Any advice would be most appreciated.  I apologise for the long post - particularly seeing as it&rsquo;s my first! :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em> by Robert Bringhurst really is one of the VERY BEST books you&rsquo;ll ever find on typography and design. It discusses basics, history, page layout, proper terminology, &ldquo;the rules&rdquo; of good typography and even has a meaty specimen section in the back. It should be required reading for all designers.</div>

Two books I can&rsquo;t live without - The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst (you mention this one) and Letters of Credit by Walter Tracy. Stop Stealing Sheep is very good, Type &amp; Typography is excellent. The Lupton books are always good. For history and examples the always popular can&rsquo;t live without it type of book, no pun intended, is Jaspert, Berry &amp; Johnson, Encyclopaedia of Type Faces, Blandford, 1993, I hope still in print. I also like About Face - Reviving the rules of typography by David Jury, RotoVision, 2002. Finally, not really, a great one, Language, Culture, Type edited by John Berry, published by ATYpI/Graphis, 2002, and Dutch Type by Jan Middendorp, 010 publishers, Rotterdam, 2004, pricey, but worth it. If I had to pick one from these, stranded on a desert island, it would be the Berry book. As long as I had a writing implement and a piece of parchment with me, and a tropical fruit or two.
Have fun
