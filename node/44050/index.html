  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi. I have designed four weights of a new font family that I would like to appear in font menus with easily recognizable names reflecting their weight. For example</p>
<p>1-MyFont Light,
2-Myfont Regular,
3-MyFont Semibold
4-Myfont Bold.</p>
<p>Where the listed numbers are to simplify the discussion here.</p>
<p>Font #3 should be the bold for font #1 in applications such as Word
Font # 4 should be the bold for #2 in applications such as Word
All four weights should be accessible independently in the various font menus of different programs.</p>
<p>I have tried various naming schemes as suggested in discussions here and in the Fontlab MSN forums with little success. The name MyFont Medium seems to be generated automatically instead of the &lsquo;Semibold&rsquo; for #3. Medium is an ambiguous term and it will not be clear to the user that it is heavier than &lsquo;Regular&rsquo;. I even tried installing extra differently-named versions of fonts #3 and #4 to appear as the independent bolds, but that conflicted with the already installed &lsquo;linked&rsquo; bolds. This occurred even when I replaced the word &lsquo;bold&rsquo; in the extra font with another word. I would really appreciate it if one of the kind type gurus here could help me solve this problem.</p>

<p>If you want to have the fonts linked as bold versions 1&gt;3 and 2&gt;4, then fonts 3 and 4 can NOT show up as separate fonts in typical Windows applications such as Word. Sad, but there it is. That&rsquo;s just how fonts work on Windows (at least in most Windows apps).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Thomas for the quick response. I never could understand that saying - what&rsquo;s the use of having the cake if one cannot eat it? :) OK I understand what you are saying.  Preferably the font would work on both PC and on Macs, and I could generate it either as OT or TTF whatever works best- both formats seem to work well.  I forgot to add another preference- that Word be prevented from generating its own &ldquo;fake bolds&rdquo;. 
Would it be too greedy of me to ask you to outline both scenarios (A) and (B)? Would it be the same for the Mac? This is my first digital font so your help is greatly appreciated.
Cheers

I must admit it had some information that was too specialized for me to understand fully, but the illustrated figures were very helpful. These covered linking pairs of fonts so I now need more information on listing the four weights as individual entries, particularly in Adobe applications.

<p>If you want to avoid fake bold in Word, the style-linked method is your only option. This would be scheme A in the PDF (page 5, left column).
Then, Word will show only Light and Regular in the font menu, while Semibold and Bold can be accessed via the Bold button. But you will see all four weights/styles in Adobe applications if you fill in &ldquo;OT Family Name&rdquo; and &ldquo;OT Style Name&rdquo; on the FontInfo&rsquo;s &ldquo;OpenType-specific font names&rdquo; page &ndash; the &ldquo;OT Family Name&rdquo; should be the same for all four weights.
Can you fill in the names and then post screenshots of the first two FontInfo pages, or send a link to a download of zip&rsquo;ed screenshots? I think it&rsquo;ll be easier to spot what went wrong.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Karsten and Thomas I learned a lot. After much trial and error and a generous dose of beginner&rsquo;s luck, I managed to name the four fonts so that they appear as four separate entries in both Word and in Adobe applications. Fake bolds are blocked in all cases.  I am happy with this result on my XP but doubtless there may be pitfalls in other situations so your feedback is welcome.  Refering to the letters in red in the figure (the one shown is for the bold) I compiled a table of the various entries and the result in Word and Adobe menus.</p>
<p>In each case after filling items A B C L M I clicked &ldquo;Build Style Name&rdquo; then the rest of the names can be built automatically using the two diamonds shown. The numbers in (A) give the stem width of the font, and the ones in (L) reflect the weight increase, but I am not sure of their significance or   how they must be derived.</p>
<p>I found that an important step to avoid errors is to go to the page &ldquo;Additional Open Type Names&rdquo; (not shown here) click the red X to delete any previous entries, then click the &ldquo;FI&rdquo; button to import names, then Apply/OK</p>

<p>The &ldquo;bold&rdquo; checked in (M) is to foil the awful bolds generated by Word on its own, but the PS Font Names in (E) will all be different.  (E)= (A)+(B)</p>
<p>One question remains - the family will not have the same name in (A) - will that have an effect on such issues as copyright or cataloguing or other aspects of font usage?</p>

<p>The best thing is to make some tests. Try all fonts in different applications (InDesign, Word, TextEdit, as well as older ones like Freehand), and print documents on different printers. In addition, check cross-platform compatibility. As an example scenario: Create a Win/Mac Word document with the fonts, save it, then import it to Win/Mac InDesign.</p>

<p>Exactly, but here there is no one family name because the numbers in each font name make (A) different each time.  I was not thinking too clearly when I asked about copyright - just wondering in general if the lack of a unified family name will cause any issues in marketing etc.</p>

<p>You were prescient about this - when I placed the Word document in InDesign, a fonts not found error message was given.  However the fonts automatically chosen for substitution where the correct ones.  This trouble is caused because of the double naming of a font as &ldquo;Regular&rdquo; and as &ldquo;Light/Regular/Semimold/Bold&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the way may I ask you to advise me about any special steps required to generate a font for the Mac?  Thanks again</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t like the suggestion of just ignoring the OpenType names. That will cause the Windows-style names where every font is a separate family to carry over into OpenType. I believe there&rsquo;s no good reason to punish savvy applications because of the limitations of typical Windows apps.

I suggested to ignore the &ldquo;Additional OpenType names&rdquo; page which shows the future name table&rsquo;s content. This because if one forgets to refresh it after adjusting other Font Info pages, and if &ldquo;Export only OpenType name records - &hellip;&rdquo; is selected in preferences/options, then former name strings will go into the name table rather than latest adjustments done in other Font Info pages.</div>

<p>Thomas&rsquo;s sentiment is understandable. I imagine it would be like a biology professor  having one his students invent their own taxonomy for the family, genus and species of some specimen brought to the lab.  On the other hand what could be more disturbing than the &ldquo;lie&rdquo; of having a user press the bold button in Word and seeing text appear with smudged ungainly outlines instead of the crisp ones painstakingly designed by the typographer?</p>

<p>Agreed. In the naming experiment above (using Karsten&rsquo;s useful workaround for the Mac name), when a Word file using the four separately-named fonts was placed in IndDesign the Adobe application refused to recognize the AlQuds 240 Bold. But it worked when I renamed it AlQuds 240 Black.  I am sure other problems might also occur in other situations.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best compromise is to have the fonts named as two families, Light and Normal, with a linked pair of fonts Regular/Bold in each family, named in the standard way. Pity, it was so nice seeing the four fonts listed by weight in the menus.</p>
<p>I console myself by thinking that users of Windows apps are less likely to be as font-conscious as those using Adobe apps. I mean that following this latest suggestion, Word displays only two font weights; the other two will only appear as &lsquo;true&rsquo; linked bolds.</p>

<p>I think so. It isn&rsquo;t even a compromise but gives Windows users the behavior they would expect.</p>

<p>Unfortunately couldn&rsquo;t help much &ndash; only remind to do many tests when trying unconventional solutions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, is the case-sensitivity merely a naming convention, or would applications actually make a distinction between myfont.ttf  and MYFONT.ttf ?  If the latter, that may be an interesting way to name regular and BOLD versions of a font. The font family I am working in will now have six weights and I must decide about naming soon.</div>
