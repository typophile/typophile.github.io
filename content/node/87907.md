  my good old Garage Fonts \"Basic Kerning \u0162ex\u0162\" file doesn't cut the cheese.\r\nThere
  is a whole bunch of eastern European glyphs missing.\r\nDoes any one have a kerning
  text file that comply with the Linotype Extended European Character set (LEEC)?\r\n\r\nOr
  any other tips?\r\n\r\nI'm working in Fontographer 5.1\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nHans
