  body: "The second version works nicely with the t and g but I think the first version
    would be more normal. I'd actually suggest making the left arm slightly slightly
    steeper and the join down slightly below the baseline I think.\r\n\r\nYou might
    need to thin the joins on the bowl and stick letters."

  body: I'd choose the middle one, It fit better with the rounded design of you typeface.
    Also the left oblique of the first and the third y should be on the baseline as
    the w is. It seems the weight of your typeface are unregular. Take a look at your
    w and the x the oblique are not the same thickness. Keep going.
