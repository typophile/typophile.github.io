  have seen, when fonts are used in @font-face, they can come out looking quite different
  on the various browsers and operating systems. As part of the [[http://typerendering.com|Type
  Rendering project]] (along with Tim of Nice Web Type, Ethan of Fonthead, and Zoltan),
  I want to figure this issue out. I want custom type on the web to succeed.\r\n\r\nAt
  this point we\u2019re ready to pin down and illustrate the aspects that contribute
  to poor rendering quality. But I need this community\u2019s help in one key part:
  We need to select appropriate typefaces to use as baselines.\r\n\r\nWe think we
  need three typefaces:\r\n1) A CFF OTF font, designed for the web, with hinting.\r\n2)
  A TTF font, designed as TrueType, designed for the web, with hinting.\r\n3) A more
  amateur font, maybe something random from Font Squirrel?\r\n\r\nIf we can acquire
  such typefaces, I, and the Type Rendering cadre, will put them through the paces
  \u2014 exploring how they render in all sorts of conditions. All our findings will
  be public, of course. We want everyone to win.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your suggestions.\r\n\r\nPaul"

    I know your job requires that you look at the big picture. And I know how daunting

    come an OTF that looks perfectly fine in FF - using standard Windows API's - can't
    even be converted to an EOT?And when you do convert the original OTF to TTF and
    create the EOT, it looks like crap?\r\n(One of the things I\"ll be exploring over
    the course of the next year is the remedial work needed to mitigate this problem.
    But really, it should be MSFT offering the solutions. Not type designers or web
    designers.)\r\nWhat does MSFT intend to do about in the short term?\r\nDo we need
    a Google plug-in for this? Or one from Mozilla, akin to the plug-in that enables
    the Canvas tag?\r\n\r\nOh, and BTW - Happy Holidays, Si.\r\n\r\n@paul\r\n\r\nIMHO
    - it's going to have more of an impact right now, to make a list of what you shouldn't
    do, rather than what you *should* do.\r\n\r\nIn other words, for the moment, avoid
    this, avoid that.\r\n\r\nAnd Happy and Healthy to you, too\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://readableweb.com\">rich</a>"

    To name one browser - Firefox 3.5 - there is no problem rendering an OTF CFF font
    (using standard Windows API's as I understand it, but I am not sure.)\r\nThe font
    I'm looking at right now is Galaxie Copernicus Medium from Village and it looks
    excellent from about 16px size on up. (Below that size, there are some issues.
    I wouldn't use it for body text. <strong>Avoid For Body Text</strong>)\r\nIt also
    might look just fine and dandy converted to a TTF, but I don't know if the EULA
    allows it and the last people in the world I want after me are The Village People.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as knowing what an OTF CFF font is going to look like in IE Next, well, I
    don't think it's a stretch to judge based on the WPF samples that John Hudson
    and Thomas Phinney are working with/on.\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/64451\r\n\r\nAlso,
    in IE Now (IE 6, 7, 8) it's certainly possible to see how crappy (or not) an OTF
    CFF looks simply by bypassing @font-face, installing the font in the OS, and viewing
    it from there - called from a typical CSS font stack.\r\n\r\nWe need to see the
    good, the bad, and the ugly.\r\n\r\nHave at it, guys.\r\n\r\nrich"

    By stroke width (amount of pixels/subpixels coloured) or by stroke density (darkness
    of pixels) or a combination of the two? On my system and screen combination, Apple's
    Quartz rendering is by far the heaviest in terms of stroke width but not in terms
    of stroke density; ClearType is heaviest in terms of stroke density but lightest
    in terms of stroke width. Adobe's Acrobat rendering has lighter stroke width than
    Apple but lighter stroke density than ClearType."

    forces. And try not to compound rendering and scaling into 'a problem', if possible.
    \r\n\r\nYes Thomas, we have done a lot of research. Here is some sharing; Minion
    Pro and Myriad Pro in OpenType CFF render pretty well down to 9 pixels per em,
    and just fabulously at 12 or more, sometimes. \r\n\r\nNo Rich, \"having at it\"

    I have no doubt it can teach us all and save the Type Rendering project time and
    effort. But I can also understand the competitive advantage in having expert knowledge
    about web type rendering.\r\n\r\nMaybe our effort will go far enough that more
    thorough, more expert researchers feel comfortable sharing\u2014perhaps to show
