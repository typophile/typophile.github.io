body: "Hi, I'm working on a project called typeface.js, which aims to do font rendering
  in the browser using javascript, &lt;canvas&gt;, and VML.  With that functionality,
  we can avoid having to use images or flash to display graphic text on the web.\r\n\r\nThe
  idea is that you should be able to take an open-source font that's free to redistribute,
  then convert that to a typeface.js font (basically the outline information and metadata
  in JSON format), and then use that font on your site just like normal, with plain
  HTML and CSS.  \r\n\r\nIt even works.  Here's the site for the project, and it uses
  its own library to draw its own graphic text:\r\n\r\n     http://typeface.neocracy.org\r\n\r\nThere
  are a few cool things about it, it seems to me.  One is that you get consistent
  rendering across platforms, whether you're talking about Windows or Mac or Linux,
  or whatever else, as long as there's <canvas> or VML.  \r\n\r\nAnother nice thing
  is that if you're willing to forego that consistency, once we have cross-browser
  support for @font-face (if that ever happens), all you'll need to do is substitute
  some @font-face rules for the call to load typeface.js and its fonts, and that should
  be all the change that's needed.\r\n\r\nAnyway, think this'll work?\r\n\r\n"

    labor savings are big advantages. For example, a newspaper site could have all
    headlines in its own custom headline face as soon as a story goes live with no
    need for a person to generate and/or check an image, and not incur the cost of
    readers downloading every single headline image. For a site like NYTimes.com or
    ESPN.com this could be a great way to reinforce a brand at little cost."

    to move this solution to a more \"embedded-like\" (EOT) option, which I prefer.
    That is why I am advocating for it to be domain/server specific. That is also
    why I wanted embedding permissions (!thankyou) to be respected. It would be nice
    to have a time machine, go back and create a permission for font linking, then
    journey back and ask David Chester to respect that. Or you could hope his users
