  font called Benjamin, but I cannot find a font match with any font of that name.
  The closest match I can find is Mustardo, but it is not a very close match. Has
  anyone got any ideas where I may locate this font. I attach a sample of the font
  below[img:sites/default/files/old-images/benjamin_3552.jpg]"
