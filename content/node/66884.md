  body: "<cite>This is not Grammarophile, folks! ;-)</cite>\r\n\r\nThe term \"grammar\"
    apparently derives from a Greek term meaning \"art of letters,\" whereas \"type\"
    comes from Greek <cite>impression</cite> or <cite>cast</cite>. Maybe \"Grammarphile\"
    would be a better name for this place, since so much talk of non-cast letters
    going on here : )\r\n\r\nThis thread, though, definitely belongs at in some kind
    of philology website. But would that be called \"philogyphile\", \"logyphile\",
    or simple \"philology\"?--since \"Philology\" itself means \"love of words.\""
