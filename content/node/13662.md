  [[St. Bride Printing Library]] is supported by an active group of Friends that represent
  the interests of the Library\u2019s users. The Friends are an independent body within
  the St Bride Foundation that help support, safeguard and promote the Library\u2019s
  activities and assist in the purchase of rare books and archives.\r\n\r\nThe Friends
  work hard to develop and maintain an interesting and varied programme of lectures,
  exhibitions and conferences. As well as being informative events that raise money
  for the Library, these gatherings are also excellent social occasions and an ideal
  way to meet fellow enthusiasts. The programmes are varied with exhibitions and lectures
  ranging from a celebration of the hottest artists from the Gig Art genre to displays
  of the inscriptional letterforms of early Christian Wales. But the highlight of
  the Friends\u2019 calendar is the [[St Brides|annual conference]]. This three-day
  conference attracts speakers, exhibitors, and delegates from around the world.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  can become a Friend of St Bride, regardless of age, background or interest. The
  current members include professionals and students, amateurs and the retired; some
  members are regular visitors, others have never been to St Bride Library. But all
  are united in wanting to show support and appreciation for the Library.\r\n\r\nhttp://stbride.org/friends"
