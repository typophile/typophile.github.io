body: "Just as many other people in this section of the forum I ask help from design
  experts. People! Please, HELP! I can\u2019t find this font anywhere and feel like
  I\u2019m going nuts!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_6427.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  font is usually used in all kind of monitoring LCD panels and in particular in this
  one:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adl-backlit_4544.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MoTeC
  SDL Boost blk_4559.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SDL_6056.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy
  the way, in the electronic <em><a href=\"http://www.motec.com/support/manuals/Manual%20ADL2%20A5.pdf\">PDF
  manual</a></em> from that LCD panel there are <em><a href=\"http://img165.imageshack.us/img165/6694/manualhd7.jpg\">illustrations
  of its front side</a></em> and in document properties of the manual is specified,
  that it has been created in Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows). From this I can draw
  a conclusion that the given font exists (I <strong>very</strong> much hope), and
  has been used during creation of that PDF manual. There are many similar fonts and
  I have them, but replacement is unacceptable. This part:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/x_3710.jpg]\r\n\r\nshould
  be by all means displaced to the left. I.e. it would be very desirable full similarity
  to the original!\r\n\r\nGuys, I really need it. Please, help me!"

  body: The PDF manual contains no font - the illustrations are all graphics - no
    embedded LCD font. I too have several LCD fonts but none with the rounded corners
    you need.
