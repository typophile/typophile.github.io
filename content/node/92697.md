    system icons (this is for XP - later versions should be similar)\r\nRight-click
    on an empty area of your desktop.\r\nSelect properties.\r\nClick the Desktop tab\r\nClick
    the Customize Desktop button.\r\nSelect the icon you want to change and click
    on the 'change icon' button.\r\n\r\nJust found the Windows 7  method. Very similar:\r\n[[http://www.marmalademoon.com/change-system-folder-icons-windows-7/]]\r\n"
