body: "I recently read Eric Gill's <em>An Essay on Typograhy</em> and found it quite
  interesting, especially since Gill connects his thoughts on typography and his craft
  with his whole philosophy on life. Though it is hard to agree with this man on everything,
  he has some interesting ideas to wrestle with, and it is interestng to read this
  work 80 years down the road from when he wrote it.\r\n\r\nSo that was a short recommendation
  for all of you who can't read my blogpost in Norwegian here:\r\n[[http://hansivarstordal.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/an-essay-on-typography-market-day-handverkets-d%c3%b8d/]]"
