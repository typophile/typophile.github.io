<p>[[http://brand.abudhabi.ae/Sites/OBAD/Navigation/EN/SupportingElements/Typography/primary-font,did=88374.html| Abu Dhabi&rsquo;s New Font]]</p>
<p>Most impressively, it manages to avoid the cheesy look <a href="http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=202&page=1" title="Other Arabic fonts">most Arabic-styled fonts</a> managed to trudge into and fits the brand rather well. I like the loops on the &lsquo;g&rsquo; and &lsquo;y,&rsquo; though I have to wonder what would happen if they tried to write any word that had a &lsquo;gy&rsquo; together, like &lsquo;clingy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I quite like the brand mark, though.</p>
<p>The choice of Nazanin as a companion Arab font is competent, but not inspired.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The brand strategy sounds good, but typeface? Trying to please English and Arabic reading audience seems short-sighted. Reading long paragraphs in that typeface will be a nightmare. Why not try and match a no-frills accepted Roman typeface with a contemporay Arabic typeface like many have succesfully done before.</p>
<p>We in India with its many languages have often tried to design a local-flavoured Roman typeface, rather unsuccessfully. Even at the cost of being called a pessimist, Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s verse &ldquo;The East is East and the West is West/ The twain shall never meet&rdquo; comes to my mind immediately.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It reminds me of the cheesy pseudo-Arabic letters that were on the <em>Arabian Nights</em>-themed Dungeons and Dragons supplements I had when I was in middle school. These letters would make a great swash set, but to get away from the cheese it needs a toned-down set of letters and some lighter weights.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is definitely not designed as a body typeface. Words like &ldquo;moment&rdquo; in their example become a bit laborious to read and as hashimpm says, reading long strings would be terrible, so I&rsquo;d imagine that they will be pairing it with a more legible typeface of some sort, but the site doesn&rsquo;t make that clear.</p>
<p>While I do agree that fonts should live in their own cultures (the pages I linked to on dafont seem to exemplify that), this one does seem to have some good qualities. Especially, as James points out, if it had some lighter options and maybe a bit less arabian nights feel (the extended connectors could definitely be shorter), it could be more elegantly presented.  Ultimately, the biggest issue I see with the font is that it precludes the ability for them to put both arabic and english versions on the same page. I like how, if you squint, the Abu Dhabi font presents a similar feel to the arabic one they&rsquo;ve paired it with, but it tends toward being too similar, to the detriment of legibility when combined.</p>
<p>The other thing I noticed was that the numerals on the font were stolen directly from Nazanin, which probably didn&rsquo;t help when weighting the english version. You don&rsquo;t usually see such direct &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m a bit surprised.</p>
