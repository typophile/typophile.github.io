  body: '&#42;Thank you all for helping! <BR> <BR>I just wanted to do something about
    the Communist theme, now I think it is so hard to find out what font was used
    in that picture. However, I have found another good font that would be good for
    me. Here you go <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48173.jpg"
