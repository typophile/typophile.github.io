  body: Conor that wouldn't be a pork pie now? Oh no it's sausage-shaped. Actually
    I think this is hand-drawn except the quote marks. It's like ITC Garamond Extra
    Bold on acid. Hideous. An extending crossbar like in the 'A' I haven't seen since
    Letraset Algerian, and it's not that one either.

      it was a hand-drawn attempt of another font. I\u2019m merely curious, as I\u2019m
      doing a re-design of their premium label.\r\n\r\nTa."

  body: "I think it looks more like a hand-drawn attempt to reproduce some sort of
    19th century Tuscan/Circus style, similar to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/quentin/\">Quentin</a>,
    or the sorts of fonts that Font Mesa specializes in.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
