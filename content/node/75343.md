  that pop up in lecture slides, others are part of small software packages that install
  about five times more fonts than they need and activate them all when they run.
  And now and then I reboot and find out that fonts supporting a few dozen languages
  I don\u2019t speak got activated even though I\u2019ve set them to not do so. \r\n\r\nIs
  there a font manager that can just shut off every font that isn\u2019t one of the
  few critical fonts I need to run MacOS? "
