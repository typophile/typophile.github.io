the slogan for the site will be "take a seat and play"

my favourite one so far is concept one featuring the table(green) and four seats (blue) but i'm not too sure about the font.. 
c&c would be appreciated..

Sorry this is negative but the name change has torpedoed the (in my opinion) stronger concepts.

>it’s a popular number in the UK since they’ve won their only football worldcup in 1966
Actually it is England’s (not UK's) only World Cup, and it seems a pretty tenuous link to me, even being a football fan for most of my life and reminded every four years that it is the only World Cup we have won I wouldn't draw that connection. Mind you, 1066 is another significant date in British history.

@tim
I agree with you that the connection between 66 and the name is far-fetched since it's not going to be a site about english footie.. but nevertheless they wanted the name so they'll have to live with it.. 

back to the topic.. I've created a new concept which fits pretty good imo.. you've got a strong bold font, a dynamic colour and the connection to table with the table top wich also emphasizes the skill aspect because you have to stay sharp and move on (with your skills) in order to win a lot of money.. what do you guys think?

		<div class="commentbody">My first impression is pool, snooker or billiards, which does fit into your definition of one aspect of skill games although maybe to the exclusion of others. I think you need to look more at the interaction of cue (green flash) and text, especially at the counters of the a & b and in the small size where the l becomes i, you might also want to look at increasing the weight of the numerals. The slogan could be a touch wider (larger) just to bring it to visual justification on table.

Also, I find the 'a' hard to read, and the 'l' sort of looks like a 't' with the triangle where it is. I still read it as "table" but it is a little hard to read.

@Zach: Don't you think emphasizing it on pool too much would take away the chance of other games such as backgammon and solitaire being connected with table66? I must admit though that I like the subtle indication of the blunted cue hitting the 6's more than the previous version with the sharp triangle going over the 6's

I just have to get the "l" right somehow..

I think it would be dangerous to emphasize the pool 'too' much, but I also feel like not emphasizing one game in a way thats immediately recognizeable might leave you with a logo that doesnt emphasize anything. Granted, it would be best to come up with some sort of symbol that would, to everyone, immediately say 'all skill games', but im not sure something like that exists. Something subtle like having the 66 on a pool ball (maybe without the cue in there) would at least have people looking at it and thinking pool and things like that. Once they saw the site they would know that there was so much more of course, but with the logo you want to have something that will draw people in. I think pool is a pretty universal skill game, so it would work well. I think darts might work well in that respect too.

Even if in the end you dont end up emphasizing it so much, looking at particular games will give you a good jumping off point.</div>

at b) and c) I've changed the size of the 6s and also the legibility of the a,b and e

at d) i've got the l standing out because of the hard legibility and the l becoming an i.. it's also used to as a finger to give the impression of holding a cue

		<div class="commentbody">Hm, I'm wondering: couldn't you extend the upper horizontal part of the t to form an arm/elbow? That's because I think a) looks best of all the options (and also because the b and l form the 'gate' you lie your queue on when playing pool), just that it creates the problem with the t - it seems to be standing out (towards the viewer) too much to still form a nice connected word. If you'd make the upper stroke of the t extend, it could fix that?!

Also, i think you should definately put in the extra 'end-stroke' for the queue like in the previous b) - it creates the nice image of someone really holding the queue.

take this with a grain of salt though, I'd still consider myself a noob ;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Another thought - maybe the cue would work better as an underline, so it won't get in the way of the letters. This might not be as dynamic, but it will help your legibility.

		<div class="commentbody">Having seen it without the cue I think you can slightly tighten up the ab, seems a bit pool-specific, but I suppose client's know their business (hah!), I also get the feeling that 66 can be better positioned in the circle (gnat's up and two or three gnat's to the right). For the black and white I almost want to see the type aligned with 66 but don't get that impression with the colour/larger one whether it's a question of scale or colour I can't work out.
