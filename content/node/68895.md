  Amtrak's PHL 30th St. Station. I suspect the typeface on the flaps is a custom job
  (presented as monospaced on single-character flaps, but kerned on longer place-name
  flaps), but I'm looking for something with a similar feel. So far the best I've
  got is Whitney Condensed Book or Medium; which will work fine, but I still wanted
  to see if there were any other opinions.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nMB"

    you want a monospaced font to replicate this sort of setting?"

  body: "It doesn't have to be monospaced, but narrower M's and W's help.\r\n\r\nFrutiger
    looks a lot rounder than this to me; even the condensed version. Myriad is even
    further in that direction. I'd really like to replicate the slightly cold industrial
    feel. Perhaps I'll have to settle on one of these and modify it slightly."
