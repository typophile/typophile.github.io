		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;The Linotype digitization of Electra will *not*, unfortunately, yield results anything like the original.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suppose my comment is relative to one's familiarity with Electra and one's pickiness. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I'm picky. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For education purposes, I have prepared a small comparison of the two versions. The first image is from the debut of Electra, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Emblems and Electra,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> published by Mergenthaler in 1935. At this stage, the face was completed in twelve point only and had not yet been graded (i.e., adapted and cut for other sizes). The second is a facsimile that I produced using the digital Electra LH, printed at 1200 dpi on toned paper to match the value of the Lino sample. Both were then scanned and the background normalized. My sample, although produced from a laser printer, is a fair representation of what the digital type looks like when printed in today's books. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Linotype metal <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Digital <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Certainly some of the difference in the overall color is due to the difference in printing technology. That is unavoidable. Even so, the digital Electra makes a very different texture on the page. It has a higher stroke contrast than the Lino and the fit is a little wider. Many of the letters are visibly wider in the digital version &ndash; look closely at the 'h, n, m.' Observe also that the 'o' and 'e' in the digital are noticeably rounder, the 'a' is more squat. The biggest difference in character shape occurs in the 't.' The original has a substantial tail which adds a great swing to the line, while the digital 't' is precariously balanced on a shy bottom.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The differences are, I admit, subtle. But on the page, they accrue to create a result which is, in my opinion, palpably different from the original. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I strongly suspect that the digital version was patterned after the 10 point Electra font. If so, this would explain the slightly wider character proportions and the looser fit. The original cutting, and by far the most useful size for books, was twelve point. (The samples are set 12 on 16.) I don't know why the 10 point would have been chosen as a model for the digitization of this quintessential book face. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The sentence in the middle of this sample reads, &quot;Make a line of letters so full of energy that it can't wait to get to the end of the measure.&quot; The original Electra does this admirably. The letters march in step and fuse wonderfully into rich word shapes. Take a look at a word like 'something' or 'what.' The digital, by comparison, falls a little short of the mark, in my opinion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My frame of reference is as a book designer. Electra was arguably the most popular and most widely used text face during the heyday of American book publishing in the 40s and 50s. While I would happily use Linotype Electra for just about every book (if only I could), I will not specify the digital version. It just doesn't do the job. I am always disappointed when I see it used in books today because it is such a pallid ghost of its predecessor. Perhaps if I wasn't so familiar with the original I wouldn't feel so strongly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; Kent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, thanks for that great comparison! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I never realized that the &quot;t&quot; (the second most frequent letter in English) really is very different. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But one thing that maybe you're not considering: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The fitting is looser in the digital, but you can see that both are fitted about right <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for their color<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So maybe the digitizers consciously chose to make it lighter (catering to [supposed] contemporary tastes? like Crawford* versus Mansfield), and realized -correctly- that it needs to be looser as a consequence?

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, it seems to me that the digital is fitted not just  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for the color, but also for the change in counters.

There are undoubtedly  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some who prefer the digital version to the original.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who can account for taste? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My primary point was that digital Electra is a thing unto  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->itself and not quite like the original &ndash; so those who see  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Electra being used in books from the 40s and 50s and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->observe that it is a &quot;killer font&quot; may be disappointed  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->when they license the digital font and attempt to get  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the same results. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That doesn't mean that the digital version is  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unjustifiable or that it shouldn't be used, necessarily.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I personally don't think it does Dwiggins's design  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->justice.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps someone from Linotype monitors these  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->forums.

There are inherent flaws in the casting process, and it undoubtedly drove men like WAD nuts to see jagged baselines, for example.

Granted, there are idiosyncracies and imperfections introduced by the machine and the process. But, first of all, this specimen was produced by Mergenthaler and, presumably, they would have produced their specimens to the highest possible standard &ndash; in the setting, at least, if not the printing impression.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Secondly, the alignment in the letterpress sample is not substantially different from progressive proofs that I have with Dwiggins's annotations on them. The dropped 't', for instance, and the extreme bottom overshoot of the 's' and 'w' &ndash; these are present in the proofs. There is even evidence of the 't' in some of the original 10x12 ink drawings. Surely if Dwiggins disapproved of these features, he could have had them recut and recast. The machining process was quite precise and the tolerances quite small. Instead, I maintain that, for better or for worse, these things were intended by the designer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Another thing that has occured to me. Did Linotype ever issue Electra as photofilm? If so, they probably made the digital from this.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This may be closer to the truth. According to the Linotype Library GmbH catalog, Electra was digitized in 1994. American Linotype was dissolved by then, I'm pretty sure; and while the assets went to Germany, the original drawings and brass patterns went to the Smithsonian (some materials have since been distributed elsewhere). I'm fairly certain that Electra was converted to photofilm, so it is quite possible that the digitizations were made from film masters. I can try to check up on this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;My feeling is that WAD might well have approved of the digital version that everyone is now convinced is a trevesty compared to the metal orig. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Obviously, I disagree. Don't get me wrong, I do not think that Dwiggins would have been adamant about mimicking the letterpress look &ndash; quite the opposite, he would have been interested in progress. And if he'd been involved in any conversion process, I don't doubt that he would have taken the opportunity to make improvements based on experience gained since his first text design. But from everything I've learned so far in my research about his process and his tastes &ndash; which types he approved of and which he didn't &ndash; I don't think he would have been satisfied by the letters produced by the current digital version. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; K. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Kent's revelation about Dwiggin's proofs shows that, contrary to Gerald, most of the variation was deliberately designed. I have a 1962 book set in Electra, and the 't' dipped below the baseline is there, although less pronounced than in Kent's sample. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also Gerald's view (if I understand it rightly) that you shouldn't take into account the ink spread of classics in doing revivals, I don't think holds up. If Dwiggins took it into account, why shouldn't someone digitizing Electra try to reproduce the effect of the printed version rather than the original matrices? It is also inconceivable to me that Caslon or Baskerville weren't also taking it into account. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The classic standard for beauty is &quot;unity, variety, and balance&quot;. It seems to me that the option of being incredibly precise with digital type &amp; photo offset printing may have tempted designers of text type to make the typeface too uniform. I suspect this affects not only beauty of words, but also readability.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding ink spread: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think it is poor design to try to slavishly mimic the precise <!-- raw HTML omitted -->effects<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of ink spread in digital revivals of metal type, because one has to reckon that some aspects of that spread are beyond the control of the original type designer or punchcutter, reflecting the particular ink composition, presssure, paper surface, etc. employed in a particular printing.
