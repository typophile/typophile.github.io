  the font used for CANADA (large typeface) on [[http://www.glasfurdandwalker.com/currency.jpg|this]]
  currency example. The letters are OK for Citation but the numbers are a bit ugly
  and I need something that works for both. Does anyone have any suggestions? Many
  thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    anyone. You're getting into shaky territory whenever you ask for currency typefaces.\r\n\r\n
