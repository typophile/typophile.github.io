body: "My friend is a professional writer who works with large amounts of text every
  day. Currently, she writes using monospaced Courier because, she says, it is clear
  on her screen and lacks flavour that would be distractive. She does not use any
  formatting either. She wants to focus on the content of her writing at the expense
  of everything else.\r\n\r\nMy question is - do you think there are better alternatives
  around for this kind of usage?"

  body: "She is on a Mac. But I am also interested for my sake (and I use Macs, PCs
    and UNIX machines interchangeably) as well as in general.\r\n\r\nShe also tried
    American Typewriter but did not like it because it was too fancy. This association
    with typewriter-like fonts seems alive and well in many areas. For example, screenplays
    also typically use Courier. I am not sure the association of bare-bones look with
    the typewriting past is a valid one but given the existing perceptions it seems
    to work. Still, a better alternative would be nice. Or perhaps, some reasons as
    to why Courier is indeed a good choice. One I can think of is that being ubiquitous
    and monospace it gives a fair estimate as for the length of a script. For script
    readers who have to go through piles of submissions it might be important.\r\n\r\nI
    tried to think of general criteria for choice but do not have enough experience.
    It seems to me that apart from no-frills appearance the writer\u2019s font should
    be easy to read in short or very long lines and in largish or very small sizes.
    It should print well too. I guess it should also be compact to maximize the screen-space
    utilisation? Not sure what else\u2026\u2026"

    both pretty serviceable. Certainly easy to read. \r\n\r\nDoesn't she find Courier
    a bit thin, a little hard on the eyes?"

    really needs is a good programmers' font. See here:\r\nhttp://blog.hamstu.com/2008/02/03/the-typography-of-code/\r\n\r\nand
    here:\r\nhttp://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000969.html\r\n\r\nMy personal
    choice for coding is Deja Vu Mono, a modified version of Bitstream Vera Sans with

    Unix systems, so I'll mention that I've found the \"Courier 10 Pitch\" included
    in many Linux distributions to be much easier on my eyes than the Courier of Windows.
    \ I've always found Courier in Windows to be much too thin for comfortable reading.\r\n\r\nST"
