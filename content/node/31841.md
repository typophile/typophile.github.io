  body: Yeah, I don't believe there is a special term for that type of 3...it's really
    just a design choice depending on the typeface. I don't think that they are unique
    to any particular class of type (serif, sans-serif, etc...)

  body: "I\u2019ve always thought of it as the \u201Cmiser\u201D 3.\r\n\r\nLong ago
    and far away (as the story goes), there was a merchant who had to travel a great
    deal. One night he stayed in an inn, and while the food was mediocre, there was
    a beautiful painting on the wall. When he got home and mused about the journey,
    he thought of that beautiful painting. \u201CWhy,\u201D he thought \u201CI\u2019d
    pay 70 colonmonetaries for it.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe decided to write the innkeeper
    and make an offer to buy the painting. As he wrote, he was halfway through writing
    the \u201C7\u201D (they wrote slower long ago & far away), he thought \u201Cmaybe
    he\u2019d take half that,\u201D so he changed the \u201C7\u201D into a \u201C3\u201D."
