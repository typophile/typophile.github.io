  now working on a website and logo design, and I really, really like that script
  typeface on the front of the business card, and I was hoping someone might be able
  to help me figure out what it is. The closest I've found is Filmotype Hamlet, and
  it's close, but not quite there. My research hasn't really gotten me anywhere :(\r\n\r\n(I
  figured it would be best to just post a link to the product page, since that way
  you can put in any text you want to see different letters.)\r\n\r\nThank you so
  much!"
