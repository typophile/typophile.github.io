  for it.\r\n\r\nI've pulled an element of the logo and need to find a font that matches
  it as closely as possible. I only have the letter V to work with, but if you have
  any suggestions, that would be awesome!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike"

    look because that is what your V reminds me of?\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra/|Mostra]]
    would probably work with it if I am right about the style.\r\n\r\nAlthough are
    you wanting a font that would work with your drawn V or do you want a font with
    a V like that?\r\n\r\n"

    it comes close as well.

  body: 'Could you clarify whether this is an upper or lower case ''v'' Mike. If it
    is indeed the latter you may well be looking for something very different to the
    typefaces that have already been suggested.  '
