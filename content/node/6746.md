  name: grey
body: Im making a scrolling display in the street outside my house.. In London, there
  are these glass brick that are often set in the pavement.. I have put a bunch of
  LEDs under the glass bricks and have started doing trcks with them.. but the grid
  of blocks is 4 high &#40;by 16&#41; so fonts are really tough.. <BR>Does anyone
  know of a resource where i can see the most efficient way of making fonts with only
  four pixels high...? I supose I could turn the thing around and do 16 high &#40;by
  4&#41; but you would have to turn your head... Someone told me Wim Krause made one
  up at the beginning of computer time.. Any help would be greatfully received.. <BR>P.S
  Check out the giant 3d sculpture I just made if youre interested.. <a href="http://www.greyworld.org"

    modifying the characters as you see fit. <BR> <BR> - Lex <BR> <BR>P.S. - Nice
