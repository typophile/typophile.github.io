  They're already sold on the current form--we just keep going back and forth on the
  angle of the \"M\" curve and the weight of the strokes...\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n-Aaron"

  body: I like it, but the alignment is weird. I understand that you're following
    the slant of the box, but it looks like "College of Music" is dangling into nowhere.

  body: "To me, it's way too recognizable as an upper case M and there isn't enough
    play going on with the shapes it forms. Try making the M bigger so the serif on
    the top left divides the orange square again maybe?\r\n\r\nI'd tighten up the
    distance between McNally Smith and The College For Music too."

  body: "It looks quite appealing, but uneasily unstable to me. The second line of
    text (\"the College for Music\") \u2013 possibly also because it is so very dark
    compared to the rest \u2013 seems to be pushing against the orange box. If it
    keeps pushing, the box will fall down on the whole text. If it doesn't, the box
    will probably fall over to the other side.\r\nDid you aim for this kind of tension?"

  body: I wanted the square to have tension and motion without turning into a diamond,
    but I definitely don't want it to feel unstable... Hmm.
