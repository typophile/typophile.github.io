body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Overshoot</strong>\r\n\r\nApplied to
  round characters and curved or rounded parts of characters which \"over-shoot\"
  a desired boundaries---typically the [[baseline]] and [[x-line]]--to compensate
  for the optical illusion of the curves under-shooting those boundaries. Most [[O]]s
  and lowercase bowl letters have an amount of overshoot in proportion to the plot
  of their curve. Tight curves require more overshoot than flattened and squared curves.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussions:</strong>\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/45312|per-glyph
