  \ \r\nI want to find a font for the title screen, as seen here:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/_Neon+Genesis+Evangelion_+title+logo[1]_5707.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  know there was a post about this back in 2004:  http://typophile.com/node/8045 \r\nUnfortunately,
  every link there is dead.  \r\nYes, every single last one.\r\n\r\nI was wondering
  if someone could identify the fonts for both the Japanese and English text.\r\n\r\nA
  big help would be appreciated."
