  body: "The headline font is very similar to Base 9, but the numerals don't match:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/base-9-and-12/\r\n\r\nThe
    subheads are a bit too small to ID definitively, but my first thought was Bureau
    Grot:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/bureau-grot/\r\n\r\nSadly, it
    has a bit too much personality to match your sample--it has the rounded over r,
    but overdoes some of the other details (the j is too curly, for instance).\r\n\r\nClose,
    but no cigar. I'll keep searching."

  body: "Supria Sans is close for the subheads as well, but the k isn't a match:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/supria-sans/\r\n\r\nFound
    the designer of the poster here:\r\nhttp://www.calaisek.com/\r\n\r\nAnd one of
    the other samples in the portfolio is a sample book for Base 9 and 12, so I think
    I nailed the title font (except for the numerals).\r\n\r\n2011 looks an awful
    lot like Griffith Gothic (with a bit of manual condensing):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/griffith-gothic/"

  body: "Okay, pretty sure the subhead is Monotype Grotesque Std Extra Condensed:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/grotesque-mt/std-extra-condensed/\r\n\r\nThe
    portfolio referenced above has a detailed view of Jonathan Barnbrook's name, and
    it's a good match."
