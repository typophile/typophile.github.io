body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI'm having trouble getting my latest font to work properly.  It's
  a script font with various stylistic alternates, contextual alternates, swash etc.
  etc.  My probelm is that for, say, ss01 to work properly, calt needs to be before
  it in the features list, but then there is a lookup in calt which doesn't work properly
  with ss01 unless ss01 comes first in the features list.  I've confused myself with
  that sentence so I'll try showing the problem with the code:\r\n\r\nfeature calt
  {\r\n  sub @ovw @changeafterovw' by @afterovw;\r\n  sub @changetbeforetall' @tall
  by @tbeforetall;\r\n  sub @tbeforei i' by dotlessi;\r\n  ignore sub @connectionafter
  o';\r\n  sub o' by o.init;  \r\n} calt;\r\n\r\nfeature ss01 {\r\n  sub @droopable'
  by @drooped;\r\n} ss01;\r\n\r\n<cite>sub @ovw @changeafterovw' by @afterovw;</cite>\r\nMy
  class names are probably a bit confusing, but the general idea is that letters following
  a letter with a high lead in change to an alternate form:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/look_3747.JPG]\r\nSee
  second o and k have changed form.  This is all good and works fine.\r\n\r\n<cite>sub
  @changetbeforetall' @tall by @tbeforetall;</cite>\r\nis a lookup that changes |t|
  and ligatures ending in |t| and alternate forms of |t| to versions with a shorter
  crossbar should there not be enough room for it - ie. when followed by a tall letter
  @tall.  The i doesn't count as a tall letter because it just changes to a dotless
  i:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tttt_5957.JPG]\r\n\r\nNow the ss01 is
  a stylistic set where droopable letters droop:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ttdroop_5867.JPG]\r\nand
  you can see that |t| is a droopable letter.  When calt appears before ss01 in the
  features list, the image above is the outcome, but when ss01 comes first, the |t|
  before a tall letter automatically droops because it hasn't been told yet that it
  should shorten its crossbar for the tall letter.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't a problem as
  I just put calt first and everything was working ok, but then I added an initial
  form of |o| to be used when there is no lead in - ie. after spaces, some capital
  letters, drooped forms of regular letters.  To do this I put all the letters with
  a connector to the right in one class, and got |o| to sub for |o.init| in every
  situation apart from when it follows a connector.  Problem is because calt comes
  first in the features list, |o| seems to think that drooped and swash letters before
  it are their original forms (ie with connectors) and isn't substituting for the
  initial form:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oinit_5302.JPG]\r\n\r\nIs there
  a way round this?  I'm guessing it's something to do with lookups but I'm not very
  good with those.  Any help would be very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDave"

  body: "Hmmm, I've just found a way to sort it.  I just put the \r\n<cite>ignore
    sub @connectionafter o';\r\n sub o' by o.init;</cite>\r\nin the stylistic sets
    and swash features too after the rest.  It works but it seems a very messy way
    of doing it.  Anyone got any better ideas?"
