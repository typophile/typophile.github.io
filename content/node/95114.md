    that Apple Technical Support would be included. Without a phone tree to get through.
    In order to get to a real human being. Whose first language was English. Above
    a third-grade level.\r\n\r\nWow: you must be feeling the way a lot of Apple shareholders
    are feeling right about now. You guys both think: Cool is cool, but where are
    the dividends? IMHO."

    the Library directories have been hidden by default) then use the Finder\u2019s
    \u201CGo To Folder\u2026\u201D command. After that all you have to do is move
    files around. It\u2019s no more complicated than that, really."
