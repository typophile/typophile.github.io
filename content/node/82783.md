body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nBelow are a few samples of the font family that I am working
  on right now: Klarendal Sans, named after the neighbourhood in which I live.\r\n\r\nKlarendal
  Sans is based on a typeface that I finished about a decade ago - FF Roice - which
  in turn was based on a typeface I made almost a decade before that, FF Engine.\r\n\r\nYou
  could say that I am addicted to rounded monoline typefaces and Klarendal Sans is
  no exception. I love the barebone clarity of having no contrast and it allows me
  to focus entirely on the baseform of characters - the skeleton - which seems to
  fascinate me to no end.\r\n\r\nWhen I first made Engine I faced some challenges.\r\n\r\nFirst,
  I wanted to make a textface without the hallmark feature of all typefaces and especially
  textfaces: contrast. Contrast allows for the balancing of the whites and blacks
  of a character wherever needed, to produce a nice and even fabric of text on a page.
  So contrast is good. But still, I wanted no contrast, not even low contrast like
  let\u2019s say Futura. I wanted nothing, zero, nada. \r\n\r\nSecond, I was a type
  lover but definitely no type designer.\r\n\r\nThird, I like unconventional stuff,
  which in general doesn\u2019t go well with reading, which as some of you may know,
  is based on rather a lot of convention ;-)\r\n\r\nLong story short, I did it, but
  it was clearly the quirky work of a hard working novice (though it actually reads
  quite well). So then I decided to make Roice, which was still quirky but much better
  proportioned.\r\n\r\nAnd now here\u2019s Klarendal Sans, well almost. It\u2019s
  like Roice, but without the quirks, and sans the serif-like bulges. Proportioning
  is also a bit different and ascenders and descenders are very short. And finally,
  the light and black weight are farther apart in weight but closer together in size.\r\n\r\nWith
  Klarendal Sans again being a monoline I still have to deal with the fact that black/white
  balancing has to come from the baseform and not from contrast, which becomes more
  and more problematic as weight increases, and I have to admit it: it still can\u2019t
  be done without cheating. Where necessary I reduced the weight of entire glyphs
  or increased the size of the counters, or both, while trying to maintain the monoline
  feel.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m still fiddling with weightcorrections and spacing, but so
  far I find the result quite okay. I wonder what all you type afficionados think
  of it, being what it is, a still fairly unconventional solution to a still very
  conventional task: reading.\r\n\r\nThanks, Alex\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/klsr_4252.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/klsb_4090.png]"

  body: "Alex, I'm a fan of Engine and Roice. They aren't exactly versatile typefaces,
    but once in a while there is a need for a simple, informal thing that doesn't
    have any direct connotations and they fit perfectly. This happened a couple of
    years ago when Marian Bantjes asked me for that very thing. She was designing
    a spread for \u201C<a href=\"http://www.bantjes.com/i-wonder/about-book\">I Wonder</a>\u201D
    and I recommended FF Roice. \u201CPerfect\u201D, she said.\r\n\r\nNaturally there
    is value in a Roice with fewer quirks, as long as you don't get too typographic/straight-laced
    with it. I think you're on the right path. I think the Black is problematic. Maybe
    stop one weight short of that one."

  body: "Thanks Stephen, it\u2019s nice to hear kind words about Roice and Engine.
    And thanks for the recommendation to Marian, great stuff.\r\n\r\nThe black is
    indeed a bit problematic, at least for text use, but I think I will keep it anyway
    but just for display use. Maybe I should call it Display in stead of Black.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    still trying to make up my mind about whether or not I like the sometimes notable
    weight differences in the black version. On the one hand i wished they wern\u2019t
    there but on the other I like them for the simple reason that they are functional
    and idiosyncratic.\r\n\r\nAlex"

  body: "These do work well small.\r\n\r\nThe letters you appear to have lightened
    for overall balance are in some cases lightened too much I think (the /a/ and
    particularly the /g/). Maybe widen the upper bowl of /g/?\r\n\r\nThe tittles seem
    awfully high relative to the ascender height. I'm not sure that tiny stroke shape
    is better than the circle I expected to find.\r\n\r\nI don't quite get the intended
    structure of the /e/--I feel like it straightens out and gets curvier as it goes
    around without clear logic. \r\n\r\nThe /t/ needs a higher stroke above the crossbar
    in the Black, I think.\r\n\r\nFWIW the name Klarendal makes me half expect some
    relationship to Clarendon fonts..."

  body: "I like it but I'd be concerned about different letter pairings.\r\n/\r\nFor
    example, the word \"Black\" in the regular weight creates an issue where the /l/
    and the /a/ look too light next to the /c/ and the /k/; same with the /n/ next
    to the /x/ (although, in the word \"heading\", the /n/ looks fine\". Also, the
    crossbar of the /t/ when infront of the /a/ looks too light.\r\n\r\nMaybe including
    a single story /g/ as an alternate would help too.\r\n\r\nEither way, please take
    my critiques lightly as I could just as easily be completely wrong and you are
    clearly much better at this than myself."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback, much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe general problem with
    the lightening of the glyphs is that there is not one treatment that will work
    for both small and large sizes. If some glyphs look too light at large size they
    may still be too heavy at small size. I should therefore probably make a choice
    and go for large and not try too hard to make the black work at small size.\r\n\r\n@eliason:
    As to the baseform of the glyphs: there is no logic in them other than my own
    liking, and my likings are not very logical at all. Traditionally there are lots
    of varieties of each character but they all belong to certain style classes and
    these classes are generally not supposed to be mixed up. So very often it\u2019s
    like: if the a looks like this then the e has to look that and the g like that.
    Or if you use that p you shouldn\u2019t use that f. As devious as I am, I sometimes
    like to challenge these systems and go by curiosity rather than rule ;-)\r\n\r\nI
    agree that the black t needs a slightly larger top and I will look into the high
    tittles too, although until now I thought they gave a nice lively feel. The single
    storey a and g are present already! Just not in these samples. Attached another
    one.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/samp_6114.png]"

  body: The 'e' stands out as being too light here. Diagonals and horizontals also
    appear heavier than curves. I guess that's the drawback of the strict monolinear
    construction, but it's a bit of a distraction.
