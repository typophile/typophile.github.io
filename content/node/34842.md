  body: "I don\u2019t generally like figures in the top style although these are rather
    attractive, however, the foreground figure does seem to be waving a thong at a
    broad-chested man wearing a bra (maybe an adult form of morris dancing that I\u2019m
    unaware of). The positioning and colour of the cyrillic seems to subjugate it
    while partially obscuring the latin, perhaps this is the english language version
    though. I suspect with the second you will have trouble in print with the gradations,
    especially where the magenta gets thin towards the bottom.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: I like the second one more... The squared pattern resembles handkerchiefs...
    Very nice. I don't like the between the line connections. Date is definitely not
    visible enough.

  body: 'I like the typographic treatment more in the second. Normally I don''t go
    for figures, but I like the people in #1. My final choice is #2 though. I agree
    with litera, date needs to be more prominent.'
