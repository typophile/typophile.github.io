<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Background:
This is a series of logos that I designed for a re-branding project done with a copywriter and art director. The concept, as well as the language of the copy, is geared towards the medieval period in the sense that the Kong toy acted as a "dragon slayer" in relation to the dog. It keeps your dog at bay, and from "pillaging" the place. We wanted to keep it fun and playful while speaking to this idea.
The Kong type is from scratch. I would appreciate some suggestions and feedback!
Thanks,
Joseph</div>

<div class=commentbody>Even though I really like the dogs posing as medieval dragons or lions icons common on dark-ages-retaled design, my favorite is #2. I think it will be more flexible and easier to integrate within the company's visual identity.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the reply, fernandoLins. I guess I forgot to mention why there is more than one logo shown. This is a series, which would all be used. The top logo, with the dogs, would be used on the packaging. The dogs could be switched out with cats, or birds, etc. The middle is the main logo which could be used anywhere, such as banners, etc. The bottom logo would be used on advertisements, and could be shown hung from a pole, either coming out from the bottom or the side of the ads -- much like they would appear in a battle scene or such, in those days.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'd have to vote for the second one as well. Due to the expression on the dog's faces & the tongues it just looks like they're humping the logo in the first. The third might be just a little cluttered for use as a logo.</div>

<div class=commentbody>These are great! Fresh and distinctive, yet still sufficiently compatible with the earlier branding that it won't be jarring to the consumer. (Yes, I'm a fan of the products). Far too often I've seen package redesigns that don't take customer familiarity into account, to the point I had trouble recognizing a product as the same thing, even when the name remained the same. Here you have preserved the bold red letters of the original Kong logo and done something new with it, but not so much as to destroy famiiarity. Good job!
But I would reconsider the rampant hounds astride the edges of the shield. It does look like they're enjoying it in a manner unworthy of a chew toy.</div>

Are they rebranding the entire Kong series? </div>
