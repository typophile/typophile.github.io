body: I was working on a project for my typography class and wanted to use a medicine
  for the project. I can't seem to find any known typeface that goes with any medicine
  on the market right now. I was really wanting to do Nexium. Does anyone know if
  this drug was custom designed or if it has a common typeface that can be downloaded,
  or bought? I'm new in the type world, so go easy on me.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/footer_nexium_pill_5004.gif]

    | Rotis SemiSerif]]\r\n\r\nThe tittle (dot) on the 'i' has been taken off.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

    that everybody knows but I can't name right now for some reason, with little semi
    serifs stuck on.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nexium_6570.jpg]"
