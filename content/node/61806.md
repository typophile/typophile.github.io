  out there somewhere\u2026\r\n\r\nAs part of the redesign/update of the NFL logo
  before the start of the last season,  the league also implemented (I think) the
  same typeface in all of their branding for sub-logos, website, etc. etc\u2026\r\n\r\nI
  believe it's a proprietary font, but does anyone out there know this one? Also,
  sorry if this is a repeat question on the forum.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
