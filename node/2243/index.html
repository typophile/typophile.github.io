  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Calling all typophiles: <BR> <BR>My agency, Pangea design, are about to design <i>Berling nova antiqua</i>. <BR> <BR>All contracts have been signed with proper authorities, and we have the blessing of Geith Forsberg, the widow of Karl-Erik Forsberg, the designer of Berling. <BR> <BR>As familiar with most of you, some of the typefaces made in metal have through the years and through technique or lack thereof, moved from dynamic useful typefaces to either dull, anorectic or plain bad interpretations.  <BR> <BR>This is not the case with the present Linotype version, which we think is good. It is not, however, complete. <BR> <BR>Our goal is to design a new book version and a new display version. It will include both going back to the sources <i>and</i> making the on-screen appearence good.  <BR> <BR>We've been given access to Linotypes sketches, friskets, letraset letters, photo setting versions, early sketches by Forsberg (unfortunately the original sketches given to the type punchers have vanished), new found and unused metal types have been printed in various sizes for us to use. The typographic guild in Stockholm have been briefed for feedback too. <BR> <BR>I would like to know what you think about this project, in general, and more specific, what would you like a new Berling to perform, something the current versions, unauthorized or not, don't? <BR> <BR>Which Berling do you prefer? The Linotype, Adobe, Scangraphic, Bitstream, megafonts or maybe some other version? <BR> <BR>For <i>what</i> do you use it? <BR> <BR>I believe the amount of knowledge on this site could give the project a definite good boost, and if there's interest I could keep you updated.  <BR> <BR>Yours, <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sounds like a great project. I love some things about Berling (like the short descenders) but also see some anachronisms. It's notable that Bill Hill chose Berling as the native font of the MS Reader software when that was lauched, probably for a combination of reasons, including its performance in ClearType as well as its high readability for book work. I also like that the Bold isn't too dark (at least in the Lino version). The two things I don't like are: <BR>1) The head serifs seem very affected. <BR>2) The caps are a bit large. <BR> <BR>Also, since the x-height is nice and small you might consider giving it hybrid numerals. <BR> <BR>Lastly, if you really want to get heavy, you should give it two italics: a rigid one of moderate incline and Roman features, and a cursive one that's steeper. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, the caps are <i>really</i> large, <BR>but I've noticed that the metal version's caps are proportionally way lower in smaller sizes.  <BR>I'll try and upload some comparisions early next week. <BR> <BR>Let me get back on some your other points later as well. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR></div>
