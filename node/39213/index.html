  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Though I generally shy away from any article that involve phrases like "<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/70983">Reinventing the Book</a>", I’m still mighty curious about Amazon's font selection for its Monday-launched e-book device, Kindle. I mean, for starters, out of all typeface in the world, why <a href="http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2007/11/18/amazon-kindle-ebook.html">Caecilia</a>?

<p>However, I think that Amazon might have gotten it right this time, because the device was:
<ul>
<li>Birthed with a culturally-centered principles, and</li>
<li>Built by sociologists and ethnographers</li>
</ul>
As quoted from the article:
<blockquote>...he [Jeff Bezos] ticks off a number of attributes that a book-reading device...must have. First, it must project an aura of bookishness; it should be less of a whizzy gizmo than an austere vessel of culture.</blockquote>

<p>Compare this with <a href="http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/">Sony Reader's</a>:
<ul>
<li>Feature and benefit-centered principle, and</li>
<li>Clunky reading interface that attempted to mirror exactly the appearance of a physical book or a PDF file (that looked like it was designed by a programmer instead of a sociologist). Look, dudes, with every new medium must come a new presentation model that is specifically suited to that medium, even if the contents themselves are old and dusty.</li>
</ul>
As quoted from their website copy:
<blockquote>The Sony® Reader provides a new way to experience reading. It boasts an impressive display, utilizing breakthrough technology that’s almost paper-like. In addition, the text can be magnified for sight-impaired readers. Daylight readable, high contrast, high resolution, near 180º viewing angle.</blockquote>

I think that if any revolution is to take place, it has to take the human spirit into account. From what I’ve read so far, Amazon seemed to do just that; but it remains to be seen whether those words were true to principle or just extremely empathic/clever PR.

Your thoughts?

The biggest problem with the type on Kindle is that paragraphs are full-justified and the layouts are not designed, just plain text.</div>

For reading on the bus/by the fire, I think you'll see paper for a LONG time to come, but there are definitely areas where not wasting trees and having a large access to a lot of texts will be useful.

That said, the whole DRM aspect of Amazon's product is absurd.

Which is incredibly ironic given that they've done such a great job with their DRM-free MP3 service.</div>

I have to disagree, but not entirely. When I want quick, up-to-date documentation I don’t want to mess around with an ebook, I want something like the Adobe help system. Sifting through a PDF or ebook is better than paper, but having it all cross-linked and organized hierarchically in a help app is much more efficient.</div>

Well, help != documentation/manuals IMHO. They are both useful, but both different.

Granted, both should be able to co-exist on an eBook reader.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">With all these talks, then, why would you ever want to read on an ebook device over a regular book? I’m mighty curious, because our community is pretty steeped in tradition.

For me, it’s a question of habit. I’m used to reading one storybook at one time before finishing it and moving on to another book. Had I have a habit of reading, say, 3 novels at a time, or doing a comparative study of some sorts, then I might use Kindle to save some space on my bag. That’s the only reason for using that I can think of.

Again, the question of the day is “why would you ever want to read on an ebook device over a regular book?” I’d love to know all of your opinions.

I also think that if a multifunction device like Kindle is to succeed, it’s got to offer something more than just <em>convenience.</em> <a href="http://linkenfuego.wordpress.com/2007/06/28/i-have-now-just-realized-that-the-web-development-software-coda-is-equal-to-iphone-in-spirit/">After the iPod, everything also has to be <em>elegant.</em></a> And I’m not just talking about it in the physical sense, but also in the user interaction and mental sense.

<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=BKUKQ7QqOHw">Watching its instructional video</a> almost made me wish for an iPhone-like interface. Everyone in <a href="http://typophile.com/node/39250">lazyeye88’s post</a> would agree, no ;^) ?</div>

- you are a freelancer and need to go to other countries for 1 week, 1 month, 5 month, where you wont be able to get books in a language you understand. though, you dont want to carry 20 kg of books with you.

- you travel very often and you dont want to carry heavy and big books or magazines with you.

- you enjoy to read magazines but you always throw them away after use, and you dont want to hurt the forests too much.

- you own 2000 books and suddenly you decide to go and live in another country for 3 or 4 years, then going back. its not worth the cargo shipping, but you miss your books.

- you are a kid going to school and you are tired of the 15kg bags which destroy your back.

- you are in starbucks coffee and you wish to read a nice book, novel or magazine, right here, right now. if the ebook reader has wifi, it'd be great to download articles on the go.
