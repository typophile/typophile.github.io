body: I have ordered wedding invitations for my daughter and am trying to match the
  script font to print names on the envelopes.  It is font T-473.  For my other daughters'
  weddings, when I called William Arthur they told me the font names.  Now since they
  have been purchased by Crane, they told me that they cannot give out the information,
  and I cannot find a matching font anywhere.  If it does turn out to be a proprietary
  font (which I was told that William Arthur does not use), can anyone suggest a similar
  one -- perhaps not quite as embellished?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T-473
