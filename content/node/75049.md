  ok to use them or is it smarter to try and avoid them as much as possible...reason
  why I'm asking is that I'm trying something out with drop caps but no mater how
  much i experiment with it it never looks quite alright.\r\n\r\nSo is it like a no-no
  when it comes to good typography?\r\n\r\nAlso are there like some unwritten rules
  for the kerning between the drop cap and the letters that follow...\r\n\r\nAlso
  do you actually use the spacing function or kerning function in Indesign when trying
  to make your drop cap float nicely with the text. \r\n\r\nCould someone maybe provide
  some examples/links on the web with good use of drop caps, that would be really
  useful to see how it should be done.\r\n\r\nthnx for the help everyone!"

    That being said, if they're not working for you, it may be that they are out of
    place in that particular piece. It would be helpful/interesting to see the context
    in which they are not working for you, including the typefaces.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Here's something that I always wondered.\r\nIt seems, from their inception
    and until rather recently, drop caps almost invariably followed this convention:
    When a drop cap began a word, the first line moved closer then all subsequent
    ones. Bottom Picture. Was the practice abandoned or deemed impractical at some
    point, as most modern examples I see treat the lines uniformly. Top picture.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dropcap_5774.png]"
