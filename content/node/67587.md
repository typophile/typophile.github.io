  And I spend some time on the Stone Type Foundry website, and I'm quite interested
  in Magma. Can you tell me what you think of Magma? I think it is very hard to judge
  from the screen, because of the fine details and tapered strokes. It reminds me
  a bit of Optima. I have one book set in Optima, which is alright, not great though.
  How do you rate Magma as a book typeface (an unusual one). And do you think it would
  make a good combination with cycles, when used on the same page together?\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
  do you know other sans-serifs that would go well with Cycles?\r\n\r\nTHX Jeffrey"

  body: "I find Magma an excellent reading sans. The contrast is way less pronounced
    than in Optima, the tapering gives Magma a lively character. It\u2019s not unlike
    Syntax, but fresher and more versatile. You can judge it on paper: <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/specimenbookspag.html\">the
    printable specimen pdfs</a> that are available on the Stone Type Foundry\u2019s
    website are very helpful.\r\n\r\nNote that there is an economic \u2018Compact\u2019
    family in between the standard and the Condensed.\r\nFurthermore, Sumner Stone
    has extended the superfamily (which originally started out with <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/basaltoverview.html\">Basalt</a>
    \u2013 two sets of signage caps incl. arrows) with slightly heavier <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/halofontspage.html\">Halo
    grades</a>, light <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/numamagmathinspe.html\">Titling
    weights</a> plus matching archaic Roman forms (<a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/numaoverview.html\">Numa</a>),
    an accompanying uncial (<a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/muncoverview.html\">Munc</a>),
    and a softened spin-off, <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/tuffoverview.html\">Tuff</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    haven\u2019t combined Magma with Cycles, but they should work together quite well.
    You\u2019ll find more options for accompanying sans-serifs in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/39592#comment-258784\">this
    list</a>."
