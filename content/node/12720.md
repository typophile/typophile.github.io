  sidelines!\r\n\r\nThought I'd pose a question: I'm currently designing an identity
  for a client; in terms of presenting work/amounts of work, I'm of the school of
  thought that says present 3 solutions that you're happy with. Sure, you're going
  to have your own favourite from those you show the client, but you wouldn't be gutted
  if they went with any particular one of them. I'd rather do that than show the 5
  or 6 that my boss wants me to produce, because inevitably you get into the 'I'm
  not 100% happy with that logo, but we'll show it' territory and sod's law says that
  that's the one the client will pick!\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone think? Does anyone
  have a routine/system that works for them? Is showing lots of identities only going
  to overwhelm the client?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nSimon"

    each of those three to various situations like publication covers, web masthead,
    embossed, stationery, exhibition &c &c, then your presentation is more effective
    and you can speak with authority on each design. Despite all that Sod's Law dictates
    that your client will change the brief or you will drop your presentation into
    a puddle outside their office.\r\nTim"

  body: "Does your boss want you to produce 5-6, so (s)he can pick 3 to show to the
    client? Who is presenting to the client?\r\n\r\nI gave a talk to a bunch of PR
    people last week, and there were many questions about client-designer relations,
    and I had only one (non-)answer: it's all about communication, and communication
    varies according to the indivituals involved. If it's an old client you know well
    and who trusts you, you can probably produce 1 or 2 roughs and get away w/ it.
    If it's a brand new client you want to impress, give them 4 or 5 to prove your
    versatility, & define wants & needs. If it's the classic \"I don't know what I
    want, but that's not it\" client ... I feel your pain.\r\n\r\nBut you are right,
    never present a design you're not happy with. Like a cat who somehow knows which
    person in the room is alergic to cats, the client can instinctively sense which
    design is the ugliest & most difficult to work with.\r\n\r\nJay\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Guys!\r\n\r\nTim - I laughed out loud at your take on Sod's Law...
    I'm going to be neurotically avoiding puddles from now on!\r\n\r\nJay - It's my
    boss rather than myself  who's showing to a new client... I don't know if it's
    a \"I don't know what I want...\" client - it's too early to tell - if they are,
    my boss hasn't said anything to me so far!\r\n\r\nThanks for the advice\r\n\r\nSi"
