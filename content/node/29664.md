  kerning pairs, all are class-based, (which, once expanded, generate some 27510 pairs).\r\nWhen
  generating/updating kern feature, FL adds a subtable after the 1258th pair, which
  is kinda close to the end of the kern listing.\r\nConsidering the following:\r\n1
  I think I do not have *that* much kerns in comparison to other fonts\r\n2 There's
  a discussion going on about FL possibly adding unnecessary subtables\r\n3 removing
  this sole subtable does not prevent font from compiling and working once installed\r\n\r\nI'd
  like your opinion about this. Could it be something wrong with my kerns or do I
  worry too much or is it perfectly normal and I should leave it?\r\n\r\nAll input
  appreciated :)\r\n\r\nFLSM5.0.2 OSX.4.8 on PPCG5"

    fine  to remove it.

  body: "Thanks, Miguel.\r\nI'm also worrying about the popping-up of this subtable,
    since the kern isn't that big. Could it be somehow related to \"integrity\" and
    consistency of my kerning logic?\r\n(I mean, the kerning might be not as clean
    and logic as I'd like, but FL allow some deviance and adds a subtable or something
    like that)\r\nOr, FontLab is just adding a subtable because the amount of kerns
    justifies it to its eyes\u2026?"

  body: "Jean Baptiste, \r\n\r\nenough to say that the subtable break stuff is complicated
    and that there is currently no satisfactory automated mechanism for generating
    an optimal form of the \"kern\" feature. I hope this will improve in future versions
    of our applications. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"

    as I'm not 100% sure of my kerning technical quality and logic as well."
