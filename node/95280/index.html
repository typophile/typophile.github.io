<blockquote>In adding to this legacy, I am proud to announce that today marks another milestone as Adobe makes yet another type resource freely available by releasing the Source Sans Pro family as our first-ever open source type family.

The brief & development
The primary need for type in Adobe’s open source applications has thus far been for usage within user interfaces. A second environment of perennial interest to Adobe is the realm of text typography. Thus the immediate constraints on the design were to create a set of fonts that would be both legible in short UI labels, as well as being comfortable to read in longer passages of text on screen and in print. In thinking of typeface models that accomplish these tasks well, I was drawn to the forms of the American Type Founders’ gothics designed by Morris Fuller Benton. In particular, I have always been impressed by the forms of his News Gothic and Franklin Gothic, which have been staples for typographers since their introduction in the early twentieth century. While keeping these models in mind, I never sought to copy specific features from these types. Instead, I sought to achieve a similar visual simplicity by paring each glyph to it’s most essential form.</blockquote>

ha-ha!  I missed that, but it's a very good point.
The fashion industry does very well on endless cycles of new cuts and reshapes of the old, and imo the type industry runs on a similar model, but on a bit slower cycles. Then again, what if The Gap started releasing free jeans for all!</div>

@hrant. I would be interested to hear more about why exactly you think that. I tend to agree, but also think there's infinite opportunity for re-invention. So are you thinking that the 'New Retail Sans' is a 'dead end' now more because of 'design' reasons or more 'market reasons'? or both?  I opined in Istanbul that 'free-ness' was now a technical aspect of a font, as important, or more important, as 'legibility' or 'language support'. Adobe's ambitious release of the Source Sans design under a free software license, i think backs that up. It's going to be interesting whether other large foundries identify the same need for 'free-ness' as Adobe have done with SourceSans, and if so, what more free fonts will we be seeing? and what effect this could have?

@Nick Shinn 
Nick, i'm interested what relationship these 'other ideas' may have towards the 'mainstream' and also interested in what relationship they may have towards 'free software' fonts? We are very used to the argument from some that free fonts and/or open source fonts are bad because they cannot be of of highest quality, aka they lower standards. The epitome of that stance could well be Mathew Butterick's (http://typotalks.com/blog/2012/05/19/matthew-butterick/). But when a major foundry puts it's resources behind the design of free fonts, those arguments should be redundant (i would say), and we are just left with not wanting stuff to be free. Is there some inherent threat in 'free-ness', to type designers?

		<div class="commentbody">I addressed this issue some time ago, with regards to the practice of bundling, but it’s a horse I don’t beat any more. 

Chris Anderson’s thinking on the nature of “Free” in the digital realm (<em>Wired</em>, 2008) was very useful in helping me get my head around it. 

As far as this new Adobe face goes, I don’t see it as competition to the kind of design work I do.
Paul Hunt has designed some interesting faces in the past, but here he has put that on hold while working for the Man. Actually, no man at all, compared to Richard Kegler, which might have something to do with it.

My philosophy, which ironically used to be Adobe’s, is that the best product development strategy is to out-innovate the competition.

Therefore, while “Free” may be able to outprice the competition, there is more to marketing than price alone. The holy trinity has always been Price, Quality and Delivery; and design is a quality that will continue to command a premium of some kind, over what is free, even in the digital era. Anderson has gone somewhat <em>volte face</em> on this:

Of course OTF files can be opened and edited in fontlab, but as I understood it, this can sometimes have adverse effects on things like hinting. Have I misunderstood something here?

It is interesting that both Google (Open Sans) and Adobe (Source Sans) have both decided to develop a multi-lingual generic sans, with some very simular features, like seperate styles for /a/, /g/ and /l/. 
Surely the type world is small enough to know what the other is doing at moment, so why no collaboration?

By the way, the use of stylistic sets for several characters, like the /a/ seems to be a bit of strange tactic; of course designers want all their bases covered (you want single story /g/? we got it!), but are these are design decisions, IMHO, and these should be made by the type designer. My idea is that a type designer has an idea about where to take the typeface, including individual character shapes. 

but maybe I am being romantic...?</div>

So do I, but I think you and me are hardly representative. I think nearly everybody else will download and use the readymade fonts package, thus reducing the <em>libre</em> choice to the <em>cheap</em> choice.

I welcome the availability of the Multiple Master sources, and I have the knowledge to build new instances from them, and even write a FontLab script to read the kindly provided TrueType hints in an undocumented format and apply them, or hint the font myself, which may actually be quicker if it’s just one font ;) But who else, especially average users, will do that or even need to do that? And no, in my opinion not everybody will be a font engineer in the future.

Jens, you misunderstood :) 
I meant that 'free-ness' is now an important technical aspect of typeface design. Free-ness is one more aspect of a typeface that must now be considered by type designers, alongside those other aspects, like legibility, language support, etc. If i'd said that 5 years ago, it would have sounded like pure nonsense to most type people. Oh i remember, it did! ;) Now though, it seems like the evidence of it should be fairly obvious. It's irrelevant whether individuals think their own (or any) fonts should be free or not, the fact is 'free-ness' is becoming a central technical consideration of type.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Vernon, allow me to moderate what I wrote... First of all my specific point at that talk was that <em>Turks</em> (and what I meant by extension is any ethnic group, that wants to stand out as such) shouldn't be making generic sans fonts; that they should be exhibiting their own culture (although subtly, not in an in-your-face way) instead of trying to act like generic Europeans. Here's an image I used to illustrate that:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blrand_5587.gif]
You can't tell who made that, where. What is that good for? Maybe making more money for a faceless multinational. But it's not good for culture.

Besides the latching-on I mentioned, another good thing about Source might be that it further weakens the retail market for the generic sans (even though -having that America grot pedigree- it's actually far less generic that something like the font in the image above) forcing designers to wake up and contribute something people should be paying for. Source seems to be exactly the sort of design that should be free.

Concerning "libre" versus "free" versus "gratis" versus whatever, could we get a nice little explanation of how to accurately understand their differences? I've been confused about that for ages.

(I'll try to get to the rest of this nicely flowering thread later.)

		<div class="commentbody">@hrant. Ahhh i see. I remember your talk in Istanbul, and what you say now is the same as what i remember :) I have to agree with you, the local and the vernacular can so easilly get swept aside by the 'International Corporate'. This is why grass roots cultural diversity is so often a good thing, it usually breeds better alternatives to the 'a few models fit all' approach. It's tricky though, for example, the face in your example, i don't see as particularly 'faceless', even though i guess it's maybe meant to be.

Re - the terminology of 'libre', 'gratis', 'free' etc. The key to all this is licensing, it is not about how much money is paid/not paid.
'Libre' is a term used more and more because it helpfully underlines the 'freedom' of 'free software', that unfortunately 'FREE' in English fails to do :)  because 'free software' sounds only about not paying for it. Other languages usually don't have this confusion, trust the English language to equate 'freedom' with 'not paying'.

So... one major point of Libre / Free software is that it's licensing ensures that it is non-proprietary, it can never be sole property, it can 'belong' to anyone who uses it, and anyone who uses it also has the freedom to alter it, add to it, share it, etc. Of course in order to be fully free to be altered, added to, shared etc the software must also be freely available in it's source form. So with fonts - a compiled truetype font, with machine level hinting code, quadratic curves and OpenType tables etc etc etc does not enable the user the full freedom to alter the original design and function of the font. To give full freedom to the user, the user also needs the original source files that the truetype font was compiled from.

'Open Source' is a technical approach to this scenario, literally meaning that the source code of software should be open. However, there's a philosophical difference here, as there are other reasons for opening up source code. Some people open their source code because they believe that software should be totally free (as in Libre) and that only free software allows people control over software (instead of giving software corporations control over people), but others do it for far more 'technical' and less 'ideological' reasons.

I'm guessing Adobe is in the latter camp, and that their reasons for releasing Source Sans under a free software license is technical rather than ideological.

I think it can certainly be a bit of both. One reason I say this is that every Adobe employee I personally know (not an army of them, but still) is a Good Guy.

Of course. And i certainly don't think 'ideological reason=good guy / technical reason = not good guy', as long as both routes respect 'freedom' then both are valid, interesting and good.  Also i would be fairly certain than within a large software corporation like that, there could be a very mixed view on developing & releasing a pro-level font family as free software :)</div>

So, you could combine or even integrate GIMP, Fontforge, Inkscape and Scribus, shovel on a bunch of OFL fonts and sell the resulting package.

One thing I have not tried but which Fontforge claims it can do is add a table (PfEd) with the info needed to recreate the original SFD source file from just the OTF file.</div>

I think that idea is a little outdated nowadays, but it's fair enough. I tend to think that if someone was ambitious and smart enough to actually manage to sell individual 'free' fonts, they probably deserve whatever they can get ;) plus a shiny Award for Aptitude. In fact, i have come across a handfull of instances when companies have wanted to use some of my free fonts, but claim their policy insists they must pay for them.

Vern, that has happened to me as well. 
They want to pay for a license that they don't really need.. funny thing.
In that cases, I usually explain why they are Ok with the Libre license and how the OFL works, and suggest a donation instead of a payment.
If they insist, I sell them a copy of the font, but using a commercial license instead.

Seems that the legal departments inside some companies always require them to pay for fonts, even if the fonts are Libre. I guess they don't know yet about the Libre fonts world.

From my experience lawyers are a bit cleverer than this. My guess is that in paying for the fonts they get some kind of buyer's legal protection they wouldn't otherwise get by using the free version. You might want to consider having a separate commercial license drawn up that limits your liability.</div>

Yes, i had guessed it was something like that. I have never had someone asking for this who knew why they needed to pay. It seems like a requirement that's been lowered from a distant office, and i've never pushed too far to find out. Plus, i make it clear, they are not paying for the fonts, they are only making a voluntary donation.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Reynir, what may cause confusion here is a real distinction between what you or I might consider a programming language, and hence what constitutes a computer program, and the legal definition of a computer program according to the registrar of copyright or other intellectual property protection in a given jurisdiction. So, for instance, the US Copyright Office defines a computer program very generously as 'a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result', and extends protection 'to all the copyrightable expression embodied in the computer program'. The inclusion of statements as well as instructions in the definition, and the allowance of indirect as well as direct use in bringing about 'a certain result', opens a pretty wide door.</div>

Not really. In this sense, the stroke model would only be useful for a purely geometrical design, with no optical compensation, modulation, or visual interest. Once you start trying to make a real typeface based on a stroke model you end up with something like Metafont, which is the opposite of easy for an end user. I think this conception of type design fails to appreciate the painstaking skill type designers need, and the thousands of decisions that go into a typeface, or how to add weight to make a bold. It's a thinking process that cannot be satisfactorily reduced to mechanics.</div>

For the record though Metafont doesn't have to be stroke-based*; better to refer to something like Computer Modern, where no matter how many contortions you go through you can't get to where you need to be.
