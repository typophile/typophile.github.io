  font validator finds no problems with them.\r\nThey work with freetype.\r\nMy own
  validation tools can find no problems (but that may not say much).\r\n\r\nThey don't
  work on the mac. The mac somewhat randomly picks a few fonts in the ttc file and
  adds them to its font list. Font Book's Validation command claims that all the fonts
  in the ttc have \"Serious Problems\" in \"System Validation\" -- whatever that may
  mean.\r\n\r\nIf I extract a font from the ttc file, including all tables unchanged,
  then Font Book will happily validate the resultant ttf file.\r\n\r\nIf I take a
  standard ttc font (I used gulim.ttc) and subjected it to Font Book I got exactly
  the same problems.\r\n\r\nI have tried this on 10.4 and 10.5 with similar results.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  know what might be going on?\r\n"

    know 10.4 and 10.5 nominally support TTCs, but I was wondering how solid that
    support is, and I fear you've answered the question.  :/\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Unfortunately, getting useful information out of Apple about the nature of
    Font Book errors is sometimes challenging....especially around the time of a new
    Mac OS Release :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nI've had similar experience with TTCs under 10.5:
    some are okay, some raise vague errors like \"missing OpenType data\" with no
    detail as to what is missing, and there does not seem to be any publicly-accessible
    documentation on the errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne possibility: are the TTCs you're testing
    all \"large\" (many glyphs)? At one time I was going to look into the possibility
    of a format 2 'post' table with name indices >= 32768 being an issue, based on
    a very strict interpretation of the OpenType spec (\"Index numbers 32768 through
    65535 are reserved for future use\") but I never chased that down to confirm.\r\n\r\n"
