		<div class="commentbody">&quot;Keyholes don't look like that anymore.&quot; <BR> <BR>True, but we all know that is a keyhole. And plenty of great older homes still have that trademark keyhole. <BR> <BR>#1 is too literal. <BR> <BR>#2 has potential. I agree with Soren. If not remove the bottom stroke, perhaps just shorten it to give it the 'hint' of a bottom strok. <BR> <BR>#3 I like for some reason. The keyhole is obviously horizontal, which doesn't make a lot of sense, but I do like the form. <BR> <BR>But perhaps the concept of an actual 'key' is maybe just too literal. To be fair, 'TurnKey' is a pretty generic name to begin with, so you don't have a lot to work with.</div>

It feels like you are forcing an insignifigant relationship between the R and a keyhole. I am not getting a reward out of this logo &quot;yet&quot;.  I was under the assumtion that the website was rewarding it's users if they were to &quot;Turn the Key&quot;, turning the key I assume is a metaphor for the unlimited access to the real estate market the website provides.

Remember, Helvetica has become very popular again. Like fashion, typefaces come into vogue. Maybe you are a trend setter</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&quot;the logo needs to communicate that with TurnKey, creating a website is easy and simple&quot; <BR> <BR>Sally, I'm sorry but I don't think you've achieved the goal you set for yourself. The logos you've created thus far say 'real estate' but more in the sense of a real estate agency, not a service for realitors. Is Turnkey a software program? A template to download? How will the logo be used? on packaging? on-line? The fonts you've been using give the design a delicate look. Appropriate for an agency that specializes in million + estates, but is it appropriate for this client and their product? If simple is the main concept you wish to communicate I think the logo is still too complex. The two-tone key hole is distracting and personally I don't think the shadow 3-d effect adds anything to your icon, and I do like the key hole. I know you are planning on wrapping this up soon. I'm sorry if this sounds negative - it's not meant to be. Your designs look nice, and are leaning towards quite elegant. It's just that from your own description it seems like they aren't hitting the mark yet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">i never mind visual suggestions &ndash; usually much easier to get the idea visually instead of descriptively. <BR> <BR>Thank you everybody for your thoughts and ideas. <BR> <BR>The client really wanted to go with an icon, which is why this final concept features the keyhole icon instead of the further development of the abstract keyhole R. <BR> <BR>This logo focus more on the &quot;turn&quot; and portrays better the image of an easy, straight-forward, and professional way to create a real estate website. <BR> <BR>This is the concept the client has chosen to go with. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions of ways to finalized this logo further, I welcome them. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Sally <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48758.gif" alt=""></div>
