  talking about new typefaces or anything, but more like someone making chairs out
  of letterforms or someone doing typography in a non-conventional method. More in
  the Art realm...\r\n\r\nRight now I am gathering names for a possible exhibit on
  typefaces so any ideas would be welcomed! :) Thanks in advance. "

  body: Man, I wish I could remember the name of the guy from TypeCon this past summer
    that I helped setup his exhibit. He had all sorts of art created with type glyphs
    made out of kiln fired clay. He was from Illinois if I remember correctly. He
    did the Alphabet City display where he took bitmap images of a glyph and projected
    it onto a board where the negative space was the glyph and the positive space
    were vertical clay structures of varying height. Anyone else know what I'm talking
    about?
