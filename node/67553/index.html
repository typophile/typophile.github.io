		<div class="commentbody">Personally, I'd take option 1, but I also know that several of my former colleagues at Adobe were quite convinced that oldstyle numerals were the right thing to use with small caps.

It gets more complicated than that, too. As the user could turn on multiple of these features, as the type designer you need to decide what happens in those conflicts. For example, which takes precedence on the numbers, 'c2sc' or 'onum'? I'd vote for c2sc.

This enables me to employ both tabular and proportional smallcap numerals, based on the previous numeral style selection.

Well, you can still do it as a type designer: let tnum and pnum work on your "default figures" and still have the small cap figures overridden if either onum or lnum is applied. But of course InDesign and friends don't respect this, because of their simplified model of applying multiple features at once for figures.... sigh.

Well, I can't complain, I guess. When the function was being implemented in InDesign 2.0, the engineer (hi Eric) ran it by me and either he or somebody was trying to simplify and combine things in the UI, because there were so many OpenType layout features. At the time nobody was talking about doing these sorts of tricky things with figure styles... so it didn't even occur to me that there could be an issue, or if it did it was very hypothetical, not being driven by actual fonts people were trying to make not working properly.

Dang.

The implementation of lnum/onum & pnum/tnum is certainly one area where Quark’s approach seems more straightforward and sensible than Adobe’s.

Quark, left; InDesign, right:

Honestly, I’m not sure how presenting the four combinations of the 2&times;2 matrix is any simpler, in terms of the UI, than just providing the two sets of paired variables.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have considered producing one set of tabular figures, and kerning them to produce proportional spacing.

So the user gets proportional with kerning turned on, and tabular with it off.
(The same principle could be applied to monospaced typefaces in general: several people have inquired whether a kerned version of Panoptica was available, which is what prompted the idea.)

However, I abandoned this technique, as it would require too much metadata in order to be effective.
In other words, it's unlikely that users would be aware that such "a feature" was in a font, even if it was mentioned in, say, a pdf specimen. </div>

It seems that there isn't a consensus on this issue. For now, I've decided to have small figures accessed via both 'smcp' and 'c2sc'; oldstyle figures will be accessible via 'onum' provided neither 'smcp', 'c2sc', nor 'case' is active.

Indeed it is a small world. Dennis is an old friend of mine.

		<div class="commentbody">As a book designer, I would prefer that an option for having oldstyle figures with my small caps were available. Your scheme would prevent that without manually highlighting figures and turning off {smcp}. 

If your preference is to have small caps figs subbed in with your {smcp} and {c2sc} features, then I suggest letting {onum} override them and ordering {onum} later in your feature file, so that users have some viable option.

I dislike stylistic features that are not easily “turnoffable.”

That’s my 2¢.</div>
