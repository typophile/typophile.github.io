		<div class="commentbody">Tennis shoes and fonts do not compare. For one thing honest tennis shoe users do not have to carry the burden of thousands more dishonest ones. Those who buy fonts are paying for the thousands more that are pirated. Hence, a catch 22: I'm sorry, a type face is not worth 200 dollars in the marketplace&ndash;particularly to students and low-brow design shops, which, hate them or not, do the great majority of the work in America. They are the guys that do ugly yellow page ads for plumbers, and make ugly vinyl signs for chinese take-out. It's work that has to be done, and they can't pay $200 for a china-town type face ripped off from some dead designer from the fifties. (He doesn't get royalties). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Piracy will not stop until type foundries lower their prices to a reasonable level. Unfortunately they cannot do that until the piracy stops. Catch 22.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About billing clients: Type can't really be compared to illustrations or photography, that are typically purchased for one use. As I mentioned earlier, Wong's Chinese Takeout won't pay $200 for a type face. What's more, if they would, shouldn't they get the licence for the next time they need to change the price on won-ton soup? We don't often bill clients for software, why should we bill them for type? Why would we not let them know it if we did? I'm not trying to be moralistic here. I have billed clients for type. I just don't think it's that easy of an issue. We would be miffed if a wrench showed up on our mechanic's bill. Type is different from a wrench, but how much so? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't believe in piracy. In my life I have only pirated about 5 faces, a few of which are shame- facedly huddled in a folder on my hard-drive marked &quot;pirated&quot;, each one hoping to one day be legitimized or deleated. But&hellip; I unabashedly download mp3's and don't buy all the cds. Then again, I listen to the same songs on the radio without paying a thing either. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Someone needs to bite the bullet here. As a designer who uses type, I would hope to be honest. As a designer who sells type&ndash; I should charge an honest price for a type face. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I will probably charge as much as I can like anyone else, dang it. I guess I'm just saying, it's not a simple issue. One thing's for sure&ndash; it shouldn't be illegal to embed a font in a document. Go home emigre.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Christian, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The radio analogy doesn't work completely either, because, while you may not pay for the music directly, the advertisers pay the radio station, and the station pays royalty-type fees (BMI, ASCAP, etc.) for the music. The advertisers recoup their money from sales to you, the radio listener. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This system is not all that unlike the system that has evolved for typefaces, especially given the increasing notion of &quot;subscription&quot; or &quot;library&quot; discounts &ndash; licensing a foundry's entire library for a one-time fee that represents a substantial discount over the costs of each font individually. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, while a font family can seem expensive to license at $200, it is also (more or less, in most cases) a lifetime license that can be used over and over again. Looking at the body of licensed fonts that I use most often, and breaking them down across all the various client projects on which they have been used, I could certainly easily recoup my costs of licensing by charging a flat rate $10 or even $5 font licensing fee to my clients. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Admittedly, this is not something I have been doing, but it sounds like a reasonable idea that I will now seriously consider. I can't imagine a single client that would have a problem paying it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David</div>

Indeed, the shareware arrangement is exactly as you described. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, for fonts offered by most companies, whether by online sale, CD sale or mail order sale, it's pretty clear that they don't intend even a file transfer unless the licensing fee is paid. There is a distinct difference between this kind of licensing and the licensing offered by a shareware agreement. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Further, in cases where licenses have been enforced, even having the unlicensed file in your possession (on a hard drive, backup disk, etc.) is enough to invoke the penalty fine, which can be as much as $150,000, and that's for EACH unlicensed software (including fonts). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In addition, the Business Software Alliance (BSA) has been formed to investigate suspected cases of pirating, and they issue press releases listing business small and large that have been found to be using pirated software of any type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I certainly couldn't afford the consequences of being caught using pirated software (including fonts), and I don't want to contribute to the damage that piracy inflicts on the creative community either. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sorry if this is coming across as preachy or holier-than-thou.

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With all respect (and I DO respect your opinion, as I hope you know by now <!-- raw HTML omitted --> ) I think your analysis of the Napster case is extremely oversimplified. I'm not sure how you determined that &quot;only the most wealthy and successful artists argued on the side of the prosecution.&quot; That wasn't my perception at all, but I won't try to guess what everyone else's opinion was. The fact of the matter is that American (and many other nations') copyright laws were being violated, harming the interests of the artists who created the work. That millions of people may have been taking part in this doesn't change that fact, nor does their opinion (or other artists' opinions) that they had a &quot;right&quot; to freely distribute the artists' work. The law says that they didn't, and the courts upheld this. That's a strong precedent that can (and should) be applied to the protection of type designers' interests as well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Whether CD knockoffs or pirated fonts are more damaging to the industry is not the issue; they are BOTH damaging to the industry, and the industry must be protected from both. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The difference in the case you mentioned is that the Underware Foundry CHOSE to give their fonts away for free. Bravo; more power to them. Again, what you are describing is SHAREWARE. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shouldn't designers who choose to SELL licenses to their fonts also have that right, AND have the ability to enforce that right? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a type designer myself, I will probably choose to freely distribute some of my works, as a way of publicly promoting my other designs. Shouldn't I have the right to choose which of my own designs to distribute freely, and which of my designs to demand a licensing fee for their use? And shouldn't the law protect and provide enforcement for that right? No one has a &quot;right&quot; to use my work without providing me just compensation for it, and the same goes for any artist, designer or any other producer of goods or services. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I know from reading licensing agreements that many other type designers feel the same way about their work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I laugh when I hear the type foundries talking about copyright. More than any other field type foundries copy the designs of others (living and dead). How many imitation faces are there in my URW type library? The question gets stickier when we start to talk about plagiarism&ndash; but maybe we are approaching this the wrong way. There is great value in many people attacking the same problem. In type design more than anything else, it is hard to draw the line where one face starts looking too similar to another. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What about sign painters? They didn't pay to licence lettering styles done by other people (any more than punch cutters did). Why is it so sacred when it gets in digital format&ndash; because it becomes software? It's not like other software. I think more designers should modify the fonts they work with for specific jobs (just like sign painters did). Why not alter a few charactaristics in a font? The original designer took a great deal from other designers. What if a few of his/her letters don't work so well for a specific project. Our society's idea of ownership is wacked out. Logotypes in particular&ndash; It is pathetic how many logotypes are simply a typed font. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why weren't designers affraid when they were borrowing each other's letters while painting them? Beceause they were all creating. They were all interpreting. The way you stay ahead is by adding something new. Why don't more designers do this now? We often hold type design in such awe that hardly anyone does it. &quot;I'm not a type designer&quot; I hear this all the time. How can you be a designer and not design type? What do you do with logo types? It's different for text faces, which are more technical, but still&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I mentioned, type is different from other software. All software requires a user to have software to work with files. However, there are only a handful of formats. With fonts, there are thousands on thousands. Should prepress shops, or even designers working in collaboration have to licence fonts separately? Should one user have to licence a font twice for different machines? What if there are many users using one machine, like in a computer lab. Should each user have to licence the font, or should the lab have to pay more because more people are using it? How about embeding fonts in documents&ndash; can't have that outline information out there. Everyone is afraid of the digital format. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One last thing: Historical faces. Somehow, when a designer is dead, this gives us a right to steal their work? YES. It makes sense to everyone. Everyone adapts historical faces and takes great pride in it. Why not adapt living people's faces. Of course credit should be given where credit is due. The same goes for artists covering songs. Some of the coolest songs are covers&hellip; but licensing so often gets in the way (that's one reason I like file-swapping). What happened to the days where standards were sung by everyone, everyone giving their unique twist? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We keep talking about the morals of ownership. What does ownership mean when it comes to ideas, designs, creativity? We tend to view ideas in terms of the equation: Ideas = Money. Therefore, to use someone elses idea is stealing their money. But no idea, or creative leap is based on itself&ndash; they all borrow from others. Really the underlying idea is: all designers should get compensated for thier work. It just so happens that the system we live in functions under the i=$ equation, and therefore we assign ownership to ideas. It doesn't mean that there aren't other ways to compensate those who do the work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm trying to think of some other ways of doing this. I'm trying to get further outside the box.</div>

We believe, as I suppose most of you do, that typefaces should be protected by copyright. The current standard for copyright persistence is 75 years after the death of the author. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Therefore I think it's implied, because of the combination of the TypeRight mission statement and the ethics guide, that we believe that all type should be so protected, or rather be regarded has having such protection - whether an individual state allows for such protection or not. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ie, ethically we believe that 75 years after the death of the author any revivals etc can take place without the permission of the author's estate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On a personal level I have some problems with this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firstly, 75 years after the authors death could be 100-150 years after the creation of the item. This seems like an exceptionally long period of time to protect the rights of the author (as he or she has been dead for some time). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the same time I think it unreasonable for people to directly copy the work of others and earn a profit from it - ie when the work is out of copyright. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, my compromise on this is, that whatever the state decides is reasonable copyright persistence, for all creative works, should be my guiding light. ie if the law states copyright for literature or music should persist until death + 75 years, then ethically I believe that the same standard should apply to type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As to the &quot;correct&quot; way to &quot;revive&quot; a face? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To do it properly you have to go back to the sources and study them. A revival of Garamond for example is not copying one of the modern Garamond interpretations (as these are revivals themselves). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's worth noting in this case that Adobe Garamond has a design patent - so is protected in its design as being original. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;2) It has become standard operating procedure  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;for the free-font crowd to make a font <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;based on a car, movie or TV logo, or some  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;'found glyphs'. Or to make a font based  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;on some signage that was discovered over  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;on fourth street. What is appropriate  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;and what isn't? Does the designer of the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;logos or the sign painter factor into  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;this equation or are glyphs and logos  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;treated differently than an entire font. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Further, what if you see ONE letter and make  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;a face based on that. What if the face is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;based on TWENTY LETTERS? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In some cases I think that faces that copy directly from a logo and expand on that may well be infringing copyright, design patent and/or trademark - in such cases it's up to the rights holder to enforce the law. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, again, I think this is covered in the ethics guide. It would be unethical to copy the work of others directly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As to the level of that&hellip; I think pretty much from scratch. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My personal view on typeface copying is that it's not a matter of a certain number of characters being the same, but of the character of the whole face in use being the same. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course at the same time there have been, and continue to be, many designers that take influence from &quot;found&quot; typography. Probably the most famous example of this is Erik van Blokland's Trixie - indeed Letterror did a whole series of such faces. And of course later there were many, many &quot;dirty typewriter faces&quot; copying Letterror's &quot;original&quot; idea. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In such cases I think we have to consider what the end result was, and whether the source was something &quot;generic&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clearly a logo is not &quot;generic&quot; it has a specific purpose and is probably quite recent in its design (for it to be thought &quot;worthy&quot; of copying). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand a font based on a stencil or a typewiter can be seen as generic because the essential form has been in use for perhaps hundreds or years - often dictated by an industrial process of some kind. In any event no author or copyright holder is known. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Somewhere between these extremes are the styles used in signage. Again some of these styles may have been in use for hundreds of years, many are based on &quot;generic&quot; forms of handwriting and often the author of the original is unknown. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think in these cases one must take an objective view: is the subject matter specific or generic. If it is specific then you are probably beyond the bounds of the TypeRight ethics guide. If it is generic then you are probably acting ethically. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One thing however I would consider in the latter case: if the subject is generic, then what would be the point of copying it, except to create another generic work? I'd also question, whether, as a designer, you would really gain anything from such a project with its inherent lack of creativity on your part.</div>

In the liner notes, it's all about 'I found this face while looking through a 1920s magazine' and I made it into a font.'   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, creativity is my lifeblood and soul mate and type design is just another outlet. I love it!

		<div class="commentbody">From a a personal perspective I wouldn't place much weight on any information at Luc's site. While it does contain a lot of good information it is let down by some stuff that seems to warp the facts to some private agaenda, for instance: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Clive's fonts Julius and Adams Rounded are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;slight adjustments of Avenir and VAG Rounded. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Now, if they had been exact copies, the font <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;world would have had its very own Captain Hook. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hmm, so I do some font adaptions, clearly labelled as such, and within the licence of the originals (only for use where a licence exists for the original and not to be redistributed or sold) and I'm a pirate!? In the case of the Avenir/Julius fonts I actually organised the whole job with the cooperation of Linotype and ended up buying a 5,000 user licence for a corporate client. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or this: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Erik van Blokland discusses the value of type,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;and in particular argues about the added value  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;in good typefaces. He concludes with a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;commendable argument against the cheap font  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;CDs (blue collar crime)&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nice one Erik, good article you made some excellent points <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;but fails to mention that most rip-offs in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;world are actually committed by the major <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;companies (white collar crime), and by nearly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;every corporate font designer. Does he not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;remember how Bitstream and URW started? Or how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Monotype helped itself to Zapf's Palatino?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Or how Tiro's Aeneas is strongly based on a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;font by Werner Schneider? Article dated 1997. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What!? Erik writes an opinion piece of about 900 words, which is mostly non-specific in identifying pirates (except that the devil of the day, SSi, is named) and he's criticised for not identifying every piece of font piracy that ever happened!? Sorry, every piece of alledged piracy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm sure that Erik is very aware of the foundations on which Bitstream and URW were laid.</div>

We're going back to the early to mid 1970s here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->URW consequently received a lot of contract work from the large foundries of the time (Linotype, Berthold&hellip;) to digitise their fonts for their dedicated typesetting systems. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You have to remember here that hardware was the important thing to these foundries, fonts were just packages to help sell the hardware. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part of the contract between URW and the foundries stipulated that URW owned the data that they digitised. No one thought anything of this at the time, because URW was not selling typesetting systems (required to use the fonts) and was in no position to set up such a business. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now fast forward 10-15 years. Apple introduces the Macintosh in 1984 and within 7-8 years had effectively killed the traditional typesetting businesses and the hardware suppliers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now type is hardware independent and can be used in almost any application on several platforms. No longer dedicated to one application running on one particular piece of hardware. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->URW finds itself with the rights to a huge library of other people's fonts. Or, more precisely, URW finds itself with the rights to the outline data of such fonts but not the names. So it bundles itself up a CD-ROM and starts selling the data as PostScript fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Several people tried to take action against URW and failed, because of the contracts they signed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moral of the story is: this is actually a complicated legal issue, compounded by the fact that the old foundries didn't have crystal balls and could not foresee that their businesses would undergo fundamental changes due to revolutionary change in software and hardware in other fields.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;But two things I disagree with:  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;1. Legal = Ethical? Not! Not even &quot;guiding light&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't think I really wrote legal = ethical. I think what I wrote was that where copyright is in place then legal should pretty much = ethical. Where copyright or similar protection is not in place then one should look to the way other works are protected by copyright and adopt that standard for your ethics. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, in the EU we don't have a problem because all 15 states are compelled by a directive to have protection in place, 75 years after death. So I think it's reasonable to adopt that standard ethically (for the reasons I've already stated). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the US there's no copyright protection for type. So what I'm advocating is that ethically one should look at how music, photography and literature are protected and adopt that standard. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, other items protected by copyright in the US are protected for 75 years after death, therefore ethically you should adopt that standard to type too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll expand upon why I think that at this point it's ethical to &quot;copy&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One must realise that there are many aspects to intellectual property protection than type, for example literature and music and other areas like patent for machines and drugs etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Legally, various governments have come up with very similar rules to govern the protection of such. And generally I think they've pretty much come to good compromises. I don't think it's apropriate for drug patents to last 150 years or more, neither do governments, so they are restricted to 15-20 years. There are at least some moral arguments for this being too long, but there must be some compromise. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I think that if you take in some of the wider issues of IP protection, legal = ethical. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are of course some anomalies, the US position of type copyright being one of them. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;2. Luc's site is not perfect, but nothing is.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;However, Luc's input is very valuable in  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;casting a cold hard light on many &quot;covert&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;aspects of the sometimes dirty business of  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;type design. He's one of the few people  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;unafraid of the Gray. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Please, one example of this &quot;cold hard light&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All I can see are quite a few unwarrented attacks on people, driven by some weird agenda. There's no uncovering of facts here, the facts have been obscured where they are quite clearly known. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How are the quotes noted above about Erik van Blokland and myself, as well as the attack on Simon Daniels, displaying courage in exposing the &quot;gray&quot;? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I wrote before Luc's site is quite useful, but is let down by such nonsense. He seems to take everything he is told at face value without checking any underlying facts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Christian: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;How subtle does an original idea have to be to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;be original? We are killing creativity with our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;silly copyright laws. Why shouldn't someone  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;alter a font to fit their needs? Why can't we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;admit that all creativity takes from other <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;people's ideas. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Um, well this question needs to go through the whole overview of intellectual property protection, why it was put in place and its historical context. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And there's no way I'm going into all of that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, I can perhaps answer the part about originality and subtlety. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Copyright protection extends to items which are original. ie items that are not derived from others. So, where there is clear derivation from a known original the copyright of the orginal persists. Something that is derived from something else cannot be wholly original in itself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, there is one area of copyright that does allow for some measure of &quot;sameness&quot;. That is that works created independently can have equal protection, even though they appear to be derived from another source. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For example, if I write a poem, and you write one too, and they turn out to be identical, or very close to each other, then as long as I haven't seen your poem and you haven't seen mine, or work contibuting to them, then we both have protection and neither is infringing the other. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note that this doesn't apply to patent where uniqueness is required. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;This doesn't deny that bad rip-offs are just, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; well, bad. But why should a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;subtle, yet beautiful, variation be illegal?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A variant is clearly derived, so therefore it would be illegal, yes. There are exceptions, most foundries permit you to modify fonts you've paid for, with the restriction that you cannot redistibute them, or that they cannot be used where a licence for the original doesn't exist. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is logical if you think about it, because oherwise you could make a slight adjustment to something and then distribute it, what income would the original author have? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Are we only concerned about money here? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, pretty much. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However there are other aspects. Getting further into the background of IP protection it is essentially a deal between creators and government to protect the rights of the creators while giving access to the public. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let's say that writers didn't have protection for their work, what encouragement would there be for them to expend much effort on creating new work? They would publish and anyone else could copy the original and sell it as their own. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But we do have protection for literature and consequently we have the choice of hundreds of thousands of books at a reasonable price. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This principal works across all IP. If the creator can get an income from their work then that encourages them to produce further work, it makes it cheap for the public to buy and it gives more choice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The best thing about this is that it actually does work and has been proven to work over a hundred years or more. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If creators were not rewarded in monetary forms to pay for their efforts then probably the majority of output would be on an amateur level.</div>
