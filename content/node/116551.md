  body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nWe have retired the Photofont plugins because they no longer
    worked in modern InDesign or Photoshop versions, and it was a nuisance and significant
    effort to have to keep them up-to-date for every new version of Adobe apps. \r\n\r\nThe
    replacement product is FontLab Pad: http://www.fontlab.com/pad \r\n\r\nIt does
    not integrate with Photoshop or InDesign as much (it's a separate app and you
    need to do copy-paste or export-import in order to get the text into the Adobe
    app), but it supports all of Unicode, all the modern color font formats that TransType
    can produce (but also the classic Photofont PHF files of course). It comes with
    the nice \"transparent background\" feature so you can place its window directly
    over InDesign and you'll see how your Photofont headline will look in the document.
    And it exports not only PNG bitmaps but also SVG and PDF graphics. \r\n\r\nWe
    will be publishing an update to FontLab Pad in the coming weeks which fixes a
    few bugs (kerning in some PHF files does not currently work correctly, though
    in most it works fine; also, the text selection highlight gets exported so currently
    you have to deselect the text before exporting) and also adds a few improvements.
    If you run into any problems in FontLab Pad that did not occur with the old Photofont
    products, please let me know directly to adam at fontlab dot com. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam
    Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd."
