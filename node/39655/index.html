It’s just like this: If every single type ID request has a title like ‘Help me!!!’ or ‘WHAT IS THIS PLZ?’, then it’s pretty hard to find related stuff later, and people who would know the answer likely won’t join it.
Yves didn’t bother to write the <a href="http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq/#Q_2">FAQ</a> without a cause, and still hardly anyone seems to pay attention to it. It’s not Patty’s fault, you know …</div>

<p>Although I&rsquo;ve edited it now but initially the &ldquo;title&rdquo; for this thread was just &ldquo;Type ID&rdquo;. 
As Patty said, the title itself should have a little description about the thread so that interested Typophiles can guess whether they are able to answer or not without opening the thread. ( Most of the time it works ). Also, it save lots of time and make it easy to find the threads later.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Often when one makes strong, definitive statements or observations - like politicians, for example - there always are people comparing their words to previous things that person said. For what reason I do not know &hellip; maybe to tear them down, prove them to be some kind of fraud, or whatever.</p>
<p>In this case, however, it seems Mr. Cordoba has attempted to do that with words that only further solidify my original statements.</p>
<p>In the above quoted text, Mr. Cordoba seems to take issue with my saying PFab &ldquo;&hellip;(c)ertainly she doesn’t have to praise everyone - or anyone, really&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>First and foremost, there is a difference between being told how what to say and how to say it, and the comment quoted above. For example, I would never suggest PFab EVER be stripped of her right to scold every single person here, if that&rsquo;s her thing. I don&rsquo;t particularly find it useful, but she absolutely has the right to do it.</p>
<p>If I were interested in controlling PFab&rsquo;s words and actions, I&rsquo;d either have asked/told her to stop ridiculing/scolding people around here completely, or told her what and how to go about her scolding. However, I did none of those things. In fact I was merely attempting to elicit from PFab a side I am sure she must have, because I&rsquo;m betting she has quite a few entertaining, funny and certainly educational things to say.</p>
<p>When writing what you quoted above, I was responding to PFab&rsquo;s post telling me I needed to be more concise when posting my thoughts. That&rsquo;s telling me how to write something from which I was seeking a specific result. As a comparison, I would have a hard time with anyone telling PFab to be less gender- or age-specific when berating people around here (not saying she attacks any particular age or gender, just an example).</p>
<p>As for the SPECIFIC words quoted, I actually was attempting to entice PFab away from the Dark Side and to the side of The Force by informing her that doing so didn&rsquo;t come with the expectation that she should glad-hand everyone and spread artificial joy.</p>
<p>I hate getting into philosophical things like this but I do take such issues quite serious and make a concerted effort on a day-to-day basis to not tread on anyone else&rsquo;s freedoms. If PFab wishes to do nothing but scold people on this board for the rest of her cyberlife, more power to her. I just feel like there must be a goldmine of really neat, fun stuff buried somewhere in her brain and I for one would love to see it. After all, I&rsquo;ve looked through her work and she sure seems to have quite a bit going for her intellectually.</p>
<p>If anyone - such as Mr. Cordoba - read into my words anything different, I apologize. However, keep trying to find those contradictions &hellip; although I should warn you they are few and far between, if they exist at all.</p>

<p>While all that glistens certainly might not be gold, I always was dumb enough to believe the phrase &ldquo;curiouser and curiouser&rdquo; came from Alice in Wonderland, a true literary masterpiece second only to Horton hears a Who?</p>
<p>Though this started out as a legitimate albeit poorly labeled (initially) typography thread, it&rsquo;s turned into something for everyone. Still I&rsquo;m crushed that no one got or laughed at my little joke. You know, PFab&rsquo;s logo, the backward &hellip; ah never mind. Tough crowd.</p>

<p>Christopher: Yep, it&rsquo;s from <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, all right. As for the earlier post of yours that I quoted from: I felt like you had some sort of grudge against Ms. Fab, and that it dated back to that thread. As for contradictions, we all have &lsquo;em, like it or not. But I&rsquo;m not out to find supposed contradictions, and I don&rsquo;t mean to start a flame war. My apologies to all concerned, including the moderators I unwittingly dragged in here!</p>
