For learning fontlab studio I took my favourite font DIN 1451 and added some ligatures. When the course entitled "Project work" came around I had already set my mind to either doing my own complete font, or modernizing DIN as far as time would allow me to. The course gave me 100 hours, but I likely put in closer to twice that.

		<div class="commentbody">Typophile forums beeing somewhat unintuitive, I wanted to save-mid writing and ended up posting that.

What I actually did was
Adding glyphs to make it support Unicode Basic latin, latin-1 supplement & Latin Extended-A
Added and coded 13 ligatures, alternate ligatures (and made two stylistic alternate of ligatures)
Added a few (poorly implemented) characters and glyphs, alpha, omega, florin and a few others.
Added stylistic alternates (rounded letters with dieresis and i dots / dashed 0 and unimplemented alternate ligatures)
Added a few kerning classes & exceptions.

Both myself and my teacher/handler enjoyed this project.
I'll gladly take comments, critique or whatever you'd like to say.

I'd also like to point out that this was my first real typographic work / time using fontlab and that I was 17 when I made this.</div>

There is however a gray area, at least when it comes to <em>certain</em> Adobe fonts: if all parties involved buy a license to the original, they should be OK in acquiring the derivative as well.

		<div class="commentbody">I can see few problems in diacritics, that you should solve before trying to do anything more with it:

- Polish ogonek is not a some addon or accent like acute or slash, it is a intergral part of a letter. So in most cases it's smoothly connected to the letter. See polish diacritics at bottom.
- Caron should be in optical middle of the letter. See diacritics.eu at bottom. 
- Caron with /t, /d, /l (ť, ď, ľ) should be more closer to the letter and tighter. 
- Ring over letter like Ů should be much more stronger.
- Circumflex above h should be above the stem in the middle. See ilovetypography.com at bottom.
- I think breve is too wide. 
- Double crossed t? (9th line at the end)
- tcedilla should be tcommaacent
- udieresis is missing (or it isn't on behance) uhungarumlaut is only for hungarian language
- commaaccent diacritics is missing - letters like R, N, G, T, r, n, g, t

		<div class="commentbody">Jan, I greatly appreciate you taking the time to write all this help.
My project wasn't to re-make anything DIN 1451 has, it was to extend and modernize it, hence I didn't do üÜ/ß (even if I could perhaps do a lowercase eszett).

Frankly, in my unknowing pursuit of making something acceptable for personal use, I just went after Latin extended-A and the parts of Latin-1 Supplement I had time for.
(these exact lists
http://www.decodeunicode.org/en/latin_extended-a
http://www.decodeunicode.org/en/latin-1_supplement
)

Explaining both Ŧ/ŧ and Ű/ű

Knowing quite little about languages that actually use most of these accents and how they use them I generally just went with what fontlab gave me and tried to align it to the optical midpoint, fix anything I found aesthetically unpleasing and hint it.

If I find the time and/or motivation for it I'll fix these problems now, but in a few months it'll almost guaranteed to be fixed. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Fontlab sometimes give you misadvice with the accents, so it is better for you to find out how to do it properly. 
The changes I wrote are for few hours. 

Good luck with finishing this project.
