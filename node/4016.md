  body: Anything&#39;s possible, but I guess I&#39;d be surprised if this were a font.
    That P is so distorted it&#39;s almost a D, and I can&#39;t imagine a font with
    that sort of legibility problem would be very useful. I&#39;d guess this is a
    custom designed logo, and whether it was morphed from another font, or created
    new is anyone&#39;s guess.
