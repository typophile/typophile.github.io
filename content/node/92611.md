  Spieghel der Schrijfkonste and came to wonder what it stood for.\r\nIn the examples
  I found the text seems to be introducing something else but I can be wrong.\r\n\r\nAny
  help, references or other examples would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_laajonXPZE1qc9u1ro1_500.jpg\">\r\n<img

    Velde was a master of course\u2026 and his Spieghel was a demo of his proficiency."

    or other kind of emphasis. The same one would do nowadays using italics, bold
    or a different typeface."

  body: Although the illustration shows a right hand, backslanting could also be a
    natural consequence of ledt-handedness. Even if this isn't the case, indicating
    emphasis by slanting doesn't really dictate that the direction of the slant can
    only go one way. Nicolette Larson notes that backslanted foundry type first appeared
    in the 1820s, most likely as a novelty.

  body: "Backslanted original means mirrored form for the engraver, which is regular
    slant and of course favors righthanded craftsmen. The more common slant is of
    course a pain for the same guy\u2026 But these people were exceptionally skilled,
    so\u2026 (Note that intaglio printing requires a mirror image.)"

  body: "Thank you for these indications and leads. In a very short allusion to van
    den Velde in Dutch Type, Middendorp writes that his handwriting had been adapted
    for print by engravers. Both steps are impressive.\r\nShowing off must have been
    an important motivation but I'd be surprized if this very unnatural way of differenciating
    text didn't have another one. Still from Middendorp's short allusion: 'Gerrit
    Noordzij has written that this type of calligraphy is the purest expression of
    the mannerist attitude, which \"creates its own little cosmos amidst the chaos\".
    (Letterletter 14, 1996)'\r\nMy first thought was irony, which I read about some
    time ago but can't remember where, though it's maybe a little early for this.
    Would you know where to look for early/-iest examples of ironic use of backslanted
    lettering?\r\n\r\nNick,\r\nthank you for the reference. If she writes more on
    the subject, do you know where should I look for this text by Nicolette Larson?"
