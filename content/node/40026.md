body: "Looking for suggestions as alternatives to Georgia, for use on da web. I like
  Georgia for body text. But I'm wondering if there are any other serif typefaces
  that, like Georgia, are excellent for body text on screen. \r\n\r\nMy plan would
  be to specify Georgia as a value of my font properties, but also include some unique
  serif typefaces that some folks just might have installed on their system... Just
  for fun.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I assume that if one were to install Vista on one's
  Mac, one would be installing the new Vista typefaces. True?\r\n\r\n"

    Constantia and Cambria are great little faces.\r\n\r\nI certainly wouldn't recommend
    anything like Minion - far too much chance of it looking awful."

  body: IMO, Minion looks fine in Safari on a Mac, which is the environment you'd
    expect to find it installed on, and the user-base who would be inclined to appreciate
    an alternative to Georgia, Palatino and Times.

  body: "I don't know. Minion doesn't look right. I assumed it would look like Minion
    pushed into an environment in which it doesn't feel comfortable. And that's how
    I perceive it. I wonder whether this is because I'm so accustomed to seeing Georgia
    work well, or if I'm just used to seeing Minion on paper.\r\n\r\nThere should
    be more Georgias in the world. I'm curious to see those MS faces in my browser... "
