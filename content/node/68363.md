  body: "Rainer, yeah, I looked at Bonn, but lent towards Typeface-Six because it
    had the right J. I guess Bonn's got the right A though, so it could be both with
    the S taken from a third source?\r\n\r\nLuvtype, the A in Mostra/Mostra Nuova
    doesn't fit, but the S does look the same. The question then is whether this sample
    predates Mostra (2001) which, to my eye, it does. Well, the style does anyway.
    Do you know when the book was produced?"

    the counters of \u2018P\u2019/\u2018R\u2019 and other details are a match."

  body: No. It is a custom typeface for the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik
    Deutschland in Bonn. Neville Brody has also used it in his redesign for the Austrian
    Broadcasting Corporation, ORF. See also the thread Rainer (Renko) has linked to.
