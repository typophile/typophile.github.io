  a talk about his work and type in general, next Tuesday, April 8th. The talk will
  be bilingual (Ja/En), with Q&A and an hour of chit chat and mingling afterwards.
  \r\n\r\nThe talk is presented by Tokyo Art Beat, and will be hosted by myself. \r\n\r\n<a

    lecture.\r\nI'll introduce this info to graphic designers of my friend who might
    be interested in this.\r\nLimited seating of 90. hmm.. I'm worried that I can
    have a seat.\r\n\r\nAnd I've been curious about your activity in AQ. I always
    check your web site.\r\nI hope to see you there, too."

  body: "Thanks to everyone who came out last night! We had a full house despite the
    non-stop rain, and there were a lot of good discussions going on. \r\n\r\nJudging
    by the strong turnout of Japanese type designers and students, I guess this kind
    of type-related event is pretty rare in Tokyo, so I hope we can make more happen
    in the future. \r\n\r\n"

    appreciate all of your help last night. Because you hosted the event, I attend
    it, could listend to his talk and could talk with him (thank you for your interpretation).
    Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this kind of type-related event is very rare
    in Tokyo. I hope there are more events like this in the future.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ChristianSchwartzInTokyo01_5012.jpg]"
