body: "I was trying to use the AFDKO's checkOutlines and AutoHint, but it didn't work
  because the Python version was 2.5 in MacOSX 10.4. I got an error message that \"This
  script supports only Python versions 2.3 and 2.4. The current version is 2.5.\"\r\nSo
  I would like to replace ver.2.5 to ver.2.4 or ver.2.3 but I didn't know how should
  I replace the python program. Or is there any way to solve this problem?"

  body: 'On Windows, you can install multiple versions of Python, and I''m guessing
    the same is true on the Mac. So you may not need to replace v2.5, but might install
    v2.4 alongside it. You can get the v2.4 package for Mac here: http://www.pythonmac.org/packages/'

  body: "> <em>shotype:~ okano$ tx -h\r\n-bash: tx: command not found</em>\r\n\r\nHi
    Kunihiko, try this:\r\n\r\n1. Open a new Terminal window and type <code><strong>pico
    .profile</strong></code>\r\n\r\n2. You should now have the .profile file opened
    in pico, and see some lines that look like this:\r\n<code><strong>PATH=${PATH}:\"/Users/your_username/bin/\"</strong></code>\r\n\r\n3.
    Select those lines, copy them, and close the file (Ctrl+X)\r\n\r\n4. Type <code><strong>pico
    .bash_profile</strong></code>\r\n\r\n5. Paste the lines copied in step 3\r\n\r\n6.
    Close the file (Ctrl+X), answering \"Y\" to save the changes\r\n\r\n7. Close the
    Terminal window\r\n\r\n8. Open a new Terminal window. Typing <code><strong>tx
    -h</strong></code> should now work, as well as all the other AFDKO command line
    tools\r\n\r\nHope this helps."
