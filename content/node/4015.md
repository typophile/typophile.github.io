  confused me though and I was hoping for some help from my dear typophiles. <BR>
  <BR>Almost every single &#39;4&#39; was drawn in this fashion&#40;excuse my sloppy
  modification... but something along the lines of this&#41;: <BR> <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/3228.gif"
  ALT="sloppy four"> <BR> <BR> <BR>Notice the angular cut, I can&#39;t remember seeing
  this in any recent design, or any &#39;traditional&#39; &#40;besides in this very
  specimen book&#41; typeface for that matter either. &#39;Regular&#39; 4&#39;s are
  AFAIK either closed or drawn with a cut that is not angular but horizontal. <BR>
  <BR>Is this still used today, was it popular before, yaddfa yadda... please shed
  some light over my neophyte type knowledge. will ya? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    decent open &#34;4&#34; that can maintain its structure in darker weights. Do
    the specimens include darker weigths? <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Tifanny, yeah... that would be a plausible explanation if there were more
    characters looking like this, but it was limited only to the 4&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Hrant,
    yes, some of them. Quite a few were bold in their original cuts also. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    I&#39;m not negative about it or anything, I was just surprised that it was so
    common. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">
    <BR> <BR>Thanks. '
