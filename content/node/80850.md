body: Obviously this was a custom drawn logo but I'm sure it's based off of something.
  It looks really familiar (without the decorative spurs) and it's killing me. Any
  ideas? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/EverUpward_4687.jpg]

    some of the best western style fonts I've seen. http://letterheadfonts.com/fonts/americanapanels.php

    State Mottos]] project.\r\nHard to say because it has been heavily customized,
    could have been done totally from scratch (try to ask directly to the designer).\r\nI
    don't know any commercial font that could give this final result directly (probably
    some Ps effects applied and a long process to get there).\r\nSome suggestions
    (geometric gothic condensed, /R straight leg and round top /A), in the same vein
    (a lot work needed: possible slanting, manually adding tuscan-style spikes, 3D/shade
    effect, roughing texture): [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/liquorstore/|Liquorstore]],

  body: I know the work of many designers in this project, a lot of them do custom
    type from scratch, this one is probably one of those.

  body: "It's a very cool project and I figured it was a custom illustration. I wasn't
    looking for something that would give me the final result (I lots of stuff like
    this in Photoshop), just some of the basic letter forms. Thanks for all of the
    recommendations though. Some of these I've never heard of before and could be
    pretty useful in the future.\r\n-HL"
