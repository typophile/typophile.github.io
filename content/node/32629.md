  body: "Thanks for the quick response guys. \r\n\r\nIs there a version of Avant Garde
    that has an angled 'M'as well? I saw a font before that was like this and think
    it might be a variation of Avant Garde."

  body: "The font I linked to has all the alternates, but they only show a few in
    the sample. Note also that this is an OpenType font, so you will need Quark 7
    or an Adobe CS app to access them. \r\n\r\nIf that's a problem, there is also
