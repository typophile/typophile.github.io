  a series of releases on the French/UK-based Indie label \u201CBecause.\u201D (Because
  has Klaxxons, Justice, Charlotte Gainsbourg and a bunch of other very interesting
  artists on it\u2019s roster.)\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking to hire a very creative and
  experienced designer to do one and maybe two things for this release. The first
  and most pressing is I need some lettering of my name designed based on a very old
  German hand-painted drawing.  \r\n\r\nAfter that, I might be looking to hire somebody
  to create a font based on the typeface painted into this poster as well.  \r\n\r\nIf
  you are interested, please write for more details.  My email address is fredo@fredoviola.com
  \ and you can see/hear my work on my website:  http://www.fredoviola.com\r\n\r\nThanks!
  \r\n\r\n- Fredo Viola"

    a URL will do it.

    email him if you are interested. I have to assume he doesn't want to share the
    image for inspiration to maintain some level of secrecy. \r\n\r\nTo everyone,
    Fredo emailed me asking where to post this thread. This is legit and sounds like
    a great project for the great talent I know is out there."
