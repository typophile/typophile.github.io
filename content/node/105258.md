  body: Can't find a match either. Firstly thought to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mostardesign/sofia-pro|Sofia]]
    by Mostardesign Olivier Gourvat but /G and /M thrown me off. Then thought to KLIM
    Kris Sowersby [[https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/metric|Metric]] but still /M and
    /S off... May be a custom typeface?

  body: 'I thought it might be custom, but I''d be surprised if it was (in a good
    way). It''s not the usual modern-geo-sans-serif suspects. Not the terminals on
    characters such as the G, W and the equal width upper counter on the S. '
