body: This is a free  design I&#39;m doing for a friend of mine. So, I&#39;ve designed
  this typographic logo for his name and build up the &#34;ci&#34; ligature. Don&#39;t
  really want/can spend more time on this, but let me know what do you think on the
  typography &amp; design in general. It has the Metalic Silver pantone &#43; Pantone
  7427. Which card do you like more? Notice the ENORMOUS email I had to place it on
  the back... <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27457.gif"

  body: Very nice logo. The word spacing in &#34;da costa&#34; feels a little wide.
    <BR> <BR>I definitely prefer the card on the right. The red on the bottom right
    really draws the viewers eye. I can&#39;t quite tell what information is there
    at this size, but I would suggest making it the most important &#40;phone, services
    description, or whatever is the priority info&#41;. If your friend can&#39;t afford
    to pay you, then he might appreciate going with the one color backside. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

  body: I like the right side as well. <BR> <BR>This looks nice, but my one concern
    is the thickness of &#34;carlos felicio&#34;. Beside the fact that I&#39;ve never
    been a fan of Mrs. Eaves bold, I think the red could be enough to stand out on
    that all-white card. <BR> <BR>Good luck!

  body: Thanks Scott &amp; Daniel. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve uploaded a second version of
    the logo without the bold&amp;regular Mr. Eaves and I think it&#39;s more balanced
    &#40;the bold/regular leap is very big on this family&#41;. Also the Costa was
    in fact with lowsy kerning, I&#39;ve changed that also. About the back print of
    the card, just the email or plain white on the red print? Is there a need to repeat
    the logo on the back of the card? I usually do this.. hum. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve replaced
    the info I had on the red block with the tel&amp; fax. Comments are always welcome.

  body: The word spacing &#40;not letter spacing&#41; in &#34;da costa&#34; is still
    a little much compared to the spacing in &#34;carlos felicio&#34;. Even if the
    spacing was the same mathmatically/technically, optically the height of the red
    &#34;f&#34; and the lightness of the silver make it feel more open in comparison.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t necessarily think the logo/title needs to be on the backside
    of the card. In fact, the value of the red as an identifier is stronger without
    the name. In other words, with the presence of the logo/title you focus on the
    company name, but without it you focus on the flooded red color, which might be
    a distinguishing factor in their visual communications &#40;if they do much of
    it&#41;. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: 'Adriano, I have a few questions: Are the business cards going to be on coated
    or uncoated paper and will the paper have a texture? If its on uncoated paper
    you might want to loose the full bleed red back especially if there is a texture
    to the stock. You can have the best typography in the world and it can be ruined
    on press.  <BR> <BR>One other thought is Red reminds me of Stop Signs, especially
    with Knock Out type. Red also signals danger.'

    it&#39;s wise to loose the back red. This color was my first thought but tell
    me which color do you think matches this lawyer market, I&#39;ll only present
    this card tomorrow to the client. Thanks again.

  body: 'Verrrry beautiful, although I&#39;m not sure about the MetaDesign-esque rectangular
    at the bottom, it has a kind of 80s feeling that doesn&#39;t really mesh with
    the rest. Other than that, ligatures and everything.. nice and solid for a lawyer.  <BR>I
    like the red, btw. It fits the PMS877 and isaggressive, which I&#39;d personally
    say is a GOOD quality in a lawyer &#40;as long as he is on your side&#41;. Blue
    is such a standard colour for advocats, as is dark green. Red is it, if you ask
    me. The first feeling is often the right one. If you know the guy -- is he more
    agressive or more a laid back person? if the former, go ahead with red. Maybe
    you can use a bit of a darker tone to mellow it a bit, if need be.  <BR> <BR>Uncoated
    paper with such a full bleed CAN work, if the prrinter knows what he does and
    the type isn&#39;t too small. Imo, the subtle inclusions and structures in the
    paper, the small imperfections ARE what makes it work in that case.  <BR> <BR>The
    right hand card in the first example has such a nice red background and the type
    is neat, if it technically is workable, you should use that, with a motto or something.  <BR>
    <BR>Btw, the only thinhg I don&#39;t like is the arrangement of the type on the
    card-front. It looks much nicer on the back in the left-hand example, more symmetric
    and in-the-middle, a better use of proportion and white-space. '

  body: '&#40;1&#41; The left version &#40;top image&#41; is preferrable. The red
    across the bottom acts as a solid base. It also allows the assymetry of the name
    and info to stand out more. Also, the gray on the back &#40;in the red&#41; is
    almost the same tone and so is disappearing &#40;at least on my monitor&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;2&#41; You should as your rep at the press if the price might be
    similar if you printed the job as work-and-turn, that is if you want to keep the
    red on the back. <BR> <BR>&#40;3&#41; Should the vertical line separating the
    name and company be centered with the x-height instead? <BR> <BR>&#40;4&#41; Should
    the letter spacing of &#34;da costa&#34; be wider? The st ligature you are using

    and the small x-height. The serifs seem so much more than just serifs, almost
    a design element in and of themselves.

    to 0,6 &#40;0,75 was too much&#41;. Made the font a little bigger for the text.
