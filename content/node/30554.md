body: "Hi there,\r\nI've made a font for a client and have no idea how to license
  it for them. I've read many bits and pieces but don't seem to be able to find anything
  specific. Does anyone have any handy links or suggestions?"

  body: 'Often the way a license works is that that you give tem exclusive use of
    it for x # of years after which you may license it to someone else or offer it
    on the retail market for non exclusive use. Exclusive use costs more that retail.
    MUCH more. What the price of exclusivity is will depend on the value the client
    sees in it. Anyway that''s the normal thing. Obviously you or they may want other
    terms and so it''s up to you. Want to show the font to us?'

  body: Thanks for that. At the moment they're wanting full ownership of the font,
    so I guess from my side I won't have to worry about licensing.

  body: "Perpetual exclusivity is a tricky one. You'll naturally raise the price,
    but how does one calculate potential (lost) retail sales for the life of the font
    against the size of the company? Maybe a supplemental annual royalty would be
    in order, but full ownership implies they would want to avoid that hassle.\r\n\r\nAt
    least include a clause that rights to the font revert back to you should it be
    removed from their corporate design system or otherwise fall into disuse after
    a period of time. They might not go for that either, but it's worth asking for."

  body: "When I license files...they are all 'single-end user' agreements.  It would
    be impossible for anything I've made previously to suddenly have restrictions
    put on it. (Yes, people have actually asked me if I could 'do that for them.'
    All of my are free for personal and classroom use - the ones that are currently
    on the site.  The files that I custom make I title in a completely different way
    than I do my normal files AND in the copyright line I list myself as the author
    but I denote copyright to the person/company who has paid me for the work.  I
    include 'the prize' as my attorney's call it (proven QUITE useful in the past)
    by hiding keystrokes, making special keystrokes, specific quirks, etc., known
    only to me and the client. I even have it mentioned that all original files may
    be destroyed at the 'new owners' request - although no one has asked me to do
    that as of yet.  If a custom file gets out in the public domain, I didn't have
    anything to do with it.  It's a matter of ethics.  I couldn't do that to someone
    seeing how I know EXACTLY how it feels to have work taken from you.  I've dealt
    with this issue in the past and I'm dealing with it right now too, sadly.  Lastly,
    registered owners get all formats of the file.  I only offer .ttf's on my site.

  body: Thanks for all of your comments, they have been extremely useful. I have allowed
    the company exclusivity with a clause that lets ownership revert to me if they
    cease to use the font as their id. Thanks cuttlefish for that handy hint. Luckily
    the client agreed with it.
