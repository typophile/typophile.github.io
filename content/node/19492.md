body: "hello\r\n\r\nim looking for a pdf-specimen of FF Bau (with the g of ff bau
  super!). im working on a fun-project, just got a few letters done of an extra-bold
  grotesque. i dont want to copy ff bau, but i know that i want a 2-story-g and i
  wanted to have a close look at FF bau for that one - im not that experienced, thus
  this could be a good help.\r\n\r\nbut i cant find it on orangeitalic or the FS-homepage.
  any help?"

  body: Usability? Can you explain? I searched for FF Bau, clicked on the Super weight,
    typed a 'g' in the sample field and selected 388 pts. Would love to hear how that
    could be easier.

    type \"FF bau\" in the search form\r\n4. click on FF bau\r\n5. land on a (unlinkable)
    page with flash-content where i cannot find a link to bigger glyph versions or
    a textfield where i can select a typesize..\r\n\r\noh now.. fontshop.com is SO
    much better than fontshop.de. so yes, it is very easy to find on fontshop.com.
    should've tried it there."
