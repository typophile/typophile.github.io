  outlined a font I used for a logo in my design class before writing down the font
  name. The font is no where to be found in my downloads or computer so I'm at a loss
  here. I've searched the sites I used for this font and simply cannot find it. Could
  someone please tell me if they know what this font is? I have only included the
  bit at the beginning because the O is one of the hallmarks of the font. Thank you!\r\n
