  body: That's a really terrible article, even by the usual low standards of archaeology-related
    journalism. You have to be very careful when talking to journalists, because they'll
    misinterpret anything they possibly can, and pick up on random throwaway remarks
    and spin them into major points. And it doesn't help that this one doesn't seem
    to have gone to any other expert on the topic to get perspective, comment, etc.

    because computers are only shaped like domes in bad science-fiction, and front-panel
    lights are out in the computer world today.\r\n\r\nBut it wasn't a monster computer
    that deciphered the language; it was a specialized camera that captured elusive
    features of the relief inscriptions.\r\n\r\nSo there's nothing in the article
    to set off any alarm bells.\r\n\r\nThe other link in this thread, though, essentially
    says that proto-Elamite inscriptions are understood, but they aren't really representative
    of an actual language - pictures of things accompanied by a count of how many
    are being receipted for. So that does make me suspicious."

  body: "These are just my opinions, and I'm not an expert, but here are some things
    in the article that seemed a bit off. \r\n\r\n<blockquote>Breakthrough in world's
    oldest undeciphered writing</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe headline is misleading, even
    in relation to the article itself. As the body of the article makes clear, there
    hasn't been a breakthrough; rather, there has been a pile of money spent on an
    imaging system that the researcher hopes may lead to a breakthrough (cf. [[http://www.ashmolean.org/departments/antiquities/research/research/rtisad/]].
    If you read more closely, the only real announcement here is that the main group
    of tablets in Paris will be imaged and then these images will be put online. This
    is nice and undoubtedly useful, but hardly amazing \u2013 they've been published
    on paper, albeit long ago and not up to modern standards. Whether it leads to
    any breakthrough remains to be seen. But apart from the device itself, there's
    very little here that couldn't have been said ten years ago: [[http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P183.PDF]]\r\n\r\n<blockquote>So
    far Dr Dahl has deciphered 1,200 separate signs</blockquote>\r\n\r\nUm, no. I'm
    sure he didn't say that. He has been updating Meriggi's catalogue listing all
    the distinct signs used in Proto-Elamite script, of which there are about 1000
    to 1200 in all. Some of these have been understood for quite a while; many more
    remain obscure.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>This first case of educational underinvestment
    proved fatal for the writing system, which was corrupted and then completely disappeared
    after only a couple of hundred years.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis part is a little
    bizarre, but I'm not sure whether it was the journalist or Dahl spinning an observation
    about glyph variation a little too far. The system appears to be less standardized
    than proto-cuneiform, which itself shows quite a bit of instability, but people
    weren't writing these tablets for fun. They're basically bookkeeping detritus.
    The script was used for several generations over a large area because it was useful,
    and if there were problems of consistency, people generally react to that by simplifying
    or standardizing. With proto-cuneiform, between 3100 and 2700 they simplified,
    standardized, and \"syntacticized\" (made the writing system correspond more to
    spoken language). If proto-Elamite writers instead abandoned the system \u2013
    which is not certain, because there is a hypothesis that the Linear Elamite script
    is a radically simplified descendant of proto-Elamite \u2013 it would suggest
    that the whole notion of writing in general ceased to be needed for a while, which
    does happen now and then.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Making it even harder to decode is
    the fact that it's unlike any other ancient writing style. There are no bi-lingual
    texts and few helpful overlaps to provide a key to these otherwise arbitrary looking
    dashes and circles and symbols.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt's not very different from
    proto-cuneiform, except for the key difference that proto-cuneiform has a well-understood
    descendant script. The relationship with proto-cuneiform numerals has been very
    useful for figuring out what is known of proto-Elamite, actually. There are ancient
    scripts with much worse problems of lack of bilinguals and short texts that provide
    little to work with, such as Linear A and Harappan.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>This is
    a writing system - and not a spoken language - so there's no way of knowing how
    words sounded, which might have provided some phonetic clues.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis
    appears to have been badly garbled somehow. I think the point being made probably
    had something to do with how proto-Elamite script, apart from the possible syllabic
    uses that Dahl thinks he can identify, appears to be entirely logographic, so
    there's no phonetic structure to provide clues to meaning. (Not that phonetic
    clues would help much unless the language were closely related to later Elamite
    or something else that can be read.) \r\n\r\n<blockquote>But infuriatingly for
    the codebreakers, when these proto-Elamites borrowed the concept of writing from
    the Mesopotamians, they made up an entirely different set of symbols.\r\n\r\nWhy
    they should make the intellectual leap to embrace writing and then at the same
    time re-invent it in a different local form remains a puzzle. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSort
    of, not exactly. It looks like what happened is that the numeral system, which
    had some limited semantics about what was being counted embedded in it, developed
    first, in Mesopotamia. The proto-Elamite script borrowed this, but it looks like
    both Mesopotamia and western Iran developed this into something more like a writing
    system in parallel, using some similar elements but mostly independently. The
    numeral system appears to have been borrowed at a time fairly early in the process
    of developing a fuller proto-cuneiform writing system.\r\n\r\nEgypt appears to
    be a more puzzling case of borrowing the idea but reinventing the entire system,
    unless Egyptian script is older than currently known.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>It's
    possible to work out the rations given to these farm labourers.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nYes,
    with some reservations given that so much of the informational content remains
    unclear. However, what isn't known is the relationship between the portion of
    the economy that was recorded on tablets and the portion that was not. The society
    was undoubtedly quite unequal, but it is not known whether these are fully dependent
    laborers receiving all of their food from a bureaucratic system or temporary corv\xE9e
    laborers being paid (poorly) in kind, or more likely some mixture."

    body: 'Proto-Elamite seems unrelated to Linear Elamite, and it is quite possible
      that the term is a misnomer. There also tends to be a bias against the idea
      that Susa was crucial to the development of writing (if not a bias against the
      idea, that Susa was just a colony of Uruk).  As you mention writing may have
      evolved in parallel through Mesopotamia.  Proto-Elamite dates to only 100 years
      after Sumerian. Such a difference is close enough to be explained by contamination,
      or limited sampling. And it is difficult to understand, as this article points
      out, why a civilization (Susa) would not just adopt the Sumerian script, and
      decide to re-invent writing, so to speak. For that reason alone, it may be more
      likely that the development of writing occured in Susa, and at some early phase
      of it''s development, the ideographical form of writing made it''s way to Sumer.
      We have evidence for the development of writing in Susa: The earliest proto-elamite
      is ideagraphical, and almost immediately afterwards, appears to take a more
      syllabic form. One would expect if the relationship was reverse, if writing
      was invented in ''Sumer'' (assuming Susa wasn''t part of Sumer), than the transition
      to syllabic form would not occur so shortly afterwards - especially among a
      random, preliterate, population. But if we assume that Susanian''s were experimenting
      with writing, than the transition can be explained a lot easier. It is also
      important to note that the oldest counting tokens and cylindrical seals to date,
      which were crucial to the development of writing, were found at Susa.'

    the \"corruption\" of the script, I'm guessing it was used mostly internally,
    so people just did their own thing deviating from whatever pseudo-standard there
    was. But I'm not sure this would have contributed to its disappearance because
    there was probably no great need to share those documents anyway.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    by only two people, the writer and a known recipient. That kind of system can
    tolerate a lot of idiosyncratic variation.\r\n\r\nAnd just to add a more typographic
    element to the thread, Denise Schmandt-Besserat has argued that the numeral system
    that formed the original core of both proto-cuneiform and proto-Elamite originated
    from pressing counting tokens into clay. For example, you would indicate \"4 sheep\"
    by pressing a \"sheep\" token into the clay four times. If conveying written information
    by stamping an object repeatedly counts as typography in some very general sense,
    you could then argue that writing is derived from typography just as much as the
    other way around :)"

  body: 'It''s also worth noting that it is completely misleading, if not completely
    wrong, to say that lowland Iran (in addition to Susa), is not generally considered
    part of Mesopotamia. The ongoing perception among scholars is that because Western
    Iran was in the sphere of influence of Ubaid culture (which lead to the Sumerian
    civilization), it just an extension of Mesopotamia (See: Beyond the Ubaid, http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc63.pdf).'

  body: Although Mesopotamia means 'between the rivers', it refers to entire river
    system and its valleys, which formed an agricultural region. I presume Zada's
    'lowland Iran' refers to the area to the southwest of the Zagros mountains and
    to the Iranian river systems that feed into the lower Mesopotamian system. The
    area of southwestern Iran around Ahvaz is geographically within the broader Mesopotamian
    region.
