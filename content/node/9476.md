body: If a typeface designed for 10 pt size is used at 12,5 pt size, the correct tracking
  setting in Indesign is -25. Could this be right?

  body: That doesn&#39;t sound right to me. I would think that the tracking wouldn&#39;t
    need to change that much for such a small size increase. Generally, unless I move
    from text size to headline/subhead size, I do not decrease the tracking at all.
    <BR> <BR>However, below 8pt, I usually add a little, to open it up a bit.

  body: 'I guess you never really know Intent... And the type&#39;s designer might
    even not! Or he could be off. So it might be better to consider something like
    &#34;optimal&#34; size for a given font. Which would however depend on other things
    too, like line length... <BR> <BR>You could get a grasp of a font&#39;s optimal
    size &#34;deterministically&#34;, by actually setting a paragraph at different
    sizes and deciding which looks best; or you could do it &#34;mathematically&#34;,
    by looking at the glyphs: their proportions, color, spacing, etc. The former method
    is more subjective, the latter more prone to being way off. The good news is that
    a font will work well at more than just one single point size, so you&#39;re really
    just looking for a ballpark number. <BR> <BR>And yes, InDesign&#39;s optical spacing
    over-rides all  -or almost all- the designer&#39;s spacing decisions. But I&#39;ve
    found that its results end up better almost all the time. Don&#39;t use it on
    fonts by Carter for example &#40;unless you&#39;re deviating greatly from the
    ideal size range&#41;, but do use it on your average digital font. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: I wouldn&#39;t recommend using &#34;optical spacing&#34; on traditional serifed
    faces. It upsets their rhythm. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s much better with sans serifs.

  body: 'I was experimenting with FF Clifford Nine, and I assumed that it is intended
    for 9 pt size. I ended up &#40;?&#41; with the following setup: Clifford Eighteen
    &#40;intended for big sizes&#41; in 12 on 15 pt size and Plus 10 tracking. Optical
    scaling looked looked awful. I returned quickly back to metric scaling. <BR> <BR>By
    the way, does anyone know a good Jannon typeface which is somewhat heavier than
    Monotype Garamond? Not Abobe Garamond.'

  body: '&#62;how do you know what is the intended size for the face? <BR> <BR>When
    a foundry indicates, by the name of a typeface, a specific size which it will
    look good at, the typographer should approach that as a &#34;ball-park&#34; suggestion,
    ie with a lot of leeway, open to personal interpretation, and dependent on the
    particular circumstances of the job it will be used for. <BR> <BR>If I am producing
    size-adapted variants in a typeface, I&#39;ll distinguish them by broadly descriptive
    names such as Headline or Fine. <BR> <BR>The biggest difficulty for the typographer
    is, as Aku has noticed, at the intermediate size between display sizes and basic
    text, ie 12-18 ish, and there you really have to experiment and use your powers
    of discrimination to figure out the best setting.'
