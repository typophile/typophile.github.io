  body: You're probably right Lex - I don't have Univers extended for some reason
    so I didn't see it.

    or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Fineprint">Fineprint</a>
    for "Northern Beaches".

  body: Kate - I looked as Sabon too before making the idea but it doesn't match -
    see the cap S (no serifs) and the top serif on the "l". It looks like Bembo to
    me.

  body: The script matches a font called Liliput (Brendel Informatik) but I can't
    find much detail about it, so probably a copy of something else.
