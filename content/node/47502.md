  body: "Isn't it odd how often Rosewood Fill shows up, especially without its counterpart
    (Rosewood Regular)? Not that Rosewood Regular is usable for most jobs, but I would
    think any decent Clarendon face would be better than the over-spaced Rosewood
    Fill.\r\n\r\nBTW, I just stumbled over it again in Disney's CAMP ROCK logo...
    with Tiki Island!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    was never meant to be used as a typeface on its own. Doing so was a Carsonish
    kinda thing to do. And that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s just lame to <em> still</em>
    do it."

  body: There seems to have been a hiccup, Erin -- you posted the same identification
    request <a href="http://typophile.com/node/47503">twice</a> (see Florian's second
    comment).

    help ... I do now remember that it's Rosewood.\r\nand when I said I've seen it
    lately -- that's just because it's come up a lot while I've perused the web, coroflot,
    etc. (prompting this post)\r\nI believe starbucks has used it as well.\r\n\r\n:)"
