  body: "Stewf is right -- Mousse has a g without the looped tail as well as the more
    open p (Glengary's is more closed). Those had made me a little suspect, and now
    I know why. (I thought maybe the designer had customized it.)\r\n\r\nAlso: I'd
    pay for an Alejandro Paul face over the competition any day of the week."

    other version. (Or is this rub Nick's nose in it day?)

  body: "Nick - A fair question. I admit I am making a judgment of Glengary from onscreen
    samples alone, but here is what I can conclude: while the sheer number of fonts
    you release in a given month is impressive, the volume doesn't bode well for their
    quality. \r\n\r\nI <em>do</em> have personal experience with Paul's fonts -- Mousse
    Script in particular -- and I can confirm that their outlines and metrics are
    sound. Thus the recommendation. But I certainly urge you to demonstrate your work.
    I'd be happy to know there are too fine digital versions of Glenmoy."

  body: "FYI...\r\n\r\nI have been a commercial artist for forty years, and I have
    been a digital artist for seventeen years. Over the course of those years, I have
    developed speedy work habits, despite the fact that all of my outlines are created
    from scratch -- no sloppy scan-and-convert jobs. Additionally, I check the integrity
    of my outlines in Fontographer, DTL Fontmaster and FontLab Studio. I set metrics
    by comparing <strong>every possible combination</strong> of uppercase+uppercase,
    uppercase+lowercase and lowercase+lowercase, and occasionally adjust letterforms
    on the fly if I find problemmatic combinations. I also kern <strong>every possible
    combination</strong> of uppercase+uppercase, uppercase+lowercase and lowercase+lowercase,
    so even words like <strong>Ljubjana, Kwanzaa</strong> and <strong>syzygy</strong>
    look good. I might also mention that making fonts is now my full-time job, and
    the sole means of support for my wife and I. I put in long hours and work every
    day of the week. So, please do not make \"recommendations\" based on unfounded
    assumptions and/or vague notions.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the subject of revivals:
    while I try to capture faithfully the original type designer's letterforms, occasionally
    I do not personally agree with some of the choices the original designer made,
    and I exercise my own judgment and make modifications to those letterforms as
    I see fit. If you don't agree with my choices, that's certainly your prerogative;
    but to call them \"suspect\" is a scurrilous and specious slam.\r\n\r\nBelow are,
    in no particular order, a scan from a broadside specimen sheet from Stephenson
    Blake of Glenmoy, the same characters in Glengary and the same characters in Mousse
    Script. Who wants to identify which is which (without checking outside sources)?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/glengary-glenmoy-mousse_5484.gif]"

  body: "Nick, I apologize for being hasty in judging your work. I am afraid I let
    the past (such as Creampuff) influence my perspective. I commend you on your work
    practices. They sound well-founded. Still, they cannot take the place of careful
    drawing and skillful (re)interpretation of the original work.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    the comparison graphic. Though it might be more useful if we saw upper/lowercase
    words since those combos and their connections are vital in judging the quality
    in this face.\r\n\r\nLet's also not forget that Mousse Script comes with a set
    of alternates that enhance the value of the package."

  body: 'I actually prefer how Nick has digitized it. He has kept to the original
    and the original has a crispness which Mousse lacks. Mousse is like the subtitle
    and Glengary is the display. Mousse is nice, but some of the changes made to it
    depart from the original in ways that I''m not sure I like. '

    the broadside specimen sheet was simply an alphabetic display, so -- in order

    sorry for the confusion.\r\n\r\nAs for my side note, it wasn't a slam against
    Nick specifically -- it was more that if Alejandro Paul went head-to-head against
    <em>anyone</em>, I'd most likely choose his. What can I say? I adore the man's
    work."

    sure your solution works, and it looks like your 'x' has a broken connection,
