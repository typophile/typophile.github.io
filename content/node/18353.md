  body: I agree. I may have something to show yet, but it's tricky. I never realized
    how unrelated Hobo is to handwriting, which of course is the basis for scripts.
    If anybody comes up with a decent solution, it's going to be very interesting.

  body: I know, eight characters. I realized this after I posted. I've never been
    a good one for following directions. Hobo has a lot of brushish tendencies, which
    translate well to scripts. There are a lot of really cool things about Hobo that
    I never noticed before. The sharp terminals on the uc S and lc c for example are
    super cool.

    don't lend themselves to \"scriptifying\" - the two-storey 'a', the on-the-baseline

    the computer, but threw it away as it was crap! (Blast my left-handed \"dyscalligraphia\"?!)\r\n\r\nAfter

    I agree, Mark. Hobo is a total mess. In some ways it reminds me of the meandering
    curves of Art nouveau, without any of the elegance.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bummer.gif]\r\n\r\nWell, haven't participated
    in previous battles but this one interested me and I decided to do a proof of
    concept . . . My approach was far more minimal than most of what was presented
    so far in that I wanted to accomplish a script 'feeling' with the least amount
    of modification to the face so if they were presented in tandem folks would know
    one was the script and one was the base weight . . .\r\n\r\nThe other thing I
    noticed as with other script faces I've developed is that not EVERYTHING needs
    to connect in order for it to be a script style. This is certianly true of trying
    to make the Hobo CAPS connect where there isn't a natural 'tail' . . .\r\n\r\nBeyond
    that, things like the 'er' combination I felt had nice flow so what would be gained
    with a formal connection between them? Functionally the idea of a script in my
    mind is to present a comfortable eye flow rather make everything touch . . . \r\n\r\nNot
    the most exciting submission but I feel it appropriately accomplishes the challenge
    . . .\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStuart :D"
