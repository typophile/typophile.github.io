  posting here. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to identify a font that occours in a desktop
  wallpaper image. A copy of which is located here: <BR><a href="http://www.zlaga.ru/f/b/celebrities_1221_Zlaga_ru.jpg"
  target="_blank">http://www.zlaga.ru/f/b/celebrities_1221_Zlaga_ru.jpg</a> <BR> <BR>[Warning!:
  probobly work safe, but &#42;does&#42; contain an image of an attractive girl in
  a bikini] <BR> <BR>If you can look past the obvious above-noted distraction, you&#39;ll
  see the font of interest marking her name in the lower left-hand corner. ;-&#41;
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tried using a couple of the &#39;auto web font identifiers&#39;
  &#40;on an appropraitely cropped version of the image&#41; but to no avail, so I
  thought I&#39;d try here. <BR> <BR>If you know, that&#39;d be great!  <BR>Cheers'

    Script</a>, which would explain why your other attempts didn&#39;t pan out.

  body: 'Thanks Dave, you seem to be quite right. And the bolding proboly does explain
    the lack of auto-recognition. The cheshire grins are on me! :-&#41; <BR> <BR>
    <BR> <BR>Yves:  <BR>Well, the background&#39;s definately rendered, But I don&#39;t
    think Fiona is &#40;...though &#39;Mouse&#39; from the Matrix might disagree with
    me! ;-p &#41;  <BR> <BR>She does though, to appear to have suffered some from
    the Agent Smith &#39;airbrush virus&#39; currently rampant in almost every magazine
    nowadays...  :-|  <BR>But, personally I feel her beauty to be genuinly great,
    &#40;i.e. <a href="http://www.rogermanagement.com.au/large/003786.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.rogermanagement.com.au/large/003786.jpg</a>&#41;
    however, naturally in any such personal matter of taste, YMMV.'
