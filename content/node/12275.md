  this but its got a big fat beta tag on it, so if anyone can redirect me to another
  thread I would be very greatful.\r\nAnyway to the point, I stumbled accross this
  forum whilst on a research mission, I'm not really struggling (at the moment) with
  inspiration but more I'm interested to see what kind of things that you guys do
  for inspiration and how you hone down your design processes. I know that certain
  studios have like 'chill out areas' and things so you can go and think or be inspired
  and what not. So I beg the question... What sort of things do you guys use/had/have/need...etc.
  for inspiration?\r\nCheers  =P"
