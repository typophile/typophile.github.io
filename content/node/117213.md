  body: "1979, the photo-lettering era. I'm not certain if this one is digitized.\r\nI'ts
    a variation of Fette Fraktur first cut by Weber in 1875 http://www.myfonts.com/search/fette+fraktur/fonts/
    \r\nThere are significant differences in some capitals, less so in the lower case.
    \r\nThe _S_ might be an enlarged _s_. \r\nIf this was not a photo-lettering era
    redesign, a match might be found Gerhard Helzel's collection http://www.fraktur.biz/\r\nAnd
    it's interesting to explore the Blackletter Revival at Moorstation at http://moorstation.org/typoasis/blackletter/\r\nI
    would be interested in what our fraktur experts have to say.\r\nDon"

  body: Hi, thanks for the reply - agree it looks like Fette Fraktur but it looks
    like a black weight and I agree it looks like they enlarged the lowercase s for
    cap S.

  body: "See Ralph Unger's version of <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rmu/haenel-fraktur/'
    target='_blank'>Haenel Fraktur</a>. Your lowercase 's' is in the number sign position
    and the 'k' is a tz ligature offered in the character set.\r\n\r\nNote that if
    this was done with photolettering, they had all sorts of tricks to optically alter
    film fonts (wider, bolder)."

  body: "Good find Mike. If you widen Haenel Fraktur most of the letters match. _S_
    is indeed an enlarged _s_. _A_ is reworked to make it more readable as a Latinate
    form and _H_ is also a reworked _A_.  I expect that other capital letters not
    in the label were also reworked to make them more readable as Latinate forms.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks, Don. Widening alone won't do the trick, as the counters end up too
    large (I tried it). Stretching <em>and</em> adding a slight stroke does get it
    very close.

  body: "Mike, this shows that some effort was put into making a new font from the
    original Haenel Fraktur model.\r\nAs you know the photo-lettering companies had
    very creative designers who completely redrew classic designs. Then the photo
    part came in to create the variations. But I still have no idea whether this redesign
    was done in that era or many years earlier. Also I would love to see a complete
    alphabet.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"

    I spotted Fette Haenel Fraktur (not with that name) was roughly 3/5 of the way
    down (no page #s) - and that was an outlined/shaded showing of a few words only.\r\n\r\nInteresting
    viewing, nevertheless."

  body: "Mike, this is a fascinating book showing a huge variety of typefaces from
    \ around 1840 to 1850. I recognize a few as being digitized. As was the practice
    of the era almost none have names. Only stock numbers. Even different sizes of
    the same typeface have different numbers. Not certain if this is the one you are
    referring to, but I selected it because of the elaborate encrusted ornamentation
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/MusirteFrakturen3@HaenelEnhanced_5905.jpg]
    BTW, This was one of the clearest images in the book. I tinkered with it to enhance
    it's clarity. I wish Google had paid some attention to the quality of its scans.
    They are appalling, particularly when compared to the ones done by University
    of California & University of Toronto and shown at Archive.org.\r\nDon"

    when its label reads ...\r\n\r\nZierschrift\r\nNo 64\r\n\r\n... Zierschrift isn't
    part of the name? If not, I guess it just means \"ornamental writing\" (as Google
    translates it).\r\n\r\nAs an aside - Insert Image works for me <em>maybe</em>
    once in twenty tries, whether using IE or Chrome. VERY frustrating. Does anyone
    else have that problem?"

  body: "Yes \"zeir\" merely means fancy or ornamented and can be applied to any font.
    \"Shrift\" is correctly translated by Google. You will note similar terms such
    as \"zeirfraktur\" which is a compound with an obvious meaning.\r\nInsert image
    works fine for me in Firefox. Using jpg with standard file names, e.g. ones that
    do not include _&_. \r\nDon"

    if Virgin released any other CD's circa 1979 with the same version? If so, another
    Virgin CD might show some more \"new and improved\" letters.\r\nDon"

  body: I have a copy of the original 1979 album, but presently not to hand as it's
    in storage. I remember the sleeve was with-drawn or banned fairly soon after it's
    release as it was considered Fascist imagery (and replaced with an alternative
    design). It won't be Photo-Lettering  Inc. as it was designed in the UK but it
    is probably photo-set by one of headline setters that were around in London at
    that time.

    out of the mold and got slapped down. in 1979.  Very sad.\r\nPerhaps today it
    would be accepted as a statement of Los Angeles Street scene or hip Biker Style.
