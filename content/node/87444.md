body: "Hi everyone\r\n\r\nI am designing a logo for a marketing company. The two partners
  have differing styles and I am finding it hard to find a typeface that they both
  like.\r\n\r\nOne partner likes bold and slightly quirky. She really liked Appetite.
  The other partner is minimalist and clean, and likes Sodermalm. As you can see,
  they have quite differing tastes. They are willing to meet in the middle. I tried
  Mrs Eaves but they are not convinced.\r\n\r\nI have been staring at typefaces for
  hours! Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n"

    typographical, simple, not fussy, fairly gender neutral to appeal to the masses. '

  body: I assume you are talking about font names there? Maybe a [[http://typophile.com/node/51372|brushy
    serif]]? Maybe something like [[http://www.underware.nl/fonts/dolly/preface/|Dolly]]?

  body: "Looks like you're correct. Likely these two: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/skyback/sodermalm/|S\xF6dermalm]]
    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/deniserebryakov/appetite/|Appetite]].\r\n\r\nWould
    they go with a Modern or a Century serif? Here are some: [[http://www.thessalonica.org.ru/en/fonts.html]]"

  body: "Come to think of it... why not see if you can play S\xF6dermalm and Appetite
    (or others similar to them) against each other. Say, imply chaos meeting order
    and creating new, fresh solutions. Just don't make it a new, clear future... leave
    that to pTerry."
