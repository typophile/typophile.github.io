  body: my guess would be custom/hand-drawn/pen-scrawl as the e and the G are different
    in each occurance..

  body: Actually, Random, no, the e's are exactly the same.  As are the "o" characters,
    and the G's and L's are most definitely the capital and lowercase variants of
    the letters.  This looks like it is a font to me.

  body: That'll learn me to guess! I must not have looked closely enough, though the
    second e seemed to lack a bit of a corner on the lower left.  anyone else?

  body: Random, I think the slight variations you see may be due to the quality of
    the printing and the enlargement. But it would be nice to see more characters.

  body: Patricia -- I think you're probably right, and i see that in retrospect.  Hmm.
    I'm starting to wish the edit/delete post functionality was still in place!

  body: Call me crazy, but it appears to me to be hand-scrawling combined with Letter
    Gothic.
