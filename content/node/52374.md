    be able to identify the typeface in your sample.'

    designed by Radim Pesko so I would expect that the type is custom.

    for\r\nSecession identity which was developed together with Willi Schmid,\r\nin
    2007-2008. Its appearence is inspired by an old prints from\r\nVienna of late
    19th century. Even it is not re-drawn typeface,\r\nits shape it true to the spirit
    to its example.\r\nLarish will be completed with italic released in Spring 2009.\"\r\n\r\n-
