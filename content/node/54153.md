  body: "Hi Carlos, thank you for the mail. I'm no expert, but I think it's an interesting
    take on what is an unusual source. I understand the spaces on the a, b and e which
    you've chosen not to join, following the example of bauhaus, but I'm thinking
    that it would really make it easier to read if they were joined.\r\n\r\nAre you
    thinking of making other weights? I would really like to see a light version of
    this..."

    such a fabulous revival and reinterpretation of 'Bauhaus'. Adding a much needed
    human and handcrafted touch to the geometric constructed 'original'. Sooo smooth.
    Like the cute, little sister of the 'Bauhaus' bully. ;)"

  body: I find that pretty interesting, but one letter bugs me. I think is the way
    you choose to draw the a. Did you try to design a double storey a. I wonder if
    it would be nice to have that type of a.I also notice your caps (F) seems higher
    than the lower case. Is that the way you choose. I would try increase the stem
    of the lower case or decrease the caps.  Keep going.

  body: "Hello, Carlos-\r\n\r\nIn all, that's a great take on a Bauhaus, and a very
    good execution of that idea. There are a couple of things that catched my eye:
    the arm of the 'r' looks a bit thin, so I would fatten that up. And I would also
    fatten the open connection of 'a', 'b' and 'e' etc.; I like that you kept that
    feature of Bauhaus, but in Bauhaus that open part is on a straight line, yours
    is rounded, so I would compensate that with fattening those parts to enhance the
    readability.\r\n\r\nBut in all, a great typeface."

  body: It's really coming together nicely. The script looks a little "choppy" but
    otherwise it's fine. Maybe work on the "s"? and a non swash-y "g"?

  body: "Fabian, since you asked personally for comments, here we go ;-)\r\n\r\nI
    am looking at the PDF from 7th of february, in case you already corrected anything.\r\n\r\nUPPERCASE\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Left stem on A feels a little thick, compare it to a straight stem, the goal is
    to make them look equally thick, or if you are using the contrast method (like
    serif fonts) when two diagonal stems are in the same letters (like A, V, W) you
    should have a system for this. Normally the right stem is a little thicker on
    A in that case (as from the broadpen), and opposite on V, W.\r\n\r\n\u2022 W is
    a litte bit thick in the middle part, it needs more white space there.\r\n\r\n\u2022
    T is higher than S \u2013\_perhaps it has jumped up a little bit?\r\n\r\n\u2022
    B \u2013\_perhaps it could be a little less wide?\r\n\r\n\u2022 M \u2013 I think
    I would try to make the vertical stems a little bit thinner, just to see if it
    is better or not.\r\n\r\n\u2022 N \u2013 same as M\r\n\r\n\u2022 X and Y \u2013
    if you compare the left diagonal stems you'lll see that Y is thicker, they should
    have the same visual thickness I think.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Tail on R \u2013 a little
    to heavy, I believe.\r\n\r\nLOWERCASE\r\nw \u2013 same problems as W (use same
    system also for all glyphs with diagonal stems). Maybe it is a little to wide
    aswell?\r\n\r\nk \u2013 tail to heavy\r\n\r\nj & g \u2013 perhaps a little to
    heavy tails\r\n\r\ne \u2013 perhaps this e should be a stylistic alternate and
    a closed one as default?\r\n\r\nz - to heavy diagonal\r\n\r\nt \u2013 a little
    to high ascender\r\n\r\nx \u2013 feels to thick\r\n\r\ns \u2013 the lowercase
    have another touch than the uppercase S -\_I think you should make them similar.\r\n\r\nc
    - a little wide and too squarish? could be narrower\r\n\r\nm \u2013 a little wide,
    could be narrower?\r\n\r\nOTHER\r\n\r\nperiod \u2013 feels a little weak, comma
    is better\r\n\r\nGenerally the spacing looks a little bit strange (especially
    on the lowercase), try to have as few values as possible. Start by letting all
    similar shapes (o, c, p, q, q etc) share the same sidebearing on the round parts,
    for example. The same goes for all the straight stems. Then work similar on all
    letters. Try to find connections. This makes the whole process easier when you
    are kerning later on also and can use class based kerning in a good way.\r\nLast
    but not least \u2013 you have a good concept and you followed it well \u2013 now
    it's all about polishing details and making some more decisions.\r\nKeep up the
    good work!"
