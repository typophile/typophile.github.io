body: 'Helllppppp!! A client wants this font! He is crazy about it, I mean really
  crazy! He bought this packaging somewhere in Italy. It''s been almost two days now
  since I am trying to find out what could it be. He likes this word ''Pesto'' a lot...
  so I hope it can help you to figure it  out. Even something similar could help.
  Thanks a million! '
