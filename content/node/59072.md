  body: "It's interesting that the sample has three P's and one doesn't match the
    other two. The only other repeated letters (I) are identical. So this is a font,
    but finding it is a problem, because it falls into the 'anyone could have made
    this' category of font design. You could scan through [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script14Pg1.html|Part
    14 of the Script Font ID Guide]] (Distressed Script), or look at Dafont (Brush)
    category.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
