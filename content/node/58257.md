  haven't yet been able to find anything that's close enough. I found them on a storefront
  dating from the 1800's. Both photos are quite old, but I'm not able to precisely
  date them or date when the signs were actually created.\r\n\r\nIn the first image,
  I'm looking for the type used to write \"patisserie\" and \"confiserie.\" Underneath
  the sign, \"Henri Auer\" is written in a different typeface that I haven't been
  able to ID yet either.\r\n\r\nThe second photo shows the storefront quite some years
  later. In this photo, \"Henri Auer\" has been inserted in the original sign, in
  a different typeface. \r\n\r\nAbove the storefront, another sign mentioning \"Patisserie\"
  and \"chocolaterie\" has been added, with yet another typeface. \r\n\r\nI'd really
  appreciate any help you all could give me in identifying these typefaces or finding
  existing fonts that are a close match. "

  body: For "patisserie" you might use something like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/gtype/sovereign_display_ot/">Sovereign</a>
    from G-Type and Letterhead Fonts has a quite a few that might match the others.

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions - But I didn't find anything close enough on the
    Letterhead Fonts site. They do have a lot of things in that style though. \r\n\r\nI've
    thought about re-drawing the letters, but the problem is that I need to write
    \"Maison Auer,\" and so that would imply creating certain letters that aren't
    on the sign..."

  body: "[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/quentin/|Quentin]] is similar to the older
    PATISSERIE lettering. Other Western or Tuscan styles might come close too.\r\n\r\nFor
    the PATISSERIE in the newer sign, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/itc-newtext/|ITC
    Newtext]] is fairly close, oddly enough.\r\n\r\nFontMesa and Solotype both have
    a fair number of fonts from this era. These were just the first things that came
    to mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions - Quentin may work, and I'm looking at things
    from FontMesa right now! Hopefully I'll find something fairy close.\r\n \r\nUnfortunately
    I still haven't found anything that ressembles the \"Henri Auer\" in the newer
    sign."
