  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi guys
Long time lurker.. first time poster ;)

So I feel like I've hit a wall when it comes to my personal logo. I designed this about two years ago in my last year of college. I've never really LOVED it.. but anything else I came up was never that good.. and I kind of just went with it. I've tried to alter a bit over the years.. but nothing has really changed my opinion of it.

Just want everyone's two cents on it. 

I've attached two images, the first one is the original one made in school.
The second image is a slightly altered (angled) version of the logo that I use on my website.

Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi there!

I'd have to say, I think the second version of the logo (in the header) is a lot less confusing. Even so, it is hard to make out the K and the R, especially because the K is backwards. I only figured it out in the header because your name was listed, so I was able to make out the initials.

I just don't see any connectivity between the design. Yes, it looks nice, but I think the reason it's confusing is because there's no sort of... unifying concept. For example, moving the line of the K to be in the same position as the line of the R just higher up (creating, in essence, a diagonal) may help unify the image slightly. Then again, that may be less readable. Also, I think the whole "D" part of the R is confusing, especially because you don't have a D in your initials (or at least aren't branding yourself with your middle initial, which could be a D I suppose).

I'm sorry I don't have more solutions to this. My best advice would be to go to the drawing board, bring us some concept images, and then we'll take it from there. I'll mull over this and post back if I have any more ideas, though!

I really need to hit the drawing board and come up with something better.

It's just so difficult.

		<div class="commentbody">The latest post (5.Oct.2009 7.59pm) does look amateurish - I think because the shapes of the curves in the "R" are not very well refined. (weight and thickness of the R is uneven; terminals of the stroke/shape are not consistent).

I couldn't see the version you posted that was from college - (first image in your original post) but the 2nd image in your original post was cleaner and had more "edge" than the latest curvy R version. This latest curvy one is a lot more feminine to me. I would try a different type face to perhaps make it more masculine.

I know it is so hard to come up with a personal logo! I find it a lot harder to design something for myself than a client. Good luck!

Step back and do some brainstorming sketching. Maybe don't focus on a monogram for now. Come up with some more abstract concepts. 

(I always hate to say 'monograms are overdone' when I, myself, use one for my business logo. That said, they do tend to be used a bit too often and sometimes are overly forced). </div>
