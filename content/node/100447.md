  body: "Although this looks like it might have been customised in some details titles
    these days are often straight use of a commercial font so I wouldn\u2019t rule
    that out. This does look familiar to me, I can\u2019t pin it down so it may just

    another font, used to be very popular 5 years ago, some sort of geometric sans
    with \"some (slab) serifs\", something like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeassociates/empirical/|Empirical]]...
    Can't remember it... "

    it seems likely to be plagiarized, so do be careful.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
