  body: "Hey Florian,\r\n\r\nI have noticed that in a few threads you have posted
    \ amazing lists with URLs of different classes of fonts like the one above. This
    seems to be taken from a thread or list you have saved from Typophile or locally.
    I noticed it too on another thread regarding contemporary sans faces. I like your
    listings as they always seems to contain high quality faces - omitting the older
    more tired renditions.\r\n\r\nWould you be willing to share this list with us
    or point me to the thread where you originally posted?\r\n\r\nJay"

  body: "thank you a lot, very nice fonts you have listed.\r\nI am actually looking
    for a font almost exactly like T-Star mono, but can't use T-Star in the norwegian
    language, it lacks \xE6,\xF8,\xE5 in some variations. I want the look t-Star mono
    have, but need all glyphs. Im looking at Naiv, but this is maybe to playful..\r\nThanks
    for all help, appreciate it.\r\n\r\n- Thomas"

  body: "Jay: I\u2019m sorry I have to disappoint you: there is no big master list.\r\nA
    number of special (or not-so-special) typeface genres come up here on typophile
    again and again.\r\nSome of them have been covered in <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/\">FontFeeds</a>,
    like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/extra-bold-ultra-black-fonts/\">The
    Extra Bold, Ultra Black Fonts</a> (see also <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/42643\">The
    Fat Font Fad List</a>). Others, like scripts, contructivist Bauhaus-style typefaces
    or lined fonts can be browsed on <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/\">Bowfin
    Printworks</a>. The [[TypoWiki]] has some lists, too.\r\n\r\nI remembered that
    we already had 2 or 3 threads about this rounded tech thing and searched for <a
    href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20gravur\">Gravur</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20t-star\">T-Star</a>,
    using this <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/12436\">favelet</a>.\r\nThus, I
    compiled a little list of the alternatives mentioned there, plus some more that
    came to my mind.\r\nNo magic involved, only a little help from TextExpander (a
    Mac app that helps to insert links etc., similar to Typinator or RapidoWrite).\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas:
    Why don\u2019t do ask <a href=\"http://www.gestalten.com/fonts/detail/?id=402881820693de75010693debc1600d3\">Die
    Gestalten</a> or <a href=\"http://www.binnenland.ch/\">Mika Mischler</a>? What
    about T-Star TW Pro?"
