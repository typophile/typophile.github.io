    regular Serif & San serif. Other than the point about the M being too far removed
    from the rest of the word 'moving', making it appear as 'Oving', I'd also sat
    that the Enlarged First Letters of each word are too disparately sized for it
    to be cohesive enough as a logo. In a word 'messy'.\r\n\r\nJH "

    the eye doesn't easily read the words in any particular order. We don't know where
    to start. The position of the words makes it read backwards. Why is the text broken
    this way? \r\n\r\nSecondly, the text sizes make 'people' the least important part
    of the logo. At small sizes that word is going to become unreadable.\r\n\r\nThirdly
    the mix of type styles seems not to be purposeful. Why is 'people' in caps? Why
    is 'moving' in a serif font?\r\n\r\nFourthly, what are the segment and the swoosh
    supposed to represent? Why is the graphic element obscured by the text? It looks
    very cluttered. \r\n\r\nFifthly, the m and p look poorly executed custom jobs."

  body: "Scratch my above comment. I didn't realize a board of directors would be
    reading this. \r\n\r\nHere instead is my (a bit cheeky but considered) advice:
    \r\n\r\n1. Hire a designer and trust their experience and expertise (it's what
    you're paying for) to design. And yes, as with almost everything in life, you
    generally get exactly what you paid for in terms of talent, experience, ability
    and quality of ultimate outcome.\r\n\r\n2. Take on a role of design expert or
    experienced art director in the project, if you've dedicated your professional
    life to the visual communications industry (or are secretly an unappreciated design
    genius\u2014aren't we all). Otherwise, don't. \r\n\r\n3. Designers are not robots
    who \"input my visionary direction into software programs I can't be bothered
    to learn.\" (If this approaches your conception of design, just hire a nephew
    who knows some photoshop).\r\n\r\n4. And remember, the phrase \"designed by committee\"
    is never, ever, ever a compliment. (It also implies unsteady leadership and lack
    of vision). Even ten brilliant individual art director visionaries, if they're
    put on a committee with everyone's input given equal weight, will produce a compromised,
    negotiated, bland, mediocritized, unfocused pile of mush).\r\n\r\n4. Did I just
    invent the use of mediocre as a verb? Mediocritized?\r\n\r\n5. Final Step: If
    you've done step one and only step one, enjoy your organization's professional,
    apropos and unique new visual identity.\r\n"

    it's worst qualities so that we can portray this fabulous little company as what
    it truly is: fresh, unique and energetic.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, one of the board
    members, working with a photographer, created this logo before my partner and
    I joined the board and took on design and tech support - pro bono - as our contribution.
    \ \r\n\r\nThe company has invested money in having signs made, and so cannot afford
    a new logo at this point (not to mention that the board member who created the
    travesty is still around and screaming about artistic rape). \r\n\r\nI have a
    work-around, and everyone on the staff is happy with the new design direction.
    \ This WILL come up at the next board meeting though, which is why we submitted
    it here and asked you all for your honest opinions.  Sometimes knowing you are
    right, and why you are right isn't enough.  You need back-up.  \r\n\r\nThank you

  body: Any chance of building a real logo, rather than a wordmark? With a short company
    name, you can sometimes incorporate it into a logo. But with such a long name
    (I thought it was a moving company, for a few minutes) you should build a real
    logo with no text, just something that says "Dance" graphically. Then use it with
    the company name set beside it.

  body: "It's great that at least now you're talking about the values of the company:
    fresh, unique and energetic. You will need to think a little harder about what
    makes the company unique though, then hopefully you can start to think about how
    those values are portrayed in the logo. That's what branding is. The current logo
    communicates no brand at all and it unlikely to succeed on its own. (What I mean
    is that unless somebody already knows about the company they are unlikely to suddenly
    get interested by seeing just the current logo.) \r\n\r\nThe unfortunate thing
    is, unless you have senior management buy-in you'll find that nothing can change.
    If they can't see for themselves that a new logo is an incredible asset, they're
    not going to be persuaded about something they don't understand.\r\n\r\nI'm speaking
    from the perspective not of a designer here, but of someone who has in the last
    six months taken an international company through a dramatic rebrand and met with
    a fair amount of resistance. I'm still not sure our Managing Director is convinced
    of the reasons we rebranded, but he does trust out judgment and that has been
    really important. \r\n\r\nIt sounds like the people in this company could benefit
    from talking to other organisations that have rebranded, to design agencies, and
    to their target market to find out their opinions. Our market thought our old
    brand was 'ok'. For a company positioning itself in the 'premium' category this
    was not what we wanted to hear. \r\n\r\nI hope I'm not teaching you to suck eggs

    one problem with their logo, which is to capture the energy of dance. But how
    they would react if a dancer came to audition for them, and did nothing but flail
    his arms and legs and head around in different directions, completely out of step
    to any rhythm or music or the dancers around him, and without a care in the world
    for whether his movements were communicating anything but confusion and disarray
    to the audience? \r\n\r\nA logo that doesn't get across the name of the company,
    that has no graphic rhythm and unity, and can't be used in any practical graphic
    applications without destroying them is just like that dancer."

  body: may as well add my 2 cents worth. i thought initially the 'logo' was for a
    moving company perhaps? as a logo should somehow - almost magically - distill
    and present some important essence of the company; this misses the mark, especially
    for a dance company - no lines, no grace, no movement, no fluidity. while it is
    unnecessary to be harsh, i doubt this helps sell the company's service which is
    the purpose of such things, no?
