  came in a series of widths much less pronounced than what we\u2019re used to today.
  The most obvious example is Alternate Gothic 1\u20133, which are closer in width
  than the extra condensed and condensed fonts of today\u2019s typefaces. These designs
  allowed typesetters to get a really nice fit for ad copy and headlines. Would a
  series like this be useful today? Or do designers prefer to just track and kern
  to fit rather than mess with different fonts?"

    also, when it was known as (photo) modification, or modding.\r\nH&FJ's Knockout
    should satisfy anyone who is interested in subtleties beyond that.\r\n\r\nIf you
    are considering a condensed niche market, I can tell you that when I was designing
    trade book covers, there never seemed to be enough styles of extremely condensed
    display typefaces available. For instance, I would consider Phaeton as only moderately
    condensed. I'm talking Empire/Bordeaux condensed."

    than one (at most two) condensed versions of a typeface. Someone working with
    news under tight deadlines might think otherwise.\r\n"

  body: I think it depends upon the typeface. I've licensed multiple widths of many
    sans simply because I know that in my work having a variety to fit different widths
    always helps. But if a width is too close to another then I won't license it.
    For instance. I will license Gotham X-Narrow, but I won't license Gotham Narrow.
    I can see how some people would find it useful. It isn't that it is bad or anything,
    it is just so close to the original I'd sooner just make the x-narrow or regular
    width work.
