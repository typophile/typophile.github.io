    class is good (plus she's a great person). Calligraphy classes?\r\nThere must
    be gobs of them. Try a community college - that's what I did.\r\n\r\nBTW, are
    you up north for good? I ask because:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/30444 _\r\nAnd
    it will offered again next semester.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the baby and the vandercook) are up north for a little while... doing some work
    up here.\r\n\r\nI am just looking for something that will force me to keep more
    active in drawing letters.\r\n\r\nj"
