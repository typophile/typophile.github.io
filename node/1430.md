body: 'Something I posted to the ATypI list recently: <BR> <BR>&#34; <BR>I don&#39;t
  usually feel like expressing myself especially strongly <BR>about magazine reviews
  of foundries or fonts&#42;, but Paul Shaw&#39;s <BR>article about House Industries
  &#40;with a particular focus on their <BR>Chalet and Neutra families&#41; in the
  current issue of Print is one <BR>of the most excellent such pieces ever. <BR> <BR>&#42;
  Not least because usually they&#39;re just fawning <BR>  placeholders between full-page
  ads - sometimes <BR>  ads for the font house in the review.  :-/ <BR> <BR>The article
  doesn&#39;t just benefit from Shaw&#39;s usual good <BR>writing, and isn&#39;t just
  distinguished by its handling <BR>of both macro and micro issues, it&#39;s refreshing
  in its <BR>combination of insight and candor. To me House Industries <BR>has been
  doing increasingly better work, but they might <BR>do well to heed Shaw&#39;s gentle
  corrective advice. <BR>&#34; <BR> <BR>In fact I think their new Shag fonts are timed
  perfectly! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>Somebody should contact Paul Shaw and ask <BR>him to put the article

  body: I can&#39;t agree with you on the Shaw piece, although I understand why you
    like it.  <BR> <BR>To me, reading Paul is too much like listening to Paul.  <BR>
    <BR>Did you miss him including his old parternship Letterperfect in his list of
    &#34;Mainstream&#34; foundries?  <BR> <BR>Letterperfect a mainstream foundry?
    <BR> <BR>And his crack about calligraphy being the &#34;upscale&#34; version of
    sign painting?  <BR> <BR>Calligraphers, who needs &#39;em. Give me a sign painter
    anyday.
