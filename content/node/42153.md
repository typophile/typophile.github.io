  When I'm hanging curly qoutes the margins seems very messy. How should I go about
  this?\r\n\r\nTypical norwegian usage is \xABarrow qoutes\xBB, but the auther provided
  me with \"curly qoutes\".  Should I still hang the qoutes if we change them? And
  how about paranteses?\r\n\r\nAdvice would be apreciated.\r\n\r\nf"

    haven\u2019t got a clue that software is even capable of such a thing, so not
    doing it isn\u2019t going to offend anyone."

    into the margin \u2014 and I didn't think it worked. The eye was continually drawn
    to them. \r\n\r\nBetter to go with single quotes I think \u2014 which is, after
    all, the British standard. Then kern them into the margin slightly."

    typesetter now. What does your eye tell you in this particular situation?"

    that single quotes are the standard in a place that is much closer to you than
    America. :)\r\n\r\nDouble quotes overwhelm a line of poetry IMO."

  body: When setting poetry, I usually hang quotes. Double ones as well, but less
    far out than single quotes. If you want to change it (e.g. to arrow quotes), make
    sure to check that with the writer of the poem, because from experience I know
    poets often consider everything in their poems very carefully. But that is obvious.

  body: "As long as we're giving personal points of view . . .\r\n\r\nWhen setting
    poetry, I usually do not hang quotes. It would depend on a number of factors.
    Since we only work for publishers, the publisher's editor usually has a strong
    preference. Lacking that, if for some reason I really want to hang the quotes,
    I would try to get up with the poet (assuming the publisher doesn't mind, i.e.,
    we'd go through the publisher).\r\n\r\nBefore even thinking of hanging the quotes
    though, I'd look at the poetry. Since hanging punctuation is not much used in
    the States in bookwork, hanging quotes tends to look like jacket blurbs & other
    advertising. Maybe it's different in Europe & other parts of the world. \r\n\r\nAn
    advertising look is usually not what you want in poetry. But poetry sometimes
    has multiple levels of indented lines, and sometimes there is a pattern to these
    indents. It use to be that the poet prepared the MS on a typewriter, i.e., always
    monospaced. Translating that feel into typeset copy can be challenging, and it
    was the comp's job to do that.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest jobs I worked on had
    long selections from A.R. Ammons. A copy of the tape had been cut apart & pasted
    up on 8.5x11 sheets & then photocopied, so it was now pages rather than the roll
    as split by Ammons. When you went from one sheet to the next, it was devilishly
    hard to tell you where you were in the indent structure.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nI
    have yet to find anything that overrides Ward's *Crystal Goblet* dictum for design
    & composition, but also find very few designers (or design teachers) who don't
    abandon it to strut their stuff & tart things up.\r\n\r\nFWIW\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think it depends on circumstances, one of which is the typeface.\r\nSome
    fonts have honking big quotemarks, others are more discreet.\r\n\r\nAnother thing
    to bear in mind is that poetry is often re-read--not later, but in the initial
    reading session--so I wonder if this business of hanging quotes is more or less
    of an issue in a re-read?"
