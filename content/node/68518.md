  body: "At this size and level of pixelation, it's a tall order. To me, the text
    <em>feels</em> like Rotis Sans or SemiSans, but many of the (visible) details
    don't match up, so no go.\r\n\r\nAre you sure there are no other larger specimens
    of this invite you can share here? \r\n\r\nDo you know how to contact the designer
    to ask them? \r\n\r\nGood luck..."

    inside, that vertical text, says "Linotype Textra; TRAJAN" :) So, sorry for the
    trouble and thanks for the replies.'
