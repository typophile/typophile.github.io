  body: Gerald - why do you respond that way? <BR> <BR>I am not questioning your response.

    work that parodies the letterpress medium, as somehow &#34;artistically&#34; more
    meaningful and superior than functional &#40;ie words to be read&#41; typography,
    and is hailed for such disrespect. <BR> '

  body: Thanks for the read - I was a little confused. Guess that shows how easily

    at selling the sizzle and not the steak.
