body: I have an aircraft that I have to do some paint work on. I'm replacing registration
  numbers, and the font that exists is what they want used. I took a tracing of one
  of the numbers, and have a couple of pictures, but I can't find an exact match.
  Is this Marathon Serial Heavy? The fonts displayed on myfonts.com look like they
  have sharper corners than what's painted on this bird.

  body: Thanks for the link. The stencil was made in vinyl, so this is probably what
    happened. Is there any way to identify the font to a particular company, if it
    is indeed an OEM font on some software for vinyl cutting? I'm about at wit's end.
    I had to use photos of the exxisting numbers and create them manually with software.
    It's not entirely too much work, but if there's an easier way, I'm all about it
    :)
