  has been doing, I want to update our site to include the fonts that we use in our
  identity. Unfortunately, we use Myriad Pro in a wide range of styles and Myriad
  Web only has 5 fonts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad_%28typeface%29#Myriad_Web)
  that don't really cover our needs. So, I'm looking for a suggestion for a typeface
  that we can use that is similar to Myriad Pro but available as a web font. I'd really
  like something with light, black and condensed versions. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThe
  image is just a clip of some of the different styles we intend to use.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help!"

  body: Even if Myriad Web would have a complete weight set available, I do not recomend
    it for languages where W is often used. When rendered on screen, Myriad Web's
    w has a very dark middle, as if the stems were duplicated. Hope Adobe correct
    this in a next version, with more weights.

  body: Yeah, Neue Frutiger seems to be the best choice. But why is the fonts.com
    website so hard to use? Geeze...

  body: "Does anyone use Segoe or Corbel - not as web fonts, but just specified in
    the CSS?  Segoe is not that different from Myriad, and a lot of Windows machines
    have it. Corbel is becoming common on Windows machines too.\r\n\r\nThere would
    be size issues - at the same pixel size I think Segoe looks really big, so that
    could be a challenge.  But maybe this would work?"
