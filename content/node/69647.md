  it as Win TrueType/OpenType TT and as OTF.\r\n\r\nBoth work well on a Mac, but client
  says OTF does not work on a PC. (\"Font can not be activated on a PC\")\r\n\r\nI
  thought that OTF works on both systems Mac and PC. Or am I wrong here?\r\n\r\nIs
  there a \"special\" adjustment in the preferences I have to make to get a OTF font
  that will work proper on a PC.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t have a PC to test
  : /\r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's a bit more complicated than that.... A *properly made* OpenType CFF
    (.otf) font works fine on Mac and Windows. But fundamentally, you can't be sure
    you have reliable cross-platform fonts without all the relevant platforms to test
    on. There are some fields in the font that are only relevant on one platform or
    the other.\r\n\r\nIs it just one font, or an entire family?\r\n\r\nOn a good day,
    I might offer to take a look, but I'm moving this week, so that would be foolish
    of me.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "You could send it to me as well, I just can't swear how quickly I'll look
    at it.\r\n\r\nI do recommend sending the whole family, because certain problems
    emerge at the family level. Though if NONE of the fonts can be activated, it probably
    isn't that class of problem.\r\n\r\nRunning CompareFamily and Font Validator is
    also a good idea, although it takes some experience and expertise to know what
    to do with the results.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    At the other hand, if the TTF variant(s) work(s) properly, this is less likely.\r\n\r\nFor
    checking the \u2018name\u2019 records, you can download the free Light version
