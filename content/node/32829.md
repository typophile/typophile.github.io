  of Reading and I've decided to accept the offer - and so it is time to think about
  accommodation.\r\n\r\nI have already gone through a thread here on Typophile where
  some great pointers are found - but it is a couple of years old (outdated?) and
  it doesn't answer all my questions. So I'm hoping some of you might be able to help
  me pick the right place.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a quiet and relaxed hall - ideally
  en suite room but it is not crucial. I've been looking at Hillside Court and Sherfield
  Hall based on tips on previously mentioned Typophile thread. I've seen no mention
  of Wesex hall even though it is in close proximity of the department. How would
  you describe these (and also Bridges Hall)? Should I be considering other halls?\r\n\r\nWhat
  would you, students of Reading, suggest for me?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    horror stories make better conversation than happy stories. The one universal
    complaint has been with catered accommodation: the food''s not great, and the
    meal hours are extremely restrictive, making it hard to fit them into a daily
    schedule. We''re on break right now so I don''t know how many people will be checking
    Typophile, but I''ll nudge the people who know more about the halls to checkin
    and offer some advice.'

    if anything good to say about catered halls. Sherfield is nice (or at least was
    12 years ago) but its a bit of a trek.  '

    to be most popular... or what? Is it quiet and nice? Any more tips?"

  body: "When I studied at Reading I experienced three kinds of accommodation: in-hall
    fully-catered (<a href=\"http://www.rdg.ac.uk/childsweb/\">Childs hall</a>), in-hall
    self-catered (<a href=\"http://www.rdg.ac.uk/UnivRead/Halls/hall_bridges.htm\">Bridges
    hall</a>), and in private house (<a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/gerryleonidas/sets/608423/\">Gerry's
    at Oaklands</a>). I recommend the latter.\r\n\r\nIn-hall fully-catered is definitely
    NOT a good option. The food is bad (lots of deep fried stuff, like fish and chips),
    the meal times are restrictive (plus you have to wait in a line, and, if I remember
    correctly, dinner is not served on weekends), it's way expensive (you pay double
    just because of the food), and you'll be disturbed by obnoxious undergrads.\r\n\r\nIn-hall
    self-catered can be OK, depending on the people you share the unit with. If someone
    decides to throw a booze-party in the pantry, you'll have a difficult time cooking
    your meal. And if they don't clean up afterwards, or if somethings gets broken,
    everyone in the unit will be held responsible and fees may apply. Apart from that,
    you get to have/cook your meals at your discretion, and the units tend to be quite
    because they're mainly filled with postgrad students.\r\n\r\nIn private house
    tends to be the best, but it's good to know in advance the people you'll be sharing
    the house with. It requires a fair amount of discipline, community sense, and
    organization, to keep life running smoothly and everyone happy. It can be the
    most enjoyable and least restrictive accommodation option, as long as everyone
    is responsible and respects each other. And, in general, you won't have to worry
    about keeping everything locked (room, belongings, food), unlike in the halls."

  body: At this moment I study in Reading and live in St. George's Hall. The accomodation
    is very small, but I am lucky that the people I share the unit with are quiet
    and serious, sometimes there are parties, but they never last longer than 01.00.
    Besides, I have very nice classmates who invited me regularly in their 'normal'
    houses. And then there are the firedrills, there not very nice especially the
    one's in the night. It is a good second option to live in a Hall. The only nasty
    thing is the cooking, when everyone is in it can be very busy and if you are not
    the first you have to wait.

    than to 1 is quite acceptable. The student housing I live in now  has alot of
    people that break that rule (having parties til 5 or 6) and it can get quite annoying

    also find houses off campus that have single rooms to rent (for example, a landlord
    with a four bedroom house who rents the rooms individually or a group looking
    for a house-mate). The University accommodation office has listings like these
    or you might be able to find them in classifieds. \r\n\r\nBut, you won't really

    wondering about things like:\r\n- Bridges & Wessex Halls, so close to the dept.
    why no mention?\r\n- Sherfield, long distance but is it worth it?\r\n- Which Hall
    has the best en suite rooms (self catered)?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "I'd check out <a href=\"http://www.rdg.ac.uk/Wantage/\">Wantage Hall</a>.
    They tend to put mature students in the 'Old Court', which has spacious rooms
    and is very quiet compared to St. Georges etc. It's also considered the most 'elegant'
    of the residences here.\r\n\r\nThe same also applies to St. Patricks but i can't
    say the food there was any good!\r\n\r\nThe en suite rooms here tend to be small
    and miles away from the department. Bulmershe campus has nice accomodation but
    it's a small trek away from the main campus. Student village is also decent and
    tends to be occupied by international students. Stay away from Bridges, Childs
    & Wessex halls!\r\n\r\nOh, i almost forgot... Whiteknights hall is also another
    good possibility, some en-suite rooms, located on campus and relatively modern!\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps...\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I stayed in Sherfield when I was at Reading (2003) and I highly recommend
    it. The rooms are large by student halls standards and you get to have a private
    bathroom which is quite an important thing. There's also a cleaning lady that
    fixes up the kitchen every day and the room once a week. This is quite a treat
    as the only bit of housework you'll do is the dishes.\r\n\r\nThe hall is 5-6 minutes
    off from Queens' drive but you'll need a total of around 25 minutes to get to
    the department as it is on the other side of campus. Still, it's a wonderful campus
    and if you get a bicycle it'll be quite ok.\r\n\r\nI was lucky to have very nice
    flatmates and in a way was a good thing to have my course friends and a seperate
    group of \"normal\" people. It makes you able to switch off from type design (i
    need that sometimes).\r\n\r\nThe hall organises some parties, pub crawls, and
    pub quizes. It also has the JCR which is quite handy if you feel like going out
    but can't be bothered to get to town. The computer room and laundry are quite
    ok as well.\r\n\r\nWe had some fire drills. I actually accidentally caused the
    fire alarm to go off (at 10 pm) because i was boiling pasta and 2 other pots of
    vegetables and had the kitchen windows closed. It was cold outside and we actually
    thought it was really as we were the only house that got evacuated. It's one of
    those things you laugh about afterwards.\r\n\r\nThere is a downside though. You
    can never know who you get as flatmates. One of mine finished in June and we got
    a series of unfortunate flatmates afterwards: \r\n- a guy who would walk around
    in very brief boxers (it was difficult to have conversations with him...)\r\n-
    a guy who cooked salmon in the oven and invited all his friends but did not clean
    up afterwards. The whole building stank of fish.\r\n- a guy who had loud sex \r\n-
    a guy who was just weird \r\n- we also had a girl who caused a racket every time
    she was on the phone\r\n\r\nStill, it was a wonderfull experience and Sherfield
    is a great place. As far as I know, they usually place postgraduates together
    so you might be able to escape the noise.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps. Enjoy Reading!"
