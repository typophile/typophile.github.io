    [[Xavier Dupr\xE9]]'s other typeface for Emigre, works well as a companion to
    his Vista Sans. See it in practice in our <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/2007-fontshop-calendar-november/\">November
    07 calendar</a>.\r\n\r\nDupr\xE9's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Zingha\">Zingha</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_reminga/\">FF
    Reminga</a> are other serifs infused with his signature flavors."
