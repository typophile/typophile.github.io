body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI am in desperate need of some much needed critique for a
  logo I am developing. The logo is for a sportswear company I am starting up.\r\n\r\nThe
  company name is fourmation, I did want to use the company name formation but couldn't.
  I then justified calling it fourmation because of the numbers used for formations
  in sport etc...drill me if I need drilling haha.\r\n\r\nAnyways I decided that because
  its a logo going on sportswear that in needs to be simple, effective and work in
  one colour only. Attached is a concept that stood out for me, the word fourmation
  will appear below it. I wanted the logo to refer to the number four somehow but
  not in a cliche way...I am sure we call all dream up something in no time using
  the number 4, I didn't want it to be that easy.\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the logo
  there is both a \"f\" and a \"4\", I need to know if this is obvious enough to work?
  I am worried that the 4 doesn't look convincing enough, am I right?\r\n\r\nPlease
  help!!!\r\n\r\n"

    shouldn't be a problem.\r\nOnly thing is, I keep seeing an H in the white."

  body: "Prior to reading the post and only looking at the mark, I saw two 'f's at
    first. And then I saw the H in the middle.\r\n\r\nThat may not be an issue at
    all, but thought I'd mention it FWIW. Having the name 'fourmation' underneath
    might remedy that completely. I don't think the 4/f thing is obvious, but being
    overly obvious isn't necessarily something you need to have for a successful logo.

  body: "Thanks heaps for your comments guys, really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI did spot
    the \"H\" in the middle and I also saw this as a potential problem. Personally
    I like that logo as a visual, it's simple but is it effective?\r\n\r\nI don't
    know if the \"f\" and the \"4\" need to be obvious, maybe they do, I am unsure
    of this. But as mentioned you then have the \"H\" forming, this could be a big
    problem I think.\r\n\r\nI like it but is the execution there? Is there to many
    questions to be asked of the logo rather than just working?\r\n\r\nPlease help
    you awesome people you!!!"

  body: The whole thing feels squished vertically.  I think you could bring out the
    F/4 idea more, and get rid of the H problem.  Maybe try having the two parts relate
    to each other differently, like shifting one right and one left.  Good start!
