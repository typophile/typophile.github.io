  body: "Late 19th century book designer, type designer and fontographer who revived
    medieval designs and was a major influence on the style of published books. His
    fonts are a fusion of Blackletter and Roman. His books used very ornate designs
    often involving vines and leaves. Your _O_ is a comfortable companion to his designs.

    of his influence at http://typophile.com/node/114418\r\nDon\r\n"
