  be. I have already searched a lot but obviously not in the right places.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5467_1949dce30740a3cd14bc4675995af59962b641fe_5058.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  text makes no sense because I removed some duplicate letters to try on whatthefont,
  which didn't work.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance if anybody identifies this."

  body: "Frankly, the preview at Blambot isn\u2019t very user-friendly. I usually
    go to MyFonts (for the commercial fonts) and Dafont (for the sfreeware) to customize
    the preview of Mr. Piekos creations. \r\n\r\nOh, and you are welcome. "
