  MS VOLT. My question is:\r\n1- How can I add different styles in Arabic Script in
  one Open Type font?\r\n2- What is best tool for OTF, MS VOLT or Font Lab v.5.0?\r\n3-
  An Arabic medial form can occupy any glyph or it must be placed in a specific glyph?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nby

  body: "1. Styles? Calligraphic, old style, like such? You could consider creating
    a separate font for these. For a single font, InDesign (and other Adobe software)
    support stylistic sets -- the features \"ss01\" through \"ss20\" --, which can
    be used to toggle any glyph with any other, but if the application doesn't support
    it you cannot use these. I think Adobe's Poetica has been used as a test case
    for stylistic sets with several different calligraphic initials.\r\n\r\n2. For
    the moment, MS VOLT is the only program I know that can handle mark and mkmk features
    as well as (never used these) specialized arabic placements and substitutions.
    FontLab lags behind. OTOH, with FontLab you can <em>draw</em> glyphs, and that's
    not possible with VOLT. Perhaps you can combine them. (And create TTF flava fonts,
    rather than CFF -- MS VOLT can only work with the first.)\r\n\r\n3. The medial
    forms have their own Unicode points assigned. Although technically it is not <em>required</em>
    to use the code points -- because, hopefully, your OTF code will sort it out --,
    but any non-OpenType savvy programs won't be able to use medials."
