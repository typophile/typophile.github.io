  it considered poor form to just leave those glyphs empty?\r\n\r\nAlso, it has a

    result looks like dung. When you scale glyphs down, they do get smaller. The weight
    gets lighter as well. Too light.\r\n\r\nSecondly, most layout software (e.g.,
    InDesign) will not programmatically kern unscaled letters with scaled letters
    -- you have to do it by hand, in each instance. So, for example, with footnote
    calls, if you scale full-size numerals, you cannot programmatically kern them
    when they follow quotedblright, as is almost always needed. Or follow a period,
    comma, etc.\r\n\r\nYou need to decide if you are making up a font for your own
    use only, in which case what you do follows the principle of the one that applies
    to the privacy of your own bedroom, or a font for other people to use, in which
    case you need to consider what they might expect."

  body: "Well, sorta, kinda Thomas. I don't know LaTeX, or the Mac, but we ran plain
    TeX out of a DOS box on Windows machines for 10 years, setting all manner of scholarly
    books. The thing is, you're not limited to the Windows or Mac encoding vectors.
    Our font files were what I called \"font data bases\" and most had over 400 characters.
    They looked remarkably like a modern, up-to-date OpenType font, except must use
    names. You can only encode 254 at once, but you can pick what you include in an
    \"instance\" of a font by a custom encoding vector. \r\n\r\nKerning too is part
    of the large, database font; if you make a change, you make it there -- no need
    to worry about, say, cap-cap kerning values in both a small caps font and a regular
    UC-lc font. \r\n\r\nAnd the glyph names can be correct, so the underlying text
    file needs no little lies in it about what the characters are. (For character
    names, I used the AGL supplemented by common sense, but toward the end, I just
    used \"uni0000\" (where 0000 was the correct Unicode number) as a name.\r\n\r\nYou
    can also fill out the AFM to provide automatic ligaturing, at least, for the very
    few programs that make use of the AFM file -- something most people didn't know.
    With TeX, the TFM is based on the AFM, and can be made to preserve such instructions.
    As one example, we added \"gg\" and\"zz\" and \"ggy\" etc. ligs for a number of
    italic fonts; when the ligature glyphs were there and encoded, they would be used
    automatically. \r\n\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\nOK, I don't know LaTeX, but this is what I
    mean by saying if one would read enough to understand what was possible -- as
    well as what's usually considered desirable -- you're miles ahead than if you
    ask 1,000 basic questions, one at a time, on an internet forum.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nFor
    the Original Poster -- here's a link showing the use of TeX to set scholarly books.
    Fonts used were all PostScript (starting from pfb + afm), though most were custom,
    as indicated above. I imagine anything you an do with TeX you can do with LaTex
    (though it might take more effort to undo some macros?)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tsengbooks.com/\r\n\r\nSee

    world, which is a tiny subset of publishing, let alone font use.\r\n\r\nWhich
    is why, in the broader world, Type 1 is pretty much dead as a format for new fonts.\r\n\r\nNot
    that Alice shouldn't make what she needs for her own use, of course! Just that
    if she wants to sell it, or release it as a libre font, or otherwise make it available

    There is the TeX-specific TFM file for ligature info, but that is not part of

    names for the five most common ligatures, even in Type 1 fonts. But that's pretty

  body: "I believe Build forum would be the best one for this question, but it can
    be answered here anyway.\r\n\r\nIMO, to let these positions empty is a poor procedure.\r\n\r\nThe
    glyphs included on ISO 8859-1 are actually a quite reduced set these days, when
    support for languages is always growing. ISO 8859-1 just holds Western European
    idioms \u2013but it is OK to do a font with it if your goal is to use the fonts
    just with these languages. In other hand, to offer a partial codepage support
    is not good. Users would be surprised not to find some basic characters your font
    is supposed to have. And codepages were designed exactly to define standards to
    which fonts, OSs, and applications would comply with.\r\n\r\nRegarding super and
    subscript, you are right that most text editors can build these characters from
    the normal ones. But the software do this scaling down the original figure and
    this causes very thin stems and strokes. The result is a weak, somewhat anemic
    super/subscript character.\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Superetsub_6363.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    second line shows 1, 2 and 3 scaled down by the editor while the third line uses
    1, 2 and 3 included on the font (Helvetica Neue and Minion Pro). Note that vertical
    positions are also adjusted by the font designer to produce optimal results considering
    the overall design.\r\n\r\nYou may evaluate the difference as small, but keep
    in mind that typographic quality is determined by details. Small differences become
    huge when in use.\r\n\r\nFractions are an even worse matter as editors are not
    capable to produce them from the normal figures. Here, you need proper glyphs
    in the font.\r\n\r\nAs you pointed, what is included in ISO 8859-1 is not enough.
    This standard is old, a legacy from the times when fonts were limited to 256 characters.
    To achieve 0-9 super and subscript you need to include the whole set of figures
    in your font. These figures are coded in the 2070 block from Unicode, the standard
    that replaced former ISO codepages. Fractions beyond the basic ones are coded
    in the 2150 block.\r\n\r\nAnyway, there is nothing wrong to adopt ISO 8859-1.
    This is your first font and you can do additions like super/subscript and fraction
    in a future moment. Just ensure that all glyphs are properly named and coded since
    the beginning.\r\n\r\nFinally, characters you can add depend on your purpose.
    Do you want to support Polish or Norwegian? Do think it is nice to offer arrows
    and bullets? Define your target and then do a research on Unicode tables. Euro
    sign, proper quotes, en dash, and em dash are a good start point."

  body: "First, apologies to Alice for hijacking her thread. No reason for her to
    keep on reading this!\r\n\r\nShort version: Charles is right about ligatures being
    supported in the AFM, although it raises a number of questions about where that
    data continues on to on Mac and Windows. Of course, the existence of ligature
    definitions in an AFM doesn't imply any other typographic features, nor that the
    ligature info is used.\r\n\r\nLong version:\r\n\r\nCharles, I was surprised by
    your AFM, since I knew that I had actually read the entire Type 1 format back
    in the day, and hadn't ever noticed this. In fact, I still have it (version 1.1)
    as a real printed book on my bookshelf. So I simply pulled it down to check.\r\n\r\nTurns
    out that the AFM format is not <em>technically</em> part of the Type 1 spec. It
    is mentioned exactly once in passing in the book, and even then only in the context
    of Adobe wanting to get AFM files from vendors under some particular circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis
    makes sense in some ways: it is not included in platform-specific Type 1 flavors
    for Mac or Windows, for instance. But it is certainly a good data source relating
    to the font, and I'd never read the AFM spec. There is the ligature support at
    the bottom of page 32, for sure. http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/5004.AFM_Spec.pdf\r\n\r\nSome
    things in AFM files, such as kerning info, are preserved in translation to the
    platform-specific PFM or font suitcase files used on Windows and Mac, respectively.
    I certainly think of kerning as being \u201Cpart of\u201D a Type 1 font, even
    if it isn't in the Type 1 spec per se. I have no idea if the ligature info is
    preserved in those translations as well, although I doubt it\u2014if it is, few
    if any clients use it."
