  body: "I will give you my opinion as Media and Communication Designer.\r\nThe intro
    page hasn't a nice layout, logo is nice and so is Letter & Design but first, why
    do you need bullets to say it is a menu? and second why do you have a menu so
    big? 10pt or 9 pt would be good enough. Sometimes the simple and tiny things are
    better! All the layout of the website has that problem. Then the problem of colors.
    The white and the orange it's ok (as i said i like the logo) but about that grey...\r\nI'm
    just trying to give a constructive critique!!! Just so you can improve and get
    a nice website... Nothing harmful really!!! don't take to that point.\r\n\r\nAbout
    portfolio i just have to say... amazing! I'm starting with italics and so too
    and looking to your work is an inspiration! Keep on!\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // youremin\r\nsound

  body: "Yeah I agree with Joel about the menu. Also I found it slightly annoying
    that I couldn't click on the words, instead had to click on the bullets. Maybe
    it could be higher too - I'm not using a huge screen so I actually have to scroll
    down to see the \"Lettering and Design\" :)\r\n\r\nI love your Chicago script!"

  body: "Thanks to everyone! :)\r\n\r\nDave, thanks for catching that.\r\n\r\nStephen.
    Thank you. Chicago Script is an exclusive font that I made for Letterhead fonts.\r\n\r\nJoel,
    I appreciate your comments. To be honest I am not a web designer. (this is my
    second webpage). I am at the mercy of the software that I am using. It does not
    allow links on flash based objects. I wish I could have made the looping stop
    and only show the effect once but the text would disappear.Very frustrating. So
    that is why there are bullet points so people would know where to click.  :)\r\n\r\nHave
    a nice week!"

    that in your favour? It's kind of a lack on your website! You could use your lettering
    skills to make the layout. A website doesn't have to have animation, the animation
    won't give anything unless it's really well done. If you don't know how to give
    a link to the text i think you should do what you know... lettering. There are
    many HTML pages really good! Better than most with animation!\r\n\r\nJoel Santos
