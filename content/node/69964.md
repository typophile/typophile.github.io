  body: "That lettering looks quite inconsistent, suggesting it was hand-drawn. Identical
    letters don't look identical. For something close I think Radim Pesko's <a href=\"http://www.radimpesko.com/fonts/larish-neue\">\"Larish
    Neue\"</a> is fairly close in most of these letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
