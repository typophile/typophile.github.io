  rather extensively. For the past few months I\u2019ve been trying to find a sans
  pairing for it, without much luck. I think my problem is that I\u2019m going about
  it the wrong way. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking for something like Futura Bold. The problem
  with Futura Bold/Electra is that the x-heights are really different, and next to
  the restrained elegance of Electra, Futura Bold looks a bit like an uncultured brute.
  Which isn\u2019t necessarily bad. But it just doesn\u2019t look good.\r\n\r\nI welcome
  suggestions for energetic sans-serifs, but more than that, I\u2019m looking for
  a suggestion of a methodology. How do I go about finding a pairing that makes visual,
  historical, and ideological sense, while providing enough contrast?\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance."

    is the recently-released [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brandon-grotesque/|Brandon
    Grotesque]].\r\n\r\nBrandon may have some of the restrained elegance and warmth
    you seek. It's roman also has a binocular 'g' like Electra.\r\n\r\nAs for your
    later questions, check out [[http://typophile.com/node/32056|these threads]] if
    you haven't already."

    with Trade Gothic for one such project, and I think it worked quite well. Visually
