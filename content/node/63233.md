  the fonts are labeled but a lot of them are not. So I am hoping that some of you
  will be able to identify these fonts for me. I am hoping to take an independent
  study on letterpress next semester so I am cleaning up and organizing all the type
  in preparation. Here are 4 to begin with, thanks.\r\n\r\n"

    letterpress foundry]] I would say the H is Gill Sans Bold? The serif h is possibly
    Bodoni Semi-bold italic?\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Tamas Ferencz ---"
