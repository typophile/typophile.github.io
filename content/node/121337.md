  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SecretOfTheIncasSM_5111.jpg]\r\nI wonder if
  a fan, or anyone else, has used this as model for a font, either flat or 3-D.\r\nI
  can't recall any similar fonts that are particularly close. I would be interested
  to learn what might exist in this rather unusual genre.\r\nA larger scale image
  is attached.\r\nThanks for your attention.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "I would bet somewhere in one of Dan X. Solo\u2019s exotic alphabets there
    is something like that.\r\nIn my cursory search, decorative typefaces visually
    inspired by stone tend to presents each letter as carved from a single piece (albeit
    often crumbling) instead of composed by blocks, while those composed by bricks
    tend to have a very flat and clean cut.\r\nRegarding the 3D aspect, one I found,
    not at all similar, but somewhat as much monumental, is http://www.fontspace.com/manfred-klein/mk-typobricks-rough\r\nAnother
    search term could be \u201Cblock\u201D, example: http://www.fontspace.com/crolrene/wodenbloks\r\nLastly,
    a place where the concept has been explored is certainly Fontstruct. Unfortunately
    its content isn\u2019t easy to navigate and filter.\r\nTwo samples which could
    or could not be of interest to you:\r\nhttp://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/levelrebel\r\nhttp://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/brickybrickbold\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Riccardo and Ryuk for the interesting answers.\r\nThe concrete blocks
    photos are good. Could be the basis of an interesting font.\r\nSame for The Incredible
    Hulk lettering.\r\nAs for the existing scalable fonts: \r\nRock Steady by the
    excellent comic book lettering artist,  Nate Piekos,  has an appropriate treatment
    for the face. Could be applied to other face designs, including the polygonal
    stones used by the Incas. Could be extended to the 3D treatment. I agree that
    his company, Blambot, and the other comic book company, ComicCraft are the most
    likely places for finding something in this genre. Perhaps also PizzaDude.\r\nMegalithic
    has some promise. Unfortunately the author, Daniel Ortega, did not refine the
    Dan Zadorozny's Hulkbuster design so that the structure works as well in basic
    black and white as it does in the version showing shades of grey.\r\nThe other
    suggested fonts also give hints as to what is feasible. For example MAWNS Rock
    shows what can be done with a simplified graphic treatment of wear and tear, but
    would be much more useful in a version without all the loose rubble.\r\nYou have
    both been most helpful. Shows its worth digging further.\r\nDon\r\n"
