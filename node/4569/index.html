But are in two minds about the direction for our identity.  <BR> <BR>We have two ideas which I would like to put forward.  <BR> <BR>1 - Scratch Graphics &#40;or&#41; Vendetta Design : Focusing on graphic design within the creative industry, but also extending to brand/corporate identity. <BR> <BR>2 - Focusing our own identity on the fact we are brothers, therefore using our own surname and exploiting the brotherly LOVE/HATE relationship.   <BR> <BR>I guess what I am asking, is would we be limiting ourselves from prospective clients if we name ourselves SCRATCH GRAPHICS / VENDETTA DESIGN. We are trying not to jump into an identity too soon.   <BR> <BR>The more I think this through, the more I am looking at the BROTHER identity. But would appreciate feedback from anyone offering their profound knowledge and experience. <BR> <BR>Take care <BR>kumbuniko <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">You&#39;re definitely creating a recognizable and memorable identity if you use your surname, especially if your main marque is something, for the lack of a better phrase, horrifying or scary.

		<div class="commentbody">Vendetta. Brothers. Manson. What is this, an Emigre promo?  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>I think incorporating &#34;Manson&#34; would be great if the target clientele is &#34;edgy&#34; &#40;like Chase says&#41;. The fact that your surname is indeed Manson means nobody can hold any allusions to criminality against you &#40;at least not formally&#41;. And when somebody asks you if Charles&#39;s reputation had anything to do with your choice of name, you can tailor your answer depending on what kind of person is asking! It can help you create an atmosphere, an illusion, based on the needs at hand. <BR> <BR>Visually: I would try some kind of Yin/Yang opposition/unity thing &#40;but not too literal a reference to the Yin/Yang symbol itself&#41;. Here&#39;s one of my most favorite logos &#40;by Gahlord Dewald&#41;: <a href="http://www.thtfct.com/" target="_blank">http://www.thtfct.com/</a> <BR> <BR>BTW, note that &#34;Manson&#34; is &#34;man&#34;&#43;&#34;son&#34;; maybe you can play the sibling aspect into that. Like maybe some kind of tree with two branches? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you&#39;re going for an eccentric angle, perhaps a near-minimalist logo would work nicely. The yin/yang idea is a good basis, but it&#39;s a pretty common reference.  <BR> <BR>You could use Hrant&#39;s literal idea and design a stylized man that tesselates with itself, either in the same size or in two complementary sizes &#40;man &amp; son&#41;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant <BR> <BR>The &#34;man&#34; &#43; &#34;son&#34; was somethng we were thinking of exploiting with regards to our brotherly competitiveness. Promotional material which illustrated that envy, jealousy, and immature brotherly habits &#40;such as the border within the shared bedroom&#41; played a large role in our individual stride to &#34;out-do each other&#34;. <BR> <BR>We intend to target the &#34;edgy&#34; clientele despite which name we choose. But were concerned with regards to corporate identity. <BR> <BR>Do corporate identity jobs tend to be conservative clients? Would YOU be turned off by a surname?  <BR> <BR>We have constantly been asked throughout our lives about our surname. Resultng in us giving them the answer they were hoping for. Then it changed with Marilyn heading into the mix. <BR> <BR>I tend to be optimistic with regards to our name. And since we will also be striving into brandng/advrtising, it could make for a brilliant edge with promotional material. <BR> <BR>All your feedback has been great, spurred us both into further discussions and scenarios. I want to get this decided well before my institutional study ends. <BR> <BR>take care</div>
