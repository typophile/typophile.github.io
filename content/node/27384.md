  body: Rome is fantastic. Go there. There are beautiful letters everywhere, not just
    ancient Roman examples. Don't forget Trastevere or the Vatican on your letter
    hunt!

    are some pics</a> I took when I was in Rome for ATypI in 2002.

    a type/font/caligraphic specific library there?

  body: "Just in general. I don't know what is in the museum (I didn't have time to
    go in when I was there), but St. Peter's and the piazza have enough.*\r\n\r\nMake
    sure to go down into the vault underneath the church where so many Popes are interred.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, you can't ever get <em>enough</em>\u2026 but they certainly have enough
    to occupy a good few hours, or years."

    just camp out there for months or years - there is so much great stuff there.
    \r\n\r\nThierry, thanks for the photos in that link!\r\n\r\nAnd Rinaldo for your
    links too!"

  body: Sorry, I'm late but if you haven't visited the Vatican Museum you haven't
    seen anything. Sorry Dan, a good excuse to go back! It's amazing but you really
    need some time to see it all. The Museo Bodoniano is in Parma, about 5 hours by
    train or something like that (depends on the train!). Enjoy Italy.

  body: "> it\u2019s easy to forget\r\n\r\nYou may well be right. However, I was thinking
    of attempting to meet Emil Kozak & / or the typo-tones. It was mentioned that
    Cyrus Highsmith is fond of Barcelona as a source of inspiration. Cyrus: any chance
    you would chime in? Anyway, thanks for looking out for me Hrant!"

    The collection of Islamic manuscripts is extraordinary, as are the earliest known
    New Testament manuscript fragments.
