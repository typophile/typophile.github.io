body: "I work for a company that makes news reading app. We were looking into the
  possibility of using fonts like FF Meta for articles (due to it being great even
  in the small screen size of iPhone) and FF Meta Condensed for headlines, mostly
  because these are also available as webfonts and the overall reading experience
  remains the same for a user throughout.\r\n\r\nWhat is the cost of licensing fonts
  in this case? We are not providing the end user an option to create work using these
  fonts, just giving them articles rendered in this font.\r\n\r\nOther examples of
  the use I am referring to include Flipboard using Helvetica Neue Condensed in it's
  app and The Daily using FF Unite, Founders Grotesk fonts in the app. \r\n\r\nAlso
  if there is a need to license the fonts for this purpose, please also suggest free
  fonts that I can use for distribution without the huge costs and preferably available
  as webfonts too.\r\n"

    on the device. You need to talk to the makers of these fonts individually to negotiate
    a license. '
