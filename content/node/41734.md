  corresponding italic. I happy with the spacing for my Roman font and the Italic
  version was based on the Roman.\r\n\r\nRr"

  body: "Rachel, if it is a true italic, then I would say no. The individual character
    shapes, and thus the interfit, are different. It might be possible with an oblique
    version of a roman face. However, since the widths are effectively measured on
    the baseline, the point of origin of each character would have to be shifted to
    the left inorder to create a kind of \"kerned\" character.\r\n\r\nCharles"

  body: Not the sidebearings, but perhaps the width and also some kerning pairs. It
    all depends on how the italic looks. A good thing when it comes to space Italics
    is to use the measurement line on a good positioin in the vertical middle as a
    guide for straight stems. Also keep in mind that the italic should be able to
    work with the roman, so normally after slanting I shift all the glyphs a little
    bit to the left when the Italic is based on the Roman version.
