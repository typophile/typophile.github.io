body: "Dear typophiles:\r\nI'm experimenting with a blurred version of one of my typefaces.
  I have all glyphs as outlines, please see example:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MN-Miso-Chunky_6586.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  is what I'm trying to achieve:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MN-Miso-Chunky2_5340.png]\r\n\r\nI
  used Photoshop to blur the first image (Filter>Blur>Gaussian) and then Threshold
  (Image>Adjustment) to get the black/white image.\r\n\r\nMy question:\r\nIs there
  a way of doing this while maintaining a vector format? (inside Illustrator for example?)\r\n\r\nBest\r\n/M\xE5rten"

    Trace > Make\r\n- Live Trace > Expand\r\n- Simplify paths\r\n\r\nI got some pretty
    nasty paths that way, but it keeps you in Illustrator."

  body: "Thanks for your replies!\r\nAnt\xF3nio: I guess it would almost work, but
    not give quite the \"blur\" effect I'm looking for.\r\nAlan: This works, but I
    was hoping there was a way to avoid the \"rasterize\" part.\r\n\r\nAny other ways
    to go about it? Thanks!"

  body: btw, you can use the Scripts palette in Illustrator to automatize this process
    once it's ok for you.
