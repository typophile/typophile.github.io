  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Could anyone tell a complete technical dunce (me) about the Fontlab Photofont program.
Am I right in thinking it allows photographs to be used in the same way as a vector font?
Can the photos be of a very high resolution?
Once the font is made, is it something that can be used generally in all programs (Word, Quark, Photoshop, etc), i.e. could it be sold?
I am planning to photograph carved letters, lift the actual carved letters out of their background and then make a font from these letters. It can then be typed out onto a series of different backgrounds. Is this feasible? Or shall I just go back to my workshop and chew some straw.
Any advice greatly appreciated.

Photofont is more of a "platform" than "program", developed by Fontlab Ltd. There is the photofont format, which can be fonts that consist of arbitrarily high resolution, and that support alpha transparency so you can make them work over arbitrary backgrounds. 

Then, there currently is Photofont Start (for Photoshop and Illustrator) as well as Photofont WebReady (for web pages), in which you can use the photofonts you made. Within the next few weeks, we will release Photofont ID (for InDesign) and Photofont QX (for QuarkXPress). We have no current plans to support Microsoft Word, though. 

Finally, there is BitFonter, in which you can create your photofonts, by either drawing directly or converting existing photographs into photofonts. 

You can find more information at: 
http://www.photofont.com/

Photofont Start etc, are required to allow someone to use the bitmap fonts in other various programs.
Thanks a million guys.

Would anyone with the necessary computer wizardry and experience in font design wish to collaborate in making a carved letter font? (possible name "Say It In Stone")
Imagine - images of authentic looking inscriptions in any stone or material without employing a carver. Not the be-all-and-end-all, but could fill a niche, and would be fun. 
I have some ideas and preliminary work done, and can do the lettering, but am going to need expertise with the computer/graphic side of things.

		<div class="commentbody">mark, I’d be happy to help on a Photofont where I can but I can’t actually afford Bitfonter right now. If you’re interested drop an email to james dot puckett at gmail. 

And I don’t mean to derail the thread but I think that if Fontlab really wants Photofonts to take off there needs to be a way to create them without spending another $500 on software. Us hip young designers who like playing with new technology are all broke and will be for the foreseeable future. For a letterer and a font designer to collaborate on one Photofont requires a $1,000 investment in software, and I’m not sure how quickly one can expect to recoup that selling bitmap fonts that require users to install a plugin. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">James, 

I can relate to your concerns. We have plans to at some point make a more affordable Photofont-creation application, but nothing in the immediate future. As you may understand, we are a small company and developing software is a costly matter, and I'm sure you'll agree that just as type designers deserve to be rewarded for their design effort, so are software developers who help them achieving that goal. 

Also please note that early adopters of a technology may sometimes pay a higher price but they will also have a competitive advantage over others. 

I'm glad that you referred to buying software as "investing" rather than "spending". Indeed, I see it the same way. BitFonter is US$499. If you price your photofonts at $25 a copy, you only need to sell 20 copies to cover the software investment costs. I don't think this is an unreasonably high risk. 

Best,
Adam

Digitally cultured stone, one letter for always, and the same carver seem like blandness waiting to happen. I hope you have some stone-veining, opentype or other handiwork to augment the methodical minded machines.;)

		<div class="commentbody">Adam, I certainly do believe that software developers deserve compensation. I’m just not sure that I could sell 20 of a copies photofont right now. There’s an extra marketing challenge here: most end-users don’t know what a photofont is. But maybe if I do well with my other fonts I’ll go ahead and give a photofont a spin.</div>

One letter for always - isn't that type design for you?
We might as well all give up and just use Times Roman for all lettering everywhere.
This not intended to replace Lettercarving, it will be an addition to the huge range of expressive options available. It may even inspire the commissioning of a piece of original carving.
Stone veining, I hope, will happen by having some translucency to the letters which will allow the markings of the background show through, but only slightly. This will look similar to what happens when actually carving. The polishing or honing of a surface brings out the natural veining of a piece of stone. The veining reduces down in the areas that are carved.
Opentype - definitely. Ligatures aplenty.
Other handiwork - Beautifully drawn and carved letters for a start.
Any other ideas welcome.
