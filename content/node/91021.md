  Fontographer and DTP opened up type design to the crowd, but the result was wild
  and crazy invention. A lot of it was sloppy and amateurish, but at least it was
  original.\r\nNow web fonts is virgin territory, but the crowd has responded with
  little in the way of innovation.\r\nLet\u2019s hope this is just a phase, and the
  participants up their game pronto.\r\nIf not, Google may become an object of designer
  derision, as Microsoft has long been."

    and talk about fonts in a way that wasn\u2019t about hinting, readability science
    or EULAs, but about type design. I had a feeling I was going to get into trouble\u2026)
    \r\n\r\nI took a closer look at Alegreya, starting with the Roman.\r\n\r\nImmediately,
    I was reminded of Mendoza (1991), by the cut of the bowl of the \u201Ca\u201D,
    the absence of a centre serif in \u201CE\u201D, the low contrast, the heft of
    the serifs, and the general proportions\u2014a combination of qualities which
    I had remembered as a matched package in Mendoza.\r\n\r\nSo I compared the two,
    and I believe my general contention about Google Fonts is confirmed by this example,
    because although Alegreya is a quite different typeface, with more lively drawing,
    more demonstrative serifs, and a slight tilt, it is in the same vein as Mendoza,
    an hommage perhaps.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not criticizing this or any other face in
    particular for having a precedent, just observing that so far, in toto, Google
    Fonts are a conservative bunch of designs. And I wondered how much the method
    by which they have been sourced has to do with that. \r\n\r\n"

    in some way. And how would you define a progressive type? Haven't all the new,
    interesting things already been done before? Even many of the Fontfont's, sure,
    progressive in their \"day\", (though not long ago) are now quite conservative
    looking.\r\n\r\nThe conservative quality is indeed evident in the appearance of
    most of Google's collection. That extends beyond even the appearance, to the features
    themselves. And perhaps that is in part to be blamed on the nature of a webfont\u2014throwing
    in a bunch of interesting Opentype features seems tentative at the moment. I think
    perhaps the method in which they are sourced could be indeed to blame, at least
    partly.\r\n\r\nWhat would you say would be a better approach for Google webfonts?
    Is it a problem of ingenuity or something else?\r\n\r\nBut what is truly \"pushing
    forward\" verses following trends in type design? Should political and social
    movements influence type? And to what extent? (and is this straying to far off
    topic? should we create another thread just for that question?) \r\n\r\nEdit:

    Although I think Typekit has them, which is a blessing. There are some Baskervilles,
    I think. Such as Open Baskerville, and some typefaces in the Didot theme. But
    I don't think GWF has anything like Caledonia. However I would much prefer to
    see a new design that evokes some feeling of that classic than a straight-up copy.
    Unless there was something that copy added, like a return to proportions that
    other digital versions miss, or an interpretation that takes a different route.
    (And it should probably cite its sources.)"

  body: In part because of the poor quality of many of the wacky early 90s display
    fonts, conservative type has come to be STRONGLY associated with quality. Therefore
    the type choices made by the people who select fonts for inclusion into Google
    Web Fonts probably tend towards the conservative. Also, many fonts on GWS are
    funded by Kickstarter and similar donation schemes. In general, more people are
    going to donate to a solid but unoriginal font that they can make lots of use
    of across many contexts than they are to donate to a project seeking to make a
    wild display face that will probably never get used by anyone over the age of
    10 or so...
