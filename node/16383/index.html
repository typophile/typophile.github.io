		<div class="commentbody">Geez, it's been so long since I've done any real handwork, it's hard to remember, but...

I was seriously into Rapidographs, with a complete range from 6x0 (about a gnat's eyelash in width) to 6 (used about a half bottle of ink for every twenty feet ruled); two Rapidograph ruling compasses (a small drop compass, which handled radii down to a sixteenth of an inch, and a large, far more precise one with worm-gear adjustment that could tackle radii to about four inches); a free-flowing India ink (whose name I cannot recall, but decidedly necessary for very fine-point pens); and Linekote illustration board. Both Rapidograph compasses had leadholder inserts, so you could use non-repro blue lead to plan your work, then swap out the appropriate penpoint to work your plan.

Another handy tool was white mylar tape for corrections and adding traps. The mylar version was much thinner than regular white tape (fewer problems with shadows), and a lot tougher (you could cut VERY tiny slivers for traps). And, of course, a whole slew of Alvin templates often came in handy.</div>

The most useful addition to my analogue toolkit this year has been an Osmiroid copperplate nib. This is a discontinued item, but I found a couple on eBay. It is, as far as I know, the only split-nib attachment available for a cartridge pen, and it much more convenient than getting out the pot of ink and my various old nibs and holders.</div>

The thought for this post occurred to me when I recently had to buy a collection of art supplies for a sick friend, and was faced with buying a cheap but comprehensive collection of tools at the art supply store. Kind of a "desert island drawing tool kit." 

Maybe a more interesting question is "does anyone use any anachronistic drawing tools?" Things like extinct lettering pens, obscure types of pencils, or <a href="http://www.cthruruler.com/prod_img/ALG-1.jpg">these</a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">When I'm not working at my computer, I like working with any of these, depending on what I'm doing:

Pilot Precise Extra Fine Roller Ball Pen
No. 2 Pencil
Faber-Castell 9000 Pencil Set (for more serious drawing)
Faber-Castell Magic Rub Eraser
Pilot Razor Point
Yellow legal pad (I love doodling on these things more than anything for some reason)
Bienfang 10x10 gridded paper
Gaebel steel 18" ruler
Various sized plastic triangles
Drafting tape
X-acto knife and blades
Mechanical pencil (no favorite brand right now, so long as it has an eraser and uses .05 HB leads)
Various drawing paper sketch books
Cheap little note pads (I always carry one of these)
Vidalon Translucent Vellum pad
Electric pencil sharpener

After watching the movie "Crumb" a couple of years ago, I noticed he uses a "2" Rapidograph pen for most of his work. I got all nostalgic and went out and got one. I used it for a couple of weeks, carried it around for a couple of months and now the damn thing is sitting with my other pens full of dry ink. Oh well.

I still like using pencils and paper, but I would never go back to producing finished lettering art with ink and pens. I actually used a ruling pen for a little while before I discovered Rapidographs. Ruling pens were heartbreakers. I also used to use a lot of red Zipatone instead of ink for filling in large areas. Plus a ton of ellipse and circle templates and french curves. (What do they call french curves in France? Des courbes? I guess if we were still using them here, some people would be calling them "freedom curves." :-P )

Oh, and I still have the T-square I bought in college. Nowadays, I am most likely to use it to retrieve our cat's toys from under furniture.</div>

That's the reason that an <strong>ultrasonic cleaner</strong> was also an essential tool in the analog days. The chemistry profs at the college I worked at eons ago said "old soapy water" greatly increased the efficacy of the cavitation produced by an ultrasonic cleaner, and made it more effective. However, I was never sure whether or not that meant that you had to add old soap to new water, or that you added new soap to new water and let it age. Vintage two-and-a-half months ago: a very good year?</div>

I've never had a pencil peel on me. Maybe they've improved the formula? Time to head back to your local Koh-I-Noor distributor...

The spin of the drop-bow as I fling it through its paces drawing hundreds of small circles on a map illustration; five layers of amberlith with hand cut trapping separating shades of color...Those were the days my friend I hoped they'd never end---NOT!!!

		<div class="commentbody">To be fair, the only things I use from the original list with regularity are the sketchbook, pencil/sharpener, metal ruler, and the bic pen. I used to be into pilot razor points, but when I had one explode on me I switched to staedtler triplus fineliners.

The rapidographs and steel pens are 1/2 tool fetishism (gearism?), and 1/2 practical. Something about using tools like this forces you to consider the marks you make on paper. There is a deliberation to each penstroke... but then, at the same time the carefulness can sometimes kill the spontenaity of sketches. I also like the quality of the india on paper. It doesn't bleed like felt tips, is completely opaque, and (depending on technique) doesn't make indents on the paper.

The most obscure tool I actually use is a "Wrico lettering pen" (#6), but it's messy, and I find that I spend more time with preparation and clean-up then I do with drawing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Lately it consists of:
 Koh-I-Noor technical pencils, 2H and 4H leads
 Koh-I-Noor Rapidomatic pencil
 Sanford Uniball ExtraFine pen
 Sharpie ExtraFine
 Sharpie Fine
 Prismacolor Black marker with Fine and Broad tips
 Prismacolor markers, various colors
 Pilot SuperColor Fine in black
 Marvy Uchica Calligraphy marker
 Kuretake Calligraphy marker
 Bienfang Parchment paper
 Bienfang Satin Design paper

I quit using Rapidograph pens over a decade ago, hated the things. I still occasionally use calligraphy pens, but Iike the feel of the marker better. Still looking for a really black marker though. Quit using french and ships curves for the most part.
The Bienfang paper is okay, but I had a noname tracing paper I got at Favor Ruhl in Chicago. It was between the parchment and satin design in weight, nice surface and very strong. Favor Ruhl went under sometime between 75-80 I think and my brother and I bought all we could get our hands on. The manufacturer quit making tracing paper and I used up the last of it about two years ago.

		<div class="commentbody">I saw Amberlith and Rubylith in posts by Carl and ChrisL, so I thought I'd mention my indispensible tool.

The stencil knife. Just a piece of 3mm stainless steel rod about eight inches long, ground flat at one end and sharpened at about 45°.

The great advantage when hand-cutting is the ability to rotate the blade as you cut, when held almost vertically between forefinger and thumb.

I don't cut much by hand these days, but still use it all the time to weed out computer-cut ruby and self-adhesive vinyl.

Nothing to do with typography, I'm afraid, but I'm just a crude screen printer and sign maker really!
