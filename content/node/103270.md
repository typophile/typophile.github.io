body: "Rolls is a typeface designed by Georg Salden. It belongs to the Eurostile font
  style. But what\u2019s really interesting is the rather calligraphic italic, which
  forms a great contrast to the angular upright. Salden himself said that Rolls is
  one of his few typefaces that also can be slanted automatically. But only this gentle
  and zestful italic unfolds its charm.\r\n\r\nMore [[http://www.typemanufactur.com/eng/fonts/rolls/overview.html|here]]
