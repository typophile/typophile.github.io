body: "I never really noticed this before, but in last week or so I've seen it a few
  times.\r\n\r\nEmigre's Tribute was used in a magazine I read recently, that's when
  I got interested for the first time.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.emigre.com/fontpage.php?STrbR.html\r\n\r\nThen
  in the Best of Finnish advertising and graphic design exhibition there was one new
  font, Eero Astala's Oksa for Luonto-Liitto, and the M was there, too.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.grafia.fi/index.php?sid=1208591950efd28cd2972a8109d5e215579ad7ff66&rand=1119068881&article_id=10926&__from_id__=8007&__variableName__=sarja&profile1=42196&search_type=article_search&source_id=10479&variableSearch=1.+Graafinen+muotoilu\r\n\r\nIs
  this kind of M common, and what's the history of it? Can you name other fonts with
  M with single left facing serif?\r\n\r\nSorry about missing pictures, upload didn't
  work."

  body: "a bit of history: this form of M can be found in the <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/fermello78/483904480/\">De
    Aetna</a> typeface (the same typeface that Bembo was modelled on), and if I'm
    not mistaken, engraved in some of the classical Roman inscriptions. I'll have
    to research both those leads a bit better...\r\nJames Mosley would be able to
    give a much better answer to this question."

    in Emigre Tribute Roman).

    more like an oddity, as it's not very common?\r\n\r\nAszszelp, I agree with the
    ugliness of that N."
