  cell phone.\r\n\r\nToo me, it looks almost like Rockwell, but even bolder than Rockwell
  Extra Bold, and on the \"NEXT\" image, the slab parts on the E hang down much lower
  than in Rockwell, and the X seems more condensed than a Rockwell X. \r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "Awesome. thanks a bunch! \r\n\r\nQuick question...\r\n\r\nIt seems to be
    Ziggurat as you stated Chipman, but i'm trying to figure out how two different
    foundries can have two typefaces that are really really similar. Of course I am
    saying that because I am a novice typophile. I can stroll by a sign and tell the
    difference between Helvetica/Univers/Akzidenz-Grotesk, but is it not wrong to
    say that Giza and Ziggurat are damn close to each other? \r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks
    again, you guys always answer back quick.\r\n\r\nOH YEAH! I was just accepted
    to Art Center in Pasadena last week too, yay, i'm excited!"

  body: "Both typefaces have a common source - Egyptian types from the early 1800s
    - so it would make sense that they look very close.\r\n\r\nThe difference is that
    Ziggurat was intended to work with its brothers, Leviathan, Acropolis, and Saracen
    so you can get different flavours with the same skeleton.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S.
    Mmm... skeletons."

  body: "Correct me if I'm wrong, wasn't the proteus  project (those four from lex)
    designed originally for rolling stone? It's a huge time-saver for production without
    having to sacrifice \xE6sthetics.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia:\r\nA ziggurat (Akkadian
    ziqqurrat, D-stem of zaq\u0101ru \"to build on a raised area\") was a temple tower
    of the ancient Mesopotamian valley and Iran, having the form of a terraced pyramid
    of successively receding stories or levels.\r\n\r\nWe all know the great pyramids
    are in Giza, so even the names are in the same family.\r\n\r\nThere are other
    similarly close typefaces, some probably closer than Giza and Ziggurat. Next time
    you can, you should overlay Swiss 721 on top of Helvetica. If you look through
    the threads, you'll find a lot on the subject, and how vague intellectual property
    gets."
