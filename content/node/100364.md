body: "Hello all,\r\nI am looking for a font similar to this writing on a 2012 Bergdorf
  Goodman shopping bag. This looks handwritten to me, but I would be so grateful if
  anyone could point me in the direction of a similar looking script, and if possible
  where to purchase/download it.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
