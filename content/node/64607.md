  body: "Wow.\r\n\r\nThank you so much Florian, most of those listed are great but
    not quite what I was after.\r\nPan Am however I shall have to be purchasing as
    that will look the closest to the original. I'm re-creating the artwork for a
    re-issue of the CD and as such I've had to create everything from scratch the
    old artwork is lost.\r\n\r\nMuch thanks\r\nAgain"
