    href="http://discussions.apple.com/forum.jspa?forumID=777">see also</a>) from
    Apple is pretty darn powerful. I use it for internal business forms but know of
    people that use it for all sorts of publishing. I'd think the only drawback might
    be, for me anyway, the speed. But I'm on a granny old G4.

  body: "You could always try LaTex with one of the various GUIs out there...but the
    end-user revolt might cost more than licenses for Quark/Indesign. \r\n\r\nMiss
    Tiffany is right about Pages\u2014It's a pretty awesome hybrid word processor/page
    layout app, altho IMHO Indesign is easier to use and it would probably be less
    expensive to buy indesign than to teach users how to get into Pages. My problem
    with doing layout in pages is that it's a template-based word processor on steroids,
    so anything other than dumping text into templates or blank pages gets obtuse
    quickly."

  body: "Interesting stuff, thanks for the suggestions so far. Sorry, I probably should
    have specified we're a PC environment and most of the work that they'll be doing
    is proposals and contracts... nothing visually stimulating <em>or I'd be out of
    a job</em>\r\n\r\nI think they're looking for something MS Word but has a multiplage
    support and work flow similar to Indesign, just simplified. \r\n\r\nApparently,
    when you create multiple pages in Word and need to add  images or more text to
    a previous page, it pushes all the contents down to create room. This puts kinks
    up the work flow. Since I rarely use Word, I wasn't aware of this issue. I'm currently
    using InDesign for all my multiple page needs. \r\n\r\nTo recap:\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2022
    Desktop publishing with multiple page support and a per page work flow system
    that could run on a server in a PC environment.</strong>\r\n\r\nThis might make
    finding an applicable application a bit more difficult."

  body: "I wrote a fair amount on this and then managed to close the window, so will
    have to be a bit terse:\r\n\r\nWhen you mention the system being server-based,
    are you implying simultaneous editing/version control? \r\n\r\nIf so, requirement
    might come under the heading of Content Management systems rather than DTP, and
    I think you'll struggle to find anything that could be decribed as cheap.\r\n\r\nIf
    not what's the stress on being server based?\r\n\r\nWord is often used, particularly
    in house, for simple DTP and can produce professional results for certain kinds
    of docs, but you and your docs have to live with the single text stream approach,
    not worth trying to work round.\r\n\r\nIs the page-based workflow really required?\r\n\r\nCould
    you build single pages in Word and then collate (in Word or PDF)?\r\n\r\nPowerpoint
    is of course page based. Not suggesting it for anything that isn't bullet points,
    but people do use it for all sorts of things, believe me - be ready with your
    arguments."
