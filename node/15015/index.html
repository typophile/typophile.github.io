<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This question goes out to the governing bodies of Typophile.
Eben Sorkin, Bruce Herbert and moi have been discussing the possibility of creating a Flash "game" (exercise is a better term) that would roughly simulate the ancient task of composing hand-set type, hence the name "<a href=http://typophile.com/node/14525>Upside Down & Backwards</a>."
This is one of a few educational or entertaining projects under discussion that might be of interest to design educators and graphic design students alike.
When the project is finally completed, we would like to make it openly available for download from the <a href=http://typophile.com/forum/16>Typographic Edumacators</a> section (a sadly under utilized topic area). The participants in the project look only for a credit line or such and want to know if Typophile is interested in holding the copyrights or intellectual property. I've noticed that the page footer declares "© 2000-2005 Typophile, All Rights Reserved. Typophile is a Punchcut gig."
Questions:
-- Is the Typophile organization interested in hosting such projects?
-- Is the Typophile organization a legal entity that can hold a copyright?
-- Can we start some dialog on these issues before we procede any further?
We can follow up via email instead of through this topic if preferred.
Thanks.

<div class=commentbody>Hello Ahmad,
thanks for your interest. We are just starting to get organized and you can visit the "<a href=http://typophile.com/node/14525 target=new>Upside Down & Backwards</a>" topic and join in the dialog.
Little by little we (meaning any interested Typophile member) hope to expand the <a href=http://typophile.com/forum/16 target=new><strong>Typographic Edumacators</strong></a> section to include more topics, suggestions, curriculum and projects related to and helpful for educating design students about type and typography.
Any and all interested members are welcomed to contribute and participate!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nortbert:
On the subject of copyright: Why would the creators wish to transfer rights to Typophile? Also, you dont have to be a legal entity to retain copy rights.
If for some strange reason you wanted to transfer IP and rights to Typophile (which most likeley would either be Punchcut, or one or more of its owners), Typophile would comission 'work for hire', and the designers/developers would transfer all rights to them through this work for hire contract.
I have a good amount of knowledge in the legality of copy rights and trademark law. Let me know if I can clarify anything.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I thought of Typophile since there may be several individuals participating on the project, and no individual in the group should have a greater share of intellectual property rights.
Also, creating content and projects which can be hosted, distributed or downloaded from Typophile may eventually raise awareness of the organization as an educational resource beyond Forum topics and content.
This is just a thought which is open for debate. In previous threads there seemed to be interest in expanding the Typography Edumacators area into such a resource.

Look again, Dan.

I realize that Typophile is still in beta, so that's fine. Once a Projects area is back on line then we can move whatever has been developed there. I still would like to see the Typography Edumacators topic area grow.

<div class=commentbody>The <em>Edumacators</em> term was debated briefly before. The 'joke' term is basically vintage Americana isn't it? -- and derrogatory as well. It seems to be the "rage" term used in blogs if you Google 'edumacation.'
I had a little difficulty explaining the term to a Belgian who may be interested in participating. Anyway, I leave it to Nos. 1 and 2 to figure it out.

<div class=commentbody>Norbert,
Yes, we would love to host content produced by the community and we're committed to making it available as a free resource. In the past we've hosted 2 online courses that [[Jonathan Hoefler]] developed for Yale and that were built out in Flash by [[Jared Benson]] (pre-[[Punchcut]]).
I think it would be more natural for the creators to hold the copyright, but a creative commons approach is worth looking into. Kyle, your input about IP is more than welcome here.
Why don't we discuss this further via email... typophile[at]punchcut.com.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>"the only items not covered/protected by the Forum’s copyright"</em>
What exactly do you mean by that? What is it that we are worried about? Typophile doesn't own our words -- we do. But by posting here, you do give typophile rights to republish the words you have posted.
The Typophile copyright/usage rights policy seems to be non existant right now. I would like to eventually see a privacy policy too.

<div class=commentbody>Kyle, the reason the topic of copyright protection came up in the first place is that I was inquiring about the possibility of Typophile holding the copyright on a project a few of us proposed. I guess there are several solutions to that.
I'm not worrying that Typophile automatically confiscates content posted or contributed by its members. That just ain't gonna happen!
Unfortunately, there are many large companies that have employees sign over any and all rights to intellectual property developed or conceived while in employment of that company.
So if you work on the assembly line at General Motors and your wife's recipe for macadamia nut cookies becomes highly popular, GM holds the right of intellectual property plus the right to market it and profit from your wife's cookies!

<div class=commentbody>There is no "by doing blah, you are agreeing to blah" statements here, so I don't think that IP is an issue as far as our words are concerned. We are not engaged in any emplyment either, our brains are not being paid for, so any ideas that we may com up with are our own. If it came to hosting a project, then that may be a different matter, because there would be money changing hands. If we were paid up members (which I am yet...waiting tho) then we would be sharing the cost of the hosting, which would change things too.
The original proposal was to actually investigate letting the FORUM have the rights, which is kind of different to where the thread was heading. I guess then what would need to happen is to ensure that it was indeed accessible to all, and that people involved got due credit for their work. I for one am happy to go into it knowing full well that I am relinquishing my rights to IP on the previso that it remains open to everyone, and that my name is on it saying what I did. But I am not actually sure if I need to sign anything over, we just say, here it is everyone, oh, and by the way if you use it, just remember to credit us. And any cash if fine too.
If it turns out that someone decides to turn it into a commercial product, with or without our knowledge, then that's something else again. It's a risk I don't mind taking. After all, it's what opensource is built on.
OK, end of rant.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Before the relaunch, there was a clear statement saying the author of posts and of content retains the rights but that posting here grants Typophile permission to reproduce content for materials that would directly promote Typophile (and not any other entity). That content lived on the About page, which got (inappropriately) nixed in the redesign. Look for a notice about this soon.
Despite the notion of granting permission by default, to date we have only used people's content generated here (words and images) with their verbal or written (usually email) permission.
I think any forum or blog would have a very difficult time in a court trying to say that it held exclusive rights to intellectual property posted in forum discussions or as comments to articles. Likewise though, I have heard of cases of forums being sued for comments that users make there -- as if the forum controls and is responsible for user input. That notion is being heavily challenged in court though.</div>

I realise this is getting off topic but surely the usual wording is "...developed in the course of your employment..." -- ie while actually at work?
(However, my last 3 employers have required written permission from senior management to undertake any other work, paid or unpaid. In a fit of bloodymindedness I wrote to a previous CEO to ask him to grant me permission to redesign my father's webpage. Which he granted.)

<div class=commentbody>The other issue which came up on the other thread - and which has not been addressed here so far is : Would the 'entity' Typophile be interested in being associated with the project Norbert proposed? Or even with other projects. I expect the answer is probably something like 'maybe' because Joe will & Jared want the thing to not suck first.
Still, I was wondering what initial thoughts you guys might have about this kind of community project & Typophile 'affiliation' with it.
The rest of this is all inferable or explicet from the other thread but here is my recap anyway:
Nortbert thinks ( Norbert, please correct this if it is false ) that the reverse type project would be good education for typophiles in general because it would help them to see shapes better. And because this form of thinking about type has historical interest.
If Typophile is seen to agree through affiliation with the project, the project is more likely to be used and by more people. Also I think Norbert would like to see the project made available to both Typophiles and Conference Attendees. Affiliation might be helpful there too.</div>

A "game" proposed by several members of Typophile to help graphic art students to improve letterform recognition. The above topic link outlines issues in detail. (contributors -- Eben Sorkin, Bruce Herbert)
<em><strong>Innovativations in Type Education</strong></em>
Andi Emery et moi have made personal commitments to expand the <a href=http://typophile.com/forum/16>Typographic Edumacators</a> topic area by generating curriculum exercises and ideas, and by inviting other educators to participate, contribute and suggest useful and innovative approaches to type education.
<em><strong>Who's In Charge Here?</strong></em>
The current topic you are in which raises the possibility of the Typophile site being used for distribution of developed educational material as described above.
The concern over rights of intellectual property has also been raised by members interested in developing content and projects for type education.
I will endeavor to keep these topics current with other members who have expressed interest in participating.

As an aside-topic, (being somewhat related to Flash, typography and learning) has anyone seen this?

<div class=commentbody>Thanks, Paul for the link.
Just launched it for a few minutes but it already seems outrageously wonderful! I did "I" for Ibis... way cool.
I'll dig deeper into it later.
