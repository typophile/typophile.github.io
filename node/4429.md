  body: I think you&#39;re basically right -- my guess is that it&#39;s a condensed
    Cooper Black Italic with swashes. All the letterforms match pretty well, but I
    don&#39;t know what the swashes look like. Mark will know.

  body: Well, it&#39;s not Cooper Black Italic. The x-height is too low and the swash
    M and F do not match at all. My guess is that this is custom letteriing inspired
    by Cooper Black Italic. It also looks like it&#39;s been around for a while &#40;&#39;60s
    or &#39;70s&#41;.
