body: Does anyone have any links or recommendations on indepth analysis of the fonts
  of Neville Brody? There is alot out there about his use of type but I am looking
  for analysis of his type designs (the inspirations, methods of production, indepth
  look at particular letterforms, etc). I have his two monographs and have trawled
  the font bureau websites already...

    of the political synechdote in the constructedness of Brody's faces?\r\n"

  body: "\"Is Industria also informed by constructivism?...\r\n\r\nHaving been at
    a couple of his presentations and talked to him afterwards, it seemed that Nevile
    Brody rather overtly identified with the political zeitgeist of the 70s and 80s.
    I'd be surprised if constructivism weren't an influence for Industria as well
    as some of his other faces. For a designer of his profile, it is surprising that
    there aren't that many good studies online. \r\n\r\n\"Gorbachev, perestroika...\"\r\nI'm
    not so aware of the particular influences of these on graphic design. Nick, I'd
    be grateful for any elaboration. "

  body: The Soviet Union was opening up and in the news, provoking interest in things
    Russian.  Constructivism was seen to represent an attractive formalism for the
    anti-Thatcher counterculture, superceding the revolutionary chaos of punk.

    of this influence?

  body: "Insignia and Industria were done before FB got involved, but FF Blur, FF
    Typeface 6 and 7, FF World, FF Gothic, FF Tokyo, FF Typeface 4, and FF Pop were
    all developed with inspiration from logos and simple display faces made for NB's
    clients.  Methods of production were standard for this kind of work, with Brody
    providing T. Frere-Jones and myself with the existing work, we grew the glyph
    set to standard, separated various ideas engulfed in the designs into styles and
    weights that others could use, and bounced  particular letterforms across the
    sea. What started as 4-5 styles, ended with 10-12. Later, when all the main tasks
    were done, TFJ and I went to Berlin, finalized most of the details with NB and
    then the works were manufactured at FF and released. Blur was slightly different,
    with TFJ working on that with NB solo, mostly to establish some spacing that worked.
    \r\n\r\nI have not seen the monographs, what do they say?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"

    for Industria.
