  ID of the attached. Probably part or all is hand-drawn but maybe it is recognized
  or there's something very similar. Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/ta_logo_5646.png]

  body: "The triangular serifs are a Latin attribute, and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/latin-ct/|this
    font]] from CastleType is a representative Latin. I think the swashy letters were
    customized. (Possibly Letterhead Fonts, may have a Latin style with swashes, but
    I can't recall one for sure.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
