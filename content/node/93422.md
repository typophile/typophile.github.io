  up a blank every time. \r\n\r\nDo you guys have any clue what it may be. I pulled
  the image from a sun-strip on a car wind shield so the image is a little distorted
  but I think its clear enough for you to get the idea. \r\n\r\nThanks for taking
  the time to have a look at this. Good luck !\r\n"
