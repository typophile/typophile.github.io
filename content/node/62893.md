  body: 'In my humble opinion, the linking part (name?) is either too thin on the
    S or too wide on the t (in other words : either linking too much on one side,
    not enough on the other). Have a look at Parisine plus for a good example of how
    to solve that problem - there might even be a Parisine Plus Italique/Italic.'

  body: I think this logo would be far stronger without the ligature. It's a bit forced
    and unnecessary and Caecilia has enough interest on its own without the modification.
    My compliments on your typeface choice. Just keep it simple and concentrate on
    the symbol/imagery surrounding the logotype.
