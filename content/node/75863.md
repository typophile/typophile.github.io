body: "   Being my very first real life brief I was quiet excited to start this work,
  since I have only just entered my 2nd year on my university course.\r\n   The brief
  was to create a logo design for a newly invented slash proof material, which is
  better than Kevlar, tested and proven. We had to bare in mind 4 key words, being;
  Protection, Safety, Innovative and Futuristic, also we had to make sure the design
  could still be easily recognisable on a smaller scale e.g. clothes label size, since
  that is where the logo will be seen most of the time.\r\n   We got the presentation
  delivered to us by 1 of the 4 owners of SARK Technology, which seemed pretty standard,
  I took notes, like you do and found myself accidentally stumbling across an idea
  half way through the presentation from the sketch he has produced showing what his
  slash proof material looked like in its molecular form. I tried not to think to
  much about my design once the presentation was finished as I still needed to research
  to give me more ideas. After some researching I soon fell back to the original rough
  design annoyingly, so I did a quick computerised version on Illustrator to see if
  it really would work. It didn't, the main part did, but the extra parts (probably
  would remove them from further development anyway) didn't work very well, therefore
  ruining the whole design. So I went back to researching happily to find and create
  better design ideas.\r\n\r\n(Image attached; The idea I came up with during the
  presentation, in computerised form)"
