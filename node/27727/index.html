So like most things typographical, the trick is to get to know the typefaces you work with, and experiment to produce the best setting.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, if you&rsquo;re thinking about using an em dash and not quite sure about how it will work out for a particular setting, use the en-dash with a space either side instead.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick - beg to differ. As in the primer, the em and en dashes have very different functions, and should not be used interchangeably or have spaces around them. The en is a connecting dash; it represents a span of time or space. The em is a separating dash—to set apart a thought or idea. I do find that in some cases the em in particular is kerned too tight, but you can adjust those in the kerning tables (and I do).</div>

<p>Contrary to the P22 primer, the europeans generally use spaces (sometimes thin spaces) on either side of dashes, and I prefer it. No space creates visual tension for me. Many fonts need the room to breathe. As Nick said, all of this depends on the font, as some dashes are longer than others and some have sidebearings with space, some do not.</p>

<p>As we have all noted there is a lot of variety in size of dashes but that&rsquo;s no excuse for poor typesetting. I do kern a little extra space around an em if it&rsquo;s too tight, which they often are. And yes it&rsquo;s cool to horizontally scale the dashes a bit to suit your taste, I&rsquo;ve even created style sheets just for dashes.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Patty, I recommend &ldquo;space - en dash - space&rdquo; for practical reasons, because as I said, emdash treatment varies so widely with typeface. For instance, this Futura em dash is really nasty, with no sidebearings and a long way from the vertical centre of the x-height. This is the kind of situation where &ldquo;following the rules&rdquo; will cause a typographer to do stuff which looks clumsy.
On the other hand, Electra&rsquo;s em dash has plenty of sidebearings, i.e. built-in spaces. No trouble there, but &ldquo;space - en dash - space doesn&rsquo;t look bad either, so that setting works in both fonts.
<img src="/images/old-images/Dash2_3468.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For more experienced typographers, I would agree with you that the old school emdash with no added space is ideal, but may require nuancing, such as inserting some manual kerning or hair space, and maybe baseline shift, depending on the font and the typographer&rsquo;s taste.</p>

<p>I am a stickler but also realize that the average Joe doesn&rsquo;t even know the difference. Of course the average Joe doesn&rsquo;t look at the front and back cover of a book together to notice how nicely you&rsquo;ve balanced and lined up the various elements either. And wouldn&rsquo;t care that the fractions weren&rsquo;t converted or whether there were prime marks instead of smart quotes. Typesetting is a lonely business but I come from book publishing, where this kind of thing matters. And I&rsquo;m not dumbing down for the average Joe.</p>
<p>On a similar note, what is the deal with ellipses? There&rsquo;s a keystroke for them (option semicolon) but when I get a manuscript it&rsquo;s always space-period-space-period-space-period. Then you have to deal with line breaks, etc. What is up with that????</p>

He argues for the n dash with spaces as better because it puts less of a hole in the text. I think he&rsquo;s right, but many fonts now are doing &lsquo;em dashes&rsquo; less than an em, with spaces.

<p>what do the Brits do for dates</p>

<p>I just looked back at Bringhurst, which I got not quite accurate from memory. He says the m-dash for a &lsquo;phrase marker&rsquo; is &lsquo;Victorian&rsquo;. He says, &ldquo;Like the oversized space between sentences, it belongs to the padded and corsetted aesthetic of Victorian Typography.&rdquo; I remember the use of the spaced n-dash from my years in England, and it is part of Tschichold&rsquo;s recommended style for Penguin. I suspect it is in other English style books, but I don&rsquo;t have any on hand.</p>
<p>For dates, Bringhurst recommends en dashes without spaces, as is also American style, eg. in the Chicago Manual of Style.</p>
<p>If I remember rightly from earlier Typophile discussions, Matthew Carter came up with the idea of three-quarter em dashes with spaces out to the em. Being a &lsquo;mid Atlantic&rsquo; kind of guy, I guess this is apt. I think it is probably the best solution. Kent Lew wrote that in Whitman he did the Carter-style em dashes and also negatively kerned them so if keyed in successively they make a solid line.</p>

This is nice, from 1940.
I believe it was written, or edited, with typographic appearance in mind.
There seems to be a variety of marks used for subordinate clauses:
-commas
-brackets (parentheses)
-dashes
The variety animates the setting, along with frequent paragraph breaks and italicization.
Dashes are used more often with quotations, perhaps to contrast with the quote marks themselves, whereas brackets are favoured for the author&rsquo;s text.</p>
<p>The dashes are narrow and the word spaces wide, compared with how it would usually be done today*, but as has been mentioned, the main thing is to find your style and be consistent &ndash; readers will &ldquo;get&rdquo; it pretty quickly, because that&rsquo;s the kind of adjustment they make all the time, reading material as diverse as newspapers, magazines, books, advertisements, etc. So no need to dull down to some conservative ideal of what&rsquo;s considered most readable.</p>

<p>I use an en dash to indicate a range, sometimes with a space, sometimes not (eg Mon–Fri, 9–5pm; 4 September – 5 October), depending on if the &lsquo;ranged&rsquo; items also have spaces within them.</p>
<p>In extended text, I like the em-dash with hair spaces either side to indicate the change-of-thought. Although some editors that we use think that is an old-style approach and prefer spaced ens instead.</p>
<p>eliason - I think the difference in space between the dots within an ellipsis and a period that follows makes sense. Otherwise, it would look like an ellipsis with four dots? I&rsquo;d even go so far as to insert a thin space to make the difference noticeable.</p>

<p>Tim: The point of the em dash is exactly that: to add a big gap. It represents a gap in thinking, a change in thought. I happen to like the width of the em in this font (Mercury is it?) It&rsquo;s too bad when it&rsquo;s either disproportionately wide or kerned too tight but those can be adjusted and should.</p>

But surely an experienced reader would use a comma or semi colon in the same way, for example in Nick’s print example I find it difficult to explain why the em dashes are used when a comma could do the same job, I don&rsquo;t really need to see the pause quite so forcefully.

<p>True, but it also does its own thing. The colon and parenthesis are short and vertical, whereas the length of the em dash &ndash; imagine oneself writing it &ndash; provides urgency and continuity.</p>
<p>Dashes are also visual design elements, look at the symmetry and shape of:
&ldquo;All right, boys&ndash;that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much more attractive than:
&ldquo;All right, boys: that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">that&rsquo;s all very interesting, i wasn&rsquo;t aware that there were cultural/national differences in usage of en-/em-dash.
I can only comment/add on the ‘traditional’ usage in germany:
the m-dash aka „Streckenstrich“ (something along the lines of ‘distance-stroke’) was to be used to designate a distance/span of time and space like „10—12 km“/„12—14.00 Uhr“; or to be used in amounts of money with no digits like „10,— Mark“. The interesting thing is that you almost never see it being used today, i suspect exactly because it is deemed too long, as stated above. When used, you rarely see it without small 1/8th- to 1/4th-em spaces over here.
Seeing the em-dash in use as described today to me makes quite a traditional, if not ‘reactionary’ impression, like using the st-ligature in body copy, if you get my drift; but of course it depends on the typeface being used, context, etc. I find the en-dash sufficient in most cases.
Apparently there is no reliable rule of thumb to be found here, as the design of both dashes varies too much from typeface to typeface.</div>

<p>Surely that is why we have <em> search and replace </em> functions; I never yet had an author&rsquo;s MS supplied that didn&rsquo;t require hours of tidying up prior to it being typeset… much of it is just about old typist&rsquo;s conventions.</p>
<p>There was a really fine post by Jason Dewinetz just over a year ago at
<a href="http://typophile.com/node/12883">http://typophile.com/node/12883</a> which might make good related reading to this thread.</p>

Well ALT then alright.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not at all sure where you get this from, Patty; all the Brit typos I know would be horrified by the absence of para indenting. As Cameron points out, plenty of (Brit) typesetting convention still persists in Australia (and New Zealand). In a situation where there is no indent, then surely there is a line break, an outdent, a pilcrow or a drop cap or some other method of signalling the para break, no?</p>
<p>As for the Europeans, I just can&rsquo;t imagine the likes of Spiekermann, Noordzij, Porchez et al really trying to make it hard for the reader to distinguish paragraphs.</p>

<blockquote>Algorithmic Shortcomings
<p>One situation in which quotes will get curled the wrong way is when apostrophes are used at the start of leading contractions. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;'Twas the night before Christmas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In the case above, SmartyPants will turn the apostrophe into an opening single-quote, when in fact it should be a closing one. I don’t think this problem can be solved in the general case — every word processor I’ve tried gets this wrong as well. In such cases, it’s best to use the proper HTML entity for closing single-quotes (’ or ’) by hand.</blockquote></p>

The guess may sometimes turn out to be wrong, but in most cases &ndash; as in this one &ndash; it will be correct.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m a little disconcerted by the repeated challenges. I did say that the parsing can get tricky, and isn&rsquo;t currently perfect. It&rsquo;s easy to construct pathological cases that will trip up even the best of the current solutions. In practice, such cases occur very infrequently.)</p>

I&rsquo;m very interested in just how perfect such substitutions have to be, with regards to contextual alternates in OpenType. In particular, I&rsquo;m contemplating how to substitute the &ldquo;x&rdquo; by the multiply character.</p>
<p><em>the job is much easier for software like SmartyPants</em></p>
<p>However, if InDesign can incorporate Paragraph Composer, what you propose is of the same order.</p>

You can get the book for less than delivery cost at Amazon. I&rsquo;ve read it several times, Levant is such a great wit, and the insights into the creative workings of popular culture in the 20s and 30s are amazing.</div>

I have a collection spanning the &rsquo;50s, which I inherited from my father-in-law, so I&rsquo;ll take a look and see if I can dig up anything by him. With illustrations by Bemelmans, hopefully!</div>
