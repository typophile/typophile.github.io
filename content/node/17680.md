  body: "I am coming around to the opinion that this is a customized slab serif. I
    have looked at all the slabs I could find, and nothing is particularly close,
    with the angled slab serifs on the T, L and E. However, as a long time outline-tweaker,
    I can imagine that a font like Nick Curtis' <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/spaghetti-western-wbw/\">Spaghetti
    Western</a> could quickly be made to look like this just by moving the serif corners
    inward. I picked this font because it had no top serif on the A, and the K and
    E were the right kinds. (It's not that I'm promoting Nick today ;-))\r\n\r\n-
