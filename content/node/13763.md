body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Bouma</strong>\r\n\r\nBouma: a hypothesized
  visual-syntactic atom of immersive reading; almost always the blurry notan of a
  string of letters; usually the blurry outline of a single word in the parafovea.
  The term is a simplification of \"Bouma-shape\" as used by [[Insup Taylor]] and/or
  [[Paul Saenger]], derived from [[Herman Bouma]], a [retired] Dutch scientist.\r\n\r\nMost
  cognitive psychologists reject this hypothesized importance of the bouma in reading,
  immersive or otherwise. The dominant reading model in cognitive psychology is the
  parallel letterwise recognition model. Research experiments which would have different
  predicted outcomes for the two different theories have supported parallel letterwise
  recognition over the bouma theory.\r\n\r\nSee also: [[Notan]], [[Word Shape|word
