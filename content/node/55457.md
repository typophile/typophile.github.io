    of Graphic Design]] by Phillip Meggs is a standard and could be a starting point.\r\n\r\nFlush
    left/rag right would not be any more difficult than full justification whether
    in a manuscript or a printed document. I would imagine the flush right/ragged
    left came about with the invention of movable type. Lines set with movable type
    on a press bed can easily (relatively) be moved from left to right justification
    whereas a calligrapher would have had a difficult time knowing where to begin
    the lines of handwriting in order to end them at the same point. "
