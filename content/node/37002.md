  or an eszet, but I don't recall having seen a treatment of the rules -- or lack
  thereof -- for the archaic \"r\" in such blackletter texts as the [[http://www.lib.umich.edu/pap/exhibits/papyri_james/01_18.jpg
  |Great Bible]].\r\n\r\nI came across this glyph when I sought out [[http://www.bible-researcher.com/cranmer.html|Cranmer's
  Preface]] to the Great Bible, wherein the more familiar \"r\" glyph and the less
  familiar one seem to be mingled without a predictable rationale. Have my powers
  of inference failed me, or did typesetters use whatever came out of the font?"

    you were being picky you might object that in this kind of textura black letter
    lower case letters like b and d do not round off behind, but if the type maker
    says they do why should we make trouble? In more rounded gothic types the ragged
    r does in fact fit rather neatly behind these letters."

    about another typographical gesture with which I'd been unfamiliar before reading
    the \"Preface\" -- namely, the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde#Diacritical_use|diacritical
    use of a tilde]] to abbreviate a vowel-m or vowel-n construction. Was this solely
    a convenient abbreviation? Does it occur more often at some points than others?
    Why would such a conventional typographical device eventually die out?"

  body: "In English it's generally called an R-rotunda, at least, this is how I've
    always heard it refered to as.\r\n\r\nAs for the tilde, yes, in Spanish, at least,
    it was just an abbreviation.  Instead of using a hyphen, if they only needed a
    letter or two to fit everything on a line, then an, en, in, on, un, am, em, im,
    om, and um could be replaced by their respective vowel + ~.  As well, q+tilde
    could be used for the very common construction que.  For example in [[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/01338386411915161644680/7982_0097_s.jpg|this
    sonnet]], note the only two lines with tildes are the ones that extend to all
    the way to the right margin.  \"en\" appears in the first line, but has a tilde
    on the second (and vos veo loses some of its spacing too).  Ditto for \"que\"
    appearing in full on the 7th.  If you look at the italic script on some of the
    [[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/01338386411915161644680/7982_0101_s.jpg|other
    pages]], you'll notice the tilde looked more like an breve when it was italicised.\r\n\r\nSince
    nn was relatively common, it also got the tilde treatment.  Although I'm not as
    familiar with the Portuguese practice, I presume it to be relatively similar,
    and as time went on for both languages, the use for the tilde wasn't quite as
    great.  So in modern Spanish publishing it's never used, although in handwriting
    you'll occasionally see q's and c's using it for que and con respectively (although
    it's more likely to look the same as what's used for the acute, as this is how
    the n-tilde is writ by most Spanish-speakers I know).  The n-tilde stuck around
    because it came to be viewed not as much as an abbreviation, but as a separate
    letter since it had a completely different sound than before.  Presumably, for
    this reason the tilde is still used in Portuguese, where in a word that Spanish
    and Portuguese once shared like capitanes, the n was no longer pronounced in Portuguese
    and instead affected the vowel by causing nasality.  So, it's now writ capit\xE3es
    and represents a more unique sound.  Why it's not as used on the u or i, when
    those can still be nasalised, I don't know.\r\n\r\nIn any case, yet another use
    of the tilde was an all purpose abbreviator:\r\n<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/------/</code>\r\n<code>El
    exclntm\xBA se\xF1or Don Quixote de la Mancha.</code>\r\nWhere /------/ is one
    big long tilde.  I recall Cyrillic having a similarly formed, if not same semantically-speaking,
    character.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos damos
