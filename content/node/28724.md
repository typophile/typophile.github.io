  the cuts. i've checked myfonts, the underware-website and fontshop.de/.com, all
  only sell the whole package. is there any possibility to buy single weights/cuts?
  i cant believe they dont offer that..\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "probably, but the last time i mailed them it took them four days to answer,
    and my friend sounded like she was in a hurry.\r\n\r\nim not saying that even
    answering at all is a very nice thing - its just that i expect an answer here
    faster than by mailing them. but my friend knows this thread so i think she'll
    probably mail them directly if no other answer comes up."

  body: let me know if you or she (she or you?) get any response. i thought about
    mailing them about the same thing, i love the way that font looks and would really
    like buying even two or three faces i just cannot afford the whole set. maybe
    i would buy it in installments over a couple of years... is that a realistic option
    for any typefoundries?

      than the virus that enables the caps lock though, eh?"

  body: "Thierry,\r\nbon soir.\r\n\r\nWe are a proud distributor of Underware's brilliant
    typefaces. We have asked several times if they would consider selling single weights
    of their fonts. They have chosen to only license full families - Dolly and Sauna
    - or else families and partial sets - Auto and Fakir. The only Underware typeface
    which can be licensed as single fonts is Bello.\r\n\r\nWith many apologies to
    your friend, there is little chance that she will have luck with her request.\r\n\r\n"
