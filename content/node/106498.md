  everyone,\r\n\r\nI would like to know which version of broadway was used to make
  this sign. We currently have the URW-version.\r\nBut the descender of the y doesn't
  descend beyond the baseline and the lowercase t is different as well.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    [[http://myfonts.us/td-mvoO1R|Typeshop version]] seems to have the longest /y
    tail. The answer might also be that original Broadway has been altered to better
    fit signage requirements. Broadway version by Casady & Greene [[http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/r_z.htm|Ritz]]
    might be another option.
