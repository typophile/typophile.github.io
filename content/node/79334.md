  body: Close enough... thanks. Maybe it's an old version of it or something?

  body: They changed the dot on the "i" and modified the "k" as well. It's most likely
    these were modifications, not a different font that otherwise looks like Kabel
    Black.

  body: It's the original version of <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-tvEUsf">Kabel Black</a>,
    not the ITC version. Looks like they used an apostrophe from another font or something,
    though.

title: Old milk campaign. Any ideas what the font might be?
