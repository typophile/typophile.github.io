  body: "My hunch is that this was drawn using Illustrator Brushes. Without duplicate
    letters it's hard to prove that this is a font. I searched rough brush fonts and
    couldn't match this.\r\n\r\nDo you have any other samples of this lettering?\r\n\r\n-

  body: "It could be that once a letter was drawn it was duplicated as necessary,
    so that would mimic a font. It's also possible that this is an 'amateur' font,
    but I haven't checked some of those sites like Dafont and AbstractFonts. Maybe
    when I have time...\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
