  body: "You're welcome - actually, they all have the alternate swash-M. Dekros has
    it in a keyboar-accessible position, the left brace. The Monotype font has it
    in the 'mu' position and Rick Mueller's Greetings has it in the currency position.\r\n\r\nAnd
    just found one more - Grasshopper, by Nick Curtis."
