  is \"Estella\" is an italian word which means \"Star\"\r\nThe restaurant is all
  about mediterranean food and the owner told me that all the interior design will
  be very simple, using the typical elements of mediterranean look, like mosaics,
  wood floor, steel furniture, etc.\r\n\r\nHe is inspired on a port city of Italy
  called \"Portofino\" (beautiful by the way), so there you will find beautiful bay,
  yacht, sea, etc\r\n(im just trying to get you in the context) :)\r\n\r\nIve been
  looking for pictures of this style and i already have a color palette, but im desperately
  searching for the right font type, i still dont know if i have to work with a handscript
  or sans serif or maybe a mix of them, or probably im totally wrong. \r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions? Pleaseee!!\r\n"
