body: "I work for a fashion and lifestyle magazine, we are currently using Linotype
  Didot as the main headline/display font. We are looking at revamping the magazine
  in the next few months and I would really like to change the font to something that
  still has the essence of Didot (clean, elegant) but is fresher, more modern, funkier
  ... more 'now'! and hopefully with a larger family of weights to work with.\r\n\r\nWould
  appreciate your sage advice ...!\r\n"

    Could maybe be seen as Didot's distant kissing cousin. (Ok. Maybe that's a stretch.
    It is a cute typeface and I'd kiss it too.)\r\n- <a href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100031\">Chronicle</a>.
    Scotch is all the rage. Great range of weights and widths too.\r\n\r\nAnother
    thought. Don't go drastic, just go better. <a href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100004\">HTF
    Didot</a>. A few other fashion magazine are trying to use them right now. But
    failing miserably. It deserves to be used in a grand way. "

    it doesn't have a huge number of weights.

    for headlines and archer screams du mode.

    has some affinity with Moderns. I don't know if it will strike you as a suitable
    alternative. It's found a happy place in some bridal magazines.\r\n\r\nThere is
    a PDF sample of the Display fonts at http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanDisplay_Sample.pdf\r\n\r\nThe
    Display fonts aren't available via Font Bureau's Retail library yet, but you can
    contact them directly if you want to explore these for your publication. Also,
    I recently created Titling versions with even more contrast for <cite>Fortune</cite>
    magazine, which might be of value to fashion/lifestyle. The more the contrast,
    the more Bodoni-esque the design becomes. You can talk to FB about these as well.\r\n\r\n&lt;/Self

  body: "Fuschia,\r\nI went through this exercise a few years ago when I redesigned
    a fashion magazine. The didones have been inextricably linked to fashion for decades
    and it's hard to get away from them unless you're trying to do something edgy
    or undergound. I ended up going with Didot Elder for display as it really stands
    out from the competition and is beautifully drawn (esp. the 's' with ball terminals),
    but it has a polarizing effect on people and receives raves and criticism in equal
    measure."

    be too rounded for you. It would help if you mentioned specifically what kind
    of fashion you are talking about...from the didot reference, i'm assuming it's
    geared to sophisticated early 30's to late 40's urban female?\r\n\r\nthat's my

    in Paris Vogue and Baskerville is another one showing up in high end fashion magazines

    idea there were so many didots around. But alternatively, I would love to be able
    to get away from them a bit as it's true they have been associated with fashion
    for a long time. Our magazine (Scoop ... www.scoop.com.au) is only partly fashion,
    there's a lot of lifestyle stuff in there, food, wine, entertainment etc. I will
    let you know what is finally chosen!"
