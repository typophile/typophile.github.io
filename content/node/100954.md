body: "Does the world really need one more vernacular pop culture typeface? We here,
  at astroluxtype shout a resounding yes!\r\n\r\nSure,  you can find the apex of fine
  font design that will have your mind and eyes burst with joy at the level of sophistication
  and craftsmanship they exhibit- Koo Koo Puff Condensed and Light Condensed are not
  one of those fonts. But if kooky goofy is your thing, we're selling it at the astroluxtype
  booth.\r\n\r\nKoo Koo Puff Light Condensed is the companion font to Koo Koo Puff
  Regular Condensed. Both fonts includes an upper and lowercase glyph set. It has
  a different upper and lowercase \u201CO\u201D from the original Koo Koo Puff Regular
  Condensed. Spacing metrics are looser, as well. The font is not a match for Regular
  Condensed, it is a separate font. Both are headline display faces, for optimum usage
  it is recommended, not be set smaller than 48 points in size.\r\n\r\nLook to astroluxtype\u2019s
  Sugarbang! as the first in a series of fonts inspired by vintage product packaging,
  Koo Koo Puff is the second release in the Cerealboxx series. The third font is in
  the fridge getting cool now, watch for it in the future.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/koopuffLITE_6590.post1.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/koopuffpost1_3564.jpg]"
