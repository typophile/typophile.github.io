body: "Welcome to our third newsletter! :)\r\n\r\nCheapProFonts is still growing.
  This quarter Derek Vogelpohl (of ShyFonts/Shyfoundry) joined the roster, as well
  - so now there will be some good text-fonts available in our usual large multilingual
  character set, too. We hope you will enjoy them!\r\n\r\nIn this news release I present
  12 fonts:\r\n- 4 from Derek Vogelpohl\r\n- 2 from Ray Larabie\r\n- 2 from Kevin
  King\r\n- 2 from Brian Kent\r\n- 1 from Nick Curtis\r\n- 1 from myself - and it's
  free! :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CheapProFonts-NEWS-08-Q3.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  have also made a PDF Font Catalog available for download - here you can really zoom
  in on the details of all our fonts. I am rather proud of the (often) cleaned-up
  outlines, and the way I have designed and implemented some of the more demanding
  diacritics :)\r\n\r\nCheapProFonts is dedicated to supplying high-quality OpenType
  and TrueType fonts for setting \u201Cforeign\u201D languages (languages requiring
  more than the basic A-Z characters) for professional Mac and Windows users.\r\n\r\nCheck
  our site for constant new releases, and see you in the next newsletter!\r\n\r\nRoger
  S. Nelsson\r\n\u2014\r\nhttp://www.CheapProFonts.com\r\nHigh quality multilingual
  fonts at a low price - for professional (non-english) designers with a small budget!\r\n"
