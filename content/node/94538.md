  concept of the project is a boutique hotel with a space-cowboy theme. \r\nWild West
  meets intergalactic. I want to come up with a typeface for the logo.\r\nThe thing
  that seemed logical for me to do is design a futuristic looking slab serif. The
  slab serifs that are usually\r\nassociated with wood-type letter-pressing.\r\nSo
  let me show you what I've got so far and let me know what you think or any suggestions.
  Thank you very much once \r\nagain typophiles.\r\nOh yeah, the name of the hotel
  is 'Galileo'.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/options_3540.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5141.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_5717.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_4415.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_5031.JPG]"

  body: "I REALLY like the overall effect. I think it evokes exactly what you're trying
    for. \r\nIf you hadn't said that the word was GALILEO, I'd of thought it was CALILEO.
    It just doesn't look Geeish.\r\n\r\nThe thin-lines version isn't suitable for
    white-on-black use. The thin lines almost disappear in the large size, and everything
    disappears in the sub-text.\r\n\r\nThe sketches with the Tuscan effect completely
    lose the space-modern feeling - glad you decided against them!\r\n\r\n    - Herb"

  body: "Thank you for the comment Herb.\r\nI did not decide against the sketches,
    I just did not digitalize them.\r\nI made the tuscan versions to make it seem
    more obvious that its wild west.\r\nI think at this point, I'll go ahead and work
    further on the more space looking one\r\nthat you prefer. \r\n"

  body: "I would agree with Herb about the G looking a like a C, but I don't think
    you should rule out the Tuscan effect just quite yet - I feel like it would've
    been the cowboy half of the typeface. Right now, for me, it feels like the digital
    version is about 98% space themed. Maybe if the slabs were dramatically heavier
    than the stems it'd feel more letterpress/western poster?\r\n\r\nI think as long
    as you carry on the asymmetric weight / deconstruction of forms, mixed with high
    contrast geometric shapes, you'll still have a spacey typeface that looks like
    it's from the west. If you added the Tuscan effect that is.\r\n\r\nI like the
    idea though for sure, and I think it will really come together when paired with
    that space cowboy imagery."
