body: "One Typophile, on seeing a preview of Greater Albion's Cherritt described it
  as a \u201CVictorian Courier\u201D equivalent.  We rather like that idea, courier
  being an eminently practical family of faces, but Cherritt can do so much more.
  \ We've just posted a .pdf sampler with specimens of all twenty faces in the soon
  to be released Cherritt family on our [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | blog]].\r\n\r\n"
