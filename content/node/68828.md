  body: Closest I can think of is Typodermic's "Mikadan". It doesn't seem to be an
    exact match but it's pretty darn close. How old is this sample? Mikadan is apparently
    based on a typeface called "Verona" from 1948, but I can't find any digital versions
    of that.

  body: Ah yes, from what I'm reading "Verona" was simply the ATF version of Bologna.
    Are there any exact digital reproductions of Bologna/Verona or is Mikadan as close
    as we can get?

  body: "Tamas is right, and Verona was ATF's adaptation of it. It is shown in Mac
    McGrew's book on American Metal Typefaces, and it is identical to the type in
    this sample. Interestingly, he says Bologna was itself a slightly modified version
    of an older ATF typeface called Humanistic, from 1904, which is also shown in
    the book.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mikadan is the only Bologna/Verona digitizaton I know.\r\n\r\n-
