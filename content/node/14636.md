body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Typefaces]] : FF Legato</strong>\r\n\r\nThe following
  text about FF Legato was written by its creator, [[Evert Bloemsma]] in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/ff%20-%20legato_about.pdf\">this
  <cite>About FF Legato</cite> PDF file</a>.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/legato110906pdh01_5788.gif]\r\nMost
  [[sans serif|sanserifs]] have very basic geometric shapes (like [[Futura]]), even
  those built using classical proportions (like [[Gill Sans]]). But this is not the
  most satisfactory approach when trying to visually connect separate characters,
  which in turn usually leads to most long texts being set in serifed typefaces.\r\n\r\nFF
  Legato abandons the idea of a sanserif consisting of simple rigid forms. The mirrored
  image below shows how (different from typefaces like Gill Sans and [[Syntax]]) movement
  and direction is expressed by outer- and inner-forms behaving relatively independent,
  and is maintained through all [[weight|weights]]. It makes characters refer to previous
  and next letters to build better words and lines.\r\n\r\nMany sanserifs published
  these days combine a \u2018pleasant\u2019 appearance with a conventional construction.
  This is just what I wanted to avoid designing FF Legato. In discussions FF Legato
  has been compared with typefaces like [[Finnegan]] ([[Linotype]]) and [[Cronos]]
  ([[Adobe]]). [[Contrast]] of such faces is strong and along a single vertical [[axis]];
  vertical bars are emphasized. This becomes clear when looking at a character like
  the lowercase \u2018o\u2019 at bolder weights. The construction establishes a strong
  rhythm but does not necessarily improve word images.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary; it
  optically splits up words into single letters with stems as independant elements,
  just as our alphabet already splits up terms in separate units on a \u2018system-level\u2019.
  Often the resulting austerity is then masked, for example by decorative details
  suggesting the touch of a brush or nib. Such typefaces will work fine for packaging
  etc. but their use for larger texts is questionable and they may not fit contemporary,
  transparent graphic design.\r\n\r\nIn [[1993]] my rather experimental [[FF Balance]]
  was published. It completely reverses the conventional contrast (\u2018incorrect
  contrast\u2019); horizontal parts are thicker than vertical parts. The illustration
  below compares the sanserifs [[Univers]] (emphasizing vertical parts), FF Balance
  (emphasizing horizontal parts) and FF Legato (emphasizing diagonals from the upper
  left to the lower right). Each one of them builds a different rhythm, creates a
  different interaction between the characters; a different continuity.\r\n\r\nFF
  Legato was recognized as one of its <a href=\"http://typographi.com/000969.php\">Favorite
