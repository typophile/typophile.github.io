body: "Hi guys! I really would appreciate if any of you have seen a font that looks
  like the one in the picture. I suspect that this is a Art Deco type, since this
  is used in a old french  fashion magazine from the early 1900's. Any help would
  be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://cdn.lts.cr/files/355bba46d941c912af92/5320411079_e239d671e8_a_small.jpg\"

  body: That's earlier in style than either Art Deco or Art Nouveau, maybe "Neo-rococo"
    or something like that would be the most appropriate designation. (Haven't found
    a good match either, yet.)
