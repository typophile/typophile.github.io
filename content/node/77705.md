  contrast stroke thickness, for magazine titling. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nI have
  been looking at interview magazine as a ref BUT I think this is a bespoke cut for
  interview?\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks."

    too idiosyncratic in its detailing for him, compared to the typical \"clean\"
    finish of display moderns, of which there are many, e.g. Montalbano's \"Yo\" family.
