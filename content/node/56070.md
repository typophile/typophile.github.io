  for my non-marketing colleagues in the organisation. It will include points about
  plain English, capitalisation, font choice (to avoid red Arial bold italic), the
  difference between a hyphen and a dash and other relevant bits and pieces.\r\n\r\nI
  want to include a short point on use of white space in documents (reports, instructions,
  presentations) and web pages. I was thinking something along the lines of: White
  space should be used deliberately in designing all corporate communications. \r\n\r\nMy
  problem is that I can't formulate the reason for this very well and want to say
  more than 'because it looks nice and uncluttered'. \r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest why
  white space should be designed into documents rather than left over at the end,
  or point me in the direction of other style guides/web sites?\r\n\r\nThanks:)"

    will understand or even pay attention to what you add about white space unless
    you are adding a specific rule for each document. For example \"Each document
    must have a 3 inch left margin.\" \r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?"

    too many documents with tiny crunched up text with no gutters, margins or breathing
    space and with pictures so small you need a magnifying glass. Thanks, good to
    think all around this before writing.

    presents a list representing the hierarchy of white space in typography:\r\n1.
    the white shapes in words\r\n2. the shapes between words\r\n3. the space between
    lines\r\n4. the space between columns\r\n5. the background of text\r\nHe says
    it's order is a condition of legibility.\r\n\r\nI might add that in the macrotypography
    domain effective use of white space is a condition of robust navigability, and
    distinctive use of what space a condition of brand specificity and cohesion."

  body: "Nick, don't you find that newspaper layout really offputting? In terms of
    readability it may be ok but it doesn't work for me from a designer's point of
    view. I'm thinking navigability (not knowing where to start reading) and the amount
    of information are difficult.\r\n\r\nI found this on Wikipedia <cite>'Judicious
    use of white space can give a page a classic, elegant, or rich appearance. For
    example, upscale brands often use ad layouts with little text and a lot of white
    space. Inexpert use of white space can make a page appear incomplete.'</cite>\r\n\r\nAnd
    this from another website <cite>'white space is used for purely semiotic values;
    for values of presentation which transcend economic values by insisting that the
    image of what you present is more important than the paper you could be saving.'</cite>\r\n\r\nSo
    the 'luxury' aspect is more suitable for selling expensive products than it would
    be for setting a purely informational newspaper, perhaps. \r\n\r\nHowever, I'm
    suddenly worried about the last sentence of the Wikipedia piece, so perhaps it
    is better after all to specify margins than expect non-designers to use white
    space cleverly."

    the silly buggers move their thumbs.\r\n\r\nKeeping the number of pages down can
    be evaluated. The cost of paper, the cost of makeready (if printed), and in human
    costs, especially the ergs expended in turning pages.\r\n\r\nThis can present
    a real challenge with, say, a title page. Their just isn't enough copy to fill
    the page. Perhaps write a little more? Or maybe add some ornaments, the print
    equivalent of tarting up with earrings, rouge, etc.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nIf you
    are preparing a print piece, you can a least illustrate the point on white space
    by including a sample of asymmetric typography contrasted to centered typography.\r\n\r\nThe
    use of white space is a comfort matter, just like every other element of typography.
    Seeing and appreciating it is a matter of learning; once learned, it becomes part
    of an audience's expectations & reactions."

  body: "\"Include some space to let the text breathe\" is a useful tip.\r\nIt can
    be as simple as just making sure that headlines aren't sized up to fill the available
    space.\r\n\r\nBut \"White Space\", as an element of asymmetric modernist page
    layouts is problematic.\r\nI don't think it's something that most people can do
    without a fair amount of study and practice, developing an understanding and eye
    for it. \r\n\r\nConsider modernist architecture. A large office block by Mies,
    with its expanses of plain and pure form, expensive materials, discrete detailing
    and subtle proportions, is beautiful. But in lesser hands with less budget, modernism
    became a crude and brutal exercise of corporate/government power.\r\n\r\nWhite
    Space is ideologically fraught.\r\nIts origins, connected to the clean and healthy
    aspirations of modernist design with social purpose.\r\nAnd now the environmental
    issue.\r\n\r\nIgnoring screen display, consider that White Space is an inherent
    waste of resources.\r\nIn corporate or institutional publications, designers are
    taught to waste paper to create the \"minimalist\" aesthetic. A large part of
    the effect relies on identifying the awe of big size with the power of the publisher/advertiser
    who can afford to waste paper--that is the aesthetic. We have established a norm
    where small publications and advertisements just don't look right for large organizations.
    So big corporations and government are inherently wasteful.\r\n\r\nWhere does
    the creative industry get off, with its conscience intact, talking about being
    green, when the creative that it honors most is the work which wastes most paper
    with big pictures and lots of white space? If you're so creative, get the message
    across efficiently, sell the product with a smaller ad.\r\n\r\nAnd if small is
    beautiful, then perhaps spend longer conceptualizing and writing to shrink and
    concentrate the message, because labor is ultimately greener than materials, minimize
    the physical footprint, and use rules and borders to separate matter, because
    that takes up less real estate than White Space. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    white space. Luckily most of our documents are viewed electronically but are still
    sometimes printed, so that's not so great if there's a lot of unproductive space.
    \r\n\r\nI guess I'm partly annoyed to see my nice layouts meddled with, so we
    end up with a welcome note squashed on the bottom of the contents page. Maybe
    I should just accept that I'm going to have to copy edit and layout everything
    important that goes out. Hopefully a few simple guidelines can make that job less
    time consuming."

    whitespace feel like they're more special, since time has been spent to consider
    the reading experience and the professional appearance. Nobody wants to approach
    a document that doesn't look neat. (Sorry, I have to work with a lot of very horrible
