  body: "I don't have the Pro, but as I remembered, the original Scala Sans (Type
    1) files weren't really properly encoded -- some extended characters were in the
    \"wrong\" places. It also came with separate Small caps (or All Caps, possibly)
    and \"Expert\" files. It's quite likely these are now integrated into one complete
    Opentype feature-filled font file.\r\n\r\n(A quick look at the glyphs map on <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-scala-sans/pro-regular/characters.html\">MyFonts:Scala
    Sans Pro</a> shows way, way, <em>way</em> more characters than I remember, and
    indeed also come with an integrated Small Caps set inside the Regular style. If
    you scroll down the complete style list of all Scala Sanses, you can see the glyph
    list for the original <em>en plein form</em>.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the difference
    is between 'original' Scala Sans and the \"OT\" form -- it may have been an intermediate
    phase, before it was vastly enhanced.)"
