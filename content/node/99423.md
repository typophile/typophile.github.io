  to modify the outlines of certain glyphs in Charis SIL. FontForge is the font editor
  I'm currently trying because it's free.\r\n\r\nMy problem is, after modifying the
  font in FontForge and saving, the resulting font no longer has Graphite features
  such as stacking combining diacritics. Apparently the Graphite tables in the font
  are lost in the new font.\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me the proper way to modify and
  save Charis SIL with FontForge (or any other free font editor)?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nZiyuan
  Yao\r\n"

  body: "Here is a suggestion that may work, if you want to keep all tables intact:
    \ try <code>ttx</code>. It comes with <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html\">AFDKO</a>,
    the Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType (which provides other tools to manipulate
    font tables).\r\n\r\nOnce <code>ttx</code> is installed, I suggest you decompile
    only the glyf and the name table with the line command:\r\n<pre>\r\n   ttx -t
    name -t glyf CharisSIL-R.ttf\r\n</pre>\r\nThis creates the file <code>CharisSIL-R.ttx</code>
    (if you repeat, a version number is added to the name).\r\n\r\nIf you already
    designed your modified glyph, you apply <code>ttx -t glyf</code> on that font;
    for example, if the glyph you modified is ccedilla, then replace the text in <code>CharisSIL-R.ttx</code>
    between\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;TTGlyph name=\"ccedilla\" xMin=\"66\" yMin=\"-457\" xMax=\"825\"
    yMax=\"1012\"&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\nand the closing\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;/TTGlyph&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\nwith
    the new description of ccedilla figuring in the ttx file of your new set of glyphs.
    You also change the font names according to your needs (and the EULA) in the name
    table.\r\n\r\nYou finally apply\r\n<pre>\r\n   ttx -m CharisSIL-R.ttf CharisSIL-R.ttx\r\n</pre>\r\nto
    obtain your new font file <code>CharisSIL-R#1.ttf</code> which is likely to work
    better than the font you generated with fontforge.\r\n\r\nI used a variation of
    that method with AAT fonts and it saved me many calls to the standard tool to
    generate AAT fonts. If it works fine for you with Graphite tables, please keep
    us informed.\r\n\r\nHere, I presume you keep the character width intact as well
    as its position in the bounding box (else you will need to work harder).\r\n"

    body: "Hi Michel,\r\n\r\nNow I figured out how to change a glyph's width too:
      the glyph's \"mtx\" attribute in the \"hmtx\" table has to be changed accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe
      project in question is \"Phonetically Intuitive English\" (https://sites.google.com/site/phoneticallyintuitiveenglish/).
      I will mention you in its Acknowledgments :-)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nZiyuan Yao\r\n"

    RIGHT HALF RING ABOVE) and\r\n        uni030D (COMBINING VERTICAL LINE ABOVE),\r\nso
    that they can be viewed more easily at small font sizes.\r\n\r\nNow it seems this
    also involves changing these glyphs' bounding boxes. What else should I do to
    achieve this?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nZiyuan Yao\r\n"

  body: "Great! Here is something faster (and that worked for me). Instead of text
    editing (or xml parsing) the file CharisSIL-R.ttx generated from CharisSIL-R.ttf,
    you can merge full tables of the new font generated by FontForge into CharisSIL-R.ttf
    ; choose \"Reencode > Glyph Order\" in FontForge before generating the new font
    and then execute <code>ttx -m CharisSIL-R.ttf newfont.ttx</code> with <code>newfont.ttx</code>
    containing just the replacement tables from the new font (the ttf that is generated
    is named newfont... ).\r\n\r\nMichel Boyer"

  body: I just checked with Charis in the present context, with ttx and fontforge,
    and the reordering does not seem necessary.  The other tools I was using required
    it. That is something I experimented about 18 months ago (during my summer vacations)
    and that was  left undocumented.
