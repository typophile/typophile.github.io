  I use my Delta Sky Miles to go to Dallas, the cheap bastards are going to MAKE ME
  go through Cleveland or Detroit to get there. Which seems kinda screwy to me, but
  works for them. I, unfortunately, still smoke\u2014figuratively and, alas, literally\u2014so\u2026\r\n\r\nOn
  the one hand, Cleveland is better because they actually let you smoke in a designated
  \u201Cplease kill yourself here\u201D zone; whereas, in Detroit, they DO NOT let
  you kill yourself inside the airport: you MUST go outside to do that, and then comes
  back through security with a boarding pass, ALL before your flight leaves in a couple
  hours or so. Which sucks. But, actually, might not, if\u2026\r\n\r\nHow abou\u2026the
  \u201Cnext connecting flight out\u201D is not two hours off, but twenty-six hours
  off? Same time, same flight number probably, only a different date. What\u2019s
  wrong with that? From where I am sitting, absolutely nothing. For Delta Airlines,
  on the other hand, it may just be one of those \u201Cunintended consequences\u201D
  they will have a VERY TIME explaining away. Like me. Go figure.\r\n\r\nHey: you
  screw with me, I screw with you. Your game: your rules. Gotcha. But good. Plus,
  I spilled the beans in an internet forum. While it would be VERY nice for Delta
  to pay me a big wad of dough to STFU, that option will soon be off the table.\r\n\r\nOr,
  maybe, I just don't tell them that the beans are thermodynamically, irreversibly
  spilt. Where? Typophile? Who the HELL are they? Nobody, really\u2026well, THAT's
  not true but, if I'm bluffing, they do not NEED to know that. Okay? On the QT. On
  the down-low. Capisce?\r\n\r\nOne way or another, I gotta toast the old man with
  a Schlitz. It's the good sh*t\u2026which, sadly, some people might find a contradiction
  in terms, but absolutely true.\r\n\r\nWho the hell is buying, because I got a lot
  more material\u2026"

    said I myself am a big fan of super-long layovers, especially when it means getting
    in some extra tourism sans hotel costs. On the way back from ATypI-Leipzig in
    2000 I managed to splice in a 16-hour layover in Amsterdam, which I had visited
    before* but relished seeing again. The problem is I hadn't planned for the eyeball-sized
    blisters under both my feet from haunting Leipzig on foot for 3 days after the
    conference... So I was really happy to finally board that flight home, especially
    since I hadn't slept for over 40 hours.\r\n\r\n* And would most notably visit
    with my wife on our first child's first birthday, which, unbeknown to us just
    happened to be on Queen's Day... Indelible memories.\r\n\r\nMore recently I used
    a five-day layover via London to splice in trips to Istanbul and then Reading
    University on the way back. Never actually made it into London.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>you
    screw with me, I screw with you.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn 1992 (so before the Internet
    tamed the airlines) when I had become tired of LA and decided to split for Barcelona
    some airlines actually charged more for one-way flights than round-trip*, which
    naturally made me quite enraged when booking through Northwest, so on the randomly-chosen
    \"return\" flight I made it a point to not only reconfirm but also to call their
    airport location an hour before the flight and tell them to please wait for me
    as I was running late, but was sure to show up right before they closed the gate...\r\n\r\n*
    I have a theory as to why, but will wait to see if others can make more sense
    of that -thankfully past- corporate skulduggery.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    my money, and you delivered. Props, dude: I have to admit\u2014before God, Nick
    Shinn (a close second) and the whole Typophile community\u2014that you may well
    be\u2014possibly\u2014ALMOST as screwy as me. Almost. OTOH, I will also have to
    admit that when it comes to the \u201Cscrewing with morons\u201D part of screwy:
    you are the champ. Hands down. I, quite frankly, would not have the balls to pull
    off the stunt you pulled. You screw your way, I screw mine\u2026and never the
    twain shall meet. But, it would be nice if someone could pick me up at the airport.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    ladies and gents, if it is REALLY worth your while to see JUST HOW LARGE Hrant's
    balls are\u2014and AREN'T WE ALL?\u2014pony up and pay his airfare to Milwaukee,
    would ya? Jeez! The guy is a LAFF RIOT!\r\n\r\nAnd, Lozos: bring the freaking

    has GOT TO BE THERE to \u201Cpunctuate\u201D the money lines! Capisce? Or whatever
    the hell Lozos said the Greek equivalent is. I forget: it\u2019s ALL GREEK to
    me!\r\n\r\nOkay, Hrant, old buddy, old pal: I have done my level best to get you
    there\u2014tax, title and license paid. NOW\u2026\r\n\r\nI need to get on the
    horn and try to screw with Delta Airlines\u2019 mind (perhaps a contradiction
    in terms, but what the hell? Does ANYTHING make ANY SENSE ANYMORE?\r\n\r\nAnyhoo\u2026SOMEONE
    is GOING to BUY ME a Schlitz! And, hey: if I have played my cards right, it will
    be Hrant. Because\u2014IF I have played my cards right\u2014HE is going to OWE
    ME\u2026BIG TIME! To the tune of\u2026\r\n\r\n(Lozos! Drumroll!)\r\n\r\nOne cheap
    beer! Sweeeeeet!\r\n\r\nNow, THAT is a con my old man would appreciate, cheap
    bastard that he was. God rest his soul: he died twenty years ago, August 3rd.
    Close enough to TypeCon, one the money for the family get together I got to get
    to. As cheap as possible, because I HONOR MY FATHER.\r\n\r\nCome on, people: WORK
    with me here!"
