  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Well, I&rsquo;m in a crappy mood this morning, I came in and was told that I needed to make some visual changes to a website I designed the end of last year. It&rsquo;s been well over 6 months since I&rsquo;ve looked at this site.</p>
<p>So, I went to the folder where I have everything and I mean everything. If this were a physical place, I could imagine boxes piled high and in every box there&rsquo;s tiny pieces (and lots of duplicates with minor imperfections.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that when it comes to saving files I get into a very simplistic mode (I&rsquo;m just surprised I save often enough to not have to worry about NOT having a file.), but this mess clearly proves I need to go the extra step.</p>
<p>I was wondering how you guys tackle the organizational problems of design in our computer world. Do you sort everything into specific folders, give them version names, dates, letters and numbers? OR do you delete all the development at the end and save only the major components.</p>
<p>I could use any helpful insight.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in the same vein, looking at the date of creation&hellip; which isn&rsquo;t always the best method because I might actually go back and use a previous version as the final.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;older files&rdquo; is also a good idea that I&rsquo;ve done, but labeled mine &ldquo;Development&rdquo; In any regards, it&rsquo;s still not the best solution.</p>

I have a large hard drive on my iMac but also back up files (the main files) on an external hard drive, and when the job is complete I burn a CD or DVD for additional backup. I&rsquo;ve had hard drives (both internal and external) crash on me so I&rsquo;m very careful to have all the main job files in more than one place. By main job files I mean the Quark or InDesign files, not necessarily all the jpegs or tiffs. I usually date the folders but not each file, altho I&rsquo;ll tack on a version number at the end to keep track. (I should add that I design books so each job usually has multiple files, one for each chapter).</p>
<p>My office/apartment is a mess but my computer is very tidy. Next to nothing on my &ldquo;desktop&rdquo; and files all where they should be and clearly organized. I usually have separate folders for text, images, layouts, pdfs.</p>
<p>It may take a bit of extra time to be vigilant while you&rsquo;re working but it&rsquo;s worth it. One friend suggested you schedule your backups, say tuesday mornings or something so that you&rsquo;re never more than a week behind.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I have a pretty serious method of organizing all my stuff. Theres a file in my home directory where all my art/design work goes. There are categories in there, work, school, etc., and subcategories for clients, semesters, etc. Each project then gets its own folder, all the layout files go in there. Subfolders exist for anything getting linked into the project or used as source files for creating something that does. The actual document layouts get saved as project.day.month.year.version and  every so often I dump all the old versions into a subfolder that usually gets deleted after the project is done.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Auch, this is an area I could do with some self-discipline (alongside with the neatness of my desk, but that&rsquo;s another story).</p>
<p>With more complicated projects (or long lasting) I have a folder named something like &ldquo;to the client&rdquo;, which contains all the pdfs sent. It&rsquo;s then easy to spot the final accepted version, unless they decided on some previous version, of course. There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;versions&rdquo; or &ldquo;old files&rdquo; folder, too. Also, I usually have a copy of the folder I sent to the printshop.
By the time a project is finished with, another one is often on the go, and I don&rsquo;t seem to have time to clear out the excess files from the finished project, and end up with a similar situation you just described.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting. It appears we&rsquo;re all over the map when it comes to organizing our files.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to hear from some of the more Web-centric designers. 
Seeing as the project I have to change is a webpage. It&rsquo;s a mess really. There aren&rsquo;t just multiple versions of the original design, but also subsequently multiple versions of how I sliced the images up and set the image maps (we&rsquo;re old school here, I design, do all the slicing in Image Ready and then send to a developer to fix the code and upload.)</p>
<p>This is the kind of stuff they either drill into you at school/work or you have to hobble through life trying to figure it out piecemeal, changing and adapting as your design language/skills change.</p>
<p>I wish it was simple, and the files all have a file name that I can look at and instantly know if one was older or the last version used.</p>

<p>And not to sound schoolmarmy, but now that you&rsquo;ve run into this problem it should at least help you going forward to know what you&rsquo;ll need and organize/name the files appropriately. A lot of my filing and naming systems come from having lost files due to hard drive crashes and accidental deletions. I realize this doesn&rsquo;t help you with the problem at hand tho.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I usually also have a folder with a lot of redundant and obsolete versions of files. After I know where I&rsquo;m going, I usually make a folder inside the folder and name it something like &lsquo;old&rsquo;, and put everything in there, exept the latest version of the file(s) that I am actually using. Especially handy when visiting the folder later, like you are doing now. Sometimes I add something like &lsquo;finish&rsquo; or &lsquo;printversion&rsquo; to the name of the file that&rsquo;s being used. This is how I do it for freelance work and my own work.
At the company I was working for a year ago, we really had a system for storing the data, because everything was backed up, and put into the archive. Those filenames had date, order number (especially), year, name of client, etc. That way we could search the number or name in the archive-computer, and know on which CD/HDD/Server the files were stored for later use/reprint.</p>
<p>With work like InDesign, I sometimes make folders inside a &lsquo;master&rsquo; folder, with names like &lsquo;images&rsquo;, &lsquo;resources&rsquo; (original text-files etc.) and have the InDesign-file itself in the master folder. Basically what InDesign does when it makes a Package. This is also the way we needed to do it at the company I mentioned before.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The simplest is to tack on a suffix like .1, .2, etc. Sometimes it becomes .2a and such. I don&rsquo;t add dates because it makes the file names too long. But I&rsquo;ll date the folders - when I have my s**t together. That&rsquo;s helpful also for reference with the client - you can be sure you&rsquo;re talking about the same version.</p>
<p>Because I do books, I usually set it up as follows:
Folder: book title + date (or sometimes Layouts1, Layouts2)
Files:
a.frontmatter_pp1-15
b.chapter1_pp16-35
etc.</p>
<p>Then .1, .2 as the revisions happen. Often I&rsquo;ll put a cap F at the end of the final version (the one that went to the printer). But then, of course, there are more changes so it becomes F1, F2 etc.</p>
<p>The trick too is to remember to do a &ldquo;save as&rdquo; before you start reworking the file so that you have preserved your earlier version intact. And back it up elsewhere in case you mess up.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I organize my stuff into a main folder with the project&rsquo;s name and the main file, and subfolders called texts, images, illustrations, recherche, etc.</p>
<p>While working on the project I generally use the option &ldquo;open recent files&rdquo; to get to the latest version of my document and sometimes I take an extra look onto the date (especially when working with the book palette).</p>
<p>Then, first thing I do, at least at a new day, is saving the file under a new number (filename_1, filename_2, etc.). Additionally I have a second version  of the file (filename_1bak, filename_2bak). This has really saved me sometimes, it doesn&rsquo;t happen very often, but if, I was always very grateful about this second chance. With these two versions I can save the file now and then by &ldquo;save as&rdquo; (filename_1 &ldquo;save as&rdquo; filename_1bak and vice versa the next time). At the end of the day I&rsquo;ve got two identical versions  (file_2 and file_2bak) so it wouldn&rsquo;t be that bad if I&rsquo;d mess up one of them the next day ;-) The good thing about doing a &ldquo;save as&rdquo; in InDesign is that this minimizes the file size as well. Now and then I drop the older files into a folder called &ldquo;older versions&rdquo;. And in the evening I (try not to forget to) transfer the latest versions to an external hard drive.</p>
<p>A PDF I like for quick overviews while working.</p>
<p>((With these routines I until now hesitate to use the book palette in InDesign. Here you should only open your document from within the palette and I find this quite confusing, mainly I think because I&rsquo;m not used to it (I might open an (older) document via &ldquo;open recent&rdquo; in between because I&rsquo;m so used to this and end up with 3 versions, trying to re-follow what I&rsquo;d changed in two different documents in the end, which is embarrassing). Although the book palette is useful in the end of a project to get the page numbers right &ndash; and I&rsquo;m still curious if there is a way to work happily with the book palette all the time?))</p>
<p>When the project is done, I save the last version, with all the complete packaged stuff I&rsquo;d sent to the printer, meanwhile at two cds/dvds because sometimes I&rsquo;d found one of them had been damaged with time and I wasn&rsquo;t able to open it again.</p>

<p>My method has evolved like this: I open a folder for whatever it is (InfoBooklet 07-08). Inside, I start the layout and save each version, marking the version with _1 _2 _3 as applicable. Then, the version chosen to be the working layout gets the number removed, and the numbered versions go into a folder of their own within the main folder. As I add stuff to the document I&rsquo;ll create, all within the main folder, folders for logos, pictures, translation, and so on. I also create an email folder for the project because most updates come to me by email. So even if I&rsquo;ve managed to delete or screw up something along the way, I&rsquo;ll have the original update in the email.</p>
<p>For finalized files, I put _final. I make a PDF of it, and package the files. Sometimes I need to have a different final version for web and for print, and I name them accordingly.</p>
<p>But I also don&rsquo;t work for multiple clients. And my publications are only updated once a year, so it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Of course, I also heard of someone who everyday created a folder with that date and put whatever they did that day into the folder. I know I would never maintain that, and figure it wouldn&rsquo;t be a practical way to track specific project components.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am not always willing to go the extra mile for organization so the model I use is to start the project with a name &lsquo;projectx&rsquo; or what ever &amp; then put a 0001 &amp; then the file extension. When a project takes a really new jig I will often just skip to 0100 &amp; keep going from there. And then 0200 for each new step after meeting with a client. Itterations within a thread sometimes take letters too so &lsquo;0123g&rsquo; is a name I can build up to. So far I have never needed to get past 2000.</p>
<p>The reason I like this method is that it is good for &lsquo;threaded&rsquo; projects where you diverge into a few ideas &amp; cut off some options &amp; then spin some new ones out from a base design. Really linear projects would probably not be hurt by it either though. I suppose if you really wanted to keep a thread&rsquo;s integrity you could always use a001, b001 &amp; so on. But I have not found that I benefited from keeping things that reified.</p>
<p>when color is an issue -usually in the second half of the project or near then end when final art is being made I will indicate that with a .rgb or a .bwrgb or .bwcmyk or .cmyk - so far I have not needed to archive lab color stuff.  Usually the file has a new more fully desriptive name at the end as well with a date so it might be</p>
<p>&lsquo;clientname.flyer.7.12.06.rgb.pdf&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have enjoyed reading what you guys do to keep on top of things. Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I work at an ad agency and I am pulling my hair out trying to work through my colleagues folder structure and naming conventions. I believe each project should follow the same protocol so anyone (freelancer, colleague, you 6 months later) can jump in and be familiar with the logic. This thread has been really insightful to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found the best approach for me, at the expense of disk space, is to version out in rounds. This is an example of a website:</p>
<p>top level  /  [copy][concepts][production]
concepts   /  [PSDs][JPGs][FLAs][PDFs][Assets]
PSDs       /  [round_01][round_02][round_03][round_XX]
round_01   /  01_homepage.psd, 02_aboutus.psd, 03_clients.psd
JPGs       /  01_homepage.jpg, 02_aboutus.jpg, 03_clients.jpg
PDFs       /  filename_date.pdf</p>
<p>Its probably over the top, but each time I get a new direction, or if there is a shift in design I duplicate the round. The old files are left intact*. I never change the file name because what does &ldquo;new&rdquo;,&ldquo;newer&rdquo;,&ldquo;this_is_really_the_final finalFINALFINAL&rdquo; really mean? Believe me, I did this for a long time, and my new approach has saved me hours of unnecessary work. The file name always stays the same from round_01 to round_XX.</p>
<p>This helps out tremendously when you are saving out for client/internal presentations. You don&rsquo;t have to create rounds in your JPGs folder. Its the same file name in every round. Then, if you have to create a PDF for the presentation, the 01_,02_,03_ prefix allows you easily order your presentation. Its already in the order you determined in your PSDs.</p>
<ul>
<li>this has saved me so many times. you can easily re-trace your steps and show the iterations to clients who can&rsquo;t easily see the evolution of your designs. Or if they want to go back to &ldquo;the design you had a couple of weeks ago.&rdquo;</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some really helpful suggestions from the mass. I really appreciate it all.</p>
<p>Thru this whole ordeal, I did come to one truth. That is, it&rsquo;s not so much how one organizes their files, it&rsquo;s the simple fact that it&rsquo;s so difficult to delete/remove a file.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an invisible umbilical cord attached to each of the files we create and to severe that connection isn&rsquo;t necessarily the easiest&hellip; you think I put so much work and effort into this how can I just toss it, or what if I have another project that this idea would be perfect for&hellip; that pack rat mentality seems to be very prevalent in the designer&rsquo;s life</p>

<p>The agency you are working for should make rules or at least guidelines which everyone have to use. I think any serious agency should do that, to be honest&hellip; :)</p>
<p>The agency I worked for had quite strict naming rules, and it worked like a charm. Also since the agency used a elaborate Certified PDF workflow, the RIP-servers also made files with a fixed naming system for easy recognition.
The system was mostly based on order number and next to that version number or date. That way we could search for files on a computer via order number or name, if something had to be changed or reprinted, and then it would show on which CD/DVD/Server the files were stored and they could be accessed.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more, and I was very surprised/disapointed to learn how disorganized this place is in regards to file/folder naming conventions. The good news is that the agency recognizes the problem, and is actively working towards a solution.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I simply make a folder with the clients name, marking it green (using Mac Os X) as to indicate that I am currently working for that particual client. Within the client&rsquo;s folder I make a folder with the project&rsquo;s short name. Say I am working in Illustrator. I begin by naming the file I am working on &ldquo;xxx_1.1.ai&rdquo;. Whenever I make any big changes I save that file again as &ldquo;xxx_1.2.ai&rdquo; and so on.</p>
<p>Withing the project folder I have a folder for all working material like unedited images, documents and other stuff. I usually call that folder &ldquo;Material&rdquo;. For images I import or place in the final project I have a folder called &ldquo;Images&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So lets say my client&rsquo;s name is Cacadoo and the project&rsquo;s name is Poster:</p>
<p><strong>Cacadoo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poster</strong>
&ndash; <strong>Images</strong>
&ndash; <em>Image1.eps</em>
&ndash; <em>Image2.eps</em>
&ndash; <strong>Material</strong>
&ndash; <em>Textforposter.txt</em>
&ndash; <em>Image1.jpg</em>
&ndash; <em>Image2.jpg</em>
<em>Poster_1.1.ai</em>
<em>Poster_1.2.ai</em>
<em>Poster_1.4.ai</em>
<em>Poster_1.5.ai</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Then when I am ready to send the file to print or the web developer I make a folder called &ldquo;Final&rdquo; and save my final document there as a PDF or .PSD.</p>
<p>Of course there a scenarios that are a bit more complicated but this is my basic principle of project organization.</p>
