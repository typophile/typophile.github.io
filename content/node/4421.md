  or <i>care</i> about good, mediocre, or even bad type? <BR> <BR>Personally, I know

  body: 'No one notices, at least not to the point that  they know they notice. Things
    can be taken too far and perfected to please the in-crowd, but I think readability
    is mostly subliminal. <BR> <BR>Just for example, a magazine I&#39;ve seen for
    years did a slight redesign a few months back. There was just a little more leading
    in the body copy, same font, same point size. I noticed it because they had also
    changed the headline font and some rules along the sides of the body copy. I showed
    it to my wife and she said she had particularly enjoyed that issue and read it
    more thoroughly than usual, and felt it was easier reading somehow but couldn&#39;t
    put her finger on it. So small things can make a difference without being highly
    noticeable. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a short answer: obviously no one cares as evidenced
    by the amount of comic sans being used anywhere and everywhere.'

  body: I agree.  Most may not care/know what it is but they certainly notice something,
    be it readability or gimmickry.  <BR> <BR>And they&#39;re certainly intrigued
    enough with fonts. You don&#39;t have to look far to find fliers, etc. crammed
    with 15 different, cutesy display faces. &#34;Oooh! I like that, that and that!&#34;  <BR>
    <BR>The end result may be a trainwreck but it&#39;s obvious somebody must&#39;ve
    noticed something or else the whole thing would&#39;ve been set in Times. <BR>
    <BR>Either way, once you become aware of good typography, there&#39;s no going
    back. Bad typography is as grating to the eye as mangled grammar is to the ear.

    &#40;or even realize&#41; what they&#39;re seeing doesn&#39;t mean it has no effect.

    <BR> <BR>The essence of discrimination lies in education. Although a couple of
    years ago straight quotes wouldn&#39;t have bothered you, you would probably find
    them distracting today. Similarly, a copy editor soon becomes put off by previously
    unnoticed &#34;mistakes&#34; in using &#34;which&#34; and &#34;that.&#34; To Westerners
    Chinese painting at first all looks alike, but one comes to recognize and appreciate
    Northern Song landscapes. Possible examples are endless. <BR> <BR>With the scandalous
    decline in education in this country &#40;the U.S.&#41; any sort of discrimination
    on any subject &#40;with the possible exception of pro wrestling&#41; is less
    and less likely. But there will still be people who notice, and care. <BR>'

  body: 'Interestingly, if you continue the WAD essay quoted by Kris, you&#39;ll find
    he goes on to say: <BR> <BR>&#34;By a remarkable paradox the one person who should
    not be called upon to perceive the fine qualities of the shapes of letters is
    the person who reads them. The person who reads printing should not be conscious
    that the page he reads is made up of letters. If any single character presents
    itself to his attention <i>as</i> a single character, the process of reading is
    disturbed. <BR> <BR>&#34;The kind of letter to which a reader is accustomed is
    the best kind of letter for the reader. But this fact must not be allowed to limit
    the effort of the designer toward better design. If the reader is used to bad
    design, he must be led to accustom himself to better design. It is at this point
    that the printer enters the equation.[&#42;] However little attention the reader
    needs to pay to the design of letters, it is obviously most necessary that the
    person who makes printing should be able to criticise and assess the qualities
    of letter forms.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#42; Keep in mind that when this was written &#40;1919&#41;,
    there wasn&#39;t yet a clearly distinct profession of &#34;graphic designer&#34;
    separate from the printer/compositor. In fact, it wasn&#39;t until a few years
    later that Dwiggins coined the term &#34;graphic design&#34;. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

  body: I don&#39;t think so, because the Crystal Goblet theory says that a text font
    can&#39;t express <i>anything</i>, while my view is that it expresses a lot, albeit
    mostly in the subconscious and not the consciousness. If you take the Crystal
    Goblet logic to its terminus, you have to conclude that we only need new text
    fonts to address [emergent] technical problems. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Well, I guess in turn I could be misinterpreting Warde; but from what I gather
    the &#34;must not&#34; comes from the &#34;cannot&#34;: the supposition is that
    a text font that tries to be expressive is no longer a text font. In the superficial,
    conscious meaning of &#34;expressive&#34; I might actually agree, but I can&#39;t
    be so dismissive of the receptiveness of the subconscious to visual stimuli. For
    example, I believe the shapes of the serifs in Charter versus Times make a difference
    in the mood they convey, but certainly Warde and company would consider both text
    faces. In truth, to me Times is actually less of a text face! But Warde &#40;and
    maybe even Morison&#41; could never see that. <BR> <BR>Then there&#39;s the issue
    of whether a human being can totally avoid expressing himself - in whatever small
    way. Sure, formalizing the expression and making it explicit leads away from Craft
    and towards Art, but when the creator and the consumer of something are both human,
    how can expression not be an ingredient? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    only does the average bear not notice the typography in a logo or product, but

    when setting type, make sure that it is relevant to the intrinsic inner logic
    of the &#39;text&#39;. I never understood it as meaning &#34;plain = good&#34;,
    I just thought she was warning against making it stupid, like setting a verse
    of poetry in Sand. It is impossible to not not communicate, and I find that I
    agree with Hrant about the subtle mood that any type will convey, even if it is
    supposedly for &#34;text&#34;. Maybe I misunderstood Mrs Warde! <BR> <BR>kris.

    &#40;the general idea of the text, although valid, always seemed sort of pompous

    feel a bit disappointed and cheated when people describe designers as just a conduit
