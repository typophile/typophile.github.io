  body: "I can't make an ID, I'm afraid, but I can offer some hope that it's a font
    - the like characters are mostly identical or with small mods, which could easily
    be ligatures or alternates.\r\n\r\nAlso of note is the fact that the type is used
    on Kristiansson's single \"Lilla London\" (http://www.tram7.se/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/anton_kristiansson_lilla_london.jpg),
    and seems to be accompanied by a simple variant of this decked-out face. This
    might indicate that the simple version is the flagship and the decorative version
    a member of the family.\r\n\r\nThat said, it's possible that it IS a font, but
    not a commercially available one. If no-one can make a positive ID, you might
    consider finding out who designed the album art and associated promo material
    and contacting them directly.\r\n\r\n-NJ\r\n\r\nEDIT: OK, here's a quote from
    the designers' Flickr page.\r\n\r\n\"Lundgren+Lindqvist designed Anton\u2019s
    full identity, including logotype, custom typography, web presence and the cover
    for his single \u2018Lilla London\u2019 (Little London).\"\r\n\r\nNo dice, then."
