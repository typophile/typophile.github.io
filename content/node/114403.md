  body: "I think if you search using \"geometric sans-serif\" you can find many candidates.
    The white lettering on a pale background makes it hard to judge the legs of the
    R, but [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans/?refby=bowfin|Museo
    Sans 700 or 900]] ought to be pretty close. The S curves and R legs will be the
    things to look for as long as the O is round.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The R and the O are right for Museo Sans, but the S is definitely wrong.
    My first guess is totally wrong, though: Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nFranklin Gothic does
    have the right R and S, but not the O, as noted.\r\n\r\nThe R and S are both wrong
    for Futura.\r\n\r\nSoin Sans gets all three basic shapes right, but I don't think
    it's the right one.\r\n\r\nWait; the low contrast had me mistaking the S.\r\n\r\nWhile
    Gill Sans was wrong, my instincts may have gotten me close. Look for a typeface
    more closely based on Johnston's original face for the London Underground. That
    matches all three shapes.\r\n\r\nHere's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/underground/|P22
    Johnston Underground]] for your inspection... no, that does not have the right
    R.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hurme-design/hurme-geometric-sans-3/|Hurme
    Geometric Sans 3]] also gets all three shapes right."

title: This is Forever -looking to find out the font for the white "IS FOREVER" portion
  of the print. I already know "this"=Modern No 20 & the White Ornamentals=Bergamot
  Ornament. Franklin Gothic Demi seems to be it, but not sure because of the "O".
  Thanks!
