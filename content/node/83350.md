body: "So the title says it all. I have an idea for a job I was asked to do and ideally
  it would require a monospaced typeface. Being a typophile, of course I didn't want
  just any monospaced typeface; it has to work nicely, as in, it has to make the \u201Cmonospace\u201D
  work. Usually the problem lies with wider characters like the M (lc and uc) and
  with lc F and R, for instance. So I'm looking for something you'd feel comfortable
  setting a paragraph or two in.\r\n\r\nAre there such things?\r\n\r\n(If it had small
  caps, that would be almost perfect; if on top of that it had a sans and serif version,
  that would be perfect.)"

    blank for a while and instead of searching or remembering I fell back on Typophile.
    And you delivered!\r\n\r\nOooo, an excuse to use Fedra\u2026\r\nInconsolata is
    pretty interesting.\r\nPanoptica could help the idea along great if it had both
    lc and uc forms for each letter, actually, but it might have too much personality.\r\nAnd
    Riccardo's suggestion could work too.\r\n\r\nThank you all kindly for the suggestions!"

    (optically) sized versions of the same glyph for upper and lower.\r\nSort of \"Unicase
    with Small Unicase\".\r\nBut that doesn't really work, as the minuscule forms
    look too strange as \"caps\" in mixed case setting, while the majuscule forms
    just look ordinary.\r\n\r\nThe whole point of Panoptica is that it solves the
    inconsistencies in width of a \"normal\" monospace font by means of unicase design."

  body: "(This Salvo Serif kicks ass.)\r\n\r\nI had never thought of that, Nick, that
    mixing monospace with unicase could help correct the problems that usually come
    along with monospaced faces; makes perfect sense.\r\n\r\nActually, some time ago
    I started a unicase sans-serif project which I then evolved into something along
    the lines of what I said about Panoptica, trying to make Uc and lc forms all in
    a unicase style. Indeed, wasn't easy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for other people searching
    for something similar to what I was looking for, try going through [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/monospaced/|Fontshop's
    lists of monospaced fonts]] as well (as I did once I conquered laziness). Very
    helpful."
