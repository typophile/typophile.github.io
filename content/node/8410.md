  body: Same to you Yves. Thanks for another year of fine service to your Typophile
    friends. <BR> <BR>BTW, you should give the colophon for your font art -- what
    is it, or do we have to ID this one too? <BR> <BR>Best wishes for 2005 to all
    Typophiles from here near Seattle, where it looks like we will be having a rainy
    day to start the new year.

  body: Yves, you are toying with us. That lettering is neither Oxtail, nor Sophisto
    &#40;which does include the hand icon you used for &#39;5&#39;&#41;, though it
    does match the Hitchhiker movie promo font. <BR> <BR>What is it, please?

    before, so that&#39;s why it bugged me. I&#39;m a Psy/Ops fan too.&#41;
