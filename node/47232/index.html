		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll get more than enough ammo here, because for starters, design execution aside, this &ldquo;logo&rdquo; says nothing to me about marketing. And the only reason it is saying &lsquo;sustainable&rsquo; is because it is throwing every cliche in the book out there (not that cliches are necessarily bad, after all they are immediately understood cultural elements, that, if used correctly and cleverly, can be wonderful springboards of communication). If I were to look at the logo, words aside, I would not know what the company does.</p>
<p>Secondly, it looks very amatuerish. The weights of the type, the &ldquo;lettered&rdquo; &lsquo;H&rsquo; &lsquo;M&rsquo; &lsquo;A&rsquo;, the number of similar yet different elements, it&rsquo;s all too much. WAY too much.</p>
<p>That said, if it is something they are attached to, I could see similar elements and &ldquo;inspiration&rdquo; being used to create a more evolved, more refined evolution of this mark.</p>
<p>Lastly, this mark would not inspire confidence in me to do business with this company. Especially to handle my marketing when it appears they cannot even market themselves properly.</p>

<p>Worst of all, it&rsquo;s just garish. Too busy, too many colors, too many fonts that don&rsquo;t match, too much scale between the letters, too many bad curves. Too much!</p>
<p>I work with environmental organizations all the time. It&rsquo;s a market full of extremists. I know instantly from a company identity if they&rsquo;re true professionals or just a bunch of idealists looking to earn enough money to buy pot and gas for their next week-long music festival. This logo says you&rsquo;re not even gonna make it to the festival across town, even stone-cold sober.</p>
<p>Please work hard to convince them to change this. There are far too many unprofessional hacks who want to be professional environmentalists to risk your company on a amateur logo. With a lame identity package, you&rsquo;ll be dismissed MUCH faster than in any other industry.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think you might want to capitalize on what Eileen said in her first paragraph:</p>
<p><cite>If you shrank this on to a business card, the tagline would be nothing but a choppy white blur. Furthermore, the M in Miller becomes two oddly spaced Ls because the connecting strokes are too thin. If you convert it to black and white, you’ll lose most of the first two words and I suspect the whole logo would look like it’s drowning.
</cite></p>
<p>This seems to be a clear argument against it which the the people who approved it could accept, while saving face. If you highlighted all the poor design ideas, you might put them on the defensive.</p>
<p>As I see it, the logo is unusable in most instances. Obviously it doesn&rsquo;t work at all in black and white, and would be difficult in grayscale too. Beyond that, if you sized it to use on business cards, stationery, envelopes, nearly any handheld sized printing application, the tag line would be too small to notice or read.
But when you blow the logo up to a sensible size to read the tagline, the &ldquo;H&rdquo; M&quot; and &ldquo;A&rdquo; become so large as to be distracting, and they separate from the rest of the name.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go with that argument rather than pointing out the poor overall design, it&rsquo;ll be easier to get everyone to see your point and agree with you.</p>

I usually like to be positive and uplifting, or at least non-committal and vague is something is not up to par, but this is just awful! On SOOOO many levels!

Just use a default typeface in WORD, make it a &ldquo;12 font&rdquo;  and you are good to go. Don&rsquo;t waste time and say you concepted - for Pete&rsquo;s sake - it will make you a laughing stock!</p>
<p>Artboy - you are so much better than this&hellip; the walls are speaking and they&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;Get Out!&rdquo;&hellip; but you know that already!
Godspeed!</p>

<p>For some inexplicable reason, the logo that was so &ldquo;hot&rdquo; to be produced has yet to have any files sent out for actual production, although there is a newly created Flash animation (think &ldquo;seaweed slapping farmers and hills&rdquo; to get a picture) that was done while I was vacationing with my family for three days last week (I&rsquo;m seeing a pattern here&hellip;).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that it&rsquo;s a bigger deal to me than it is to the owner. Good lord, it is <strong>ugly</strong>!</p>

<p>Looking at the logo, I have no idea what your company does. The only thing I would know about your company (other than the name) is that it&rsquo;s trying to piggyback on the &ldquo;being green&rdquo; fad. The colors are terrible and please tell me why the two background swashes are transparent? (seen in the section where they overlap.)</p>
<p>Talk about a 300 pound gorilla . . . this has to be the ugliest most unmanageable rectangular block of a logo I have seen in a long while. It doesn&rsquo;t even deserve to be nitpicked or modified in any way. It simply needs to be tossed.</p>

<p>Nothing, repeat NOTHING has been produced (thank God!) to this point, and we&rsquo;re (I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; as if I&rsquo;m somehow actually involved in the process – it still hasn&rsquo;t been handed over to me for fixing as yet) going round and round with faint variations of it, asking everyone under the sun if they like it with blue swooshes and any of sixteen more typefaces from which to choose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to have the opportunity to unceremoniously burn all copies, discs, and printouts of it in a huge bonfire on the front lawn of our business complex, dancing shirtless and chanting barely intelligible names of typefaces that should join the inferno (&ldquo;Souvenir!&rdquo; &ldquo;Brush Script!&rdquo; &ldquo;The entire Korinna family!&quot;). Hope springs eternal.</p>

I took the liberty (and the timely advice of some contributors here) to make changes and improvements to the most recent round of logos and created a workable logo and color palette. It&rsquo;s not what would have developed through a more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; course of action, but I think the end result (considering the constraints, and we&rsquo;ve all had to deal with those!) is a vast improvement over what was going to be the &ldquo;final&rdquo; version I showed earlier.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dear Artboy</p>
<p>After reading every post I felt like I needed to comment but for the first time I found myself totally out of words. But returning today, I have a few. Thank you for stepping up to your job as a creative director. I felt your posts was kinda joking with the whole concept and that sort of pissed me off a little. You should have forced your way into this with a pencil in every hand and set people straight - as your jobtitle would demand. I&rsquo;m sure you could have made 10 new logo sketches in one day that would have been better&hellip; a lot better! Your companys profile would have taken a beating and eventually your own job would be threaten. The owner of your company hired you because you knew something about graphic design that he himself didn&rsquo;t and the fact that he didn&rsquo;t even take his own companys profile so serious - just scares the hell out of me. I&rsquo;m leaning towards the cries for you to leave this company ASAP&hellip; You coming here shows you care.</p>
<p>You certainly made a better logo for the company but I agree with the other post that it&rsquo;s webish and the word Associates is disturbed by the graphics.</p>
<p>In scandinavian design we have a saying &ldquo;keep it simple&rdquo;&hellip; I would suggest you try that. Remove what are not important and go ahead and save the day!</p>
<p>You can do it - because you care</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This whole topic of discussion is deeply disturbing to me. I myself have been in a similar situation as a Web Developer/Graphic Designer. I am no longer with the company. Think of it this way. Would a company who hired an accountant or a production manager or an editor trust those people&rsquo;s duties to an intern? I would certainly hope not. People should be (in a RESPONSIBLE company) hired for a reason and given a clear description of job duties- which are not to be shared with others hired for separate reasons.</p>
<p>You were hired in as the expert in your area, and if you need &ldquo;help&rdquo; designing a logo, it should be left to YOU ALONE to delegate that assignment to someone YOU trust to help with YOUR job. If you are not allowed the responsibility to delegate your own work to those which you (as the expert) trust, then you are obviously not valued as the expert and your company should question why they hired you, if they cannot trust you as the expert to delegate your own work. You need to make them realize this. Let them know how important it is to allow department experts to delegate work from their own departments. Explain to them that nobody is an expert in everything, and the company NEEDS specialized experts in all fields in order to succeed. And in order for those experts to do the best jobs they can do - they NEED to be trusted.</p>
<p>The advice you should give this company you work for should be: &ldquo;Do not hire anyone you do not trust more than yourself in the area they are being hired into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not everyone is trained to think critically about design, and how the way things look affect a company&rsquo;s image - and in what ways. Anyone can have an opinion, but designers look beyond what &ldquo;looks good&rdquo; because designing is a strategic process, to achieve what a company, or a client is trying to achieve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d definitely give them a chance to &ldquo;change their ways&rdquo;, but if they don&rsquo;t understand the simple concept of job specialization by now, chances are, they never will. GET OUT of that place - It&rsquo;s going to go down in flames!</p>

<p>I am happy to report that I have a new job at a new company in a different line of work. Design should definitely be left to the experts, and when it is not — it is truly time to move on.</p>
<p>As I have done.</p>
