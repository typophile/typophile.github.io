Anything that is digital can be copied. No amount of 'copy protection' will protect the physical act of pirating and will only piss off all of the honest users.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The solution we can use is called copyright law. It's not ideal, but it's what we have. If you truly are loosing a large amount of sales to a pirate, then you call up the lawyers and act. Yes, this favors the Adobes and RIAAs of the world&hellip;not the guy sitting in the basement making fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I still stand behind my belief that the best solution is simply to cater to your honest consumers. Educate people on piracy issues the best you can, and hope that your product is good enough to encourage enough to purchase. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is where the RIAA is failing. They are neither providing very good product these days, and they aren't even willing to let me purchase what I want (and, on top of that, they sue their own consumers).

		<div class="commentbody">Darrel wrote: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bad knock-offs, I think, are probably the most damaging, as they appear legit, and, technically, may be, but they harm the the integrity of the original work.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, that's very true. When students see a free font that has 'Univers' in its name, they automatically assume that it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> indeed Univers, but what they're most likely to get is a hotchpotch of different sanserifs, including a Gill Sans g! (That actually happened before). Knockoffs are already problematic in the commercial font business, it is even harder to pin down in the public domain. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joseph D. Treacy wrote: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For instance, a large number of the users of pirate font software copies are people who work in the graphic arts. It's often art directors and also production workers at service bureaus. That's been well known since the dawn of desktop publishing.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's a sad fact. While it's not uncommon to find designers complain about their designs being knocked off or copied by other designers, the majority of desingners are the ones who don't show any respect to intellectual properties when it comes to type designs. Typeface design is such a thankless job. Graphic designers rarely even give credit to the typeface used, never mind the type designer. Why would they even reveal the name of the typeface they used when they didn't even pay for it?! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Honestly, I don't see any cut-and-dry way to solve the font piracy problem. Only education can solve it, I think. I really shouldn't tell you this, but I've had an instructor who made a Zip disk full of fonts available for us to use/copy. Now that's really unethical, and it is terribly damaging to the type business. It makes it normal for designers to copy and pass around fonts. Most people here (I assume) won't even dream of pirating fonts. Why? We are just conscientious? We simply appreciate the beauty of typefaces, respect the talents of those who designed them, and understand how much work it takes to design and produce a great typeface. Only when the these values and artistic appreciation abilities are imparted to the students would they stop pirating fonts. These are acquired skills, and can be learnt. Students have to understand that they don't need every single typeface in the world at their fingertips to do great designs. They have to understand a good type library has to be built gradually, over time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We are at a transitional period right now, with OpenType, PostScript and TrueType all coexisting and for many, the anxiety over Quark vs InDesign and OSX vs OS9. In the fall, my school will have InDesign 2 on all the Macs over in the Design Department. But, we don't have a single OpenType font! As much as I want to use InDesign with OpenType fonts exclusively for the class, it's going to take a while for the students to make the switch over. So I still have to cover Type 1 vs TrueType, expert sets and the like, and at least give them a taste of OpenType features. A lot of students will be working at home, some will be using PCs. Where on earth could they find decent typefaces to work with? As much as I want them all to go get a copy of Type Classics for Learning, I really can't make them do that. Already they'll have to get a couple of required texts, storage media, pay for printing, supplies and presentation material, how can I convince them to spend another $100 on type that may or may not work with the software they'll be working with? I'm trying to get the school to buy a site license for Type Classics for Learning, but that's going to take at least a semester, or even a year. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Earls wrote: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Far better, I think, to put your philosophies into practice. Work on opensource or freeware lines and prove to people that there is room for more than one philosophical standpoint on property. Create a typeface of worth and use that will stand the test of time, and give it away, or dare to think of alternative licensing schemes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, alternative licensing schemes. I personally think that we should have access to each and every font available commercially at any given time (perhaps over the web). So we could test them on our own layouts and to show clients. Once we've decided that we want to use it for a particular project, we would then pay the foundry. That would be a very attractive licensing scheme. But I guess it would only encourage more pirates, unless we have a tracking system in place. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Type design is not a multi-million business. A lot of foundries are one-person operations. The economic return is quite minimal compared to say advertising, or even editorial design work. Yet the effort one has to put into a type design is enormous. We do it, because we love it. There's no question about it. Kudos to people like Victor Gaultney, who's making such an exquisite, extensive and useful text face available to the public. They always have my greatest respect.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Keith Tam today asked <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Do any of you know if other foundries have  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;educational pricing? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Er&hellip;Treacyfaces does. And has for years. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had recently mentioned on another page: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;ordering four from us, one receives: Family volume discount which lops off about 16% on a purchase of four fonts, then the second version discount taking off the next 50%.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you're a student or educator, you receive 50% off of all of the above. If you quote the current discount code on our home page, another discount applies. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I didn't say before was that scenario only discussed four fonts. With larger orders (for instance, dozens or hundreds), the cost savings are even more significant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->James Montalbano said <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;How can you assume that $100 an hour provides a decent profit. Have you ever heard of studio overhead? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quite so, Jim.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'd venture to say that a number of those who dabble in font making, still living at home with mommy and daddy and accessing this list from their hacked XBox have no idea of professional office overhead. (Say, you remixers out there should try it sometime. Like adventure? Intrigue? Reality shows? It's all there. But, oops! There's a catch: you have to join the real world!) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(To those on this list who do work professionally, of course, you're excluded from that diatribe.)  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And do you know that in most markets, even midwest USA, a graphic design rate of $100./hr is in essence a rate from 1982 or so*? (I see the Disney Channel News Hour tells me that the cost of living has gone up since 1982. *I have always tended to regard my own design rate as being at the top end of the range generally quoted by organizations like Graphic Artists Group in compensation reports. That may or may not work for everybody, depending on skill level and market.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Still, I know that quite a few freelancing graphic designers, even in larger urban markets, charge much less.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And in this economy, I understand that even in markets like Seattle, they're giving creative away.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's quite sad right now (for the past three to four years, really) for graduates entering the business, as well as for everyone else slaving away in it, trying to deliver credible, forward thinking work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand, it can be said that there is a lot of mediocre to simply awful creative out there (yes, even besides the relentlessly ill-conceived stock photo industry print ads!). Such 'creative' probably is worth less. (I generally assume that the creative people who do stock photo industry print ads pay the client to run the work&hellip;.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->;-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, graduates, yes, there is opportunity! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But remember: One way to improve the intrinsic value of creative is (ahem) using high quality fonts in your design and execution. But probably equally important is making type selections that really are unique. Type that's both relevant to topic **and** rarely seen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting excited about a package of 400 fonts that all your colleagues will have, just as with making use of OS fonts or bundled fonts, makes little sense for the graphic designer or art director, competitively. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interesting. A belief that everything should be free does have a way of coming back to bite you. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; studio overhead <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nobody can deny that a studio -especially one in a prime location like James's- has a lot of overhead. But the question is, how valuable is a studio in the first place, especially these days? Sure, there's nothing like physical human contact, but it's not indispensable. Type design in particular has extremely low production and iteration costs. My biggest font-related client right now is an institution I've never even visited, via a contact I've never seen or even heard on the phone. And most significantly, I could be doing that project -and many of the other projects I've done over the past 3 years- while living anywhere in the world with a decent internet connection. And in many such places $100/hr is an astronomical rate - you could live like a king! For example, monthly rent in a very nice 2-bedroom apartment in Yerevan is about $200. Plus if you need to physically visit a client once in a while, about ten hours of work at $100 will get you there and back via Heathrow no problem! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So when you think of rates, don't limit the equation to working in midtown Manhattan, or even anywhere in the West. Why do you think Bangalore is exploding with employment right now? This ain't Kansas anymore. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; you have to join the real world! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Different things are real to different people - to me there's nothing real about working like a slave most of your waking like and wasting your weekends resting like a vegetable. And it depends what you want. If your involvement in type design revolves around simply making money (to spend on whatever, or to retire in physical comfort) then you invest what you need to establish the facade some old-fashioned, old-money clients might require. But if you want to be remembered by future generations (the way Gutenberg and Garamond are, even though they died paupers), a studio and a library of 70s throwbacks won't do jackshit for you. Most of what you need to be remembered (as opposed to die rich) is totally free - although certainly not easy to get. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
