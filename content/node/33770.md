  body: "When I installed CS2, it appears to have installed a Korean font called Adobe
    Myungjo Std M that has both hangul and hanja. Check your installer; it's probably
    in there somewhere.\r\n\r\nAs for typing, I just checked; it appears to be simple
    enough to type Korean in an English-language ID CS2; just select a Korean font
    and keyboard layout. The hangul letters form into blocks, and it puts up a little
    palette thing at the bottom that makes me suspect it can do hanja, but I don't
    know enough Korean to test that out (hanja shouldn't be needed for most documents
    anyway). It would probably be faster, though, to do the typing in a text processor
    and then place it in ID.\r\n\r\nAnd it doesn't know how to handle line breaks
    etc. for Korean, so everything would have to be proofread very carefully."
