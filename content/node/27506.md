  but am now taking the plunge.\r\n\r\nIt's rare that sport and typography come together
  but these new Australian soccer jerseys have been a talking point amongst even typographic
  novices. What is the face used in the names and numbers? Weirdly, there are many
  dying to know.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ccmariners.com.au/_content/image/00003902-image.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://www.geocities.com/sydneyfc06/brosque2b.jpg"

  body: "Hi Phormic, \r\nit is more like: when sports and money collide. Almost all
    big sportsbrands now have their custom designed typefaces to keep the merchandising
    money in the pocket. \r\n\r\nSo, as a start, have a look at <a href=\"http://www.metro-sport.com/\">this
    website</a> for example, to see how many leagues are playing with licenced typefaces. "
