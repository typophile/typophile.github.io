  body: Sorry for the big gif but I wished to show you how odd this can became with
    a text face. <BR>Note the uncial f. <BR>By the way, I love Pumpernickel. I started
    some ten years ago something very similar, scanning household items and found
    objects, but I dropped it. Pumpernickel is really prettier than Paul Elliman&#39;s
    Bits, for example &#40;in an issue of FUSE&#41;. <BR>I would love to work on a
    collaborative face like Silentmail. I would just try to keep more control &#40;in
    Silentmail each following student was allowed to look only at the previous six
    characters and not at the whole&#41;.

    Bits, from FUSE issue 15. I recalled it worse. <BR>Actually it&#39;s very good
    as Pumpernickel. It rocks, too. Besides, it&#39;s been one of the first &#40;if
    not the first&#41; face designed with found objects. <BR>It has a pretty complete
    character set, which is unusual for a FUSE face. <BR> <BR>Silentmail inspires
    me a lot. I would like to attempt a cooperative text face, using better starting
    rules. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4999.gif"

  body: Actually your Pumpernickel maybe is less original/flamboyant than Bits, but
    more readable. My idea with &#34;Ger&uuml;mpel&#34;, the face I started with found
    objects, was to design a text face with them. <BR>You could try this with Pumper...
    or we may try together.

  body: '&#62; [I have two &#34;definitions&#34; of text fonts. One is closer to yours
    is related to book usage, the other includes experiments which eventually someone
    could dare to use in text, like my Neoritmo. I talked with Nick Shinn about this
    and he shares my idea. His Merlin, for example, is conceived as a text face, albeit
    overcharged with decoration. And I think his intention with Fontesque was the
    same, although Fontesque really does not work.]'

  body: 'Hrant first &#40;like Women and Child ;&#41; <BR>I have not explained myself
    well. I meant Fontesque does not work if we consider it in what I called faces
    for book usage. <BR>As far as we are in my second and generic category &#40;experiments
    for someone who might dare to use in text&#41; many faces work at different degrees
    depending on how much you dare and on the complessive length of the text. <BR>An
    example is the use of Outwest as a textface in Emigre 28. I find it fantastic
    but it could turn your stomach upside down. And it&#39;s not for book usage. So
    I just meant that, if you&#39;re very daring Merlin could even be used in a book
    but Fontesque probably not. <BR>It all depends on the context to me. <BR> <BR>For
    Tor: thank you! <BR>I should have to see if objects I found for my old Ger&uuml;mpel
    are still there. Then we may extablish proportions and start digitizing and make
    selections for the lowercases &#40;I always start from the more problematic lowercases&#41;.
    <BR>As for the sound project: do you know Voxel by Joshua Distler at Shift?: it&#39;s
    not what you are proposing but it&#39;s an experiment linking sound to graphic
    forms. I have it, Joshua is a friend of mine. You may see Voxel here: <BR><a href="http://www.shiftype.com/"
    target="_blank">http://www.shiftype.com/</a> <BR> <BR>About your idea: short sounds
    but... any kind of sound? I like the idea but I find the found objects one more
    fun! <BR>Send me a private mail from my profile page. <BR> <BR>Cheers! <BR>'
