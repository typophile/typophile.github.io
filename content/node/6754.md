  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;It&#39;s neat, but the graphic
    seems to me to be misleading. The impression the graphic gives is that a bullet
    travels at roughly 1/3 of the speed of light, a plane at around 1/4 and a car
    at around 1/10. <BR> <BR>This is nonsense. Taking your figures, a bullet actually
    travels at around 1/25,000 of the speed of light. <BR> <BR>Or, put differently,
    your chart makes it look like after one second a bullet fired from a handgun would
    be nearly halfway to the moon, and a car would be an appreciable way there. But
    depending on the date it would take &#40;by my rough calculation&#41; around 34,000
    seconds &#40;around 9 hours&#41; for an object going at a constant 25,000 mph
    to make it to the moon. So after a second a bullet is not 1/3 of the way there,
    it&#39;s about 1/34,000 of the way there. It&#39;s the equivalent for a bullet
    to 1 second on the journey from London to New York is for a person. And as for
    the car ... <BR> <BR>I doubt you can produce any sort of chart which will meaningfully
    compare something travelling at around 7 miles per second with something travelling
    at around 180,000 miles per second. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think that the perspective
    scale makes it OK. The size of the markers for planes and so forth don&#39;t respect
    the scale &#40;your car is about 100 times the size of earth&#41;. And if anything
    it has the opposite effect, because it makes it look like the objects at the torch
    end have actually gone further than a regular scale would suggest they had, in
    other words the perspective is going in the wrong direction for these purposes.&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: In my opinion, you should specify that you are using a logarithmic scale!!  <BR>If
    not, people don&#39;t understand why a bullet travelling 25000 MPH is halfway
    to the moon.

  body: I don&#39;t think that specifying a logarithmic scale will make it OK, for
    two reasons. <BR> <BR>1. This is a graphic. Specifying a log scale would make
    it honest, but the instinctive reaction to the scale would still be wrong. As
    a graphic it would not be doing its job. <BR> <BR>2. The perspective would have
    to be reversed. As it stands, the impression given by the perspective &#40;earth
    small and distant, moon large and near, plus the circular scale bands&#41; is
    that 1cm of &#34;graphic&#34; movement near the torch is &#42;more&#42; &#34;on
    the ground&#34; than 1cm of graphic movement near the moon, but the log scale
    would have to be quite the reverse for this to work. <BR> <BR>Perhaps with an
    explicitly log scale and a reversal of the perspective &#40;so we viewed it from
    the earth/torch end&#41; the impression might be better. But I doubt it can be
    made quite right.

  body: Just a quick observation, it looks like the graph and the flashlight don&#39;t
    line up in perpsective.
