  is the light weight that has suffered particularly from this stop/start process.
  I can't remember how many times I've wished I'd written concise notes so that I
  could pick up from where I left off.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I would sincerely appreciate
  your comments, both on the forms and the spacing, since both require some work.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\nMiles\r\nwww.newlyn.com"

    a follower of Unger's sanses (though less modulated) and that's a good thing.\r\n\r\n-
    On your 'Kk' the thin connection of the diagonals to the vertical is a little
    awkward. I feel it should be heavier or not touch at all.\r\n\r\n- I think the
    'y' tail is a little too long.\r\n\r\n- 'r' is excellent\r\n\r\n- The char set
    showing is missing an 'H'\r\n\r\n- A few of your mathematical symbols are too
    heavy (\u2264\u2265\xB1)"

    it's instructive to try :>\r\nI think the left sidebearing on the n, and/or u
    is slightly too wide. Or is it the right side on the a?\r\nThere is something
    about the bowl on the a that doesn't quite flow...looks too wide or perhaps just
    needs a slightly different shoulder? \r\nI agree about the y tail, perhaps the
    curve needs to start higher, like on the g?\r\nThe curly brackets on p.5 need
    more breathing space.\r\nThe idiaresis and odiaresis dots are low flying, and
    something funny with the contours of the question mark dot makes it disappear
    on small sizes (double contour?)\r\nI love Q, R, S and the numbers."

  body: I understand why Stephen suggested pulling the legs away from the body on
    the Kk. But I, personally, don't like separation if I have to use in display work.
    I actually preferred the last version. But, they are working better for smaller
    size use. I wonder if the bottom bowl of the B and the bottom of the C aren't
    sticking out a hair too much? I really think this strikes a good balance in between
    something conservative like Myriad and more daring like Klavika.

    For stability, the lower leg could move out two or three units I think. \r\n\r\nI
    think the dots on i and j are right to line up with the cap height, but that gap
    does look wide. Perhaps the cap height could be dropped ever so slightly to accommodate
    the i and j? I don't think it should go anywhere near the t height.\r\n\r\nTop

  body: "Very attractive letters. I like the openness of the counters and how you
    terminate letters like the 'S' and 'C' with horizontal strokes\u2014I'm attempting
    to bring similar elements into my own face. I think I came across another weight,
    or an earlier version of this, several months ago. I don't think I commented then
    because all I had to offer was unspecified praise. Now that I can put my finger
    on what strikes my fancy, I'll offer up my thoughts.\r\n\r\nMy eye is drawn to
    the contrasting forms on the terminals\u2014how the interior is flat while the
    exterior is curved. I think this works best on the 'a', 'e', and '1'. The question
    mark is particularly attractive, as are the guillemettes and ampersand. It really
    gets under my skin when typefaces have weak, awkward, or otherwise bothersome
    punctuation (See: the question mark on Futura Medium).\r\n\r\nThere are a few
    places where the modulation of the stroke weight bothers me, particularly the
    'r'. The fact that the arm of the 'r' is flat all the way across the bottom, which
    I absolutely love, makes the stroke noticeably thin where it joins the vertical
    stroke. Oddly enough, I first thought this was because the stroke of the arm was
    too heavy\u2014making the joint look weak in comparison. It wasn't until I zoomed
    in closer that I realized that the joint was the problem and not the arm's weight.
    Also, the modulation on the Q feels a touch extreme. I could see tapering the
    tail more to give some room for the bowl to maintain a little more weight.\r\n\r\nQuite
    delicious all-in-all."

  body: "Miles, this seems like the long-awaited maturation of this highly\r\ncontemporary
    style that's been brewing for a few years - good going!\r\n\r\nI haven't read
    all of the feedback from others in this thread, so I might be repeating things
    (or ignoring changes already made) but here is some feedback:\r\n\r\nI like the
    narrowness of the font - it seems essential in making this style sing.\r\n\r\nI
    would make the descenders a bit shorter.\r\n\r\nThe bowl of the \"a\" seems to
    need a little bit more modulation, to harmonize more with that funky characteristic
    thickening in this design (like at the top of the \"a\" itself).\r\n\r\nThe lefthand
    side of the bar of the \"f\" is sticking out a bit too much I think.\r\n\r\nTry
    your hand at a bi \"g\"?\r\n\r\nAs others seem to have opined, the tittle of the
    \"i\"/\"j\" isn't there yet. Often it's useful to align it with the top of the
    \"t\"; so in this case I might either raise the dot even higher* (aligning its
    bottom with the top of the \"t\", and its top with the full ascenders), or I might
    center the dot at the height of the \"t\" (in which case you could align its top
    with the caps, which is useful).\r\n\r\n* In fact such a -hopefully sufficiently
    gentle- idiosyncrasy might become the \"signature\" of this font.\r\n\r\nThe \"k\"
    might be fine, but it might be a bit narrow, and it might also need a hair more
    flair, like making the arms uneven somehow. Like Tiffany I'm ambivalent about
    separation in a \"k\", but I actually think it's usually better in display than
    text!\r\n\r\nThe \"r\" and \"s\" rule.\r\n\r\nThe bottom terminal of the \"y\"
    is a bit unconvincing (although there might not be much room for change; note
    that shortening the descenders would give more room).\r\n\r\nI would stagger the
    arms of the \"x\", even if it doesn't really need it optically - it would give
    the glyph more flavor, instead of looking like a math symbol.\r\n\r\nThe top join
    of the \"ae\" needs to be modulated lighter.\r\n\r\nThe ampersand is very nice,
    except for the top-right arm, which seems too straight and/or long.\r\n\r\nThe
    width and height of the caps is right on.\r\n\r\nI'd make the \"D\" slightly wider.\r\n\r\nWould
    the \"E\" look better with a shorter middle bar?\r\n\r\nThe bar in the \"G\" is
    distracting close-but-not-aligned with the bars of the \"E\", \"H\" etc. Since
    raising it might be too much, I'd probably lower it.\r\n\r\nThat wide \"J\" will
    give you trouble, especially in some parts of Eastern Europe...\r\n\r\nThe cap
    \"K\" seems OK as it is, even the separation.\r\n\r\nThe \"M\" is super.\r\n\r\nIf
    you keep the slight trapping in the \"N\" some other glyphs will need it too of
    course.\r\n\r\nThe \"Q\" is exceptional - although the tail is just a bit too
    heavy I think.\r\n\r\nThe curve of the \"U\" seems a bit light.\r\n\r\nThe \"X\"
    seems fine as is in the caps.\r\n\r\nThe vertical of the \"AE\" seems unsually
    thin.\r\n\r\nI would put small nicks at the top and bottom joins of the \"OE\".
    I've always liked that, and it's becoming more acceptable lately (especially in
    a sans).\r\n\r\nAlso: I like the cedilla; the tilde seems out of character; the
    eszet is too wide; the cap Thorn could have a larger bowl towards the bottom;
    the numerals are mostly nice, except the \"5\" is slightly narrow and the \"2\"
    need some sort of fix; the Pound could benefit from a shorter top; the Yen isn't
    happy - I'd lower the bar; can you make the Section not lean to the right?\r\n\r\nIs
    the Italic mechanical? If so that might be a good start, but the one thing that
    bothers me is the slant: way too much. I think contemporary fonts look much nicer
    with a gentle slant (although that does require the Italic to be pulled away from
    the Roman more in other ways).\r\n\r\nSpacing: since this a light font it will
    typically be used large, so the spacing probably needs to be a bit tighter.\r\n\r\nOverall
    very tantalizing - good luck finish it soon!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
