  body: "It's hard to know what to make of Ludwig. I have too much respect for Fred
    to dismiss it without seeing it in print, but the web showing isn't inspiring.
    Is that really how it is spaced?\r\n\r\n[The <em>Vancouver Sun</em> newspaper
    has just rolled out a redesign, and they're using an incredibly loosly spaced
    sans for subheads. Maybe 2009 will be the year of the sans-you-can-drive-a-truck-through.]"

  body: "Goran, \r\nperhaps it's worth having a second look. Flash does not use the
    original spacing, not for Ludwig, nor any other typeface on that site. \r\n\r\nSo,
    what qualifies it as an early 1st of April joke? The fact that this design that
    is less generic? or its obvious 'historical' perfume? If I look at all designs
    Fred ever did [part of them in [[http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-24-4|Type
    Now]], there is a great variety in styles and challenges. Like it or not, he never
    did much of the same over and over again, on the contrary - he defied the fear
    for uncharted waters. So, in this line of thought, I wouldn't dismiss Ludwig just
    for the simple fact that I [or you] did not expect something in that direction
    [= a design that is out of someone's comfort zone]...\r\n\r\n[[http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/music/morton_feldman_jazz_tributes|Hyphen
    Press Music]] adopted Ludwig [together with Arnhem] for their identity; I bet
    EMI or SONY records would never do that. A recent Elmgreen & Dragset catalogue
    [[http://www.hatjecantz.de/controller.php?cmd=detail&titzif=00002050|by Hatje
    Cantz]] features Ludwig quite nicely, too. So maybe it's not for everyone, and
    everything... But then, besides Helvetica, what is?"

  body: "Oh, I looked in the PDF, and the type is \"loosely\" spaced there also.\r\n\r\nBut
    honestly if I offended anyone I'm sorry, my intention was not make any harm with
    my quick statement, just a reflection. Probably stupid of me. "

  body: It seems almost like the stems were spaced as if they were seriffed. Given
    the stated objective of the design, this might not be far off. In his Quadraat,
    for example, the vertical stems are spaced with a distance nearly equal to the
    counter widths. A similar approach seems to have been taken with Ludwig, even
    though it is a sans.
