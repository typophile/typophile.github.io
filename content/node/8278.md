  body: The lower one appears to be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-fenice/bold/testdrive.html?s=SPORTS+%26+LEISURE&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">ITC Fenice Bold</a>. The upper one is extremely distorted, but,
    based on the general construction of the letters, appears to be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times-new-roman/ps/testdrive.html?s=YELLOW+MARKET&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Times Roman</a> stretched, stroked and with who knows what other
    effects applied.
