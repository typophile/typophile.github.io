body: Hello <BR>I&#39;m starting to design a new type, but I&#39;m not sure if I have
  seen something alike. Does anyone know of type that looks similar or even the same???
  <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/42955.jpg"

  body: Your new type consists of / is based on pretty simple, geometric shapes, so
    I am pretty sure that there are similar ones out there, even if I can actually
    name none of them right now.. <i>But I am going to start seeking some now..</i>

    Gothic Gothic</a> by Grieshaber. <BR>Of course, the proportions are completely
    different.

  body: Thanks Scott... I really liked this type, but wasn&#39;t really sure if it
    was worth doing something that maybe wasn&#39;t so original.  <BR>I will give
    it a try and see what comes out of it. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I thank you all for the
    suport  <BR>

  body: I like the look of the drawings you posted; though on the other hand David
    is right that there are scads of geometric/grid faces out there. <BR> <BR>Maybe
    you could distinguish your face by doing a clean&#60;--&#62;rough/distressed axis,
    instead of the usual light&#60;--&#62;bold or condensed&#60;--&#62;extended axes.
    I think part of what can make these geometric faces all feel the same is that
    they often have razor-clean lines and angles, which comes across as sterile and
    soulless half the time, at least to me. If you had a clean, idealized version,
    but also versions that had the warmer look of your hand drawings, I&#39;d want
    a copy.
