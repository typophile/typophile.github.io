body: "Hello, moved by the curiosity for the recent Flagsmith, I was just practising
  by playing around with OpenType on a dingbat font and I was trying to have a symbol
  (called \"logo\") splitting in its component by adding \"-div\" behind the name
  of the logo. So, for instance, \"logo-div\".\r\nGiven the logo \"logo\" and its
  four components:\r\n\r\nlogo.alt001\r\nlogo.alt002\r\nlogo.alt003\r\nlogo.alt004\r\n\r\nI
  was looking at the Flagsmith and I therefore coded in the \"liga\" feature:\r\n\r\n
  \t<code>\r\n  \tsub l' o g o hyphen d i v by logo.alt001;\r\n  \tsub logo.alt001
  o' g o hyphen d i v by logo.alt002;\r\n  \tsub logo.alt001 logo.alt002 g' o hyphen
  d i v by logo.alt003;\r\n  \tsub logo.alt001 logo.alt002 logo.alt003 o' hyphen d
  i v by f_glyph;\r\n  \tsub logo.alt001 logo.alt002 logo.alt003 f_glyph hyphen' d
  i v by f_glyph;\r\n\tsub logo.alt001 logo.alt002 logo.alt003 f_glyph f_glyph d'
  i v by f_glyph;\r\n\tsub logo.alt001 logo.alt002 logo.alt003 f_glyph f_glyph f_glyph
  i' v by f_glyph;\r\n\tsub logo.alt001 logo.alt002 logo.alt003 f_glyph f_glyph f_glyph
  f_glyph v' by logo.alt004;\r\n\t</code>\r\n\r\nand it works. But in this way I can't
  have\r\n \t\r\n \t<code>\r\n\tsub l o g o by logo;\r\n\t</code>\r\n\r\nanymore,
  in order to also have the chance to insert the entire glyph \"logo\".\r\nI already
  tried to find a solution on my own and I can image that the reason is that the two
  parts are now conflicting. What could be a good way to solve it?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n"
