body: "I've juste finished watching the latest Wes Anderson movie, <em>The Darjeeling
  Limited</em>, and was wondering what was the font used for the movie titles, poster
  and end credit (see attachment). It looks like something between Gotham and Neutraface,
  but I just can't quite put my finger on it. I'm not really looking for the fancy
  cutout version used for the titles, but just the general letterform. Can anyone
  please help me ?\r\n\r\n(See the film, by the way, it's true Wes Anderson like we
  like it. For those who like him, at least)"

    to find it in the formatting options...

    anyway. I tried searching the forums but Darjeeling Limited returned no results."

  body: Weird -- the search returns <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20darjeeling%20limited">more
    than enough results</a>. How exactly did you search?
