  body: I like both, to me the first one are the one I would choose as the main letters.
    However, you could use the second one in an alt glyphs. Personally I would close
    the bottom of the bowl of the R.

  body: I'd also prefer the first ones - the roundings fit more to the 'free' lines
    of the /y/ and /a/.

    \r\nThat has precedents; see for example [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/plantin/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D105%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DPR%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D24|Plantin]]. "
