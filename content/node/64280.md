  popular movie Paranormal Activity. Does anyone know what font is being using for
  the title? Make sure to have a good look at the 't'. \r\n\r\nSomething quite similar
  will be fine too.\r\n\r\nYou can se more here: http://www.paranormalactivity-movie.com/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/paranormal_font_3965.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: "That's a very good suggestion, but I think it will take some work to make
    it look alike. The font in the title seems lower and more square, and it looks
    a bit like the angle in the 'T' is more rounded in the bottom, than in Kautika?
    But that could be the Photoshopping, I guess.\r\n\r\n"

    it seems horizontally stretched to me."
