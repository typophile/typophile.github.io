body: "I'm looking for some suggestions for condensed and/or compressed grotesques
  for use in an contemporary art festival. At this stage it feels right for the project,
  with the creative in it's infancy. I'm well aware of the Champion and Knockout families
  but am looking for something perhaps less common. Liking the idea of having a cold,
  machine quality without becoming tech.\r\n At the moment I've played with Compacta,
  Compacta Light, Univers condensed Plak and a few others. There's a degree of the
  off-beat nature of plak that also seems in line with the contemporary art work.
  A couple of refs:\r\n\r\nQuite liking the look of [[http://commercialtype.com/news/updates/druk_for_ibloomberg_businessweeki|Druk]]\r\n\r\nAlso
  love the identity of NYC Opera by 2x4 [[http://2x4.org/work/7/New+York+City+Opera/|here]]\r\n\r\nAnd
  sort of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/railroad-gothic-rr/|rail road
  gothic]]\r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing some words of wisdom from the experienced
  to the inexperienced!"

    think Tungsten is a little tech, but has of the right flavour for sure.\r\n\r\nDon't
    think it needs to exclusively be grotesques.\r\n\r\nPlease keep em comin!\r\n"

  body: I believe Graphik is (or used to be) available on request. Also, I think Steile
    Futura in it's many variants might be an interesting face to explore for this
    project.
