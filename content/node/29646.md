  used for orange's idents?  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.orange.com/images/common/orange.gif,
  also, http://www.orange.co.uk/\r\n\r\ni'd primarily like to know the typeface used
  in the logotype, but also what the other collateral faces that are used, like the
  light title text, for example....\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\nTom"

  body: "Tom, \r\nWelcome to Typophile posting. I wish you had picked something that
    was big enough to be identifiable. At the only size I can see on their site, it
    seems like we could pick almost any sans serif, and not know the difference. Does
    the 'a' have any tail? Is the 'e' crossbar angled? I really can't tell even these
    basic things at screen resolution.\r\n\r\nI was concentrating on Orange in the
    square, but the other type on the page you linked seemed like what I would call
    'generic sans' (Helvetica/Arial).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
