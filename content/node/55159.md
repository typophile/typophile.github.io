    that 'iTunes' is written in and all other headings on the mac site appears to
    be a different font (see pics below)... does anyone know what font this is or
    is it exclusive to Apple?\r\n\r\nA*\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iTunes_5506.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mac-font_5196.png]"
