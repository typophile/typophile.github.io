body: "This is a monogram I have been working on for a school. My problem is with
  the width relationships between the stem, the leg and the arm of the K. I think
  I'm almost close to nailing it but it's such a difficult letter.\r\n\r\nI also tried
  to compensate for the brightness of the F making it slightly narrower on the stem
  than the J and the K.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Monogram_4089.png]"

    school with my initials a long time ago. It's a good technique. \r\n\r\nIt's working
    pretty well but the top of the F looks a little clunky to me.  I like the minimalism
    but have you tried keeping more of the K?\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think you could try to either lower the right curve of |J| or gently reprise
    that curve on the F/K edge.

  body: My first thought was to make the J taller so you can see the F more clearly.
    Same as what riccard0 is suggesting.

  body: Thanks, I'll try pushing the length of the J although I can't show more of
    the stem of the K because the previous version of the monogram shows a cropped
    K stem and looks pretty bad.

  body: "It's working great! I read \"J K\" at first but an instant later read the
    \"F\".\r\n\r\nI would make the stem/gap of the \"F\" slightly narrower. Have you
    tried making the terminal of the \"J\" more harmonious with the angles in the
    \"K\"? That might backfire though...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I have to make some prints of the monogram at different sizes to decide the
    optima width of the stem-gap of the F, I'm not quite convinced of it yet!
