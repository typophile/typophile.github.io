  find the name of this font:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fettybe.com/storage/graphics/Strictly%20Rhythm.jpg]]\r\n\r\nAnd
  then a free download to re-create it for a project. \r\n\r\nIf anyone can help,
  it's very much appreciated!\r\n\r\n"

    font, either you'll want the exact one OR you'll want a free one which could be
    similar.\r\n\r\nIn the latter case, you could try this:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=levicrayola&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=STRICTLY+RHYTM&nb_ppp=10&af=on&psize=l&classt=alpha"

    too.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/R-191827-1101447605_5355.jpg]\r\n\r\nDefinitely
    not a digital font. The original looks like it was drawn with a marker pen. You
    might find something close in the grafitti categories of free font sites like
    the one linked to."
