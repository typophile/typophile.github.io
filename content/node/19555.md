  section, you can find examples of old-fashioned greek lettering as it appears in
  various shop displays in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. Most of the presented
  specimens, have been designed (probably) 40 to 50 years ago. A great source of inspiration
  for script or display greek fonts.\r\n\r\nThere is an ongoing effort to collect
  as many specimens as possible. The list of photos will be updated whenever it's
  possible."
