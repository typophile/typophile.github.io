  Uppercase-Condensed Classic? 2000s trend font..."> <BR> <BR>Hi y&#39;all...I feel
  a bit chagrinned at not knowing this one, it&#39;s been everywhere last few years.  I
  think this font &#40;or one like it&#41; goes back to the 40s or even earlier. What
  I note about it is the distinctive vertical &#39;O&#39; &#40;it has no curve on
  the sides of the bowl&#41; and the leg of the &#39;R&#39; is straight, no inflections.
  I always see this font in it&#39;s UC version it seems, and it is often altered
  to look degenrated as if from an old press where all the ink doesn&#39;t get transferred...anyway,
  probably a no brainer for all you typophiles out there. Thx in advance,

  body: Thx so much, Yves. I must have had a blow to the head &#39;cause I use TG
    frequently and ruled it out completely for some reason despite it being a standard
    fav of mine. It is close but I think you&#39;ve nailed it with DIN; weight&#39;s
    closer. Well, good to have that sorted...I can get a bit obsessive with such things...By
    the way, nice job ID-ing not just the font but the source mag as well!
