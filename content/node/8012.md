    typefaces &#40;including Futura&#41;. In &#34;Die Neue Typographie&#34; he used
    Akzidenz Grotesk and something that looks similar to &#40;but isn&#39;t&#41; Venus.

  body: ' Tschichold &#40;who in those days called himself Ivan&#41; used whatever
    the typesetters had. There was some Akzidenz Grotesk around, and there were a
    few precursors to Futura &#40;which only came out in 1927, two years after Tschichold&#39;s
    manifest&#41;, namely Kristall Grotesk, but also Erbar. If I was at my desk in
    Berlin, I could pull out the specimen books and be more exact. <BR> <BR>At the
    Bauhaus, the composing room had a lot of Schelter Grotesk, which -- btw -- was
    the actual model for Helvetica &#40;or Neue Haas Grotesk, as it was originally
    called&#41;. It looks like a clunky version of Akzidenz, with an anglosaxon style
    &#34;doubledecker&#34; l/c g. Tschichold used that as well, since Schelter &amp;
    Giesecke was a foundry from Leipzig, where T. worked and lived. And local printers
    bought local fonts, wherever they could. Fonts were a bitch to ship in those days...
    <BR> <BR>Christian Schwartz has just about finished designing a new face based
    on Schelter Grotesk, using some of the specimens from my library. He is calling
    it FF Bau &#40;the name &#34;Haus&#34; was gone&#41; and it&#39;ll be published
    by the FontFont library. Look out for it - Tschichold would approve. '
