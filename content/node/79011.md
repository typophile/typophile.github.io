  of this page (the headline for this topic, which should say, \"Typophile headline
  slab serif?\"), and it confused WhattheFont. It looks like a cross between St. Marie
  and with some elements of Skopex.\r\n\r\nI also tried viewing the source code to
  see if I could find it in the CSS. Used FIrebug to inspect the element.\r\n\r\nSo
  I give up. What font is Typophile using for this headline at the top of the page?"

    The Font Bureau\" on the side of this page. \r\n\r\nSOLVED!\r\n\r\nThanks for
    looking, if you did!"
