  of an MM-axis? It\xB4s consisting of two kerned fonts in the ends, light and black.
  It seems a bit arbitrary to me what the outcome will be. Sometimes the kern value
  will be like in the black version, sometimes the kerning just disappears..."

  body: "It depends on which version of \"FL\" you are talking about. In FontLab Studio
    5.0.2 (and I believe, any 5.0.x version), the kerning will be interpolated. In
    older versions, there were some problems with kerning interpolation for MM. \r\n\r\nA."
