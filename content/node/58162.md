  body: "Which characteristics of Candara are you looking for specifically?\r\n\r\nIf
    you are looking for a lapidary-type feel, what about going all the way with <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/cartercone/skia-cc/\">Skia</a>, or maybe <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/lithos/\">Lithos</a> if you don't mind
    the lack of a lowercase?"

  body: Why not Candara? It's in interesting design, and with its Cyrillic/Greek well
    equipped. (And afaik by far not overused yet.)
