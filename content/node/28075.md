body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nI'm designing a book for a literary club.  Actually,
  it might be more accurate to call it a journal, a collection of short fiction.  This
  is not a high-tech affair - I'm going to use InDesign (with which I have a little
  experience, but I'm very much an amateur), but it's going to be bound and printed
  at a local printing shop, which means it will probably be laser printed.  Still,
  we want it to look as professional as possible, and at least to follow sound design
  principles, even if it's not fancy.\r\n\r\nIt will be on letter-sized paper, in
  two columns, double sided, and due to size constraints, print will not be very large
  - not newspaper sized, but compact.\r\n\r\nThe stories in this collection are all
  of the same genre and involve similar sorts of characters; they'll all be cop/detective
  crime-fighting stories, set in gritty London in the 1970s, but with a smattering
  - or more - of romance, and aimed mostly at an adult female audience.\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for a serif font that is suitable for continuous text, extremely readable/legible
  even in modest sizes (say, 10-pointish, though the actual size will depend of course
  on the typeface), that works well with laser printing, and that complements the
  subject matter.  I'll need italics for emphasis, but other than that this will be
  typical fiction, with mostly plain old roman text.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?  I'm
  not a typographer - I'm really new to all this (though I'm seeing how easy it would
  be to get hooked!). I've read thoroughly through the forums here and made myself
  a list of seemingly can't-go-wrongs, like Sabon and Stempel Garamond and Bembo Book
  and maybe Dante.  Deciding among those seems hard enough, but then I get diverted
  by potentially more interesting possibilities like Dolly or Warnock, and then I
  end up even more confused.  I'm further hamstrung by the fact that I've never seen
  many of these other than as examples online.  \r\n\r\nSo now I'm overwhelmed and
  looking for guidance from people with experience!\r\n\r\nI very much appreciate
  any help or suggestions you can offer."

  body: "Warnock seems reasonable. It is fairly contemporary and has an x-height tall
    enough to be seen at 10-point. It has a really humanist, stroke quality to it,
    too.\r\n\r\nHowever, I never seen Warnock set in a long text, so staying with
    1970's classics like, lo and behold, ITC Garamond, might be the way to go :)"

    body: 'There''s a secret here of real use to you. Some Adobe Open Type releases,
      like Warnock, offer optical weights, so that instead of Warnock Pro regular,
      you can choose Warnock Subhead, which is a shade cleaner and thus will come
      out of laser printing as clean, or cleaner, than the regular optical weight.
      Minion Pro, Adobe Jenson, Chaparral--same option. If you find yourself setting
      9 pt for long stretches, try ITC Stone Serif, it''s a superbly readable workhorse
      I''ve used for many such jobs. '

      body: "I hope this isn't a dumb question but... which Caslon?  There appear
        to be a number of Caslons - Adobe, Classico, #3, 540.  Is there one in particular
        you have in mind?\r\n\r\nAnd why Caslon over, say, Warnock?  This is an honest
        question - it's difficult for me to understand how those of you who have experience
        make these sorts of decisions, and some of the terms that get thrown around
        sound are like wine terms - \"lively,\" \"warm\" - I'm trying hard to associate
        them with what I'm seeing!"

    I think someone suggested it in another thread a while back for a gritty crime/pulp

  body: "Jessica,\r\n\r\nre: your last question: It's a matter of flavor, of tone.
    Caslon is very sensible, reliable, some would say boring and old-fashioned. Warnock
    is more electric, crisp, modern. Another face like Paperback is more tough, hard-boiled,
    flat-footed. Others have more flavor, or different flavors, and this aspect of
    typography is what interests book typographers. It's not really different from
    display typography, but the flavors have to be subtle. I have read books set in
    Trump Mediaeval and it's a nice dark color, but the shapes are so peculiar and
    exotic that it's a little distracting. \r\n\r\nYour material is gritty 70's cop
    crime romances for women (to oversimplify). What is the appropriate tone to overlay
    on the text, via type choice? Some might say Century Schoolbook is appropriate
    here, or newspaper types. But your choice can also influence the tone. For example,
    if you chose Fournier, it is still readable and serviceable, but more delicate,
    old-fashioned, and might draw out the romantic element of the stories. The type's
    own tone or flavor could be a contrast or counterpoint to the tone of the writing.\r\n\r\nThis
    might all sound like a nonsensical wine-snob discussion. It's like that; if you're
    into the details to the degree that you're using descriptors like warm, lively,
    quaint, aggressive, serious, then you're perceiving the qualities typefaces add
    to the text they're representing. If it doesn't matter, or if these influences
    are undesireable, use types that disappear: Times, Caslon, Baskerville, Janson,
    Caledonia, Sabon.\r\n\r\nI think it's nice that you're curious about this. "

  body: "My suggestion: print out some type specimen (in high dpi, please) and see
    it for yourself. \r\n\r\nTwo things to watch, among the many, are:\r\n<li>The
    overall color (read: blackness) and texture of the paragraph. \r\n<li>The 'butteriness'
    of the typeface, or how easy it is to read through the paragraph. Remember that
    fast reading aren't always appropriate, because text matter that is to be scrutinized
    by the reader (like a serious essay or technical material, for instance) will
    require a face that follow suit. Furthermore, there's that \"We read best what
    we read most\" adage, so this observation can be subjective.\r\n"

  body: "crossgrove, thank you - and that all makes sense; there are simply so many
    choices that I have no idea how to go about narrowing it down!  \r\n\r\nI think
    I want to be subtle, for the most part.  I want the typeface to complement the
    subject matter and tone, and not to look like it was printed out on Microsoft
    Word in Times New Roman or whatever Garamond comes with Word, and yet I don't
    really want it to draw attention to itself.  I'd prefer it not to be overtly romantic.
    \r\n\r\nThis is good, because it's forcing me to think about what I really want
    ... and I think if I had to pick a single descriptor it'd have to be that I'd
    mostly like it to have a \"British\" feel - or more specifically, a London-in-the-70s
    feel! ;-)- rather than a hard-boiled cop-detective feel or a romantic feel.  And
    ... this is entertainment; not meant to be serious technical reading.  I want
    it to be serviceable and very, very readable - *almost* invisible to the reader
    - but really attractive and clean.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this suggests Caslon - though
    part of me is still drawn to Dolly and/or Warnock!  And I just don't know enough
    to know if using those would be a mistake, or if Caslon would be boring and ugly,
    or if Century Schoolbook would be just too common - or maybe no one would notice
    at all and I'm driving myself crazy for nothing.\r\n\r\nWhew, this could be a
    challenging hobby!  Fun, though; I've just sent away for a bunch of books from
    Amazon, because I'm liking this ...\r\n\r\nIt does seem like printing out samples
    would be a good idea, but brampitoyo ... *how* exactly do I print out a type specimen
    for fonts without buying them?  I can't figure that out, though I know surely
    there must be a way!"
