  the threads here about the Bombsites \"Texter\", but are there any moore of these
  tools out there? \r\n\r\nOr are maybe all custom built for each specific Foundry
  that has one?\r\n\r\nAny info on this is most certainly welcome :)\r\n\r\nThanks

    Flash and ActionScript

  body: "The bad part thing about regular Flash testers is that it is very easy to
    convert the .swf to a .fla \u2013 and then you got a copy of all embedded letters.
    They are a little bit worse in the bezier curves of course, but still \u2013 it
    is rather easy to \"steal\" them, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nI would feel much better
    if the font was shown on the webpage using some other technique, like Thomas is
    mentioning. Some technique that produces gif\u2019s or jpg\u2019s instead.\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone know anything more about this, please drop a few lines :)"

  body: "goran, believe me, its easier for most people to get \"40'000 professional
    fonts\" including linotype gold and adobe fontfolio with some filesharing-application
    in an hour than rip (corrupted) vector data from an swf.. and everybody that will
    do that will never pay for your fonts anyway.\r\n\r\nif you want gifs though,
    there's a way via php. but as far as i know, kerning isnt possible with that."

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/lettersetter/index.html\">LetterSetter</a>\r\n\r\nAs
    for the PHP solution, AFAIK it's limited to TrueType fonts. Here's the function
    you'd have to use: <a href=\"http://www.php.net/imagettftext\">imagettftext</a>"

  body: "I\u2019ve stumbled upon the FreeType project, and by reading a little about,
    it seems like one could do a typesetter based on it somehow. Freetype 2 functions
    with both Opentype, postrcript and truetype as I read.\r\n\r\nThe hard part is
    of course to make it work together with PHP or CGI, and that is something that
    I wont even try to learn ;)\r\n\r\nThough this one is rather ugly, it works with
    FreeType v.1 \u2013 so i guess it could be built on FreeType 2 aswell? It\u2019s
    exactly what I\u2019m looking for, but need to get some help builiding it :)\r\n\r\nhttp://mbox.troja.mff.cuni.cz/~peak/ftdemo/index.cgi\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Well this is just a test type Tester to organize the code, but the XML will
    control the weight buttons and what font to load so I could use the same movie
    for different fonts. The XML will determine how many weights there are, and load
    the correct weight relating to that button. The XML could also be used to load
    predefined content, so you could have character set or phases like "The quick
    brown fox jumps over the lazy dog "  '

  body: "Dear Thomas,\r\n\r\nIf your Online Typesetter uses your core type rasterizer,
    why does it not handle GSUB features such as ligatures and contextual alternates?
    Seeing all of Robert's wonderful work on GARAMOND PREMIER PRO without ligatures
    is a tragedy. You have the best engine in the business. Use it! Using CoolType
    in the way that you are is, as my father would say, \"like buying an Aston Martin
    and never driving it!\"\r\n\r\nSorry I missed your assorted lectures in Lisbon.
    Deadlines called!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRandolph T. Burke"
