body: "I am seeking a geometric typeface that has Cassandre characteristics. It can
  be heavy, it can be bold - but it needs to have that certain delicacy of M and N
  foot that points at the baseline.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? I thought I liked Penumbra till
  I saw her legs sliding out to the side in an unladylike manner.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  input!"
