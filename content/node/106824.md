    two /i characters.

  body: "Good observation by George. Can't state if it's hand-drawn or not though.
    It is true /i dots position is different but your sample is also in bad condition.
    Just a thought now. I don't understand what would be the goal behind hand-drawing
    it from side, making repeating /i identical and finally, adding a \"hand-drawn\"
    touch by moving only 1 /i dot... Doesn't make sense to me... Anyway, here are
    some alternatives, close to your sample: [[http://www.jawarts.com/CornerStore.html|Corner

    body: "Thanks Ryuk!\r\n\r\nThis is a returning customer from 2009.  I just started
      this new job at a printshop last month, so I don't really know the project history.
      \ The customer doesn't even remember where he got the logo from.  This was the
      best and only hard copy sample I found in the archives.  Its a scan of his extremely
      small logo.\r\n\r\nThanks for the font suggestions and reply.  I will take a
      look at the recommended fonts!\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"
