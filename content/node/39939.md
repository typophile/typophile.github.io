  body: The one on the mug is an old typeface called Rustic. It's been modified a
    bit. The original is pruned (no branches sprouting out the sides) and has a dropshadow,
    otherwise it appears identical. I don't know of a digital version, but Pinewood
    looks roughly similar.

  body: "I know of two digital approximations of Rustic. One is called Birch. While
    rather nice in its own right, it's much lighter than Rustic was - and hard to
    find given that there's a popular commercial font called Birch as well.\r\n\r\nThe
    much better version (more faithful to Rustic, that is) is called <a href=\"http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/11942\"
    target=\"_blank\">Twig</a>."
