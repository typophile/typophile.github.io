  working on a title design and some rolling credits for a short movie.\r\n\r\nThe
  font I'm using is NITTI TYPEWRITER in size 35px. But I heard some concerns that
  the font still might be too small when shown on a cinema screen. The film will be
  shown on the big movie screen as well as on television.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know,
  what the minimum font size for screening text in a movie theater should be?\r\n\r\nIs
  there a common rule of thumb how a font size \"changes\" between a TV screen or
  a big screen?\r\n\r\n"

    to me that if it's big enough to be readable on a typical tv, it'll certainly
    be readable on a big movie screen."

    strobing :)

  body: Most credits are WAY too small once they hit the home screen. Unless there
    is a compelling reason to use small type (like, a gazillion credit lines that
    have to be shown in a very short time), bigger is always better...at least, for
    old fogies like me...

    don't know. But After Effects uses px instead of pt for measurement.\r\n\r\n@sii:
    is 35ppi the common amount for recent television sets? or how did you come up
    with that number?"

  body: "It should be possible to do \"angle of vision\" comparisons between (hand-held)
    print, home-viewed TV (both \"standard\" and HD), and cinema theatre. In each
    case one would calculate based on screen/page size, viewing distance, and definition.\r\n\r\nFrom
    my own experience with HDTV, looking at the micetype disclaimer text in ads, It
    looks like you can now get as many lines of sharp and readable type on a TV screen
    as you can a magazine page."

  body: "Hi Robert, \r\n\r\nI'm curious 18pt on 35mm film is pretty big, far bigger
    than movie credits we usually see. 18pt on a big screen 70ft across seems too
    small to read from the back of the theatre? So I'm assuming design size for these
    credits would be smaller? Can you explain the design process you used, eg 18pt
    on letter size paper. "

  body: "Coming from a broadcast view, it's 18 pt (px) <em>minimum</em> for standard-definition,
    double (36) for high-def as it is twice the resolution at the same screen-size
    - which it why it's high-def.... 18 is legible in HD, but best to avoid in case
    of down-sampling to SD (becomes 9pt, much too small). You might want to take all
    of this into consideration with your for-film designs.\r\n\r\nHere's a similar
