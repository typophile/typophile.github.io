  for my initials to sign my paintings (obviously created with a brush).\r\n\r\nDo
  you have any favorite/unique J's or G's that might be a great jumping off point
  for a script (or perhaps non-script) signature? I've been rather un-inspired by
  the combinations I've been able to dream up.\r\n\r\nAlso- are there any painters
  past or present that have signed their work in a way that stood out to you as letterers?\r\n\r\nEager
  to hear any thoughts or suggestions. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Matthew Carter cites Mantegna as a painter with great lettering.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Norman Rockwell had a variety of immaculately lettered "signatures," including
    widely spaced capitals, a kind of "stenciled" hand, cursive "schoolbook" writing,
    and others. The type and lettering in his paintings is usually very well done.
