  body: "akmal cheema, I am sorry but I do not understand what \"transliteration\"
    means in this context. Are we looking for a font that has all the necessary English
    (Latin) characters and Arabic characters? Or is it a font that has phonetic symbols
    for Arabic pronunciation? Or something else? Can someone explain this to me?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    it might be helpful to offer a little bit of information about the subject of
    the book, so that readers can suggest an appropriate font."
