body: "I'm looking for a source of high quality images to use in teaching presentations
  that represent key touchstones along the timeline of history specifically relating
  to the development of letterforms and the evolution of typography. An example might
  include a good image of the Rosetta Stone or a sample of cuneiform or possibly a
  high res image from the Book of Kells. These would only be used for teaching purposes
  and not reprinted. Any help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\nLance
