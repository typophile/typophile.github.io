  contemporary bible editions. <BR>Of course I also want to take into account what
  has been achieved in bible printing in history and try to compare where there are

  <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t see what&#39;s written in it, because I cannot get the book
  here. <BR>Maybe I should consider buying it - and therefore I need someones help:
  <BR> <BR>Does anybody know this book or the entire series?  <BR>Or the authors?
  <BR> <BR>And: Maybe someone has good advice for additional literature? <BR> <BR>thank
  you for any help <BR> <BR>Michael'

    famous work, &#34;Space between Words&#34; is quite insightful. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    your topic sounds killer. Bible type falls squarely into my own lo-fi obsessions.
    So when you finish the paper, could I please ask you to share it with me/us? <BR>
    <BR>Also: Van&#42; Krimper made a bible font &#40;a quite extreme one, called
    Sheldon&#41;, which can be seen in Tracy&#39;s &#34;Letters of Credit&#34;, as
    well as &#34;The aesthetic world of Jan van Krimpen - book designer and typographer&#34;&#42;&#42;
    &#40;and I&#39;m sure elsewhere too&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; Note that -apparently-
    Dutch wants that capitalized when the proper name is omitted. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;

    Sheldon is not listed in identifont.com nor in myfont.com. <BR> <BR>The editions

    &#40;to speak with Bringhursts words&#41; or how it stands between content and
    the reader &#40;I fear this is the case in most of the cheap bibles with mostly
    bad typography that should supposedly ease reading but actually don&#39;t&#41;.

  body: Of course the german bible society uses the original &#34;Biblica&#34; &#40;owned
    by them&#41; instead of the later released ITC Weidemann.  <BR>So I should have
    written Biblica/Weidemann. <BR>There are minor differences. I will show them later.
    <BR> <BR>Rotis was used as Rotis Serif. <BR>I once also saw a very cheap edition
    set in Rotis SemiSerif &#40;!&#41;. <BR>But I was a little upset about that &#40;there
    is an own story about Rotis and its use in Bavaria where I live - and a huge typographical
    discussion, also happened here I think&#41;, and didn&#39;t want to buy it at
    once.  <BR>Later I couldn&#39;t find it anymore. It was in a shop for 1-Euro-Books-Rests.
    Now I only feel sad for the people who will propably tire their eyes with it.
    I remember the typography was awful too.  <BR> <BR>But of course I hope the holy
    spirit can use poor quality too and will put vivid sound to the words one can
    read even in Rotis SemiSerif ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Michael

  body: Yes, it was originally called Biblica. <BR> <BR>Rudolf Koch&#39;s Jessen&#42;
    was also specifically designed for Bibles,&#42;&#42; I believe. Not that this
    is the most legible face in any size. It is beautiful though. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;
    Properly called Peter Jessen Schrift, I believe. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; I have heard
    that Wallau was also intended as a Bible face, but I can&#39;t verify that. I
    have seen a few Bible pages depicted in books that were set with it, though.

    <BR> <BR>It always is a temptation for me to take broken scripts in account too.
    But then my research would get longer and longer on the one hand.  <BR>On the

    later in my schedule. <BR>Of course function/economy is of the biggest interest.
    <BR>The portability issue already practically rose up &#40;I had it in mind before&#41;,
    when I presented the first results to my teacher of typography: The box with all
    that bibles was hardly portable. <BR> <BR>I first restricted my paper to bibles
    that can be held in one hand for reading. But because I wanted to include some
    editions using interesting fonts - those were design-aware projects and including
    pictures - so now I have four editions that have to be held with two hands or
    lying on the table. <BR> <BR>John: <BR>Thats a good note for me.  <BR>Do you think
    it&#39;s worth buying the whole series &#40;$220 plus shipping to germany&#41;?  <BR>As
    a theologian/typophile I&#39;m interested in the typographical tradition of the
    bible from two aspects of view. And I think one can learn typographically a lot
    from the development of the hebrew/greek editions.  <BR>From the information from
    the website of Oak Knoll I couldn&#39;t quite figure out if the edition will suite
    well to my needs. <BR>In my theologian study I already learned a lot of the tradition
    of manuscripts in the theologian/historian view &#40;and I have books on that
    too&#41;. But now my interest goes to the typographical details and development
    of that tradition. <BR>It seems that the series covers exactly that point, but
    I&#39;m not quite sure. <BR> <BR>And of course it&#39;s an amount of money I have
    to think well about. <BR> <BR>The book of De Hamel had already run on my desk
    &#40;yesterday, in the german edition&#41;. It&#39;s a very fine book, and looking
    on all the beautiful illustrated pages/specimens Umberto Eco&#39;s &#34;Name of
    the Rose&#34; comes to my mind. But I hadn&#39;t enough time yet to read the text
    of De Hamel. <BR> <BR>Michael'

    of fraktur/blackletter doesn&#39;t help, if people can&#39;t read it anymore -
    or if they have the false connotation with the script.  <BR>I suppose it would
    bring another, much more distant &#34;sound&#34; to the words. That could perhaps
    even help - like a &#34;defamiliarization&#34;-effect we know from theatre or
    literature. But in most cases this doesn&#39;t work for the broad audience. <BR>
    <BR>But improvements and worsening can also be shown in comparing the &#34;old&#34;
    typographically learned and sophisticated editions of former hotmetal printers
    compared to modern computerists. <BR>Dealing with the economic screw is so easy
    in computersetting: You reduce tracking, linespacing, take a condensed font -
    and voila: the bible doesn&#39;t seem as a huge book anymore! &#40;But you can&#39;t
    read it anymore if you want to read more than three words a minute&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Fortunately we have a reference edition set by Max Caflisch with care in the
    60s. And he wrote detailed about it. <BR>There is plenty of comparison between

    with a severe, earnest, grave mood, <BR>of reading in the flow of the words and
