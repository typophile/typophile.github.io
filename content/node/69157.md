  how I said \"unicase\" in Spanish and Italian, but nobody knew. I searched for this
  word in every dictionaries, but I didn't find almost in any dictionaries or in any
  translations. You already know what unicase is. It's a speciman of typeface, like
  Alphabet 26 and Filosofia Unicase.\r\n\r\n1) How do I say \"unicase\" in Spanish
  and Italian?\r\n2) How do I define \"unicase\"?\r\n\r\nThanx!\r\n\r\nKevin from

  body: "I do not know of a direct equivalent in Spanish for the word unicase, perhaps
    'una caja', 'caja \xFAnica', both of which are direct translations ... dare I
    say 'unicaja'?\r\n\r\nIn referring to a unicase font, I prefer to describe it
    as 'solo altas' or 'solo bajas' to explain the fact that we would be dealing with
    an only upper case or only lower case typeface. For example, to describe Herbert
    Bayer's 1925 experimental universal alphabet, I would resort to 'solo bajas'.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Actually, I think \"unicase\" (opposed to, I believe, \"monocase\") refers
    to typefaces in which some letters maintains a lowercase form while others have
    an uppercase form. \r\nOften it is a mean to eliminate ascenders and descenders.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the translation, I'm not sure a proper term in Italian exists, because there
    isn't the very concept of \"case\". A letter is either \"maiuscola\" (uppercase)
    or \"minuscola\" (lowercase).\r\nBut I should check some books to be sure."

  body: "I thought the definition of Alphabet 26 by Bradbury Thompson's article at
    Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n<strong>Thompson developed Alphabet 26 or a \"monoalphabet\"
    - an alphabet consisted of just one case (instead of using separate uppercase
    and lowercase letterforms as typefaces typically do). His monoalphabet was NOT
    a modern serif (not comparable to Bodoni) with lowercase a, e, m and n mixed with
    uppercase B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, R, T, U and Y. (The forms of C/c, O/o,
    S/s, V/v, W/w, X/x and Z/z are essentially the same in uppercase and lowercase
    in the first place.\r\n\r\nAlphabet 26 does not eliminate uppercase; however,
    uppercase letters are simply larger versions of their lowercase counterparts.
    This was intended to regularize the letters of the alphabet, making them more
    logical and intuitive, and also making learning the alphabet easier for children.
    Thompson first published the alphabet in a Westvaco Inspirations for Printers.</strong>\r\n\r\nIs
    this definition OK?"

  body: The reason English speakers prefer the coinage "unicase" for a blending of
    majuscule and minuscule shapes into one case, while "monocase" implies a typeface
    that has only majuscules or only minuscules, is the strong association with the
    words "unite" and "unify". So perhaps "letras unidas" would be preferable to "letras
    unicas".

    rather than with the unique characteristics of Castillian speech. So it would

    the cause of the problem is apparent:\r\n\r\nIn English, we ordinarily refer to
    \"capital letters\" and \"small letters\", but since \"small letters\" seems...
    inadequate, ambiguous, or excessively informal... the technical terms \"upper
    case\" and \"lower case\" have been borrowed from printing for general use. In
    French, as in Spanish, the terms \"majuscules\" and \"minuscules\", on the other
    hand, are entirely satisfactory, and thus terms equivalent to \"upper case\" and
