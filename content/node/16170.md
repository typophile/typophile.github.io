  body: Tim7 every year there is someone who asks the exact same question. That is
    why I think it should be in the FAQ. Last year it was from a game developer. The
    comment wasn't directed at you it was more a general obversation.

  body: "<em>> Dan Weaver, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t follow you, am I not allowed
    to ask for the font of soccer teams?</em>\r\n\r\nI think this might be a slight
    misunderstanding. There are two sports-related questions popping up constantly
    on the Type ID Board, which can get a bit tedious to some people after a while.\r\n\r\nThe
    first category relates to logos of American sports clubs, more specifically baseball,
    basketball and such. As those clubs usually make a lot of money with merchandising
    featuring their logo, they have every reason to make that logo as difficult to
    copy as possible. So very often these logos are either custom designed, and even
    if they are based on existing typefaces they're highly customised.\r\n\r\nThe
    second category are gamers who want to customise their soccer games by adapting
    the jerseys into the \"colours\" of specific soccer teams. Here we have a fifty
    fifty situation -- sometimes the teams use existing typefaces on their jerseys,
    sometimes those are custom designed faces as well. Often it's the sport apparel
    brands who sponsor those teams that use proprietary faces on the jerseys (Adidas
    and Nike come to mind).\r\n\r\nThat being said -- yes, <em>anyone</em> is allowed
    to ask for sports-related IDs anytime on this board, Tim. Whenever you come across
    any typeface you want identified, post it here. On the other hand, any IDer is
    free to ignore an ID request if he/she experiences it as frivolous or excessive
    or anything else, Dan. If you don't feel like IDing a font, nobody's forcing you.\r\n\r\nAnd
    last but not least, anyone is allowed to make comments about the appropriateness
    of any type identification request, as long as we all stay courteous and tolerant.
    So Tim, if you want post soccer jersey related ID requests, please do so. I can
    assure you that we will <em>always</em> try our the best to help you, but understand
    that there always will be a possibility that at some point someone could say:\"Oh
    gawd, not another soccer jersey!?\" ;^)"
