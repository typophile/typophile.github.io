  there&#39;s this fancy book, selling for US$1700, made before the phototype/digital
  &#34;dark ages&#34;, and the most prominent thing about it is how &#42;horridly&#42;
  they spaced the title. On top of it, what font did they use &#40;using the term
  very loosely indeed&#41; to commit this barbarism? Only Perpetua, which has the
  best Roman caps ever made in history. <BR> <BR>Where&#39;s my fauchard, man. <BR>

    understand that metal type couldn&#39;t have negative kerning &#40;usually&#41;,
    so the &#34;RO&#34; can be explained. But that doesn&#39;t explain why the whole
    thing wasn&#39;t just spaced looser, and it doesn&#39;t explain the rediculous
    and uneven spacing around the &#34;Y&#34;. <BR> <BR>From what I understand, Gill
    left the spacing of his fonts to the Monotype boys, and they were usually good
    at it. Maybe Pierpont was on vacation? In any case, the &#42;user&#42; of a font
    -especially in the setting of a title- is equally responsible for the outcome,
    especially in metal. And especially in the case of Latin all-caps. <BR> <BR>More:
    In the pre-digital days it wasn&#39;t really possible to implement very good spacing,
    but we now have no excuse to keep the spacing of Latin all-caps in the Bronze
    Age. <BR> <BR>Fonts should have positive kerning between all UC-UC pairs. <BR>
