  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;d love to add [[timelines]] to the [[typowiki|wiki]], but don&rsquo;t want them to be incomplete or incorrect. I also realize that something like an history about something like posteres can be subjective as you first must answer the question, &ldquo;What is a Poster?&rdquo; But, I thought this would make a fun exercise. A test if you will.</p>
<p>This timeline was created in 2000 for an essay I was writing about that very question mentioned previously. Let&rsquo;s see how this goes.</p>
<hr>
<p>The History of the Printed Poster up to 1900.</p>
<p>Before [[Gutenberg]]</p>
<p>10,000 B.C. &ndash; The Birth of Visual Communication can be traced to the cave paintings done during the Paleolithic age in Lascaux, France
105 A.D. &ndash; Paper was discovered in China by Ts’ai Lun 
79 A.D. &ndash; The “advertisements” over the baths at Pompeii.</p>
<p>15th Century</p>
<p>1439 &ndash; Johannes Gutenberg’s creates the hand-operated press in Mainz, Germany.
1461	 &ndash; Mainz, Germany. Leaflets and Posters were printed for both sides during a feud between bishops. Supposedly the beginning of political posters and leaflets.
1470 &ndash; First Publisher’s catalogue printed as a poster by Peter Schöffer in Mainz.
1477 &ndash; First advertisement printed by William Caxton. It announces an edition of Pyes of Salisbury.
1482 &ndash; In Paris for Notre Dame in Rheims a message is posted promising that the faithful would all be forgiven their sins if they were to make an offering of money in church on the day of Pope Pius’s visit. This poster was a Gothic woodcut with the Madonna as the patron of the church, the papal insignia and the coat of arms of the town of Rheims–possibly the first specimen of a text supported by illustration.</p>
<p>16th Century</p>
<p>1505	 &ndash; Etching was invented in Ausburg.
1517	 &ndash; Martin Luther posts his ninety-five theses for debate on the door of Castle Church in Wittenberg. Subsequently, his friends passed on copies to the printers to be reproduced, by December the whole of the continent knew of Luther’s beliefs.
1518 &ndash; The first wood engraving poster was printed in Rostock
1518 &ndash; The archibishop of Mainz set up the first board of censors to supervise printing.
1520	 &ndash; The first playbill from a wood engraving also printed in Rostock
1539 &ndash; 	Frances I of France found it necessary to issue an order on putting up posters.</p>
<p>17th Century</p>
<p>1653 &ndash; A decree is sent out by the goverment in Paris forbidding, on pain of death, the printing and exhibition, or bill-posting, of posters without an official permit</p>
<p>18th Century</p>
<p>1722	 &ndash; In Paris the goverment tries yet again to control the posters.
1742 &ndash; A new edict is issued which requires two copies of every bill or poster to be delivered up to the Royal Library.
1760 &ndash; The Industrial Revolution begins in England.
1780 &ndash; James Watt introduces the ability of steam power.
1798	 &ndash; Lithography is discovered by Alois Senefelder.</p>
<p>19th Century</p>
<p>1810	 &ndash; Frederick Koenig invents the powered printing machine thus enabling the truest form of mass production for man yet.
1838 &ndash; Charles Dickens uses the word ‘poster’ in his book <em>Nicholas Nickleby</em>. Shortly thereafter it is accepted in the the English dictionary.
1845 &ndash; Paul Gavarni produces the black and white lithographic poster Les Français. Together with Honoré Daumier, they attempt to produce posters with artistic merit.
1850	 &ndash; The power-operated press has been advanced enough to produce up to 10,000 sheets per hour
1867 &ndash; Jules Chéret  produces the color lithographic poster for the play La Biche au Bois starring Sarah Bernhardt
1868	 &ndash; Edouard Manet’s black on white lithographic poster for the book Les Chats by Champfleury. 
1871	 &ndash; Fred Walker prints the first British pictorial poster for Wilkie Collins’ play and novel Woman in White. This is what is considered to be the first British poster with any artistic merit.
1895 &ndash; Alphons Mucha prints his first poster for Sardou’s play Gismonda.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">These are probably dumb questions, but was paper invented or discovered? Also for a poster you wouldn&rsquo;t need movable type, so is there any evidence for &lsquo;block-book&rsquo; style &lsquo;printed&rsquo; posters pre movable metal type?</div>

<p>Tim &ndash; Where can we find more information about that? Sounds like an honest addition.</p>

Petrucci uses the city of Rome as a case in point for the history of publically displayed script. The primary period discussed is late medievael through the mid-20th century, but with frequent reference to ancient practice. Chapter 7—Ephemeral Monumental and Paper Monumental—is particularly pertinent.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Finding information on the web isn&rsquo;t easy (and should be taken with a pinch of salt), I can find two urls that I can be fairly confident are accurate <a href="http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:qN7hfvOz3_MJ:www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1510/is_1987_Spring/ai_4806053+roman+advertising+BC&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=6&client=safari">here</a> and <a href="http://www.classicsunveiled.com/romel/html/amphiglad.html">here</a>. Your point about at what time does a grafitto become a poster is a tricky one, much of the advertising in Rome was hand drawn in chalk directly onto walls, slaves might be sent out to write up a message on various prominent walls, rubbing out rival messages, to draw attention to the message they included borders and sometimes an image, the advertisements were for political campaigns (including games, circuses and bread), products (olives, olive oil, garum etc), more personal services (to use a euphemism) and so on <em>plus ça change</em>; also wooden boards would be used for more permanence, however, for quality control, some campaigns were copied onto paper (papyrus, I imagine vellum or parchment would be prohibitively expensive) by a scriptorium and then posted. I suppose all of these would in some way be  posters, in that they serve the same purpose and have the longevity as a more modern poster, I suggest that the medium is less important than the message on the wall in the definition of poster, especially to the patron.

Meggs (Third Edition) shows Senefelder inventing lithography in 1796 instead of 1798. Anyone know which is the correct date? Perhaps the idea came to him in &lsquo;96 and he made it happen two years later? Sorry, I won&rsquo;t  claim to be a history buff, I should probably know this stuff!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Another thought about the history of posters. Both papermaking and printing were invented in China. Printing of decrees, laws, etc. permitted wide distribution across China’s vast administrative reaches, and with less possibility for scribal error.
Rubbings were the first form of printing on paper. Since c. 175 CE, important decrees, texts, scriptures, poems, and pictures were inscribed on wood, bronze, and stone. Then copies, made by rubbings and ink transfer, were distributed on paper.  Some of these transfers were certainly meant for posting in public.</div>

<p>Much of the woodblock prints were used for book illustration. How many people would have actually had access to these books? It seems like a waste if all of this great work was unknown to the public.</p>

<p>Five or six years ago I saw a Japanese film, a drama, about an artist who made such prints (Hokusai had a bit part). It was brilliant, one of the best films about art, but I can&rsquo;t remember the name. It was set towards the end of the Edo era, c. 1830s, I believe.</p>
<p>Anyway, it recreated the theatre district, and showed the print shops as stores which had their wares hung outside to attract passers-by.</p>

I am interested to know why you stopped at Mucha, although I would class his work as the acme of the 19th century. I would also be interested to know when the poster became a cheap artwork for the public, did it start with people stealing posters from the walls?

<p>But that fit into the tradition of fine art prints (often engravings of paintings) that were kept in &ldquo;portfolios&rdquo;, not books.</p>
<p>It would have been hard to steal posters if they were glued to walls.</p>
<p>Bogart&rsquo;s book is good on the poster-or-art issue c.1900.</p>
<p>BTW,</p>
<p>Calendars were a related art form.
Maxfield Parrish&rsquo;s paintings (1920s) were beautifully printed in special colors, distributed via calendars, but subsequently framed and mounted in homes. These same images had started life in adverts and posters (with product ID), but he kept the copyright.</p>

Good information thanks,
