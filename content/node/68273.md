  and I am trying to find a font that closest resembles a drawing I made. The closest
  I can find is Stainless from Font Bureau. I don't want it to be too stiff like ITC
  Blair. I want it to have slight bends similar to the icon. Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_1956_6339.JPG]"

    aren't exactly like your sketch, but they might have a slight bend like the one
    you describe.
