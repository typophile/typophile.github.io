  new one.  What do you think?  I think I'm going to change the color on the tagline...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greenfieldlogo.jpg]"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI actually prefer the old one (sorry) - but the new one is cool
    too (more corporate also). I would probably change the tagline colour as you said...
    might also want to try right-aligning it.\r\n\r\nNot sure if it is just the low
    res jpg but the circle doesn't seem complete on the right-hand side... think it
    might look better if it was.\r\n\r\nJust my opinion.\r\nCheers,\r\nKarl\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Some things for now. The way to join the two word it's a good idea. However,
    I'd not choose a condensed face for the word field. Also, why the red color for
    the \u201Cpunch line\u201D under the name. To me, I find it would be more acurate
    if you work with less color. The g and f in the black circle seems to be out of
    the new logo. Finally, the cut on the right of the circle should be clearer, because
    now it seems like it's a bad print job. "

  body: Your new look needs a lot of work. For instance why are the lowercase g's
    different from the gf symbol and the g in green. I don't see the reason for making
    field another typeface. It could easily read Greenfield not Green Field and have
    the same impact. The fi combination is terrible (spacing) and needs to be solved.
    Most of the letter spacing is bad and needs work. The tag line is lost in that
    face and making it fit in that space. What is your business? What does "Cultivating
    the web" mean? Don't assume anyone else will know, make it very clear.

  body: "I'm at work now so I can't make any touch-ups, but here are some comments:\r\nThe
    \"field\" isn't another typeface - it's just not bold, but it's the same typeface.
    \ I didn't mess with the letter spacing at all - so that still needs work.\r\n\r\nThe
    old logo is kind of nice, but I also wanted something I can shrink and place in
    the footers of the websites I create.  The top logo doesn't shrink too well.\r\nGreenField
    is supposed to be one word.  The name of my company is \"GreenField Designs\"
    - it's a web design company.\r\nI think I just may replace the tag line (it was
    just a thought I threw together) with bar to help fill the space.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the input.  If you have anymore comments before I can get back to the drawing
    board, let 'em rip."

  body: I'm going to make an assumption about your concept. It reminds me of old farm
    signage, agricultural equipment, with an industrial feel. Is this the direction?
    If so, I think it makes sense, but the logo definitely needs to be finessed -
    letterspacing, etc. I would even think about keeping "greenfield" in the same
    typeface, and separating the words by color. There's something about that combination
    of typefaces that isn't working for me. I think you're heading in a much better
    direction - that first logo looks like a logo for cookies, or health food.

    use the different weights like that.\r\n\r\nI also don't see much a point to the
    GF in a circle. Just stick with the type logo, IMHO."

  body: "I prefer the original as well, mainly because if feels more distinct and
    has a more solid design. But, I understand the desire to move away from it. However,
    I think your changes are a bit scattered. They are leaning towards one direction,
    but not working together and just confusing things.\r\n\r\nIf your concept is
    the idea of the web as a 'green field' and your design group 'cultivates' it,
    then this should sit more squarely at the center. I like the idea that Chris Keegan
    mentioned: the agricultural look. It's unique and has a lot of visual possibilities
    that make your concept a bit clearer.\r\n\r\nWhat you've design so far has the
    feeling of a concept sketch that's been executed on the computer. Research something
    like <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/darrylsphotoblog/89769945/\">painted barn
    signs</a> or something with a bit more life to it. Your current design feels too
    sterile to have real character, but too mixed to be modern and sleek. Your old
    design was complex, but it seems to get at the concept more directly. Also, if
    your company name is GreenField, I'd stick with that same treatment. It's confusing
    otherwise and the whole 'bold/regular but one word' thing is very played out.\r\n\r\nYour
    project definitely has possibilities. I'm eager to see where it goes."
