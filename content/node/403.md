  him a blank e-mail. In reality, I&#39;d never sent Tabur any e-mails and we wrote
  back and fourth to determine the source of this wierdness . . . <BR> <BR>A few days
  later, his friend Brode of Sacred Nipple had similar encounters. I also received
  another blank e-mail with an .exe file attached from Fontosaurus. <BR> <BR>A day
  later, I found out the same thing had been happening to Brian of Astigmatic. I had
  been the recipient of e-mails from infected computers, but never from computers
  infected with font designers e-mail addresses. <BR> <BR>Has this happened to anybody
  else? <BR> <BR>Stuart :D '

    your address in their address book... and they have a Windows-based PC. The virus
    infects their machine, steals some email addresses and forwards itself and a randomly

    may even be self-modifying in that it passes on email addresses through a couple
