  body: "I don't like the floating word, the last A leaning against the radiator is
    cool though. Have you tried doing the same with the other letters? They could
    possibly be of varying sizes, or some closer to the camera, lying on the floor
    etc.\r\n\r\nAlso there is a little black thing on the right skirting board that
    needs removed."
