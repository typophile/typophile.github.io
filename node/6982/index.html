		<div class="commentbody"><i>What are traps?</i> <BR> <BR>Inktraps. This term originally referred to those parts of a letter in which there was a tendency for ink to build up. Tight angles, such as the inside of the bottom of the letter v can be inktraps. The problem is exacerbated in some printing processes, by ink consistency, and also by the heaviness of coverage; it is particularly problematic in heavy types such as black sans serifs. Nowadays, the term is often used, as Tiffany and Hrant are using it, in reference to the technique used to correct letterforms to avoid this problem. This typically involves taking a nick out of the ink trap area to compensate for the build up of ink, or otherwise lightening that part of the letter, e.g. by tapering stems as in the v shown above. <BR> <BR>Adobe Sans is a Multiple Master font that includes a weight axis from very light to extremely black. The inktrap correction becomes much more obvious as the weight increases.</div>

Tiffany shoots her mouth off again and then John swoops in like Superman and cleans up the mess will an articulate and erudite answer. <BR> <BR>If I&#39;m not mistaken, this typeface along with Adobe Serif weren&#39;t ever designed to be actually used. Were they? In the same sense that I use Garamond. They are strictly replacement fonts, right? Especially in display sizes. I would assume anyway. At smaller sizes the trap in the v would compensate and actually make the v look visually correct. At least that is how I understand it.</div>

And actually if you look at the initial sketches of Meta &#40;which can be seen in David Earls&#39;s new book&#41;, you&#39;ll see very sharp nicks all over. Even Optima can be said to have subtle nicks &#40;although Optima Next has had them all shorn off&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; BTW, I prefer the term &#34;thorn&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>&#62;Why would they make nicks in the photo days?</i> <BR> <BR>Gerald, nicks were used in photofilm for essentially the same reason that &#34;ink traps&#34; were used in metal, only in reverse. If you project light through an open shape with an acute angle, the light will tend to make the corner round. My recollection of physics and optics is a little fuzzy, but I think the phenomenon is called &#34;diffraction&#34; &#40;or is it &#34;diffusion&#34;?&#41;. This is basically the same principle that causes dappled light filtered through trees to appear as round, circular projections on the ground, even though the openings between leaves are random polygonal shapes. I believe the degree of rounding varies depending upon the thickness of the film substrate. <BR> <BR>You can try this experiment: Take a piece of card stock &#40;a 3x5 index card works well&#41; and cut a square opening in it, say half and inch or so. Place the card on a piece of paper and shine a desk lamp directly over it. Now, lift the edge of the card just slightly so that you can peek under and see the projected square of light on the paper. You&#39;ll notice that the corners of the projected square are not sharp. The closer the card is to the paper the sharper the image, but there will still be slight rounding in the corners. Nicks were used to compensate for this rounding. <BR> <BR>Karen, a &#34;nick&#34; -- Hrant&#39;s &#34;thorn&#34; is a little more descriptive -- is where an outside corner is exaggerated in its sharpness.  It&#39;s basically the negative image of the &#34;trap&#34; discussed above. <BR> <BR>I hope that&#39;s clear. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; Bit confused about the nick term. <BR> <BR>Exactly. Use &#34;thorn&#34; instead, it&#39;s ten times better. <BR>Oh, and what Kent said. <BR> <BR>BTW, thorns are not as obscure in digital as one might think. This morning I was looking at Nick Shinn&#39;s catalog, and some of his work has subtle thorns. The physical and optical loss of sharpness at smaller sizes makes them eternally useful. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Isaac, you got promoted to Regular because you crossed the 100-posts mark. Congrats! Feels good, innit? ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Gerald, the dfTYPE PDF is perfect didactic material. Great stuff! <BR> <BR>Hrant, I admit I&#39;ll have to take a closer look at Mr. Schwartz&#39; work. I really do like what he does though: tFB&#39;s <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=10442616123498246&amp;fontname=Pennsylvania"> Pennsylvania</a> and Emigre&#39;s <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=102"> Los Feliz</a> spring to mind, but he did so many good types it&#39;s getting difficult to keep track of his work. <BR>BTW last week I received the House Industries Catalogue No. 31 which extensively shows the <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=NEUTRAFACE-FO"> Neutraface</a> collection and it&#39;s a beauty to behold. I must say I wasn&#39;t really impressed when I first saw it online. Seeing it in print in extensive text settings completely reconciled me with considering using a Futura-like geometric sans as a text face though. Gorgeous work.</div>
