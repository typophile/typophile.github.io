  body: "thanks everyone. nick i understand that no one may be able to id it. but
    no responses make it hard to know if its that or being neglected due to a poorly
    timed post or topic name. that's why i resposted and it obviously worked in getting
    responses.\r\n\r\ni've never had a post stumped on this site. some seemingly MUCH
    harder than this (says me). i figured this wouldn't be so difficult. now i feed
    challenged.\r\n\r\ni'm not giving up on it cause it doesn't seem custom although
    some characters were tweaked that i did not include.\r\n\r\nif anyone else can
    help it would be appreciated. or if anyone can help with other means to identify
    fonts besides whatthefont and identifont. even if its nice tutorial sites on learning
    how to search better for font treatments or fonts similar to this.\r\n\r\nthanks
    for everyone's time! "

    would you withhold additional characters and information on where you found the
    sample?\r\n\r\nYou learn a lot about someone looking at their history on the forum.\r\n\r\nThe
    sad truth is that you've been a member for over (4) years but haven't bothered
    to contribute in any fashion other than to post ID requests and leech off those
    kind enough to help. Then you act surprised when we don't devote hours to find
    a typeface that may very well not exist.\r\n\r\nWhy should we help someone who
    hasn't bothered to help others?"

  body: "yes i have used this site to help me identify fonts and am very appreciative
    of people who are so good at it. isn't that what you're supposed to use this forum
    for? i have spent time investigating other people's requests and am just not good
    at it (other than the obvious answers and people have posted with replies while
    i was researching). i am not a type expert but i do love typography. this is why
    i turn to you pros. i'm not going to act like a fake type expert by providing
    no help and adding replies to other requests for the sake of people researching
    my site history.\r\n\r\ni'm not trying to hide anything here and am sorry such
    disgust has happened by me asking for help. if you don't want to help, then don't.
    but please don't criticize me for asking. in reading my post i apologize if the
    tone was not appreciative by assuming identifying the font would be easier than
    i thought.\r\n\r\nthe only other letters from the example are a custom curved
    R and custom Y made to look like a wine glass. i didn't think this would help
    id the font and would only increase the \"it's custom\" response likelihood. and
    it may be custom. if it does help, its from this site: http://culinaryculture.com/\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    find the tone of your post offensive. So nobody is supposed to post a font they
    need ID'd unless they have been actyively IDing them as well? Are you a mod here? "

  body: "@ efthomas: That's the beauty of this site... you don't have to be a type
    expert to participate in the design or general discussion areas. Type ID isn't
    easy and doing it before the likes of 'Jan' and 'Akira' is near impossible, unless
    they are sleeping.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to your previous post regarding this ID
    request? The one that you bumped every day with comments of shock that no one
    responded. The fact is I spent 30 minutes trying to help ID your request and it
    makes my blood boil to find out you chopped up the logo and sent us on a wild
    goose chase.\r\n\r\nHow you could withhold vital information like the name of
    the company and their website is beyond me. Only when I questioned why information
    was withhold did the truth come out. And because of it we're far closer to an
    answer.\r\n\r\nJust so you know, I found the designer through the 'About Us' page
    on the Culinary Culture website and emailed Jessica Hische directly for insight
    on the typeface. Seeing her portfolio I'm leaning heavily toward this being custom.
    It looks like she draws type like this in her sleep.\r\n\r\nI will apologize if
    my tone has been a bit harsh in the eyes of some but look at it from the perspective
    of someone who devotes a ton of time helping others ID type."

  body: "thanks minimalista and CreativeNRG! i emailed the creators of the website
    a few days ago asking about it but didn't get a response. it definitely sounds
    like it was custom. its really nice work by jessica. she is quite talented.\r\n\r\n@CreativeNRG
    i'm working on a project that is extremely time sensitive and i really liked the
    \"C\" and \"N\" since i needed those characters. this is why i was pushing to
    see if it was a font i could purchase or download. the topic of my first post
    seemed to me like i was asking someone to suggest a \"Nice compressed serif font\".
    so i recreated a post with a better topic name. \r\n\r\ni learned that it is important
    to include everything from now on instead of certain characters... including website
    information. i figured showing custom characters would hurt the id process but
    since i don't really know the id process i shouldn't have assumed. thank you for
    your efforts and i apologize if you spent a lot of wasted time.\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "The more information you can provide in an ID request the better. As a rule
    of thumb if you post something and don't hear back within a couple of hours it
    has people stumped and a red flag should go up that it might very well be custom.\r\n\r\nFrom
    my experience handwritten type can be the most difficult and time consuming to
    pin down.\r\n\r\neg. While searching tonight I accidently discovered a distinct
    aspect of a handwritten font that was requested over a week ago with no reply.
    It was just plain luck.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nBTW: Here's an official
    answer regarding your ID request... right from Jessica Hische herself.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"Hi
    Jeff,\r\nYou're correct, Culinary is indeed custom, based a bit on archer, which
    was used for the rest of the site. I only use fonts for tiny type or when I'm
    really short on time, so typically when you see something I've done all or most
    of the type is custom. Case closed! :)\r\n\r\nJ\"</cite>"
