  rock. Perhaps in the 70's 80's...maybe even early 90's. I never was really into
  that whole scene so I am somewhat lost. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am just beginning my search,
  so I don't have much information. I'm going to be looking around online tonight,
  but I decided to start off with a post in case anyone had some suggestions or interesting
  type-faces that are out there.\r\n\r\nBembo\r\n"

    era. See what the typography looked like. Then if you want, post some samples
    for IDs.'

  body: i love the fact that you classify 'older rock' as '70s, 80s, 90s'... cos,
    to this old fart, 'older rock' is '50s, 60s' max!

  body: "Well the thing is, I am not trying to completely mimic or copy a album logo,
    so I didn't write any bands down specifically. I'm trying to have maybe a typeface
    with similar qualities, or something else unique that someone could suggest.\r\n\r\nI
    will lists some bands I have been looking at. A lot of their logos are modified
    type, so its hard to tell what they are.\r\n\r\nPink Floyd\r\nLed Zeppelin\r\nRolling
    Stones\r\nTwisted Sister\r\nThe Who\r\nAerosmith\r\nThe Doors\r\nKiss ** I am
    leaning toward a type similar to this.\r\nACDC ** This gothic look is also interesting.\r\nGuns
    n Roses\r\nVan Halen\r\nThe Eagles\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: For Pink Floyd info, look up the amazing design firm Hypgnosis. They have
    a few books out, but I'm pretty sure they have plenty written about them online.
    Pink Floyd didn't typically use a lot of text on their album covers, but it can't
    hurt to look it up.

  body: "I am a big fan of Hipgnosis' work (Storm Thorgerson, George Hardie, et al)
    -- in addition to Pink Floyd, they also did Led Zeppelin's covers. The LZ logo
    seen starting with the album \"Houses of the Holy\" was based on <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/rennie-mackintosh/\"
    target=\"_blank\">lettering by Charles Rennie Mackintosh</a>. But just as with
    Pink Floyd, you didn't usually see too much text on their covers.\r\n\r\nThe AC/DC
    logo was drawn by <a href=\"http://www.gerardhuerta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gerard
    Huerta</a> (info from the man himself <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/20336\"
