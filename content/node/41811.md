  body: "By all accounts a remarkable personality, Prof R K Joshi was one of a small
    group of inspirational design educators of the old school, in India. Friends who
    studied under him at the IDC in Mumbai refer to him with a mixture of awe, near
    reverence and deep affection. \r\n\r\nHis enduring legacy would probably be the
    many designers he trained over the years, who now work across the country in diverse
    languages and scripts."
