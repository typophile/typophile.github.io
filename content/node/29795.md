    and squooshed it would work.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=E.105369.1.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=We+Are&sampleSize=48\"
    target=\"_blank\">Brothers Regular</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=E.105369.2.4&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=MARQUETTE&sampleSize=48\"
    target=\"_blank\">Bold</a> seem to match.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
