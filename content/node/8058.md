  body: That was the short answer, here is the long <BR> <BR>&#62;What is P22 going
    to do with Lanston?  <BR> <BR>---We will be re-releasing the Lanston Catalog starting
    on Jan. 1 2005. The initial selection will be an apparently random group of faces
    showing the range of what there is to offer. We will be adding glyphs, re-naming
    the fonts and going over the data for all fonts. <BR> <BR>&#62;What about those
    of us who have licensed type previously?  <BR>&#62;Will we get discounts for upgrades?  <BR>
    <BR>---Fonts can still be ordered from the Lanston site as before in the Giampa
    web site. Any purchases from now until before the remastered version are released
    will get free upgrades. Anyone who licensed before the P22 acquisition will get
    a very reasonable upgrade offer. <BR> <BR>&#62;Is Giampa

  body: Btw, my research on splines may well result in an improved IK to TT conversion.
    I only need about half as many &#34;digs&#34; &#40;in IK speak&#41; to make a
    smooth, round curve, which opens the door to a mostly-automated process for identifying
    digs that seem off-curve and tossing them. <BR> <BR>Email me at <a href="mailto:firstname.lastname@gmail.com">firstname.lastname@gmail.com</a>
    if you want to follow up on this privately.
