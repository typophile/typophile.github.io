  body: Which font? The logo is hand drawn. Consider <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/blambot/skin-deep-bb/?refby=typographica">Skin
    Deep</a> as a typeface alternative, but calligraphy is the best way to get that
    style.

  body: "I could have sworn I saw the logo font identified here, but I can't find
    it now. Given the duplicate characters (e, o, r), I think it's a font with some
    added swashes and an alternate y.\r\n\r\n"
