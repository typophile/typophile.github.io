  downloaded a typeface (for free) called \"Tshirt\". I can't recall the name of the
  site I got it from but I was a huuuge fan of it. Then I accidentally deleted it.
  DAMN! It's reminiscent of Helvetica but aged a little bit and some of the letters
  are a bit crooked. Needless to say, I'm trying to find it again. Here's a sample
  of it:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mainpic_5094.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nAny help
  from anyone would be greatly appreciated."
