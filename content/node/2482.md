body: Hi folks,  <BR> <BR>This sample came to me from someone asking if  I knew the
  font this embossing was done in. The big key to this mystery seems to be the ampersand.
  I went through the Serif and Slab Serif collections in the Font Book, and nothing
  had this symbol, so I am presuming that this is something newer than 1998 when that
  book was published. <BR> <BR>Any ideas? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>- Mike<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22714.gif"
