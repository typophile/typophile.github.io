body: Futura is one of my trusty most favorite typefaces. However, the question mark
  makes me want to throw up (crazy backward S). I work in exhibition design and frequently
  use question marks at large sizes as part of headlines etc. Museums like exhibits
  that pose questions to visitors. Does anyone know of a good substitute of alternate
  character? I don't know any font design program or I would design my own.

    about Eagle? I think you'd have to adjust the weight. (Purists would cringe, I
    know.)\r\n\r\n"

    It's got a question mark that you might like better. (Though IMHO it's not as
    strong a face as Futura.)\r\n\r\nI like Futura's question mark. It's got personality."

  body: Thanks for some great suggestions. The Futura Bold question mark is what I
    would want the Book to look. I knew some would cringe at the idea of "improving"
    a classic. I like this message board. Thanks for the points of view and...the
    attendant humor.
