body: "Any help with this much appreciated. It is from a book called Non-Sect Radical
  and it was published in 2004 by Yokohama Museum of Art. This is the main roman type
  used throughout. Difficult to capture the feel of the type in a scan, but the feature
  I most noticed is the angled lowercase 'e' which makes it feel subtly different
  on the page to some of the other types it resembles. The lowercase 'a' feels a bit
  like Venus or Monotype Grotesque but definitely not those. I fear it may be a custom
  type.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/james_4307.jpg]"

    that I have catalogued in the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html\">Sans
    Font ID Guide</a>, as far as I could tell. The search was a bit harder without
    the G and R, but there should have been enough letters to use the Guide.\r\n\r\n-

  body: I think this is a typical case of Latin characters that are incorporated in
    a Japanese font -- they do not correspond with a specific Latin typeface but are
    rather utilitarian add-ons.

    body: "I think Yves is right. This looks one of the weights of Rodin\r\nfrom Fontworks,
      a Japanese company in Fukuoka.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fwrodanm_3847.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
      company site is www.fontworks.co.jp, though\r\nyou need a Japanese enabled browser
      to view it.\r\nThere is a PDF at\r\n  www.fontworks.co.jp/pub/typeface/rodin_m.pdf\r\n\r\nBTW
      a good place to look for Japanese fonts is at\r\n  ohkadesign.cool.ne.jp/wabunfont/library.html\r\nAgain
      a Japanese enabled browser will help.\r\n"

      body: Thanks Tom, that's spot on, I'm very grateful to you. I have no experience
        of buying and using Japanese fonts. Will I be able to use the roman characters
        easily or are they likely to be in odd places in the character set? I want
        to buy the type but that site looks a little daunting!

        body: "The characters are all in the same places, but to use the font I assume
          you would have to install Japanese language support in your OS. That isn't
          so hard to do in XP, but I really don't know how far English language applications
          support it.\r\nOne possibility is that I could call the company and ask
          if they would consider releasing a subset with the roman characters only.
          Is there any way I can make my e-mail address visible to members?\r\n"

          body: "I'd want to use it in Mac OSX, specifically in Adobe InDesign. This
            Japanese site refers to Rodin in Opentype format which is encouraging:
            http://www.lets-member.jp/typography/classic/rodin.html \r\n\r\nThere
            are a few non-roman fonts pre-installed in my copy of InDesign, and I
            seem to be able to use both the roman and non-roman glyphs in at least
            one of them (Kozuka Mincho Std) so that suggests my system might be compatible.
            There are hundreds of glyphs in these fonts but the roman ones all seem
            to be in the usual places in the character set on my keyboard.\r\n\r\nYour
            offer to contact the company for me is very kind, any help or advice will
            be sincerely appreciated...\r\n\r\n"

              service. It's too expensive for\r\none font, but there must be a cheaper
              way.\r\nI found a switch in my settings that seems to allow e-mailing
              me\r\nthrough Typophile. If that works maybe you could mail me and we\r\ncould
