  Series</A>\r\n\r\nWhat great stuff! I particularly liked Francis Bacon's <em>Of
  Empire</em> and Jonathan Swift's <em>A Tale of a Tub</em>. While the titling of
  George Orwell's <em>Why I Write</em> looked all too familiar, just like a certain
  book that we all know well.\r\n\r\nFound via 37 Signal's Signal vs. Noise Blog."

    old books as well. Not hot metal, but a good simulation.\r\n\r\nPeculiar that
    the page for the second series (blue) is so much better than the first, with the
    rollovers."
