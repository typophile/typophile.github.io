  forums over the course of the past year, I have started a [[http://www.certtime.com|project]]
  to implement an online digital timestamping service. \r\n\r\nThe idea is to provide
  an easy way to establish and validate a proof of existence of any given piece of
  data, such as an image, so that such proof could later be used to facilitate dispute
  resolutions. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the context of Logopond discussions was how to
  facilitate take-downs of the ripped-off logo designs. Having a reliable time reference
  for an original work seems to substantially simplify such activity. It may also
  serve as a deterrent and help to prevent the cloning from happening in the first
  place.\r\n\r\nTimestamping is not rocket science, but its usefulness is generally
  affected by\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the complexity of stamp verification process -- this
  typically requires the use of specialized 3rd party software\r\n<li>the complexity
  of running a timestamping facility -- issuing a timestamp is easy, ensuring that
  the issuer cannot back-stamp at will is what's hard\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI have found
  a way to resolve both issues and make the whole process as straight forward as it
  can get. The details are [[http://logopond.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3578|here]]
  if you are interested.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI am posting this for two reasons. First,
  I want to obviously get the word out and announce the project. Second, I would like
  to gather the feedback. What do you guys think of the idea ? Not necessarily in
  the context of logos or images. Consider that <em>any</em> data can be timestamped.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nOh,
  and a teaser screenshot for the desert :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/item-info-2_4573.png]"

  body: Alex, although I am fully for providing designers with a tool to empower them
    to combat rip-offs. I don't really understand why this is any different than,
    say, the timestamp added to uploads on Flickr.

  body: "Good question :)\r\n\r\nThe main difference is the reliability of the timestamp.
    Flickr, for example, allows editing the photo after it was uploaded, replacing
    the original and keeping the 'uploaded' date and time. Which makes sense because
    the photo was indeed <em>uploaded</em> on that date.\r\n\r\nSecondary, lesser
    problem is that if I know someone in Flickr, I may potentially persuade them to
    change the timestamp by hand. \r\n\r\nIn other words, Flickr and alike were not
    <em>built</em> for trustworthy timestamping. Their time reference information
    can be manipulated post factum, either using native features, through exploiting
    flaws in the system design or via social engineering.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand
    there exists mature timestamping infrastructure that is a part of digital certificate
    issuing business. The very foundation that makes the SSL secure. Timestamps are
    generated by the sealed servers, servers are physically secured, their security
    is routinely audited by 3rd parties, etc. The whole nine yards. The likelihood
    of the timestamp coming out of this infrastructure to be fake, manipulated or
    mis-applied is virtually zero.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to start utilizing this infrastructure
    by building a system that is dedicated to just one thing and that does it right.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@neverblink: Yes, with an exception of executable files.\r\n\r\nInitially
    it is going to focus on images and related types, i.e. PNG/JPEG/etc and AI/PSD/PDF/etc.
    This has more to do with implementing the Preview/Thumbnail functionality rather
    with any technical issues with stamping process. \r\n\r\n@Dav: Thanks!"

  body: "<em>Fast forward mere nine months :)</em>\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe project is
    now alive and breathing.\r\n\r\nI had serious doubts along the way and almost
    scraped it once or twice. However in the end it seemed like an interesting experiment
    and a generally good thing to do, so it survived. \r\n\r\nI should probably add
    here that the goal is not to make money. The goal is to try and do something about
    rampant online plagiarism. This is not an ultimate solution, far from it, but
    it is one of those small things that could help, and help substantially.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nNow
    I crave for feedback. \r\n\r\nIf you think it's a dumb idea and it won't work,
    I would like to hear that. Especially that. If you have thoughts on what could
    make it work, please type them and post them.\r\n\r\nThe homepage is at https://beta.certtime.com\r\n\r\nI
    have put together a comprehensive Q&A page that covers all FAQs accumulated so
    far - https://beta.certtime.com/faq. If there are more questions that beg to be
    there, do let me know.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIf you feel like taking the service out
    for a test, punch in <em>AUGUST</em> as an invitation code when registering. Do
    keep in mind that it is a work in progress and parts of the site are still being
    worked on."
