body: "Having noted, from an ATF catalog, some time ago that 3-to-em and 5-to-em spaces,
  particularly, for many type sizes were not actually at their nominal sizes, but
  instead at even multiples of 1/4 or 1/2 point, I had wondered if this were true
  even for regular foundry typefaces, and not merely the \"Self-Spacing\" or \"Typotabular\"
  faces.\r\n\r\nI recently had the good fortune to have a look at the classic and
  celebrated work, \"Typographical Printing-Surfaces\", which has a wealth of information
  on many subjects related to typography. There is interesting information there about
  typesetting in some languages other than English, and about automatic typesetting
  machines other than Monotype and Linotype - which are also covered, as is a modification
  of the Linotype machine to cause it to cast individual types like a Monotype.\r\n\r\nIt
  gave a table of the widths of the characters in two 12-point foundry fonts. All
  the widths except one were multiples of 1/4 point, the other being a multiple of
  1/8 point. It seemed to me that there was a tendency to favor multiples of 3/4 point,
  which at first I took to be the unit of the system."

  body: "Your link only has \"snippet view\", probably because I'm in Canada, and
    Google is not sure when Legros and Grant passed away.\r\n\r\nBut, yes, I am indeed
    referring to the tables on pages 72 and 73. I have added a summary of the information
    from there to my own web page [[http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/propint.htm|here]]."
