  code]+[diacritic code]. But how to name letters when the combined diacritic has
  no codepoint?\r\n\r\nThis issue arises regarding L with double slash and Lambda
  with bar, both used in native North American languages. The slanted bar may be considered
  the 0337, but I'm not sure if this is correct. And the double Polish bar has no
  Unicode at all.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/namesunknown_4205.png]"

  body: "You should probably put it into the private use unicode section and work
    the substitution into the OpenType code for stylistic alternates or stylistic
    sets for language substitution. Or is there a code for languages? LANG? I don't
    remember now. I even go so far as to create unicodes for the elements of diacritics
    such as the macron over the \"i\" (macron.salt). I hate overhanging macrons. Even
    if you write the code for the substitution, you must have a unicode because some
    software doesn't see the character if it doesn't have a unicode. Also, the naming
    conventions should be something similar to lambda.salt or L.salt because some
    software and postscript printers won't recognise names outside that convention.
    Or, so I've read. That should give a starting point for further research until
    someone far more knowledgable than I (which wouldn't be hard) posts a better solution.\r\n\r\nJLS"

  body: "Igor, might the L/l with double slash be treated as glyph variants of U+2C60/U+2C61?\r\n\r\nIf
    not, then they should be proposed for encoding, because Unicode's preference now
    is to encode characters in which combining bars or slashes intersect with the
    base form, realising that the techniques for dynamic mark positioning that work
    so well for floating marks are problematic in this cases, and hence these text
    elements will tend to be displayed with precomposed glyphs.\r\n\r\nYes, the single
    combining slash is U+0337.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase Latin lambda with bar is encoded
    as U+019B, but it currently has no uppercase form encoded (it originated in Americanist
    phonetic notation, which uses only lowercase). If this uppercase form is in use,
    then it definitely needs to be documented and proposed for encoding."

  body: "James and John, thank you very much.\r\n\r\nAbout PUA codepoints, I'm following
    technical recomendations I received here in Typophile and thus I'm avoiding them
    by now. OT substitution would be an option if these characters were actual variations
    of others. But I do not know if the double slashed L is just a language variation
    from the single slashed version.\r\n\r\nUppercase barred lambda is included in
    [[http://www.tiro.com/huronia/Huronia_Beta_16_OL.pdf|Huronia Pro]], as well as
    the L with double slash. A non-barred version of Lambda is available in [[http://www.linguistsoftware.com/lsal.htm|LaserSalish
    fonts]]. Unhappily, I cannot find further information about them (maybe I should
    ask Ross Mills about it).\r\n\r\nCuriously, the lowercase Latin labda with slanted
    bar is used in Wikipedia as an icon to native North American languages. It seems
    to be a typical letter for some of these tongues.\r\n"

  body: The general rule is that glyph name should reflect the character(s) used as
    input to get this glyph, as the point of standardised glyph naming is to allow
    recovering the original input from an array of glyphs (e.g. in PDF files where
    the input text in not usually preserved but only the resulting glyphs).

  body: Khaled, this is a non standardised situation as the double slash is not available
    as separeted diacritic. Thus, there is no input to be emulated by some uni+0000
    combination.

    of my question: if I know how to name it, I could adopt a proper way to access
    it. Note there are a number of special keyboard layouts designed to make easier
    the input of less known languages \u2013and even specific text editors were developed
    to achieve the same.\r\n\r\nBTW, it always may be reach with a glyph panel."

  body: Why is there any need to see uni019B as a  composed character? To input uni019B
    or any unicode character (whether it looks composed or not), all you need is an
    appropriate keyboard. I see that there are more than 170 different <a href="http://www.languagegeek.com/keyboard_general/all_keyboards.html"><strong>keyboards
    for Ametican Native Languages</stong></a> on <a href="http://www.languagegeek.com/"><strong>languagegeek</strong></a>.
    There are also tools to make your own keyboard. Why is that not enough?

    uppercase, which does not have codepoint. Anyway, I consider the answer was given
    by John: the slanted bar is the U+0337 diacritic and a simple uni+0000+0000 naming
    schema is enough.\r\n\r\nThe remaining doubt is how to name L/l with double bar."

    and the proposed use is quite different, I must confess. I have nothing to add
    to what John said.\r\n\r\nAdded: If I felt I had no choice but to find something
    (but never to make public), I might be tempted to use U+20EB as the combining
    diacritical for L and l even if the bars are \"too long\"; my guess is that it
    is unlikely that such a choice could cause any conflict for any personal use.
    For a font to make public, that is unclear."

  body: Igor, checking Huronia, it looks like Ross handled the l with double slash
    as a 'ccmp' composition of l + short combining slash + short combining slash.
    That's a clean encoding at least, although I still think this letter should be
    proposed for separate encoding.

  body: "The double-barred 'l', or double slash 'l' are used in Ktunaxa (Kootenay)
    orthographies as a voiceless l. You could see the barred l (\u0142) used (eg.
    in Boas), the double-slashed l or the double-barred l. Given the last is encoded,
    the double-slashed l could be mapped as a variant of either \u0142 or \u2C61,
    in lieu of it having a separate encoding. It could also be mapped via [ccmp].
    I would tend to say you're more likely to see the double-bar form.\r\n\r\nThe
    uppercase barred lambda is included for the sake of complete typographic case
    options for the orthographies which use the barred lambda. It is a logical inclusion
    (at least from a typographic standpoint), and I try to at least give users the
    options of having uppercase, lowercase and smallcaps for most everything. People
    typesetting eg. Nuuchahnulth have said they would like an uppercase option (and
    by extension a smallcap option). If any precedent is set for such use, then it
    of course should get encoded as the uppercase form of \u019B\u2014as it stands,
    access mapping via OT lookups could probably be done in a couple of ways; none
    particularly elegant that spring to mind. \r\n\r\nIncidentally, unless you are
    relying solely on mark positioning, there should probably be a precomposed version
    of the glottal-barred-lambda as well which needs fairly careful positioning of
    the glottal mark. The lambda and barred lambda* are used in Salish languages as
    voiced and voiceless lateral affricatives (both can take a glottal). Traditionally
    there has been no uppercase version because, well, no one bothered to make them.\r\n\r\n*The
    subject of 'latinate' Greek for the purpose of phonetics has been covered elsewhere.\r\n"
