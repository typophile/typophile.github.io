  body: The top two are pretty clever, because they contain both the letters E and
    C for "Electric Car" or "Electric Charging" and they also have a stylized electric
    plug.  The bottom two lose the letter C.

  body: "Thanks both!\r\n\r\nSomeone pointed out to me that the plugs for the cars
    in the US don't look like the plug here.. so it was hard to associate to a Car
    charger. it's a good point. it seems the actual plugs differ from country to country
    (which isn't very practical), so i'm trying to go for something more universal...
    for electrical."

  body: "Very smart, clean, simple and meaningful.\r\n\r\nI don't think the actual
    difference in the plugs is important. The two-connection plug with cord is a kind
    of universal sign, even if the plugs in use are somewhat different. I guess you
    created an icon destined to be worldwidely applied."

  body: For me, the shape of the plug is unimportant; what plugs DO and HOW THEY WORK
    is key. What sold me on the top two is that the plug is CONNECTED to a power source
    (the implied cord coming out of the plug).

    representation. Congratulations. (I too prefer the upper versions.)

  body: "The top 2 look nice, although the \"E\" and \"C\" shapes will obviously not
    be meaningful in all languages as the words for charging/car/electricity will
    vary from country to country. But of course it's the plug and cord shapes that
    carry the main message.\r\n"

    all that's in there everywhere in the world (hell, some of my friends saw sleeping
    Bears and white and black pigs in there!! :)), but at least that the main feature
    (which is the plug and connection) are visible and dominant.\r\n\r\nThis will
    be eventually used as a standard dingbat in my fonts and most likely also as a
    free dingbat font.. it should be out there, where it belongs.\r\n\r\nthanks again.\r\n\r\nA"
