  and I rather like its outputs.\r\nProblem is it autohints .PFA or OTF files and
  I would like to have these hints in my FL (or UFO) masters.\r\nIs there a way to
  export the AFDK generated hints in the OTF font back to my FL master file?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nR."

    them and it works. Now I can run the AFDK autohinting inside FL. The script that
    calculate V and H stems is also very cool. I like it :)\r\nIt is a pity that Miguel
    Sousa's PDFs do not mention that you can run these scripts inside Fontlab."

  body: Note that running the AFDKO autohint script in FontLab does not write flex
    hints; if you want flex hints, you need to run the external autohinter. I've got
    it in the back of my head that there are other differences too.

  body: Wait... but after you have run the AFDK auto hinting inside FL with the script,
    you can correct what you want and press the "Automatically generate Flex hints..."
    check box when necessary. Or won't it work?

  body: "I found this: \r\n\r\n\"Not the macro, but FontLab Studio. All you have to
    do is to activate flexhint generation in the FontInfo dialog of FLS (Not in the
    options dialog!). FLS will add the flexhinting. Note, that this will not destroy
    the autohinting from the macro! There is no disadvantage with regard to the macro.
    Just use the bug fixed version, because then you can choose, if you want to generate
    hints with or without replacement.\r\nIf you want to convince yourself, just autohint
    your font one time with the macro (with activated flexhint option) and one time
    from the command line (with flexhint option). Then decompile the name table of
    both font files with TTX and compare them with the help of a program like UltraCompare.|\r\n\r\nFrom:

  body: "Richard: \u2018<em> [\u2026] one-page summary of DTL's product line [\u2026]
    the main strengths simply stated.</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nCurrently we have the following
    range of products (I cut and pasted some of the following texts from the DTL web
    sites):\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>DTL FontMaster suite</strong>\r\nDTL
    FontMaster is a set of utilities for professional font production. It includes
    a module for designing and editing letters in bezi\xE9r format (BezierMaster),
    interpolating fonts (BlendMaster), testing and correcting glyph contours (ContourMaster),
    generating and converting font formats (DataMaster), the editing of the IK format
    (IkarusMaster), generating and editing kerning pairs (KernMaster) and scanning
    and auto-tracing letters and logos (TraceMaster).\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DTL
    BezierMaster, DataMaster, and IkarusMaster contain the modi\uFB01ed URW++ version
    of Adobe\u2019s Hatch Open Type (HOT) tool, which is also part of OTM. This means
    that the character set does not have to match the characters listed in the OpenType
    Layout features \uFB01le, because all features that are not covered by the character
    set will be removed automatically (\u2018subset\u2019) during compiling. All FM
    modules are batch-oriented.\r\n\r\nFM is currently only available for Windows.
    Newly programmed versions of a couple of the listed modules will become available
    for OS X, to start with KernMaster 2012 this year. Perhaps we will make a separate
    module for manual digitizing under Mac OS X, which IkarusMaster currently supports
    for Windows.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>DTL OTMaster</strong>\r\nThis
    is a sort of Swiss knife for OpenType and TrueType fonts. One can use the application
    on a relatively simple level for altering for instance name tables or for adding,
    removing, or editing glyphs. Because of the modi\uFB01ed HOT tool, it is also
    very easy to generate OT layout tables using an \u2018all covering\u2019 features
    \uFB01le.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OTM can also be used for entering
    and altering the guts of .otf and .ttf fonts, for editing mark positioning using
    a GUI (one could for instance import an existing feature \uFB01le for for instance
    Arabic, and subsequently put the marks on their appropriate places)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>DTL
    CompareMaster</strong>\r\nA small program for comparing the metrics, hinting,
    and contour data of OTF with OTF, OTF with Type1, and Type1 with Type1 fonts.
    The contours (showing the differences) can be plotted as PS files.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>DTL
    LetterModeller</strong>\r\nThis gives you some idea of a future program for parametrized
    type design and font editing, which we are working on.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FEB\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Frank - doing a copy paste on this. Succinct is hard to do, but you've
    certainly done it.\r\nSomewhere, not sure where yet, I'll be writing up something
    on font tools.\r\n\r\nThe only thing missing is the comparison to the feature
    sets of the other products on the market. I mean, being an OTMaster user, I certainly
    know what it does for me that I can't get with other tools. But I had to find
    that out for myself and it was harder than it should of been. AND I could easily
    have passed OTMaster by and still be stuck scripting TTX or something like that.
    (Somebody on T-phile, once characterized OTMaster as 'TTX on steroids'.  Not a
    bad description.)\r\n\r\nBTW - I am ASSUMING that demo versions of all are available?\r\n\r\nrich"

    Ramiro, I de\uFB01nitely will do this.\r\n\r\nNick: \u2018<em>What about HintMaster
    [\u2026]</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t have a separate autohinting tool. The
    ones included in the FM tools are very good though; the cradle for the hinting
    technology stood in Hamburg at URW, after all. A couple of years ago (I think
    it was in Frankfurt) Miguel Sousa and I compared Adobe\u2019s Type1 hinter with
    the URW++ one, and I recall that Miguel was impressed. When it comes to TrueType
    hinting, the IKARUS-based tools are also very good. But, again, we don\u2019t
    have a separate hinting tool &ndash;at least not at this moment.\r\n\r\nRichard:
    \u2018<em>The only thing missing is the comparison to the feature sets of the
    other products on the market.</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nI will see if we can improve the
    information on this. Over the years we organized exclusive FM conferences in \u2019s-Hertogenbosch,
    The Hague, and Hamburg, and also almost every year FM sessions at the ATypI conferences
    (which we sponsor also every year), where the functionality was discussed. So
    far, we did not receive many invitations for other conferences on font technology.
    Our experience is, that the majority of people interested in our products have
    an IKARUS background and are technically very savvy. And I must underline here
    that all the DTL/URW++ products are developed for internal use in the \uFB01rst
    place anyway.\r\n\r\nRichard: \u2018<em>BTW - I am ASSUMING that demo versions
    of all are available?</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nYes, you can download these from the <a
    href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/english/downloads.html\"> <em>DTL FontTools</em>
    web site</a>.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"

    TT autohinting. I'll download whatever seems like the appropriate demo app, but
    exactly which product(s) would I need for that, Frank?"
