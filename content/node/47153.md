  problems you might see.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LuvAce_5760.gif]

  body: The L looks allright, the u is hard to read (too thin) the E looks to be the
    only lowercase and is also too light, same with your c. Cool concept though.

    you need to ariculate the stroke endings a bit more. I tweaked the u/c a bit too."

  body: Hack away. I love the u/c, thank you. The problem I have with the L/E is the
    eye see the L as a backward E too easily. That is the sticky tricky part.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LA_3719.gif]

  body: I think it is the middle spur of the L/E pair. If it had more of a curve maybe?
    On the L down and on the E up?
