  body: I&#39;ve read of people doing it, there have been programs written to do it,
    so yes, it&#39;s possible. But I have never done it, and it sounds...somewhat
    painful. If I understand it correctly, you need to translate a binary font metric
    file into ASCII &#40;PFM to AFM&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve heard that you can find
    the AFM file for almost any Postscript printer font at Adobe&#39;s FTP site, though
    I&#39;ve never been there to confirm it. It would probably take some serious digging
    to find, but it&#39;s out there somewhere. <BR> <BR>If you have a p2p application,
    do a filename search.
