body: Hey all. So I&#39;m finally getting down to making some type instead of thinking
  and talking about it. My first experiment is on a &#40;sorry in advance&#41; handwriting
  font to match up with one of my clients&#39; corporate face. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m running
  the Scanfont/TypeTool combo &#40;sorry, I won&#39;t be upping the ante to FontLab
  until I get my sorry &#149;&#149;&#149; up to OSX&#41;. <BR> <BR>The specific problem
  I&#39;m encountering now is that the screen version of the font looks quite terrible.
  For the most part this doesn&#39;t bother me as it&#39;s printing alright. But I&#39;m
  thinking if I get around to letting this face into the world then I should do what
  I can to make it more usable for folks. <BR> <BR>What is it that I need to learn
  to make a font display sort of ok on screen?  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance, free beer
  in Vermont, Hello Hrant, <BR> <BR>g <BR>

    going to upgarde to FontLab &#40;which may be able to auto-hint your font satisfactorily
    - but maybe not, since it&#39;s handwriting&#41;, you have four choices: <BR>1&#41;
    Hint it manually using Fog. This is the normal practice for high-end fonts, but
    mucho work, plus Fog&#39;s hinting is half-baked. <BR>2&#41; Edit the GASP Table
    so that it renders anti-aliased at all sizes, so that the lack of hinting doesn&#39;t
    matter. Problems: you&#39;ll need special software &#40;although VTT is free&#41;;
    and it assumes the font will be used on an operating system that has smoothing
    enabled. <BR>3&#41; Edit bitmaps. This isn&#39;t as bad as some people will have
    you believe, although it&#39;s too much work if you have to do too many point
    sizes, plus some OSes won&#39;t support it. <BR>4&#41; Leave it as is and tell
    the client they can&#39;t afford the real thing. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'The GASP table is something in a TT font that tells the screen renderer at
    what PPEM &#40;screen point&#41; sizes to use hinting and/or bitmaps. The only
    no-cost way to edit it that I know of &#40;short of hand-editing binary code&#41;
    is by using VTT: <BR><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/News.asp?NID=655"
    target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/News.asp?NID=655</a>
    <BR>What you would do is tell it to ignore hinting at all sizes. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    What OSes won&#39;t support the hand edited bitmaps?  <BR> <BR>Good question...
    <BR>I&#39;m behind the times on the Mac side, but I&#39;ve heard that newer MacOSes
    ignore bitmaps.  :-&#40; <BR> <BR>Insight into this would be really appreciated.

  body: So it&#39;s just buggy, but they actually intend[ed] to support embedded bitmaps?
    BTW, note that system font &#40;as well as most &#34;high-end&#34; fonts&#41;
    don&#39;t have embedded bitmaps; they use delta-hinting to get clean 1-bit rendering.

    figure out what the client needs &#40;and/or what you want him to think he needs&#41;

    or later I&#39;ll get done with it &#40;it currently supports Western European
    languages, I want to support as many languages as House Industries does with Chalet,
    they&#39;re sort of my model in terms of language support; a future version would
    hit Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, and Papazian style alphabets and a 3rd version
    might tackle Chinese and Katakana&#41;. And I want it to be considered a well
    made font. It prints as intended, I want people to feel the the computer representation
    is accurate enough. <BR> <BR>What beginning computer font designers realllllly
    need is a basic tutorial on the issues. First a big gloss of the main issues,
    then the nitty gritty...  <BR> <BR>Hrant &#40;since I know you know a lot of this,
    and I know you&#39;re going to read this&#41;... What would the table of contents
    of a book called Digital Typeface Development look like? <BR> <BR>thx, g <BR>
