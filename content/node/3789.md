  body: 'Edward -- thanks for pointing this out. Sounds like a huge volume to slowly
    consume, but this abridged version shows that it can be read by all interested
    in design and order. I especially like point 15: <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>Designs
    should be connected and complementary, not egocentric and isolated.<!-/quote-!><hr
    size=0></blockquote> <BR> <BR>Sounds like the perfect recipe for any project &#40;design&#41;
    that hopes to succeed.'
