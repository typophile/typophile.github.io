  for my brand script. The other fonts i've compared it to just dont seem to have
  the same look. \r\n\r\nHOWEVER - the 'g' looks uncannily like a 'q'.. what'd be
  the best method of making it more like a 'g'? Would it be a matter of taking the
  'flick' off another letter such as the U, M, or N Etc..\r\n\r\nWould love to have
  some suggestions - the other alternative is find a similar one.."
