  OpenOffice tells me the font used\r\nis Century Gothic and Century Gothic Bold\r\nbut
  it can't load it.\r\n\r\nWell I've had a look at the font and noticed\r\nthe uppercase
  M looks different to Century\r\nGothic. The stems in the clients print out\r\nare
  straight where as my M is angled.\r\n\r\nIs there a version with different letters\r\navailable?\r\n\r\n\r\ncheers"

    It could be the Adobe Sans Substitution font at work.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
