  you suggest a font that will complement the logo I've attached?\r\n\r\nWould you
  use the same font for all the information (ie. name, address, phone number) or would
  you use a couple different fonts?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I would use a lighter weight of a sans serif for the address etc. As it is
    now the logo is already over powered with the extra bold font.
