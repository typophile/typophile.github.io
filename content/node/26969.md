    target="_blank"> News Gothic</a>/<a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=108034334919162&amp;fontname=BentonSans"

  body: TC -- It looked like Bell Gothic in the masthead paired with Requiem. Really
    bizarre considering the rest of the magazine seems to be using a Trade Gothic
    looking typeface.
