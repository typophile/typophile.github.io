To keep things fair, we let you—the customer—be the ultimate judge of results by using sales numbers to decide each winner. Thank you for putting together such a nice list!"

Look at what's popular in music, a lot of garbage, and the real gems get discovered only by those in the know. I designed Zaner 1) because I loved the style and thought it deserved reviving in digital format and 2) because I thought it would sell well, as the masses buy scripts. I don't think the masses care as much about workhorse text faces, unfortunately. Welcome to the market economy.
All said, it's an honor to be included in this list, even if it is a bit of a popularity contest, and thank you, Tim, for the congrats.</div>

You can find grunge fonts on many Best Seller lists. Currently 4 (you could consider more grunge) on Myfonts top 50 and 1 in Veer's listing of what's hot.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think this is a reflection of MyFonts' market position. It's the populist type site, presenting itself more to casual users than learned designers. Anyone not well versed in typography is going to take more to the overt uniqueness of a display face than the subtleties in design and craftsmanship of a great text face. (Just went through this advising my old college newspaper on their redesign... tried to explain why Adobe Jenson is not the best choice for a newspaper.) Plus, non-designers tend to think more in terms of individual elements than the whole picture, meaning they may see more conservative text fonts as boring, while designers visualize the same font in context as rich and expressive. I'm sure that if you looked at other resellers, they'd have totally different bestsellers.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Colin, Myfonts has a multiple personality. As part of being e-populist, it is an exemplary Long Tail company, meaning that most of its sales come from most of its products, not the few best sellers. So on the one hand, it hypes its big hits in the de rigueur dumbarse manner, but at the same time it makes a huge quantity of fonts from hundreds of foundries available. There's quality there, of all kinds, to satisfy typographers with the most exquisitely recondite taste.

Myfonts also has some of the best (and no doubt most used) font info and font previewing mechanisms around, for its savvy clientelle.</div>

Ugly: Korataki, DearJoe4, Boycott. (In general I'm not that keen on Larabie's work, ubiquitous as it may be, so Korataki is maybe a victim of my bias. Dear Joe just does nothing for me. Boycott is just...well, let's say I'll boycott it.)

The others I'm not keen on, but to each their own, I suppose. Camingo and Cyan are nice enough, and Estilo Script is well done, but totally not my style. Zaner is a little too swooshy for me.

But that doesn't mean they have to be <em>made</em> like crap, i.e. designed or drawn badly. Also, isn't it more accurate to say that many "grunge" faces look rough, or weatherbeaten, or distressed? IMO there are good and bad ways of doing this, as with any other type style.

Also, speaking of grunge fonts, Rian Hughes of Device recently unveiled <a href="http://67.59.169.170/cgi-bin/device2.cgi?action=fonts&section=browse&font=0&filter=new" target="_blank">a whole mess of new grunge fonts</a>... and he's on MyFonts, too.

		<div class="commentbody">I had thought for some time that grunge is a bit of a misnomer because it's a little too all-inclusive. I have an "Antiquated & Distressed" category in FontExplorer that is quite different from most grunge fonts. One font I use from time to time is Caslon Antique, it looks slightly weathered/distressed to my eyes, but it doesn't strike me as grunge at all. 

I think part of why grunge fonts are so popular is that they are a quick means of getting some personality/attitude in a project for those not having the talent or time to do it by hand (or mouse).

Not that I'm always thrilled to use them, but some customers of mine are really hot on them so I can't avoid them entirely. Most of the time I can take an existing "normal" font and add my own "grunge" to it, generally the results are better, I have more control, it's a compromise I can live with.</div>

I don't consider it grunge, no. Unfortunately there are some who do, which can make keyword searches frustrating when you get returns that don't belong in the results (look at the bottom keyword descriptions):

As far as its age, I was not aware it was quite that old, no, but I knew well enough it was around long before what is (or should be) considered grunge came into being.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that there are obvious differences between distressed type, type that looks like it was printed hundreds of years ago, and grunge. I can really dig the first two, but to me grunge still just looks gross, no matter how much thought and craft went into designing it. I think of grunge type as the type that came out of the 1990s rock music scene, stuff that's really been manipulated to just look dirty and ugly. It was certainly appropriate for that context—most of the music was commercial crap that sounded dirty and ugly, as was much of the music journalism—but now I just wish that grunge type would disappear like the bands of that era did. 

<cite>I think part of why grunge fonts are so popular is that they are a quick means of getting some personality/attitude in a project for those not having the talent or time to do it by hand (or mouse).</cite>

I see a lot of that. A designer hasn't got a good idea, or doesn't want to put time into something, so she just slaps a nice photo on a page and sets the type in Guilty at a precarious angle. Two hours later she's trying to pass the design the design off as dynamic and edgy.</div>

That was supposed to be ironic. The amount of legal licenses in certain markets is not an indicator for its popular usage. In countries that have some awareness of IP, there are probably ten illegitimate copies to one legal one. In other places, that relationship is probably exponential rather than a multiplication.</div>

Exponential also includes power of 2 or 3. At any rate, what i am trying to say is that the amount of illegal use of fonts is higher in some countries than others, and not by a small amount.</div>
