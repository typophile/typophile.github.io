  script out there?\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "There are quite a few faces that have non-OpenType versions with both lining
    and oldstyle figures, in separate fonts--especially FontFonts. \r\n\r\nI've published
    a few typefaces, prior to OpenType, where the default is oldstyle figures e.g.
    <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/bodoni.html\">Bodoni Egyptian</a>, <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/paradigm.html\">Paradigm</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/preface.html\">Preface</a>.\r\n\r\nThere are
    also many OpenType fonts that have oldstyle figures as the default.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nick, many thanks for the response.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to use oldstyle figures
    in OpenType fonts, because you can turn the setting on for an entire chapter of
    a book. But if I wanted to use oldstyle figures in an non-OpenType font with both
    lining and oldstyle figures in separate fonts, is there an efficient way to convert
    the lining figures to oldstyle figures without having to individually format each
    number?\r\n\r\nThat actually was my question, but I may not have stated it clearly."

  body: "What I'm referring to is U&lc fonts where the ONLY difference is that one
    has old style figures as the default, and the other has lining figures. So, a
    different beast than the \"SC + OSF\" font.\r\n\r\nBut even if you are using \"U&lc
    + LF\" and you want to convert the figures to those in the SC+OSF font, you could
    use \"find/replace\" (if your app has a change-font component in that search feature."

  body: "If your version of InDesign happens to be the latest -- CS4 -- you can simply
    use a GREP style to toggle a font for digits only.\r\n\r\nIn short: create a <em>character
    style</em>, only defining the font for the alternate digits; then, in the appropriate
    paragraph styles, create a new GREP style. Coincidentally, these are predefined
    with \"\\d\" -- i.e., \"all digits\" -- so all you have to do is set the character
    style.\r\n\r\nAnd for older versions of ID, I'd suggest creating a character style
    and simply use search-and-replace to find all digits -- use \"^9\" as search code
    -- and replace with no text, and in formatting: your character style.\r\n\r\nNote
    that <em>both</em> options heavily rely on the fact that the digits should have
    the regular character codes (as you are only changing the font). If you have a
    font with both lining and oldstyle digits, you cannot use this trick and have
    to manually replace each digit one by one."

  body: "Another option is to have someone (or ask the foundry) to generate a custom
    version of the font for you with the oldstyle figures in the U&lc font. I used
    to do this for some of my book work -- after either ascertaining that the standard
    EULA allows such modifications (i.e. Adobe fonts) or contacting the foundry for
    permission to do so.\r\n\r\nIt was precisely this frustrating experience that
    led me to develop Whitman with two different figure style fonts and convince FB
    to release it that way. (This was prior to OpenType.)"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions everyone. I'm using InDesign CS3 and will try
    the ^9 replacement shortcut.\r\n\r\nI use Macs, and was wondering if I could use
    a program like this to convert typefaces with separate sc/oldstyle figure fonts
    into a singe OpenType font that would allow me to quickly select oldstyle figures
    for an entire document?:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/transtype/\r\n\r\nIf
    so, it would be worth the cost to me."

    a single OT font and write the appropriate OTL features for accessing SC and OsF
    through the relevant InDD commands.\r\n\r\nSomeone with more experience will have
    to tell us whether it provides tools for doing so manually.\r\n\r\n"
