  is the new (beautiful) passport of Norway, besides the passport itself I also like
  the typeface. To me it's like a mix between futura an neutraface but I can't fully
  identify it. Do you know what it is? Thanks in advance"

    but that's not it. Reminds me of [[http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/DTLNobel.html|Nobel
    DTL]] but /G is off. Found some similarities with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hurme-design/hurme-geometric-sans|Hurme
    Geometric Sans No.1]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nonpareille/battling|Battling]]
    and [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/overview|Whitney]] without being
    any of them.\r\n\r\nEDIT: guess I found it, could be [[https://monokrom.no/fonts/telefon|Telefon]]
    by Monokrom\r\n\r\nEDIT2: confirmed by Mexitexi"
