  execpt for Da Vinci? I have found Da Vinci very hard to read. A friend of my wife
  is looking for such a font to create letters/templates etc: for her business. Something
  like a San-Serif, Times New Roman, Courier, Arial et al would be nice.'

    this is the look you&#39;re looking for.

  body: Yes, I saw one awhile ago named KCAB.  A quick Google pulled <a href="http://www.grsites.com/modperl/fontview.cgi?dir=k&amp;fn=KCAB">this</a>
    up. <BR> <BR>This site makes it look like freeware/linkware.  I have no idea if
    it actually is.  I haven&#39;t done any research on it at all, other than remembering
    the name and Googling it.  So although it&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re looking
    for, you should probably do a few background checks first.
