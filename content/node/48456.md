body: "Greetings!\r\n\r\nI would love to get some critique on this typeface that I'm
  working on, tentatively named Jatiya*.  A bit about my intent:\r\nJatiya is meant
  to be a [[Tamil]] typeface designed as a companion to the Latin/Greek/Cyrillic typeface
  [[Gentium]], by [[Victor Gaultney]].  I'd like for it to mesh well with the look
  of Gentium, so that it looks good typeset side-by-side or in a setting like a dual-language
  dictionary.  Ideally, I'd like for it to be a strong stand-alone text typeface as
  well.\r\nSo far I've designed most of the basic consonants and vowels, but I have
  yet to start on the myriad conjuncts and ligatures, or the numbers and symbols.
  \ However, before I complete the character set I'd like to make sure that the design
  characteristics I've implimented so far are working.\r\n\r\nI have very little experience
  designing type, so I'd like critique on anything you notice, but I'm especially
  interested in a few things:\r\n- How well the Tamil is working with Gentium;\r\n-
  if the terminals (which are the same terminals used in Gentium) work with the Tamil
  glyphs;\r\n- and if the curves and shapes are aesthetically pleasing.\r\n\r\nPlease
  be brutally honest!  I'm interested in learning as much as I can.\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much!\r\n\r\n-Ria\r\n\r\n* Jatiya, as far as I can tell (I don't speak Tamil,
  unfortunately), means \"national,\" which is the closest translation I can find
  to match with Gentium's meaning, \"of the nations.\""

    order to examine, whether a text typeset in a new font is readable, it is necessary
    that the designer is able to read texts typeset in this font. Since you don't
    speak Tamil, I guess that you are also illiterate as far as written Tamil texts
    are concerned, e.g. Tamil newspapers, books, etc.\r\n\r\nSo, to be brutally honest,
    as requested by you, I suggest that you refrain from designing fonts for texts
    which you cannot read.\r\n\r\nAs regards \"Jatiya\", this is a non-Tamil loanword.
    A name for a Tamil font should use an original Tamil word, not a non-Dravidian
    loanword."

  body: "Ria\r\nPlease ignore Uli. One can certainly design a typeface for a language
    that you don't read. It takes the same kinds of skills that it takes for designing
    a Latin typeface. But because we (that's a general we) aren't familiar with scripts
    we don't read, we must do more work in the forms of research and study, looking
    at things like character proportions and examining what the essential characteristics
    of each glyph are. To really judge any typeface design, you really need to see
    it set in text and not only as separate glyphs. You might try stealing an article
    from wikipedia, setting it, and removing any non defined characters. Although
    this results in something that is utter garbage from a text point of view, the
    idea is that it at least <em>looks like</em> text enough to start being able to
    judge how the characters are working together. It would be helpful to see someting
    in all tamil and something in a mixed script setting. If you can do that, perhaps
    someone can make some useful suggestions for you."

  body: "Thank you, Paul!  I have done quite a bit of research into the Tamil letterforms
    and their history, and I've looked at many other Tamil typefaces to observe proportions,
    stroke contrast, etcetera, so I'm not going into this blind, but I <em>was</em>
    worried that what Uli said would be true; that having not grown up immersed with
    this script, I wouldn't be able to design a typeface for it.  So thank you for
    confirming my hope that the task is at least possible!\r\n\r\nI've put together
    a PDF with a paragraph of typeset Tamil, one of Tamil mixed with a few lorem ipsums,
    and one mostly latin with just a few Tamil words: http://people.cca.edu/randerson2/jatiya_text_samples.pdf\r\n\r\nUli;
    I quite agree that, assuming I finish this, it shouldn't be named with a loan-word.
    \ I'm open to naming suggestions if you have any; otherwise, I'll keep looking.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\nRia"

  body: "Ria,\r\n\r\nI liked your typeface overall. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome personal thoughts:\r\n\\
    The headline of your Tamil typeface at the moment is aligned to the x-height,
    what if someone set the type with all caps? Wouldnt your Tamil look too small
    then? Also, your tamil characters look a little dense compared to the Latin. You
    should set two separate paragraphs along side and check whether the greys of the
    text blocks are even or not.\r\n\\ Some of your characters are a little narrower
    I think (e.g. - \"ii\", \"rra\", vowel sign \"aa\", \"ra\") and some of which
    are a bit wider( e.g. - \"pa\", \"u\").\r\n\\ The descenders are too small.\r\n\\
    Vowel \"Ai\" is too big?\r\n\\ The final stroke of the Letter \"ka\" should not
    connect to the body.\r\n\\ The endings of the top horizontal stroke of the letters
    like \"ka\", \"ta\", \"na\" should be consistent throughout.\r\n\\ In your paragraphs,
    the dot(pulli) is misplaced all over. It should come exactly in the center(visually)
    of the character.\r\n\\ Also the vowel sign \"i\"  and \"ii\" should connect properly
    with the consonant. ( You might need to create some separate ligatures for these
    combinations)\r\n\\ The curves are not smooth and consistent throughout, there
    are lot of places where they are taking a sudden change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Its a
    great design and I would love to see this along with some ligatures in a proper
    text set next to the Latin.\r\n\r\nAll the best.\r\n\r\n"

    to see whether the Typophile moderators Paul D. Hunt etc. protect font cloners

    a few modifications to the serifs of existing fonts is the easiest font forging
    method for budding font forgers (see http://www.forgers.de)."

  body: "Yikes.\r\n\r\nTo start; this font is NOT a ripoff; I drew all the curves
    by hand, I didn't trace over any other font, and I most certainly did not just
    tack serifs onto a pre-existing font.  Literally the only parts of the face that
    I didn't draw are the terminals; I took them from Gentium (which, AFAIK, is permissable
    under its license), and that was not with intent to steal; it was so that the
    two faces would share some visual unity.\r\n\r\nXavier, could you possibly post
    an image of what the typeface used in the local newspapers looks like?\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure how I can prove that this is my original creation, but if it would help,
    I can list the typefaces that I looked at when familiarizing myself with the script.
    \ I looked at them not to copy them, but to learn some acceptable deviations of
    the shapes, where the stroke contrast fell, character widths, etc.  At no time
    did I just copy a shape from one of them; I looked at many, saw how that character
    related to others in that typeface, then tried to design a character that would
    fit in with the appearance of mine.  The fonts I looked at are:\r\nFrida Tamil\r\nMonotype
    Tamil 580\r\nLatha\r\nAnamika\r\nRajraja\r\nNandini\r\nDharini\r\nPremnath\r\nand
    the numerous fonts shown in this catalog: http://www.modular-infotech.com/downloads/fonts/tamuniv.pdf\r\n\r\nI
    also looked through the Indic Scripts pool on Flickr, at the pictures of hand-painted
    Tamil signs.\r\n\r\nWith all that being said... I'm troubled that my face looks
    so similar to a pre-existing one.  I'd really like to see HOW similar it is so
    I can determine whether I should still try to finish it or if I should try to
    design something more unique.\r\n\r\nXavier; I chose to try to design a Tamil
    typeface because I think the script is beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd with all that
    being said; I'd still like some critique of my design, if people can trust that
    it's my design and not a copy.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\n-Ria"

    of the people here who design fonts for Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic are not trilingual,
    and are doing, as Paul said above, \"more work in the forms of research and study\"
    for the alphabets for languages they don't speak.\r\nHow is my case any different?\r\nI
    don't consider it a \"waste of time\" to learn Tamil; I would like nothing more
    than to be fluent in it, but at the stage of life I'm in right now, that massive
    of a time commitment doesn't fit in with what else I want to do (mainly, design
    type).\r\nAs I also said, I will change the name to a non-loan word; you'll notice
    if you re-read my first post that I never set this name in stone.  I had originally
    considered naming this face Kallai (is that a loan word?), but decided against
    it because I read that it can have a negative connotation.\r\n\r\nMy original
    intent was to come here for critique, and after heeding said critique I planned
    to find as many native Tamil speakers as I could to look at my typeface and determine
    whether it's working the way it should (both visually and mechanically).  I of
    course will also ask for naming input from someone who speaks the language.\r\n\r\nPlease

    a calligraphic design and Gaultney has probably studied calligraphy before design

    if you want to match a Tamil to Gentium, you should study a bit Tamil calligraphy.

    economic sense perhaps, but I doubt most of us who work in Latin script would
    consider our first Cyrillic or Greek attempts very good.  It's a learning experience
    and one that's a lot longer I would think the farther removed the script is from
    our native ones.  Besides, in the end you never know who might want to buy your
