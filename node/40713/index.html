I really just want a printer that will print solid beautiful color and crisp clean text.
Photos are not a top priority.
I was looking at xerox just because it is True Adobe Postscript but Adobe Postscript has been around forever, hasn&rsquo;t that technology changed too? Is it something I still need to look for?</p>
<p>Thoughts, Ideas insights and experience all welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks for you time.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Right now you can get an amazing deal at costco.com on the Xerox Phaser 6130/N. We have a higher-end Xerox at work, and I really like it &ndash; the color is vibrant, though I have seen some color-shifting. The smaller printer may not have the same issue, and even if it does, it may be able to be fixed with calibration, but I&rsquo;m not sure. At $280 for a color laser with true PostScript 3, that price can&rsquo;t be beat. I ordered one the other day, and it should be at my door today. (It would have delivered yesterday had I been home.) I can report further after I set it up at home.</p>
<p>One cost caveat: the printer takes four toner cartridges that cost $70-80 each. On the plus side, they&rsquo;re probably good for about 5,000 prints, and you can make it so the printer only prints black when you want it to.</p>

<p>Sadly, no. The printer ships with carts rated at 1000 pages, and the standard ones are 1900 for colour and 2500 for black.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to find this info! See the bottom of page 4 here:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Update: the printer arrived today. Setup was relatively easy, and print quality seems pretty good. Not the most vibrant thing ever, but color seems accurate enough.</p>
<p>One truly stupid thing: the manual feed doesn&rsquo;t have a tray like my LaserWriter 16/600 does &ndash; it&rsquo;s just a slot. I don&rsquo;t care that much that it only does one page at a time (the LaserWriter ended up being only able to do that too, though it didn&rsquo;t start out that way), but I&rsquo;d like to be able to lay the page in the feeder and walk away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit loud when it&rsquo;s printing, but otherwise it&rsquo;s very quiet.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m looking for a good basic BW letter size laser printer with true Postscript also, and can&rsquo;t seem to get straight answer anywhere.  They all seem to say postscript emulsion, which I don&rsquo;t believe is true.  I have an old HP 6MP that&rsquo;s been a workhorse, but is show as molasiss, and strung together with all kinds of adapters so it can connect to my network.  I also have a huge color Minolta Magaicolor that prints nice tabloid sheets, but chokes on almost everything I send to it because it isn&rsquo;t true Postscript (despite what they told be when I bought it).</p>
<p>Anybody know of one for under $500? Like I said, just nee letter size and black only, but it must be true Postscript.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>cthyaka,</p>
<p>I loved HP products and use to own an HP Color Laser 11x17 printer with duplex &ndash; the dots weren&rsquo;t that sharp, but the machine really doe have artificial intelligence and if the paper is not in the tray - it knows to go to the next tray, which may not be the size - but that was alright with me. To replace all the toner at one shot &ndash; I found a place on the internet in Brooklyn and it would be under $700 - and it was good for 20,000 to 30,000 reproductions. A new drum (only one) was a few hundred each year.</p>
<p>Today I own an Okidata C9500 - also 11x17 color laser. It prints extremely sharp (even my professional printer has been overwhelmed by the printers I post - it is as good as the work they do.) It really does an excellent job - but it is not as smart as an HP. For example, should I have 5 sheets of cover stock in it, and I want to print 10 &ndash; it will print the first 5 and then start to print 6 and get rattled that it doesn&rsquo;t have the same paper weight. I have to shut it down and restart. The quality is great and I do get about 30,000 sheets before changing toner. However, every color not only has a toner - but a separate drum for each color&hellip; and the belt needs replacement every 12-18 mos. &ndash; let&rsquo;s just say it is expensive to keep it going, and my customers like the idea of the local stationery store charging 49 cents a color copy. So I&rsquo;ve advised the customers that remind me about this - they are welcome to use the other guy.</p>
<p>I also have a small HP color printer now (I thought I&rsquo;d save money on toner&hellip; not true) it gives me pretty pictures - it doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about drums - but the toners cost under $600 - and it doesn&rsquo;t last very long as it loves to print in a default of 2400 dpi, which of course uses up all the toner. I&rsquo;ve asked how to change the default, and you can&rsquo;t &ndash; you can with every job you are printing request in the software to lower it to 300 or 600 dpi - but the darn printer keeps printing in 2400 dpi. Also, I spent an additional 300 to put it on wireless - only to find out that it was a separate wireless system from the network&rsquo;s wireless&hellip; it is now hardwired into the network - saved a lot of headaches.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions - feel free&hellip; hope my first hand experiences are helpful to you. Even though you already have bought one as I just finished reading&hellip; lol</p>
