body: "Hello All,\r\n\r\nI'm vectorizing this logo for a client's banner, and I'm
  having trouble identifying the font of the \"Fightkamp\" title. I think it's similar
  to Optima, because of the way the ends flare out, but it definitely isn't, as there's
  no notch on the top of the A, and no reversing serifs on the T. I put it through
  WhatTheFont (after warping it back to look regular) and it gave me a bunch of sans-serif
  fonts. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
