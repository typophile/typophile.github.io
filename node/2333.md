  if this has been covered adequately elsewhere&#41;. Bitmap fonts in OS X break or
  misbehave. Here is a clue from <a href="http://www.pixelhaus.com/#Fonts" target="_blank">http://www.pixelhaus.com/#Fonts</a>
  <BR> <BR><i>&#34;These are &#34;bitmap&#34; fonts designed for onscreen use, such
  as website design and Flash work. Since OS X 10.3 &#40;Panther&#41; seems to break
  these fonts, <b>I&#39;ve converted them from old-style Mac OS 9 bitmap fonts to
  a True Type font &#34;shell&#34; with an embedded bitmap. In other words, they are
  not &#42;true&#42; TrueType fonts, as there are no font outlines.</b> The system
  should see them as TrueType fonts and allow their use regardless of this, although
  OS X&#39;s FontBook app does not seem to want to preview them. I realize this is
  awkward, but they are older fonts created back in the days before OS X. I&#39;ve
  yet to receive a report of these fonts causing system trouble, but as always: use
  at your own risk!&#34;</i> <BR> <BR>Emphasis mine. <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: Hi Jon,  <BR> <BR>I have heard about OS X&#39;s pixel-font hostile antics.
    If I understand, you have created outline-style TrueType pixel fonts, similar
    to those used by Flash designers, for a Mac-centric audience. <BR> <BR>If these
    bitmap fonts are immune to the OS X problem, it will confirm TrueType/OpenType
    outlines as the system-independent bitmap font medium of choice. Ironic, but great.
    <BR> <BR>FontLab&#43;FlashFonter can convert old Mac fonts into the &#39;flash
    pixel font&#39; style. How did you do it? <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;d like to try your
    e-World font on my Win2K system. Would you post the OS X TrueType in a .zip file.
    <BR>? <BR>-chris

  body: Embedding a &#34;true&#34; bitmap font into a TT shell is not enough - MacOS
    doesn&#39;t like those either. Especially not grayscale ones, which can cause
    even pre-X systems to perform a major flaming crash! Ironically, everything used
    to work seamlessly before System-8. <BR> <BR>The only way -like Chris says- is
    to make an outline font that behaves like a bitmap font at one specific size.
    These are generally called pixelfonts &#40;with some nice automation indeed provided
    by Pyrus&#41;, and the great news is they can be grayscale too &#40;blowing away
    any other font rendering method&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Jon, I erroneously assumed you were the developer. thanks for posting the
    heads up. <BR> <BR>I have seen &#39;pixelfonts&#39; working on Mac OS X. Is it
    true that these fonts have actual bitmaps embedded, not bitmap-shaped outlines?

    <BR>Christopher: no problem, my message did read like an announcement. I remain
    mystified by font behaviour on OS X. I have downloaded these fonts from pixelhaus
    but I haven&#39;t installed or tried them yet. <BR> <BR>I currently have two bitmap
    fonts on my OS X system, one which can be used and one not. I am going to compare
    them to these from pixelhaus &#40;just downloaded&#41; to see what happens. <BR>
    <BR>BTW if you require a .zip file because you can&#39;t open a .sit file <a href="http://www.stuffit.com/win/expander/index.html">here&#39;s</a>
    a utility to open .sit files on Windows. <BR> <BR>Hrant: you seem to be making
    a distinction between bitmap fonts and pixelfonts and I must confess my ignorance.
    Are you saying pixelfont==a bitmap font with no outlines in a TrueType shell?
    And &#34;true&#34; or real bitmap font is one that has no outline, nor does it
    require one to be rendered to the screen? Is that the gist of what you are saying?
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try to keep you posted. <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: '&#62; distinction between bitmap fonts and pixelfonts <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not
    like the terminology is solid, but there are three kinds of screen-optimized fonts:
    <BR>1&#41; The superhinted stuff, like the MS core fonts. These have no bitmap
    data - they have special code &#40;&#34;instructions&#34;&#41; to perform funky
    distortions to the outlines which makes them render out as nice bitmaps at each
    size. These are always 1-bit &#40;b&amp;w&#41; in practice, although: it&#39;s
    actually possible to superhint for grayscale rendering - it just seems to be too
    much work; and above certain PPEM sizes grayscaling is enabled, essentially because
    the rendering algorithm no longer needs much hand-holding. <BR>2&#41; What are
    generally called pixelfonts, which are regular outline fonts that have blocky
    forms that map to a specific pattern at a given size. These can be 1-bit &#40;b&amp;w&#41;
    or more recently grayscale. <BR>3&#41; &#34;True&#34; bitmap fonts, which contain
    actual bitmap data, either as stand-alone files &#40;like FON, or the old Mac
    NFNT stuff&#41;, or embedded in TT fonts which may or may not have outlines too.
    These can also be grayscale in theory, but it&#39;s hard to make them work on
    Windows, and since System8 MacOS has flaming-crashed if you try to use one. Sad.
    <BR> <BR>Although #3 in its embedded flavor is the most elegant &#40;not least
    because it provides a nice separation between print and screen rendering&#41;,
    it&#39;s looking like you want to avoid it, especially on the Mac &#40;although
    doing 1-bit versions for Windows is great&#42;&#41;. And even #1 is being demoted
    on the Mac since Panther seems to ignore hinting. So #2 is looking great overall
    - even if they try the OS makers will have trouble preventing it from working.

    <BR> <BR>Then there&#39;s ClearType, which is a different kettle of fish. Technically
    it&#39;s possible to apply any of the above three classes to CT &#40;except maybe
    not the grayscale flavor of #2&#41; but I&#39;ve yet to see anybody actually do
    it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Thanks Hrant. So what I have from pixelhaus is what you classify as #3 judging
    by the way that Dave at pixelhaus describes it &#40;see above&#41;. I have installed
    the McMurdo font onto my system and here&#39;s the deal: <BR> <BR>1. The system
    runs fine. <BR>2. TextEdit can use the font just fine. Omni Graffle can use it
    just fine. Both display great at 7pts. No AA. Illustrator doesn&#39;t know it
    exists. Photoshop can see it and use it. Applies AA if you want it too though
    you can say none and it displays as expected. <BR>3. FontBook can see that there&#39;s
    a font there and despite what Dave at pixelhaus indicates I <b>can</b> see a preview
    of it. <BR>4. Font Book crashes if I try to &#39;manage&#39; the font in any way
    by adding it to a font collection. The system stays okay. <BR>5. TypeTool has
    nothing to open. It doesn&#39;t crash, it just thinks it&#39;s opened everything
    there is to open, but nothing there for it. <BR> <BR>Screenshots &#40;sorry for
    the haloing&#41;: <BR>Here&#39;s TextEdit with text in McMurdo and McMurdo selected
    in the Font Panel: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22152.jpg"
