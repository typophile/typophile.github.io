  body: 'thank you guys! i was at a loss there, wondering where my post was, and saw
    in FAQ your handy policy of changing name of subject line.  <BR> <BR>that was
    sosooo fast.  <BR> <BR>if anyone knows how to find a freeware similiar option,
    that would be great too. '

  body: Sorry about making you lose track of your thread by changing  <BR>its name
    so quickly, but I used the leftover of my lunch break to  <BR>do some cleaning.
    Great to hear the FAQ page was of help. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>We don&#39;t list freeware alternatives/rip-offs,
    as we firmly believe  <BR>these practices harm the livelihood of type designers.
    You can  <BR>do some research of your own at one of the freeware/shareware  <BR>font
    sites around ; they usually have categories like <a href="http://dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=501&amp;page=1&amp;nb_ppp_old=10&amp;texte=Sterile%20sans%20serif&amp;nb_ppp=10&amp;classt=alpha&amp;Envoyer=Submit"
    target="_blank"> this one</a>. <BR>Good luck!

  body: I entirely agree, thanks for the slap on the back of my hand. That was quite
    rude of me.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just working with this small arts organisation right
    now, and grr... budgets are tight.  <BR> <BR>Back when I had money, I purchased
    an actual font. &#40;Solex&#41; for a project. I do agree with you.  <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for your help and much respect.  <BR> <BR> <BR>

    are far better than any algorithms in identifying fonts.  <BR> <BR>and from now
    on, i&#39;m going to make sure that font purchases can be included in our expenses.
    seriously! <BR> <BR>thanks guys. '
