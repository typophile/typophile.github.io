    get more responses if you use your real name as your screen name. Especially as
    a new user. It used to be somewhat of a tradition.

  body: "Chris, I prefer seeing a real name myself, but I don't think not using one
    makes a big difference on Typophile. Especially in the ID section where virtually
    nobody looks at who's asking.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
