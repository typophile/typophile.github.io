  terminal started giving me this error: \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/assertion-error_6589.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs
  far as I'm aware, I haven't changed anything, it just started happening. I tried
  a fresh install of the FDK, no luck. It yields this same error with .otf files previously
  successfully hinted and also with a the few Adobe .otf files I tried. However, using
  the FL macros works. Does anyone have any idea of what is happening here? Thanks
  for your time.\r\n\r\n--K "

  body: Not necessarily. Can you send me the font? It could be a problem with the
    autohinter, so I'd like to see if the error is reproducible on my side.
