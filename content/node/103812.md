  Day\" that looks like the Black Scale font, but it's not the same.\r\nAnd for the
  \"D M N D\", the closest I found was Roman Engraved.\r\nAny help will be appreciated.
  Thank you :)\r\n\r\n- Pat\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blackscale_3420.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IBNjasperDMND_4603.jpg]"
