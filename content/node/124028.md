body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to make some type to spell out 'backsides' for a
  student project. I'd like it to feel at home with road signs (of the speed limit
  rather than place-name variety) and as the text suggests, also backsides. The tone
  is intended to be playful. \r\n\r\nFor those who are interested, here is some non-essential
  background information: \r\n\r\n<blockquote>Backsides is a walking exhibition of
  typographic play that will open from April 31st and continue indefinitely. A parasitic
  poster posting initiative, Backsides will capitalise on the highly-visible empty
  space provided by the derri\xE8res of Britain\u2019s signage system. Initially 2
  miles in length, the exhibition will continue to grow as submissions flow in. </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  think it has rather obvious associations with Bayer's Universalschrift, but I'm
  looking for more reference points if what I've drawn calls to mind anything else.
  \r\n\r\nAs it stands, I'm not sure about my execution of the 'k', I think the counter
  of the 'e' might be a bit off and although I've done my best with it, the 's' terrifies
  me. And do you think the bits where round meets straight on my 'a', 'b' and 'd'
  need to be more pronounced? i.e. should I make the stroke of the circles thinner
  as they reach the stems?  \r\n\r\nWhy not use something off-the-shelf? I see a value
  in complete control, and typography design is a skill I would like to develop.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B.
  I've posted this here and not in the logotype section because I think that for now
  the advice here will be more appropriate.\r\n\r\n"
