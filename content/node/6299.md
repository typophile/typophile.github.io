    <BR>Jill, don&#39;t offer your soul around here - we&#39;ll take it, and send
    it to Kerning Purgatory. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    maybe the lady in <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=CHALET-FO&amp;sub=silos"

  body: Well the G is the only real clue as to an indicator. <BR> <BR>You might find
    a similar silhouette in some of  Paleale&#39;s image fonts. But isn&#39;t that
    the very same silhouette you see on all those semi-truck mud guards?

  body: yes, its the same silhouette as on mud guards, car air fresheners, etc..I
    even went to tatoo parlors in hopes to find it and can&#39;t find it anywhere.

  body: Reminds me of a face I saw in a <a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/"> FontHaus</a>
    catalogue long ago, a bit reminiscent of <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PDogB.html">
    Dogma Bold</a>, if my memory serves me well.
