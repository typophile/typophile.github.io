    for ceiling fans, but it turns out to be a holding company for a variety of firms
    largely in the food services business. \r\n\r\nI like the design of the logo,
    perhaps because it vaguely reminds of the logo I designed for my own company (reFlourish

    \r\n\r\nAnd, just as bad, I don't get your joke, David: \"The colors are not working
    for this crowd's background.;)\" I see your wink, so I assume you're being light-hearted,
    but I have no idea what you mean. It's sad I'm so out of it. Sigh.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I liked the logo even before I became aware of the negative shapes &mdash; when
    it was just a swirling design of pleasing abstract shapes and colors. \r\n\r\nThanks
    for posting it, Hrant, even if not everyone finds the logo appealing, but when
    did everyone ever agree about anything on this site? Smile. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When

  body: "According to an employee, the logo was designed by Hornell Anderson of Seattle.\r\n\r\nI
    asked what it was meant to evoke. The employee pointed out the knife-shape at
    the top right on the wheel shape, and the spoon shape in the negative space at
    the bottom. The rest of course is interpolation to get from the knife in the positive
    to the spoon in the negative space. The company services the fast food / casual
    dining industry.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing Hrant likes it for it's notan."
