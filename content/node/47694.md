  part of a major re-brand, my company is looking to adopt a relatively unique font
  family which can be used in all of our collateral. The font which has most appealed
  to us so far is Whitney and, whilst we are definitely willing to pay for the 2 licenses
  needed for our designer and server to host the font files, I've been told that,
  if we want to use the font in our distributed PDFs, we need to pay an additional
  $150 per year per font variant. These kind of figures amount to being way too much
  and i'm thinking it makes much more sense to have a custom font developed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
  though, we don't have much time available to us and using a ready-made font family
  makes much more sense.\r\n\r\nMy questions to all of you typophiles are...\r\n\r\n1.
  Will we face the same problem with all fonts or was this unique to Whitney?\r\n2.
  What solutions are available to us?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your time and input.\r\n\r\nFahed"

  body: "I'm seeing a red flag. It's the discrepancy between \"Major re-brand\", \"requisite
    2 licenses\" and \"server to host the font files\". \r\n\r\nHow many employees
    will be using the fonts to make documents? How many people will use templates,
    company forms and collateral that require the use of the fonts? Will all of them
    require the fonts themselves, or will company graphics using the fonts be converted
    to outlines? \r\n\r\nI ask all these questions because most \"major re-brands\"
    require a considerably more extensive licensing arrangement than 2 copies of the
    fonts. Hosting fonts on a server doesn't replace the necessity for all users of
    the fonts to be licensed. If 50 people throughout the company need to have access
    to the fonts to make documents, there will be many more than 2 licenses required.
    \r\n\r\nIt might be useful to ascertain all the potential uses your company would
    make of the fonts, and then get appropriate pricing for retail fonts, and compare
    that to pricing for custom fonts. Custom fonts have the advantage that nobody
    ever needs to upgrade licenses or get new licenses; the fonts can be distributed
    freely within the company that owns them. In the case of exclusive custom fonts,
    you could host them on a server and allow employees to download them at will.
    However the fonts are a more valuable asset as exclusive property, and need to
    be kept within the company. "

    Typophile.\r\n\r\nHmmm...\r\n\r\nIf you aren't absolutely desperate to get the
    fonts settled, it will probably be worthwhile to consider custom. \r\n\r\nBut
    I would have a number of questions to ask you about your needs and preferences
    before I could give any idea of turnaround. There are many variables like: how
    many styles, character set (language coverage), style, intended uses, etc. \r\n\r\nAt
    a certain point, you are likely to want a real quote from someone, and I'm not
    in a position to do the work or give a quote at all, so maybe this is the time
    for you to contact some of the [[http://typophile.com/node/20643?|independent
    foundries whose designers visit typophile.]] If you want recommendations, contact
    me offline thru my profile. \r\n\r\nOne thing to know: There is a lot of gray
    area between retail and custom type solutions for you. For instance, a designer
    might take one of their own retail releases and make custom weights or styles
    for you from their private data, thereby saving immensely in development costs.
    They might also arrange for the faces to be exclusive to you for a specific period
    such as 3 years or 10 years, after which they become retail, and a royalty stream
    takes up some of the development cost. So there are many different ways to get
    custom type that might fit your situation and budget. \r\n\r\nThe one way that
    isn't kosher is for someone to slightly scale someone else's retail face and then
    sell it to you as custom. The originating foundry is likely to pounce. Work directly
    with originating foundries to get the best work and the cleanest contracts. "

    what about Print-On-Demand (POD) systems?\r\n\r\nI work as a designer in a franchise
    company with many franchisees. We would like to have in place that would allow
    franchisees to go online and edit variable data in a print template that I created
    and provided to our POD provider. I would have a 5-user license and the POD provider
    would also have a 5-user license. Would that not be sufficient?\r\n\r\nThe foundry
    that we initially purchased our fonts from says that it also wants a license for
    every franchisee in our system, even though none of the franchisees will have
    the fonts on their machines. This seems overboard. The edits that franchisee make
    on the POD amount to changing the address and phone number on the template. Does
    that really necessitate a license for each?\r\n\r\nI am interested in the feedback
    of the Typophile community about this. Thanks for your time and attention.\r\n--\r\nAj"

  body: It is an understandable thing for some foundries to want each end user to
    have a license. It is the same thing, essentially, as a EULA which doesn't allow
    for editable embedding unless the user has a license to do so.

    as long as they have a license, everything should be fine since it is their equipment
    that is doing the editing of the final document. Let me explain, there is a layer
    between the website user (franchisee) and the template editing. The website user
    modifies text in a field on a web form, the POD providers system stores that information
    in a database which then edits a template accordingly. Essentially, this could
    be seen as similar to a franchisee emailing the POD provider the text changes
    desired and the POD provider making the change and printing it. The franchisee
    has no direct contact with the print templates other than to see a screenshot
    of what a typical template looks like.\r\n\r\nDoes this change anything?\r\n--\r\nAj"

    I modify a database of business card info on my printers website which is linked

    and question: does modifying raw data constitute typesetting? If so, does a credit
    card company or bank that uses a specific font in its statements need to purchase
    licenses or make special arrangements for thousands (maybe millions) of its customers
    who make purchases, deposts, transfers and withdrawls thereby 'typesetting' the
    statement? That may sound a bit ridiculous, but I believe that this line between

    change my address on a business card, have I now typeset something?</em>\r\n\r\nNo.
    But when your printer makes the change, he IS typesetting something. You can't
    give him the font you used to make the design (unless the font's EULA allows this).
    The printer will have to license the font himself in order to make the change.\r\n\r\n\r\n><em>#2:
    I email my printer the change I would like made on a business card, have I now
    typeset something?</em>\r\n\r\nIf you are sending him a changed business card
    layout file, then yes, you have. You are using the font you licensed, and you
    made the change on your own computer. If your font's license allows PDF Print
    & Preview embedding, then you can send that PDF to the printer, and he can print
    your business card. He's not actually using the font himself, and probably wouldn't
    need a license.\r\n\r\n\r\n><em>#3: I modify a spreadsheet of business card info
    and email the file to my printer to import into a biz card template, have I now
    typeset something?</em>\r\n\r\nHere your printer would need a font license, I
    think. Depending on whether or not you actually designed anything in the font
    on your computer, you may not even need the font file yourself to do this work!
    But the printer would.\r\n\r\n><em>#4: I modify a database of business card info
    and email the database file to my printer to update his database which is linked
    to a biz card template, have I now typeset something?</em>\r\n\r\nThe answer here
    is probably the same as number three. Your printer would probably need to license
    the font himself.\r\n\r\n><em>#5: I modify a database of business card info on
    my printers website which is linked to a biz card template, have I now typeset
    something?</em>\r\n\r\nSounds like numbers three and four to me\u2026"
