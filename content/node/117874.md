    Avante Garde Gothic's M is still on the baseline. \r\n\r\nI am going to see if
    I can pick the book up today, maybe check the colophon. \r\n\r\n*edit: Spoke too
    soon, the bowls of the 'P' and 'R' are the wrong proportion and the 'I' has feet.
    The search continues..."

  body: "With the exception of Universal Doomsday and Barq, all the options I gave
    you have an M that terminates parallel to and above the baseline (look at the
    the heavier weights, not the roman), and a G that terminates parallel to the baseline.\r\n\r\nPlatform's
    G doesn't match.\r\n\r\nHere's a larger image of the book:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/larger_6511.jpg]"

  body: "If we can't find a match, you might try to reverse engineer the font. \r\nYou
    could use Code Pro Bold, perhaps with minor adjustments, for capital letters like
    _C_,  _G_ [raise bar and top terminal], _M_, _W_. and something like Platform
    Bold for letters like _R_ [widen bowl slightly] and _P_ [ditto]. The remaining
    capital letters, with the exception of _S_ [which differs from the title] could
    be taken from either font and width adjusted to match. As for _S_, Nobel Bold
    and Benton Sans Bold seem to have a match.\r\nAs for the lower case, the letters
    are too small to make a specific suggestion, other than to note that it has a
    two story _g_ with an upper bowl that seems slightly larger than the lower bowl
    that descends only slightly below the base and is not separated from the upper
    bowl, which may have an ear at 2 p.m. Could use _s_ from Nobel or Benton Sans\r\nGlyph
    capital height of the component fonts would need to be standardized and, if the
    stroke width of the Bold is not identical, the stroke width of one or the other
    should be adjusted.\r\nMinor point, based on the umlaut, all punctuation should
    be in square format. See for example Benton Sans.\r\nDon"
