  <BR> <BR>Hi, this is my first go at a critique! My fingers are quivering as I type
  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>
  <BR> <BR>My views: I&#39;m pretty happy with it, it smells of lovely &#34;Logan&#39;s
  Run&#34;-style gleaming computing. <BR>I&#39;d like to keep it monospaced but the
  T irks me. The W is maybe going too far?  <BR> <BR>Any thoughts or advice would
  be greatly appreciated!'

  body: andrew <BR> <BR>hi, nice stuff, i like it, but some few coments. <BR> <BR>1st   the
    black rectangle in your K should have rounded corners too. <BR> <BR>2nd i dont
    understand why dont you leave your W and 4 open like you do it with your u, or
    y. the way they are seems to me too confuse. <BR> <BR>3rd you can try closing
    your K , H and N in the bottom like your A, X or M.  <BR> <BR>Nice work <BR> <BR>CG

  body: 'Hi Cristian, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the comments! <BR> <BR>1 - fair enough.
    The K looks a bit sharper than it actually is, but I agree they need to be more
    rounded anyway. <BR> <BR>2 - I can lose the W top. But I like the 4: I wanted
    something similar to the 4 in Data 70. I&#39;ll try it out though. <BR> <BR>3
    - this was a definite style decision. The broken bar gives it more of a computer/MICR
    feel. Your suggestion gives more unity, but at the loss of some of the flavour
    I was after. <BR> <BR>But hey, I&#39;ll try out your suggestions and post up some
    alternatives soon.'

    <BR>I have a hard time deciphering the 4 and the P -- they&#39;re the only characters
    where the black shape at the bottom is supposed to be read as part of the letter,
    rather than just serving as a decorative device. And I agree with Cristian&#39;s
    comments about the W -- looks like an M to me.

    <BR> <BR>Here are some revisions. I like the new symmetrical W loads better than
    the original, so thanks for encouraging me to lose the top <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>The solid bar letters are nicer than I thought
    they would be. I can use the broken bar for lowercase alternatives. <BR> <BR>Does
    opening the 4 and/or narrowing the gap help at all? <BR> <BR>The P is a bit of
    a problem area at the moment. If I gain legibility then I lose seventies future
    vision :/  Not sure what to do with it; every new idea makes it look like an R.
