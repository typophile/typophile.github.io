  body: I have a feeling that someone made this by converting Copperplate to outlines
    and changing the forms. Maybe I'm wrong.

  body: It is indeed my Lewisham, designed from scratch many years ago as one of my
    early experiements and not the least bit modified from Copperplate or anything
    from FontHead.  I also cringe at the S, and indeed a few other things now, but
    I was very inexperienced and keen at the time!  A good deal younger, alas, as
    well.....
