    is dapper, not grunge.\r\nBut I appreciate the difficulty interpreting his music
    visually; this is a c.1970 album which includes a \"straight\" live version of
    <em>My Favorite Things,</em> and an awesomely skronky freak-out on the title track.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JohnColtrane_Selflessness_3432.jpg]\r\nArtists
    dressed smartly then, to be taken seriously (eg Modern Jazz Quartet), and all
    those crazy Dada and Surrealist artists, you see the photos of them in their suits
    and ties. Conventional dress, unconventional art.\r\nNotwithstanding this agent
    of change, Sun Ra:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/260px-SunRa1960-WonderInn_5461.jpg]"

    someone be able to identify a similar font as the one in question. Thank you and
    good night...

    is similar, but it looks like it's uppercase only.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I have to agree
    with Nick. Was just looking at a couple of his Blue Note releases today. Love
    the typography and design on those."

  body: BTW Nancy, next time you may want to post such threads to the [[http://typophile.com/typeid|Type
    ID Board]], the Typophile forum dedicated to these sorts of requests. I suspect
    there would then be a bit less digression. Maybe.

    in the general discussion pool as thats where all the cool kids hang out....
