body: "Hi\r\n\r\nIs it possible to compare the side-bearings of two separate fonts
  and mark any differences.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to do it with a macro. I can
  open the two fonts but how do I loop through the glyphs of the fonts. It would be
  nice it it skips any glyphs that aren't present in both fonts as well.\r\n\r\n<CODE>\r\nfrom
  robofab.world import OpenFont\r\nfontOne = OpenFont(None)\r\nfontTwo = OpenFont(None)\r\nprint
  fontOne.info.fullName,\"/\",fontTwo.info.fullName\r\nprint \" \"\r\nfor g in fontOne:\r\n\tif
  fontOne[g].leftMargin != fontTwo[g].leftMargin or fontOne[g].rightMargin != fontTwo[g].rightMargin:\r\n\t

  body: "You just have some syntax issues, mostly. \r\n- just 'cause Python is loosely
    typed doesn't mean you can ignore variable type. In order to print the left margin,
    which is an integer, you need to cast it as a string. \r\n- In order to specify
    a glyph, you need to pass it the glyph name, not the glyph itself, like:  font[glyphname\"]\r\n-
    to add things to a print line, use the plus sign, not comma.\r\n\r\nSo try this:\r\n\r\nfrom
    robofab.world import OpenFont\r\nfontOne = OpenFont(None)\r\nfontTwo = OpenFont(None)\r\nprint
    fontOne.info.postscriptFullName + \" / \" + fontTwo.info.postscriptFullName\r\nprint
    \" \"\r\nfor g in fontOne:\r\n    if fontOne[g.name].leftMargin != fontTwo[g.name].leftMargin
    or fontOne[g.name].rightMargin != fontTwo[g.name].rightMargin:\r\n        print
    str(fontOne[g.name].leftMargin) + \"-\" + g.name + \"-\" + str(fontOne[g.name].rightMargin)\r\n
    \       print str(fontTwo[g.name].leftMargin) + \"-\" + g.name + \"-\" + str(fontTwo[g.name].rightMargin)\r\n
    \       print str(fontOne[g.name].leftMargin - fontTwo[g.name].leftMargin) + \"----\"
    + str(fontOne[g.name].rightMargin - fontTwo[g.name].rightMargin)\r\n        print
    \"------------------\"\r\n        print \" \"\r\n        fontOne[g.name].mark
    += 10"

  body: "Thanks for that jasonc\r\n\r\nIt starts to work but then stops with no error
    output. I think it might be because the fonts might have slightly different glyphs
    included.\r\n\r\nThey are both variants of the same font but one has been updated
    slightly and I wanted to make sure the spacing hand't been changed.\r\n\r\nIs
    there a log i can check to see why it stops?"

  body: "Really? IN my testing it works when the glyph sets are not the same, it simply
    reports zeros for both sidebearings. Not an elegant solution but it works. \r\n\r\nDid
    you adjust the indents before running it? Typophile edits out the indents, so
    you need to do that in order for it to work\r\n"

  body: "Yes I replaced the indents.\r\n\r\nIt starts so I'm assuming it works but
    then stops.\r\n\r\nIs there a log somewhere I could check?"

  body: 'Not really. You can try adding print statements at different places so you
    can see where it''s at. If you''re not seeing any print lines, then you know it''s
    stuck at the beginning, of course. '
