  body: 'Hi Kevin ...the things that stand out at first glance: <BR> <BR>&#42; the
    GH connector seems to makes that letter pair too heavy <BR>and unbalanced, imo.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; the T appears standing on tiptoe. It feels like it should <BR>extend
    lower. <BR> <BR>&#42; the S looks a little bit leaning forward. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    having a Ghostface treatment and right under it <BR>Ghostface plain seems a bit
    jarring &#40;but I see that <BR>it&#39;s necessary&#41;. <BR> <BR>can we see the
    rest of the ad? or know how it&#39;s being used? <BR> <BR>bj'

  body: What if the -ghost silhouette- was lightened up? Too much? I agree with you,
    BJ, about the -GH- appearing too heavy.

  body: the &#39;t&#39; bothers me the most. i&#39;d really like to see that go lower.
    <BR>but i like the black sillhouette better. maybe add eyes to it?

  body: Seeing it in context I retract my idea about screening the ghost out. Can
    you add space in between the -GH- combination? The -T- does seem to sit too high.
