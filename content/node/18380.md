  things happen. During my scouting, I came across <ahref=\"http://drawbot.com/\">Drawbot</a>,
  \"an ideal tool to teach the basics of programming.\" Sounds like me! However, it
  refuses to work on my machine (10.4.5) and before I spend more time figuring out
  why, I would like to know if anyone here has found it useful\u2014especially in
  regards to learning Python for typeface produciton. \r\n\r\nCheers! \r\n\r\n\u2014K"

    target=\"_blank\">Petr van Blokland</a> in my undergrad course and now with <a
    href=\"http://www.letterror.com\" target=\"_blank\">Just van Rossum and Erik van
    Blokland</a> in the postgrad, I can only say Drawbot is one of the funnest ways
    imaginable to learn something as dull as a programming language: With incredible
    little knowledge you can at least do some funny patterns and through programming
    these learn using dicts, lists and tuples, for-a-in-x-loops and if-then-loops,
    objectifying your programming into methods and classes etc etc. \r\n\r\nnice book:
    David Beazley, Python Essential Reference, Riders Press\r\n\r\nHave fun with Drawbot,
    and holler if you can't get it to work.\r\n\r\nkai"
