  several people came up to me and asked what they could do to help me finish the
  film.\r\n\r\nI have decided to set up this somewhat unusual fund raising method
  to help with the finishing of the film. It is asking for donations but those donations
  are basically pre-ording things that could be bought in the future anyway.\r\n\r\nhttp://kck.st/aTulSg\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your consideration"
