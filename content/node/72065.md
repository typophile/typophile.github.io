  [[http://typophile.com/node/62266|this thread]], but that thread is already marked
  as solved and I'd imagine unlikely to get attention (again, if this is not grounds
  for a new thread, I apologise).\r\n\r\nMy question is in regards to the variety
  of Knockout used in [[http://www.elephantmag.com/magazine/allissues|Elephant Magazine]].
  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/farrow_5825.png]\r\n\r\nIt appears to
  be a rounded version. Does anyone know if this is available somewhere?\r\n\r\nIf
  not, any suggestions for an another strong (rounded) condensed headline typeface?\r\n\r\n"

    not condensed enough for your needs?

    just decided he no longer wanted it on the market.\r\n\r\nAtwe: Garage Gothic
    is a nice alternative. Not as versatile as Knockout (with its many widths and
    weights), but good to have nonetheless.\r\n\r\nStill the mystery remains though...
    where can this rounded Knockout be found? \r\n\r\nIs it likely that the designers
    at Elephant magazine have modified it themselves? or would they more likely have
    commissioned H&FJ to do the modifications?"
