  body: "<em>Prove your type-geekness</em>\r\n\r\nNo proof necessary, but glad to
    oblige:\r\n\r\nI've seen that trick with reversing the stress of one letter in
    A, V, and W combinations before.\r\nThere's a LAWYER sign in Bracebridge that
    has it.\r\nHowever, in this case I don't think the artist was addressing the issue
    of uneven color in specific letter combinations, but rather, as is attested by
    the treatment of \"USA\", was laboring under the delusion that the \"stress premise\"
    of capitals should follow that of the first letter A, misinterpreted as \"left
    stroke thin, right stroke thick\". Clearly, this work exhibits a lack of understanding
    of the chirographic principle that underlines contrast in Latin capitals (upstoke
    thin, downstroke thick)--but that's what makes vernacular cute, ennit?\r\n"

  body: "Ooh. (:\r\nI don't know, there is other lettering I find much more \"sad
    and depressing\", namely, the sort that shows there was no time, or thought, or
    love put into it at all. This here took time, and it took love, and thought, by
    somebody who knows nothing about letterforms, stress, or anything, but tried so
    hard to reproduce 'beautiful' forms. That makes it hugely cute, and likeable,
    in my eyes. Plus, I'm a big fan of that shy little question mark!\r\n\r\nGeekness
    \u2026 I'm just imagining coming across this with a bunch of non-typophile friends.
    They could probably go shopping, have a coffee, and debate about going to see
    a movie before they'd drag me away from that, eyes rolling. (: "

    choice of direction for the drop shadow, an x-height that couldn't be much taller

    it isn't professional and is sometimes charming \u2013 it certainly isn't worth
