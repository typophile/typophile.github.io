body: "Hello (:\r\n\r\nI'm currently undergoing research into the form and function
  of typography. The research and investigation will go towards a final paper that
  develops on the ideas researched.\r\n\r\nIn investigating my hypothesis, <strong>'In
  contemporary society the funtion of type is more important than its form,'</strong>
  I hope to come to some conclusion, or, develop a better understanding of the relationship
  between form and funtion, in regards to typography in contemporary society.\r\n\r\nI
  thought that perhaps some of the members of Typophile would be interested in discussing
  this. Any opinions, or discussion would be very muchly appreciated.\r\n\r\n:>"

    that means it's form IS it's function, and you can't, in my hunble opinion, try
    to let one of these terms outweigh the other.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Obviously a specific graphic communication need can dictate the form of the
    typeface some company commissions from a certain Type Designer. In this case form
    follows function. An example you have \"classic\" typefaces such as Frutiger among
    tons of other examples all over signage, corporate identities, etc.\r\nHowever
    the opposite, where the form of a typeface dictates its usability also happens
    a lot, if not more often since most of the typefaces are available to a global
    market."

    give you some thoughts, the form-follows-function argument is hardly new though,

  body: "Yes of course, in the process of type design one can either develop the most
    appropriate from for a given purpose, or decide to follow a formal approach, which
    will determine it's functionality and usage later on nonetheless. My conclusion
    from that is that you can't simply let form play against function and determine
    which is more \u201Cimportant\u201D since both   are in a relationship so close
    and complex that you can't objectively isolate one from the other."

  body: "You can throw marketing into the mix as well.  Function can be defined more
    broadly than readability and reproducibility in a given environment. The type
    must function for the market it is used in as well. Function is quite fuzzy here
    since a publisher, designer, or art director will base function on their own experience.
    \ The question becomes, will this typeface and this layout (the 2 cannot be separated)sell
    the product or communicate the proper tone for this message better than some other
    combination? Here the form plays a role in the function. Does an elegant script
    do a better job of selling perfume than a more readable book face? Would a health
    report lose credibility set in Comic Sans?  To me form and function are joined
    at the hip.  You can see them as entities but you cannot remove them from each-other.
    \ While function may appear to be the more rational of the two, measuring it relies
    on the form to begin with.  The rationale for the form may follow the rationale
    for the function but there is far more human interpretation involved than can
    be defined scientifically.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    JetSet and Designer's Republic have used Helvetica because it is common, not for
    any formal reasons. (This is significantly different than classical Swiss modernism,
    where the important values are horizontal scale, weight, and slant, not typeface,
    which just gets in the way of those other \"21 Univers styles\" considerations.)\r\n\r\nNon-professional
    users stick with the font defaults in their software, to the same effect as ESJ
    etc.\r\n\r\nIn the modern art community, especially the UK, aesthetics is derogated
    by artists who are primarily conceptual, so Ariel is the type of choice, again
    a \"no-choice\" decision.\r\n"

  body: "<em>\u2018In contemporary society the funtion of type is more important than
    its form'</em>\r\n\r\nWhy 'in contemporary society'? Are you positing that in
    earlier society the form of type was more important than the function, or that
    form and function were equally important, and that there has been a recent shift?\r\n\r\nIf
    there has been a shift, I think you could make a good argument, from within contemporary
    graphic design culture, that the opposite is true: that the form of type is treated
    by many designers as more important than its function. One has only to look through
    the pages of so-called typography annuals to see evidence of this, of type used
    primarily as a graphic element not as a medium of language and textual content."

    Arial have become hip again since people wanted things to look somewhat \u201Cundesigned\u201D
    (rebellion and all that:-), and that clearly is a formal decision. Which might
    prove being \u201Cfunctional\u201D as well since it appeals to a hip target audience.\r\nThe
    point i am making is you can't produce something visual and pretend aesthetics
    and form wouldn't play a role, whatever way you're going, it is visual, it is
    physical, so it necessarily does have a form. "

  body: "To make myself clearer, being \u201Ccommon\u201D is a connotation (even a
    formal one!) of Helvetica and Arial, and both are typefaces that can only be identified
    by their form \u2013 a typeface doesn't have anything else but it's form to identify
    itself among the probably unlimited number of variants of the latin alphabet.
    \r\nHaving that said, i dare say that the choice to use Helvetica, Arial, etc.
    by designers like DR and EJS is even more driven by formal aspects than say choosing
    between Garamond or Bembo for a novel."

  body: "Norman Dexel (non v\xE9rifi\xE9) | 09/06/06 |  emigre 65 \"Helvetica again\":\r\n\r\nWhy
    do you use Helvetica ?\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why we use Helvetica. Each
    is very different and sometimes seemingly contradictory, and they slowly but constantly
    change. Some of these reasons may be hard to follow, but we like to believe that
    it is exactly the complicated nature of our reasoning that, paradoxically, makes
    our designs so practical and clear.\r\nOne of these reasons involves Helvetica\u2019s
    neutrality. Of course, we fully realize that no typeface is neutral, and that
    Helvetica\u2019s objectivity is a myth. But it is exactly this myth that turned
    Helvetica into one of the most widely used typefaces in the first place. So it
    is fair to speak of a myth that created its own reality. In that sense, Helvetica\u2019s
    neutrality resembles a self-fulfilling prophecy. This neutrality, real or imagined,
    enables us and the user to fully focus on the design as a whole, neutralizing
    the typographic layer as a way to keep the concept as clear and pure as possible.
    There are cases, however, where for specific reasons, the concept demands a less
    neutral typographic layer. In those cases we never hesitate to use other typefaces.
    But those cases are rare"

  body: "The difficulty is the definitions of the two. \"Function\" does not follow
    the same definition to many people.  It's definition may be a moving target.  There
    are those who define it along the lines of readability alone. Some would add usability
    (does it have a selection of weights, small caps, OSF, etc.) There are others
    who take a far broader meaning from it and may even include human emotional reaction.
    \ There is nothing tidy about this interaction of terms.  There is more argument
    about semantics than some people allow.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
