  body: Thank you Ignacio. Aggie was the closest we&#39;ve found here too, but the
    R is significantly different and the client is going to be using it heavily so
    we can&#39;t swap it out <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Thanks for the tipoff Yves - the site is still
    down but Myfonts had about 40 of Ray&#39;s old LarabieFonts styles. No match there
    yet though.

  body: I think Ignacio was right, David -- I can&#39;t spot any differences in the
    underlying letterforms between the sample and Aggie &#40;the R looks identical
    to me, and look at that distinctive lowercase f, which is also identical&#41;.
    It looks to me like someone took Aggie and added a stroke or used Fontographer
    to make a faux-bold. The &#39;i&#39;, &#39;j&#39; and &#39;s&#39; especially bear
    the scars of indiscriminate stroke-widening.

  body: Then I guess I&#39;m going to go on a deleting spree through the studio&#39;s
    font folders as I think this is classified as a dodgy ripoff font! <BR> <BR>Many
    thanks to all! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/52162.gif"
