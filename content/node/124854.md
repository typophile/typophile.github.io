  font family I've taken and modified some of the characters and created a series
  of custom glyphs and ligitures for a new brand for a client my question is does
  my client need to now buy and license the original font in order to use the new
  modified font?\r\nThanks for any advice"

    modifications. \r\nIt\u2019s best to discuss this with the foundry and negotiate
    a deal for this new custom font. \r\n\r\nIn general and assuming a modification
    would be allowed in the EULA: Yes, the client also needs to buy a license. "

    any legal hassle:\r\n\r\n1. Print the glyphs you need for the logo.\r\n2. Scan.\r\n3.
    Trace them in Illustrator or any other vector based app.\r\n4. Do what you want.\r\n5.
    Sell to client.\r\n\r\nIn the rest of the world the issue is somewhat clouded.
    Contact the typedesigner and talk about it."
