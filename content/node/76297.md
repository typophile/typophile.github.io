  it was named Androlis, but I'm not seeing it in any of my searches. I'm pretty sure
  it starts with an \"A\". \r\n\r\nThanks in advance! \r\nBezer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/e_logo3_5381.jpg]"

  body: OK, I just figured out my mistake. Surprisingly, Google didn't pick up on
    my spelling error. Its Andralis. Not Androlis.
