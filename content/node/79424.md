  help me out. I am really wanting to find this script in. I was thinking it was Bickham
  Pro but there are a few differences. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cashmere_6120.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
  you want to participate in the bonus round, you can also ID the \"Lord & Taylor\"
  too. :)"

    Script</a> is about the closest I can find to this. I suspect it was custom drawn
    for them.\r\n\r\nLORD & TAYLOR is probably also custom, but Times or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-fenice/\">Fenice</a>
    are both pretty similar from the detail available in this image.\r\n\r\n- Mike
