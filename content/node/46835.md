  having a hard time committing to this one-- it's ALMOST working, but I'm interested

  body: "Well, the qualities I like with this font are tall, elongated, crisp + open,
    and I think it's the shadow that's giving me trouble, even though I like it too.
    When small on screen, it doesn't read, and in fact looks a little corrupted.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I always knew that one as Agency Open. Since we know not what your layout
    is - one thing I can see is that this face is "weak." Perhaps it can work for
    you in the bold - that has more body to it... just a thought. Thank you.

  body: "Thanks, Jackie- I think you're right about it being Agency Open, though it's
    showing up in my library as AgencyGothic Plain. \r\nAt any rate, here is the context
    (the version with Agency is third from the left; all are still in the \"puttering
    around\" phase.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/first_love_4298.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nit's
    for a wedding photographer's website. Her style is cute and a little quirky, but
    also sophisticated and cosmopolitan.\r\n"

  body: "Missy - the Agency, IMHO, does not do the \"cute, quirky but cosmo\" kind
    of a look for you. I think your first \"comes\" (is that Caledonia?) would look
    nice replacing the Agency in the third sample (going left to right that is...)\r\n\r\nJust
    me... "

  body: "HA!\r\nI know- I noticed how PRONOUNCED that word was when I returned to
    my desk after lunch, and I was like, \"WHOOPS!\" That's kind of the problem with
    that font- it got to that point because it only looks good big (when it's smaller,
    it contorts and degrades on screen thanks in part to the shadow, methinks. Thanks
    so much for the feedback, all- when I have it a little more nailed down I'll come
    back for a full critique (yes, I know, there were about 50 more double-entendres
    in this paragraph. Get back to work, you perverts!)"

  body: I'm with you Tiffany - I didn't see it that way at all! Maybe its the romanticist
    in me - I was paying attention to the fact its for a wedding photographer -- not
    a gangbang photographer - big difference :-)

    isn't the largest and most prominent of the three, I think.
