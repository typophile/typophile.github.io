  body: '"Johnston" (an ABC/ABC Studios logo font), is finally appearing to be SoftMaker''s
    exclusive typeface design in all 4 styles - Regular, Bold, Black & Poster Black
    - under license from URW++; and yet, "P850 Sans" (Pump clone, numbered from Pumpkin
    Bold, and in the design of FontBank''s Punctuate & Southern Software''s Celesti
    Display SSi/SSK, and with more symbols/punctuation and international characters
    were added, joining numbers and some symbols/punctuation), and another font, "R790
    Sans" is coming in 5 styles instead of only 4, just like "Dessau" in the part
    of "regular", appearing to be as a clone of ITC Bauhaus; and another font, "Bilbao
    Black" (Blippo Black clone) is appearing to be in 3 styles - Regular, Poster,
    and Stencil - under license from URW++; according to Martin Kotulla, these fonts
    are finally appearing on "MegaFont XXL 3.0" (for home users) and "infiniType 4"
    (for designers), both being released around May 27, 2014.'
