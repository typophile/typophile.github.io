  and we all use lots of shortcuts as well. Some of them are universal but, there
  are some shortcuts which are not their in the list of \"Fontlab official shortcuts\"
  and we discover them while working. \r\n\r\nI would like you guys to share those
  secret shortcuts which you think others might don't know. \r\n\r\nJust one shortcut
  per Typophile would be enough.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\nThank you so much,\r\nSatya "

  body: "Here are some I use a lot (I use the Mac version, so for Windows opt = alt;
    command = ctrl):\r\n\r\nDouble-click on a node to change it from smooth to sharp
    or sharp to smooth.\r\n\r\nHold down the shift key while moving anything with
    the arrow keys to move 10 em units at a time (you can change the amount in Preferences).
    This works in the metrics window, too, with kerning.\r\n\r\nRight-click on a \"neighbor\"
    to choose a different \"neighbor\".\r\n\r\nHit the 1, 3, 5, or 6 keys to switch
    to the arrow, knife, corner point, or curve point tools respectively. (There are
    others, too, but these I use most often.) Opt-4 selects the measurement tool.
    (I think I am going to change this.)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of changing short cuts (which
    you can easily do)... I often switch to 100% zoom in the glyph window, but I didn't
    like the short cut (command-5) so I changed it to command-1, which is the same
    as a lot of other programs I use.\r\n\r\nIt's been mentioned, but I also really
    like using the tilde key to get a quick preview of the glyph I'm working on.\r\n\r\nDouble-clicking
    on a glyph in the metrics or preview window will open the glyph window for that
    glyph.\r\n\r\nIf you've got a lot of windows open, the Fonts palette gives you
    a handy list of all windows in outline form, and you can jump to a specific window
    by double-clicking on it in the list.\r\n\r\nI think this is Mac-only: In the
    font window, you can command-click on the the little icon next to the window title
    to see the path to the current open font file as a pop-up menu. If you select
    one of the locations in the menu, it will appear in the Finder. (This works with
    most other programs, too, not just FontLab, but I use it fairly often in FontLab,
    usually after opening a font from the recent files listed in its File menu.)"

  body: "Sigh. All shortcuts should be documented in the manual or in the 'help' section,
    or both. \r\n\r\nOne I use constantly is holding down + which changes the tool
    to a magnifier in the glyph window. Then dragging the mouse, button down, you
    can zoom in on one part of the character. If you let go of the + first, before
    the mouse button, the tool goes back to the arrow. If you let up the mouse first,
    then it stays on magnification. This is not documented anywhere. \r\n\r\nControl-0
    restores the glyph to 'fit' in the window, when you want to look at the whole
    glyph. "
