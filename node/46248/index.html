  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>My favorite font to use is one called Edda. I came across this specific font while designing a logo for one of my old bands, The Royal We. Although I&rsquo;ve rarely seen this particular font used, I think that it&rsquo;s fluid movement and interesting design characteristics are very appealing to the eye and it is very attention grabbing. Since the moment I first used the font, it has become a favorite of mine whenever designing something creative with text.</p>
<p>Growing up in New Orleans, I think that text has played a very important role in the way I visualize certain things. When I thing of places like Magazine or Oak street I thing of the old blue and white box lettering that label the street corners. It always amazed me that people actually took the time with each of those individual tiles to create something so beautiful, reminding me that at one point someone actually cared about something.</p>
<p>Another important thing about New Orleans is it&rsquo;s restraunts. They take up every corner of every block, of every neighborhood. A person can easily tell by the type used in their logo design what type of place it is as far as atmosphere and what type of food they might serve. These are the things that grab my attention and make want to further investigate what lies behind the logo.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with you Louie about the type of font that is used for restaurants do tell you exactly how classy they are and what the price range would be. Font and design in general is a big part of the New Orleans culture, so I can understand why you are big on design as well as text. Is this the reason you chose to be a graphic designer?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;ve always loved to create things. Ever since I was a kid, I tore apart my mother&rsquo;s house making rediculous concotions of &ldquo;art&rdquo;. To save the house from complete annihilation, my mom put me in art lessons as a kid which kept me occupied. Throughout high school, the only A&rsquo;s I received were in art&hellip;.I was really into sketches, photography, and what nots.
Although I&rsquo;ve always remained a creator in some, more tangible mediums, I&rsquo;ve actually developed an affinity for design on the computer. Learning about type and how it can be used just gives you a greater vocabulary in the world of creating things that grab people&rsquo;s attention.</div>
