  body: "Newspaper nameplate?\r\nThese were usually hand lettered.\r\nSome have been
    converted into digital fonts for private use. such as the New York Times font
    based on its historic letterhead.\r\nFoundries did produce some common styles
    for use by newspapers, but I don't recall seeing this particular blackletter.\r\nThere
    are a huge number of blackletter fonts only a few of which are digitized.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree with the description by Dino dos Santos of _Voz Gotica_ as an exquisite
    blackletter font, very calligraphic yet modular. He is a very versatile and productive
    font designer, but since producing Voz Gotica five years ago has not released
    -- as far as I know -- any more fonts in this genre, except for Hades, a \"dark
    contemporary blackletter\" and Albo, a 16th century derived lowercase, enveloped
    in a flood of calligraphic swirls.\r\nI wonder if there are any more capital letters
    available for viewing other than the ones now on the DST website.\r\nDon"

  body: "Attempting to visualize the letters not shown, I note that that bottom swash
    on _A_, _B_, _D_, _F_, _M_, _P_, and _S_ resembles the one used on Fette Gotisch.
    The twin diagonal on _S_ resembles the one used in Wedding Text MT & Wedding HiH.\r\nDon\r\n"
