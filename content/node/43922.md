  body: "The bowls of the b, d, p, and q seem a little uneven and perhaps unbalanced
    in spots. In the q it seems to be sagging to the bottom a little. The descender
    of the g seems to have a sharper curve in the upper left than it does anywhere
    else, and flattens out along the right. My eyes also want to see the stem not
    flow directly into the arches on the top of the m and n (also ear of r, bottom
    of u), but raise up like where p, q and d attach to the bowls. In these same instances,
    it seems as if those curves a re a little unbalanced, and the arches/ears/bowls
    become too gradual as they approach the stems.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to judge the typesetting
    without caps to reference the proportions."

  body: Nice and clean, but to light for a regular. I would do some modulation of
    the stroke widths, the rhythm is suffering from the monolinear stroke. Further
    the space character is way too wide, and the inter-character spacing is way too
    tight.
