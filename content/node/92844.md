body: "A post by Maxim in another thread* has got me thinking: should smallcaps -and
  maybe even the full caps- in Cyrillic be taller than in Latin? Since the lc looks
  very cap-like. Wouldn't such a variance make sense even within one font that supports
  both Cyrillic and Latin? And if you make them taller, should you also make them
  narrower?\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/92747#comment-509067\r\n\r\nI'm naturally
  inclined to vary as much as possible between scripts, and this is yet another reason
  it makes sense, so I'm curious how people who'd rather see consistency between scripts
  would counter this.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Hmm, I'm racking my brains trying to remember which typeface does exactly
    that. I thought it odd when I saw Cyrillic small caps a different size to the
    Latin ones. Haven't seen the full size caps done differently though. Interesting
    question, consistency isn't the same as conformity...

    named Laterica. Not sure what the conclusion was, though...
