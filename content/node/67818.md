  body: "I don't bother. If it's an email, which is easy to reply to, I might respond,
    \"Thank you for the opportunity to apply/interview.\" My Creative Director is
    in the habit of emailing people who've sent in their resum\xE9s and telling them
    what was wrong with it that they didn't get an interview (usually typos and such).
    She said none of them had ever responded, but she seems to have wanted something
    from them. Not sure what as it can be an awkward situation. Perhaps a simple thank
    you for the warning would have appeased her but I doubt they were feeling grateful."

  body: "Given how rare it is for anyone in the design field to send a rejection letter
    I think it might be worthwhile. Don\u2019t beg or ask why didn\u2019t get hired,
    just slip a business card into a nice thank-you note so they know you\u2019re
    not holding a grudge should they need someone later.\r\n\r\nBut only if they actually
    rejected you after an interview. if they rejected your resume it\u2019s probably
    all automated anyway."

    being told anything.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd respond with a \"Thanks for the update and
    opportunity to meet with you.\" type response. "

  body: Its for an internship, if that makes any difference.  Would it make any sense
    to ask them to reconsider ever?

    They\u2019ve already hired someone else before they get around to turning you
    down. Worse, you might be interpreted as a mental/unstable/stalker type, which
    is not something you want going around in the professional community."

  body: I generally respond to people to send mailers or drop off a resume/business
    card just because I know that most places don't and it can be really frustrating
    and annoying. That being said, I don't expect a response back and it can be annoying
    when someone repeatedly writes after it was clear there was no further need to
    do so.

  body: "A polite \"thank you for letting me know\" is acceptable. Professionalism
    is key. You never know if/when you might run into them again. It's a small community.\r\nIf
    you do ask what you did wrong, be concise and don't expect an response."

  body: "Also, it is quite possible that you did nothing wrong at all. Someone else
    was just a better fit. \r\n\r\nI've applied to many jobs where I left the interview
    knowing that I nailed it, and did everything perfectly. The only question then
    is whether the next person interviewed, or the one before, did a better job. Sometimes
    yes, sometimes no.\r\n\r\nAsking why you didn't get the job can be touchy. You
    are pretty much questioning the judgment of the hiring team. I would only do so
    if I personally knew someone on the interview team."
