  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everybody,

While working on the numerals of Sensa I realised my weak spot (sketching) is really becoming a problem now. Untill now I have always just made a few poor sketches when an idea came to mind, and did the rest on the computer. So basically I'm trying to teach myself how to sketch, but it's not really working. Is it just a matter op practise or are there certain things I need to know. Any tips, links or anything else is much appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Jasper de Waard</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It partly depends what sort of information your sketch is for. If the sketches are just for you then try not to worry about what other people would think of them. Sometimes if a sketch isn't quite right a few annotations will fix it better than trying to redraw it. Obviously, looking other people's drawings can help you find a method that works for you. Have a look at Gerrit Noordzij’s sketching technique, shown [[http://cdn.myfonts.net/s/ec/cc-200911/sketches.jpg|here]] as used by Hubert Jocham in these examples from his MyFonts Creative Characters interview from November 2009.

		<div class="commentbody">Try drawing your first letter without any guide lines, then rule your lines from that one for the others. Also, similar to what I said earlier, don't worry too much about your sketch not looking like a perfectly inked rendering. If your initial letters aren't quite to scale you can scan the drawing and manipulate them on screen; do slightly enlarged and reduced photocopies and collage those; do your second drawing on tracing paper over the first. Tracing paper is great for drawing letters because you can work on both sides.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When I was on my foundation course, the tutors said at the beginning that your sketchbook was for you only: it didn't matter how good it looked or anything. Then at the end of the course, we had to get our portfolios together for degree applications, and the tutors said my sketchbook looked rubbish, and needed to be smartened up. That was a bit mean of them, but I think the lesson learned is that anything you show to someone else should look great. Design of a sketchbook is just as sophisticated and "manipulative" as design of a logo.
Nowadays I have a moleskine notebook, where I put everything from shopping lists to font sketches, and I never show it to anyone; it's mine!</div>
