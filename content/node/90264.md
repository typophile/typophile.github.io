    the former, they were dot-matrix printers*,\r\nand I suspect the same was true
    for earlier computers.\r\nAlthough the very first ones were probably mechanical\r\ntypewriters
    \"hotwired\" to work with computers...\r\n\r\n* I had a Star 1080.  :-)\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of fonts, the main choice one had (for low-end\r\nprinters) was wide (\"10
    pitch\" = 10 characters per inch)\r\nversus narrow (\"12 pitch\") often called
    \"Elite\", maybe\r\nbecause they looked classier (narrow = classy). These\r\nwere
    sans designs with visible gaps between the dots.\r\n\r\nSpeed: If memory serves
    the bidirectional models printed\r\nat about 1 second per line, so maybe around
    a minute for\r\na full page. Just a rough estimate.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Epson MX-80 9-pin printer from the mid 80s.\r\n\r\nI wasted much of my youth creating
    fonts using a package called GEAP on the TRS-80 to try to print blackletter on
    that particular dot matrix printer.\r\n\r\nCheck out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printer

    and I made Armenian and Arabic fonts for our\r\nStar 1080 (using our C64 :-).
    BTW, you know what we used\r\nto call the TRS-80, right?  ;->\r\n\r\nBTW, you're
