body: DO NOT GO TO "5 Star Printing" in NYC. West 26st. They are running a con game.
  The paper stock they use is the thinnest I've ever seen. They do not use printing
  101 quark express to cut the paper so that the edges are white from mis cutting
  and the sizes are all off. They give you a "proof" card that looks completely different
  then the actual order. It's a total fly by night, con artist place that should be
  out of business. Stay away!
