body: Just wondering if anyone knows of forums similar to this one but for web design
  or UI design.  And what I mean by similar to this one is, a forum with significantly
  talented professionals.

  body: I&#39;m looking for something that focuses more on the design side of things
    rather than the technology &#40;even though with flash and css there is a lot
    of overlap&#41;. <BR> <BR>The thing I love about the typophile forum is that there
    are a lot of well versed pros that I could have access to. <BR> <BR>I know of
    folks like Joshua Davis and the like in the web design world, but I&#39;d like
    to know of other heros in this space.  As well as be able to interact with them
    in a forum. <BR> <BR>Any such beast out there? <BR> <BR>Sativo

  body: the aforementioned !yayhooray! is home to many who once dwelt among the greys
    of Joshua Davis&#39;s now defunct dreamless board... <BR> <BR>you&#39;ll have
    to wade through the chaos to find the gems, but if you stick to projects&amp;design
    or technology, the signal to noise ratio is considerably higher.
