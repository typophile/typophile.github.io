body: So, our primary image guy for our company was starting to use this Font for
  our game. However, he went into the hospital for some emergency surgery and will
  likely be in ICU for a month yet. Since his files are on an External HD and his
  computer is in a different country than any of us, we need to ID this font so we
  can continue work. Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_6478.png]
