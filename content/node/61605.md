  I'm leaving on 19 September to do my MATD, and just wondering if anyone is looking
  for a roommate as I still don't have a place booked. I hope this doesn't constitute
  abuse of the Typophile forums but it's the only one I can think of. I've checked
  gumtree, easyroommate, and places mentioned here in the archives, but it would be
  best to stay with another MATD student, with whom I could do end-of-day crits and
  such.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nSteve"
