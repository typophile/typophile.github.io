  a serif face, but not a must. Support for finnish and swedish is a must, as well
  as cyrillic (russian).\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKai "

  body: "What is it for? A book? Does it have to be a space saving typeface?\r\nDo
    you want to stay in the same area? humanist, venetian e?\r\n\r\nWith big typographical
    contrast a lot of typefaces would work, I mean contrast like light/bold, condensed/broad,
    colour, white space.\r\nFor textfaces you could start looking in the humanist
    department \u2013 how about Quadraat, or Tisa?\r\nOr check out this fontlist for
    suitable typefaces: http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/applications/book_text_recommended_alternatives/"

  body: "Thank you for your response, good points.\r\n\r\nThe project is an annual
    report for our client whose corporate typeface Dax is. So, we're looking for alternate
    type for body text. It might get used in the future as well on other projects.
    So, space saving is nice to have, as there's always problems with space when doing
    annual reports (especially when doing 4 different language editions of it). Lining
    figures aren't needed, we'll probably use Dax for tables and numbers. Cyrillic
    however is.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for something vaguely modern looking typeface (ie.
    something more modern than Garamond). I'm liking what Tisa looks like, so something
    in that vein.\r\n\r\nI'll give that list a look."
