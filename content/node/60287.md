  regarding the state of affairs and algorithms used for automatic (TTF) glyph hinting
  ?\r\n\r\nIt might be somewhat ignorant thought, but it seems to me that the hinting
  <em>can</em> be done automatically. Target rasterized appearance of a glyph shouldn't
  be that hard to formalize and then, in a simplest case, a glyph can be fed to a
  simple evolutionary algorithm, which would iterate and try to converge to a reasonable
  hinting setup. One setup per glyph display size, and not necessarily in a TTF hinting
  format.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAlex\r\n\r\nPS. I am asking about all this, because auto-hinting
  seems to be the ultimate solution for making existing pool of typefaces \"web-safe\".\r\n"
