  the forum url or clicking \"my account\" on the right. \r\n\r\nHave anyone else
  experience this?\r\nI'm on a mac, running Firefox, btw. "

  body: Might it be a Flash Player issue? It happens to me too (Mac/Firefox here as
    well), though rather erratically; and it also happens on other Flash-based web
    sites. Dunno what the problem is. But FWIW, if I click about ten times in rapid
    succession I can usually "get through". :-)
