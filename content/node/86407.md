  excuse me if I'm writing this into the wrong topic, if an admin will change this
  and put it into the right place, I will be glad.\r\n\r\nAnyway: my problem is, that
  I just want to create a font (I made every glyphs in Illustrator) which is a normal
  outline font, but it is specialized for the size of 13 pixels on 72DPI (yes, this
  font is basicaly designed for screen purpose).\r\n\r\nI have Fontographer, because
  I have Lion on my Mac, and because I'm new to font creating. So what I want is,
  to import all my AI glyphs into my FOG file. The first thing I don't know, is how
  to calculate UPM size, to be best fitting for my needs. I read a lot of opinions,
  that UPM does not matter, some said, that this is count when the computer will scale
  it: I can't decide what is true, and why..\r\n\r\nThe next thing is when I import
  as EPS or paste them as AI outlines, they are going to have different sizes (\"a\"
  has the same height as \"b\", etc.) My problem is, I really don't know how to add
  specific sizes to outline, because on the Outline window the only tool I have is
  Scale tool, which can only be defined by percentages and not by em units, or pt-s.
  How to do this? Or I have to set my Illustrator canvas in a different way? I did
  not find any tutorial or help on Google, Vimeo and Youtube. And the FOG manual did
  not say anything about this either.\r\n\r\nOh, I almost forget, here are the details
  I want:\r\nWhile my font is set to 13pt:\r\n\r\nAscender: 13px\r\nCaps Height: 10px\r\nX-Height:
  7px\r\nBaseline: 0px\r\nDescender: -3px\r\n\r\nhas to be on the screen.\r\nWhich
  means from Ascender to Descender is 16px (because characters like: \xC9\xC1\u0170\xDA\u0150\xD3\xCD
  \u2014 Capitals with accents will be larger than the common 13px)\r\n\r\nAny help
  will be appreciated, or any link will help me.\r\n\r\nThank You very much! And sorry
  for my bad english.."

    instance 1024. Then one pixel would correspond to 64 font units.\r\n\r\nBut you
    would need to set the font at a size of 16 px, not 13, because the nominal font
    size is the measure from ascender to descender."

    seems like a nice set up.\r\n\r\nMy other problem is still there: how to import
    the outlines to have the same sizes, or how to change the sizes and positions
    to a specified one? Or how to set up my Illustrator environment to make it default?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "The classical problem is people might not know what point size\r\nto use
    to make the pixels \"click\". This is why there's a point\r\nsize convention irrespective
    of how many pixels tall the design\r\nactually is; and for various reasons that
    convention is 8 point.\r\n\r\nWhich means you:\r\n- Use an Em of 1000 (the legacy
    standard).\r\n- Use a grid of 125.\r\n- Let the pixels freely go outside the Em
    bounds.\r\n\r\nAnd when you use the font, you have to make sure no anti-aliasing\r\nis
    being performed. And you can use multiples of 125 for tracking.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the helps, again. It just turned out Jens solution is working
    perfectly.\r\n\r\nAfter few days of desperatly trying pasting Illustrator outlines
    to FOG, I finally have the solution. I share with you, because I guess a lot of
    newbies, have this same problem, and  can not find any answer on the internet.
    So here we go:\r\n\r\n1.) Create all the glyphs in one file in Illustrator on
    different layers. This is for the ease, because now you can select every outline
    from one single file, by hiding or showing the layers.\r\n\r\n2.) Create a new
    layer, and draw two lines on it, the first will be the Ascender and the second
    will be the Descender. You don't need other lines. Place them to the coordinates
    you wanted them to be.\r\n\r\n3.) Select one glyph plus the A and D lines, and
    press CMD+C (or Ctrl+C) to copy them.\r\n\r\n4.) Select one glyph-place in FOG
    and open the Outline window. Now paste it. You will see that the ascender line,
    and the descender line is in its right place, and therefore your glyph too.\r\n\r\n5.)
    Delete the A and D lines, you don't need them any more.\r\n\r\n6.) Repeat these
    steps with all your outlines from Illustrator.\r\n\r\nI hope this will be helpful.
    I now really enjoying spaceing, kerning, and things like that in FOG.\r\n\r\nP"

    but it's good to know there's a way.\r\n\r\n<em>Question: When somebody else wants

    that convention of 8 point comes from, has it got something to do with the way
    points are related to pixels at screen resolutions?\r\n\r\n<em>Also: An Em of
    anything other than 1000 will cause problems in some older systems.</em>\r\n\r\nNot
    if you generate the fonts as TrueType :) Hrant, you certainly know this but for
    Peter: powers of 2 like 2\xB9\u2070 (= 1024) were commonly used for TrueType fonts
    because the grid can be divided by two more easily/often (for machines)."

  body: "> I wonder where that convention of 8 point comes from\r\n\r\nI'm not sure,
    but I think some of the very early popular\r\npixelfonts were 8 pt, and when designers
    found themselves\r\ntrying to explain to users (\"Me, read the README?!\" :-)\r\nhow
    to make the rendering crisp they figured to just use\r\n8pt for everything. I
    might've chosen 10, but it's too late,\r\nplus one nice thing about 8 is that
    you can handle Ems that\r\nare a power of 2 in addition to the legacy 1000.\r\n\r\nEm
    of 1000: Peter didn't specify TT, and just to be\r\nsafe I recommend 1000, since
    in TT the worst that\r\ncan happen is a very small loss of performance, while\r\nin
    PS it can cause a... total loss of performance!  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the GUI is a resolution indepent interface, which means it is vector based OpenGL
    stuff, that's why I need PS fonts.\r\nIt won't cause total loss of performance,
    because we just made our own graphical system which is optimized for this special
    usage and for my special design. (we need to done our own framework, so we can
    easily port our software to any platform, without creating parallely double codes)\r\n\r\nIf
    this would be a totaly everyday-used font, I would agree with you, hrant, and
    the pixels won't be matters to me at all.\r\n\r\nDoes any of you knows what is
    the LineGap? I still don't know, and I'm curios."
