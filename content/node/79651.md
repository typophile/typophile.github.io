  body: "Hmm, I just looked at <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/80\">Mr Carbfred</a>,
    and it seems like an even more backslanted version of Miss Stanfort. (Actually,
    who knows which came first, but they are obviously related.) The fact is that
    the R in Mr Carbfred matches yours better, so I think the answer is that Mr Carbfred
    was slanted a bit.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
