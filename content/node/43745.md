body: "Considering the fact that Linotype and Berthold waged innumerable legal wars
  against each other, it is bizarre that Linotype now sells Berthold fonts.\r\n\r\nsee
  http://www.linotype.com/de/264710/bertholdtypesltd-library.html\r\n\r\n\"Who touches
  pitch, shall be defiled\", they say in the Hebrew Bible, but Linotype alias Monotype
  prefers the Roman proverb \"Money does not smell\".\r\n\r\nChris Lozos asked in
  another thread: \"If you can\u2019t sue them, join them? :-)\"\r\n\r\nFor addicts
  of knock-off clones, this bizarre new \"mariage d'amour\" between Linotype and Berthold
  has a big thrill: Now, for the first time at the Linotype website, knock-off clone
  addicts may buy BOTH \"the nefarious evil knock-off clone\" (Bruno Steinert's famous
  words concerning Arial) of the Helvetica font, called \"AG Book\", AND the knock-off
  clone of Akzidenz-Grotesk, called \"Basic Commercial\". I suggest that Linotype
  offers a \"combination discount\" to addicts of these knock-off clones in order
  to boost the sales figures.\r\n\r\nThere may be another reason, why Harvey Hunt
  now married his enemy Linotype: Since his law-cognizant wife Melissa decided to
  quit him, he now has nobody who can prepare new cease-and-desist letters and lawsuits
  against Linotype for him.\r\n\r\nsee also www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/berthold.pdf"

    sharing someone's private information is neither called for or welcome.

    here could testify, Melissa Hunt was very much a part of this business. I certainly
    have been at the receiving end of many  documents written on behalf of her husband.
    I certainly hope she has quit the type business for good, as that may put an end
    to a lot of arbitrary legal actions that have cost a lot of us time, money and
    sleep."

  body: I should like to mention that I now must doubt whether my above information
    that Melissa Hunt quit Harvey Hunt is correct, on account of two emails which
    I received. One email claims that Melissa quit Harvey, and the other email claims
    that Melissa did not quit Harvey. Since both persons who sent me emails are members
    of Typophile, it is up to them to corroborate their claims.
