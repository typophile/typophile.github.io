  well known for their typeface \xABSimple\xBB which first got used in their book
  \xABThe Things\xBB. Later, Ruedi Baur of Integral, Paris, asked them to redesign
  the typeface for use in the new corporate design of the Cologne-Bonn Airport - this
  version is named \xABSimple-Airport\xBB.\r\n\r\n<strong>Links:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.norm.to\">www.norm.to</a>\r\n<a
