  body: "Hey WhatFontis,\r\n\r\nI've tried your website, and most of the time it does
    work.  But for those that don't, I posted them here.  That's probably the only
    reason why I need human expertise to help me identify the font on this page.\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks to you and your website, though!\r\n\r\nCheers."

    take a part from the image with the text and convert to grayscale, we auto-adjust
