		<div class="commentbody">Hold on a second, I've died and gone to heaven !! <BR>This really is incredible stuff, David.  <BR>I don't think anyone could fault your Gaelic forms either. Bravo. <BR> <BR>There is something you might think about, though, maybe for the alternate set, in relation to the long 'r' and 's'. Nowadays, a lot of people often get the 's' and the 'r' mixed up. I'm working on a font with a colleague at the moment and we're trying to distinguish our long 's' and 'r' from each other as much as possible. Giving a curve to the descender on the 's' is one possibility we've come up with. <BR> <BR>BTW apart from Vincent Morely's work, what are you using for sources?  <BR> <BR>Matha</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I apologize for my delay in replying. Between Typophile.com's connection problems and my own connection problems, coupled with client work, it has been difficult to properly reply. <BR> <BR>First, thank you all very much for your encouragement and helpful critiques. <BR> <BR>To answer your questions: <BR> <BR>I referred to Victor Hammer's fonts (American Uncial, Neue Hammer Unziale, etc.). Karlgeorg Hoefer's Omnia provided the inspiration for my controversial upper-case &quot;W&quot;. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>The primary reference for my Gaelic glyphs has indeed been Vincent Morely's work. I also made use of the work of Luc Devroye and his complilation of Celtic/Gaelic font web references (<a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/celtic.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/celtic.html">http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/celtic.html</a></a>). <BR> <BR>As I have worked on Seriatim Uncial, I have begun to see the usefulness of a Gaelic-only version. Such a font would likely consist of the &quot;purist&quot; uncial forms, and a full Gaelic character set. Are there generally accepted character/keyboard assignments for specific characters in a Gaelic font, such as the long &quot;r&quot; and long &quot;s&quot;, et al? <BR> <BR>Thanks for all the replies! <BR> <BR>David</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David, <BR> <BR>I couldn't agree more that a Gaelic-only version would be very useful. Apart from what Vincent Morely is doing, Gaelic typography is very much focused on the past. There is an enormous need for display fonts, screen fonts, fonts for signage, as well as italics, small caps and bold&hellip;but everyone seems to be busy digitising old book fonts. Things have gotten so bad that they're using book fonts on street signs.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/8738.gif" alt="quay"> <BR> <BR>There's nothing particulary wrong with the font in itself but why not design something specifically for signage? The same is true of anything used on TG4, the Gaelic television channel, websites, brochures etc. Ironically, you'll find more book fonts used for display purposes than in books. <BR> <BR>Seriatim Gaelic would be a breath of fresh air. <BR> <BR>For any info on character/keyboard assignments, Michael Everson is the man: <BR><a href="http://www.evertype.com/celtscript/celtcode.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.evertype.com/celtscript/celtcode.html">http://www.evertype.com/celtscript/celtcode.html</a></a> <BR>I disagree with him on several (mostly philosophical) points but when it comes to encoding, he can't be faulted. <BR> <BR>Matha. <BR></div>

Of course, Americal Uncial has nothing at all to do with Irish or Gaelic, but that&rsquo;s a different thread altogether ;-)</p>
