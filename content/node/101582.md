body: "Are any two fonts (that are NOT monospaced) known to be matched in terms of
  the width of every glyph? I mean one that is serif, and the other is sans-serif.\r\n\r\nMy
  goal is not to pair or match fonts for aesthetics and use them together, but to
  find two that are interchangeable without having a single glyph need more or less
  space. If I need to purchase fonts, realize I'm on a schoolteacher budget but the
  investment would be worth it.\r\n\r\nHere's my situation:  When I introduce students
  to a printed material (yes, the dreaded \"worksheet\"), it's often helpful to display
  and review the entire thing on an overhead digital projector. For the print version,
  I believe serif is the most readable and looks nicer. For the display board, with
  some students straining to see from the back of the room, going with a simpler,
  more screen-readable sans serif would be ideal. Yet to throw off the line spacing
  (and therefore pagination) causes other woes. Right now the only reliable solution
  I have is to use hard returns and keep each line safely short of the margin.\r\n\r\nIf
  my basic idea is flawed, stop me here and tell me to go home. I apologize also if
  this question has already been answered. My lack of technical vocabulary in this
  area makes typing search strings a bit futile.\r\n\r\nJoseph Woodard"

    that a well-spaced, nice and readable serif <em>can't</em> have the same metrics
    as a well-spaced, nice and readable sans-serif, because the serifs introduce elements
    that affect the spacing. "

    probably cost you a lot.\r\nI think there would be some comprehension value in
    the materials looking exactly the same. I suggest you compromise with a slab serif,
    which would serve well for both close and distance reading. I remember a handful
    of books from when I was young that were set in Rockwell or Memphis and it never
    bothered me. You might consider Museo Slab."

  body: "I vote the basic idea is flawed. I think more important for readability is
    a balance of size and weight. \r\n\r\nWhat you could do, with the font mentioned,
    is to try the different weights for screen and print. My guess is that with the
    ASAP fonts, the normal for print & bold for projection might work. You'd have
    to experiment. I believe there may be other fonts that have the same setwidth
    for different weights, at least, to a point.\r\n\r\nYou could also experiment
    with one of the old Adobe Multiple Masters fonts, changing the width axis to,
    in effect allow the type to be larger/heavier for screen usage with the same character
    widths. The \"optical size\" axis in MM could also help; use a 6-7 point for the
    screen & a 10-12 point for print.\r\n\r\nNot sure that will work technically,
    or for that matter, to solve your problem, but if you're willing to try, it could
    be worth a shot."

  body: "I certainly agree (with Craig as well) that it's a marked compromise, but
    the proof is in the pudding: when you look at a setting of Compatil, can you point
    out cases of damage being done? Maybe when the compromises are properly managed
    the end-result is within a threshold of acceptability? Which is, of course, a
    variable thing, but I'd like to be shown that \"the 'i' is too tight/loose/wide/narrow\"
    for example. With that \"wide/narrow\" nicely reminding us that serifs can vary
    in size (something I did in Patria). Which of course brings us to the perennial
    existential question: What is a serif?  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_5106.png]\r\nCompare spacing
    and counter widths. In the serif versions, the straight-sided letters look cramped
    and narrow compared to the round-sided letters.\r\n\r\nTo my eye it seems like
    most of the compromising was borne by the serif versions. I wonder if the thinking
    is that the serifs make nonoptimal spacing more forgiveable. Or maybe they just
    had the sans face to start with.\r\n\r\nThanks for calling my attention to this
    typeface Hrant; I'd never encountered it before."

    I can recall, these were pretty much limited to roman duplexed with italic, or
    once in a while, roman duplexed with bold.\r\n\r\nAgain, I'd be be tempted to
    use MM technology, to get a larger x-height (on the optical axis) and a bit bolder
    for the projection fonts."
