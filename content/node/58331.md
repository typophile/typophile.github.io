  body: "I am pretty sure that's Milano Roman, an old ITC type that Image Club digitized
    in their old Letterpress CD's. I do not know of other digital versions.\r\n\r\nI
    have this font from Letterpress 6.0 and could set some type for you if you need
    a few words. (Sample is from the Serif Font ID Guide, made with the Image Club
    font)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/milano_roman_full_3852.gif]"
