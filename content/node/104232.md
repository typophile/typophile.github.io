body: Looking at the history of type and the role that process-based limitations have
  played in its design, what will be the future of type design as we approach the
  age when retina-level displays are the norm? Limitations on the design of type will
  be almost completely eliminated. Without these constraints, there is only a blank
  canvas. What do you see as the future of type?

    the demand for paid labor is dropping, globally. \r\n\r\nInfant mortality rates
    are dropping, but the birthrate remains essentially constant. \r\n\r\nEducation
    is just one more commodity; it's cost is through the roof.\r\n\r\nIn short, there
    are going to be a lot of people with no income, no useful skills, and not much
    hope of acquiring either. They will be hungry. And mad.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd say type
    design, along with most everything else, will be trampled under the feet of warring
    soldiers.\r\n\r\nThat do for you?\r\n\r\n"

    the same since day one: getting type to finally move out of the house of his parents,
    calligraphy and lettering. I mean really, he's in his 40s now.\r\n\r\nI think
    resolution crossing a threshold is relevant technically, but not in the above.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Ironically, the biggest limitation of screen typography is that it is scalable.
    Increased resolution will, I think, create a new technological monster to replace
    hinting -- the problem of how to adjust the appearance of typography according
    to absolute type size. We will have to go back to designing multi-size-specific
    fonts, or parametric fonts. Either way, that is a daunting constraint.

    how far away it was from your eyes? A constant optimum equation of x-height to
    arc of view.

  body: "We'll probably see script fonts gradually disappearing, since the ability
    to read cursive seems to be on the way out.\r\n\r\nFrom a recent New York Times
    article: \"Cursive should be allowed to die. In fact, it's already dying, despite
    having been taught for decades,\" said Morgan Polikoff, assistant professor of
    education at the University of Southern California's Rossier School of Education.
    \"Very small proportions of adults use cursive for their day-to-day writing...As
    we have done with the abacus and the slide rule, it is time to retire the teaching
    of cursive,\" Polikoff said. \r\n\r\nThe recently established Common Core State
    Standards, the standardized educational benchmarks for U.S. public schools, omit
    cursive as a requirement. Some states, including Indiana and Hawaii, have dropped
    cursive from their curricula."

  body: Not sure if script typography will survive but script lettering sure as hell
    will. If anything script lettering has soared the last 2 years I've seen, scores
    and scores of people like hand lettering/vectored versions for logos and such,
    hell I even get a ton of lettering projects (mostly script, cursive). Even Calligraphy
    is coming back in full force. More often than not the people I see who dislike
    script/calligraphy are the ones who can't actually draw and prefer a ruler/guides
    for everything and without measuring tools they'd be lost. Just my $0.02

    years. So it seems while the cursive form will disappear in general writing, I
    don''t think it can disappear completely. Also, with everything looking clean,
    automatic, rational and all that, there is a resurgence of everything old and
    everything we feel nostalgic about. I suspect the cursive form won''t disappear
    this century at least and I can barely imagine it disappearing in upcoming centuries. '

    and couldn't have been more wrong. In fact, I don't know of any predictions about
    the future on a scale of at least 50 years that was accurate. It could be a wild
    guess what the future of type design will be at all.
