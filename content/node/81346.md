body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nThis is a rather odd one, as I've read the FAQ regarding asking
  what font it is, and this one isn't really inclined to the prescribed rules, but
  I'll give it a try anyway!\r\n\r\nI've found this font on an artwork made by a DeviantArt
  member, sadly this DA member has been inactive for quite some time, so I'm unable
  to ask him directly. So any other info regarding the font is kind of unavailable.\r\n\r\nIt
  seems a very familiar font, but I can't seem to find the correct one! It has a lot
  of similarities with some, but then a single letter is different (often the v and
  w end up being different, with jagged points rather than smooth lines or so)\r\n\r\nHopefully
  someone can pin-point me in the right direction :)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    I have in MS Paint and PS CS5 display a different letter 'a', as well as different
    'f', 'w' and 'v'"

    and found the matching one on a font site, and it was indeed named Georgia Italic
    Bold ^^\r\n\r\nThanks for your help :)"
