  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Situation: In summer 2007 I contacted a wellknown typedesigner to finish a font (a sans serif - medium weigth) that I had started designing in fontlab - the task was to finished the fontset (missing characters, kerning etc) and expand it to a light and bold version + italics (slanted)- at the time of agrement the guy was broke so I paid upfront so he didn&rsquo;t had to worry about the rent. We agreed on a deadline october 2008 - final work.</p>
<p>In the months that followed I asked for material - to see how things was going but was told &ldquo;im doing this for another client - very busy - bla bla&rdquo; and time went - no font. Come summer 2008 I contacted the typedesigner and asked if we could make it for october deadline and suddenly I had to do some stuff myself- He said as he was not the designer and therefor would not design the missing charcters (we are talking east europe characters)?! - so I did the characters that I was asked to do in a few days (not to delay the process) - now december and I have just recieved a medium version that i will consider 90% done designwise (missing characters, optical adjustments)but no kerning and other technical stuff plus some of the things I requested had been totally ignored.</p>
<p>So we went from having a good relationship to really none - and I dont' know what I am getting or when (if ever) -  Or what I did since the guy didn&rsquo;t produce as agreed.</p>
<p>What I need is a good advice how to get the job done - A solution that i thought of is to get him to finish off the medium version and get somebody else to do the rest (the light and the bold) !? But with my luck I have no idea who to contact, so I can get the font done in the other weigths.</p>
<p>Basically I need somebody to proof check the work and somebody (maybe same person) to produce the other weigths.</p>
<p>The price he set and that we agreed on was 9000 €</p>
<p>Please note that the payment and price has been according to his charge - and I even gave an extra 1000 € this summer to speed up the process.</p>
<p>I have talked with a laywer - but they really don&rsquo;t understand the situation and a laywer in my opinion is something that will only cost money not produce a font.</p>
<p>Any suggestions is highly appriciated - and please don&rsquo;t ask for a name - I don&rsquo;t want to badmouth anybody.</p>
<p>regards
Lukes</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, for starters, this can be a cautionary tale for others: it&rsquo;s a bad idea to pay completely up front for work like this. Instead, it can be done based on agreed-upon milestones in the development. Plus, if you&rsquo;re going to be giving somebody nine thousand euro (or ten thousand in the end), it is actually worth putting a contract in place. Not that this all helps you any now, of course, for which I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>First, did you have communication by email or in writing such that you have a written record of what was agreed to?</p>
<p>Second, decide on what if anything you want from the existing type designer. Do you want him to do any more work? Do you want some or most of your money back? If there&rsquo;s stuff you want, you could ask him to agree to arbitration (another element that one could have put in a contract, if you had one), and get somebody knowledgeable and respected in the community, who you both agree upon, to be the arbitrator. The alternative would be to pursue him legally, but you seem uninterested in that, and as you say, that is a good way to make sure that lawyers make money rather than either you or the type designer.</p>
<p>I expect that many of the folks here would be interested in doing the finishing work for you. as well.</p>
<p>Both of these roles sound interesting to me, actually, though it would probably be a conflict of interest to have one person do both.</p>
<p>Good luck with all this.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you should count on how much money you should get back and then claim it! Then you end the cooperation immedietly with this person. I am sure you can find someone else to do the work better and faster. Just have a look in the list of foundries and designers at the Typowiki here on typophile and contact the persons you think could fit the job by looking at their websites and contacting them etc.
Hope you get it sorted out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The price you agreed to was fair, if a bit low for the work.</p>
<p>The length of time for this project (more than a year) seems really suspicious to me. Generally it should take a professional no more than two weeks to create a new weight from an existing design. Two weeks for the light and  two weeks for the heavy. Adding the additional Central European characters should be a fairly simple task. The kerning for the three fonts can be done in a week, and the slanted italics can be done in no time (if you just want digital obliques).</p>
<p>This is really routine work. It should have been completed in five or six weeks at the most. We have been doing this sort of thing for designers and art directors since 1990.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s hard to establish business relationships that are good matches, after all, that&rsquo;s the name of the game. Contracting out font production work is no sure thing.</p>
<p>It was foolish of you to pay such a large sum up front before you found someone you clicked with.</p>
<p>Type design and font production&ndash;don&rsquo;t always overlap.</p>

<p>This should have raised alarm bells right away. Well known and broke - seems like a recipe for disaster.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Do you have a written contract with the designer? I would have thought that a contract outlining the work, especially the missing characters, would be pretty black &amp; white, legally speaking.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well first, since my first post I have talked with a lawyer (again) and he said was a good idea to get experts opinion on the subject before we take any legal action - so thanks for for current and future feedback.</p>
<p>I have to mention that I have known the typedesigner for more than 7 years and have used him for several smaller type related projects (fixing characters in custom logotypes ) with no problems on quality and he delivered on time.</p>
<p>Also I did consider him as a friend as we have had many social meetings over the years - and lots of conversations outside the field of typedesign - what Im saying is that it was not always talks about fonts and business. The reason for his economic situation was more because of some bad investments and family issues &hellip;</p>
<p>Regarding contract we have verbal agreement (which by european law is just as legal as  written and which has numerous times been confirmed in email) so there should be no confusion about the task &ldquo;in a legal sense&rdquo;- except maybe for date of delivery - which has been agreed on to be november 2008  since the beginning - which the lawyer considered to be a little to loose - but since we already past november now that doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>I have contacted the typedesigner by email and made it clear that this current situation is unacceptable - and if he wish to &ldquo;continue&rdquo;, a written contract has to be made with specific deadlines (within near future). An alternative is that he pays for the finishing of the font by somebody else.</p>
<p>Again - thanks for the input.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James, if the work wasn&rsquo;t really done, 9000 Euro is not
a fair price at all! It&rsquo;s a lot of money, especially these days.
That said, paying up front was not smart at all, no matter
who you&rsquo;re dealing with; it becomes too tempting to sit on
your hands, or at least stall stall stall.</p>
<p>I suggest that if you&rsquo;re at your wits' end you need to start
playing hardball. For example tell him you will reveal
his identity on Typophile. If he refuses to do the work
then agree on a way for him to repay you part of the fee.</p>
