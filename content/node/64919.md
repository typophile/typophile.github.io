  body: "I think this is not very good at all. I wouldn't buy this beer. \r\n\r\nThe
    label looks like a clip art, the color scheme (esp. the white background) is odd,
    the drop shadow doesn't add anything, yet it makes the whole package look amateurish.
    This could work for a bucket of a hand-crafted paint at the country arts and crafts
    fair, but for the beer bottle it is not working at all. Perhaps others will see
    it differently though, just wait for other opinions."

  body: "youch, well thanks for the input.  heres the whole label i forgot to include
    in the post http://www.flickr.com/photos/nickhum/4152316792/sizes/o/in/photostream/\r\nperhaps
    some suggestions would help me further my process, the clip art comment is pretty
    funny, i actually view it as quite the opposite...however I don't look at much
    clip art so I wouldn't know.  I agree, the white definitely needs to be offed
    with something/another color.  Would you say the bucket feels too industrial...too
    detached from the idea of a drink?  Perhaps another illustration of what i'm trying
    to get across would achieve my message better.  Another bucket that doesn't look
    so...\"clip art\".\r\nThanks for the fresh eyes "

  body: "I'm going to have to agree, and thanks for posting the interface...\r\n\r\nshow
    it on a bottle. that grey colour you have ... sitting over beer in a bottle will
    look like...terrible.\r\n\r\nseems like a fairly playful brand, so run with it.\r\nmaybe
    it's the method in which the beer is brewed - so portray that in the deaign, backyardish.\r\nmaybe
    it's how they started...you're going to have to add some history to what you've
    got. even faux history.\r\nput a handle through the bottle!\r\nhave the lable
    as a single stroke of paint.\r\n\r\nget creative.\r\n\r\nI associate buckets with
    bucket bongs, insane parties and a lot of messiness...and spewing. So...sure;y
    there's a good spin on it. i.e, It might not be good...but there's LOTS of it.\r\n\r\n...unless
    of course this is your homebrew, then what you have is no doubt fine.\r\n<br />\r\n<br
