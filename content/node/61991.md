  \r\n\r\nScroll down to \"WebKit and iTunes LP Internal Structure\"\r\n\r\n<CITE>The
  iTunes LP experience is accomplished with HTML 4.01, CSS and JS. The interface feels
  very Flash-like, but there is no trace of it. The CSS animations are elaborate and
  smooth. Font files are referenced with an @font-face declaration in the CSS but
  there seems to be little to no use. Most text, even long passages of lyrics, is
  represented visually with a PNG file. I wonder if they originally intended to use
  font replacement for all text, but changed their mind.</CITE> \r\n\r\nFont licensing
  fun aside I wonder what the image-centric nature of the text does for accessibility? "

    that the need for font embedding, streaming and compression in video is the primary
    reason the OpenType spec ended up being standardized by the ISO MPEG group.\r\n"

    <strong>Fonts and Scrollbars</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u2022 &nbsp;<strong><em>Don\u2019t
    use Open Type.</em></strong> When using fonts, use SVG fonts, which  \r\n&nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; are small, render quickly, and scale better. The fonts to be turned
    \r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into SVG fonts need to be legally cleared for use within
    the iTunes \r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LP or iTunes Extras, and should be distributed
    in the package as an  \r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SVG font to restrict consumer usage
    of the font. \r\n\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, it is often better to use images
    rather than SVG fonts.  \r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See the next two suggestions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; \u2022 &nbsp;<strong><em>Use buttons instead of live text for menus.</em></strong>
    Use images for menu \r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; buttons, instead of an SVG font.
    This has a couple of advantages:\r\n \r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \xBB Rendering is
    the same on all platforms (Mac, Windows, Apple TV).\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \xBB
    You have more control over spacing of text since you can use kerning\r\n&nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; and other ways to make the text smaller or bigger, depending on
    how\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; much space the design allows.\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    \xBB No potential fonts rights issue.\r\n\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u2022 &nbsp;<strong><em>Use
    a JPEG for large blocks of text.</em></strong> Instead of using live text from
    a \r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; font for a song list or lyrics, make the list or lyrics
    an image.\r\n\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You have more control over sizing and spacing,
    which can be useful on\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lyrics pages where space is limited
    or for long, one-line lyrics that \r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; might not fit.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; JPEGs are smaller than fonts and compressed, so one small image
    gets\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; loaded into memory instead of larger-sized font elements.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; By putting lyrics in an image, the text can\u2019t be copied and
    pasted (legal\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; considerations).\r\n\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Rendering is the same on all platforms.\r\n\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No fonts rights
    issue (if there ever would be one)."

    suggest SVG. (Is there an actual SVG *font* format?) Why is it SVG can be made
    to render consistently, but CFF/TTF fonts can't?\r\n\r\n"

    fonts do render consistently (and well enough), if they are used large enough.
    \r\nAnd my guess is that SVG fonts, (an actual web font format), will not render
    consistently, (or well enough) if scaled small enough. \r\nThough this is pretty
    simple, it ain't been edyoukaded yet. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
