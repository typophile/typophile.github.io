  body: I like it, but I think you should use real text, set at different sizes, in
    order to facilitate a better critique.

  body: A good start, but your c and e have their stress going the wrong way, and
    o seems to be leaning to the left. Also your r has very small terminal indeed.
    And z serifs are too small, as well as all the upper case serifs.

  body: "Upon first glance, the sharp serifs seem less to come to point as they do
    to bulge nearer the stem; *ahem* sorry. That Moby Dick excerpt put me in a 19th
    century mode....\r\n\r\nAnyway, that only applies at large sizes, and clearly
    this is intended for small body copy. You might try curving the bracket though
    anyway, just so it looks right at both scales.\r\n\r\nThe rest of my criticism
    should be taken with a grain of salt because I suspect that viewing this on screen
    only is causing some of these problems... I don't have a laser printer at home
    to test it, though.\r\n\r\nThe /r/, as Tomi said, is too narrow. And the /c/ is
    off balance. I don't know what he's talking about with the stress and the leaning
    /o/, however.\r\n\r\nThe /g/ seems slightly to heavy. Again, this could very well
    be merely a screen/hinting issue, but looking at the 9pt paragraph, all the /g/s
    pop out.\r\n\r\nThe tops of the lager serifs on the capitals (e.g. on the E, F,
    I, J, etc.) seem to bulge upward; try dipping them slightly to compensate. Same
    goes for the lower serif of the /S/\r\n\r\nI would extend the narrow weight on
    the /U/ a little further down.\r\n\r\nThe narrow spots on the /O/ and /Q/ aren't
    as narrow as those of other letters. This is especially noticeable on the Q because
    of the narrow bit of the tail.\r\n\r\nAs far as other color issues, I would have
    to see a larger text with a greater variety of capitals. And preferably in print,
    but I'm afraid I can't help you there."
