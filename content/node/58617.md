body: "So I have just made my first <em>locl</em> feature (to substitute steeper acutes
  for Polish) and am very happy this works. However, when I select Polish as a paragraph's
  language in InDesign, this is also the only OT feature that works. All my existing
  \u2013language UNspecific\u2013 features only work when I select any language <em>but</em>
  Polish (or Hungarian, which also has a language specific feature). I can't even
  select a different figure style! I mean I can select it, but it doesn't work. It
  seems like the language thing obliterates/overrides all other options.\r\n\r\nWhat's
  the deal &ndash; am I supposed to specify in the \"general\" features that they
  are for any language, and not just the DFLT? \r\n(Apologies \u2013 this does feel
  like it's probably a rather stupid question\u2026)"

    to return to this useful thread when I understand a bit more about Opentype. Who
    would've thought there's so many possibilities?!
