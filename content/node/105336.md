  the source files? What was your experience?\r\n\r\nThe only one I'm familiar with
  is github (which hosts EB Garamond) but I'd like to know about other options specifically
  for the context of working in font design."

  body: SFDir or UFO sources in Mercurial or Git, using Github, Bitbucket or Gitorious,
    are all pretty much the same... I expect most projects to use UFO on Github in
    the near future, and I'm contributing to the https://github.com/xen/fontbakery/
    project to make such projects like Travis-CL :)
