body: "I'm wondering what sort of bug this is. When I compose Ncommaaccent for example,
  FL puts a cedilla, rather than a commaaccent on the N base glyph. This happens for
  all commaaccent glyphs. I know there has been extensive discussion about Romanian/Moldavian
  S and T cedilla/commaaccent characters, but haven't seen anything about the G, K,
  N or R commaaccent characters.\r\n\r\nSo I'm wondering if this is a problem with
  the FL alias file which is telling the 'create glyph' command to look for U+0327
  (cedilla) instead of U+0326 (commaaccent), or if it's a naming problem where the
  glyphs are supposed to be made with cedillas despite having commaaccent names?"

  body: "You are right! \r\n\r\nalias.dat is buggy in that regard, it says: \r\n\r\nNcommaaccent
    N+~uni0327.case\r\nNcommaaccent N+uni0327\r\nNcommaaccent N+commaaccent\r\n\r\nbut
    it should say\r\n\r\nNcommaaccent N+~uni0326.case\r\nNcommaaccent N+uni0326\r\nNcommaaccent
    N+commaaccent\r\n\r\nThis is the result of the -- now considered errorneous --
    canonical decomposition in the Unicode Standard, which decomposes U+0145 to U+004E
    U+0327. \r\n\r\nAlso, please note that in the meantime, we've changed the recommendation
    for glyph naming. Rather than \"Ncommaaccent\", the glyph should be named \"uni0145\".
    \r\n\r\n(Of course this also applies to all the other \"commaaccent\"-related
    glyphs).\r\n\r\nWe'll rebuild alias.dat to improve this, but it will take some
    time, since building it is a kind of a complicated process. \r\n\r\nThank you
    for catching this!\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Actually, the funny thing is that you seem to have uni0327 (the combining
    cedilla, properly named) in your font (right?) -- which most people do not have.
    That's the reason why the problem was not discovered earlier. \r\n\r\nAs you may
    notice, after the \"N+uni0327\" recipe, the next in queue is \"N+commaaccent\".
    And the way alias.dat works is that FLS tries to find the best match by stepping
    through the entries with the same glyph name, until it finds the largest number
    of fitting composites. \r\n\r\nSince most fonts don't have \"uni0327\" but they
    do have \"commaaccent\", the first rule got ignored, and the second one kicked
    in for most of them. So they did not experience your problem. \r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    many thanks!\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: 'Also, I shall mention that "uni0145" is a better name than "Ncommaaccent"
    because it will work in OTFs under Mac OS X 10.4, while "Ncommaaccent" won''t.
    The "*commaaccent" names were removed from AGLFN (Adobe Glyph List for New Fonts),
    so the "uni****" names are the recommended form for them. '

  body: "Well, I only put in the combining cedilla at U+0327 to test my suspicion
    the aliases file was at fault...it took me several hours to figure out how FL
    builds the composites! My commaaccent must have had a weird name to start with,
    or FL would have found it without needing the unicode.\r\n\r\nI'll make sure to
    call Ncommaaccent uni0145 henceforth. Thanks for your help."
