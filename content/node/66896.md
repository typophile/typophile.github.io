body: Countries in Southern Africa (South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi,
  Zambia, Tanzania, Angola, Mauritius, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Swaziland) have signed the
  SADC Transport Protocol which requires them to harmonise their traffic sign systems.
  The SADC traffic sign system is in use throughout South Africa and is gradually
  being adopted in the other SADC countries. A sample direction sign is illustrated.
  The typeface is DIN 1451. In my opinion the stroke width is too narrow and the letters
  are spaced too far apart (overcompensating for the night-time halation effect),
  but this is the standard. There is also a bold version for use with black lettering
  on white backgrounds, and a condensed "Narrow" version. As part of my work for the
  Government of Tanzania I have been promoting the use of the SADC sign system amongst
  road authorities. The example illustrated was produced using some South African
  software that automates the design of traffic signs. Although this is not as powerful
  as some British sign design software that I know of, it is fairly simple to use.
  In my work as a traffic signs consultant I have helped choose typefaces for official
  sign systems in Nepal, Bangladesh, Kerala, Ghana, and Uganda. The Transport typeface
  was selected for the "english" legend and we used a locally-available typeface for
  the "local" language - after readability tests with a panel of local drivers. Contact
  me if you need more information on any of these matters.

    in Southern Africa that are not written in a Latin-based script."
