<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Esteemed people,
I think I am pretty good at scratching fonts. I have taste and talent, and enjoy it a lot, really. Yet, when opening fontlab, I get bored so easily. I find difficult to exactly match the style along the glyphs, and after some efforts I give up. The result is often an ugly and ill-matched set of glyphs I'd be ashamed to show someone. Crap.
Do you have any suggestion on how to approach digital font design in an easy way?
thank you very much

Yes: a lot of fontmaking is dull, grueling, boring and repetitive. If you ever hope to make a decent font, I would suggest that you get a new attitude.</div>

It sounds like you are biting off more than you can chew.
Try doing a design with a very simple structure, where glyphs are constructed from a small group of basic elements which are copied and pasted. Most simple: a sans serif "techno" font, somewhat condensed, where many characters have a common width. (There is still room for subtleties such as variation of stroke width between horizontal and vertical, and between caps and lower case.)
Concentrate on getting this to look good in words, by working on the widths of the sidebearings as part of the design process.
If you can tolerate this procedure, and produce a font you are not ashamed of, there's hope for you yet. </div>

<div class=commentbody>It sounds like separating the design from the actual creation might help you. If you draw/construct your glyphs by hand or draw them in Illustrator so that you are happy with the overall look and feel, and then work in Fontlab.

<div class=commentbody>Nick,
yes, you got the point. I'm biting far too much. I bought Fontlab and I thought I could start off with a very easy task: a Garamond-like font. :)
Yes, I know, I could have chosen a Blackletter with ornaments, but you know...
Stephen,
you did fine! Sorry but English comes quite 'unnatural' to my mindset. I prefer French :)

<div class=commentbody>Massimo, if you find that some aspects of type design are beyond your nature, that doesn't mean you have to completely give up; but you do have to find somebody (or some font house) to help you out. Note that Eric Gill's status as a type designer is taken for granted, but he didn't do any of the spacing!

<div class=commentbody>Hrant,
that sounds very interesting!
I could sketch the prototype, and someone turn it into digital!... wow! :) I'd like that!
Anyone here? :)
Btw, can I protect sketches with any copyright?...
thanks</div>

<div class=commentbody>Massimo,
I don't think it's an attitude thing that you're facing here but the quality of the FontLab interface. (I only know 4.6, not the 5.0) A good interface doesn't make one a better designer but it sure helps enjoying the process if you enjoy the process you'll get better at what you do since you'll do it more often. Maybe that's what bugs you.
To your recent question, you'd be surprised what type producers would do for money :)
Your sketches are automatically protected by copyright law I'd think. Does anyone differ?

If you reverse those two statements, you may find that you differ with yourself. A legally enforceable copyright requires legal documentation, and legally enforcing the copyright requires a lawyer (unless you're the music industry, in which case it requires congressmen in your pocket). Unscrupulous people are rarely bothered by niceties, or even legalities, if it's up to the copyright holder to enforce his or her rights.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Massimo, since I'm still a type designer in diapers (a novice type designer) I understand your frustrations. It sounds to me like you're just starting out. Once your computer drawing skills start to catch up with your mind, things will go a lot quicker. There are of course still going to be some tedious moments, but after awhile you'll get the hang of it. It just takes practice, practice, practice. I'm on my 3rd or 4th type redraw right now and still have yet to produce a result that I'm completely happy with.
Give it time. I'm much faster now, and know where to move and what to do to make improvements. I had to f*ck up many times before it came easier. </div>

<div class=commentbody>It could also be that you design the letters and then allow the foundry to flesh it out. I do know, for instance, some foundries do accept designs and then do the technical work themselves.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Another aspect is the idea of process. I have been involved in several art forms and the most exciting moment is always the genesis, the kernel. I was talking with a history professor and he agreed that a lot of great things come from microcosmic observations by someone who could expound on the idea. In other words, I used to be an idea man who never completed anything, now I like to take one idea to it's logical conclusion. Finishing it is always the hard part, but very rewarding once you do. Then you can move onto something else…

<div class=commentbody>You could use your talent/passion to create type which doesn't neccesarily adhere to the rules of drawing type traditionally (calligraphic/humanist … Garamond). Or monoweight type, grid systems within type (Wim Crouwel), if you have the passion to draw type you will learn. Try drawing the type from a print out – print out Garamond at a large point size and draw it down in pencil – you'll remeber the flow of the forms better than pasting beziers straight into Illustrator or Fontlab!</div>
