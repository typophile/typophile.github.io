  IDLEWILD from Hoefler . Idea is a dark room. Was also thinking about making the

  body: "If you are considering color, keep in mind printing costs. If you print it
    offset you could be facing big printing bills not to mention registration errors.
    \r\n\r\nIf you want full color, then plan on going digital only for the printing
    process. The downside to digital is that unless you have it done on a commercial
    digital press the quality will likely suffer.\r\n\r\nGradations also can be a
    real pain to print, so be careful there. It's probably best to avoid using one
    if you can. Take your finished design to a commercial printer and speak with one
    of their knowledgeable staff. If you want a professional job, avoid any franchise
    printing operations such as Minuteman Press, and especially avoid Kinko's. Kinko's
    is great for copies from copiers, but they don't hire professional printers."

  body: I would suggest the same space between M. K. and Studios. Perhaps a little
    more space between M. K. and a little less space between K. S . . .

  body: the external IOS is annoying and distracts from the excellent graphic. either
    put MKstudios above the square or in it. Or put all the lettering to the right
    of the square  outside it.
