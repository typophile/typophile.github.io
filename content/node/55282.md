body: "It's funny how bad type stands out more once you learn about what constitutes
  as \"bad type\". The examples I have are things that I know I've seen before, but
  before I started taking graphic design classes, they never stood out THIS much.
  I had often thought that some things looked funny, but I never really thought of
  why they looked like they did or even stopped to think that it was a poor design
  piece. The, the other day, I realized how obvious bad type is to me now. I was reading
  this article in an \"Enquire\" magazine when, in the middle of reading, i thought
  to myself, \"wow, that's bad!\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC00370_2_6406.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC00371_2_4734.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  the first image, the text is forming the shape of the picture in the middle of the
  text. A few of the words have horrible kerning, making rather larger spaces between
  each letter. In both images, there is HORRIBLE tracking with large spaces between
  words. It looks absolutely horrid to me. As soon as I spotted the first mistake
  of the article, I'm sad to say that I was half expecting to find an \"orphan\" at
  the end of one of the paragraphs. I couldn't help but wonder how someone let this
  article go published like that.\r\n"
