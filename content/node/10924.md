    <BR>   <BR>I don&#39;t have any first-hand experience with Paradox &#40;or any
    of the other beautiful faces from the Dutch Type Foundry, although many of them
    are on my wish list&#41;, but I would start my search among DTL&#39;s selection
    of sans serif faces. I&#39;d look first at sans serifs designed by Gerard Unger,
    who designed Paradox, as his sans serif designs might well work compatibly with
    Paradox.   <BR>   <BR>Good luck!   <BR>   <BR>David'

    work? <BR> <BR>By the way, what&#39;s up with the spacing in the image on the
    page I&#39;ve just linked to? Ugh! Shame on you, Gerard!

  body: Could be an issue with on-screen rendering. <BR> <BR>David, Unger&#39;s faces
    are almost all harmonious &#40;in fact many of his fonts seem to share very similar
    letter-widths&#41;, so look first in his collection. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: david, thank you for your post and the links i should have provided... it
    was my first inclination  to pair Paradox with another Gerard Unger typeface because
    of everything Hrant said, but  it seems that maybe another Unger face migth be
    too harmonious if that makes sense. so i&#39;m looking for a more creative pair
    something with more contrast... also for more backround, these typefaces will
    be used in a fresh new literary publication.

    is a highly complex beast. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Vesta would be your best bet, but if you need a big family with many weights
    and sc and osf, Argo from DTL would be great. I chose Coranto with Vesta for a
    project and they work extremely well together. Paradox is almost identical to
    Coranto, only that it has a smaller x-height and longer ascenders and decenders.
