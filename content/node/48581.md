  looks great, but a bit dry. I was hoping to set my name in a different font to add
  a little flavor, but can't find a good pairing.\r\n\r\nAnyone have a good suggestion
  for a display font to pair with Whitney? My initials are S.H. so anything with nice
  versions of those letters would work well.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nSam"

    website]]. The Gotham SC with wide tracking they show as an example might look
    nice on a resume.
