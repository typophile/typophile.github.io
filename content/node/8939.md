  body: Oh, I forgot to mention that I don&#39;t need something exact &#40;this is
    possibly somewhat custom&#41;. I&#39;m willing to redraw some parts of it, but
    I&#39;d like to have a base that is similar.

  body: That &#34;M&#34; makes it seem to me like they started with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times/roman/testdrive.html?s=YANIME&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Times</a> and then put in a slew of extra lines, stretched some
    anchor points, etc.

  body: I figured it was based off something, never figured it to be so common. Times
    New Roman is not quite it &#40;the top of the Y on TNR is a little wide&#41;,
    but at least I have a base. Thanks.

  body: No problem.  Like we said, Times is only a base.  Whoever designed this sample
    seems to have clipped the serifs off of the Y, I, N, and E characters, which is
    easy enough to do in any edit program.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Starstruck is a really neat font, I think...and I&#39;m
    sure you&#39;d rather use it than try to re-create the logo ;&#41;
