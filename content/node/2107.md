body: This may be dumb, but I have to ask. <BR> <BR>What is the current practice with
  respect to design work and how one charges clients? Do I, as the designer, purchase
  the font and license for my cpu and then simply deliver the finished product to
  he client charging  for only for the work? <BR> <BR>Are client&#39;s expected to
  pay for fonts if they are not to actually be installed on their cpu? <BR> <BR>What
  if I buy two typefaces and ultimately decide that only on is appropriate for the
  job?

  body: Tim, not a dumb question at all. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know what &#34;standard
    practice&#34; &#40;if such a thing exists&#41; is, but I usually purchase and
    license the fonts myself, and either wrap it into the project charge or line-item
    it as &#34;materials&#34; on the invoice. If it&#39;s something like a major campaign
    or identity project -- a project with a long life and/or broad application --
    then I&#39;ll help the client license it directly for their own use. <BR> <BR>Sometimes
    it doesn&#39;t seem appropriate to pass the charge on to the client &#40;like
    in your example, if I buy fonts that don&#39;t get used in the project&#41;. In
    those cases I just absorb the expense as part of the cost of doing business. It&#39;s
    never a bad thing to have more typefaces in my toolbox.
