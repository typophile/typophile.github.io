    Got quite the bruise on my palm.

  body: 'Do a Google search for Rounded Corner Punches. Most craft stores carry them,
    usually the radius is .25" or .5". Also if you have a lot of stuff to punch, you
    could probably stop by your local printer and see if they''ll do it for you. Usually,
    they''ll do it for free. '

  body: "LOL eliason, the problem with fingernail clippers would be to get the paper
    ligned up perfectly not to get \"dents\" or semi-rounded corners. But thanks for
    the tip anyway! I've already been out & h\xE0ve found a few ornamental corners
    punchers, but no regular rounded one. Since tomorrow all stores will be closed,
    I'll go check out some more stores on wednesday. Wish me luck!"

  body: "Linda's right, I picked up a Fiskar Round Corner Punch from Staples a few
    years ago. Forgot I had it, and just found it buried in my art supplies. It's
    nice, but like Stephen says, it's murder on your hands after a few punches. \r\n\r\nSeriously,
    if you have a lot of corners to round, hit up the printers, they'll either have
    a slab press that have a corner rounder thing on it, or they might have a small
    appliance that's operated by foot pressure and they'll probably let you do the
    work. "

  body: Friend of mine converted their drill press to hold a dowel where the drill
    would be and built a small jig for the punch and to line up the papers -- that's
    about the only way I'd ever do more than a dozen or so....  ;-)

  body: Fiskars does indeed make high quality stuff. I am <em>still</em> using the
    pair of orange-handled scissors I bought in 1972, and have never had them sharpened.
    Admittedly I never use them to cut chipboard, plastic, etc. but still . . . pretty
    amazing that they have kept their edge for so long.

    (in my designs) & would like to have a device to add the effect to the paper instead
    of having to leave some white spacing around the edges to give it that rounded
    corner look.\r\nI do like some of the more decorative ones as well, but I usually
    make very simplistic, geometric drawings, so I'd prefer a simple corner punch.
    But at least I know now these things exist & I'm sure I'll find one to my likings
    soon. Too bad the stores are closed tomorrow ;-)"

    possible stores that might carry these corner punchcuts (I even went to a toystore
    since they sometimes have arts & crafts supplies as well), but all I could find
    was the decorative corner punchers... Even AVA (which is a wellknown arts & crafts
    supplies wholesale store chain in Belgium) didn't have them. in the last store
    (where they had the decorative ones BTW) I asked if they could order it, but sales(wo)men
    tend to get kind of crabby around closing time apparantly.\r\nI'll be going to
    Antwerp next week & I know a few adresses there where they might have it, so wish
    me luck!"
