		<div class="commentbody">I think it's tracked too tightly, and I might try more contrast between the two font weights. The c draws too much attention right now, and I think maybe it's because it looks much fatter than the r. But, it could just be that it's too close?

The mark is cool and I especially like the placement. Have you tried flipping it so the tail end points in? Just a thought.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My two cents. The mark sounds to me very "tribal" and "organic", surely "creative" and "dynamic" as well. The relationship with animation/movies is not immediate, though. I will say tattoos or garden design if I didn't know the company's service. I like the placement and the contrast between organic logo/rational type. I will also consider alternatives to Helvetica.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That's a very interesting mark. I didn't see the letters at first, it looked more like a theatrical mask. 

The white outline will need to be fatter, especially for small sizes.

I second finding an alternative to Helvetica. There are lots of attractive grotesques.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">immediate thoughts are its very feminine (not saying that's a bad thing, just an observation).

I'm guessing you're going for motion/vibrant over anything else.
imo it's not getting the young/creative thing...but that could just be me.

while it might be a nice little bonus, I really wonder whether forcing 'letters' into the mark is necessary.

motion arcs, line, onion skin.</div>

Oh, and no, it doesn't say "animation studio" immediately -- Thank God! If I see one more logo with stylized mouses or funky pixels I'm gonna open a vein. I much prefer an evocative design that suits the tastes of the studio's customers instead of the tools a studio uses to create animation. It's not like they're selling animation work to software developers. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">thnx guys for the comments,

i ve actually tried it to be tribal and organic as Alaskan n Luca said
to give the meaning of alive n life-like feel.

i also agree with the small space between the mark, sure will try
out a new version with more space.ty evenbong.

forcing the word arc was an attempt with the style,but i am open 
to suggestion to make it more descriptive about the service which
is animation,will there be a tweak it and wat exactly wd to make it
scream ANIMATION !!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">it's a tough one, lots of people see animation as computer generated, rather than story telling and bringing things to life (regardless of medium). It's also not a genre.

but maybe there's something in that...'bringing things to life'


arc - noah, the frames came in two by two.

just throwing it out there.

The mark also evokes "tattoo." Overly complicated and not memorable. If someone saw this for 5 seconds, would they remember how to draw it later? I know that's not the litmus test of a good design, but I'd consider simplifying it. Your approach is appropriate. Let that swooshy thing crystallize into something simpler.

Perhaps "AS" can become a swirling monogram? You've almost got a lowercase "a" there...</div>

And I don't think you need to try to spell 'arc' with the lines. It isn't obvious enough. Focus on emotion and energy, not cleverness.</div>
