  possible, such as the ones in the attached file.  I quickly identified Futura T
  Demi, but the two top headers I'm afraid I can't name so easily.  In addition to
  the faces in the attached image, any other suggestions are welcome to create that
  60's classified doc's look.  Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I agree on the top being Franklin Gothic, middle looks like Univers Light
    Ultra Condensed, but the height of the crossbars are too high.

  body: "@Stephen: That certainly looks close, but I think it's slightly different,
    namely the C, & S, though other letters vary too, like the M and R.  Am I mistaken,
    or is this not Franklin Gothic?  Or is this just another (or older) version of
    FG?\r\n\r\n@paulstonier: As you noted, Univers is also slightly different from
    the middle text.  \r\n\r\nEither of these will do in a pinch, but I'd really like
    to find the originals...\r\n\r\nOnce again, any OTHER type suggestions (or actual
    examples) from that era/category are very welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    today. FG is your closest digital match.

    at fontshop.com, which indeed is different from this example you've left, paragraph.
    \ Thank you both for helping me with this.  Where is this sample from, paragraph?\r\n\r\nI
    didn't realize that I was looking at ITC Franklin Gothic on fontshop.com...could
    you explain to me the difference between the two?"
