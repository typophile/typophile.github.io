body: "I have a line of text 8pt FF Din light, and when I select optical kerning the
  sentence grows longer rather than tighter and what Id expect, attached is an example,
  it seems way too loose. what do you think and why does optical kerning increase
  the sentence length? I would have though most kerning involves tightening letter
  combinations.  \r\n\r\nThanks for all help\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Optical adds letter spacing at smaller sizes but reduces spacing at display
    sizes, based on point size. Can't see your link.

    word space has to increase in [approximate] proportion.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
