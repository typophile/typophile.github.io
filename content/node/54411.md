body: Blambot (apparently a member here; <a href="http://typophile.com/node/21084">previous
  discussion</a>) published an entire guide to <a href="http://www.blambot.com/grammar.shtml">Comics
  Grammar & Tradition</a> that seems almost as rigorous as the BMW style manual. (Actual
  author credit is Nate Piekos.) Who knew there were so many rules about italics (actually
  obliques)?

  body: "The one thing he neglects is the series of five or more dots alone in a word
    balloon, sometimes accompanied by punctuation or a breath syllable. It is not
    an ellipsis, which he does cover. This is more of a tradition in Japanese comics,
    indicating a speechless hesitation with ambiguous meaning. Since this is a guide
    for comic letterers, this might be an important addition, considering the volume
    of translations that are published these days (and the domestic writers that are
    influenced by them) that they might be called to work on.\r\n\r\nHe makes a good
    point about the use of the crossbar \"I\", which is something to consider in developing
    a comic lettering font. "

    1986-87 lettering by Dave Gibbons. He mixed serif and sans in his I's so I put
    serifs on CS since the 'l' and 'I' could be different and he seems to follow the
    personal pronoun rule.  \r\n\r\n"

  body: I generally write in all-caps, and I also use the vestigial serifs on the
    personal pronoun.
