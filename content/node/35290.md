    similar. Maybe it's wider. Otherwise, it might be stretched horizontally.\r\n\r\n

  body: "The other one I was thinking of was High Noon, but it's just as narrow. I'm
    gonna bet your sample is Mesquite since it has no lowercase, and Mesquite is bundled
    with some Adobe products.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    or something?  Is there any quick way to get that effect or would you have to
    tweak it by hand?"

    which looks like a standard Illustrator effect. I think there's a \"warp\" tool
    in Illustrator, but I'm a CorelDraw user, so I don't know.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
