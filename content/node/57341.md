  Burrill and Craig Ward....\r\n\r\ni found this (http://typophile.com/node/29280)
  previous post on here, and these suggestions for letterpress style fonts (Monotype
  Grotesque 1 & 2, Bureau Grotesque 1 & 2, Grotesque No. 9, Gothic No. 13),\r\nbut
  as i have no access to an actual press, i was wondering if anyone has made any really
  nice authentic looking fonts directly from original woodblock or letterpress lettering
  with imperfections an' all....?\r\n\r\ni found some by Chank, but wasn't really
  digging them...\r\n\r\nor does anyone have any good photoshop tips on how to grunge
  up a font to make it look letterpressed....? i don't want a totally over the top
  grunge effect, just a look that is as real and subtle as possible, as close as possible
  to the real thing like the Burrill and Ward examples attached...\r\n\r\nall suggestions
  welcome!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/anthonyburrill_5777.gif]"

  body: There area variety of ways to weather type but none will look as authentic
    as the real thing, without a great deal of work. Look at the arrow in the sample
    above and how the ink works at the edge. This sort of thing could only be achieved
    on a character by character basis. A good basic approach would be to have a texture
    (wood grain, or solid letterpress coverage from a solid block) scan that, use
    threshold to reduce to black and white, lay texture under the type layer, and
    then cause the text layer to blend using the lighten function. Wherever the texture
    is white the type will appear to have decayed. Good luck.

    products, but they seem to fit your bill, so take a look and let us know what
    you think:\r\nhttp://withoutwalls.com/index.htm\r\n\r\nI would also recommend
    the Machine Wash filters from Mister Retro; I used them to create two of the fonts
    in my <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=ODEx\">Black Monday</a>
    series and was very happy. They don\u2019t necessarily do anything with Photoshop
    that you can\u2019t do with stock images, layers, and blending modes, but they
    do it very quickly and conveniently at a great price: http://www.misterretro.com/machine_wash_filters_bundle.html"

  body: "The Chank Fonts were 'digitally grunged'. The best way to get authentic looking
    letter pressed wood type is to get scans of authentic letter pressed wood type.
    AFAIK, that's exactly what the Wood Type Impressions product is.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    for that price, go talk to a local letter press studio and I'm sure they could
    give you the real thing. "
