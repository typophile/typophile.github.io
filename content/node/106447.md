body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/agatha_4264.png]\r\n\r\nCame across this
  lovely \"g\" (top). It's from the movie The Mirror Crack'd (1980).\r\nThe font is
  defenitely Friz Quadrata Bold (bottom), but I haven't seen this \"g\" before. I
  thought perhaps it's been derived from \"3\", but it's not ;)\r\nDoes anyone know
  if there's a different version of Friz Quadrata, or is this custom?"

    Silver (Brendel Informatik), Dispando (NovelFonts!), DennisBecker Bold (SoftMaker
    Software), OPTIDiamond (Castcraft), Quid Bold (FontBank) and Anticlaire Display
    (SSI).

  body: "@apankrat Yup, I'm sure. It spells the name \"Agatha Christie\".\r\n\r\n@koeiekat
    Indeed so! Nevertheless, as far as I can see, all these fonts postdate 1980, so
    it *has* to be Friz Quadrata (1973).\r\n\r\n@.00 You must be right, thanks."
