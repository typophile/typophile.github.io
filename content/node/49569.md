  of a custom font, how would that person go about and make a whole font out of it?\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone point me in a general direction?\r\n\r\nAlso, these custom letters I have
  do resemble other fonts but are not completely like them. Can these fonts be used
  as an example or basis from where I could make a font out of these custom capitals?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nStruba"

    yourself, or are you looking to have a type designer create a font from said capitals?
    For the former draw the rest of the alphabet, the figures, accents, punctuation,
    etc. Then digitize it, space it, kern it, test it, repeat. For the latter, just
    start asking for bids. \r\n\r\nAs for using other typefaces as the basis for new
    type, that\u2019s fine as long as there\u2019s a real difference and some serious
    creativity in the new design. If the design doesn\u2019t change much, you\u2019ll
    need to find a lawyer familiar with EU IP law to work out a deal between yourself
    and whomever owns the rights to the first design. (This assumes that you plan
    on doing the work in the EU, in theory an American designer can produce knockoffs
    with impunity)"

  body: "It depends on which letters there are to start with, but it's certainly possible,
    and is done rather frequently, most often when a custom lettered corporate logotype
    is expanded into a full alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe result is inherently derivative,
    of course, but there is a whole separate debate on how derivative a font can be
    before it's infringing and that's not what you're asking about.\r\n\r\nTo a limited
    extent, one can trace out the existing letters and cut and paste components of
    those to form the other letters, following some basic rules of type design and
    recognizing the stylistic character of the source material. After a point plenty
    of original drawing and curve tweaking will be required, but the component approach
    can get you a lot of the way before that.\r\n\r\nThese presentations may explain
    it better:\r\n[[http://typophile.com/courses/type101]]\r\n[[http://typophile.com/courses/type110]]"
