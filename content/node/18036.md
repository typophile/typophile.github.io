    remarkably similar to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/etelka/\">Etelka
    Light Pro</a>. \r\n\r\nPerhaps you could try making some of the characters a little
    more distinctive to gain better differentiation between the two faces?"

    body: Thanks for your comments Jon. I'd have to disagree though,  they're nothing
      like each other.

        body: "No problem Jon. I did ask for constructive comments though on how to
          make the design better, not what other typefaces it has a similar feel to.
          I've been working on this typeface a long time so maybe i'm a little too
          protective of it. Sorry if I snapped.\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\n\r\nTokyodrifter\r\n"

  body: Keep consistency, punctuation marks are not structurals but they give a swerve
    to the face, say they are more functional. Make them (i, j) stronger and consistent.
    Design your ligatures fi, fl when you have done with the metrics.

    and some smarta$$ comes along with what might appear to be a cheap shot \u2013

    constructive recommendations I can make."

  body: "This is a good start, but some of your curves are letting you down, espcially
    the top bout of the a, the tail of the g, the c and e, and the s, which looks
    like it's falling over to the left. The uppercase has fewer such issues, and C
    and G are pretty good, but the J needs help, and the S also looks like it's falling
    over. \r\n\r\nAs has been pointed out, the dots should be consistent, and if you
    do go with squares, they should be @20% larger, otherwise they look too small.\r\n\r\nThe
    \xE6 shouldn't have a the stick up its butt. \r\n\r\nThe top diagonal of the k
    is a little too far to the right.\r\n\r\nThe two components of the m should be
    a little bit narrower. It needn't be a lot.\r\n\r\nThe accents don't match terribly
    well; they are a little thin, and taper a little too much; they should match the
    design of the font. The cedilla looks like it's from a completely different font.\r\n\r\nYou
    might want to look at the way many people design w; in my opinion, the outside
    strokes should be brought in at the top. (It's a little hard to explain, but have
    a look at this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GalPol_w.png]\r\n\r\nSee
    what I mean?\r\n\r\nYou have done a good job making sure that the places where
    your strokes intercept don't get too thick, which is a hard trick to learn. On
    the whole, I think this is pretty solid work. Not amazingly original, but it has
    potential and will serve you well."
