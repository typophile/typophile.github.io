  run a whatsit thread before I go through the trouble of recreating it.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23460.jpg"

  body: There&#39;s not much connection to Eurostile in this except that it is squarish.
    I don&#39;t have much time for hunting right now, but <a href="http://www.t26.com"
    target="_blank">T-26</a> has about the largest &#39;Techno&#34; collection of
    any regular foundry, and it might be worth a look through that selection. &#39;Luggage&#39;
    and &#39;Phuture&#39; are two fonts I seem to recall might resemble this better
    than Eurostile.
