    hack the Apple Color Emoji font from the iPhone. I figured out the \xBBsbix\xAB
    table format and extended the Python FontTools so that I was able to decompile
    the table and extract the glyph images. The PNGs are in a different format than
    usual, supposedly to be rendered faster on the iPhone's processor, but I found
    a Python script that converts them to the standard PNG format.\r\n\r\nBTW anybody
    could do that with a little web research and general knowledge about font formats,

    if Apple want to extend the support for this to more and different devices, with

    -- and you should have heard the arguments about that in Unicode circles! -- that
    doesn't mean they <em>need</em> to push the boundary of what constitutes a font.
    There is no reason at all that text encoded characters need to be represented
    by glyphs in a font; they could just as easily be represented by any indexed collection
    of bitmaps, vector graphics or, for that matter, robots with spraycans.\r\n\r\nI
    think there are acceptable reasons why we might want to be able to incorporate
    colour into fonts in future: mostly in display type, of course, but also for text
    in some scripts that have traditionally used multi-colour signs (Ethiopic is an
    obvious example) but have been unable to do so in typography. But rushing to a
    bitmap-in-font solution as Apple have done to solve a particular use case for
    emoji seems to me shortsighted in a way that makes Adam's tentative analysis of
    the SVG option really very thoughtful in comparison."

  body: "There are, broadly, two approaches to standardisation. One is that you makes
    something and then try to get other people to accept it as a standard, on the
    basis of its technical merits an/or the basis of its implementation. The other
    is that you recognise a need for or a benefit to standardising something and you
    sit down and start spec'ing a standard before you start making something.\r\n\r\nMuch
    of the mess that Web developers have to deal with is the fallout of a history
    of individual companies making things for their own 'constituencies' (customers,
    user base), rather than creating and following standards. And that includes the
    mess that is cross-browser text rendering, which you have elsewhere suggested
    should be standardised rather than treated as an area of competition.\r\n\r\nAdam
    doesn't have a constituency. Which suggests that he's going to look at ideas based
    on general benefit and technical merit rather than corporate advantage.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not faulting Apple for rushing to market with a colour bitmap in font solution
    for emoji, which serves their constituency and keeps their phones in a competitive
    position. I'm saying that a) there are use cases for coloured display of encoded
    characters that go beyond emoji, and b) a bitmap-in-font implementation doesn't
    seem like a good long-term basis for standardising support for such use cases.
    You said that SVG was \u2018silly and shortsighted\u2019, and I'm saying that
    colour bitmaps is shortsighted.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, you said that pushing SVG
    was silly and shortsighted in light of the problems we already have with TTF rendering
    on the web. But that doesn't follow, because while TTF rendering has been treated
    as an area of competition, and hence of differentiation and non-standardisation,
    by OS and browser makers, SVG is a Web standards project, and there is better
    chance of getting cross-browser compatibility in SVG rendering that there is in
    TTF rendering. Note that this is <em>not</em> to suggest that SVG can replace
    TTF as the text font format of choice for the Web, but that the rendering problems
    of TTF are independent of whatever might be done with SVG. So it doesn't make
    sense to me to criticise SVG on the basis of what doesn't work in TTF on the Web."

    SFNT-based fonts (i.e. OpenType fonts) that include an SVG table for outline description.\r\n\r\nThinking
    <em>only</em> of SFNT-based fonts with glyf|CFF table <em>plus</em> SVG table
    (meant to <em>add</em> a handful of colored glyphs to otherwise black glyphs defined
    in the glyf|CFF table) is shortsighted. It makes things unnecessarily complicated,
    like aksing for an extra mechanism to replaces glyf|CFF-table glyphs by SVG-table
    glyphs.\r\nThat is, besides SFNT-based fonts with glyf|CFF table <em>plus</em>
    SVG table, <em>also</em> include SNFT-based fonts with <em>only</em> an SVG table
    in your scenario.* SVG-only SFNT-based fonts have a few advantages:\r\n<em>\u20131\u2013</em>
    Outline description can be in either cubic or quadratic bezier curves, which allows
    designers to choose and stick to their preferred format.\r\n<em>\u20132\u2013</em>
    And they can make a outline format choice without making an implicit choice between
    CFF or glyf table. SVG format is just some friendly text.\r\n<em>\u20133\u2013</em>
    If there is only one outline description table, GSUB and GPOS can \u2013 as with
    normal glyf/CFF-only fonts \u2013 kick in. You can design a full-color glyph set.
    You can design a mostly black glyph set and a few colored glyphs, and then use
    a Stylistic Set OTL feature to replace default black glyphs by colored alternate
    glyphs. You can design a mostly black glyph set and a few <em>encoded</em> glyphs
    in color (the emoji example) when these are colored by default.\r\n(Ignoring what
    may or may not be considered disadvantages of the SVG format and/or its current
    support.)\r\n\r\nThe pixel vs outline discussion seems pointless. Each serves
    a purpose. Existence of Illustrator/Freehand did not render Photoshop useless,
    nor the other way round.\r\n\r\n* Mr Patel made an interesting remark on the OT
    List (9 July 2011), that an SVG-only SNFT-based font may need another version
    identifier. Which makes me wonder, though, why glyf|CFF-plus-SVG SNFT-based fonts
    are supposed to continue using 0x00010000 or OTTO version identifiers ...\r\n"

  body: "Karsten: <em>The pixel vs outline discussion seems pointless. Each serves

    but Photoshop stores text and geometries internally as vector graphics. Yes, bitmaps
    and vectors each serve a purpose, but the purpose of scalable shapes is better
    served by vectors. Bitmaps are fine if all you need is a couple of discreet sizes
    for screen display at known resolutions, which is Apple's immediate situation
    with regard to emoji support, but I presume they would acknowledge that this doesn't
    constitute the whole picture of multicolour, scalable text.\r\n_____\r\n\r\nI
    agree with you completely re. sfnt fonts with SVG only. It makes no sense to spec
    SVG as a secondary glyph source that also <em>requires</em> a glyf or CFF table,
    although that configuration should be made possible. For fonts that have both
    SVG and another outline table type, I can imagine a dedicated cmap subformat pointing
    to the former for a subset of characters (an analogue would be the format 14 cmap
    for variation selector sequences). An SVG-sfnt savvy app could check this cmap
    first, and render any codepoints assigned in it using the SVG table, and then
    render any remaining characters using the next platform appropriate cmap."

    useful I find Photo<em>Font</em>. As to glyf|CFF-plus-SVG fonts and glyph substitution/mapping,
    Mr&nbsp;Patel's original proposal offered a quite straightforward solution, and
    something similar was discussed on one of the W3 lists (1&nbsp;July 2011). Both
    seem useful \u2013 if implemented as a separate table: Including the glyph substitution/mapping
    mechanism in the SVG table does not make sense because it is unnecessary in SVG-only
    fonts. I am not sure about including adding another subtable to cmap, for a similar
    reason: According to proposals so far, what is needed is mere GID to GID mapping
    rather than codepoint to GID mapping. And according to proposals so far, SVG-glyphs
    are meant to be alternates of glyphs covered in glyf/CFF, which suggests that
    an independent substitution/mapping table is the better choice, e.g. you could
    remove or add SVG table plus substitution/mapping table without need to dissect
    cmap."
