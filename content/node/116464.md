body: I have found this on-line by chance. I don't remember when and where. I was
  wondering if anyone knew the name and history of this font and if anything similar
  with this has been digitized. Thank you[img:sites/default/files/old-images/item_viewer_4320.jpg]

  body: OK, so I have found a high resolution image of the one above through Google
    image search. The image it's on viintage.com and at the bottom of the scan it
    says Fantastic Roman by S. C. Malone, Baltimore, MD. I have uploaded a thumbnail
    also for better view. Does anyone know anything about this? Is this the designer?
    Thank you in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/malone_4114.jpg]
