    the custom face that Carter drew for the Yale identity, based on their long association
    with Bembo.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t remember what he called it. Might just be \u201CYale\u201D
    something-or-other."

    little while ago I did a survey of the fonts used in a number of prominent journals.
    The majority of them use TNR, though Harvard uses Old Style Seven.\r\n\r\nA fun
    fact about Penn's LR (I'm a 1L here): we're using fake small caps and system Baskerville.
    The right font for a school founded by Ben Franklin\u2014just a little botched
    in execution.  "

  body: Carter also designed "Yale Street," a typeface specifically for Yale's exterior
    signs and directionals. Must be nice.
