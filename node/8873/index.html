		<div class="commentbody">Yes, various letters of our alphabet have features in common, and the relationships that these create can be diagrammed by drawing amoebas. But in what sense does this constitute an <i>analysis</i> that needs to be considered in designing a text face? People have been designing text faces for centuries without needing to draw amoebas around groups of letters. It is a pretty image, but it doesn't tell you anything that you can't get in a few seconds by looking at abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. Indeed, I think the amoebas make the relationships more difficult to see: the diagram complicates the simple information it seeks to convey.</div>

I have in other topics agreed with your criticisms - like chastizing Hrant for his all-encompassing use of the word Modernism. You were right to critisize and defend then. But this just sound petty. <BR> <BR>I did not see Hrant make any big deal out of the diagram - he just posted it and I responded saying it was interesitng. I was also looking at it after midnight, so I told Hrant I wanted to look at it more some other time. <BR> <BR>What's the big deal? Who cares how people have been designing faces for centuries? They also relieved themselves outdoors for centuries. Living in the north east US, i am glad that I do not have to be limited to the way it has been done for centuries. <BR> <BR>'nuff said.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mike, Hrant wrote: <i>any text face does need to consider this type of analysis,</i> and I think that sort of claim needs to be considered. I really think Hrant's diagram represents a deliberate complication of something very simple and obvious, in order to make his 'insights' seem esoteric or even radical. And then he insists that text type design requires this kind of 'analysis'. Well I've analysed his diagram, and while it looks very pretty, all it shows is that letters of our alphabet share some features. So what? Any child learning to write gets that in the first week. In what way is this sort of complicated diagram <i>necessary</i> to text typeface design? Hrant has made the claim, but what does it mean? What is the implication for type design practice that Hrant has drawn a line between an <i>a</i> and an <i>e,</i> or between an <i>f</i> and a <i>t?</i> Is there in fact any implication at all? I think these are valid challenges when someone puts forward an elaborate diagram and claims that it represents necessary analysis. <BR> <BR>I did not say that you should be limited to the way things have been done for centuries. But Hrant, by saying that this kind of analysis is <i>needed</i> is certainly imposing limits on what constitutes text typeface design, and anyone who doesn't employ such analysis is doing it wrong. So I ask: what is the analysis? To me, despite the attractiveness of the diagram, the analysis is incredibly shallow: yes, letters share common features. So what? This is neither a mystery nor an insight. I'm all in favour of type designers being analytical. But let's be analytical about claims to analysis also. Analyse the analysis, and don't be taken in by the attractiveness of the diagram.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The closer something I say comes to my alphabet reform work, the more John is likely to exhibit his allergy. In fact that's the defining clause of our relationship. :-/ <BR> <BR>&gt; in what sense does this constitute an <BR>&gt; analysis that needs to be considered <BR>&gt; in designing a text face? <BR> <BR>Because information comes from contrast, and because a text face is a little machine that's supposed to faciliate reading, some formal analysis (if only as a tool and not an end) of alphabetic structures can only help. You of all people should like that!  :-) <BR> <BR>&gt; it doesn't tell you anything that you can't get in a few seconds <BR> <BR>Then I must have an IQ in the teens, since that diagrams took me many weeks of thought. <BR>Or I'm a snake-oil salesman, like you seem to be saying. <BR> <BR>&gt; the diagram complicates the simple information it seeks to convey. <BR> <BR>Well, I don't know what &quot;simple&quot; means here I guess. I don't think it's so simple that you don't need a diagram. And this particular diagram actually has two layers of information: direct letterwise similarities (which pertains to deliberative legibility - think Larson), and bouma-componental similarities (pertaining to immersive reading - see my article in the imminent TYPO #13). A decent grasp of either of those -especially the latter- can't come from merely looking at the alphabet over a sandwich. And in what font? The conclusions (both casual and empirical) certainly depend on what you're looking at, Quadraat or Courier. You look at the chirographic structures underlying the forms? That would naturally limit your insight into <i>reading</i>, thus your ability to benefit from progress in that realm. <BR> <BR>And actually, I think it's one of the few times I've designed a good composition - it presents the tangle of relationships in a clear and pleasing manner. Like how the &quot;cells&quot; are amorphous* I think helps. In fact I remember how after my talk at ATypI-Boston, Lawrence Mirsky of the Cooper Union asked me for a copy of the diagram; but when I asked him if he also wanted the sheet with the MasLucida structures, he politely declined. My tentative conclusion was: here's an accomplished designer who didn't like my end-results, but nonetheless thought that diagram was worth keeping. <BR> <BR>* Not very Modernist, I apologize&hellip; <BR> <BR>The one thing I wonder about though is the density difference, like how the bottom-right has more stuff. Would it be better to have an even gray, or is this skew in fact conducive to better understanding? Sort of like how Hangul has syllables of 4 different densities, and that helps reading. <BR> <BR>And yes, people have been designing fonts for centuries, but: <BR>1) We don't know what people like Fleischman for example (a genius who put a jaw-dropping degree of divergence in some of his designs) did to &quot;formalize&quot; their efforts. We've lost track of the scaling data used by the Bentons less than a century ago - one wonders what else has been lost from giants like Granjon. <BR>2) Let's not discourage people from improving the craft, just because it might reveal limitations in past thought. <BR> <BR>&gt; imposing limits on what constitutes text typeface design <BR> <BR>I think it's important to differentiate between &quot;real&quot; text face design that contributes to culture, and imitative text face design that pleases the creator and the market, but keeps us shackled to the past. Parroting the past is what's shallow - it's a fear of change, of losing one's comfortable supremacy. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you'd simply presented the diagram as 'Here is a nifty thing I've made that groups letters according to their structual relationships', I wouldn't have bothered to say anything. But when you say 'any text face does need to consider this type of analysis' you make two claims: a) that the diagram represents analysis, and b) that this analysis is <i>necessary</i> to text typeface design. I question the first of these claims because something that documents the obvious isn't much of an analysis, no matter how carefully done or how long it takes you. And I question the second claim because it is clearly not the case; at most you can say that some text typeface design might benefit from such analysis, or perhaps consideration is a better word. And I don't accept your distinction between 'real' type design and what the majority of type designers do. Type design <i>is</i> what type designers do, and whatever they do. Your category of 'real' type design reminds me of the kind of perfect capitalism espoused by Ayn Rand's followers, such that whenever one points to any actual historical or current practice of capitalism they say 'Oh, but that's not real capitalism'. I'm very happy, Hrant, that you engage in type design in the way that you do, but I object to your prescriptivism and your frequently insulting dismissal of everyone who disagrees with you or chooses to work in different ways. When you claim that your 'analysis' is necessary to 'real' type design, I think you are being ideological.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; elsewhere in this forum Hrant is vigorously <BR>&gt; criticising ideology as a sound basis for design. <BR> <BR>? <BR>I think you want to put me -and probably everything else- in a neat box, and this is leading you to such incorrect statements. <BR> <BR>I separate &quot;pure&quot; ideology (without which there is no culture) from actual design effort (without which there's no humanity). And I'm not interested in imposing Right and condemning Wrong in the realm of <i>action</i> because we're all fallible human beings. But I'm certainly interested in helping myself and others follow paths that are more conducive to cultural and functional progress in type design. Chirography for example is an ideology that is regressive; this doesn't mean for example that the Underware boys should be burned at the stake; but it does mean that their wasting of potential makes me sad, and I can't just shut up about it. That's all. <BR> <BR>The &quot;a&quot; business is actually a superb angle. Glad to hear about the genesis of Constantia's. When I first saw it it actually crossed my mind that I might have had an influence on it, but it seemed like a long shot - after all many existing fonts (not to mention entire genres of handwriting) have done that for ages. The thing is, I have to think that virtually all of those opted not to have the terminal based on an incorrect ideology. Sure, the results are the same in that case, but a faulty foundation will get you in the end. Like how Ruse <i>does</i> have a terminal; that's just weak apologetics - trying to cover up chirography by giving it a strap-on dildo or something! Perhaps the best example here is Arnhem: its &quot;a&quot; is missing the terminal in the display cut but has it in the text! Talk about one confused cat. <BR> <BR>The reason a weak-top &quot;a&quot; is better for reading is related to bouma divergence. There's really no two ways about it. But this certainly does not mean every text font must have that feature and text fonts without that feature must be verboten! All it means is this: know as a designer, or a user, that this reduces readability. That's all. My Patria for example has some glyphs that are a bit too wide for -what I consider to be- optimal readability. This was a conscious decision, to strike a certain balance of aesthetics and function. <i>That</i> is design; but it certainly doesn't preclude ideology. <BR> <BR>BTW, just to clarify: <BR>1) I never said <i>that particular</i> diagram should be the <i>total</i> basis for any text face. What I said was much broader and gentler: that formal structural analysis -with is certainly aided by such diagrams- is a boon for any text face design effort that aims to improve reading. And what is Craft without the desire for improvement? <BR>2) That diagram isn't based just on my observation and introspection; as I point out in &quot;Improving the Tool&quot; it's also based partly on empirical findings, like those of Ovink, Bouma and Spencer. And it takes a <i>little</i> more than 2 minutes to read and analyze all their work&hellip; <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

Hrant would like to think that his radical ideas upset the status quo, but it is his personality and his treatment of other people that cause large numbers of my colleagues to consider him an offensive crank and a dilletante. This, too, has been pointed out to him numerous times &ndash; most forcibly, I think, by Jan Middendorp, at least in public &ndash;, but Hrant persists in the fantasy that we're all shocked and alarmed by his ideas.

Even on the Spanish color version there is no need for presenting the overlapping sets, as there is already an implied relationship between the letterforms by their location. Having each letter placed next to another and then linked with thick and thin lines is enough to show the various connections. Having the additional sets, especially on the black and white version, just adds noise and makes the diagram hard to read for general non-academic use.</div>

Never giving credit (except to make himself look better), never admitting weakness (except for petty things like buying too many books or liking wine too much or some such cuteness), never admitting to the other side of the coin. Don't bother pointing out for example that Jan and I were back on good terms immediately after that &quot;incident&quot;, that I was right about Typo-L (look at the membership list), that people like Hector exist. It doesn't matter how many people came to my defence when I was excluded from the ATypI list for a month, it doesn't matter how many people want me to give talks and write papers, you're always trying to isolate me and distort my reputation. Weak. <BR> <BR>You think I should be less offensive? I think you are more so, just implictily. At least I'm direct. And many people like me for that - they tell me so. And many people don't like you - they tell me that too. At least I admit they exist on my side. You either don't know about yours, or you simply ignore them, just like you ignore the people who like me, or agree with me*. Admit this duality, that none of us can please everybody, that you're simply hanging out with people who happen to like you, maybe even making undue efforts to cajole them. Admit this not for me, but for yourself. You're not more human than me. <BR> <BR>* Except anybody who dares encourage my alphabet reform work - they don't get ignored, they get attacked!

That's why the title of the diagram has two parts. Two separate diagrams would certainly make each part easier to read, but I think once you get the difference it all becomes more efficient, especially since both parts are important to consider <i>in parallel</i>. It's not a diagram that can be understood without reading up on it - it's a complex and esoteric topic after all - <i>not</i> something that's &quot;obvious&quot;, at least not to a non-genius. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

So I drew a diagram, and from that derived a table: for each letter it shows what might be called the Development Order Class (the roman numerals) as well as which [more] basic letters could provide modules for it. This saved me a lot of time, not to mention exhaustion from imitating a headless chicken. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/georgdev.gif" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/georgdev.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/georgdev.gif</a></a> <BR> <BR>* <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/f_akhalkalak.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/f_akhalkalak.html">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/f_akhalkalak.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>Any writing system -being a system itself- can benefit from such Method, although Latin maybe less.

But that is something quite different from 'analysis' that itself only documents what is obvious. My point about Hrant's diagram is that it doesn't tell you anything new that isn't obvious from looking at the alphabet arranged any other way. It simply restates the obvious in a different and, to my mind, unnecessarily complex way. <BR> <BR>There is an important difference between, as I wrote, 'something that documents the obvious' and something that, if you like, 'deconstructs' the obvious.

		<div class="commentbody">But the idea of 'modules', in your words groupings of letters into colour sets, which represent the components of letters that contribute ambiguity to boumas', is an imposition on top of the obvious data. What the diagram shows is simply the obvious fact that some letters have a modular relationship to other letters. You take it for granted that modularity leads to ambiguity, and so impose this interpretation on the data, but every letter that has a modular relationship to another letter also has a disambiguating feature. Many writing systems work this way (Arabic probably has the most modularity of any alphabetic system), and I've not seen any indication that scripts with less modularity, e.g. Greek, are read with greater speed or accuracy. [This is something that could be measured without most of the usual concerns regarding reading speed tests, since what one would be interested in is relative speed in the same conditions, not absolute speed in preferred conditions. I wonder if we can interest Kevin?]</div>

This precludes for example having a mish-mash of glyphs of different styles; but it doesn't preclude making the top of the &quot;a&quot; weak for example. That's why there's such a thing a too-even-color font, and why constructed fonts have lesser readability than &quot;organic&quot; ones. <BR> <BR>&quot;Sufficient disambiguation&quot; is only relevant in the conscious/deliberative realm, and there you only need the tiniest bit of divergence to ensure leisurely letterwise decipherment.
