  body: "The serif is a Didot for sure. For the sans: I assume I\u2019m overlooking
    something obvious. It\u2019s neither Alpin Gothic nor Alternate Gothic, no condensed
    style of AG, Helvetica, Univers etc. Some more characteristic letters would help.
    Closest I found is <a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/sans/TitlingGothicFB/styles\">Titling
    Gothic</a>.\r\nF"
