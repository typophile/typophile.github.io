body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nEight years ago, my friend and me had got a vision. What about
  using a globe to discover the history of type? Building up a system which works
  like Google Earth, but looks better? Using historical maps instead of satellite
  pictures? Without parking cars when it comes to Gutenberg? Without the highway from
  2011 if we look at Bodoni as it appears in Typomapp?\r\n\r\nDo you know Global Type?
  If not, feel free to visit\r\n\r\nwww.global-type.org\r\n\r\nHere I\u2019ve got
  some examples of how it could look like:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/lars_kaehler/6585510089/in/photostream/\r\n\r\nCan
  you imagine?\r\n\r\nLars\r\n\r\nP.S.: You can find my two talks at ATypI Lisbon
  and Brighton on my website."

    layer of abstraction, some \u201Cneutral\u201D interface, lest you will be willing
    to express dates in sexagesimal cuneiform! ;-)\r\nAlso, how do you represent a
    Bodoni revival done in 2011? With or without highway?"

    different continents?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "A Bodoni revival is a Bodoni revival. Done in its year, so that it doesn\u2019t
    appear if another time interval is chosen. And Bodoni himself created a not endless
    number of different typefaces. They should all be related with his person.\r\nHm
    - type made collaboratively? I think it could be fascinating looking at all these
    points in the years of their releases.\r\nWe are proud to present - I think the
    largest old style and lead and photo typesetting types collection out there! Thanks
    to the work of Mr. Reichardt from Linotype. This is now free."
