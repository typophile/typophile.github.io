  the site with photos, illustrations, and other elements we decided for something
  elegant and type-driven.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look and offer your input. Constructive
  criticism is welcome.\r\n\r\nThe site is [[http://hannahlindroth.org]]\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSheraz "

  body: "Elegant and minimal is always tasty but i am not getting any feel for the
    style of music and i think that may be a problem.\r\nHowever some of it seems
    incomplete or unrefined - particularly the track listings and appearance dates.\r\nAlso
    why is there a seemingly random switch to a serif type for some of it?\r\n\r\nWill"

  body: "I thnk you can still be simple and type-driven while bringing in a simple
    artistic or photographic element for the background. That might allow you to represent
    the type of music a little better. The drawn lines on the homepage (are they light
    beams? not sure) are a little too abstract to mean anything to me. \r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"

  body: 'I definitely second Will insofar as no style being conveyed. When it comes
    to music, you need an emotional connection. You need to show us what this woman
    looks like from the get-go because humans relate to faces and bodies. That is
    my <em>constructive</em> criticism, at least. '
