  It)" campaign by John Lennon and Yoko Ono? I think I heard somewhere that it's Futura,
  but it's not.

  body: '@ebspoony Thank you! Not to pick straws, but I think it''s actually Franklin
    Gothic Extra Condensed. The exclamation point still looks a bit thicker in the
    poster... probably something to do with the digital version of the typeface. Thanks
    again though!'
