  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>How would one go about finding out about relative frequencies of two-letter combinations in different languages* – ideally even discerning between uppercase and lowercase letters? I&rsquo;m essentially looking for something like a list that would say, an &ldquo;r&rdquo; is (I&rsquo;m making this up for the sake of illustration) 13% likely to be followed by an &ldquo;e&rdquo; in English, but only 2% likely to be followed by a &ldquo;k&rdquo;. 
I&rsquo;m aware there will not be a Final Verdict on this to be found, but there must be some approximative data to work with?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m most interested in German and English for the moment.</li>
</ul>
<p>A quick-ish web search has brought up charts with relative <em>single letter</em> frequencies in different languages, as well as <em>word</em> frequency lists, but not a lot about pairs of letters. Wikipedia has a list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram">Bigram Frequencies in the English language</a>, but this is single-case – and also only lists the <em>most common</em> combinations, while I&rsquo;m looking for something more in the vein of a &ldquo;pairing&rdquo; frequency table.</p>
<p>Any good, reasonably reliable references/literature you guys can recommend? 
I&rsquo;m done looking at wonky charts that don&rsquo;t say what data they&rsquo;re based on…
Of course, please re-direct me if this has been discussed before. I couldn&rsquo;t find anything, but then the search has been hiccuping.</p>

I&rsquo;ve found a number of such applets written in different programming languages, but they&rsquo;re always based on a pretty narrow scope of the text you feed into them. I&rsquo;d be more interested in some scientific analyses based on, I don&rsquo;t know, the quantified vocabulary of a given language?</p>

<p>The obvious idea is to feed a vocabulary into one of those &ldquo;applets&rdquo; you saw. Though you probably want to feed a <em>book</em> rather than a <em>vocabulary</em>. That&rsquo;s because latter would have exactly one entry for &ldquo;the&rdquo;, but former will have it aplenty thus severely affecting the counts for &ldquo;th&rdquo; and &ldquo;he&rdquo; &hellip; so it really depends on what exactly you want to measure.</p>
<p>A program that builds a histogram of letter combination probabilities (even if it&rsquo;s case-aware) is really a 5 minutes of work for any decent programmer in virtually any language. Find one, feed one cold beer, collect one &ldquo;lettermeter&rdquo; program.</p>

<p>Ah, I wasn&rsquo;t talking about dictionaries, but about the collective, uh, &ldquo;vocabulary&rdquo; in approximately the sense that Wikipedia says &ldquo;A person&rsquo;s vocabulary is the set of words they are familiar with in a language&rdquo; – only I meant it in a non-subjective way, so a better word would likely be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexis_(linguistics)">lexis</a> (&ldquo;the total bank of words and phrases of a particular language, the artifact of which is known as a lexicon&rdquo;). Sorry about the confusing wording.
Note I did say &ldquo;quantified&rdquo;, to account for frequencies of words.</p>
<p>I suspect that defining and extracting these masses of data is trickier than analysing it, and must have been done before by researchers who knew what they were doing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">From a programmers perspective, it&rsquo;s not that difficult as long as all the texts that are being supplied have the same encoding and as long as such things as line-breaks can be ignored. Remember that ck becomes k-k in German, so just discarding the line-break will not work. On the other hand, you might want to know how often a certain letter is followed or preceded by a linebreak, i.e. a hyphen. Different spaces are also rather difficult if you are interested in characteres at the beginning and the end of words. A rough estimate, however, should be not to difficult to obtain in C or even TeX. As for the sources, I&rsquo;d try to find large chunks of text on the internet. (The quantified lexis of books might be more important than the overall quantified lexis of the language, as I assume the purpose is related to typography.) Ghostview can also extract plain text from PDFs. &ndash; cs</div>

I guess I&rsquo;ve spent too much time studying that collating &ldquo;something, just a lot of text&rdquo; myself would not feel like a hack job (and not enough time to actually do it myself, satisfactorily). Maybe I put too much trust in research, but I do feel this needs a basis that&rsquo;s thought through in a way.
Like, what&rsquo;s in the Gutenberg project? It won&rsquo;t have daily newspapers. Words used are highly context specific, which is one reason why I think the Brown corpus is (or was?) doing a pretty good job of collating different language usage contexts.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I’m assuming that you are using this to single out kerning pairs?&quot;</em>
Um, not yet. It was something that crossed my mind when I started thinking about spacing more seriously, which is also premature for me, but highly interesting. (Like wanting to know how often on average an &ldquo;r&rdquo; would be followed by a &ldquo;round glyph&rdquo; vs. a straight.)</p>

<p>Your dedication is admirable. But I have to ask: Would it really matter how often an &ldquo;r&rdquo; is followed by round vs. straight? Won&rsquo;t you want both combinations to look acceptable and well-spaced?</p>
<p>There was a time when disk space and processing time were at more of a premium and there was a point of diminishing returns for adding kerning pairs for unlikely (or practically non-existent) combinations. But things have changed quite a bit in the past several years. Also, with class kerning capabilities in OpenType, these frequency issues are much less important considerations, it seems to me.</p>

<p><em>The freely-searchable 385+ million word Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) is the largest corpus of American English currently available, and the only publicly-available corpus of American English to contain a wide array of texts from a number of genres&hellip;.</p>
<p>The corpus is composed of more than 385 million words in more than 150,000 texts, including 20 million words each year from 1990-2008. For each year (and therefore overall, as well), the corpus is evenly divided between the five genres of spoken, fiction, popular magazines, newspapers, and academic journals. The texts come from a variety of sources:</p>
<p>Spoken: (79 million words) Transcripts of unscripted conversation from nearly 150 different TV and radio programs.</p>
<p>Fiction: (75 million words) Short stories and plays from literary magazines, children’s magazines, popular magazines, first chapters of first edition books 1990-present, and movie scripts.</p>
<p>Popular Magazines: (81 million words) Nearly 100 different magazines, with a good mix (overall, and by year) between specific domains (news, health, home and gardening, women, financial, religion, sports, etc).</p>
<p>Newspapers: (76 million words) Ten newspapers from across the US, with a good mix between different sections of the newspapers, such as local news, opinion, sports, financial, etc.</p>
<p>Academic Journals: (76 million words) Nearly 100 different peer-reviewed journals. These were selected to cover the entire range of the Library of Congress classification system.</em></p>
<p>For your purposes you probably wouldn&rsquo;t want the spoken words, but they can easily be filitered out.

<em>&ldquo;Your dedication is admirable. But I have to ask: Would it really matter how often an “r” is followed by round vs. straight? Won’t you want both combinations to look acceptable and well-spaced?&quot;</em>
Indeed I&rsquo;m probably off on kind of a longish-term learning tangent here, rather than aiming for an actual, quick, tangible result that I&rsquo;m then going to put to use in my font. 
This curiosity about the frequency of letter combinations (especially regarding the &ldquo;r&rdquo; example mentioned) also wasn&rsquo;t triggered by thinking about kerning, but rather the lettershapes themselves. In different fonts, the &ldquo;r&rdquo; – not due to spacing/kerning, but judging from the shape of the arm/beak – seems to go especially well with subsequent round shapes; or it has particular problems with an &ldquo;a&rdquo; following it; or it may look too close to an &ldquo;m&rdquo; when followed by an &ldquo;n&rdquo;, etc.; that made me wonder which combinations would be most important to consider in an &ldquo;r&rdquo; (&amp; I&rsquo;m assuming there must be similar considerations considering other glyphs as well).
Of course I agree the goal has to be to make it look decent at the very least next to as close to &ldquo;anything&rdquo; as possible – but I&rsquo;m wondering if there is one especially frequent pattern of combination that would take precedence due to its frequency.</p>
<p>AtoZ: Thank you! That&rsquo;s awesome. I was wondering if the Brown corpus isn&rsquo;t somewhat out of date by now.</p>
