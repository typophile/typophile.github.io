  body: "Thanks for the ID.\r\n\r\nI really like many House fonts. Since they are
    always bundled with so many other fonts I don't want, I've never actually purchased
    a House Industries font package."

  body: Like Veer and others who sell only font packages, I believe their goal is
    to be the sort of retailer that makes $200 sales rather than $20 sales, even if
    it means losing a few $20 sales along the way. It's worked out quite well for
    them.
