  body: "I believe this is custom. It's Art Deco-ish, but I cannot find anything that
    is even very close. If I was trying to reproduce it I think I'd start with <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/humanist-521/\">Gill Sans Condensed
    (Humanist 521 is Bitstream version)</a>. I'd tweak the R proportions, then use
    the 8 to make the E, and borrow the S from a font like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/casablanca/\">Casablanca
    Condensed</a>.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    http://www.flickr.com/photos/melsatcs/3232492495/sizes/o/in/photostream/) maintaining
    the \"mirrored 3\" Es, it\u2019s surely a custom job.\r\nMike\u2019s suggestions
    are sound.\r\nFor some strange reason, it reminds me of the recently released
    Lorimer (http://www.typophile.com/node/78056). A much more modern feeling typeface
    with a similar E is Panefresco (http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/panefresco)."

  body: "Hey thanks guys... Definitely think Gill Sans Condensed fits the bill for
    most similar, broadly speaking. Backwards 3s &/or bisected 8s for the Es. \r\n\r\nRiccardo:
    I think you are likely right that this is custom, the client i am helping just
    wants something that is similar rather than exact repro, so all your suggestions
    have been super useful. \r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\nAlex"
