In stunning developments a formerly obscure group of type fanatics have asserted themselves in the public arena.
Standing in front of the Washington monument, Chris Lozos has announced he will be running for President. When asked why he said that he hasn’t heard a single pun from any of the other candidates in either party. Challenged on his qualifications, Chris argued that anybody could do better than the current guy.
In a related development Hrant Papazian has been annointed King of Armenia. King Hrant’s first act was to declare that there will never be another election in Armenia, as he intended to save his country from the pitiable fate of Los Angeles, California.
In Beirut, Lebanon, John Hudson announced his conversion to Islam, and has been appointed chief negotiator to reconcile Hezbollah and the government of Israel. Speaking through a translator, Hudson explained that Arabic is much more elegant than his former Church’s blackletter, and the Lebanese food is much better than the English fare he is used to. The government said that for anybody who can draw both Arabic and Hebrew, the negotiation ought to be easy.
Simon Daniels, at Microsoft, reported these developments on his ‘Type News’, but added that they don’t matter, as the nation-state is finished, and actually Bill Gates rules the world. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>On another note, William Berkson burned all of his refernce material so that he can prove he has committed every quote on Earth to memory [except the ones not printed in Caslon].
Further news just in: Vincent Connaire in a surprising announcement, swore off photographing beautiful women forever. He said it was just too boring and was going to focus his new-found energies on taking pictures of socks being darned.

<div class=commentbody>This just in from CNN! Tiffany Wardle was recorded as swearing a blue streak even sailors would be too embarassed to utter. The outburst was in response to the U.S. Supreme Courts recent banning of the EULA as a legal document. Tiffany was quotes as saying to the Chief Justice:
"@#$%%#@&&**###@@%!!!"

Thomas Phinney's response was, "It'll be on my blog in a few weeks."
Yves Peters could not be reached for comment because Sabine had locked up his laptop until May.

<div class=commentbody>Adam Twardoch announced at a Sunday brunch for the printing press that the soon to be released new manual for FontLab Studio will be set in FF-Mt in a space saving move. Customers were complaining about the huge volume of pages that were almost indecipherable for the current manual. Twardoch was quoted as saying, "The new manual will now be so compact that it will fit on the head of a pin!" Twardoch later added: "Customers will be happy not only for the size reduction of the FL5 manual but that it will still remain unintelligible as ever."

<div class=commentbody>Correspondent Allyson Zaner reported that a volcano erupted creating new Hawaiian Island, The island named “Wikikahuna” burst from the pacific rim last Sunday as Hawaiian huntsman watched in amazement. “Hundreds of clyphs were formed in flourishes of lava.” Zaner reported. Zaner, a native Californian, was forced to write her report on her old Remington Typewriter because of power outages caused by Wikikahuna’s eruption. Aftershocks were heard as far as Arizona and the glowing sky was seen as far as Reading England.
