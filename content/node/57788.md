body: "So, I've created the first two pieces in a five part series of mailers. The
  pieces all use a two-color black plus silver tritone to reproduce black & white
  photography, spot red ink, a gloss aqueous coating over the top of all of it (they
  are self-mailers). The 2nd in the series is being bid out with a tinted varnish
  pattern as well.\r\n\r\nOriginally, we were going to use an emboss and silver ink
  technique to simulate duct tape on one of the mailers, a die cut on yet another,
  but the client has decided that the mailers must be closed with glue dots, which
  ate up our production budget with postage costs, sort of leaving me in a creative
  lurch on mailers 3-5.\r\n\r\nSo, I am reaching out to you guys to get some suggestions
  for cheap production techniques that might add a little sparkle and wow to these
  pieces without running up a huge budget increase. We're already at 5 colors with
  the varnish, so I don't think we can add more colors, and the form factor is already
  fixed, so we can't alter that (fold in half self mailer sealed with four glue dots).\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

  body: Does it really need four glue dots? I do a ton of fold-in-half stuff, and
    I've never needed four. You might want to check with your mailhouse to make sure.
    I can usually get away with one wafer seal.
