body: My first &#42;proper&#42; sans-serif. I have been labouring through the night,
  driven by a surge of adrenalin brought about by a university acceptance. So here
  it is... Dent ... at least most of teh characters. s,u,v,w,x,y,z are still to be
  done in lc. no uc have yet been done. Am I doing everything wrong here? It is basically
  a fusion of gill, verdana and others. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2877.gif"

  body: ' Hi matthew <BR> <BR>a good start i would say... <BR>Look at the &#39;c&#39;,
    the width of the bowl is bigger than the bowl of the &#39;d&#39;. Is it the same
    stem-width as the. <BR> <BR>The horizontal stem of the &#39;f&#39; and &#39;t&#39;
    is to short in my opinion. BTW: the angel of the &#39;t&#39; down-stroke and the
    &#39;f&#39; up-stroke looks very different to the others round shapes. &#40;dont
    need to be the same... maybe it is only my own flavor&#41; <BR> <BR>The &#39;n&#39;
    needed a little improvement at the left stem. <BR> <BR>&#39;d&#39; where the bowl
    go in to the stem looks round at the punch but linear a the outside &#40;hope
    you understand what i mean&#41; <BR> <BR>The &#39;m&#39; is to small <BR> <BR>okay
    hope this helps a little <BR> <BR>Greetings Jens '

  body: ' Very nice start. Reminds me a lot of Bernhardt &#40;Agfa&#41; or Bernhard
    &#40;Font Company&#41;. I think overall your spacing is a little tight. &#40;Although
    you probably aren&#39;t addressing spacing just yet.&#41;  I agree with the remarks
    made by Jens overall. It looks as if you are designing a monolinear design, but
    I think the main vertical strokes on all the characters &#40;which have them&#41;
    would benefit from a little modulation. I&#39;m interested to see your version
    of UC for this style of face. Post soon? '

  body: 'Jens... having not benefited from an eductaion in typography of any kind,
    your remarks at first were slightly confusing. But it doesn&#39;t take a genius
    to decipher most of what you say.  <BR>&#62;Look at the &#39;c&#39;, the width
    of the bowl is bigger than the bowl of the &#39;d&#39; <BR> <BR>yup, noticed that.
    have corrected. <BR>&#62;The horizontal stem of the &#39;f&#39; and &#39;t&#39;
    is to short in my opinion <BR> <BR>I was unduly influenced by a common newspaper
    font in England here. You are right. <BR> <BR>&#62;BTW: the angel of the &#39;t&#39;
    down-stroke <BR> <BR>Am I right in thinking you meant to say &#34;angle&#34;?
    <BR> <BR>anyway, will fix the &#39;m&#39; and &#39;n&#39;. I can see what you
    mean about the &#39;d&#39; in the gif, but in fontographer it seems OK. strange.
    <BR> <BR>anyway, here is the font so far.. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2879.gif"

    go on: :-&#41; <BR>&#39;m&#39; and &#39;s&#39; you saw by yourself... but look
    where the bowl meet the stem and compare/make it similar to the &#39;n&#39; &#40;the
    same to the &#39;r&#39;&#41;. The &#39;s&#39; seems to be mirrored. You can do
    this I guess but I would try to do something like this: <BR>&#40;simulation&#41;

    <BR> <BR>The width of &#39;v&#39;, &#39;x&#39; and &#39;z&#39; is to big, inverse
    the &#39;w&#39; is to small. <BR>Flavor: the middle stroke of the w maybe have
    to go up to the x-height <BR> <BR>The horizontal line of the &#39;e&#39; need
    improvement. Also the &#39;down&#39;bowl as not smooth <BR> <BR>BTW: Please dont
    care about the typography name I make, maybe they are wrong.. <BR> <BR>Greetings
    Jens <BR>BTW: wich university is it where you will go? And wich &#39;course&#39;?'

    <BR>The font: my main problem is that many of the curves have &#34;wobbly&#34;
    contours; like in the bowl of the &#34;b&#34;, the top is heavy, the right way
    too light, and the bottom a little too light. Compare with the &#34;c&#34;, which
    is mostly solid, but much darker too. Also, make the &#34;m&#34; like the &#34;n&#34;.
