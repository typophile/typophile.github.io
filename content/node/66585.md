  could not defend, typefoundries and others are allocated space to publish press
  releases. Seriously: Don\u2019t they have their own Web sites?\r\n\r\nThere is an
  argument \u2013 marginal at best \u2013 that Typophile is the place to go to find
  typographic news, so such news should be published here. Let\u2019s imagine that
  argument held water. What\u2019s the argument against opening up those press releases
  to comments? Why are comments disabled on such posts?\r\n\r\nAlso, the so-called
  \u201Cmoderators\u201D of this site must go out of their way to publish, in a prominent
  and stable location, the exact criteria that are used to accept or reject a press
  release or similar pure-marketing postings."

  body: Such press releases should perhaps only be posted / allowed in the Release
    forum? That would meet all the criteria posted by Joe. Perhaps a set of guidelines
    could be provided showing what can an cannot be included in a thread on the Release
    forum (maybe even just as a stickied thread in said forum). I agree that blatant
    advertisement isn't necessarily to be desired, but I do think the argument of
    finding typographic news holds water.
