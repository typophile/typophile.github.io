  body: Chris, I don't know what the normal or standard OT feature code for fractions
    is. Some time ago I tried to get it working and took a look at a few Adobe Pro
    fonts, but I really couldn't figure out how they scripted it.

    for the enduser but adds a Tad more work for the type desighner :-)\r\nIt is really
    cool that someone doing a cookbook can, in less time than it takes to flip an
    egg, impose the frac feature with the aid of a stylesheet! Goitta love Tal's work.
    That is one Leming I would surely follow!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "What I don\u2019t like about the frac feature like this is that the space
    will be removed. I think it\u2019s the designer who decides how the fractions
    must look like, not the typeface. I mean with or without the space in front of
    the fraction.\r\n\r\nPieter"

  body: True and a good point, but the feature is off by default and can also be applied
    on a selection if you want (you don't need the space) so the designer stays in
    control.

  body: "@<strong>Jos</strong>: \"<em>I don\u2019t know what the normal or standard
    OT feature code for fractions is</em>\"\r\n\r\nQuite simplified, this is the way
    I do fractions (<em>follows the description, then the code itself</em>). Derived
    of Adobe standards, of course. This is a working code I only re-edit to alter
    the exact figures naming. Depending on the availability of five sixths, four fifths
    and other [more exotic] fractions you can remove parts of the replacement code
    below.\r\n\r\nSo, <strong>the explanation</strong>.\r\nRequirements: 0-9.numerators,
    0-9.denominators\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Define what is considered slash (as class);\r\n<li>Define
    already built fractions (like percent, onequarter, onehalf etc.);\r\n<li>Replace
    all standard figures with numerators;\r\n<li>Define replacement rules for the
    already built fractions;\r\n<li>Last part: generation of not-ready fractions (like
    22/7 etc.)\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<em>feature frac {\r\n\t@slash = [slash fraction];\r\n\t@prebuilt

    part is it does not need in fact any editing (you can copy and paste this feature
    code everywhere, if you have defined the classes <strong>@fig_dnom</strong> [denominators]
    and <strong>@fig_numr</strong> [numerators]). Of course Tal's solution is nicer,
    but this one is easier - and does not have above-mentioned shortcomings (namely,
    the space problem)."
