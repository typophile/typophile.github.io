  easy I may just do it myself but if I am out of my depth I would like to have a
  list of folks to refer this client to. \r\n\r\nHrant, - do you have time?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    domain, and the couple of Hebrew fonts I did a while back were cheesy imitative
    efforts, so you don't want me doing this, especially since there seem to be like
    half a dozen actual Hebrew type designers here. Just give them a few hours to
    wake up.\r\n\r\nOh, and no, I don't have time either.  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    in Tel Aviv. If you're looking for a North American based company you could do
    worse than Ascender (they've done Hebrew work), John Hudson of course, and I think
    Monotype Imaging have Hebrew expert on staff. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: "Thanks for all the answers! Now I can pass this on if I need to for sure.\r\n\r\nI
    finally got the font to look at it. The font is a terrible mess because it was
    made from auto-tracing. In order to spare the company involved I won't name the
    foundry ( if you can call it that ) or the 'designer'. In fairness, it is probably
    a small market. Think how hard it is to sell a font for english use? \r\n\r\nI
    have a couple of questions:\r\n\r\n- For future reference what Hebrew fonts are
    actually well made?\r\n\r\n- Some hebrew specific questions: When You have a daled
    with a sh'va & a dagesh (dot) the sh'va should still be centered under the leg
    or descender of the daled right? What about the size of the sh'va? Should it become
    smaller when there is a daled - or stay the same size? \r\n\r\n"

    body: "IMHO the best Hebrew fonts are made by Fontbit in Israel. www.fontbit.co.il.\r\nIf
      you need a font fixed up, then it depends what you need. If you need the outlines
      cleaned up, then you should contact Fontbit. If you have outlines and you need
      the font converted for Opentype (including nikud) then the expert is Arieh Marzel.
      If you need to contact him, then get in touch with me off-line since he doesn't
      like his contact details posted online for obvious reasons."

    Contact me off-list and I'll get you a less complex model font with VOLT sources.

    \ in modern times some of the most well received and most used text fonts have
    been Frank-Ruehl, Hadasa, David and Narkis. You can see many, many at <a href=\"http://www.masterfont.co.il/web_articles_show_e.php?article_id=1\">Masterfont's
    web site</a>\r\n\r\nThe names are listed in Hebrew script, though.  "
