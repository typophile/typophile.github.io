I only    <BR>did then part of the lowercase set &#40;the easier glyphs ;&#41;,   <BR>and five or six UC letters. Recently, I&#39;ve come across    <BR>these files again and wondered if it would be worth the    <BR>trouble to revive and complete them.    <BR>   <BR>What do you think?   <BR>   <BR>   <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6871.gif" alt="karolehard.gif">   <BR>   <BR>There were three versions, which I&#39;m calling <i>hard</i>,    <BR><i>soft</i> and <i>sharp</i>. The <i>hard</i> version was the less    <BR>incomplete, so it&#39;s the only one I&#39;m displaying here.    <BR>The <i>soft</i> version would naturally be the one more    <BR>appropriate for text &#40;well, would it?&#41;. I compare   <BR>the three below.   <BR>   <BR>   <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6872.gif" alt="karoletrio.gif">   <BR>   <BR>   <BR>The <i>soft</i> version is of course the most difficult and    <BR>demanding. I had a vision of how it should be, but    <BR>haven&#39;t been competent enough to do it back then    <BR>&#40;or rather I didn&#39;t invest the necessary time on it&#41;.    <BR>But I guess <i>sharp</i> was the sexiest baby to me. ;&#41;   <BR>   <BR>   <BR>   <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6873.gif" alt="karolesharp.gif">   <BR>   <BR>   <BR>General or specific comments are welcome.   <BR>   <BR>Thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rodolfo, this is very nice - although I do have a weakness for semi-serifs. There&#39;s a bit of Unger, a bit of Granjon, and a bit of Times in there. But the result is totally original. <BR> <BR>I won&#39;t go into specific glyphs &#40;yet&#41;. What I&#39;d point out is that I think you need to make some text versus display decisions here &#40;as you&#39;re already prepared to do, it seems&#41;. For example, the Sharp and the Hard are very well suited to display work &#40;at large and moderate sizes, respectively&#41;, so the narrowness is right on. I agree that the color and contrast of the Soft make it the most suitable for text &#40;while maintaining that rigidity I for one find priceless&#41;, but there the degree of narrowness will act against readability too much. <BR> <BR>The other thing I&#39;d point out is that you&#39;re <i>mostly</i> avoiding the classic problem with semi-serifs: backslant. The delicacy of your serifs helps. But do consider putting slight swells&#42; on the other sides of the semi-serifs, especially in the display cuts. <BR> <BR>&#42; But definitely not mushy ones like in Avance. Look at FF Profile, or maybe Proforma. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; But the drill work involved in making a complete face bores me big time. <BR> <BR>Some font houses are willing to apply their in-house designers towards the completion of a promising font, although your cut of any profits would go down. <BR> <BR>&#62; You know I like Times, don&#39;t you? <BR> <BR>I like it too, but only for display. <BR> <BR>&#62; Smeijers&#39;s theory <BR> <BR>It doesn&#39;t make sense, because we read boumas, and that relies on tight spacing. Loose spacing is in fact the main weakness in Eureka and Rotis. Smeijers might be talking about very small sizes? There greater letterspacing is indeed more important, but so is large apparent size: if you save horizontal space through narrowness, you&#39;ll need to make it up through a larger point size. <BR> <BR>The general view concerning narrowness is that it causes a drop in legibility through decreased decipherability of individual letters, but that&#39;s also misguided. The real problem is two-fold: <BR>1&#41; Bouma decipherability relies heavily on the overall width of the silhouette, and narrowness causes a decrease in the absolute difference of width in the lexicon of boumas. In the parafovea, the best way to tell apart &#34;dearly&#34; and &#34;dastardly&#34; for example is through their width primarily &#40;and the second &#34;d&#34;&#39;s ascender secondarily&#41;. <BR>2&#41; Too much narrowness also puts a given bouma too far outside familiarity. <BR> <BR>BTW, do you think Patria is wide or narrow? <BR>You might be surprised that it&#39;s more economical than Times... The trick is the massive counters. On the other hand, that has a certain bad effect in the subvisible realm. <BR> <BR>&#62; mostly with flat-foot half-serifs <BR> <BR>Wouldn&#39;t serifs rotated counter-clockwise actually cause <i>more</i> of a problem? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

Roman relies in large part    <BR>on the baseline for stability and balance. You can call that static    <BR>equilibrium. Italics, on the other hand, has a sort of &#34;dynamic    <BR>equilibrium&#34; &#40;isn&#39;t this perhaps the most important difference between    <BR>them?&#41;, even though it&#39;s of course also sitting on a virtual baseline.    <BR>When you have a &#34;flat-foot&#34; &#40;roman&#41; half-serif it seems as if the glyph&#39;s    <BR>center of gravity isn&#39;t quite supported by the base and it tends to fall.    <BR>The same effect doesn&#39;t happen in a &#34;carolingian&#34; half-serif as the base    <BR>is not what supports it to begin with. Also the serifs angle provide a  <BR>sort of southwest-northeast thrust to the stems that helps to keep   <BR>them afloat.    <BR>   <BR>BTW, this kind of investigation was one of my interests here.</div>

The danger is that -as he progresses- he might find such faulty theories subduing his original good direction. Which is exactly what happened with Dwiggins: he thought extenders contributed nothing to readability &#40;which he was apparently confusing with legibilty&#41;, so he never made anything better than his early Electra. &#34;Things are at their best in their beginning&#34; - Pascal. <BR> <BR>&#62; ....

I like the contrast   <BR>when the shapes, instead of acknowledging the pen, suddenly seem   <BR>to acknowledge the brush &#40;thus annoying Hrant even more ;&#41;.   <BR>   <BR><i>i looked at it again, and now i realize that hard k seems very    <BR>different &#40;the arms&#39; proportions&#41; from sharp k. i think sharp k    <BR>is ok. but hard k still bothers me: doesn&#39;t it look too wide in    <BR>&#34;ikko tanaka&#34;?</i>   <BR>   <BR>Maybe, Eduardo - isn&#39;t that an image artifact? I think it&#39;s more or    <BR>less the same. The &#34;sharp&#34; version is lighter, in any case.   <BR>   <BR>It seems that this k is somewhat polemic. Just to give the due    <BR>credit: its design is partly derived from the famous gala portrait    <BR>of Louis XIV by Hyacinthe Rigaud. Look it up and you&#39;ll see how.  ;&#41;</div>
