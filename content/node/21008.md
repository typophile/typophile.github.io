  body: "To be more exact, it is the Multiple Master version of Adobe Jenson. The
    \"S\" character depicted gives it away. The OpenType \"Pro\" version doesn't appear
    to have quite the \"slabs\" as the MM version in smaller optical sizes.\r\n\r\nPlaying
    around with the MM slider, my guess is the sample resides somewhere around 500wt,
    12op."

  body: "This brings up an issue that I have wondered for some time now. I remember
    using OS9 on the Mac, the Multiple Master fonts were recognized and usable. From
    what I understand OSX no longer supports this. Correct? I have many of the Adobe
    fonts as MM, but OSX does not recognize them. Am I required to boot into OS9 if
    I want to continue using or is there a third party solution?\r\n\r\nI am not a
    Windows person, does XP support MM fonts? I don't have the PC versions, but I
    am curious."

  body: "Windows XP on its own does not recognize multiple master fonts. You have
    to install Adobe Type Manager 4.1 \"lite\" or \"deluxe\" in order to use them.\r\n\r\nOne
    workaround is using FontLab or Fontographer to open an existing MM typeface in
    a desired instance and generate that as a fixed typeface.\r\n\r\nIMHO, I think
    it is a mistake to simply abandon the MM format. It's a shame it did not catch
    on better. So many people out there have this sickening need to distort type and
    graphics. The MM format is the only thing I've seen to attempt to counteract that.
    I miss the MM slider feature in older versions of Adobe Illustrator."
