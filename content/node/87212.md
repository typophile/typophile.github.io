  think \xABS\xBB, \xAB&\xBB and \xABA\xBB are set in Eurostile.\r\nBut what about
  the rest?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nGiorgio"

    Please restore it to its original self, don\u2019t spread the pirated version."

  body: "Technically, it shouldn\u2019t be defined as a \u201Cpirated version\u201D
    (no more than H&FJ\u2018s Forza, for example).\r\nYes, the letters are probably
    modelled after Eurostile\u2019s ones. But it lacks the signature superellipse
    curves of Novarese\u2019s typeface, making it more akin to the countless geometric
    \u201Cfuturistic\u201D fonts out there, albeit a particularly bad one.\r\nAll
    that said, this Acena is a really fugly font. And it should be avoided whenever
    possible."
