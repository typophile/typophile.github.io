  body: "Mario, \r\n\r\nEach of these should be a separate thread. It's too hard to
    know which have been answered. Usually when I see a thread with three or four
    posts, I don't bother to look at it, because I think it must have been answered.
    In this case, all the posts were you putting up new samples.\r\n\r\nNo fair.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as ID's I don't recognize any of them, but I would bet the first one is a
    freebie font you would find at a place like Dafont. \r\n\r\nI just looked and
    it's <a  href=\"http://www.dafont.com/vtc-embrace.font?fpp=50&text=ANCIENT+CREATION\">VTC
    Embrace</a>, a freebie at Dafont.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
