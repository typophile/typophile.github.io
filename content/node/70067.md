  FontShop Facebook photo</a>, the FontShop profile asks the following question:\r\n\r\n\"<em>Quick
  Poll: Facebook has introduced a way to include their \"Like\" buttons on other websites.
  Should we add them to FontShop.com pages so you can show your love for your favorite
  typefaces?</em>\"\r\n\r\nI say no for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It will create
  another piece of information to process, digest, enter &c. when looking for fonts.\r\n\r\n2.
  People will find a way to game the system to put more \"likes\" on fonts.\r\n\r\n3.
  It will perpetuate the success of already successful typefaces and put newcomers
  at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\n4. \"Like\" is so subjective that it's useless information.
  Typefaces should be selected based upon fitness for purpose, not weather you, or
  anyone else \"like's\" them.\r\n\r\nIF implemented, users should be required to
  provide a valid reason. This reason will then need to be moderated and accepted
  (= hours of work) because people will simply say \"just because.\" Just because
  McDonalds sells a lot of hamburgers doesn't make them \"good.\"\r\n\r\nCast your
  vote by becoming a fan of the FontShop profile and then commenting on the question."

    of them. However, there are many who feel like sharing their favorite type on
    their social network of choice sounds like a nice feature and responded that way.\r\n\r\nJohn
    - I'm very sensitive to these issues and I assure you we'll take them into account
    when considering any use of their service. This is very exploratory at this point."

    from within their social network of choice, without the need for other people
    browsing fonts to see a button which, in fact, is an ad for a specific social
    network."

    trivial at all.\r\n\r\nit's data-collection, for the purpose of collaborative
    filtering.\r\n\r\ncollaborative filtering is the _ultimate_ \"killer app\", because\r\nit
    solves the ever-growing problem of information overload,\r\npulling your personal
    needles out of the content haystack,\r\nas quickly and efficiently as a super-turbo-charged
    magnet.\r\n\r\nthe big question is whether we want this \"killer\" functionality\r\ntied
    up by a private company looking for a revenue-stream,\r\nespecially one which
    values neither our privacy nor our data,\r\nand has been slippy-slidey when it
    comes to telling us that...\r\n\r\ni say no.  emphatically.\r\n\r\nthis technology

    backlash has really been gaining momentum lately, I'd warn that including that
    \xABlike\xBB button can also be perceived, quite negatively, as a statement of
    solidarity with a company that more and more people turn away from. See for instance
    this current comment \u2013 http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/05/facebook-rogue/
    \u2013 which specifically mentions the \xABlike\xBB button \xABlittering the internet\xBB."
