  body: I tried setting the same thing in Corel Draw and it seems to be kerning AV
    and VA but I'm confused...there is an AV pair in the kern table but no VA. I'm
    guessing kerning is being done elsewhere? Where is it being set if not in kern
    table?

  body: "Calibri and the other MS ClearType fonts were originally made with GPOS kerning
    only. When MS Office decided to adopt some of these fonts as defaults, they requested
    that kern tables be added, since Office apps did not yet -- and still do not!
    -- support GPOS kerning for European scripts. The kern tables contain filtered
    flattened kerning from the GPOS sources, including only encoded glyphs; even so,
    the size of some of the kern tables is very large, and it is quite possible that
    apps might fail to support all the kern pairs.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'd recommend
    against including both GPOS and kern table kerning, unless a client specifically
    requests it and has some pressing technical need."

  body: "<cite>Michel, you completely lost me after your second post!</cite>\r\n\r\nWell,
    when I look with FontForge, it first tells me that there is a kern table but I
    also get the message that it will not read it because there is also a kern feature
    in GPOS.  If I generate the corresponding afm file, I get 34863 kerning pairs
    (taken from GPOS).\r\n\r\nTo force FontForge to read the kern table, I remove
    the GPOS table from Calibri with \"sfntedit -d GPOS Calibri.ttf\" and generate
    again the afm file. This time I get the 14148 kerning pairs of the old style kern
    table plus a warning that the kern table does not comply with the specs. \r\n\r\nThe
    rest was simply to find more precisely the cheat, or the bug, or at least the
    reason why ttx would output only 3225 pairs with first glyph from A to Ograve.
    \r\n\r\nMichel\r\n\r\nEDIT: According to the spec, the subtable should be 19366
    bytes long and there is just one. It starts with 14 bytes of info and then there
    is 6 bytes per kerning pair. (19366 - 14) / 6 = 3225. After that, ttx stops decompiling."

  body: "The basic issue is that the ancient kern table spec uses a USHORT for the
    'length' field (for the length of the entire kern table including all subtables).
    Why it was specified this way is a complete mystery to me, since the length of
    the entire *table* is already given by the font's Table Directory (header). It's
    not even redundant, since the Table Directory length is a ULONG, allowing for
    a much larger table. But that's how it is.\r\n\r\nSo, for tools or other processes
    that make use of the length field, you can do the math with the table & subtable
    header lengths, etc. and figure out that the number of pairs in a format 0 subtable
    is theoretically limited by that field to a maximum of 10920 (which I'm sure the
    inventors thought would be more than enough at the time, but nowadays, not so
    much).\r\n\r\nBut, many tools and some operating systems ignore or at least don't
    choke on kern tables where the length field is not correct, and can calculate
    the actual length of a format 0 subtable by using 'nPairs' field."

    is that the GPOS kern feature has been removed from the font and all the kerning
    pairs put in an old style kern table. On that table spot crashes, ttx and FontLab
    do not do their best to circumvent the hack. The only solution I see is to open
    the font with FontForge, generate anew the ttf, and open the resulting font with
    FontLab. You should then see all the kerning pairs.
