    to tell me, which family this kind of typography belongs to, it would be very
    helpful. And perhaps some useful information about it. \r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cassiophoto.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/jbs-underwear-nurse-original-17214.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    objectifying sexist advertising? That ad is NOT okay in any fucking way.

  body: "<blockquote>So you are most sure that the JBS logo is Coolvetica ?</blockquote>\r\nNope,
    never said that. I said Coolvetica is the closest solution I've found which could
    do the job as it (meaning without any modification) but it's far from a perfect
    match. Actually, I don't understand the purpose behind trying to know which exact
    font it could be. Almost all logos are custom, in this case rather say \"customization
    of a commercial type\". To me, this one is a customization based on [[http://myfonts.us/td-IwWLux|Helvetica
    Neue]] Medium (or Chalet), started with \"gbs\" as backbone mainly removing /g
    counter and adding an ascender and a rounded dot. And FYI, Coolvetica stands for
    Cool(Hel)vetica :)\r\nAnd if you need an exact match to recreate this logo and
    work with it, better go with the vector logo I've pointed to..."

  body: 'Who said that I will recreate the logo? When working with a commercial like
    this, I look at the visual and typographical elements and analyze them objectively.
    So I can''t see why your''e opinion is important in this context. '
