    eaglefonts site has marked this font as commercial (not free)\r\nand the crown
    unfortunately looks like a low quality bitmap.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar one in
    \ <strong>Monarchbats</strong>, letter /g/ which seems to be free and the crown
    is in vector format:\r\nhttp://www.eaglefonts.com/monarchbats-ttf-149766.htm\r\n"
