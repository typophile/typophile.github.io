		<div class="commentbody"><p>Font Family.</p>
<p>Maybe one of the very first font families in the modern sense of the term was Frutiger&rsquo;s Univers. The weight of Univers wasn&rsquo;t italic - roman - bold, but in the currently often used ultra light, light, roman, bold, black, extra (with an oblique version of each weight).</p>
<p>But seeing the example I think that you may intend the most modern concept of the extended (my own words!!) font family, which is a collection of fonts in different weights and in different styles.
Examples: Stone family features Stone Serif, Stone Sans, Stone Informal etc. Agfa Rotis family features Serif, Semiserif, Semisans and Sans. Officina features Officina Sans and Officina Serif.
As the work to create such a range of weights and styles is very huge this kind of extended font families started to arise in the latest development of font design, when it expanded into a huge team work rather than solo work, which was quite like the &lsquo;old school&rsquo; of font design.
As much as the what, who and when are said, still remains the why? It&rsquo;s simply to avoid troubles in font matching.
With such a comprehensive font family you may cover all the font functionalities you need in a typographic work without the trouble of studying a font pairing (which is IMHO still one of the best and most useful typographic activities to sharpen the typographer&rsquo;s mind). In fact these families are like a collection of different fonts designed with their pairing as the supreme guideline.
This should avoid troubles when working with multiple fonts but a careful study is still required as the context and the needed design may need further adjustements.
And also remember that some great fonts are only a weight and they&rsquo;re still kicking ass. This means not to refer to the font family extension as a measure of quality. You should prefer a single weight font designed like heaven than a huge family of crap.</p>
<p>Feel free to correct and/or to discard my opinions as I&rsquo;m still a young type student..</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Steve, Frank&rsquo;s answer is correct. Early printing types were designed to look like the handwritten letters they replaced, so the strokes are thick where a right-handed scribe would use the broad edge of a broad-nibbed pen, and narrow where he&rsquo;d use the narrow edge of the pen. 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/m800_italic_manual_5070.jpg]
You can see this contrast in old-style types like Garamond. As letterforms evolved from the 15th to the 19th century, the contrast between thick and thin became stylized and exaggerated in faces like Didot and Bodoni.</div>

I just want to know if there is a name for when 1 character (e.g. &lsquo;A&rsquo;) that has different weights across the 2 stems (left thin and right thick).</p>
<p>Thanks for your response.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In the wiki link on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Panose classification<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it is said that the contrast &ldquo;describes the ratio between the thickest and narrowest points on the letter &lsquo;O.&rsquo; The uppercase &lsquo;O&rsquo; is used because it is generally of higher contrast than the other characters of the alphabet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a more precise definition in Haralambous' book &ldquo;Fonts &amp; Encodings&rdquo;, page 431
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/contrast_6506.jpg]
It is the ratio between min(c,d) and max(a,b) where min(c,d) is the smallest value between the widths c and d, and max(a,b) is the largest value between the widths a and b.</p>
<p>Also in the wiki link there is this definition: &ldquo;Stroke Variation: It specifies the relationship between the thicknesses of the thin stems and the wide stems. It further details the contrast trait by describing the kind of transition that occurs as the stem thickness changes on rounded glyph shapes.&rdquo; I thin Haralambous puts it more clearly, saying that with stroke variation &ldquo;we are concerned with the more or less rapid way in which a stroke changes from one thickness to another&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So, my guess is that what you have in mind is really the contrast.</p>
