  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have been searching for a quote (or quotes) on how difficult it can be to design or visualize something but so far my finding have not been quite what I m looking for, I was wondering if anyone here of the top of the head would know one?</p>
<p>Thanks alot</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You think of book, or theory quotes?Maybe you should narrow your search, general visualization is maybe too abstract. What do you want to visualize?</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, In 2 years currently doing BA in design, there was no general formula on how to visualize something - answer was research, research, research.</p>
<p>Probably ton of books were written on this subject.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@ James, YES! Why didn&rsquo;t I think of that?</p>
<p>@ Ravel, its not that I m having trouble visulising this particular piece of work, I have but it was difficult to do it in the end, well do it in a different and hopefully more interesting way, so I was looking for a quote to insert into it to compliment it as I went around in a less then usual way.</p>
<p>To be more clear, I built the LHC out of house hold goods. So I have a photograph of it, and I want quote to put into that&rsquo;s about how hard it can be to visulise/design something, hope thats more clear?</p>
<p>The four that I have that sort of work are</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ldquo;Visualize this thing that you want, see it, feel it, believe in it. Make your mental blue print, and begin to build.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert Collier&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Incredibly complex systems turn out to be governed by few and very easily comprehensible rules, where the complexity is totally invisible until the system is examined as a whole&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We favor the simple expression of the complex thought. We are for the large shape because it has the impact of the unequivocal&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes we needed no words at all, but merely shared the flow of imagery in our two minds&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks alot</p>
