  Volt. I  encountered a problem with one of my characters uni065F. It is a below
  \ mark and is used in combination with other characters. i set its positioning in
  volt and type as mark  but when i test it in microsoft word it creates  joining
  problem for the character with which it is used. it does not let the character with
  which it is used to join with successive character. Any help would be a great help.
  thanks"
