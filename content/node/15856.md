    Software, has been discontinued and is no longer available for purchase.  The
    company went out of business in 2001.</cite>\r\n\r\nAlso, it gets mentioned in
    the <a href=\"http://www.t26.com/about/help.php\" target=\"new\">T-26 FAQ</a>:\r\n\r\n<cite><strong>Whatever
    happened to that old, scripty Jim Marcus font \"Aquiline\"?</strong>\r\nI think
    I saw Aquiline sitting on a bench in Wicker Park asking underage passersby for
    a tissue. It won't be coming back to T26, and for this we are deeply sorry. Dirty
    vagrants are such fun with all their worn-out jokes and tired sob stories about
    bus fare by which they tug at your purse strings! But hey... let bygones be bygones.</cite>"

    which at first glance on screen looks similar to the original. I hope this isn't
    genuine piracy here, expect it'll get moderated if it is.\r\nTim"

    yet, due to lack of hard facts... :^/

  body: "Just for reference, our font Allegheny does bear some resemblance to Aquiline,
    but is not the same.  Having seen and liked Aquiline I set out to design a similar
    font, likely following a process not much different from how Aquiline itself was
    designed, using samples of 17th century calligraphy in a similar style (see our
    Orford font) and rendering a rougher and more casual variation, admittedly aping
    some of the character variations in Aquiline, while adding other unique variations.\r\n\r\nThere
    is no point in ripping off a font when you can reimagine it and hopefully make
    it better, or at least more to your personal taste.\r\n\r\nDave"
