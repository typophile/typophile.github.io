  to discover which font would best meet a particular design need I've run into. What
  a cool site. \r\n\r\nQuestion:\r\n\r\nI'm resetting a pamphlet published in 1883:
  William Smith on Mormonism. \r\n\r\nIt was printed in Lamoni, Iowa (at Herald Steam
  Book and Job Office), as I said, in 1883. \r\n\r\nWhile I have access to the text,
  I have been unable to locate any images of the actual document. \r\n\r\nWithout
  that, I have no idea what font was actually used. While I'd love to know, I'd settle
  for at least setting it in a historically-tenable font.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have
  suggestions?\r\n\r\nMuch thanks for your time and help, folks. \r\n\r\nChris \r\n\r\n"

  body: "While it is from a slightly earlier time, Monticello would be appropriate,
    and better, I think, than Walbaum or Bodoni for the time, place, & content.\r\n\r\nMatthew
    Carter made the PostScript version of Monticello for Princeton University Press,
    as it had been used in their Thoreau series. This was done in partnership with
    Linotype as they had done some preliminary digitization.\r\n\r\nThe fonts are
    available from Carter & Cone, or I believe Linotype. The C&C has all the goodies,
    but as it is a Type 1 font, they're spread out across multiple fonts. Monticello
    is essentially the same as <cite>Oxford</cite>, and could be thought of as a Scotch."

    Use a didone like HTF Didot or Bodoni 72 for the titling, and you've got a nice,
    historically-appropriate design I would think.\r\n\r\nI agree that while DeVinne
    is nice, it is too light for most applications; yet another casualty of the early
    digitization era.\r\n\r\nI would imagine Font Bureau's FB Scotch is nice, but
    I haven't seen it anywhere other than their pdf specimen sheet.\r\n"

  body: John, I got a bit carried away with adding characters to my Scotch. It didn't
    seem like such a big deal ramping up one font to 1500+, but it's a bit of a grind
    finishing the family--haven't got around to the Asian Cyrillic Bold Italic Swash
    Caps yet--and I do intend to release the whole family together.

    the link to the 1800's Emphemera page, jupiter. \r\n\r\nI'm mulling over my options.
    \r\n\r\nTo thicken the plot, I tracked down a couple of scanned pages from an
    acquaintance in Hawaii. He's now uploaded them to his website. For whatever interest
    it might hold, the links are:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.olivercowdery.com/smithhome/BroBill/1883-02.jpg\r\nhttp://www.olivercowdery.com/smithhome/BroBill/1883-03.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm
    going to post these to the Type ID forum and hope for the best. At least then
    I'll know the identity of the font(s) to which I don't have access. \r\n\r\nThe
    body-text font doesn't seem *particularly* distinctive, at least in my fairly-uninformed
    opinion, other than the upper-case \"J.\" But the title-font surely must be identifiable
    from a mile away if one has the right set of eyes. \r\n\r\nAgain, thanks much
    for the help. \r\n\r\nChris"

    \r\n\r\nOldstyle #7 is a Linotype face. Credited to the Bruce Foundry, 1902. I
    don't have reference material here so cannot check more. Adobe sells it, and until
    just now looking at MyFonts I had never known that Bitstream has something called
    Bruce Old Style that is very similar, but appears to be lighter.\r\n\r\nI rarely
    use Oldstyle #7, but there are times when it is just right.\r\n\r\npowers"

    call up this era is with ITC Bodoni Twelve, which has all the bells and whistles
    you will need, especially oldstyle figures. It is really outstanding.
