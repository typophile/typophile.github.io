  the one used for the words \"original oxford marmalade\" in the pic. I assume the
  lettering is a unique design for the brand, but it's a pretty common style (or at
  least was back in the day!) so there must be something similar out there. Doesn't
  necessarily need the shadowing, more interested in the letter shape etc.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/marmalade_5780.jpg]"
