  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

I haven't posted here for a while, good to be back. I just want to throw a bit of a curveball really, it's a logo I'm working on  for part of my own business; related to design and print. I don't want to say too much as i'd like some feedback, first impressions, initial thoughts. It's essentially a sketch so any comments on design and polishing up would be great, though I'm just looking for feedback on what impression this letterform gives. It's the first time I've tackled any sort of weird script like this and, to be honest, I'm not sure wether to progress.

Many thanks for your thoughts!
J

If you press me, I could probably see a Greek restaurant in it too. 

But it certainly a very unique logo. Not bad or good, just odd. Virtually no strong associations ... which is actually good, because you can bind it to any association you want with a simple tagline.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The dark patches make it a bit special. But that means the "t", "e" and two "el"s need that too.

One legibility problem: that last "a" is quite likely to be read as an "s" (even with the first obviously-an-"a" instance).

		<div class="commentbody">Cheers Hrant. Didn't think about the "a" problem. Colour needs sorting out yes. I might play and re post it.

Awkward terminals make the x-height nearly impossible to define too, as you'll probably notice. Hmm..</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Note that since it's a logo, a letter doesn't always have to look the same; the second "a" can be different than the first – although in that case I would make the two "s"s a bit different as well. Just make sure such variance makes sense for the subject.

BTW, the x-height is generally over-rated.

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, I initially had the last A going right down on the down stroke, as far as a descender almost, with the horizontal/ strike through more a aggregated too. Might go back to it. I had also drawn the second S larger but the whole thing was just messy that way.

I can see myself going almost full circle to the original drawing here!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I first read "Kisstells". It took a bit to realize the last letter is an /a, and it took far longer for me to realize that in that case the second letter is also an /a.

I quite like the style, but I think you're thinking too much of typefaces. I agree with Hrant the x-height might not be so important here. I like the /k. I think I would look at this logo like a handmade script and bring more variety to the letter shapes and flow.

As for associations, I find it difficult to say anything about this, but if I have to I would say it reminds me of stitch work which tries to become a graphic element or typeface.  I'm aware they're not mutually exclusive, but then associations aren't always rational. Either way, I think you have a good starting point here but you probably shouldn't be too conscious of the rules of typography. During the design process I wouldn't think of this logo too much as a typeface because that might be limiting in its forms.</div>
