  after purchasing Helvetica for their documents.\r\n\r\nSilly question, but does
  anyone have any experience of charitable discounts for fonts?\r\nAnd as money /is/
  tight here, where would you purchase from anyway? And finally, what would you consider
  to be a \"bare minimum\" for a family of Helvetica, as there's no way they could
  afford the $1000+ for the full suite.\r\n\r\nI'll leave you all alone now... :)\r\n\r\nn"

  body: Do they really need the complete family for their documents? The entire family
    is huge! I guess a lot of money could be saved by just licensing only the necessary
    weights.

    already gave the answer yourself, it comes bundled with Mac OS X :) Of which you
    can find second hand copies. But a single-user licence may not be enough for use
    in an organization."

    discounts, as I'm a kind of whore I just give 10%, but in the description, MyFonts
    says that the usual range is between 15-40%.\r\n\r\nMaybe you should take a look
    there."
