  sample.  This is a signboard from a British ocean liner circa 1910-1920.  The first
  line is a rather distinctive decorative font.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/fontnotice.jpg\r\n\r\nYour
  help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n   Ralph"

    drawn but was hoping I could find a fairly close typeface.  You've at least given
    me something to start with.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n   Ralph"
