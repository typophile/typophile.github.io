  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">A friend and I went to hear Steven Heller speak at California College of the Arts tonight, without any prior knowledge of the topic of his lecture. Heller's interests slew all over the map, but most of the reason I was interested in hearing him speak had to do with <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4077/17238.html?1072731339">this old thread</a>, which has caused me to do a certain degree of muttering about him to my friends. (I'm in the throes of blackletter mania right now, you see. Or at least Rudolf Koch mania.) <BR> <BR>As it turns out, that thread's perfect prep material for the lecture we saw, which concerned the uses of design within 20th century totalitarian regimes. As it turns out, it was a lively, fascinating, and only occasionally irritating lecture about Nazi Germani, fascist Italy, Mao's China, and the Soviet Union. There's no question Heller's a popularizer (anytime he started straying onto topics where I had some expertise, his arguments started to sound facile), but he presented a lot of interesting material I hadn't seen before. <BR> <BR>He did repeat his potted history of how the Nazis used &quot;volksschrift&quot; (i.e. blackletter) as part of their totalitarian &quot;brand&quot;, and once again he neglected to mention how the Nazis eventually rejected blackletter, just as they'd rejected modernism in the first place. I think I only noticed that because I was looking for it (just like I only noticed that he misidentified a schwabacher script as a fraktur because I was just studying the differences last night). <BR> <BR>What comes through in his lecture was how much more effective the Nazis were at creating a unified &quot;brand identity&quot; than any of the other groups. He spent a lot of time presenting materials from the</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Forrest, thanks for the firsthand account. <BR> <BR>&gt; came across as a bit snide or triumphalist.  <BR> <BR>Indeed. <BR>A superset of Heller's flawed stance on the Swastika, blacketter, and anything that the Nazis happened to touch is his blind partisanship of the West, and condemnation of anything that tries to fight the tyrannies of the ascendant JudeoChristian establishment. By distracting us from the fascism of our <i>present</i> age, he's basically an agent for the powers that be. <BR> <BR>In a past issue of Print he had a short piece about alleged similarities between the UN logo and the old Soviet crest. And we know what the US and Israel think of the UN&hellip; In that piece Heller uses classic local news innuendo, as well as phrases like &quot;evil Soviets&quot; with a straight face. Disgusting. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; The real extraction of blackletter <BR>&gt; from public life came after 1945 <BR> <BR>And most significantly to us today, the contemporary vilification of fraktur comes from those who have the most to gain from perpetuating the remembrance of Nazi attrocities, the most to gain from brandishing something to hate. That would be OK if they were still the underdogs, but that's no longer the case. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; all arguments that attempt to tie particular <BR>&gt; forms to particular ideologies are flawed. <BR> <BR>Eternally, yes, that's not possible. But treating forms are shapes devoid of cultural context is just as naive. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

I'm not aware of any organized political, social, business, or industrial movement attempting to keep fraktur out of the public sphere. In my experience, what keeps it out of sight and out of mind has been personal, individual gut reactions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not saying there's a conspiracy. I'm saying that some people -yes, individuals- with certain political agendas use whatever is in their field (in Heller's case, a symbol, a typestyle) as tools to further those agendas. Some people do it as a &quot;reflex&quot; of sorts, others do it concertedly - but the result is that the &quot;abused tool&quot; suffers, through no fault of its own, and hence people who'd like to use that tool for good (like you and me) suffer too. <BR> <BR>Fraktur is a doberman, that has simply switched abusive masters. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; On the contrary, there is much overlap between Nazi neoclassicism and modernism, witness the architecture of Albert Speer: big and plain.  <BR> <BR>I would never claim that any artistic development happens in a vacuum; I was discussing the modernists' aspirations more than reality. <BR> <BR>Speer's work reminds me of those 18th century designs for monumental mausoleums. Stasis and heaviness are built into the architecture so strongly that I really wonder how he expected people to live with his designs over the long term. Even Nazis, who presumably thought that sort of thing was cool. <BR> <BR>&gt; Coolhunter Hitler. There is no absolute bond between the folky-blackletter-German idea of Kultur, and Nazi political power. As the wind turns, so does the creative director. <BR> <BR>Good phrase, and accurate too. All I'm saying is based on the evidence I've seen, blackletter held onto its role in articulating the visual identity of Nazism to the public of the Reich for what seems to be the duration of their rule, regardless of Hitler's edicts. Given time, I'm sure Hitler would have moved them on to something else, but he didn't have that kind of time. <BR> <BR>&gt; I'm saying that some people -yes, individuals- with certain political agendas use whatever is in their field (in Heller's case, a symbol, a typestyle) as tools to further those agendas. <BR> <BR>I really think it's unfair to pile all this baggage onto Steven Heller. There's a certain broadness to his moral judgments and a kind of blithe &quot;America #1!&quot; attitude in how he discusses the Soviets, but it's not like he's some kind of SECRET ZIONIST VINDICATOR. He's just a Jewish New York art director who likes being a Jewish New York art director, which makes it entirely logical and not really axe-grinding that he has problems with totalitarian regimes, anti-Semitism, and Stalinism. I mean, accusing the art director of the New York Times as being a tool of the establishment is not picking a very tough fight. <BR> <BR>Picking on blackletter as a visual symbol of Nazism is a bit of a facile (and unfair) judgment, but as Dan keeps saying, in the grand scheme of things, it's really not Heller who's keeping blackletter down.</div>
