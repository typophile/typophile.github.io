  have a copy of this slab serif font called Shattuck, but the only information I
  have on it is \"Copyright 1994 Novelfonts! Corporation\". NovelFonts is a foundry
  that doesn't exist anymore, and it seems like their business model was to release
  copycat fonts under slightly different names than the original. I'm having trouble
  finding the name of the original or its equivalent. \r\n\r\nI found a misleading
  match in the Solotype Catalog which calls this face \"Schadow Antiqua Bold Condensed\"
  but googling that name is a dead-end; URW Schadow Antiqua is definitely not the
  same font. Identifont.com didn't get a match, either.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\n\r\n//john"

    Black Condensed</a>. There are some slight differences.

  body: Actually, I think the exact font is "OPTI SchadowAntiqua" from Castcraft.
    The Bitstream font is more bold and not as condensed.

  body: "I'd be careful about using Opti fonts as a standard for naming, because the
    fact is that most of their fonts have alias names, though not all. I think the
    Jaspert 'Encyclopaedia of Type Faces' is a better authority, and it shows 'Schadow
    Bold Condensed' as identical to Shattuck, as far as I can see.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
