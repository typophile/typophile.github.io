  body: "I have been looking at all the connected scripts I can find with this 'nameplate'
    style, like a number by Leslie Cabarga for Font Bureau, and I haven't found any
    with these letterforms. I think the shark-fin curves at the letter tops and on
    the initials shows a custom design for this logo. \"RISING\" might be something
    so distorted it would be hard to pick out, even if it were a font, but I think
    Great White is custom lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
