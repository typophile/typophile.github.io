  body: Thought it could have been [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik|Graphik]]
    until I've seen [[http://nodeberlin.com/archive/fall-out|the digits]]. If they
    come from from the same typeface, that could not be Graphik. They're closer to
    some [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/|Bitstream version of Futura]]
    (to get this kind of cut on [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/bold/glyphs.html#glyphs/243667/20|1]]).
