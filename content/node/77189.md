    extreme weights (Thin and Black)?\r\n\r\nIt would have been a lot of work, the
    Thin requiring much delicate drawing, and the Black being awkward to design/draw.
    And I reason that those weights would rarely if ever be licensed or used by designers.\r\n\r\n<em>
    Why are there no small caps, fractions, superiors and inferiors, in the Thin,
    Extra Light and Black weights?\r\n\r\nAgain, it would have been a lot of work,
    which I don't believe would ever have been used. These are \"expert\" features
    used in body text, so are not required in display weights.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWas
    I correct in my assumptions?\r\nIs there no call for Thin italic or Black small
    caps?"

  body: "This truly is a beautiful piece of work.\r\n\r\nMy only question is in regards
    to pricing.  I see on myfonts it is currently $245 with the promotion and $350
    without it.\r\n\r\nWith the lack of weights/styles what justifies the pricing
    when I could purchase Archer with 25 Styles for $280 and get all the weights that
    weren't created for Bodoni Egyptienne or even spend $50 more when the Bodoni promotion
    ends and get all 40 styles of archer for $400.\r\n\r\n14 styles of Bodoni Egyptienne
    for $245\r\n25 styles of Archer for $280\r\n\r\nIt makes it hard to consider Bodoni
    when I am getting 11 additional weights for $35 with Archer.\r\n\r\nI only bring
    this up because I am currently very seriously considering this purchase myself
    and I am having to decide between the two.  When I hear a designer say \"it would
    have been a lot of work\", this makes me questions the overall integrity of the
    font.  I am not so sure HFJ said the same thing when designing Archer and is this
    evidenced by the weights/styles available.  It may be easier for me to justify
    spending that $35 and going with Archer even though this is such a new and beautiful
    font."

    utility. Rather than skimping on features and styles in some weights, please think

    superiors &c.) in Extended Latin encodings, 700 glyphs per font\u2014which is
    comparable to many such similarly loaded contemporary typefaces. The display weights
    (without small caps, &c.) also have the Extended Latin encoding, and the four
    basic sets of figures (tabular/proportional/lining/oldstyle), 280 glyphs for $39,
    the same price the original Type 1/TrueType Bodoni Egyptian sold for, which had
    only basic Western encoding and no figure alternates, just over 200 characters
    per font. \r\n\r\nThe full family at $349 for 8 weights of roman, 14 fonts in
