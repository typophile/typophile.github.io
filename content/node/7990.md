  body: On another forum, people suggested  <BR> <BR>perhaps &#34;Script&#34; or &#34;Ford
    Script&#34; <BR> <BR>or <BR> <BR>for &#34;country&#34; try Tabitha aka Hudson

    alt="Tabitha"> <BR> <BR>This seems to be the same, but I&#39;m unable to find
    an example of the entire font somewhere online, just to check it out. <BR> <BR>any
    ideas? <BR>And many thanks for the answers!

  body: Umm ... a version of Hudson is what I pointed you to above. <BR>No, it&#39;s
    NOT the same, but with country very possibly being <BR>hand drawn, it may be as
    close as you&#39;ll get in a font. $2 <BR>would be a paltry sum to check it out,
    no?

  body: Ok, many many thanks for the information. <BR>Just to point out, I don&#39;t
    need the font itself, I only needed to identificate it. <BR> <BR>anyway, I&#39;ve
    come up with some more questions. <BR>I&#39;m fairly new to the font identification
    and these ones come up with something totally rediculous in identifont and something
    not quite right in whatthefont. <BR> <BR>I guess they are fairly easy ones. <BR>
