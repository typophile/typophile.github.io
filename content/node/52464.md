  long time I loved the lowercase 'g' and then the lowercase 'j.' There was a brief
  period when I was all about the interrobang but that was short-lived.\r\nDoes anyone
  else love the ampersand?"

    are flawed, I do indeed love it.\r\n\r\nThe \"el\" is the village idiot of the
    Latin alphabet - it needs a brain transplant.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
