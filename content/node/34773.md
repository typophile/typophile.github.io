  like \"Rolling Stone\"\r\n\r\nThis album art has what I'm specifically looking for:\r\nhttp://www.sanctuaryrecords.co.uk/product/images/SMETD190.jpg\r\n\r\nNotice
  the ornate initial caps.\r\n\r\nthis link also has some interesting faces:\r\nhttp://www.sanctuaryrecords.co.uk/product/images/CMKTD997.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm
  currently using Algerian. It works, but I'd prefer something with lowercase letters.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help.\r\n-sellitti"
