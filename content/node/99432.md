body: "Hi guys!\r\n\r\nSo I'm a graphic design student, and I'm interested in designing
  Japanese Typefaces. Since I don't have the budget to purchase the Asian Fontlab
  (and since I foresee type design as a hobby versus a profession) I've been considering
  purchasing TypeTool so I can do basic type editing. I noticed that it has the option
  of using 65,000 glyphs, so I think it would probably serve my needs.\r\n\r\nMy TypeTool
  question is, is it possible to make fonts in TypeTool that react to the usual input
  method of Japanese characters? For example, I don't want \"k\" to represent a single
  character- I want to type \"ka\" and have the corresponding characters \u304B, \u30AB,
  \u706B, \u79D1, \u5BB6, etc etc appear. as options. I've been doing some researching,
  but I'm unfamiliar with the terms associated with this input method.\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much!"

    or desktop environment, or is third-party software which integrates into such.
    \ (Windows IME, ATOK, SCIM-IM, Anthy, Wnn, etc. are all examples.)\r\n\r\nAll
    you need to worry about is adding the Japanese glyphs to the font at the correct
    codepoints.  That is certainly possible in TypeTool.\r\n\r\nBTW you should be
    able to create at least a minimalist Japanese font in FL5, as common-use characters
    (Joyo kanji plus kana plus Latin) only take about 2200 slots.  There are a number
    of Japanese fonts out there which do this.  It doesn't come close to complete
    JIS-X-0208 coverage, of course, but it'd be OK for most everyday purposes."

  body: Thanks so much! I may splurge at get FL one day, but I need to decide whether
    or not it's something I want to commit to one day- knowing that I'll be able to
    attempt the basics in TypeTool is a big help!
