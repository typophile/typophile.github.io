  the font used in the title. It's the perspective I believe that's throwing me off.
  \r\n\r\nDoes anyone recognize the font used in the word 'wrestling'?\r\n\r\nAny
  help is greatly appreciated , and I do thank you in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Image0_5956.jpg]"

  body: You might look at the Kabel family, the "R" and the "G" are probably the easiest
    characters to use for doing matches.

  body: "Thanks fontgeek , but the Kabel family doesn't work at all. :( \r\n\r\nI
    wish I had a better image to use , but even at a larger size , the source is still
    from a std. tv resolution. \r\n\r\nMost notable are the letters 'G' , like you
    mentioned , but also if you can make it out , the letter 'A' has straight sides
    and a curved top. \r\n\r\nWould there be any other families worth looking into
    to possibly find a match?\r\n\r\nThank you again.\r\n\r\n "

    for WRESTLING.\r\nWith the round A, Superstars looks a little like something from
    Emigr\xE9's Base Nine.\r\n"
