  I was ready to generate and start testing I hit a \"snag\". It wasn't a snag really,
  just a question about hinting. Is it really important with the advances in screen
  technologies nowadays? \r\n\r\nI've looked around online and even read a few manuals
  and all signs point to yes however most of these articles that give you tutorial
  advice on hinting haven't been updated since 1998. And I'm sure advances in screen
  resolution and type rendering have moved on since then. \r\n\r\nSo the question
  still remains... How important is hinting to typeface design and production now?"

    who will be using them to set running text on obsolete platforms like Microsoft
    operating systems that still use hinting to make text legible. Otherwise just
    learn to set up your blue zones and stem values and let the Adobe autohinter do
    the rest."

  body: I have a feeling that higher PPI screens will make hinting obsolete within
    a few years.

  body: Well, screens coming out last year were up to 250 ppi. With the rate of technological
    advancements, we'll see that go up pretty quickly.
