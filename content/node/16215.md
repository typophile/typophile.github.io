  in Dutch. Online translation services haven't been much help. Here is what they
  wrote:\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_ben op zoek naar de vertaling van de naam senne\r\n\r\nSo
  far, the best(?) translation I've managed is this:\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_be in search
  of the translation of the name senne\r\n\r\nI think they want something from my
  site translated into Dutch. Hard to say. So much for technology."

  body: Your translation is close, they want the name senne to be translated into
    Dutch (doesn't make sense to me, though).

    knowing the context I think it's a bit strange that they ask you in Dutch to translate
    something in Dutch)"

  body: "Senne is a Dutch name, ancient, kind of Friesian (ambiguous in the sense
    that a lot of Friesian first names are used for boys AND girls. Eg my mom is called
    \u201CKlaasje\u201D, which is the diminutive of Klaas (aka Charles).) I haven't
    seen this name a lot...\r\nFull translation:\r\nI am looking for the translation
    of the name Senne."

    hear back from this person.
