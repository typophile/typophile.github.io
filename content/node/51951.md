  over the internet and am not finding the answer.  I have a project due by the end
  of the semester on the significance happenings of ITC in 1978.  I am shocked by
  the lack of history on ITC on the net and at the library.  Can anyone help me out
  or point me in the right direction.  I found articles of it's founders' bigraphies
  but nothing specififc to 1978.\r\nThank you!"

    popular U&lc magazine. If you look at issues from 1978, well, then you're homework
    would probably be done! You'd just have to filter out a few of the awesome, interesting
    things that would be listed on its pages.

    publications.  It is where we started.  Thank you though.

    your local AIGA and Art Director\u2019s Club to see if there are any local history
    buffs who have old sets of U&LC. In a city as big as Memphis somebody must have
    a set.\r\n\u2022Take a road trip to a library that does have the magazines. \r\n\u2022Work
    with your school or local librarian to get copies sent out via inter-library loan."
