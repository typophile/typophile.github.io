    suspect that, even though phototypesetting was around in 1954, this book was set
    in metal type. That fact, coupled with the use of an uncoated paper stock, makes
    the type appear much thicker/bolder than you'll see in the current digital version.\r\n\r\nYou
    can always use Bodoni Antiqua Medium and Medium italic to replicate the effect."

  body: Thanks, but I'm not sure it's Antiqua because it has a cut-off ascender on
    't', unlike the pointy curve of Antiqua.
