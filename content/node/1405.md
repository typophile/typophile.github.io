body: Hello,  I had been trying to make some print&#39;s on Mac OS 9.2 and the kerning
  of the letters are always lost. I always generate a postscript type 1, bitmaps and
  the AFM files but nothing is appear. But in same time everything works on other
  computer &#40;Mac OS 8.5.1&#41; which all kening tables are visible and activate
  on screen and print. I use Fontographer 4.1.5 and Suitcase 8.2 on &#40;Mac 9.2&#41;
  but I don&#39;t know if this software version are adapted to this recent Mac OS
  versions. I would like to understand better where and why that this problem starts.
  I hope my questions are simple to understand. Thank&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Ricardo
