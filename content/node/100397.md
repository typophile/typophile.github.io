body: Elena is an attractive font for mobile devices, but I am curious how it works
  for printed output for books or papers. It seems to have a nice italic, and many
  of the classic typefaces have only fair (Baskerville, minion, documenta) or poor
  (old style 7) italic fonts. I personally like quadraat, dolly, and mercury, And
  trinite italics. Since I have only seen Elena on an iPad, I do not know how it would
  work in print. Thanks.

  body: "I'm not sure what they do now. They used to give out a high quality bitmapped
    pdf version of their fonts and they would send you a printed copy if you asked
    or purchased a different set of typefaces. That was about six years ago, and I
    haven't purchased anything from them recently. The image above is in Elena, but
    is roughly the text they used in their Collis display (except for my typos).\r\n\r\nTheir
    type is not only pricy, but they (like DTL) have very few opentype pro versions
    of their fonts. As far as I know, none of their fonts can be embedded legally
    in a pdf. For that reason, I have trinit\xE9, which has no equivalent, but have
    only printouts of their other type designs."

  body: "Printing the pdf helped some, but I purchased it and am pleased. It has a
    generous x-height but on printout is something like Collis. (I have printed specimens
    of collis from Ensched\xE9 but do not own the fonts). It seems to work best as
    a book font around 11/14.5. \r\n<a href=\"http://s1297.beta.photobucket.com/user/IsleofGough/media/Elena_zps01241ab2.jpg.html\"

  body: Elena is very nice. The only problem I have with it is the lack of true  superiors
    or superscript. As academic and research texts use to have several footnotes,
    this is a major failure to my needs.
