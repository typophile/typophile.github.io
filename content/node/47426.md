  lighter weight.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions greatly appreciated?"

    You might have to consider trying to create a faux-SC look with a different serif
    family. If you use the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|search
    page of the Serif Font ID Guide]] and type 'swash' into the fuzzy search window
    at the bottom, it should show you all the fonts I have catalogued with Roman and/or
    Italic swash faces. Use the '...click for more:' button to see what form of swashes
    are included. (Hmmm. Interestingly, Hoefler Text is not shown with that property,
    and I will need to fix the database. However, 53 other families are listed.)\r\n\r\n-
