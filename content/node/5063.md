body: 'We were disappointed, but not surprised, that Erik Spiekermann, a noted and
  respected type designer and author, would knowingly make false and misleading statements
  regarding Berthold in a public forum. <BR> <BR>As such statements affect the reputation
  of Berthold Types, I am responding with this posting. I attach a letter dated June
  3, 2004, to Mr. Spiekermann explaining the actual facts behind the continuation
  of H. Berthold&#39;s type business by Berthold Types. This letter is from Berthold
  Types Limited&#39;s German attorneys because the subject matter involves German
  law. We arranged for the attached English translation. <BR> <BR>Although the letter
  to Mr. Spiekermann addresses the myths and misconceptions perpetuated by Mr. Spiekermann&#39;s
  comments, I would like to make a few points: <BR> <BR>1. Berthold Designers <BR>Mr.
  Spiekermann states that Berthold Types has no contracts with any of the original
  Berthold designers even though he is well aware of the agreement with Guenter Gerhard
  Lange.  Mr. Spiekermann, a friend of Mr. Lange, tried to persuade Mr. Lange against
  working with Berthold Types but failed. <BR> <BR>Contrary to Mr. Spiekermann&#39;s
  statement, Berthold Types has agreements with Guenter Gerhard Lange, Bernd Moellenstaedt,
  Dieter Hofrichter, Orjan Nordling and Prof. Werner Schneider.  <BR> <BR>--Mr. Lange
  &#40;at 83&#41; is working on new typefaces for Berthold Types; having completed
  Whittingham in 2001 and additions to his other typefaces &#40;Bodoni Old Face and
  Imago&#41;. He also has a new typeface yet to be released and has embarked on another
  large typeface project for Berthold Types. Mr. Lange as artistic consultant is actively
  involved in future type releases by Berthold. <BR> <BR>--Mr. Moellenstaedt has created
  a new, large typeface family for Berthold Types &#40;yet to be released&#41; as
  well as preparing additional offerings of Formata. <BR> <BR>--Prof. Schneider recently
  completed and Berthold Types released his Senatus typeface. <BR> <BR>--Mr. Hofrichter
  works on many projects for Berthold&#39;s type program and works closely with Berthold
  Types to insure the continued quality of the Berthold type program. He works directly
  with GGL on all his new releases. <BR> <BR>All of the contracts between H. Berthold
  AG and the designers specifically stated that when a typeface design falls into
  the public domain the obligation by Berthold to pay royalities ceases. Berthold
  Types offered to pay designers nonetheless. Notwithstanding, Hans Reichel chose
  to release a reworking of Barmeno. <BR> <BR>Interestingly, according to H. Berthold&#39;s
  royalty worksheet, Mr. Spiekermann was never paid royalties on an ongoing basis
  for Berliner Grotesk and LoType.  <BR> <BR>2. Registration of Berthold&#39;s Trademarks
  <BR>Mr. Spiekermann also implies that any company could simply register H. Berthold&#39;s
  trademarks. This is simply not true. <BR> <BR>The Type division of H. Berthold was
  a separated in October 1991 and the Type assets were &#34;leased&#34; back to H.
  Berthold by a consortium of banks. The Type division was not a part of the H. Berthold
  AG bankruptcy in 1993 and was separate from Berthold&#39;s other businesses. Berthold
  Types acquired the type assests &#40;e.g. the trademarks as well as other IP rights
  -- see the attached letter&#41; through the chain of title through these banks,
  not through bankruptcy. <BR> <BR>Accordingly, contrary to Mr. Spiekermann&#39;s
  statements, over 80 German trademark registrations, and numerous UK and US registrations,
  were assigned through the &#34;chain of title&#34; from H. Berthold AG to Berthold
  Types, including the &#34;Berthold in a red square logo&#34; and the &#34;H. Berthold&#34;
  trademarks.  <BR> <BR>3. Protection of Berthold&#39;s IP Rights <BR>Mr. Spiekermann
  states that Berthold Types has been &#34;suing dozens of people with frivolous cases
  which have cost me and other designers and foundries millions of dollars &#40;and
  I am not exaggerating&#41;.&#34; <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a myth. In fact, Berthold Types
  has filed only twelve lawsuits two of which were against FSI/FontShop &#40;both
  for trademark infringement&#41;. Mr. Spiekermann cannot provide any basis supporting
  losses of &#34;millions of dollars.&#34; Type is just not that large of a business.  <BR>
  <BR> <BR>If Mr. Spiekermann wants to debate: Stick to the facts, please. <BR> <BR>Respectfully,
  <BR> <BR>Harvey Hunt <BR>President <BR>Berthold Types Limited <BR> <BR><!--attachment:

    if I may: <BR> <BR>1&#41; You cited 5 designers with whom you have a valid business
    relationship. How many designers total are represented in your library? How would
    you describe the relationship with them? <BR> <BR>2&#41; &#34;Berthold Types has

    and other what might be informally called &#34;pre-lawsuit&#34; letters you have
    sent out? I think this is significant because -as anybody knows- a confrontational

  body: Dear Mr. Hunt, <BR> <BR>As a graphic designer, I appreciate the Berthold type
    library, particularly Akzidenz Grotesk, which may come at no surprise as I&#39;m
    sure its very popular. In fact, I&#39;d be inclined to say that if stranded on
    a desert island with one font and a newletter to publish, AG would be a top choice.
    <BR> <BR>However, when our studio is looking to purchase new fonts, I&#39;m less
    inclined to purchase from Berthold when I have heard so many rumblings of lawsuits
    and cease-and-desist letters to other, arguably smaller, type foundries over similar-sounding
    font naming taxonomies.  <BR> <BR>When I attended TypeCon last year, I was heartened
    to get my first taste of the cameraderie of the type design industry, not to mention
    observing over the last few years the friendliness of font industry designers
    and reps in their interactions here at Typophile, many of which are small business
    owners working very hard to stay afloat and perfect their craft in a tough industry.
    <BR> <BR>Many foundries and retailers were represented at TypeCon; I don&#39;t
    recall any Berthold presence, other than careful mentions in hushed conversations.
    Come to think of it, I rarely hear of anything other than legal action and scare
    tactics. Surely you must understand that while these actions intend to protect
    your assets from infringement, the perceptions of the end customer suffer. How
    would you respond to this? As one of the established names/brands in the industry,
    what is Berthold doing to preserve the craft and build the community?  <BR> <BR>Sincerely,  <BR>

  body: 'I am happy to see that the president of Berthold has posted on this forum.
    Although, I must agree with Mr. Spiekermann and the others here: posting a response
    on this forum would have been a more polite first step than having an attorney
    draft a letter and send it to him first. <BR> <BR>I think that the public exchange
    of opinion over the internet is one it&#39;s biggest perks. While it is obvious
    that Mr. Spiekermann&#39;s opinion of Berthold is not a positive one, I do not
    think that his statements were libelous or defamatory. &#40;He is certainly entitled
    to his opinion, and he is also entitled to propogate it politely&#41; Also, we
    are only looking at <i>a few short posts on an online forum.</i> I think, if someone
    with Mr. Spiekerman&#39;s gravitas in the type community wanted to go to war with
    Berthold, he easily could. And he wouldn&#39;t need do it via banter on an online
    forum. Berthold is certainly aware of this. I don&#39;t understand their ultra-protectionary,
    overtly legal-feeling reaction. <BR> <BR>B.Gibbs has an interesting point, too.
    Monotype, Linotype, FontShop, E&#43;F, and many other founderies all have presences
    at large type events and activities. Their designers all lecture, too. Is Berthold
    not doing this because it can&#39;t afford the costs? At TYPO Berlin, the Managing
    Director of Linotype, talking about piracy protection, said that the best way
    to prevent piracy is through technological and design innovation. <BR> <BR>He
    didn&#39;t say that the best method was sending out cease-and-desist letters.  <BR>
    <BR>I wonder what the impression of Berthold on this forum would be if it had
    spent the money required for its 12 lawsuits, or even the legal and translation
    fees necessary for the letter to Mr. Spiekermann, on <i>product marketing</i>
    instead?  <BR> <BR>&#40;However, Mr. Spiekermann, it is well-known that Linotype
    and many other foundries do file law suits to protect their work from piracy.
    I am assuming that FontShop does this as well. Can you tell me if cease-and-desist
    letters are common in our industry? Berthold may or may not have sent out <i>too
    many</i>, but how many are sent out by their competitors?&#41; <BR> <BR>hallo

  body: In my opinion, this issue has nothing to do with the Nazis, Jews, or the second
    World War. These are not only off topic additions/comments, they could also poison
    discussion to the extent that Berthold and/or Mr. Spiekermann would no longer
    respond to the points discussed above. <BR> <BR>I would really, really, like to
    hear from Mr. Hunt, and hear his opinion about Berthold&#39;s opinion in the design
    community. Perhaps he thinks that we are a bunch of nuts, and taht our opinions
    are not representative. Perhaps he even has sales figures to back that up! <i>I
    don&#39;t know.</i> But I would really like to know... <BR> <BR>I would also like
    to hear how many lawsuits FontShop has filed, or something similiar, to use as
    a point of comparison. If FSI has filed 24 lawsuits in the same time period that
    Berthold filed 12, that says something. If they filed 2, that says something else.
    <BR> <BR>Hrant, we all know your opinions about the US Government, and its legal
    system. In some respects, you are right, especially when it comes to Type and
    its protection. EU courts offer type designs and foundries much more protection,
    I think. <BR> <BR>However, bashing the US court system, is not so relevant to
    this topic, I think. Many of the lawsuits in discussion were filed in European
    courts, so the US and its benefits/fallacies, play little effect. <BR> <BR>Also,
    I think that &#34;Trademarking&#34; something is more of an international process
    now than a national one. <BR> <BR>Again, lets talk about Berthold. Perhaps they
    really are the demon of the type world. Perhaps we are mistaken in our opinion.
    I don&#39;t think that we will learn anything about these questions from discussing
    the ideals of democracy, or the prelude to the Holocaust. <BR> <BR>&#40;As I side

    lied, there are different interpretations on what was written, here&#39;s one.
    <BR> <BR>Spiekermann: <BR>&#62;3. Berthold Types has no contracts with any of
    the  <BR>&#62;original designers whose fonts are being sold today;  <BR>&#62;thus
    effectively stealing from designers... <BR> <BR>While Hunt says: <BR>&#62;Contrary
    to Mr. Spiekermann&#39;s statement, Berthold Types  <BR>&#62;has agreements with
    Guenter Gerhard Lange, Bernd  <BR>&#62;Moellenstaedt, Dieter Hofrichter, Orjan
    Nordling and  <BR>&#62;Prof. Werner Schneider.  <BR> <BR>Well straight away it
    should be clear that these five individuals are not those representing all the
    designs in the Berthold catalogue. <BR> <BR>Additionally it seems that Hunt is
    talking about &#34;new&#34; or reworked designs, where Spiekermann is talking
    about the &#34;original&#34; designs. <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s unlikely that
    Spiekermann is privvy to the day to day running of Berthold, so it&#39;s equally
    unlikely that he knows exactly who is doing what for them - so missing some detail
    here cannot be contsrued as lying &#40;you can only lie if you falsely state something
    that you actually know&#41;. <BR> <BR>The worst that you can say is that Spiekermann
    exaggerated - but even then he would need to know every fact, and it&#39;s not
    clear that anyone outside Bethold does, or even that Berthold itself does &#40;being
    the &#34;final&#34; recipient in a long line of bankruptcies&#41;. <BR> <BR>As
    posted by &#34;Hans Mustermann&#34; there&#39;s a great chunk of the Berthold
    library for which no designer receives a royalty.'

  body: '&#62; Perhaps that is why Erik Spiekermann will not respond in this forum.
    &#60; <BR> <BR>No, it is not. It is much simpler. but going into it may cost me
    a lot of money in lawyers&#39; fees again. The officers of FontShop International
    are restrained from discussing certain legal issues. This goes back to a certain
    foundry in Illinois selling fonts but keeping the money due to some small legal
    clause in the contract. The licensor in Berlin had to pay the original designers,
    of course, plus lots and lots of lawyers&#39; fees. This is where me mentioning
    seven digits came from. While i am not an officer of FSI. but simply a shareholder,
    that said outfit by the lake is very trigger-happy and even has a family member
    who belongs to the legal profession, making it easy to issue writs and all manner
    of legal proceedings which usually require at least a reply by another lawyer,
    in English. And that costs money, lots. Most of the suits are frivolous: there
    is a typeface called Signata. There is another face called Signa, the 2 look not
    a bit alike, but a letter was written asking to change that name as it would infringe
    upon the rights of that foundry by the lake. Which itself has another font named
    Signal which apparently cannot be confused with Signata, while Signa can. <BR>
    <BR>FSI has pursued pirates, people who simply copy FontFonts and offer them under
    a different name. If someone offered a font named Unite, i wouldn&#39;t give a
    damn, as long as it wasn&#39;t a copy of my own FF Unit. The people who couldn&#39;t
    tell one from the other would never spend money on a font anyway. <BR> <BR>And
    about the designers who now work for a certain...: <BR> <BR>They&#39;re all people
    in Munich who used to work for B and seem to have no choice in order to protect
    their investment. And some are simply blind to what&#39;s going on because they
    don&#39;t want to see 50 years of their lives going down the drain.  <BR> <BR>And
    why would a certain gentleman not appear at typo events? Because he cheated and
    still cheats designers out of their money, and they all know it and let him know
    that they know.  <BR> <BR>And i do know what goes on at B in C, as i do know what
    has been going on at B in B since the mid-60s. I designed most of their literature,
    reworked the logo and the corporate design in the 80s, made my first typefaces
    for them, wrote a book for them and was friends with their designers, managers
    and technicians here in Berlin.'

    selling my products &#40;digital typefaces&#41; with the MyFonts.com, Inc. &#40;Cambridge,
    MA, USA&#41;. In August, 2003 I received a complaint from another American company
    - Berthold Types Limited &#40;Chicago, Illinois&#41;. Ms Melissa M. Hunt alleged
    that the names of my web-site and my fonts do infringe their registered trademark
    CITY. <BR>My web-site is named &#39;fontcity.ru&#39;. My fonts are named after
    Russian cities: &#39;City of Moskva&#39; &#40;Moskva is Moscow in Russian&#41;,
    &#39;City of Khabarovsk&#39;, &#39;City of Tsaritsyn&#39;, etc. <BR>Ms Hunt alleged
    that Berthold has registered the TM &#34;CITY&#34; and that my fonts names are
    a &#39;colorable imitation&#39; of this TM. <BR> <BR>I strongly oppose this position:
    <BR>- I suppose the word &#34;city&#34; is a generic term and is not a particularly
    strong TM. Moreover, I am a national of Russia and Berthold has no registered
    TM in Russia. <BR>- My fonts are performed in an original graphical manner and
    the whole line of typefaces has its own unique style. There cannot be any confusion
    between my fonts and the ones of Berthold company. <BR>- Moreover, I use the word
    &#34;city&#34; in its original lexical meaning, in an illustrative and descriptive
    way only. This word is a part of a single whole concept I create to present my
    products. I have created my own unique style including typefaces &#40;the character
    shapes&#41;, their names, description texts, music, animation, pictures, color
    palette and so on. I invented the new word &#39;FONTCITY&#39; for naming my web-site.
    <BR>- I understand, that the names &#39;Moskva&#39;, &#39;Khabarovsk&#39;, &#39;Tsaritsyn&#39;
    and so on mean nothing to the most of people, not only Americans, but Russians
    too. I can&#39;t delete or substitute the word &#34;city&#34; without distortion
    of the names&#39; sense. <BR>- I can&#39;t name my fonts in Russian because there
    are certain rules requiring to use the numbers and English letters only for this
    purpose. <BR> <BR>As I know, many companies and persons were urged to change the
    names of their fonts by Berthold. All of them do not accept the accusations but
    to avoid possible costs of litigation had to follow instructions from Berthold.

    - internet-law.ru&#39;s forum <BR> <BR>Recently my American partner, the MyFonts.com,
    Inc. decided to suspend selling my fonts. <BR>I believe Berthold&#39;s actions
    constitute unfair competition and abuse of intellectual property rights. They
    are filing lawsuits against small-sized companies and independent font developers
    worldwide. <BR> <BR>I have no money and possibility to file a lawsuit against
    Berthold. However I am firmly convinced that Berthold isn&#39;t right. Your organization
    is well-known for protecting legitimate rights of consumers and businesses alike
    in the digital age. <BR>I would appreciate any kind of assistance or guidelines
    concerning the matter in question. <BR> <BR>You can find more information on my

    I don&#39;t blame him for that and I appreciate truth coming from anyone and everyone
    since I have no way of knowing who the honest ones are.  I don&#39;t know about
    the Adobe &#34;compatability lists&#34; and have never heard of them prior to
    today.   <BR>There does seem to be a great deal of at least sentiment, if not
    evidence, that the once proud name of Berthold has now fallen to the level of
    vicious predator.  It would seem that Berthold should be forthcoming and lay ALL
    of the truth on the table very soon if it wants to have any chance to redeem itself
    in the eyes of the community which not only buys but specs and recomends type
    faces to the world. Typographers, type designers, art directors, graphic designers,
    and publishers are the gatekeepers of type purchase.  If many of them boycott
    any single foundry, it can have a large impact on their profits.  We have many
    alternative suppliers to choose from and are within our rights for any reason
    to use and recomend &#40;or not recomend&#41; any typeface or vendor.  Berthold
    may have legal means of preventing others from naming fonts to their liking and
    not paying designers for their work but there is no law that says we MUST use
    their products if we choose not to.  No company can survive abusing their own
    clients.  <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    <BR>That&#39;s seems true Dan. The average computer user only uses the fonts that
    come bundled free with other software or operating system.  The concept of buying
    type is pretty much tied to the design and publishing industry.  Corporations
    use what their design/branding consultants recomend. If you look at advertising
    by type houses, you can see it is tailored to the same crowd.  Ads are placed
    in the design trade mags with lots of sponsorship of organization events like
    AIGA or TDC.  You don&#39;t see type ads placed with broad market strategies in
    Newsweek or Fortune.  Adobe most likely places ads for their products with broader
    market appeal, like Acrobat, in many more venues than its type collection.  Type
    houses are smart buniness men/women for the most part.  They know who the gatekeepers
    are and would not waste money placing ads in unproductive markets.'

  body: Chris, this is exactly my point. I don&#39;t think that Berthold actually
    does advertise. And &#40;Thomas/Simon?&#41; I don&#39;t think that they license
    their fonts for font bundling anymore, either. <BR> <BR>To me, this seems like
    two unwise business decisions. <BR> <BR>I think that Berthold&#39;s sales probably
    come through AG, and <b>its</b> fame and reputation. All of the trouble recently
    on Typophile came about because some posters recommended not buying AG from <b>Berthold</b>.
    This must have been seen as threat enough by Mr. Hunt; in any event it seemed
    to have ruffled his feathers enough to pay his lawyer and translator to write
    a stupid letter to Erik Spiekermann. We all know how much lawywers charge by the
    hour. <BR> <BR>Well, what if we just <b>didn&#39;t</b> buy AG from Berthold anymore.
    It isn&#39;t like the world isn&#39;t full enough with similar and/or better typefaces
    anyway... we could just recommend to all of our clients that they should use &#40;insert
    your favorite Helvetica/Grotesk style here&#41; instead, because, quite frankly,
    they should not give their money to a man like Mr. Hunt. <BR> <BR>Most media buyers/clients
    won&#39;t care one way or another, I suspect. But designers can make a &#40;small&#41;
    difference. This would, in the grand scheme of things, be a small difference,
    but it would improve our little sector of the market.

  body: Bitstreams clones are not illegal! In the 1980s, Bitstream licensed the entire
    Linotype library for sale. However, their agreement with Linotype only allowed
    them to sell the designs, not the names themselves. So, Bitstream had to come
    up with its own naming system. Swiss and Helvetica were therefore the same design,
    just with different names. This was not illegal or immoral at all. Linotype, and
    its designers, got paid. Since then, Bitstream has gotten a different license,
    which also allows them to name the Linotype fonts correctly. &#40;I think that
    this is all true&#41; <BR> <BR>Hrant could perhaps make legal Poppl revivals.
    As most of us know, only Typeface names &#40;and their digital outlines&#41; are
    trademarkable, except in Germany. In Germany, the DESIGN of a font is also protected
    by a patent, as long as that patent has been officially registered in Germany.
    These design patents expire after 25 year, and can never be renewed. The names
    and the outlines can be renewed, though. <BR> <BR>So, if Hrant makes new drawings
    based off of a Poppl design that is over 25 years old, doesn&#39;t reference Berthold&#39;s
    actual files, and names it something totally different, he could legally sell
    that font as a revival. He could also patent the font and its design in Germany,
    and have the legal protection of thh German courts behind him when Berthold eventually
    would sue. <BR> <BR>But that would be a suit that Berthold would lose, in any
    court, anywhere. That would be a fun day.

    library, he replied &#34;in the usual manner&#34;&#42;&#42;, which basically meant
    swiping - but the point is that so many companies did that &#40;including ATF,
    <i>Enschede</i>, and so many more&#41;, people -unfortunately- mind it less. What
    people are complaining about in this thread is <i>bullying</i>, and to many of
    us that&#39;s a greater violation of the social fabric. Focus, please. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    And/or maybe vent &#40;see below&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; See the Romano article

    anyone claim they broke any laws. <BR> <BR>What you have to get is that this is
    not about legality, but ethics. Sometimes you seem to get that important distinction,
    but when it&#39;s convenient you squirm around it. Which of course is typical
    of anonymous participants, since they have nothing to loose. On the other hand,
    as long as somebody like me is around, they still won&#39;t get away with the
    spin, so the best way to describe your participation here is &#34;venting&#34;.

    I guess the point could be different for each of us. But to me -and I think to
    many others- the main point here isn&#39;t about stealing, it is about bullying.
    Most of the complaints above have nothing to do with stealing anything, except
    of course if you count human dignity. <BR> <BR>That said, in fact I do make a
    huge distinction between stealing from individuals versus companies. One of the
    worst things about capitalism is that it treats companies as entities deserving
    more respect than individuals. <BR> <BR>&#62; they are all going to do their best
    to protect their work from others <BR> <BR>Bull. Decent people draw the line this
    side of decency, the rest don&#39;t. Which isn&#39;t to say that line is set in
    stone, not at all. But some cases most everybody can agree on, and it is those
    that need to be addressed first, obviously. You&#39;re simply clouding the issue.
    And since we don&#39;t know who you are, we have every reason to believe you&#39;re
    just a spin doctor. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62; Exactly my point with Bitstream.
    <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t distract with more Bitstream stories. What they did was a &#40;sad&#41;
    norm of sorts. This is not. Furthermore, in the past few years Bitstream has done
    more good things &#40;like recanting on their disregard of embedding permissions&#41;
    than most anybody else. While this is an <i>ongoing</i> issue, not a historical
    one. <BR> <BR>It seems you have a pet vendetta against Bitstream &#40;which makes
    you smell just like another chronic anonyrat Typophile experiences now and again&#41;,
    in which case I&#39;d suggest using a separate thread for venting. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: From a practical perspective, it makes sense for the small business to avoid
    litigation. <BR> <BR>So the best strategy for a foundry is to give its fonts made-up
    names, or really obscure names &#40;eg Mrs Eaves -- although that is kinda like
    Mr Stinky&#41;. I&#39;m surprised we don&#39;t see more typefaces with Autechre/AphexTwin
    music-title kind of names. <BR> <BR>One doesn&#39;t have to be bullied to be intimidated.
    To my mind, Apple and Adobe&#39;s font bundling practice is no different than
    what the EU recently fined Microsoft for, and an absolutely massive suppression
    of the market for fonts, both prosumer and professional. But it&#39;s unlikely
    that any government is going to go after a company for dumping fonts. I mean,
    it&#39;s only fonts, duh. And I&#39;m certainly not going to sue them!  <BR> <BR>As
    for Bitstream&#39;s marketing clout, if you can&#39;t beat &#39;em, join &#39;em.  <BR>I
    know from personal experience that big CD collections of legacy and back catalogue
    fonts reduce the need for companies to buy fresh fonts. Many times I&#39;ve had
    art directors say &#34;Sorry Nick, I recommended your typeface, used it in a comp,
    even, but they have the Adobe/Bitstream collection, and want to use something
    similar from that&#34;. <BR> <BR>So I&#39;m 100% behind Bitstream&#39;s initiative
    of including a &#34;sampler&#34; of fonts from a variety of independent foundries,
    as part of the Type Odyssey CD, and glad to be represented.

    own. This thread is generally about Berthold Types tactics that some have serious
    issues with. If it&#39;s kept on task and civil, then we can reasonably continue
    to expect input from all sides from the Hunt&#39;s to the Boton&#39;s and the

    - including Nero. <BR> <BR>As another example, I would like to know why the Hunt&#39;s

    you will demonize Bitsttream at the same time. Bitstream, and its licensing stories
    have been discussed many times on this forum. Even if they are guilty of piracy
    in the past, which I don&#39;t believe, they are certainly clean now. <BR> <BR>Berthold,
    which was once very clean, is now very dirty, as exemplified by the first thread
    in this discussion. <BR> <BR>At least I have the decency to post under my real

    I would like to know the answers to your two questions, too. However, you know
    that Mr. Hunt won&#39;t answer them. Especially question number two... no foundry
    is going to tell you the exact number of cease and desist letters taht they have
    sent out. <BR> <BR>And Bouncer, this doesn&#39;t justify Berthold&#39;s actions
    one bit. If FSI, Linotype, Bitsream, et al. sent out as many questionable letters
    as Berthold had, we&#39;d all know about it. Those storeis would show up here,
    too, and they haven&#39;t. <BR> <BR>Lastly, Hrant, I know that you are afraid
    of American lawyers, but they aren&#39;t all bad. In the example I used before,
    about legit revivals, the ficticious designer in question would have nothing to
    fear. Some lawyers do go over the top in litigation, but sometimes the law is
    chrystal clear. In the case of type, there are so few laws that it would be asy
    to rest assured knowing that a certain party would be right in a certain case.

    - these are people who are engaged in revivals of their own work or extensions
    of the same. Berthold has no choice but to pay them because they wouldn&#39;t
    do the &#34;new&#34; work otherwise. <BR> <BR>Therefore it is obvious that those
    that are not named are not getting paid - because the &#34;spin control&#34; would

    will demonize Bitsttream <BR> <BR>I never forgave Berthold, nowhere in this thread.
    And what Bitstream did in terms of design theft was much worse than Berthold.
    It&#39;s easy. <BR> <BR>&#62;Even if they are guilty of piracy in the past, which  <BR>&#62;I
    don&#39;t believe, they are certainly clean now. <BR> <BR>What do you mean you
    don&#39;t believe!? Bitstream stole all of Linotype&#39;s designs, renamed them
    and sold them for years and years - there was no deal with Linotype that allowed
    them to do this. <BR> <BR>Please, show us some evidence to back up your claim?
    <BR> <BR>The reason all the names were changed was because otherwise it would
    infringe the trademark, the only protection available to Linotype in the USA.
    IE Bitstream relied on the law rather than ethics. <BR> <BR>I believe you are

  body: 'Back to the intital issue &#40;i only read these posting once a week&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>1. The case between FSI and HH ended in a compromise after so much money
    was spent that FSI couldn&#39;t go on. Which is the purpose of starting all these
    suits in Illinois. And Mrs H being a lawyer sure helps keep the expenses down
    for them. Mr H says that designers were paid as the result of the compromise.
    They were, but only by FSI. H kept all the money he had taken for the sales of
    FontFonts when the franchise agreement was terminated because of some technical
    clause particular to Illinois law. I never understood how a court could make a
    contract void but let  one of the 2 parties keep the proceeds from a void deal.
    But then i am not a lawyer and operate under the simple premise that designers
    should get paid by whoever gets proceeds from selling their fonts. I am expecting
    another letter from Chicago because i wasn&#39;t supposed to discuss this in public,
    ever. But i can let H know already that i&#39;ll ignore whatever comes from him.
    He&#39;ll have to send the sheriffs over to get anything out of me. Or the Marine
    Corps. <BR> <BR>2. If Getraude Popple &#40;Friedrich Poppl&#39;s widow&#41; spoke
    english, i&#39;d get her to write her version of the dealings with H. She never
    signed a contract because she couldn&#39;t agree with the conditions. So Poppl&#39;s
    fonts are sold without a contract, illegally. She hasn&#39;t got the means to
    pursue the matter, and H knows this. <BR> <BR>There are lots of other stories
    to be told about H&#39;s behaviour and attitude towards our business. The one
    thing i can mention is the news that got all this started: if someone tries to
    prevent another foundry from using the word &#34;Grotesk&#34; or &#34;Grotesque&#34;
    in a typeface name, that person is not out to protect a tradename, but to harrass
    the competition. If he hadn&#39;t lost that one, the next step could have been
    sueing anybody who used Sans or Serif or Antiqua, as all these are part of some
    Berthold trademark or other. <BR> <BR>3. Just the fact that no typedesigner outside
    a small bunch of people who used to work for Berthold will work for them should
    be enough to tell the rest of the community &#40;or call it business&#41; what
    their practices are. They all know more than can be told here. <BR> <BR>4. A lof
    of people think that B in Chicago is not a legal successor. H writes: <BR> <BR>&#62;The
    acquisition of the designs and trademarks was recognized by the German Patent
    and Trademark Office as well as by WIPO, which authorities recorded the assignments.
    In that regard, Berthold Types Limited acquired the Type Assets and thereby is
    also the legal successor to H. Berthold AG. &#60; <BR> <BR>This is a very clever
    way of making something sound logical and obvious, but it isn&#39;t. A new company
    having acquired the assets of an old company doesn&#39;t make the new company
    the legal successor, it just makes it the owner of the assets. If they honoured
    the old contracts, one might be more inclined to believe that argument. But when
    it comes to paying old dues and debts, the new company conveniently seems to have
    no connections with its predecessor. <BR> <BR>Intimidation and bullying is their
    game, as simple as that. <BR>'

    my response in the same forum.  <BR> <BR>FONTSHOP USA <BR>As you recall there
    was a business dispute between FontShop USA &#40;a Fontshop distribution company
    owned by me&#41; and FSI Fonts und Software GmbH. This dispute was resolved in
    the form of a Settlement Agreement that FSI insisted be confidential. <BR> <BR>It
    appears that FSI&#39;s intention was to keep the truth confidential while FSI
    embarked on a crusade claiming that I cheated designers out of their money. Nothing
    could be farther from the truth. <BR> <BR>Here are the facts: <BR> <BR>1. FontShop
    USA agreed to pay &#40;and PAID&#41; the designers&#39; portion of the sales of
    FontFonts. The dispute was with FSI and never the FontFont designers.  <BR> <BR>2.
    FSI audited and declared valid every single sale of a FontFont typeface &#40;Petra
    Weitz coordinated this&#41;. <BR> <BR>3. FontShop USA paid FSI close to six figures
    &#40;US$&#41; representing the designers&#39; portion of the sales of FontFonts.
    The dispute did not involve millions of dollars and FSI certainly did not pay
    the FontFont designers out of its own pocket as claimed by Erik. <BR> <BR>4. FSI
    also got the &#34;fontshop.com&#34; domain and Joan got to open her own FontShop

    has every right to choose who he likes and dislikes. But he does not have a right
    to lie in an effort to disparage my reputation and that of my companies. <BR>

    the &#42;real&#42; topic&#41;: <BR> <BR>There are obviously different ways of
    presenting the truth. While i know that there is more to this than Mr Hunt states,
    i cannot present any real figures and facts without entering a very libelous area.
    Suffice to say that dealing with someone who sees people in this business not
    as partners but as potential enemies has cost other parties dearly, mainly in
    lawyers&#39; fees &#40;BTW: his wife, Melissa, is a lawyer&#41;. Thus, with Mr
    Hunt&#39;s history of sueing everybody who has an opinion in the typographic world,
    i would be a fool to carry on. By now, everybody on this forum will have formed
    their own opinion.  <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s go back to where this thread started: <BR>We
    all agree that tradenames need protection against rip-off artists, and  that our
    libraries need to be protected against pirates. We also seem to agree that it
    is at least frivolous if not downright petty and vindictive when foundries get
    pursued for using generic terms like &#34;Grotesk&#34; in naming their fonts.
    We probably also agree that the type-buying public can differentiate between a
    name like Signa and one like Signata, especially if the typefaces involved look
    totally different from each other. And finally we agree that designers should
    be paid properly for their work through contracts that are fair and easy to understand.
    The fact that numerous well-known designers have chosen not to enter into contractual
    agreements with the self-declared Berthold successor in Chicago speaks for itself.
    <BR> <BR>Private business has nothing to do with this issue. There are many designers
    out there who know what i am not allowed to talk about as they have been party
    to the history of this conflict. They know my reputation and they know what the

  body: 'Erik, you clearly have no clue about trademarks and the value it would bring
    the type industry if only members of the type industry bothered to educate themselves.
    Although there are more and more type designers who read Typophile that are registering
    their trademarks, I am always amazed at how often Typophile posts include incorrect
    or inaccurate information regarding trademarks.  <BR> <BR>For example, you say
    that you have no problem with FF UNITE so long as the design is not the same as
    FF UNIT. You are doing yourself, your business and the type industry a serious
    disservice with this position.  <BR> <BR>If a designer created a typeface called
    HELVETICAR or HELVETICAL, Linotype certainly would have a serious problem with
    that designer regardless of whether the design looked like HELVETICA. <BR> <BR>Trademark
    law is intended to give a exclusivity to the first company/person who registers
    &#40;or in the U.S. first peron who uses&#41; a particular trademark in connection
    with PARTICULAR GOODS. The goods in our industry are FONTS; for purposes of trademark
    law, there is no distinction between the design of one font versus the design
    of another font: the registered trademark applies to all fonts &#40;not a particular
    font design&#41;. <BR> <BR>For this reason, the US trademark office refused FSI&#39;s
    application for SIGNA citing Berthold&#39;s SIGNATA as a barrier. <BR> <BR>After
    the Barmeno/FF New Barmen fiasco which you started, FSI is now held to a higher
    standard not to come anywhere close to the Berthold trademarks. <BR> <BR>If, at
    the time, Berthold was not trying to cause FSI &amp; its FontShop Network to stop
    selling counterfeit Berthold fonts offered by BSK/Babylon Schrift Kontor, there
    is no way we would have ever allowed FSI to continue using the name FF SIGNA.
    Business disputes require compromise so we compromised.  <BR> <BR>Trademark law
    also does not require that the infringer use the EXACT trademark. The US requires
    only that the mark be &#34;confusingly similar&#34; and looks at the facts and
    circumstances of the situation. Other jurisdictions &#40;e.g. England&#41; also
    do not require use of the EXACT trademark to find infringement.  <BR> <BR>Contrary
    to your apparent assumptions, the type buying public is a much broader group than
    type and graphic designers. Therefore the type buying public would likely have
    difficulty distinguishing between trademarked type names with slight differences.
    Also because the type buying public relies more and more on purchasing over the
    web without assistance from people knowledgeable about type, and because they
    rely on search engines &#40;dedicated to type like MyFonts or otherwise like Google&#41;,
    using similar typeface names could cause confusion to buyers. <BR> <BR> <BR>FONTSHOP,
    THE SPIEKERMANNS AND THE DOUBLE STANDARD <BR>Both Gustav Jaeger and Mrs. Poppl
    have not signed agreements with any Berthold successor after H. Berthold AG declared
    bankruptcy in 1993. <BR> <BR>Notwithstanding, in 1994 when Joan and Erik Spiekermann&#39;s
    FontShop were distributing the Berthold typefaces &#40;via an agreement with Berthold
    Systeme&#41;, Erik produced FontBook update 2, the introduction stated <BR> <BR>&#34;This
    shows the 1400 typefaces in the Berthold Type Library released by Berthold in
    Berlin, Germany. Many of these fonts are available from other type sources, but
    the Berthold versions are renowned for their sensitive interpretation.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>Was Erik talking about cheating designers like Jaeger or Poppl then? Of course
    not. FontShop &#40;and Erik&#41; were making money from the Berthold typefaces.
    <BR> <BR>AND, more recently the FontShops were &#40;and some still are&#41; making
    money selling counterfeit Berthold fonts offered by BSK/Babylon Schrift Kontor
    denying Lange &#40;Erik&#39;s close friend of many years&#41; and Moellenstaedt
    &#40;a past ATypI board member who he has known for decades&#41; money for sales
    of their typefaces. <BR> <BR>Did Erik Spiekermann complain about cheating Berthold
    type designers? No. <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m curious. Is this because those who wrote the law and &#34;lawyers&#34;
    in general don&#39;t see and haven&#39;t been educated to the differences? It
    assumes a lot to say that &#34;typophiles&#34; are probably alone in seeing the
    minute differences. Granted it also assumes a lot that they aren&#39;t alone.
    But isn&#39;t that where the law falls apart and fails us? They write a law but
    don&#39;t bother to see the possible differences? &#34;What ARE typefaces ...
    who cares ... it is all Times, Arial and Verdana.&#34; It seems to me that this
    law needs some brushing off and cleaning up if something as simple as a few letters
    or a vague descriptor is giving people the right to go to court. What a waste
    of energy. I suppose I do understand wanting to protect what you worked to create.
    But with something like type ... word gets around ... most anyone who is going
    to license type and understands the investment they are making will shop around
    and ask around ... typophile is proof of that, we get questions all the time.
    Why would we suggest Signata if what they really want is Signa? The name, at the
    end of the day, is irrelevant to the person who will license the type. It is actually
    the design that counts the most. I have had clients ask me the difference between
    Times Roman and Times New Roman, I know that it is only typophiles that are interested.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>--------------- <BR> <BR>On another similar note. I&#39;m curious
    about contracts for use of their designs. In the world of design, and as I understand
    it, once a contract expires or if no contract is signed, the ownership of the
    artwork reverts &#40;or is always&#41; with the designer. Isn&#39;t this the same
    with typeface design? I&#39;m referring to the GAG Handbook of Pricing and Ethical
    Guidlines ... According to the Fair Practices Act sections 359.350 &#40;Definitions
    for ORS 359.350 to 359.365&#41;, 359.355 &#40;Art work reproduction rights retained
    by artist unless expressly transferred; effect of federal copyright laws&#41;,
    359.360 &#40;Ownership of physical work of art remains with artist unless expressly
    transferred&#41;, 359.365 &#40;Ambiguity in agreement transferring right to reproduce
    art work resolved in favor of artist&#41;  <BR> <BR>What I&#39;m driving at, in
    my own inarticulate manner, is while a typeface name and design may be trademarked
    ... or is the design only copyrighted ... by a given foundry, shouldn&#39;t the
    design itself revert back to the originator of the design? <BR> <BR>---------------
    <BR> <BR>If you can trademark a word, but names are too ambiguous you must add
    a word that somehow makes it unequivocal, what is the difference from this to
    just adding a few letters? <BR> <BR>If we look at the following examples, and
    I&#39;ve stuck to the two foundries which have been discussed, maybe someone can
    explain these to me. <BR> <BR>ITC Esprit, 1985 &#40;which FontShop carries&#41;
    <BR>Sayer Esprit, ? <BR> <BR>Signata, 1994 <BR>Signal <BR>FF Signa <BR> <BR>All
    different. Is it okay then for a foundry to work against itself? I&#39;m sincere
    in my questions, for once I&#39;m not trying to be cheeky. <BR>

    to the fact that the USPTO is overworked, understaffed, and Patent and TM laws

    <BR>From their &#34;About FSI&#34; page: <BR> <BR>FSI &#40;FontShop International&#41;,
    founded in 1990, is a renowned type foundry based in Berlin, Germany, with an

    word &#34;city&#34; in the name of a typeface is going to lead to consumer confusion.  That&#39;s
    almost akin to trying to trademark &#34;Greek&#34; or &#34;Type&#34; or &#34;Hand&#34;!
    Perhaps you should simply make a crappy typeface &#40;not that the original Berthold
    typefaces are crappy&#41; for every potential generic font name soon-to-be in
    existence and put all future competitors out of business! <BR> <BR>Or perhaps
    someone in the Typophile community should register the name &#34;Berthold&#34;
    for numerous types of products beyond the reach of your current trademarks, if

    We&#39;re not talking  <BR>about knock-off Kate Spade handbags or fake Swiss Army  <BR>watches.
    <BR> <BR>Mr. Hunt, with all due respect, and with the humor aside. I hope  <BR>you&#39;ll

    <BR>Regardless of the technicalities of the law, regardless of your  <BR>ability

    a collection of  <BR>perceptions in your customers&#39; minds... And obviously
    you value  <BR>the Berthold name or you wouldn&#39;t desire to protect it by setting  <BR>some

    to the topic. Designers shouldn&#39;t be put off trying to register their type
    names to offer some kind of protection from the law. The more pertinent problem
    is that very few people in our industry can afford to defend themselves in the
    sort of cases brought against them, many are outrageous, but to defend the accusations:
    reckon with 6 figure sums and twice or three times that to take it to court. <BR>

    In this respect, bullying tactics is an apt description and seems to be a pattern.
    We have always had to agree to settlements in the end, no matter how long we tried
    to hold out. Financials aside, humans eventually run out of steam too and are
    beaten down. But a legal Agreement doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that parties are
    in agreement - it&#39;s always a pragmatic matter of &#34;do we go bankrupt defending

    office refused FSI&#39;s application for SIGNA citing Berthold&#39;s SIGNATA as
    a barrier.&#34;  <BR> <BR>When FSI applied to register FF Signa, the US trademark
    office initially turned it down on the grounds that it was similar to &#34;Signata
    and FF Signa&#34; &#40;really, the name of our own font was cited against us as
    being similar, we have the letter!&#41; It is very common, and has happened to
    FSI many times, that the initial application is turned down, especially if someone
    objects to its registration. You then show reasons why the name and font is different
    and it is then often accepted. In this case it was Berthold Types who objected
    and it was abandoned by FSI because Berthold Types began a long, exhausting and
    complicated case against FSI and FontShop Germany tying in this registration with
    other FontShops&#39; selling &#40;legal&#41; BSK fonts along with FF CityStreetType,
    FF Avance and other issues.  <BR>We are still convinced that we would have succeeded
    in registering FF Signa and others had it not been for yet another case which
    cost all of FSI&#39;s financial and emotional resources.  <BR>Some &#34;confusing&#34;
    font names could spark a whole new thread, see already, and we list a few below
    for interest. There are hundreds more similar names, so FSI may be forgiven for
    the suspicion that a certain amount of harassment is involved in their case. We
    feel angry and sorry for the people who have been forced to remove &#34;City&#34;
    from their font names. FSI were &#34;allowed&#34; in their agreement to continue

    advice to those people who are afraid the attacks from Berthold. The majority
    of my friends and attorney worldwide came to similar opinion: <BR> <BR>- &#34;Issuing
    a lawsuit, in the US, is an everyday practice, even for reasons which, in other
    nations, would not justify a legal action. The Berthold case is a good example
    of this kind of approach: the company issues a lawsuit to scare a potential competitor.
    Anyway, on a factual level, we have to consider this: laws are not the same in
    any single part of the world and it&#39;s very likely there&#39;s no way to make
    a US Tribunal judgement effective in Russia as well. It may even be that on a

    if the contract is ended by either party, and the type designer subsequently decides
    to market either the font software or the trade name, then the original publisher
    is entitled to a cut of the revenue, based on its contribution to the font software
    or brand equity built up in the trade name by its marketing. The percentage to
    be negotiated.  <BR> <BR>In a situation where the publisher holds the copyright
    to the font software, but not the trademark, then if the designer wants out, and

    least the case with Arcana. Although we will provide Gabriel the version that
    we have done our work on, he cannot take that version and license or sell it to

  body: 'Oh, a plague on North American PC, which will get you censored for _not_
    using a four-letter word! &#40;and regarding which, see Nikki Finke&#39;s latest
    column in LA Weekly, which you can get off the Drudge Report&#41; ... but I ought
    to apologize for witlessness, because if I had my wits about me, I would have
    brought up my one experience with trademark infringement, i.e., when Adobe sent
    me a slew of threat letters warning me against using &#39;their trademark&#39;
    and &#39;their typeface data&#39; in any product of my own. Needless to say, the
    trademark and data they referred to were mine. I told Adobe I was using the data
    regardless, and if they didn&#39;t like it they could sue me. As that was some
    years ago and I haven&#39;t heard a word from them since, it seems clear that
    their threat was empty, designed merely to scare a designer whom they had treated
    badly. One thing I have observed: when an industry is growing, there is no litigation;
    when an industry is dying, there is nothing but litigation.  <BR> <BR>What effect
    did it have on me? I went from working on type for at least 60 hours a week, to
    working on type for about 60 hours a year. The advantage is that I started doing
    some other interesting things that were important to me; the disadvantage is that
    I would have preferred to work on type, but who could deal with such a poisonous
    environment? I didn&#39;t go into type to be reviled and sued by unspeakable persons
    like Adobe&#39;s Donna Kolness. I went into type to create beautiful text.  <BR>
    <BR>That said, I am looking at a contract from a perfectly nice foundry, but I
    can&#39;t yet bring myself to sign it. I fear what may follow. However, this time
    around, if it actually happens, I ought to have enough experience to sign a better
    contract. I never looked at Adobe&#39;s contract - I was too happy to have it.
    I trusted them implicitly, believed in their fundamental goodness.'

  body: 'In addition to my previous posts, following are additional points: <BR> <BR>The
    Berthold Exklusiv Collection was conceived by GGL about 50 years ago and completed
    by the time he left H. Berthold AG in 1990. <BR> <BR>The type business was very
    different back then as the Berthold typefaces were specific to Berthold equipment,
    as was the case with Linotype and Monotype. When a designer had one of their typeface
    designs published by Berthold, the agreement provided that Berthold was the owner
    of the intellectual property rights because of the high costs of bringing a Berthold
    typeface to market.  <BR> <BR>The creative process of digitizing and creating
    the full character sets were done under GGL&#39;s supervision at the Berthold
    Type Atelier in Munich. In most cases only the essential characters were digitized
    and then the remaining characters were then created by Berthold. H. Berthold AG
    was always listed as co-author of the typeface designs. <BR> <BR>The font software
    for the Berthold Exklusiv Collection was developed by Berthold. When Berthold
    Types took over the library, Poppl and Jaeger insisted on renegotiating their
    original contracts and wanted ownership of the Berthold copyrighted font software.
    <BR> <BR>Albert Boton had already made a deal with another foundry &#40;using
    Berthold&#39;s copyrighted data&#41; for the other typeface in the Berthold library
    and only wanted to sign an agreement with the typeface Boton and have Berthold
    withdraw Agora. <BR> <BR>Berthold typeface designs can be found in the libraries
    of Bitstream, E&#43;F, Linotype, Paratype, Scangraphic and URW all used without
    permission with no money going to Lange, other Berthold designers, or to Berthold
    for that matter. <BR> <BR>FF Blur is Lange&#39;s AG Old Face processed through
    Photoshop with the &#34;blur&#34; filter. FSI does not pay Lange royalties or
    Berthold for use of the data to create a derivative. <BR> <BR>Problems with typeface
    names were virtually non-existant &#40;by today&#39;s standards&#41; until the
    advent of PostScript and programs like Fontographer that enabled hundreds of people
    to produce fonts. Berthold&#39;s trademarks have been around for decades. <BR>
    <BR>With all due respect to Mr. Shipovsky &#40;FontCity&#41; but his Russian attorney&#39;s
    &#34;opinion&#34; is worthless in regard to U.S. and EU law. <BR> <BR>Finally,
    there is a co-existence agreement between Linotype and Monotype for the &#34;Times&#34;
    trademark and Adobe pays royalties to both companies for use of it. <BR> <BR>The
    fact that both companies use the &#34;Times&#34; trademark, therefore, should
    not be seen as the right to use other people&#39;s trademarks for new typeface
    names &#40;e.g. Boogaloo Boulevard, Omicron Delta, City of --- &#41;. Boulevard
    and Delta have been trademarks owned by the Berthold foundry for decades.'

  body: 'Just to take a little point here, I suspect the &#39;Times&#39; trademark
    is not capable of being defended because of its decades-prior use by ATF, for
    example, as in Times Gothic, a typeface shown &#40;but not identified&#41; by
    Tracy as an example of Will Ransom&#39;s design. &#39;Times Roman&#39; perhaps,
    but not &#39;Times&#39; per se in a typeface. In fact, if anything, Mono and Lino
    are in violation of ATF&#39;s rights for attempting to assert trademark ownership
    in any typeface containing the word &#39;Times&#39;. One has got oneself into
    a very absurd position when one is reduced to discussing what rights Lino and
    Mono might have in Times and whether Adobe should be paying for those rights or
    not.  <BR> <BR>One wonders if there has been any friction between Agfa and Berthold
    over the use of tradenames such as Bembo? For example, Mono made it impossible
    for Scangraphic to sell its versions of faces such as Bembo, Perpetua, Centaur
    &amp; Poliphilus on the grounds that the license was for Scangraphic&#39;s proprietary
    format and could not be applied to the Postscript conversions.  <BR> <BR>With
    all this dreadful litigation going on, we still don&#39;t have a usable digital
    version of Bembo. The Mono version is incorrectly designed. The Berthold version
    is correctly designed but only has two f-ligs, and those incorrectly designed.
    The illegal Scangraphic design is also correctly designed but the five f-ligs
    are merely generic, much like Adobe&#39;s ahistorical f-ligs for the &#39;expert&#39;
    versions of the Berthold faces they used to license. The last thing they were
    was expert. I wonder what drudge designed them? <BR> <BR>License, license, and
    litigation, yak-yak, and yet nobody ever solves the problems in the fonts. As
    the redoubtable Ed Mendelsohn said years ago, &#39;I would pay good money for
    a usable version of Bembo, and this despite the fact that I have two children
    to educate.&#39; <BR> <BR>Harvey, the last time I saw you your jaw had fallen
    and you couldn&#39;t get it up. Is it now in working order? '

    but I&#39;ll require proof. That takes care of the first issue: did he do it?
    The second issue is, what does it matter? &#40;In this particular case, that is,
    for a dozen obvious reasons.&#41; <BR> <BR>And by the way, if you were going to
    use the PS Blur filter, why on earth would you bother to use a vector font as
    your input? You could use a scan of anything - that would be the obvious thing
    to do. For the moment you&#39;ll have to count me amongst the rude unpersuaded.
    <BR> <BR>And by the way, suppose Brody didn&#39;t use vector data, but used a
    scan from some old specimen book. Would you still have an issue with that?  <BR>
    <BR>Here&#39;s another question: to what extent is Concorde a Times clone? As
    I understand the story, it was intended as a Times clone, even though it doesn&#39;t
    really look like one. But in intent, it is, to a certain extent, a Times clone.
    Does anyone have an issue with that?  <BR> <BR>And what about that version of
    AG that actually is a Helvetica clone? Is Berthold expected to pay Lino, or the
    estate of Max Miedinger, royalties on that? '
