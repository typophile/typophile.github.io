    It's possible that Rudolf Koch had done something too.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "When talking about \u2018Fraktur\u2019 one has to distinguish between Textura,
    which has an interrupted construction and Fraktur, which has a running construction.
    D\xFCrers geometrical constructions rather refer to the Textura than to the Fraktur.
    I do not know what is written on this spanish website here, but the first illustration
    shows Neud\xF6rffers Fraktur and the second and the third show D\xFCrers Textura.
    \r\n\r\nD\xFCrer worked with Neud\xF6rffer on this remarkable piece of work here.

    a couloured image which also gives an impression of the real size, check this

    on the image next to \u2018Ein comic f\xFCr den Kaiser\u2019\r\nIt is one of the
    largest objects that has been assembled from wood prints. The Fraktur on the lowest
    row of 5 panels has been written by Neud\xF6rffer on the wood blocks before it
    was cut. At least this is what thorough research by Werner Doede (20th century)
    and Oliver Linke (21st century) has proven. The meaning of Neud\xF6rffer for the
    development of the Fraktur as a writing style (Neud\xF6rffer published several
    writing manuals) and printing type (The typeface by Hyeronimus Andre\xE4 is based
    on Neud\xF6rffers handwriting) is both discussed in the literature by Oliver Linke
    and Gerrit Noordzij. Schematically speaking, the difference between Textura and
    Fraktur can be illustrated like this:\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/albert-jan_pool/11468753126/in/set-72157629679838154\r\nPlease
    read my comments on the image at Flickr for more information on that subject.\r\n\r\nRudolf
    Koch is an interesting source too, but his view on the subject is rather romantic
    and is closely connected with the attempts to re-establish what was called then
    \u2018Deutsche Schrift\u2019 (German letters) during the first half of the 20th
    century in Germany."
