body: So.  I got a new Power Book with Panther on it, and have been dealing with the
  throws of color managment recently. <BR> <BR>I just calibrated my monitor last night
  and what I have found is that though i would LOVE to use Adobe Photoshop 7&#39;s
  preferred RGB profile &#40;sRGBIEC6 etc....&#41; it seems to me that it is seriously
  oversaturated and too &#39;contrasty&#39;.  When I output graphics for web work
  they look very dull.  When I open those same graphics in PS, they look great. <BR>
  <BR>I have been testing these outputs on a bunch of different monitors around the
  office and I have concluded that it makes more sense to not use Color Management
  &#40;or use the Monitor RGB - Color LCD profile&#41; and deal with the reality that
  most other monitors aren&#39;t going to display my graphics like PS would have me
  believe. <BR> <BR>I would really like to hear your thoughts on the matter.  What
  has worked for you?  What profiles do you use?  If any. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Peter

  body: Thanks Daniel.  And I am recent subscriber to NAPP. <BR> <BR>But I am talking
    about the world of RGB.  I usually use Illustrator for print, and have that part
    taken care of.  It&#39;s just this RGB thing that is frustrating me. <BR> <BR>I
    will check out that article though.

  body: When you use that color profile in Photoshop on a Mac, it basically shows
    you the way it would look on a Windows display. When you view the graphic outside
    of Photoshop on a Mac, it will tend to look washed out.

    for the device, e.g., use a spectrophotometer to calibrate your monitor. You might
    look at GretagMacbeth

    oversaturated.'

    <BR> <BR>About two weeks ago I was ready to throw my crappy new iMac out the window
    because among other things its LCD screen represented color so poorly I was WAY
    feeling buyers remorse. <BR> <BR>The problem was the only adjustments you can
    make are brightness and gamma. Which results in super saturated, high contrast
    colors over a really bright or dim white. <BR> <BR>I called Apple service which
    were no help, I searched through the Apple forums, Adobe forums, and found there
    were NO solutions to speak of. <BR> <BR>I finally just decided to Google it and
    about 6 pages in found a post in a threaded discussion about a monitor calibration
    application called SuperCal. <BR> <BR>It is AMAZING! I now have perfect calibration,
    perfect outputs, and across the board. Give it a try and let me know what you
    think, I&#39;m honestly telling everybody about this app and am now going to keep
    the iMac. <BR> <BR>Check it out: <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/12756"

    than the Gretag stuff.

  body: thanks Stuart, will check it out. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know mark.  You are
    right about the effect on a Mac.  But when I was viewing the imagery on the 4
    PC&#39;s we had at the office, they looked washed out on there as well.  But if
    I use the Color LCD profile in PS, and design within that environment, then I
    get a better cross platform consitency. <BR> <BR>Anyways, time to invest in some
    calibration tools. <BR> <BR>Have a good weekend everybody.

  body: If you have Adobe Photoshop, there is a little utility packed with it called
    Adobe Gamma. It has wizard and manual mode to callibrate your monitor and allows
    to manually set the levels of Red, Green and Blue. It has proven quite useful
    to me, while the Pantone Spider has given no acceptable result, as it does the
    callibration according to some imagined &#34;standard&#34;, but I need to adjust
    the colors so that they&#39;d look the same as they come out from my printer&#39;s
    offset press. Adobe Gamma does that pretty well.

    wide.  ICC stands for International Colour Consortium. <BR> <BR>Anyway, the Spyder
    is for monitor calibration, nothing else.  If the colours on your press are different
    it means you need to calibrate your press, which means you need a completely different
    tool.'
