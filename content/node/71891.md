body: "Have some trouble figuring out this typeface. The part of the image that says
  Kodak Timer. The timer is probably circa 1920s\u20141930s.\r\n\r\nMy best guess
  was Akzidenz-Grotesk Extended but the E doesn't match with the short crossbar and
  the Ks are not quite right. I'm also not sure if the extended version of Akzidenz
  was around in the 1920s or if that was added later on.\r\n\r\nImage attached. Larger

  body: "@typodermic I was thinking that as well but I couldn't understand why. I
    don't know much about how they worked with type at that time and whether or not
    they would have access to similar typefaces. They could have seen Akzidenz and
    redrew/modified it. But again, I don't know much about their process.\r\n\r\n@gillo
    I thought that originally as well but I chalked the spurs up to the quality of
    the photo.\r\n\r\n@johnnova That looks really close but the only difference I
    am seeing is that the crossbar of the A is lower than the terminal in the K\r\n\r\nI
    might get the clock in my hand and take a closer look at it. This is all mute
    because I don't need the typeface for anything but my father (a camera collector)
    is curious. Either way, still fun."
