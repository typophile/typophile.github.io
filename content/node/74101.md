  I'm designing for uni. It's nothing groundbreaking, and given the timeframe (3-4
  weeks), it is something that I will create, and then go back and refine when I am
  on my holidays.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I digress. I have 2 questions. \r\n\r\n1. Is it okay
  to use ball terminals on a sans-serif typeface? To give you an idea of what style
  I want to create, think something similar to Bodoni or Didot, minus the serifs.
  \r\n\r\nand 2. Say hypothetically I use a ball terminal on the letter 'f', does
  that mean I have to carry it through with the other letters that would have one
  too? like r, a, c etc? (should also note that I am only doing the lowercase, as
  we were only asked to do either upper or lower and numerals)\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"

    but also minus the high contrast.\r\n \r\n2) Yes.\r\nTake an ink pen, the one
    that pours ink on paper when you don't move your hand. Draw these letters with
    one second of debt.\r\n\r\n1+2) Manage the resulting crisis, according to the
    effect that you want to achieve."

  body: "My feeling is that a ball terminal (or any particular terminal convention)
    usually exists not merely as a style of \"decoration\" but also a functional way
    to add a particular kind of weight to that stroke. And I can imagine an /a/ and
    an /f/ in the same font that would have rather different needs for weight at their
    tops. In that case, identical terminals for consistency's sake wouldn't be particularly
    desirable. \r\n\r\nIn my experience, a close look at successful fonts often reveals
    more inconsistency in terminal treatments than I expected to find."

  body: "How can it be a sans-serif typeface if it has balls?\r\nBall terminals are
    a kind of serif.\r\n\r\nLook at Archer and Bodoni Egyptian.\r\nThey are monoline
    faces with ball terminals, but also serifs, slab in fact.\r\nImagine them without
    the straight serifs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps something like Sari manages the integration,
    mixing balls with rounded \"plain\" terminals, due to greater contrast of stroke
    thickness.\r\n\r\nBut if you're following a hard-edged didone model, perhaps the
    answer is small balls.\r\n\r\nExperiment and see what works!"

  body: "[i]Ball terminals are a kind of serif.[/i]\r\nIndeed. But only when we trace
    the outline stroke. The skeleton of letters with ball and teardrop terminals usually
    behaves like that in a sans-serif.\r\n"
