  a number crunshing finance guy) I have tortured my brain over the layout of a business
  card for a newly established company in the finance sector and would like to get
  your views on some questions plus any helpful criticism. \r\n\r\nThe logo consisting
  of a [graphical element] + \"Syntaxis capital\" [serpentine] is set. The card should
  be easy on the eye and convey a professional look and feel. \r\n\r\nQ1: I have not
  been able to find examples for bcard where the logo (containing wording) is rotated
  against the information block. I believe this makes the logo appear more graphical
  and should also improve recognition without diminishing seriousness (see Verdana
  upper right vs left side)\r\n\r\nQ2: if I keep the logo in the upper right corner
  should the information block align with the left of the logo wording or with the
  graphical element (actually the lower left corner of the graphical element) (see
  franklin gothic logo ailgnment)\r\n\r\nQ3: does it matter to mix serif for the name/title/info
  block with sans-serif for the logo wording (see serif vs. sans-serif)\r\n\r\nQ4:
  is it my personal impression that for serif types Bodoni is more elegant in the
  bcard context than Georgia? (see serif types Bodoni vs Georgia)\r\n\r\nThank you
  for your comments and ideas\r\n\r\nThomas\r\n"

  body: "Q1 I don't agree, the alignment should be the same\r\nQ2 Align on the logo
    wording\r\nQ3 It is quite acceptable to have a serif or sans as long as they don't
    come to close to mimicking the logo\r\nQ4 Elegance is subjective but I would definitely
    lean toward Georgia in this case because the high contrast and the smaller x-height
    of a Bodoni are too much for the small size required for business cards\r\n\r\nIt
    looks to me that you have used a faux italic in some cases, please don't. Although
    both Verdana and Georgia were primarily developed for screen use they can work
    well for print. Out of the choices you provided I think that the Verdana upper
    right works best I would enlarge the logo from the top left to align the type
    with the text block and move the name vertically closer to the address block.
    Something to consider is that if you have a longer email address you will run
    over the edge of the card so look at moving the whole block to the left to allow
    plenty of space.\r\n\r\nHope this is of some help, to save the headache though
    you might be better approaching a professional designer.\r\nTim"

  body: "Tim \r\n\r\nthanks for the feedback. We will at some point certainly get
    a professional review of all collateral but at this stage our best effort will
    have to do... \r\n\r\nVerdana was actually also my preferred font. In regards
    to Q2 I am still struggling with the alignment because the rather \"slim\" graphical
    element in the logo seems somewhat out of place to me when positioned left of
    the text block. However, I will work on the size as you have suggested and see
    how that will impact it. \r\n\r\nThanks again, Thomas"
