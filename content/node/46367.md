body: "Does a typographer <em>need</em> to have a solid understanding of grammar?\r\n\r\nI
  think so. I used to work as an editorial assistant for a number of magazines, and
  now that I am doing graphic design, I am seeing the importance of marrying my knowledge
  of these two \"elitist\" trades.\r\n\r\nI am not a grammar pro, and I know I have
  lots to learn in regards to type; still I think that applying these knowledge bases
  in tandem makes one a better type user.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think??\r\n\r\nEvan\r\n<a

  body: Historically, no. I'd guess the workflow would have been author - editor -
    typesetter - proofreader, with grammar checking being the job of the editor? These
    days I wonder how many clients would appreciate having their grammar corrected
    by a designer? Not none? ;-)

  body: "\"<cite>Need</cite>\" have a solid understanding of grammar? Probably not,
    but editors and designers both make mistakes. Having a basic idea of what the
    other guy's job is about can help keep them to a minimum. Having a CMS on hand
    is even better. Knowing it intimately is better still.\r\n\r\nAnd that being said,
    watch out for egos. No one likes to hear that they've contributed errors, even
    if there's still time to fix them. "

    Or if you write your own ad copy. Aside from that, I\u2019ve grammar is best left
    to the editors so that they can deal with the authors."

  body: "A good typographer should be able to spell, should be able to parse out a
    sentence, should know principles of punctuation and syntax. A good typographer
    needs to know how language works, not just what it looks like. If we know how
    words work, we can make them look better and allow people to read them with greater
    ease.\r\n\r\n& a good typographer also needs to know how far to push the points
    about grammar he or she wishes to make to editors or copywriters. Be straightforward
    and steadfast when suggesting changes. Have evidence to back you up. & know when
    to fold 'em. Nasty turf wars can ensue otherwise. We do not need that; our jobs
    are tough enough. If you know you have made a good case for good grammar you shall
    sleep the sleep of the blessed. Even if they reject your ideas and mutter behind
    your back.\r\n\r\n& don't go around changing copy on your own. Always check.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "I echo what Will says. I think it is useful to be well acquainted with standards
    and techniques of good writing, as well as good typesetting. \r\n\r\nKnow your
    boundaries, however, and tread carefully into the editorial realm. Be sure of
    your footing. There is room to gain respect from editors, and that provides the
    currency for constructive conversations. But it has to be earned. You have to
    decide (or learn) if you have what it takes to play that game.\r\n\r\nBut I don't
    feel it's an absolute requirement for a good typographer.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking,
    a helpful typographer will serve better as a proofreader (i.e. catching out-and-out
    mistakes and inconsistencies) rather than as a copyeditor (i.e., suggesting rewrites
    and changes). That said, I come from a family of writers and editors and sometimes
    engage my editorial colleagues at that level. \r\n\r\nOn the flip side of this
    coin, however, is learning to give respect to and accept feedback from editors
    who likewise choose to educate themselves on graphic and typographic issues. The
    shoe is sometimes on the other foot, remember."

  body: "Will, that's an excellent description.\r\n\r\nJust today I checked on our
    intern's progress on a poetry book, and, while he's typographically well educated
    by now, I managed to point out a few errors -- by the author. Pretty minor ones,
    though; things such as \"the quote before <em>'Twas</em> should be a closing one\".
    And \"there should be three dots in an ellipsis -- not two or four\".\r\n\r\nPretty
    basic stuff, which could and/or should be picked up by a text editor -- if there
    is one! (There wasn't for this project.)\r\n\r\n<cite>& don\u2019t go around changing
    copy on your own. Always check.</cite>\r\n\r\n-- which I told him when he pointed
    out an error he saw all of his own, a misshapen sentence with dangling nouns and
    all. It being a poetry book, I tol'im, \"You can't always win. Leave that one
    to the author.\"\r\n\r\nFor a scientific book, I don't hesitate to correct all
    and any spelling and grammar errors I happen to notice. Those professors clearly
    had something else on their mind than proper spelling :-)\r\nAnd for really rough
    cases, I draw a large red rectangle around the offending text, with a side note
    \"Typesetter's notice: please check\". At that point, it's up to them to ignore.\r\n\r\nWhere
    can we download the [[http://www.design-police.org|Design Police stickers]] as
    proper PDF stamps? At least the \"Hire a copywriter\" and \"Run the spellcheck\"
    ones!"

  body: "It's not essential but it sure helps. I've had many editors say they like
    working with me because I have a good editorial sense. That's more than grammar
    of course, but I do pick stuff up and they appreciate that. Likewise I like working
    with editors who have a good visual sense.\r\n"

  body: "Also, knowing editorial marks can\u2019t be discounted. It is fairly specialized
    and most editors take serious time to clearly mark everything they need fixed.
    If you can pick up on a style and help with consistency all the better."

  body: "I think Will put it well.\r\n\r\nI suppose that in posting this I was referring
    to times when the type is linked to the grammar; ellipsis (3 periods with a space
    in between each one), an em dash (no spaces on each side like an en dash), rules
    of case, and so on.\r\n\r\nI think this is comparable to the benefit a graphic
    designer has when he/she knows something about photography. I am not a photographer
    <a href=\"http://evanmade.com/visualart.asp\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"some of
    my photography\">(sometimes I wish)</a>, but I know a little about it, and it
    helps.\r\n\r\nWill summed it up with, \"A good typographer needs to know how language
    works, not just what it looks like.\"\r\n\r\nGood thoughts overall.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nevan\r\n<a
