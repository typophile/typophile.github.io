  exactly are the benefits of having Helvetica in OpenType against TT, when (1) I

  body: "Kevin, to answer your question, there is no short-term need for you to license
    the OT version of Helvetica instead of the TT version.\r\n\r\nOT's benefits are
    often long-term, esepecially for customers in the US who primarially only design
    in English (or occassionally Spanish). Some OT fonts are packed with features,
    including extra ligatures, small caps, old style figures, etc. But Helvetica is
    not one of those. Helvetica's OT strong suit is language support.\r\n\r\nFonts
    are with us for years. Who knows what clients a designer will have five years
    down the line. Can you rule out that you'll never have to set a block of text
    in Hungarian, Polish, or Czech?"

  body: "Regarding languages: if you only need a few basic weights, the best language-supporting
    version of Helvetica is Helvetica World (on the Linotype website, you can find
    all three versions of Helvetica, in all available font formats).\r\n\r\nIt is
    a bit more expense, but Helvetica World is an OT font family whose fonts have
    enormous character sets. Inside are glyphs covering all Western, Central, and
    Eastern European languages that use the Roman alphabet (including Turkish and
    the Baltic languages). Vietnamese, with its stacked accents, is also supported,
    as are Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic. There are also some border-building
    ornaments in the character set."

  body: I'm able to purchase Helvetica Std in OpenType format, which is cheaper than
    Helvetica Pro, assuming I am not doing any foreign language work in the foreseeable
    future, should I plump for Std?

    to purchase Helvetica Std in OT over TT for, say, printing reasons?  \r\n\r\n(btw,
    Dan, if you ever are in Los Angeles on business, I owe you a few litres of beer)"

  body: "I don't think there is any visible difference between OT, PS, and TT outlines
    in print. Very old film makers might have problems, but that is unlikely. I think
    that the whole PS vs. TT thing has become more of an urban legend among designers.
    I seem to recall Adobe and Microsoft staff repeating in online forums again and
    again that the whole \"PS = Print and TT = Screen\" thing is a myth (although
    TT fonts can have better onscreen hinting).\r\n\r\nIf you buy the TT fonts, and
    you use a Mac, I'd recommend buying Mac TT and not PC TT. I know that you can
    install PC TT fonts on Mac OS X, but it isn't recommended, and I don't think that
    anyone offers you tech support on that; it is a work-around, not a solution. OT
    fonts, on the other hand, are really cross-platform."

    impression that PC TrueType fonts are, in fact, simply TrueType flavored OpenType
    fonts. Using your line of logic, OT fonts are also a work around. (Somebody correct
    me if I'm wrong!)"

    someday all these kinks with Apple and OpenType are ironed out! It seems to me
    that they're dragging their feet on really supporting the format well. Maybe they're
    planning to issue their own competing format in the future? :^/"
