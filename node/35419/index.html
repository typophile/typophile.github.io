		<div class="commentbody">Most monospaced fonts have their roots in the era of typewriters. Hence, I always find it a bit odd to find Courier & co. in a context completely different from what was possible with a typewriter; let’s say, in 72p display setting. Or justified. Or ‘beautifully’ kerned.
Same for leading. Some combinations of size and ledaing just scream ‘pomo’!
It depends. Maybe you want to show an image?</div>

However almost all digital type is 'pomo'. Think of all the digital  'revivals' that also contain '@' etc. It is as 'pomo' as Disneyland.
Monospace is not just used for typewriters, as I'm sure you know, it can be used for tabular systems too.

I think that monospace type is fair game.

Leading?

Yes, I fully agree with that. And you’re right about the Didone email adresses. :°) Still, I personally find it harder to stifle that ‘pomo!’-feeling with deracinated monospacers. But back to topic:
<cite>Leading?</cite>
What do you wanna hear? Percentage values? What typeface, line lenght, content, media? Monospace fonts in general—inherently—tend to form vertical columns, you’re certainly aware of that. So, maybe you want to increase the leading a bit to countersteer that phenomenon, if undesired.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The leading you use should be the result in part of line length, ascender height, descender height & x-height. There isn't a formula but a good place to start might be 1.20 of the pt size of the type. The longer the line of text the more pressure there is to add space to the interlinear space.

Some good places to look for more info are 'The Elements of Typographic Style' by Robert Bringhurst, and maybe search Typophile via google. For instance : http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20Leading There have been some excellent threads on this subject here as I recall. 

Line space for a mono will be trickier to do in the sense that a mono is always going to look more uneven to the eye with the dense m and the wide i and so on - which is distracting. But the principles are the same as for a non-mono as far as I can tell. 

Ultimately - trust your eyes no matter what I ( or anyone ) says.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would think that monospace type would generally require more leading than proportional spaced type. The reason would be that monospaced letterspacing feels more open and I would want to maintain a horizontal feel to a line so that rivers would not be so prominant. How much more? Only your eyes can tell.

		<div class="commentbody">The typeface I was using was Monospace Swiss 821 BT, at quite short line lengths.
I only really asked because the usual iterative process had failed; having stared at the type for sometime I started to doubt my preferences.
Increased leading definitely helped.

Florian I have images of you suffering Pomo type left, right and centre. I'm not so dissimilar myself! The worst is bitmapped Courier, blown up large, with all the imperfect impressions copied for 'typewriter effect'.

Thank you</div>
