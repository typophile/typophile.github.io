body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm, working on a bespoke wedding invitation at the moment, and
  the client needs about 20 of the 100 invites translating into Russian. She says
  that the Russian characters are cyrillic, and I know i have univers Cyrillic lurking
  around my machine somewhere.\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n1) Is this what i need
  to type Russian characters (i.e a font with a cyrillic version such as Univers)?\r\n2)
  If so, can anybody suggest any elegant, formal fonts that have a cyrillic version.\r\n\r\nI
  was initially looking at monoline fonts such as Pinocchio or Maline as these tie
  in nicely with the sailing theme in their rope-like appearance: \r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/trueblue/pinocchio/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/cubo/maline/\r\n\r\nso
  if there's anything similar to that then great. If not, just any nice looking ones
  will do.\r\n\r\nThanks very much\r\n\r\nDave"

    Cezanne Pro</a> both have Cyrillic character sets. Although you might prefer something
    more like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/paratype/slutsker_script_regular_cyrillic/">Slutsker</a>.
