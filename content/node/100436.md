body: "I am happy to finally announce the release of \"<strong>Lestatic</strong>\",
  my largest typeface project to date, and one with a slightly more serious take than
  usual from !Exclamachine. It is available exclusively through [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Lestatic/fonts/|myfonts.com]].
  The collection of 9 families and 27 styles includes a free mashup font to give a
  taste of the grungier sides of Lestatic. Also, for a limited time, Lestatic Lashed,
  a more stroked variant, is 75% off!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lestatic-preview-A_5234.png]

    obviously not be done by a \uFB01lter or whatever, and are a hand-made part of
    the type."

  body: "Thanks, Nick. I'm very happy with how the entire group came out! I am most
    interested to see how Sliced gets used. It reminds me of a super-grainy woodcut
    style, and I hope offers an effect like no other face out there.\r\n\r\nI actually
    used hand edits, then some filters, then hand editing all over again on Slashed
    and Sliced and even on Carved. Went a little over the time I had planned, but
    hey, that's nothing new in my projects. :)"
