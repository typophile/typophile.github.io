body: "Hello Typophiles\r\n\r\nAttached is the results of the first serious attempt
  I've taken to design a font, I'm 20 and a student studying Graphic Design, previously
  I have only really edited existing faces, (please be gentle, this is my first time
  at the rodeo).\r\n\r\nI've tried to make it kooky and memorable, while still having
  a consistent approach. This is a headline display font, hence how little stroke
  variation there is, and I think it can only go as small as 24pt before it gets too
  weird.\r\n\r\nI was inspired by a pair of unique street signs in my home town of
  Wellington, but through further development I found myself looking at the type used
  in the Tintin magazines of my childhood. I can also definitively say Colophone's
  incredible Raisonne and Grilli Type's entire catalogue were guiding hands as to
  the boundaries between feature and distraction that I'm trying to balance.\r\n\r\nFor
  some strange reason, I started with a bold weight. Will eventually move this down
  to Normal & Light.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think, dying to hear.\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: "The only person who it will feel memorable to is yourself.\r\n\r\nAs for
    my opinion on some glyphs, I'd say that the en dash, em dash and hyphen are too
    similar. I know you said this is a display face, but if you're going to include
    that stuff then you might as well make them awesome.  \r\nIt is odd that you still
    haven't decided on a name, imo.\r\n\r\nRest of it looks pretty boss.\r\n\r\nHere's
    my first typeface as well if you wanna check it out. I haven't made as much progress
    as you. http://www.behance.net/gallery/Leteske/7016789"

    spikes asterik is really strong, maybe 6 or 5 would be better."
