    However, there is some issues with the kerning on the \"O\" and the \"1\". Also,
    the numerals look a little smaller than the lowercases, so I guess they could
    be a little higher.\r\nAlso, the \"E\" on smaller sizes looks inverted.\r\nAs
    for resources for organizing your glyphs, sorry, can't be of any help.\r\nIt's
    a pretty nice, airy typeface, like it a bunch."

    logic for designing this way was cutting after the extreme of the curve as opposed

    feel I needed to cut each terminal at the same point or also, importantly, in
    the same direction. I know that sounds really inconsistent but it generates four
    possible endings as opposed to one. Two possible terminals (before and after the
    extreme of a curve) makes complete sense to me.\r\n\r\nI'm not really ready to
    show my drawing, but I hope you understand what I mean. If not I will try to illustrate
    what I mean. To apply my description to Frode's type sample the terminal in 2
    is cut after the curve has reached it's extreme but 6 is cut before. The terminal
    of the 2 is also cut at an angle, the 6 is not. Two variables, each employed at
    once. To make it more logical as Tomi puts it might be to vary only one of these
    options.\r\n\r\nSorry that was such a mouthful, I'm not very well, and a bit nervous
