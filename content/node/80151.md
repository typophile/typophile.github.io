  have, but I have a dubt, I can't understand why for example in the Clarendon Text
  font the alternate ligatures are not in the same file of the file of the text. It's
  quite an inconvenient situation, because when I use some Canadian Type if I want
  to set my text with alternate ligatures I can't do it in a easy way in illustrator
  or in indesign, but I must search and replace the couples of letters that need alternate
  ligatures...\r\nwhy they made font files so strange?!?!?!\r\ndo you have the same
  problem with fonts from Canadian Type?!?!??!\r\n\r\nthank you for your attention\r\nSwanina"

    or Microsoft, the owner actually lists his phone number at the web site, so you
    can call him up and bitch in person.\r\n\r\nI suspect there is a very straightforward
    explanation."

    Shinn, you are confusing me. You convinced me that Adobe and Microsoft weren't
    foundries, yet now you refer to them as foundries. Have you ever considered a
    career in politics?"

    I had wondered whether to put \"foundries\" in quote marks, but thought that might
    be a bit too snarky, as my comment was already enough of a dis. "
