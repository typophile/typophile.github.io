  in (biblical) Hebrew and Greek. If possible I'd like to steer off the beaten path
  and use a webfont. Do you know of any webfonts that offer this kind of language
  support? \r\n\r\n[I initially thought of Gentium, which would be a great choice,
  but the webfont version only includes the Latin alphabet.]\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for your help.\r\n\r\nEDIT: just noticed Gentium does indeed include WOFF files
  for Gentium Plus, but I'm trying my best to avoid self-hosting the files. Still,
  I guess there's my first typeface for the list. Any others?"

  body: "When you go outside the Big Three (Latin, Cyrillic, Greek)* you're severely
    limiting your stylistic choices by demanding that a single font handle everything.
    You might be lucky to find <em>one</em> typeface that has all the scripts you
    need, and it probably won't be the style you want. And anyway, especially if you
    get into the more exotic NB3 scripts trying to match the style can become more
    damaging than useful.\r\n\r\n* OK, new term suggestion: NB3 (non-Big_Three). Use
    it or lose it.  :-)\r\n\r\nHere's an approach that I think works: start with the
    NB3 script, which will have the fewest fonts; find one that works; find a B3 typeface
    that harmonizes; but if the NB3 is too distant from the B3 it's better to split
    up the B3 (so it's not like the B3 is a clique). And if you have to support more
    than one NB3 script then: you might need to compromise both choices a little bit;
    and it's much more likely you'll have to split the B3 choices.\r\n\r\nThen there's
    the issue of hierarchy: quite often the various scripts aren't supposed to be
    equally important, and one (or more) could be subordinate in style. Ideally you
    want a \"multilateral\" system with both parallel and hierarchic branches. Of
    which there's still only one...  :-)\r\nhttp://www.granshan.org/works/2008/hrant.pdf\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "@hrant:\r\n<cite>First thought: Why do you have to use the same typeface?</cite>\r\n\r\nPresumably,
    avoiding the need for font commands avoids the need for specialized software for
    preparing the blog - the text can just be typed in, changing to a Hebrew or Greek
    keyboard as necessary.\r\n\r\nI thought there was an <em>obvious</em> solution:
    TeX Gyre Termes. This supports not just Latin, Hebrew, and Greek, but also Cyrillic,
    Armenian and such languages as Thai, Burmese, Gurmukhi...\r\n\r\nI know it's just
    a dull old Times Roman clone, but because it's an open-source font, there's no
    issue with using it as a web font, and so it fills the bill ideally for the original
    poster's issue as stated.\r\n\r\n<em>However,</em> since the OP's issue involves
    Biblical Greek and not Modern Greek, there may be a requirement for typing <em>polytonic</em>
    Greek. In this case, the available options may be considerably more limited, and
    considering a separate typeface for Greek may be required.\r\n\r\nThis, of course,
    is also the case if it is desired to type Hebrew with vowel points and perhaps
    even cantillation marks. However, while TeX Gyre Termes lacks polytonic Greek,
    it does have at least the basic vowel points for Hebrew."

    Hmmm, so you might need to strip the Latin out of the font (or pull the non-Latin
