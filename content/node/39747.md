  body: "> Space between letters is important too, no?\r\n\r\nCorrect. But at that
    time 3 decades ago (starting in 1977 with Apple I), the dot matrix referred to
    the visible dot matrix only, because the text characters were generated by hardware,
    a so-called type 2513 character generator. The old Apple II manual says on page
    96: \"The seven rows in each character are scanned by VA, VB, and VC signals,
    and the output of the character generator is serialized into a stream of dots
    by a 74166 at location A3. This bit stream is routed to an exclusive-OR gate...\"
    Am I to continue this Wozniak jargon?"

  body: "Ridiculously late, but I just came across this.\r\n\r\nFlorian, thanks for
    referencing the SIGNA issue. Indeed \"pixel fonts\" are hardly a modern invention
    :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the original question, AFAIR there is no historical 5 by
    8 units example in the SIGNA issue. In fact, the vast majority especially of the
    \"older\" faces that I found have a cap height with an odd unit count.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    it would likely be an impossible task to find \"the definitive oldest one\" such
    alphabet; this stuff is quite tedious to research anyway, as the sources for this
    are scattered across so many fields (if they have even survived that is). There's
    not exactly a \"center of pixel type design\" out there that collects this stuff
    in a central location, sorted by cap height. Though I still dream of that. \r\n\r\nAs
    the original poster was looking for something with a fixed, orthogonal grid (so
    e.g. mosaics in the traditional sense don't count), a good bet would likely be
    checking out historical cross stitch manuals (although you'd have to be lucky
    to find eight stitch letters because letters with a seven stitch cap height were
    hugely popular; see page 37 of SIGNA 10 for some examples of these).\r\nQuickly
    looking through my archive, I found one cross stitch example of glyphs with an
    eight stitch cap height, but they're only numerals, and also not old (1984), although
    I assume it revives older models.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/8pxcrossstitch_4108.jpg]\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAnother
    field to look into may be the tiny embossed \"dot matrix\" alphabets for the blind,
    which were popular in Europe before the inception of the Braille system (and even
    afterwards). These are highly interesting faces, but descriptions of what they
    actually looked like (or felt like, rather) are excruciatingly hard to find. The
    only one I managed to get my hands on was this one by Braille himself, done in
    1839 (my visualization based on the original data). It has a 7 dot cap height,
    but there are other such faces too; apparently there was one used in Belgium that
    had a 5 dot cap height! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/raphi_3886.gif]\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI
    have a fantastic book showing really old examples of embroidered alphabets somewhere,
    but I can't find it right now. Let me know if anyone is still interested in this
    \u2013 I could dig that up and see what I can find."
