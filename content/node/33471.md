  Adventures in Wonderland</a> as an experiment, I would now like to start a second
  book project. I am looking for a new challenge -- something with different requirements
  from <em>Alice</em>.\r\n\r\nYou are invited to help me choose a the text for the
  project. This text should be in the public domain and of a reasonable length --
  the complete works of Shakespeare or the Bible would, therefore, not be appropriate
  suggestions. I will consider works for which illustrations in the public domain
  are available if the illustrations have a different function from the one's in <em>Alice</em>,
  e.g., if they are an integral part of the text."

    very short, book. Something a more lengthy but still uber-cool would be <em>Paradise
    Lost</em>, although you might be so sick of Milton\u2019s endless supply of pretentiousness
    that you\u2019ll stop after book one."

    shorter poems.

  body: "Thanks a lot for the suggestions -- they're all very welcome.\r\n\r\nI think
    perhaps <em>Gulliver's Travels</em> wouldn't be different enough in the sense
    that it's also a romance for about the same demographic (originally, anyway).
    Poetry might be an interesting challenge; if anyone has other suggestions to make,
    now is the time. Beowulf and Chaucer are <em>way</em> out of my league, though.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the story you've started to write, make it 25,000 words long and I'll consider
    it."
