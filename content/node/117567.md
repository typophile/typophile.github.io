    director Shaz Madani]]\r\n<blockquote>The title typeface is \u201Ca very slight
    alteration\u201D of Gerard Unger\u2019s [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/amerigo|Amerigo]],
    which has also been used throughout the first section of the magazine. \u201CWe\u2019ve
    removed some of the curves on the tapered strokes for sharper, more chiseled like
    serifs\u2026 This has been balanced with a softer more friendly sans serif. I
    love this sans font for all its small quirky imperfections that give it so much
    personality,\u201D</blockquote>"
