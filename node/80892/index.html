  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am working on an article about how to explain to clients why fonts and typography matter.

I have amassed a good array of facts, arguments and analogies over the years (though I always welcome more). What I’m really looking for are some good anecdotes about clients questioning the value of typography and fonts, and the dialogue you had with them. Is this a frequent or perennial problem for you?

To be quoted in the article it would be helpful for me to have your real name, and where you are based.

Regards,

One question before I start formally mining my memory: when you say "clients", are you excluding retail customers?

		<div class="commentbody">I can offer a story that might be colorful enough to possibly be worth including in your article - it involves a client waffling on the purchase of fonts. It was 1992 and I was among a rare breed of designer who had been successfully producing non-Latin fonts for the only low-cost video titling platform back then, the Amiga computer. One of my almost-clients was the main Iranian television channel in Los Angeles; they had been negotiating with me for my set of Arabic/Farsi video fonts for months. In November of that year I decided to move to Barcelona, so I called up Bahram and said "You might want to buy the fonts now, since I don't know if/when I'm coming back..." (which was actually true). In two days he came up with the $2000 cash; this was after all before the Internet age. In fact along with some other clients in the same position, he helped finance my 6-month stay in Spain! But then I ended up back in LA, to see my work on TV at any time of day* but also to realize that it was becoming more difficult to sell *quality* to clients, since many more people -some of them living in countries which much lower costs of living- were starting to make fonts...

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I'm in my early days of freelance working and I always rely on a strong and solid typographic basis for my works, this is why most of the time they are rejected by clients who prefer something fancy and colourful. And my clients are instutions, e.g. Italian Minister for Equal Opportunities, A.C.I. (Azione Cattolica Italiana, a catholic-related organisation).
There's a general urge for something that shouts the communication as louder as possible, confusing accessibility and clarity with mere visual pollution.
And I'm also noticing this is deeply related with the client's culture and cultural target.
I think a fine client will give me the time to explain why a solid typography is important. And he will eventually understand it (or he'd maybe understand me without explaining it all).

		<div class="commentbody">With graphic design clients, good explanations are obviously a plus, but as a practical matter I think it's more a factor of 1) picking the right clients (companies with reasonable budgets and who realize the importance of good design), and 2) developing a good professional relationship with them so they trust your recommendations.
