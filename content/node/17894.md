  body: It might be overused in the UK, but I still think this is one tasty type family.
    Totally yummy...

    I saw it I was surprised because the feel is much like what I have in mind for
    a  type project that should show up in the Critique section sometime this year.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again :)"

  body: Could that be a custom weight that's used on the magazine? I don't see it
    on the Veer website. Looks like a black, or ultra weight...

  body: "Yes, that is a weight of Nubian I didn't do. I don't know who did, but I
    do know that only Brazilian Cosmo use it (thankfully). I can't say I'm entirely
    happy with the look of it. \r\n\r\nBut sometimes one designs a typeface and releases
    it, then it's in use in some ad campaign or other, and you think 'OH MY GOD! -
    Did I do THAT?' (I'm talking about Ryanair/Houschka.)\r\n\r\nIt might be overused
    in the UK - Huh? Where? I've hardly seen it anywhere. \r\nBut talking of overuse
    - Has anyone seen Brazilian Cosmo - it's the only typeface in the whole magazine.
    Too much!\r\n\r\nThanks for the praise Yves!\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

    that allowed by your EULA? I think I'd be kinda cross if someone added extra weights
    to a design of mine (in the highly improbable case I'd have designed a typeface
    of course)."

  body: "Thanks Chris.\r\n\r\nI think I will not approach them, as I don't really
    like going over old ground.\r\nHaving said that, I was working on adapted versions
    of one of my typefaces for nearly a year, and it can get ever so slightly tedious
    after a few months.\r\n\r\nBut I've so much NEW stuff that I never get to finish
    off anyway, fortunately I'm in the position of usually having too much work, so
    it looks like it will be ages before I shall be able to release any of my own
    new stuff.\r\n\r\nAlso I have a strict policy of no evening or weekend work as
    I want to relax occasionally too! (nor do I want to go blind staring at a screen
    24/7).\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: Makes sense Nick, not going over the old ground. I've been wanting to implement
    a no evenings/weekends policy myself, but haven't been able to do it yet. As far
    as your new stuff goes I understand. I've been wanting to design a typeface for
    ages, and I've got probably 50 pages of sketches and ideas, but my graphic design
    work is paying the bills, so it has to wait I guess...
