  body: I like the idea that you have, but the execution is a little off - the horizontal
    "stripes" cut out of the B seem skewed or distorted, and the cap on the beacon
    has really thin line work that's out of place here.  Can you simplify it?  What
    other symbols or emblems suggest this object without requiring specific details
    like the beacon's cap?

  body: Sorry to say it, but for me the B in the logo resembles more the number "3".
    Maybe you should separate the silhouette of the beacon from the type with a thin
    line with the background color or something, just to be sure that nobody gets
    in such confusion...

  body: "I think this can be really nice, you\u2019re of to a good start here. But
    I also think the B looks too much like the number 3. So you might want to try
    and find away around that. RedMonolith also had a good point regarding the thin
    lines at the top of the beacon."

  body: I'm not so sure you need the big B. Try it with just the beacon and the type
    below.

  body: "The thin lines are to indicate the rail work on the lighthouse. I realize
    they do feel out of harmony with everything else having so much mass. I couldn't
    seem to say lighthouse without putting the light on top. I did try a version with
    just a black circle above the diagonal lines taking away the thin lines and the
    black square, but was talked out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething beautiful and something
    ugly almost always works."

  body: I think what throws me is that the beacon portion of the lighthouse is rounded
    to suggest dimension, while the bottom striped section isn't.  If you rounded
    the stripes a bit, that might make the contrast with the "B" better.  I read a
    "B" right away, as the name Beacon is right below it.  Nice concept, just needs
    a bit more tweaking.
