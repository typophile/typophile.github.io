body: Would you please help me to identify ALL the fonts used to create this post
  card. I've been asked to help with the design for the website and I'd like to use
  the same fonts if possible.

  body: CASFAA appears to be Univers Bold Condensed; Calgary, AB is Univers Condensed.
    The script looks like a freeware font called Saginaw, which I am certain is a
    knock-off of something else, but the name escapes me at the moment...

  body: Thank you for your response. Saginaw is close but not exact. I was thinking
    of substituting with it if we can't find the exact font. Under "the script" you
    mean "Believe It! Achieve It!" as well as "2011", correct?

  body: 2011 is another script entirely, but I'm not familiar with it. I believe that
    the "Believe It, etc." has been manually backslanted a bit, which may explain
    why it doesn't appear to match Saginaw.

  body: Freebie Saginaw is copyright free because it's an illicit release of an early
    version of Treacyfaces' Saginaw.
