  been working on it for a short while now. It&#39;s basically a complete overhaul
  of my brothers font, Slick 69, which I always seemed to use quite a bit of when
  I was designing any surf related stuff. I always swore I was gonna redesign it the
  first chance I had cos&#39; I really think it&#39;s got some interesting characters.
  Anyway, I just really liked it and I like my bro&#39; too! <BR> <BR>I need your
  help tho&#39; cos&#39; I can&#39;t see the wood from the trees anymore. I&#39;m
  just not sure on a lot of the characters and I don&#39;t know whether everything
  needs to be toned down a bit or cranked up a notch! I guess I just need some motivation
  and some advice from the wise &#39;jedi counsel&#39;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, here are
  my initial sketches...go mad! '

    loop of the K is closed on the title &#40;making it look like an R&#41; but open
    lower down. '

  body: ' this is a great one. <BR> <BR>You have putten up the letters with exact
    billiance &#40;and a most interssting order.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;">  &#41; <BR> <BR>How about the star/&#42; letter, why not expand
    it, it is maybe a little bit thin when it goes with the rest of the char-set.
    <BR> <BR>Keep up the good work. '

  body: Hello, Brode, I&#39;ve always been a fan of your work with Sacred Nipple!
    <BR>To be honest I never liked so muck Slick69 but it seems you&#39;ve reworked
    it in a really remarkable way in this new version. <BR>Honestly, it works great.
    My only observation &#40;coming also from Slick69&#41; is that the lower legs/stems
    of R, K, r, k, j, y et al shoud be better reserved as alternates to me. <BR>If
    you put non-swashed versions in the set you will probably get a stronger harmony,
    while the Swashed ones could be useful for beginnings and endings or for a more
    economic use &#40;the ones pointing right clashes with the ones pointing left,
    that&#39;s the &#34;problem&#34; I see&#41;. <BR> <BR>Keep up your fantastic work.
    Sooner or later I&#39;ll have to purchase that issue of i-Jusi devoted to type.
    <BR> <BR>BTW, iAlfabhethi, iZulu and Rural, among the most recent Nipple types,
    are strokes of genius &#40;also the names&#41;. Holier used to be one of my favorites
    and Birthriot is a really beautiful different take on P. Scott Makela&#39;s Dead
    History. Shoe Repairs is one of the most beautiful &#34;naif&#34; lettering samples
    turned into type.
