body: "Its actually pretty difficult to explain. I was wondering if someone would
  be generous enough to open up iChat, add my user name: Britishdancparty, and IM
  me so that we can talk about it? Its a pretty complicating problem and Im mainly
  looking for someone who can give me an honest opinion + design idea..\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I would, but the idea is just so... big. I think It'll be easier if I'd explain
    it in parts; Ichat.

    this the wrong way, but 30 mins w/o any info is a bit much. i would want to know
    if i would even be helpful before plunking time. you can hit me up offline."
