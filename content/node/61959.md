body: "When setting up kerning classes in FontLab Studio, how do I make use of those
  left/right checkmarks? I read the manual but I don't understand how I can make practical
  use of them.\r\n\r\nLet's say I've defined the capital A as a kerning class for
  all accented A's. Like this:\r\n\r\n_kern1: A' Adieresis Aring Agrave Atilde Acircumflex
  Aacute Amacron Abreve Aogonek\r\n\r\nHow can I apply the left A kerning to the AE?
  I've always just done a copy from A and paste special, left kerning on the AE. It
  works, but I'd like to do it with classes\r\n\r\nI can see that I can define a whole
  new kerning class and have it apply to only the left or right side. But the A already
  has a class defined, I can't define another class for A: it already has a class.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nI meant it would far more intuitive to mark the side by which you are
    grouping for, i. e. if you are grouping O, C, G because they are round on the
    LEFT side you should check the LEFT checkmark, not the other one, as it is today.
    According to this, FL should be capable to understand that if a group is marked
    on its left side it is going to be used as the second letter on the pair (or the
    first one, if it is a right-to-left script).\r\n\r\nWhen I try to explain kerning

    the other person always get it wrong because of this."

    on the LEFT side then it means they will share the same kerning value if they
    are the 2nd glyphs in the pair. In right-to-left scripts, if glyphs are identical
    on the RIGHT side then it means they will share the same kerning value if they
    are the 2nd glyphs in the pair. \r\n\r\nIn both cases, the 2nd checkbox needs
    to be activated. It would be far too complex from the UI standpoint to somehow
    make sure that the checkboxes relate to the left or right side of the glyphs,
    because that depends on the direction of the script. But if you think about the
    logical order of the glyphs in the kerning pair, one is always 1st and the other
    is always 2nd, and this is what the checkboxes reflect. I'd be happy to hear your
    suggestions how to improve this, provided that the solution will be workable for

  body: "Hi Adam, one way to deal with this is defining classes by left/right side
    of glyph logic, regardless of glyphs' writing direction. Setting a left flag means
    that glyphs' left sides are similar. Always. Upon (kern) feature generation, lookups'
    LTR/RTL flag determines whether the translation is left=2nd & right=1st, or right=2nd
    & left=1st. Not a big thing. In addition, source data for LTR/RTL kerning should
    be defined and kept independently of each other.\r\nMalcolm, OT layout table's
    logic of 1st/2nd is layout engine logic. There is nothing wrong with it. But personally
    I think that a left/right logic is more in tune with how designers think: left
    side of a glyph is the left side of a glyph, regardless of writing direction.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "That bullet in the middle has confused me a few times. \r\n\r\nThe way I
    think of it (when I have it right) is that the bullet represents the glyph that
    the class is kerning against. So, if you want the class to be considered when
    its members are on the left side of another glyph, click the left check box. But
    a few times I've got it inside out and thought the bullet represented the members
    of the class, and the check boxes represented the other half of a kerning pair,
    either on the left or on the right, which is backwards. \r\n\r\nMost of the time
    I get it right--er--correct. But I think it would be less confusing if the bullet
    in the middle were removed. Just have the two check boxes, which would then clearly
    represent the two possible positions in a kerning pair with no third element to
    muddy the waters."

    make a very conscious effort to do it the FontLab way instead of the intuitive
    way every time. Obviously, I am not the only person who thinks left kerning means
    the space to the left of the glyph in question. Even after 5 years of doing it
    the FontLab way, I still find it very awkward and illogical. There may be an equal
    number of people in the world who think the FontLab way is logical--who knows.

    given it a fair amount of thought and decided that the way we have implemented
    it is more robust, especially in context of mixed writing directionality. I believe
    changing it now would confuse even more people (the ones who think it's intuitive
    as well many of those who don't think it's intuitive but have learned to deal
    with it). \r\n\r\nHowever, I think we can try to come up with a different graphical
    indication of \"the thing in the middle\" so it's more clear that it's the kerning
    pair that is indicated there (currently by the dot) rather than the glyph. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    set up in the font window, not in a separate dialog. You's switch into class mode.
    All the class parents would be highlighted. To make a new class parent, right
    click and create class parent. Select glyphs, drag & drop them on the class parent
    and they're added to that class. If a glyph already belongs to another class,
    it cant be selected. However, if you deselected and clicked on that glyph, it
    would reveal its parent the rest of the class it belongs to. For each glyph, you
    can turn off left of right kerning. Perhaps there could be a way to make the left
    belong of one parent and the right belong to another.\r\n\r\nThe classes wouldn't

    support and create your kern feature some other way (such as writing kern feature
    code directly in the OT panel or using an external tool such as Metrics Machine)

    Studio to simplify the internal storage of data (kerning pairs are \"attached\"
