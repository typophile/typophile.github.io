  body: 'Whether or not you choose to do spec work or whether this can be considered
    such &#40;and I would suggest that you seriously think about this - many here
    have talked about it before: <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16481.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16481.html</a> as
    well as participating in the Typophile contests too&#41;, Tanya has an excellent
    point:  <BR> <BR><b>Stay away from gradients.</b> <BR> <BR>Sure  they look cool,
    but gradients make things harder to see, read and reproduce. Especially letters.
    Gradients can cause problems when going to print. Gradients are hard to control
    in terms of colour matching. <BR> <BR>Choose one colour. The blue at the right
    hand side of the logo looks kind of neat... <BR> <BR>Speaking strictly about the
    work you are showing here: <BR> <BR>- What are you trying to show? Do you just
    want to make the letters look &#39;technical&#39;? Is it a requirement that the
    letters be used? Is there already a symbol? <BR> <BR>- The gaps in the letterforms,
    while not totally objectionable don&#39;t really seem to look consistent. Is there
    a rule that you could invent and follow about the gaps? <BR> <BR>- The logo seems
    to scale okay, which is one of the virtues of using sans-serifs if you need to
    go small. <BR> <BR>Additionally I can say from experience: you don&#39;t need
    to participate in a contest to get into the graphic design field. If you start
    designing things, even in a small way and study as much as you can you will find
    conversation and word of mouth can go a long way to establishing your reputation.

    <BR>the logo is for a group of bussines new technologies related. they have an
    old logo and they want to change it. <BR> <BR>
