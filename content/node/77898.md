  items is design a logo around the letters \"ff\". Since it is a publishing company,
  I thought a ligature would be perfect.\r\n\r\nProblem is I'm not super familiar
  with type. I've already spent way too much time searching through fonts. \r\n\r\nSeeing
  as you are all experts, I thought you might be able to make suggestions and help
  narrow my search.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: Most decent typefaces are going to have an ff ligature for you to work off
    of (or you can make a custom one easily enough). What kind of feeling are you
    going for with the mark? What kind of things does this publishing company do?
    That could be the difference between a really elegant italic or script ff and
    a bold sans serif ff.

  body: "The company publishes self-improvement books and some novels primarily in
    the online space. They are primarily online. I've been given creative license
    to develop the look and feel, so I wanted to try out a few different styles, but
    it will probably lean towards modern.\r\n\r\nI've considered a script font with
    the crossbar curving into a circle around the ligature, a weathered typewriter
    font, or a beveled sans serif.\r\n\r\nI was really hoping I could get some suggestions
    of fonts other people like to help me explore more possibilities. "

    and Faber</a> uses a ff-ligature for their logo. I think they may have had several
    versions over the years, or for different imprints.\r\n\r\n"
