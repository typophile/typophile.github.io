body: "Hello,\r\nI am a graphic designer with a great interest in and respect for
  type design, but I am not a type designer by any means.\r\nHere is my question:\r\nIt's
  my understanding that the original weights of Helvetica were expanded into more
  weight varieties (in the early 90s, I believe), the results of which included extremely
  thin \"hairline\" weights, and the whole family was named \"Helvetica Neue.\"\r\nJudging
  from the frequency that I see the ultra-light weights of Helvetica Neue used in
  design projects, the family must have been extremely profitable.\r\nSo why has no
  one done the same thing with other classic sans faces... i.e. made additional ultra-thin
  weights of Futura, Avant Garde, Optima, Akzidenz, etc.?\r\nI know that was recently
  done with Avenir... what about other fonts?  It seems like something almost guaranteed
  to be financially successful.\r\nIs it a legal issue? Is it a matter of type designers
  not being interested in something \"old\" like this?\r\nI, for one, would love to
  have more thin weights of some of these faces, and would happily pay for them.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any thoughts you have.\r\n\r\n-Rob\r\n"

    retro-fitted, but in general:\r\n\r\n- sometimes the foundry or designer doesn't
    think of it\r\n\r\n- sometimes the designer isn't interested, either because they
    think it doesn't make sense for the design, or because it is much more work to
    retrofit than to design it that way in the first place\r\n\r\n- it is very rarely
    a legal issue, except when licensing from one foundry to another is involved.
    So for example it would be a legal issue for Foundry A to extend a typeface that
    they license from Foundry B.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    mentioned 'ultra-thin.' Perhaps it comes down to the foundry/designer thinking
    it wouldn't be financially viable to have such an extreme weight. One of the reasons
    I've licensed individual styles of Proxima Nova is that I doubt I'll ever have
    much use for the lighter weights. I don't know that there is a huge demand for
    'ultra-thin' weights."

    the mystery face you refer to.\r\nAaron, I appreciate your suggestions, but I'm
    really looking for something I can use at very large sizes that still looks good...
    when used at very large sizes, these \"light\" weights look clunky and horsey
    in my opinion. \r\nThe ultra light weights of Helvetica Neue and Avenir Next (to
    pick two examples) look really amazing. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how much a type
    designer would charge to do this job for me if I commissioned, say, a hairline
    or \"ultra light\" version of Futura or Avant Garde?"

    would not revive a well-known sans.\r\nThere is more room for an original interpretation
    in reviving a serif face.\r\n\r\nI think you will find that there are many recent,
    new sans faces that are in the same genres as the faces that you mention, and
    which include Thin and Ultra Light weights. Why not use those?"

    yeah, they often look clunky and horsey and ... boring. I think to many type designers
    are horseshoing their types into a system (re: Univers) either by interpolating
    or by drawing a light, a regular and a black around the same rules and principles
    when they obviously have different needs. Looking at stuff up close will reveal
    it's inconsistencies, all the while text type is ALL about using those very inconsistencies
    too make even colour and rythm when viewed from a distance. Hello conflict!"

  body: Agreeing too, especially since a number of re-interpretations of the classics
    have been made during the past years which make it unnecessary to even think of
    expanding the old stuff ...
