  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">A bit of an announcement.

After on and off discussions over at the [[http://www.logopond.com|Logopond]] forums over the course of the past year, I have started a [[http://www.certtime.com|project]] to implement an online digital timestamping service. 

The idea is to provide an easy way to establish and validate a proof of existence of any given piece of data, such as an image, so that such proof could later be used to facilitate dispute resolutions. 

Specifically, the context of Logopond discussions was how to facilitate take-downs of the ripped-off logo designs. Having a reliable time reference for an original work seems to substantially simplify such activity. It may also serve as a deterrent and help to prevent the cloning from happening in the first place.

Timestamping is not rocket science, but its usefulness is generally affected by
<ul>
<li>the complexity of stamp verification process -- this typically requires the use of specialized 3rd party software
<li>the complexity of running a timestamping facility -- issuing a timestamp is easy, ensuring that the issuer cannot back-stamp at will is what's hard
</ul>

I have found a way to resolve both issues and make the whole process as straight forward as it can get. The details are [[http://logopond.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3578|here]] if you are interested.

I am posting this for two reasons. First, I want to obviously get the word out and announce the project. Second, I would like to gather the feedback. What do you guys think of the idea ? Not necessarily in the context of logos or images. Consider that <em>any</em> data can be timestamped.

The main difference is the reliability of the timestamp. Flickr, for example, allows editing the photo after it was uploaded, replacing the original and keeping the 'uploaded' date and time. Which makes sense because the photo was indeed <em>uploaded</em> on that date.

Secondary, lesser problem is that if I know someone in Flickr, I may potentially persuade them to change the timestamp by hand. 

In other words, Flickr and alike were not <em>built</em> for trustworthy timestamping. Their time reference information can be manipulated post factum, either using native features, through exploiting flaws in the system design or via social engineering.

On the other hand there exists mature timestamping infrastructure that is a part of digital certificate issuing business. The very foundation that makes the SSL secure. Timestamps are generated by the sealed servers, servers are physically secured, their security is routinely audited by 3rd parties, etc. The whole nine yards. The likelihood of the timestamp coming out of this infrastructure to be fake, manipulated or mis-applied is virtually zero.

The idea is to start utilizing this infrastructure by building a system that is dedicated to just one thing and that does it right.

Initially it is going to focus on images and related types, i.e. PNG/JPEG/etc and AI/PSD/PDF/etc. This has more to do with implementing the Preview/Thumbnail functionality rather with any technical issues with stamping process.

The project is now alive and breathing.

I had serious doubts along the way and almost scraped it once or twice. However in the end it seemed like an interesting experiment and a generally good thing to do, so it survived. 

I should probably add here that the goal is not to make money. The goal is to try and do something about rampant online plagiarism. This is not an ultimate solution, far from it, but it is one of those small things that could help, and help substantially.

Now I crave for feedback. 

If you think it's a dumb idea and it won't work, I would like to hear that. Especially that. If you have thoughts on what could make it work, please type them and post them.

The homepage is at https://beta.certtime.com

I have put together a comprehensive Q&A page that covers all FAQs accumulated so far - https://beta.certtime.com/faq. If there are more questions that beg to be there, do let me know.

If you feel like taking the service out for a test, punch in <em>AUGUST</em> as an invitation code when registering. Do keep in mind that it is a work in progress and parts of the site are still being worked on.</div>
