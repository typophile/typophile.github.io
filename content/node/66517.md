  subscription model (exception for Typotheque) and the unreliable browser rendering.
  Both makes me uneasy about using web fonts for anything but playing around. \r\n\r\nHave
  any of you actually relied on @font-face in real life projects?"

    freely licensed stuff out there that makes the subscription issue less of an issue.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the lack of proper anti-aliasing (at least in Firefox) really turns me off still.

    a reminder: @font-face use doesn't require a third party service, so the only
    way to know - is to check the site's CSS.  Honestly I've been pleasantly surprised
    by the font stacks I've been seeing lately.\r\n\r\n "

  body: "I'm currently trying out a couple of weights of Fedra Sans Alt on <a href=\"http://www.ninastoessinger.com\">my
    own site</a>, as sort of a test. It seems that rendering quality on Windows is
    a real issue? I must admit I'm not really up to date with all the background;
    to be on the safe [but still <em>somewhat</em> progressive :-) ] side, I think
    I'll limit it to titling at the moment, and only in situations of course where
    fallback fonts are also OK, so that the @font-face becomes sort of a \xABbonus\xBB
    for those people who can see it."
