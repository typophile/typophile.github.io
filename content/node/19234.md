    DT 2.</a>\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure, a few things don't really match!\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    It could be Vigor with the  <cite>A</cite> crossbar lowered,  bottom-right serif
    on the <cite>k</cite> stem snapped off and the ascender serifs customised."

  body: It appears that Dav has identified it as Vigor in a <a href="http://typophile.com/node/13096">previous
    thread</a>. But it isn't Vigor, it's probably custom as Stephen has mentioned
    above. It is similar but a lot of the forms are different such as the bowl of
    d.
