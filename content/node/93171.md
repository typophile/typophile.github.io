  me, this is not a plain rip-off of [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=wisdom%20script|Wisdom

  I, or MyFonts, do about it?"

    And did or did they not ask permission?

    have no trouble getting Thirsty Script removed from MyFonts (although it would
    certainly help your case if Wisdom were on MyFonts). We saw that sort of thing
    happen recently (in fact due to \"activism\" here on Typophile).\r\n\r\nHowever,
    since Thirsty is -by your own gracious admission- an improvement on Wisdom there
    might be another way to both reward at least that part of the effort, and acquire
    proceeds that you're entitled to: get Yellow to pass along maybe 50% of the sales.
    BTW if such an amicable resolution does work out make sure it becomes public information
    (although the percentage can remain private).\r\n\r\nSpeaking of things like karma,
    even if you might not care too much about the money (as indicated by your Honorware*

  body: "Hi guys, thanks for the thoughtful discussion around this topic.\r\n\r\nIt's
    true, I'm working on putting more information out there about the design and process
    behind each of my fonts, and Wisdom Script was my first release. \r\n\r\nI am
    a little bit unsure of what action to take (if any) on this typeface. I emailed
    the designer a bit, and he admits that Wisdom Script was the primary inspiration.
    It's obvious to me that he just set out to improve upon my design. Which he did,
    I admit that. \r\n\r\nI wasn't referencing anything in particular when i was drawing
    it, I just wanted it to work well on an incline, and because I was [[http://woodsofwisdom.info/|cutting
    all the shapes out of balsa wood with an exacto knife]], the sides of each lowercase
    letter were straight (it's easier to cut straight, going with the grain of the
    wood, than to cut a curve). The capitals in Wisdom are a sort of geometric interpretation
    of my handwriting, which is influenced by any number of different typefaces, lettering
    styles, signs, and logos.\r\n\r\nMost of the letters in Thirsty Script are rooted
    in Wisdom's design. I've heard that if more than 30% of a piece of work is referencing
    another work, then that is stealing. About 75% of Thirsty Script seems to reference
    Wisdom, if I were to make a wild guess.\r\n\r\nHe did not credit Wisdom at all,
    or ask for permission. Is it worth the effort/ bad karma to go after Thirsty?
    Or is it actually good karma because I'm taking a stand for my work? These are
    questions that I have not made up my mind about. Any opinions you guys have to
    offer would be sincerely appreciated. Thanks again for posting this. It's an honor
    to be part of a community that values creativity, and artists' rights."

  body: "Thanks James for commenting\r\n\r\nI certainly think that the least you should
    get is a percentage, and otherwise have it taken down. And you should also demand
    to be credited for the design. IMHO the work done on the design might make it
    better (language support, complete character set) but the design is very much
    yours. The weights are automatically interpolated, without much optical refinement,
    so there is not much original design in there. I don't think it is kosher to go
    about this way by Yellow, making money with your design.\r\n\r\nEven if the design
    is improved, there are still other ways to do this, for instance Roger Nelsson
    has Cheap Pro Fonts (hate the name...but still) which creates improved and expanded
    versions of free fonts (I know yours is not free in this sense), but always does
    so with permission, with all credit to the original designer, under the original
    name (I don't know if the designers get a percentage, but others here should be
    able to provide info on this, (Oldnick?))\r\n\r\nI hope there is a way to resolve
    this without removing Thirsty, it's up to you, but I think you should at least
    take action, even if only for ethical reasons..."

    can ask MyFonts to pull the plug."

  body: "Hi- I'm a little late to the discussion, but I'd like to throw my 2 cents
    in anyway. I'm the designer of Thirsty Script.\r\n\r\nI have to admit I've made
    some mistakes in this process and definitely should have handled things differently.
    James and I have worked out an agreement and Thirsty Script is back up on MyFonts
    and Fontspring. \r\n\r\nI'd just like to say my intentions with Thirsty Script
    were absolutely not to \"rip off\" Wisdom Script, or to make a quick buck on his
    efforts, etc. Originally my thought was to try and marry the edginess of Wisdom
    with the roundness and approachability of Lobster and mix in my own sensibilities
    and innovation to create something new and unique. \r\n\r\nOn its release I felt
    like I was successful in doing this, although in hind-sight I admit to being a
    little myopic. The hostility that Thirsty Script garnered definitely took me by
    surprise, and I think this is a tribute to James' passionate following. Truth
    be told I'm a bit offended when Thirsty is referred to as a \"plain rip-off\",
    and I think if someone takes the time to really compare the fonts and their shapes
    and their differences they wouldn't feel this way. \r\n\r\nThat being said, at
    the same time I do understand James' objection, as maybe the finished product
    is too close for comfort, and I'm happy we've reached an agreement as Wisdom Script
    certainly did provide much of the inspiration for Thirsty Script. "
