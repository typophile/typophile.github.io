    the Display version may be used for drop caps. And Swash caps also make for interesting
    drop caps, breaking the grid.\r\n\r\nMany (if not all) of Goudy\u2019s \u201Chand
    tooled\u201D styles are available as fonts with complete upper and lower case,
    not just caps.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve made a few fonts that \uFB01t the bill here, Richler
    Highlight and Walburn Tooled (no lower case), and Bodoni Egyptian Shadow:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mms_6160.png]"
