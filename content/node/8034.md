body: Hello! <BR> <BR>I went back to the er... drawing board with my &#34;Trajic?&#34;
  post &#40;note the name &#34;Trajic&#34; has been taken by Hrant. H. Papazian already
  :-S &#41; and have produced this font. I am currently using the working title &#34;Minque&#34;
  now for this font. <BR> <BR>So, on to the font then. <BR> <BR>I have added stroke
  contrasts and bifurcated &#40;?&#41; the serifs to correct optical problems with
  the O. The bifurcation gives it a different texture to Trajan, but I&#39;m not really
  following it any more anyway. &#39;Twas merely the beginning. <BR> <BR>Do you think
  I could add a lower case, or perhaps have a small caps? small caps would seem to
  be more in the tradition of the Trajan typeface if I am using it as a &#34;guide&#34;.

  body: The bifurcation seems pretty distracting to me, although I don&#39;t think
    there&#39;s a way to do it well &#40;without going to gray&#41;. <BR> <BR>Your
    forms are nicely Trajanlike though... except that damn &#34;X&#34; again, eh?!  :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Hmm, maybe it&#39;ll have to be gray. That might cure the X problem I just
    can&#39;t figure out. But, y&#39;know, as it reaches the point of completion it
    may be self-defeating, with the grays for this face. It might just be &#34;small
    trajan, well-hinted&#34;. <BR> <BR>I wonder if there&#39;s a thread devoted to
    pixel x&#39;s anywhere. Or like a website. Hmmph. Theyre a lot easier to do with
    1 pixel widths. <BR> <BR>Either way I think it may be time for me to get back
    to conentional type design anyway. At least for a breather from the restrictions
    of pixels. <BR> <BR>Either that or go gray...

  body: 'please note that i am no typographical historian. in fact, i&#39;m not even
    a hack historian. so take my opinion here with a grain of salt: this font looks
    to me like something i&#39;d see in a knight and princess graphic, or a knight
    and dragon graphic, or a man in a tunic and green tights... <BR> <BR>it has an
    old english feel to me. it is easy to see the difficulties this direction holds
    for you, but kudos on making the experiment. <BR> <BR>keep going.'

  body: Hmm, I did not see that font before now, except for Gardot, of course. I think
    he does quite well looking at the first list of the alphabet at the link you posted,
    Raph. <BR> <BR>However, I should have guessed that he had done this face in addition
    to Garadot. Still, good practice and learning for me. <BR> <BR>Tyler, hah! You
    are definitely right about the fantasy thing. Oh well.

  body: "This really belongs under the \"Bitmap/Display\" category, but I've selected
    it for the first Typophile <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14678\">Critique
    Thursday</a> anyway.\r\n\r\nI really enjoy what Chris has done here. But I would
    make the design more Roman-y.\r\n\r\nThe top serifs on the \"E\" and the \"F\"
    are too distracting, I think."

  body: "it's interesting to me that, at a glance, the design 'feature' you built
    this font around was the bifurcation. yet, it ends up holding the design back.\r\n\r\nthis
    always seems to be way of things. the reasons you have for starting something
    are rarely the reasons you have for finishing the very same endeavor.\r\n\r\ni
    like the design. i like the 'R' the most and the 'S' the least.\r\n\r\nif you
    don't like the irregular quality of your 'O' and 'Q', then i'd recommend just
    building different 'O's and 'Q's at different sizes until you find a height the
    works geometrically for those characters. by that i mean, there is enough space
    to allow smooth curvature.\r\n\r\nthen, double back and match the rest of the
    set to that cap height. it'll be hard to maintain the character of the font exactly,
    because of the strict nature of the pixel grid. but that's what pixel fonts are
    all about, right?\r\n\r\nthe management of curvature imperfections."
