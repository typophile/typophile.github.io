  era book. Whilst it does not need to be totally faithful to the designs of that
  time I'd like to make sure it has the correct feel.\r\n\r\nAs you all seem to know
  much more than me on this forum can you recommend any good typefaces to use for
  the body copy of the book? I've been looking through many books in the local library
  to understand the style, typographical features, punctuation etc but am not sure
  of the names of fonts.\r\n\r\nAlso do you have any suggestions on how to recreate
  the look of the printed text on screen?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nRic"

    you can use Georgia, a system font. Georgia used here at typophile for running
    text."

  body: "I find Miller very modern and trendy, although strongly inspired by the Scotch
    model. Better to go with a more literal revival, like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/\">De
    Vinne</a>.\r\n\r\nSee also this <a href=\"http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2007/02/scotch-roman.html\">brilliant
    blog post</a> on the Scotch Roman family of fonts. You may be able to obtain his
    New Scotch font file as well.\r\n\r\nAnother one that would be great if you could
    get it in digital form would be Ronaldson Oldstyle (see <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/19769\">this
    thread</a> for a sample).\r\n\r\nCaslon is another popular and historically authentic
    font family. According to William Berkson, there aren't any good digitizations
    (yet), but the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/caslon-old-face/\">Bitstream</a>
    will serve in a pinch. William, if you're around: any particular reason you dislike
    the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/adobe-caslon/\">Adobe</a>
    version? It seems technically competent to me.\r\n\r\nOh, and for detailed, clear
    instructions on how to compose a Victorian book, as well as an excellent example,
    by <em>all means</em> obtain a copy of The Practice of Typography by Theodore
    Low de Vinne. You can pick up a copy of \"Correct Composition\" for $15 from abebooks,
    a steal, and \"Plain Printing Types\" should be within your budget as well. Composition,
    spacing, and similar details are every bit as important as the choice of the font
    itself.\r\n\r\nBest of luck, and have fun!"

  body: "Thanks for the responses, I'll check out the other threads and have a look
    for the book suggested, might need to search online for it as it'll be hard to
    track down on my tiny island home!\r\n\r\nSorry I didn't make it clear how it'll
    be used on screen. The final book with be done in Flash so no worries about font
    limitations, however I'm going to set the text Illustrator first so I have some
    proper control. I may even rasterize the type so I can add some texture to create
    a more print like feel. It's still early days so exploring my options.\r\n\r\nThank
    you!"

  body: "Caslon may be a \"popular and historically authentic font family,\" but I
    would say it is definitely not appropriate for mimicking a typical Victorian-era
    book. The Caslon revival of the late 1800s was a distinct reaction against the
    typical style of the Victorian era, a turn away from the modern types of the period
    toward an older classic style.\r\n\r\nYou'd be better served sticking with the
    Scotch Modern style as discussed on James Mosley's blog (cited by Raph above).\r\n\r\nFor
    a good digital revival of the Binny & Ronaldson Pica Roman No. 1, you could look
    at Matthew Carter's revision of Monticello (available from Linotype). This is
    an early 1800s American interpretation of the Scotch Modern model and is a bit
    more rugged than some of the original Wilson or Miller models. \r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    version. I may still stick with that face as it was used during that period and
    it should hold up well on screen at smaller sizes. There are plenty of ligatures,
    ornamentals etc too. I'll check out the other suggestions too...\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n "

    NOT a good screen font for small sizes! It will hold up fine under print conditions
    at small sizes if you use the correct optical version, but for screen? No way.\r\n\r\nThe
    x-height is far too short and the serifs too delicate for general web use, let
    alone at small sizes.\r\n"

  body: I agree I'll be losing some detail and quality on screen but Caslon is not
    as delicate as Scotch so might be a better option. Looking at the two side-by-side
    Scotch has some very narrow lines. So whilst Caslon might not be ideal I think
    it's the better of the two. Although there is still the question of how authentic
    it is to the period. I'll check with client, as I don't think it needs to be totally
    accurate, just so long as it creates te correct feel for them. Thanks again for
    the advice.

  body: "kentlew: thanks for the additional background. Of course, Caslon as conscious
    revival would have been towards the end of the Victorian era, but I think it still
    counts. Depends entirely on the context of the material at hand. See <a href=\"https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9611&L=typo-l&P=23971\">this
    TYPO-L thread</a> for more discussion and argument that it should still be considered
    Victorian.\r\n\r\nRobert: Oldstyle No. 7 is a reasonable choice, but the digitization
    is fairly low-fi, and the adaptation from the Bruce revival (to say nothing of
    the Miller & Richards original) to Linotype was also lossy, especially in the
    unitization of widths. It's been degraded 3 times from the original.\r\n\r\nHas
    anybody digitized the \"<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=R4-DjphIpLMC&pg=PA195&lpg=PA195&dq=phelps+dalton+franklin&source=web&ots=syMeLxQIpQ&sig=JrSzQdNgtkV10Mbz1cVXUWYaoF0\">Franklin
    Face</a>\" of Phelps, Dalton & Co. (cut by Phemister)? It's quite pretty, and
    more technically refined than the Oldstyle 7. It's got gorgeous oldstyle figures
    too.\r\n\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> Blumenthal's Art of the Printed Book traces
    the Caslon revival to William Pickering and Charles Wittingham of the Chiswick
    Press in the 1840's, \"which marked a return to the warmer and more agreeable
    types derived from calligraphic sources.\" If that's the vibe the client is going
    for, I think the evidence supports the choice of a nice Caslon revival, including
    Adobe."
