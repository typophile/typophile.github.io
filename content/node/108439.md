  design software.\r\nDoes anyone here recognize this software and how it did work?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bv_5133.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  need to understand what it means the open squares. Does this mean that the shape
  is half of the design? End? Other?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

    That is what I'm trying to discover in order to interpret the shape of the letter...\r\nHere

    I believe the CRT photo-imaging process was strictly binary, so I don\u2019t know
    what the open squares could have meant."

    from middle 80's\r\n2- this maybe was converted to Lasercomp format fonts (?)

    typeface was drawn at Lausanne (Swiss), on Autologic, Inc.\r\nFrom my knowledge
    this company is already closed, but anyone here can point some more info about
    it or the software?\r\nThanks all for the help...\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

    David Lemon, Paul Hunt and Miguel Sousa. For De Does you could go though TEFF*
