  I am looking for feedback on the mark, and a direction for the type specifically.\r\n\r\nSwell
  Houses is a product. Custom desiged houses, finessed and finished to a demanding
  level of detail for a young sophisticated market. The brand should reflect the coastal
  desires of the australian buyer and be contemporary and sophisticated.\r\n\r\n\"hot
  modernism\" is a term the client likes...\r\n\r\nAn online sales channel will function
  as a brochure for the company, feeding clients into what will eventually be a very
  personalised service. Swell is a gateway to all the services required for building
  your own home. All manages by swell.\r\n\r\nI hope the above swathe of marketing
  type dross gives you an idea of the product...\r\n\r\nThe may be other brands like
  \"swell architects\", and swell \"shacks\" a suite of swell silos....\r\n\r\njr

  body: of the options shown, i prefer the options set in all caps. I believe those
    options best reinforce the geometric nature of the mark. lets see some more typefaces
    and combinations.

    is what they want, then I'd focus on that aeasthetic more. The 3-d sphere doesn't
    say hot modernism to me.\r\n\r\nPlay off of some patterns from the era:\r\n\r\nhttp://ec3.images-amazon.com/images/P/0811833402.01._SS500_SCLZZZZZZZ_V1056495126_.jpg\r\nhttp://eamesdemetrios.com/images/maharam.jpg\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    focus on the 'swell' aspect with a slightly cheesy angle.\r\n"

  body: Hi guys... Even though this company will be australian, and despite its american
    colloquial name... I dont want to compete with a supermarket... Is that what safeway
    is?... Anyway... A slight shift on the mark for your thoughts... stronger image,
    less reliance on a 'letter form'[img:sites/default/files/old-images/swell_layout_prelim_03_4798.gif]

  body: "Ditch the Trajan, I would guess that the marketing-speak gurus don't equate
    hot-modernism with the modernism of the 20th century and that your first post
    was probably more what they were looking for. Rather than Safeway (which did have
    a presence in UK until recently) I saw a development of the yin and yang symbol
    combined with the S, which I feel is also along the lines that your client requests
    on the other hand you are right to avoid any conflict. I'm afraid that your later
    iterations seem more generic and are less convincing. I would work on producing
    a mark with the word swell and then a division, so that the division is in a position
    where it won't cause the mark and swell to alter their relationship, for example
    in your first post the second image with the word centred under the mark and the
    division hangs off that.\r\nbtw when faced with swell I didn't think of any US
    connotation, more of sea swell.\r\nTim"

    ;)\r\n\r\nI agree, lose the Trajan. Your first type treatments were much more
    appealing. Also, the first thing I thought of when I saw the mark on your last
    version was a pet carrier. An empty, floating pet carrier. All that's missing
    is a handle."
