  this forum, and you guys are really good at this, so I thought I'd post this\r\npiece
  to see if you can help me with some feedback.\r\n\r\nThis is a logo for a singer,
  the name is in swedish - vocal studio. Her wishes were; simple, formal, readable,
  fairly minimalistic without frills. I took inspiration from geometric sans fonts
  like avenir, century gothic and futura, and fitted a coloured whole note into it.
  \r\n\r\nAny thoughts on the letters, color and overall impression?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vokalstudion

  body: The letters look wobbly and inconsistent. You might want to use an actual
    font (and only one!).

  body: "I'm interested in what makes it look inconsistent though, if you can pin
    it down that would be helpful. \r\nI mentioned the other fonts because I tried
    to learn from them how to tackle specific problems, for instance using the 'a'
    glyph in an otherwise geometric font, which characters use thinning towards the
    stem etc. I did try the logo in different existing fonts, but we didn't find what
    we were after all in one place. \r\n\r\nI could use some help if you could say
    something specific about the letters. I think there's an inconsistency between
    the fairly bulky a and the thin s, but how to handle it without making a very
    wide 's' glyph... I'll try some variants. "

  body: "Hej Zoran,\r\n\r\nI'm not vaguely a professional, but I think I can give
    you a start? (Although this would all be much easier if you just went in and modded
    Century Gothic or something. ;))\r\n\r\nOne key thing is to try to look at things
    based on how they appear optically, rather than going by metrics. You've definitely
    been trying to do this, but the thickness of the various letters are all over
    the place. The arms of the k look thicker than the stem, the D looks thicker on
    the curved part... S as you say looks consistently thinner than the other characters,
    with it's lower terminal thick-looking. k's upper arm loooks longer than the lower
    arm, t crossbar too thin, o needs to have overhang to work. u is too wide. And
    I think you need to work over a lot of curves there that seem \"wobbly\", connect
    slightly off, vary unintentionally in curvature with respect of the other side
    etc...\r\n\r\nRead something like this: http://66.147.242.192/~operinan/2/2.3.2a/2.3.2.06.illusion.htm\r\n\r\nLycka
    till!"

  body: "That gives me many things to move forward on. Also, the link is very useful.
    \r\nI have been doing graphics for some time, but in other domains. I find it
    more difficult to keep a fresh eye when working with types and letters than imagery,
    for me it's a lot more vague feelings and less ability to pin things down. Off
    to do some reading then. \r\n\r\nTack Birdseeder!\r\n \r\n"

  body: "I would just go with Avenir or maybe Gotham. If there's just one letter you
    don't like, such as the one-storey {a} in Futura, many professional fonts will
    have a stylistic alternate (a two-storey {a}) available.\r\n\r\nYou seem to be
    looking for a compact wordmark with short ascenders. That should be possible with
    any of the above-mentioned fonts, which have straight ascenders... just crop them
    a bit short if they're too long for you.\r\n\r\nAs for the wobbliness in your
    hand-made mark, I agree with what Birdseeding said. Also, the stress in the {v}
    is the wrong way round; the downstroke should be thicker than the upstroke."
