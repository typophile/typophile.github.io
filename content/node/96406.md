body: Wondering if anyone can place this type used on a ceramic or possibly metal
  tile from Italy? The text says Italian Fratelli Andreoni Azienda Agricola Roma  which
  translates as Andreoni Brothers Agricultural Company Rome.  The way the x-height
  bars cross the verticals on the A and E is very distinctive, but I can't figure
  it out myself so any help is very much appreciated.

    ago on a cd cover, see this link: [[http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7825/2308/400/Front_coveronly.jpg]]\r\n\r\n
    but I no longer have the font on my computer and can't remember figure out what
    it was. Its wider and the A sides are different, but the bars crossing the verticals
    is similar so maybe they are related somehow."

  body: "Yugyug, that font you used 100 years ago would seem to be Insignia\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/INSIG_6257.png]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/insignia/fonts/\r\n\r\nAs
    for the Italian metalwork: it's easy to find Art-Deco-inspired fonts that have
    SOME of those characteristics, but I don't know about finding a single font that
    has them all.\r\n\r\nCasablanca has the through lines and the round O, but not
    the distinctive R\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/casablanca-rr/\r\n\r\nMark
    Simonson's beautiful Mostra Nuova would be good for setting the word \"ROMA\"
    at the bottom of your photo. Mostra even has the triangular crossbar.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra-nuova/\r\n\r\nAn
    example of a font with some Art Deco characteristics:\r\nCopasetic\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cheapprofonts/copasetic-nf-pro/\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you want to spend a few hours poring over a thousand other fonts like that,
    a search on myfonts.com for \"Deco,\" \"moderne\" and \"geometric\" turns up a
    TON of possibilities (though I wouldn't expect any exact matches)...\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/deco+moderne+geometric/fonts/"
