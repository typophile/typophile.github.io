body: "Hi, everybody. A few weeks ago I started working on this new typeface, inspired
  by the <strong>H</strong> in an album cover designed by Non-Format (see the first
  image I've posted here, <strong>barrio_inspiration</strong>). \r\n\r\nMy font started
  out with open counters, which soon became slits. At that point, a friend of mine
  saw it (<strong>barrio_sample_02</strong>) and said, \"You ought to call it Barrio!\"
  I liked the name. Then I tried elongating the slits, thinking that they would make
  the characters easier to read, but another friend says the opposite has happened
  (<strong>barrio_sample_03</strong>). I can see that the long horizontal openings
  in <strong>s</strong> and <strong>c</strong>, for example, are not helping.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think? And do you have any other comments? I've added some sketches, so that
  you can see some of my process.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nRicardo\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/00_barrio_inspiration_4787.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_barrio_sketch_01_3724.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/02_barrio_sketch_02_4402.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/03_barrio_letters_01_5546.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/04_barrio_sample_01_6648.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/05_barrio_sketch_03_4498.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/06_barrio_sample_02_4471.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/07_barrio_sketch_04_5158.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/08_barrio_sample_03_4595.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/09_barrio_sketch_05_6272.gif]\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Yes the pentrations on the s should be shorter. How do you think this will
    be used? Tell us why you are making it. That will help a lot when it comes to
    advice. With any font it''s not about being ''better'' in some general way - it''s
    about achieving something specific. Ideally there would be a well thought out
    use that you have in mind. When a face like this shows up on Typophile it kinda
    tough to know what to say because the style is not in fashion right now. And because
    there are alot of typefaces which are similar. I was told the same thing more
    or less with my first typeface. But they had a point. You may well have the seed
    of something. But the way to get it to grow is to ask these questions: What''s
    it for? Who would use it? Why would they pick it over other fonts like it? You
    can get there but this was just the 1st step. Keep going.'

  body: "The shorter slits are indeed better, but you might want to consider making
    them a bit wider for smaller uses. I like this kind of type, it's like \"Baby
    Teeth: the next generation\" ;-)\r\nLove the sketches as well, it's always nice
    to see how things evolve."

  body: The letters with red shading seem the most novel to me what if you went that
    way? What about leaving the hand drawn feeling in?

  body: "Thanks for your input, guys! I have some other, older font projects that
    are in various states of incompletion,  :-D  but this is the first one I've posted
    here to be critiqued.\r\n\r\nIll Sans, thanks for your flattering comparison.
    I think that <strong><a href=\"http://www.neubauberlin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Neubau</a></strong>
    and <strong><a href=\"http://www.non-format.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Non-Format</a></strong>
    have done a lot of great work in that regard already.\r\n\r\nAnd Eben, I think
    that the drawing with the red shading is a whole different font. I like the idea
    of leaving the hand-drawn feeling in. And Ill, I agree that the slits should be
    wider for smaller sizes, although this typeface is meant for display, after all.
    \ ;-)\r\n\r\nI'll try to post some more later on in the week, if I ever get a
    chance to sit down and draw some more, that is! It's end-of-year madness time
    at work."

    It would be nice to make a scribbly version of the font as well."
