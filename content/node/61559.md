body: "Hi,\r\nI'm in the beginning stages of creating a logo and\r\nsearching for
  the right direction.\r\nI am creating a logo for a music festival.\r\nThis is an
  identity project for class. \r\n\r\nA little information about the festival:\r\nPresque
  Isle Music Festival is a three-day nationally \r\nacclaimed music festival featuring
  some of today\u2019s most \r\ninfluential artists. The headlining bands are Wilco,
  Justice \r\nand Grizzly Bear. The festival has sites at Presque Isle, Little \r\nPresque
  Isle and Tourist Park with the main focus based at \r\nPresque Isle. There will
  be a performing stage at each site. \r\nAn extensive map directs ticketholders to
  their desired location, \r\nexplaining modes of transportation and displaying all
  of the \r\nartist and local businesses tents. Television commercials and \r\nradio
  commercials are used to help promote and advertise the\r\n event. There is also
  a website about the event, history of the \r\nlocations, proceeds, and the artists.
  The festival will be working \r\nin tandem with local businesses and artists. There
  will be a \r\ndesignated area for local business and artists to place a tent \r\nor
  vending stand. All proceeds will be used to aid the DNR in \r\ntheir ongoing endeavor
  to preserve and maintain the \r\nEscanaba River State Forrest. \r\n\r\nI believe
  I am changing the name to Presque Isle Music Festival. \r\nAll critique and constructive
  criticism is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nOh, the logo is supposed to be a topographic
  map of the island where the music festival is held. \r\nI don't know whether or
  not people will be able to understand that. It is helvetica right now, only \r\nbecause
  I am on my laptop right now and need to get font folio from my work computer.\r\nToday
  I am experimenting with a more youthful logo using paint, construction paper and
  grid paper. \r\nI am about to attempt some hand illustrated type, but any suggestions
  on typefaces would be awesome. \r\n\r\nThank You!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   "

  body: "I'm liking the direction of the first three sketches. Some thoughts:\r\n\r\n-Why
    is it \"Dead River music festival\"? Did you mean to say \"<cite>I believe I am
    changing the name to Dead River Music Festival.</cite>\" instead?\r\n-Is the \"700\"
    from the first few sketches an important number? If not, that is a prime opportunity
    to incorporate the year (2010). I would also make it stand out more with a different
    color option.\r\n-The transparency effect leaves room for further exploration.
    Perhaps your idea of a layered construction paper look could work? (There is a
    better way to execute this idea I think.)\r\n\r\npenn\r\n\r\np.s. Was the \".\"
    post an intentional bump? If so, don't do it anymore :) New posts are well flagged
    and will always receive the attention they deserve."

  body: "Thanks for the input Penn! \r\n\r\n\"Dead River\" Music Festival was the
    original name intended \r\nfor the music festival, but since the combination of
    the name\r\n and topographic map are so ambiguous I figured I would \r\ngo with
    a more straightforward approach and call this festival\r\n\"Presque Isle Music
    Festival.\"\r\n\r\nChanging the number from 700 to 2010 is a great idea.\r\nYeah,
    I plan on way more exploration with the current\r\nconcept I am working with.
    Tonight I will be working \r\nwith more tactile media. \r\n\r\nOh the \".\" was
    not a bump.. i don't know what that means, but \r\nit was an accident I went to
    add on to the original post. I didn't \r\nknow that you could \"edit\" the original
    post and when I went \r\nback I couldn't figure out how to delete the post. So
    I just \r\nput a period. \r\n\r\nAgain, Thanks for your help Penn. \r\n\r\nI appreciate
    it! "

  body: "I really like the concept of the toporaphic map of the isle.\r\nIn terms
    of type graphic relationship i am leaning to no.1 but that will probably have
    to be alterered depending on point of application.\r\nYou may want to look at
    making the shapes formed by the contour lines a bit simpler and a bit stronger
    to give the whole thing a grater visual presence.\r\nOn the name front, although
    the \"presque isle music festival\" is a lot more descriptive of the location
    which in turn helps to understand the logo it is simply not as evocative as \"dead
    river\" which sounds like a really cool festival location.\r\nReplacing the peak
    height of the island with 2010 may have the problem of people reading it as the
    peak height, not a small hill by any stretch and a posible turn off for potential
    visitors. In my opinion you would be better off droping the peak height and having
    the year in a completely diferent location on the logo.\r\n\r\nWill"
