		<div class="commentbody">A few students from Offenbach and I have formed a type collective, and we are putting together a website (I'll post the URL after it launches in a week and a half). <BR> <BR>We want to open our platform up to other interested students at our school as well. Last week, we began to think about what we wanted to be as a group, what we stood for, etc&hellip; This way, it would be easy for us to figure out which other students/work would be a good fit for us and our collective's site. <BR> <BR>Several of us have worked &quot;in the nearby type industry.&quot; We all have strong feelings about type design, and plan to continue focusing our studies/lives/etc. toward that. Anyway, here are our general guidelines for type that can be displayed on the site: <BR> <BR>1. the work may not be derivative <BR>2. the work may not be available anyhere as a free font at the moment <BR>3. the work should be &quot;good&quot; enough. By good enough, we mean, that we as a group should all be able to sit and talk about it. Of course, none of us are professional type designers, so &quot;good&quot; is still relative. But we have to set the bar for ourselves somewhere. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, there are students at our school who make typeface design experiments that are derivative. As a group, we are all in agreement that derivative work is bad, and that we should not support it. <BR> <BR>While we all agree that we don't want to create a free font site, I'm not so sure that we are all in agreement about the distribution of free fonts in general. I tend to agree with Nick, and think that free fonts hurt the industry and individual designers, perid. I would not like to support this practive with my time, money, and creative efforts. <BR> <BR>I just wanted to see what the general opinion is. I don't want to seem like a reactionary; if I'm out of line, we might re-consider our free font position.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I should add that although I don't think giving away fonts for free is immoral, I do think it tends to devalue type, and is usually bad for the type industry and those who wish to make their living at type. <BR> <BR>So, if the question is, should we give away some fonts, given that we don't care whether we make money, I'd say &quot;that depends.&quot; Personally, I'd suggest you decide what you think the fonts are worth, and charge that amount for them. They might be quite cheap. I guess the problem with that is that getting into the whole e-commerce setup might be expensive and troublesome, given that you don't expect to charge much. I wonder what one would do for sort of &quot;poor man's e-commerce&quot;? Maybe let people pay with PayPal, and email them their fonts afterwards? Say, you could auction the fonts on e*Bay! Okay, now I'm getting silly&hellip;. <BR> <BR>Seriously, though, one element of the problem is that most users don't understand the quality difference between most of the free and shareware fonts and high quality well crafted fonts. So as long as there are lots of free fonts, they think people are &quot;greedy&quot; or something if they want to charge for fonts. <BR> <BR>What I do think is unethical is making knockoffs of existing retail fonts (whether free or not), or distributing other people's retail fonts illegally (piracy). <BR> <BR>My two cents. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Distributing free fonts (with the designer's permission) hardly seems immoral to me. <BR> <BR>I understand the argument that it may devalue the work of type designers in general, but I'd present <a href="http://www.yale.edu/printer/typeface/typeface.html">the Yale typeface</a> as a good counter example. Granted, it's not free to <i>all</i>, but it is free to students and faculty. It's an example, in my opinion, of an organization absorbing the cost for the general betterment of their typographic environment. This strikes me as a moral act, or at the very least an act that isn't immoral. Proper credit and emphasis are also given to the designer and the intentions associated with the font family's designs, which contributes to my support for this project. <BR> <BR>Personally, if taking things that're free means I'm greedy, then I was greedy by reading Typophile before contributing, where I got insights, opinions, and help for free. I also offered them up without the promise of reciprocation from any individual I helped (and still do). Distribution of free fonts (or software, for that matter) can be done in the name of public good and open exchange of ideas, which has little to do with commerce and a lot to do with growth and community. <BR> <BR>I buy fonts, but I also download and appreciate generous free offerings such as Unibody and Silkscreen. I don't think honest, well-intended distribution of personal work is the problem. The gauging of type's value by the public at large is influenced much more thoroughly by Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe than by John Doe's Personal Font Site with his free <i>Star Wars</i> font knockoffs. <BR> <BR>Note: I do not condone font piracy, and my argument does not apply to those who publicly redistribute fonts outside of the terms of their licenses, or seek to make money from the designs of others.</div>

Carter did, and they paid him for it (I presume). I fail to see the problem. The type is forced on no one, and exists as its own reason for being, not as a bullet point in a product sell sheet. I take it that the manner of its distribution is the problem? They aren't distributing it against Carter's wishes, are they? I'm also not sure what you're referring to when you write about &quot;an abuse of taxpayers hard earned money,&quot; could you elaborate? I get the sense I'm not aware of the full picture.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good point in the previous post Chris. To add onto your argument that distributing free font does not neccessarily devalues the work of type designers in general, take a look at Gaultney's Gentium too: <BR><a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=Gentium" target="_blank"><a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;amp;item_id=Gentium">http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;amp;item_id=Gentium</a></a> <BR> <BR>I'm also intrigued by the idea of open source type, James. Although in many ways, type seems like much more difficult area for open source development than software for example. <BR> <BR>Some free fonts can be &quot;WMD&quot; Gerald, but also type business can never be what it used to be before. And it souldn't. Technology changes every aspect of life, so it should change type business as well. Just like software, additional fonts can be manufactured with zero marginal cost now: <BR> <BR><a href="http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/general/intellectual/coffee.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/general/intellectual/coffee.htm">http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/general/intellectual/coffee.htm</a></a> <BR><a href="http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/papers/ip.ch.1.m1004.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/papers/ip.ch.1.m1004.pdf">http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/papers/ip.ch.1.m1004.pdf</a></a>   (pdf) <BR> <BR>and I do think that most EULAs are too restrictive. Note that I feel very strongly against any kind of piracy too. <BR> <BR>Sooo sorry if I'm straying off topic</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is why the public really should be educated more about type somehow. <BR>If an artist comes into a community and tries to give away free badly done paintings, people probably won't take them. I think that's because people have more opinions about painting.. Type is a field focused on very small differences (compared to painting, sculpture, etc. where differences are more readily noticed) It takes more time and patience to understand type, whereas someone can look at a painting and right away tell you if they like it or not. Even at young ages, all children have favorite colors, but once they learn to read, do they have favorite typefaces? Would they, if someone taught them earlier? I really think they would, but perhaps I'm just being hopeful.. <BR>Anyhow, educating people somehow about type is the fastest way to ending free-font webpages.  <BR> <BR>So then, would it be ok to teach them for free? <BR> <BR>We want people to appreciate good design, but how much are you willing to give away? Should people keep their good advice to themselves? Hopefully not! <BR> <BR>The bigger problem is that most people don't want to take the time to know. Design is something we feel like we have to do. Its an option for the general public, and then the only thing that matters is if it matches the bedspread. I'm exaggerating.. I really do think though if it were explained to them in an interesting way, and not at 20,000+ a year, then more type would sell, and the need for good design might be more appreciated. <BR></div>

As a child I loved to read and I loved to read books that had a certain type in them.  I never learned the names of the type I liked, but I did recognize that certain types made the reading experience better, the way good paper did. <BR> <BR>Now I'm working in a specialized web design field and I need to build a type library.  I have purchased a lot of type recently but I have also downloaded free type. When I found type that was obviously ripped off or downright stolen, I realized that I didn't have the knowledge to recognize which free fonts were original and which weren't.  So I went back and deleted the free fonts, except for a very few that I feel certain about.  <BR> <BR>I see nothing wrong with someone offering a free font if you purchase a font.  But I think that we should respect the artists who design type and pay them what they deserve or we will find that we are left with a lot of cheap, crappy type and not much else.   <BR>  <BR></div>

Likewise on font distribution, surely?  <BR> <BR>I dont think that too many people would hold with the argument that ALL music HAD to be charged for (or not released or performed), so that those who are at the top of their profession should not feel somehow devalued, and I dont see why that analogy isn't fitting here. <BR> <BR>Type design isn't all about the money. Some people are designing fonts simply because they enjoy it and may want to share it with others. Others are learning (this is where I am at). Others to provide an altruistic service to the wider community. And many people are trying to make their living from it.  <BR> <BR>All are surely acceptable, if not welcome?</div>

Instead, we want to educate our own fellow students first. There are 700 students who study with us, most of whom have no idea about type. Many of them probably just assume that it is automatically generated by the computer itself! <BR> <BR>We want to to show them what is interesting about type design, why some students at the school do it, and why stealing fonts is bad (everyone knows that students steal typefaces).

Governents are more likely to legislate against anti-social behavior when there is a clear victim. <BR> <BR>It's one thing to say that the government has no business telling people how to behave when their behavior only effects themselves, quite another to use this as an argument to excuse activity which harms others. <BR> <BR>Of course, there are grey areas, such as &quot;is a foetus a person&quot; (sorry if the example offends, but I am not raising this as a partisan issue).

		<div class="commentbody">Brian, to be honest, I was a little surprised they could pay attention to my lecture. I got them in front of a white board and drew a few Bodoni letters and a few Garamond-ish forms to discuss stroke axis. Then I told them that this comes from the cant of a chisel-tip pen, and historical movements, etc. I followed with a few points about stroke contrast. Then, I pointed out x-height and character width. I used this to demonstrate the far more subtle differences between Times and Garamond, now that they understood the terms. Then I said, imagine the number of characters on a single page in a book. Now multiply that by the number of pages. Now you see why such little differences are so important, etc., etc. <BR> <BR>With some dry-erase markers and about 10 minutes, I was able to communicate most of that info. However, I also had a willing and intelligent audience of one. <BR> <BR>I also got into kerning and kerning pairs, how many characters are actually in a font, and how many weights a truly versatile text font requires (emphasizing that the bold is not just a computer extrapolation, but an actual unique design, etc.). But that was more aimed at demonstrating why font families can cost 100s of dollars when you get them packaged with software that costs about as much as one font. That was probably an additional 10 minutes or so.</div>

Altsys didn't get it for free, they had to figure it out. <BR> <BR>And I didn't get the format for free (which would have been useless to me anyway, as I am not a programmer), I paid Altsys for their work in building a font making tool.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Moral judgement differs between each case.</p>
<p>If using a font has a direct economic influence on others, then I see no argument to favour not paying for it. For example, if a non-profit organisation uses a font to attract customers away from another organisation, then that non-profit organisation is morally obligated to pay for the font.</p>
<p>In contrast, if you are using a font for academic or private viewings that have no discernible economic influence on others, then you may have moral basis for free use. Many companies have a fair rights policy, or personal discretion, that allows for this.</p>
<p>This is my scheme of things. If I am distributing fonts or anything else, my moral obligation is to ensure the receiving party shares my point of view.</p>

<p>Nick, this is off topic but have you tried setting long passages of text with any of your Panoptica typefaces? How does the panoptic alphabet hold us as text type?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read studies about reading the shapes of words rather than the individual letters and the panoptic alphabet seems like an interesting way of testing that idea beyond upper or lowercase body copy.</p>
