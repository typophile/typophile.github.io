body: 'SOLUS <BR> <BR>In 2003, whilst researching the life and work of Eric Gill,
  I came across several references to a typeface called &#39;Solus&#39; cut in 1929.  <BR>
  <BR>My curiosity was kindled when I experienced difficulty in finding an illustration
  of Solus in print or on the internet, and I discovered that the typeface had been
  withdrawn by Monotype in 1967.  <BR> <BR>A few meagre visual snippets failed to
  satisfy and in July 2004 I posted an internet request on the Typophile Forum. To
  my excitement Alessandro Segalini put up a copy of the Solus typeface from a specimen
  book, and although it was rather poorly printed at a small point size, I made a
  &#39;Solus Rough&#39; font to get a feel for the typeface. <BR> <BR>I liked result
  and decided to research further, to seek out clearer source material and attempt
  the first digital version of Solus. I contacted Agfa Monotype by letter and email
  but got no reply. <BR> <BR>I also made contact with some of the professionals suggested
  by Alessandro Segalini. Petra Cerne Oven asked Christopher Burke who felt that Solus
  was superseded by Joanna.  James Mosley agreed, but still felt the resurrection
  of Solus to be an interesting project. <BR> <BR>I started to compare Solus with
  Joanna and found it to be more similar to Perpetua in many respects. I also  still
  felt it to have an identity of its own, for me it has a real English schooldays
  feel. <BR> <BR>Justin Howes of the Type Museum noted, &#34;I&#39;ve always liked
  Solus, and it would be good to see it revived&#34;. <BR> <BR>Mailartist and printer
  Alan Brignull sent me a high resolution copy of some Solus characters printed at
  48 pt. and I set to work on making a version that was as close to Gill&#39;s original
  as I could create. <BR> <BR>A big problem was the actual shape of the slab serifs.  Even
  at 48 pt. the serifs appear to have slight curved bracketing. I acknowledge that
  this may well be an error - James Mosley wrote &#34;My impression is that your bracketing,
  however sutble, is wrong, because Solus is conceived as essentially a mechanistic
  type -- a &#39;light Egyptian&#39;.&#34; <BR> <BR>Even so, I have decided to allow
  myself to be guided by my observations. Some Egyptians do possess curved brackets,
  moreover Solus has a warmth compared to Joanna that is augmented by the subtle bracketing
  visible on the printed copy. <BR> <BR>In September, I contacted Robin Nicholas,
  Head of Typography at Agfa Monotype, and although he didn&#39;t invite me round
  for a coffee and a detailed look at Gill&#39;s original drawings, he did recommend
  Gill&#39;s 1926 sketchbook,  &#39;A Book of Alphabets for Douglas Cleverdon&#39;,
  as showing the origin of Solus, and I immediately ordered a copy from Amazon. <BR>
  <BR>He also noted, &#34; I understand that there may be a legal problem using the
  name '

  body: Sorry, Steve - broken link fixed!  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not very good at the name
    game. As K-Type&#39;s Anna was designed for my daughter I didn&#39;t have much
    alternative, I just assumed ITC Anna was trademarked &#39;ITC Anna&#39; - I&#39;ll
    await the lawsuit! <BR> <BR>My overly scant research was also picked up on by
    Vincent Connare when I made Lexia Readable, based on the legible shapes and spacing
    of Comic Sans but removing the kids comic book style. Vincent noted that Dalton
    Maag already had a Lexia and suggested &#39;Our Kid&#39;. I proposed &#39;Comic
    Sons&#39;. I&#39;m expecting the summons any day now. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m hoping
    that major players such as ITC and Dalton Maag are busy enough and won&#39;t feel
    threatened by a little foundry accidentally treading on big toes. Anyway, isn&#39;t
    the duplicate naming of fonts something of a typographic tradition? Probably not,
    eh?

  body: Thanks for those wise words of wisdom, Dan. I&#39;ll email Robin Nicholas
    and see if the license idea will float. The original aim was to bring Solus back
    from the dead, and Monotype is this baby&#39;s home.

    material they might have related to Solus. They have a lot of Gill material, including
    original drawings for some types and lettering.

  body: Hello John, I did contact the St Bride librarians. They were very nice and
    tried to find stuff, but couldn&#39;t come up with any visual material on Solus.
    I think it really has been overlooked and regarded almost as Gill&#39;s failure
    from the outset - and I couldn&#39;t disagree more!
