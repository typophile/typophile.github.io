  HTFGotham but follows the buildup of the neon sign used in the attatched Chicago
  movie poster. In other words an outline font. "

    add a judicious stroke.

    How come you can\u2019t use Illustrator\u2019s outer glow? Just make sure your
    bitmap effects settings have a proper dpi."

    body: I'm not looking for a glow. I am merely interested in the structure of the
      framework (sort of like a neon sign without the neon in it. In other words a
      traditional b&w font that follows the line of a neonsign. I know I've seen it
      but unsure where. It was drawn by a professional typedesigner and had the feeling
      of a grotesque light meets black font.

    body: 'Prisma is at least a step in the right direction however I was hoping to
      find a font that was more monowidth if you understand (reffering esp. to the
      S which is to narrow). Also I was hoping the lines would follow around a corner
      and go back up (connect in a neonlike loop) '
