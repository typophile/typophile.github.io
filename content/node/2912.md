  body: Could very well be, if not for the fact that the outside  <BR>curves on &#34;C&#34;
    and &#34;O&#34; are identical in the Nissan face,  <BR>but quite different in
    the above sample &#40;curved on the  <BR>&#34;C&#34;, almost flat on the &#34;O&#34;&#41;.

    identification, or do you need an exact match?
