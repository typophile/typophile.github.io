  attempting to bring some typefaces of mine with me to my \r\n\r\ndesign internship;\r\n\r\ni
  use FONTAGENTPRO for font management . and the office uses EXTENSIS.\r\n\r\ni brought
  up a list of fonts i wanted to bring with me . then i clicked on SHOW IN FINDER.\r\n\r\nI
  took those files to the office.\r\n\r\ni then wen about trying to install them in
  EXTENSIS. . .\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nthose files were not recognized at all by EXTENSIS
  .\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nthe same thing happened in reverse and the fonts\r\n\r\ntaken
  from EXTENSIS were not recognized by FONTAGENT .\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nFROM WHAT I'VE
  READ . the LWFN formats or TTFIL are un-installable .\r\n\r\nthey need to be TTF
  or OPENTYPE or ADOBE.\r\n\r\nI TRIED adding the TTF FILE EXTENSION to the files
  . THAT DID NOT WORK .\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nDO I NEED TO USE A FONT TRANSLATION APP ?
  ? ? \r\n\r\nHOW CAN I SHARE MY FONT FILES ? ? ?\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nLex"

  body: "HELLO AEROSYN-LEX MESTROVIC.\r\n\r\nExtensis Suitcase does work with all
    fonts supported under Mac OS X. Your problem most likely is that you are transfering
    the font files in a way that strips off the old Mac \"resource fork\" data. Type
    1 Postscript and traditional TrueType fonts for Mac OS have hidden data and cannot
    be sent as email attachements, ftp or on DOS formatted volumes with out being
    made into a .zip or .sit archive. \r\n\r\nIf you have Mac OS 10.3 or 10.4 find
    the folder containing the fonts. Control-click on the folder and choose Create
    Archive. This will make a .zip file of the fonts. You can safely transfer this
    file to another system and then unzip it.  \r\n\r\nSo called \"Windows\" TrueType
    and OpenType files have a .ttf or .otf extension. These can be moved from system
    to system without being zipped. \r\n\r\nThe FFIL is often referred to a \"font
    suitcase\". This could either be a traditional Mac TrueType font or a suitcase
    associated with a Mac Type 1 Postscript outline. The LWFN is a Postscript Type
    1 Outline, sometimes referred to as a \"printer font\". Some of this is confusing
    because these formats have been in use since the 1980s!"

      for me. MANY MANY THANKS .\r\n\r\nI had read various Font Format FAQ's but none

      the method now;\r\n\r\nhere's to hoping it works out.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nthanks
