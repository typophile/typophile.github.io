  faces have never been my forte, and I am not particularly satisfied with any of
  Adobe's prepackaged solutions for body copy, available with the InDesign suite.
  I am particularly fond of Poppl Laudatio, because of its narrow stance, large x-height,
  and subtle serif treatment, but am\u2014for reasons which many may know\u2014disinclined
  to do business with Berthold in any way, shape or form.\r\n\r\nIs there a free or

  of electronic formats?"

    your suit among Goodgle fonts : http://fadebiaye.tumblr.com/post/20343762067/goodgle-fonts-google-fonts-curated
    or Velvetyne : http://www.velvetyne.fr.\r\n\r\nBTW, are your fonts ePub-friendly?
    I read your EULA but your licensing is still a bit unclear about that. For the
    record, your Jeanneret is one of my favourite : http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/jeanneret-nf/

  body: "Frank,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recommendations: I will check them out.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as my fonts being ePub friendly: they ought to be, but getting competitive
    pricing information is difficult if not impossible, thanks to the stranglehold
    that a certain monopoly player has on the market. Not that it really matters anymore:
    after months of trying to rescue my marriage in the light of my wife's chronic
    alcoholism and subsequent Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Syndrome, I have finally given
    up. Since my entire professional library was developed while we were marriage,
    by law my wife owns half of all of my Intellectual Property, and she would like
    to liquidate same. Unfortunately, no one will make a reasonable\u2014or, for that
    matter, an unreasonable\u2014offer for the entire collection of over one thousand
    workmanlike fonts.\r\n\r\nP.S. Quattrocento is a wonderful family; I will investigate
    it thoroughly."

    are you sure your wife owns 50% of your IP? I find that hard to believe, as your

    somewhat surprised that Nick Shinn didn't mention his Beaufort typeface. The Regular
    and Italic would suit my purposes well, and at less than $80 for the pair. OTOH,

    how that works, ain't it?\r\n\r\nBTW, are you interested\u2014or do you know someone
    who might be\u2014in developing a plug-in for websites which specialize in producing
