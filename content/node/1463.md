  I&#39;d have given the font name!! <BR> <BR>If ANYONE has a copy of Charlotte Sans
  Book and would be kind enough to set the text: NETWORKING SOLUTIONS LTD and then
  create outline and mail it to me, I&#39;d be much obliged. <BR> <BR>Thanking you,

  <BR> <BR>I copied this post from MyFonts. Its pretty bold to ask someone to create
  artwork from a font they don&#39;t have and have it sent to them. Its a twist on
  &#34;can you send a font to me for free&#34;. I included the email address because
  this guy needs to know its soooo wrong. Any thoughts, Dan'

  body: 'Sorry for a late reply, guys, but I had my reasons. I&#39;m no goddamn weasel.
    <BR> <BR>I never <i>wanted</i> to have a long-winded discussion about all this
    shite because the absurdity in that only makes me more disappointed in you. The
    absurdity is in the fact that it would take you five minutes to help a stranger
    who politely asked for help if you <i>were</i> able to provide him with the outline,
    but instead you choose to use your &#34;valuable&#34; time on talking out of your
    asses. This is what prompted me to write the original comment in the first place,
    so absurdity laughs me in the face when I see you continuing being totally clueless.
    <BR> <BR>I do mind answering a few questions for two reasons. First of all, no
    one answered, or even tried to answer <i>my</i> question, so I don&#39;t feel
    like answering yours. Second, I&#39;ve heard &#34;What do you do for a living?&#34;
    argument a hundred thousand times before and you don&#39;t have to waste your
    time convincing me that the world revolves around money -- I know that already,
    and I do need money to eat and be able to talk to you. <BR> <BR>By asking me about
    what I do for a living, you are only proving my point. You think about money and
    even want to talk to me about money. Well then, why the f&uuml;ck don&#39;t you
    just say it? I mean, if you see nothing wrong with measuring everything with money,
    why don&#39;t you just stay cool and answer my question like this: No, I can&#39;t
    think in terms of anything other than money. Than we would agree and no one would
    get hurt. How about that, eh? <BR> <BR>If you want to talk about money, go talk
    to Meredith -- she seems to be more than willing to put words into my mouth. If
    you ask me more question, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be glad to answer them for me.
    <BR> <BR>You don&#39;t have to call me mister to pretend to be polite when you
    aren&#39;t. I don&#39;t have the courtesy, but neither do you, so let&#39;s just
    cut the crap, shell we? I&#39;m not insulting you on purpose, but you <i>are</i>
    being insulted by my honest opinion about you. You can change that opinion, if
    you wish to, or care -- it&#39;s mostly up to you. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t &#34;barge&#34;
    in here. What is this, some kind of small, snobbish, private cocktail party? Am
    I supposed to crawl or squeeze in here? This is a public forum were I chose to
    voice my goddamn honest opinion. If moderators feel like it, they are welcome
    to ban me from here. And by the way, if you weren&#39;t all singing to the same
    stupid tune, I probably wouldn&#39;t have my voiced opinion the way I did. Do
    you realise how cliquish you all sound? <BR> <BR>My whole point, if you still
    haven&#39;t realised it, is that you should be nice to people around you when
    you can, when it doesn&#39;t really cost you anything. When was the last time
    you helped a old man on the street to carry a slightly heavy bag? I can argue
    that it does <i>not</i> take much to provide someone with an outline, if you have
    what it takes. If you can&#39;t help, or don&#39;t feel like it, just go by. I
    don&#39;t <i>care</i> whether you roll in the money or not, but when you start
    talking about charging money for five minutes of your time, you are making an
    arse out of yourselves. We are not talking about greed here, but arrogance. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ll comment on the original post that started this thread: It&#39;s not
    illegal to make an outline of a typeface and share it with someone else, nor do
    I think there is anything ethically wrong with that. Comparing an outline of a
    few letters with a font sounds like a bad joke -- there is much more to a font
    than that. It&#39;s almost an insult to someone who actually <i>has</i> created
    more than just a few letter outlines. It&#39;s not bold to politely ask for free
    help as the guy did. If anything, it&#39;s <i>daring,</i> and I wish there were
    more daring guys like him. <BR> <BR>To Yves: No, the typography section on my
    webpage is not my idea of being funny. In fact, I haven&#39;t written anything
    more boring than what you can read there. There are even some factual errors in
    there, like the claim of non-existence of system-wide font substitution in Win2000,
    but I&#39;m too lazy to correct all that shite. On the other hand, I don&#39;t
    take myself too seriously, so you are welcome to laugh at my boring babble if
    you think it&#39;s funny. <BR> <BR>&#40;I don&#39;t understand -- if everyone
    disagrees with me, who the f&uuml;ck voted my first comment so high? Should I
    suspect you guys for pulling off some kind of prank on me? I don&#39;t think this
    is amusing.&#41; <BR>'

    you do work honestly as a designer or even as someone who designs type, you always
    end up underpaid, except if by some magic trick you end up being the next Neville
    Brody, David Carson or Stefan Sagmeister. You always put love in your work and
    do the details and stuff like that ... an no client ever pays enough for that.
    You don&#39;t become a designer for the money... and if anybody does, he or she
    will end up disappointed. As with any craft, I guess. You do it because you love
    your job.  <BR> <BR>&#62;you should be nice to people around you when  <BR>&#62;you

    charge money for font identification, here it IS free.  <BR> <BR>The problem here
    is that the initial poster from MyFonts.com isn&#39;t willing to spend 35 $ or
    whatever it is on Charlotte Sans and NETWORKING SOLUTIONS LTD. doesn&#39;t sound
    as if he&#39;s doing a work-for-free or thing or a student job here, does it?
    And for a simple sample, there are enough type teasers on the web -- as on the
    Fontshop site -- to get a gif of the visual feeling of Charlotte Sans, but no,
    he wants a useable and scaleable and editable EPS -- ergo he wants to save money
    on not buying the font.  <BR> <BR>If he were a student or would make clear that
    it is pro-bono work, he&#39;d probably gotten his outline. I&#39;ve yet to meet
    a small-minded and petty type-designer.  <BR> <BR>I agree with your initial POV,
    that people should be nice to other people, but most remarks here didn&#39;t strike

    The critical data is not in the outlines. But, for me, it&#39;s much easier to
    buy the actual font because you can do so much more with it, for such a small
    price. If you were to charge for the typesetting service, how much would you charge
    anyway? $50? I&#39;d rather buy the font! <BR> <BR>That brings me to a question...

  body: In future I shall just use the scan that my customer provided and redraw the
    whole word and that way I shall keep everyone happy. How many times have you designers
    out there redrawn a &#39;no smoking&#39; sign even though it was once drawn up
    by a designer who probably doesn&#39;t receive any more royalties for it. <BR>
    <BR>I fully appreciate Isaac&#39;s posting on my site now but I would say that
    photography definitely has far more imagination than a simple few words of a font.
    <BR> <BR>No, I would not class myself as a jerk, clueless or even a leech and
    I sincerely apologise for causing so much trouble. I would just class myself as
    asking a favour that one day I would like to return. As I said, I could have redrawn
    the words by blowing the jpeg up to around 400% but that would have taken time
    and that was against me. <BR> <BR>As a matter as interest, how many of you designers
    have been influenced by other&#39;s work and have incorporated an element of that
    design in your own work? How many photographers have tried to copy Ansel Adam&#39;s
    work, or how many painters have tried to copy Picasso&#39;s work? Do you get what
    I mean? <BR> <BR>Once again, I&#39;ll just spend that extra bit of time recreating
    the whole thing. This was part of a logo for a company based in England and I
    usually contact the particular company direct for their logo and that way I&#39;m
    not in breach of copyright. <BR> <BR>Can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve caused so much
    trouble over a rather innocent request and I can&#39;t apologise enough. <BR>

  body: I don&#39;t see you as a jerk, but a bit uninformed. You didn&#39;t explain
    your needs in the original post, so you got a reaction to the information you
    gave. This gem, &#34;I fully appreciate Isaac&#39;s posting on my site now but
    I would say that photography definitely has far more imagination than a simple
    few words of a font,&#34; only furthers the impression that you don&#39;t understand
    the point &#40;from my perspective&#41;. <BR> <BR>A&#41; The typesetting &#40;or
    copying, as you put it&#41; is only <i>part</i> of the equation. <BR> <BR>B&#41;
    The font <i>as a whole</i> represents a lot of time and energy and creativity.
    <BR> <BR>You indicated in your original post that you wanted to circumvent the
    purchase of a font that you recognized and costs only $40. Why not add that negligible
    cost into your bill? The time spent on the purchase and typesetting alone should
    cover it anyway. Redrawing a font that isn&#39;t made of basic geometric shapes
    is time-consuming and difficult, and will just result in a sub-standard product
    anyway. <BR> <BR>Your needs are understandable, I&#39;m put in that position occasionally
    as well, but you&#39;ve stumbled onto issues that are large and long-running.
    If you want to people to understand your needs and your situation, then write
    clearly and completely next time. Just asking for free font outlines and typesetting
    without explanation doesn&#39;t garner much sympathy. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also curious
    what &#39;imagination&#39; has to do with anything, as well.

    OSX but that&#39;s about as far forward as we&#39;re going to get for the moment.
    We also haven&#39;t had a wage rise in the two and a half years that we&#39;ve
    worked there which basically answers everyone&#39;s question about paying for
    fonts. <BR> <BR>If our boss can&#39;t even be f&#42;cking arsed to give a wage
