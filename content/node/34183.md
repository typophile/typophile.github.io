  of college, we were required to create an identity for ourselves (applied to a resume,
  business card) and then were to incorporate that into a portfolio book. For most
  of the class, it became more about implementing that identity than focusing on how
  the work itself was presented. In my opinion, I don't think anyone generally gives
  a hoot about that identity - only the work in the portfolio. \r\n\r\nWhat is my
  best bet in presenting work in this industry? \r\n\r\nThanks for the help everyone.
  I always receive valid and helpful feedback here.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This is just my opinion, but I'm a fan of pragmatic design. I think it's
    a major part of succesful design.\r\n\r\nAs such, even though we we were pushed
    out the door as graduates with 16\" x 20\" black matte board with spray mounted
    work on it in a $160 black portfolio case that weighed about 200lbs, I think it
    was rather goofy in hindsight...and especially today when quality printing is
    so cheap and available.\r\n\r\nAs such, I'd suggest making a nice booklet...be
    it 8x11 or ledger or what have you. Color laser printed, nice cover. Something
    nice, but no so nice and expensive that you don't mind just leaving with the person
    you are interviewing with. I also like the idea of using removable bindings (I
    like the medical clips) to make it easy to pass items around a table when multiple
    people are viewing your work.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, a handful of real, printed
    samples of pieces is always nice to have as well.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm sure someone
    else will come in and say that they are, actually, impressed with large hand-made
    industrial looking portfolio cases, and I imagine that's true, as well. Just not
    for me.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In a school/university environment (I used to teach), the recommendation
    is always \"Show only your best work,\" the cr\xE8me de la cr\xE8me as it were,
    even if that's only a half-dozen pieces. I'm not sure I ever agreed with that.\r\n\r\nIn
    the \"real\" world (where i am now), it really comes down to what have you got,
    and what do you want to show? When I look at portfolios, I enjoy seeing lots of
    stuff; it's nice if it all hangs together, but I'm also impressed with a range
    of work.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that you (likely) will not know the needs of the
    client/studio before you go in for your interview. You've only got the one shot
    (usually), so try to be flexible.\r\n\r\nFor example, my portfolio (now ancient)
    was a box-type case, fairly large (and not in the greatest shape - i got it used),
    and I stocked it with just about everything I could think of that I had created
    in the last $%#&! years. It still has some ancient stuff, including marker comps
    and airbrush comps, just in case. The last time I actually interviewed (most of
    my jobs have been word of mouth anyway), it turned out the studio was looking
    for more of an illustrator (rather than a designer), and my earlier (non-computer)
    sketches and technical illustrations came in really handy. After being hired,
    my position morphed into a designer (they already had good traditional illustrators,
    but they really needed a Mac guru/designer/art director).\r\n\r\nI know some out
    there will disagree, but I say put as much as you can into your book, then pull
    out and show the best when you get there, modifying it with what the needs of
    the client are. Start with the best, in case you've got limited time, but more
    often than not the interviewer will just keep asking to see more... we're artists
    too, and we love to see your work. Since you're coming out of school, you'll only
    have the wacky \"fictional\" stuff, but it reminds us of our school days. If you've
    got \"real\" world work, even banal stuff the client sucked the life out of, put
    that in too -- we all know too well the limitations of idiots, but \"real\" work
    shows more than talent... it shows experience.\r\n\r\nThe harder dilemma is putting
    together a \"drop-off\" package. You'll find a lot of job listings requiring you
    to either A) drop off or mail your book, or more likely B) mail in samples of
    your work. For this, you'll need to edit your choices of work down to a coherent,
    reasonable grouping, unless you're made of money and can afford all those color
    copies. The hardest part of this scenario is not being there to explain/highlight
    your work... it will have to stand on it's own, so don't be afraid to use some
    method (an outline, post-its) to briefly explain what they're looking at.\r\n\r\nGood
    Luck!"

  body: "Have different portfolios for different interviews. If you\u2019re going
    to a publishing house, they probably don\u2019t give a damn about your self-banding.
    A big marketing firm, OTOH, might be really impressed by it. This is why it\u2019s
    so easy to swap the pages in and out of portfolios.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t try presenting
    stuff on boards unless you have to. Remembering the order and what to say about
    them is a bugger. If you want something that\u2019s less sterile, design a portfolio
    book (I know a guy who leaves handmade casebound portfolio books behind at interviews.)
    that has the feeling you want."

    very nice.\r\n\r\nI used to do the black matte board thing too, very cumbersome.
    Then I switched to a black leatherette binder which did the trick because I can
    swap things in and out for different clients. And I bring along a sampling of
    books I've done, also customized for the client."

  body: "Well, I teach in the \"real\" world and I have a \"virtual\"<code>.pdf</code>
    portfolio, still I can say that the effort I put designing a book (hardcover,
    letterpress in Quirinus) with many \"extra\" pieces (by the way alienated under
    \"academic works\" for the sake of uniformity or the hell of it), led me to the
    great experience of studying in Helsinki yet living in Finland.\r\nSo \"my\" advice
    is, <em>What is life if, full of care / We have no time to stand and stare.</em>"
