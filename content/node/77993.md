  wanna just get Regular, Bold, and Italic but the Medium, Black and Condensed look
  so tempting. Should I get italics for each variation? \r\n\r\nExcept, $915 for the
  whole collection is a little ridiculous for my budget. \r\nDoes anyone know if FontFont
  gives student discounts? :D"

  body: "Text: For the most basic use reg, italic and bold is fine. A really complicated
    editorial task might need medium or semibold+italics (or even better, a smaller
    optical size) and at times also a bold italic. But is DIN a text face? And how
    dark do you want your \"regular\" to be?\r\n\r\nDisplay: Anything goes, but the
    zeitgeist seems to be high contrasts: very dark vs. very light, thick vs. thin,
    or ornateed/untypical details: and in the case of DIN, perhaps the rounded version.
    Editorial work is much more convenient with a condensed and a compressed version.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:
    This all depends on the kind of work you want to do."

  body: "Thanks! I was wondering though: if you're using a Regular weight for your
    copy, when you bold that, do you use Medium (if there is one) or Bold as defined
    by the foundry? \r\n\r\nThe same goes for if you were using Light: do you \u201Cbold\u201D
    it with Regular, or with Medium, or with Bold?\r\n\r\nOr is it up to the setter?\r\n\r\nI
    guess why I'm asking is, in the case of DIN, should I get regular, bold (skipping
    medium), and italic? or medium, bold, and medium italic? "

  body: This depends on the typeface, as some faces have more weights than others.
    Pick a bold that have enough contrast.
