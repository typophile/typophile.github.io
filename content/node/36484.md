    generally, and countless great text effects that might otherwise be a bother to
    implement are built right in, with animated previews in the help file."

  body: You might want to give [[http://www.swift3d.com/|Swift 3D]] a try. And Adobe
    Flash is a natural at motion graphics too (maybe not as good for some purposes
    as After Effects, but it has its place). Did you not get your Illustrator CS3
    in a bundle?

  body: "As far as I can see, all the movies in that playlist on that site, are made
    with Adobe After Effects. Some of the simpler ones might be done with some other
    app, but the majority is pure AE. Which isn't even so difficult by the way, if
    you have experience with timeline- and keyframe-based apps, you should be able
    to make a couple of animations in a day or two. Not as perfect as the Pulp Fiction
    animation of course, but still pretty decent. I have made a couple of kinetic-type
    movies, done in a week or so, without any experience with the program. (I did
    know Premiere and Flash, so then AE is not too difficult). If you don't have experience
    with such apps, then it will take more time to learn.\r\n\r\nI will see if I can
    upload my movs somewhere, but they're about 150mb, and I don't want to compress
    it too badly."

  body: "As far as I know Illustrator does not have any type of animation settings
    built in.\r\n\r\nI have done a few of these as well, and I also think After Effects
    is the best way to go. Motion from Apple is also a great program, but I still
    think AE is better based on its price and the fact that most of us are already
    familiar with Adobe programs. I would also get a book and teach yourself, it isn't
    too hard. That is how I learned. Also the CS3 version of AE is going to be insane,
    they have fixed so many things that made it a frusterating program to deal with
    before, I would try and get the CS3 version if possible."

  body: Ah, yes. Motion, that was the app I was referring to with 'other app'. I heard
    it was supposed to be ok. But I agree AE is the way to go. The majority, if not
    all, of those movies that are so popular are made with it.

  body: "Illustrator doesn\u2019t animate. I think Adobe was looking at bringing SVG
    animation into Illustrator when their Flash imitator tanked, but that stuff never
    really went anywhere.\r\n\r\nUsing 3D apps to do your animation can work well,
    but they won\u2019t be nearly as easy to learn as After Effects. In terms of application
    design, After Effects is just like Photoshop with keyframe animation and a scripting
    system tacked on, which makes is extremely easy to learn, at least if you\u2019re
    already familiar with Photoshop. 3D apps tend to be much more complex. Previous
    versions of Flash have never been able to export working movies, just SWF files,
    so unless this changed in CS3 Flash isn\u2019t the best choice. And because of
    the way Flash handles in-between frames, it can also be a PITA to do serious animation
    in because it requires extra steps for no good reason other than the original
    programmers were absolutely horrible application/UI designers."

  body: I'm not sure what you're talking about James. Flash has been able to export
    Quicktime movies since at least version 4. Indeed, some special workflow considerations
    have to be made for that specific output, but that's true of any multipurpose
    development thingy.

  body: It's supposed to encode quicktime normally, but it usually is a pain. And
    when it works, I often can't read those exports into apps like Premiere or something.
    I don't what the problem is. I've actually sometimes had to record my screen while
    playing the animation to get a somewhat decent mov. Not ideal.

    unplayable. I was never able to get a working Quicktime movie of any kind out
    of Flash 8, no matter what I did. After Effects, on the other hand, has never
    failed to render me a working Quicktime file. "

    it\u2019s probably worth a shot, otherwise you might end up sinking a lot of time
    into figuring things out. It\u2019s worth noting that their code is from 2002
    and doesn\u2019t come with much in the way of compilation instructions, so unless
    you enjoying fighting to build a binary, it\u2019s gonna be nasty. \r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I did stumble across <a href=\"http://www.jahshaka.org/\">Jahshaka</a>, an open-source
    editing and effects suite that looks promising. I\u2019m getting ready to put
    together a video clip this week, so I\u2019ll be giving it a try. Here\u2019s
    <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=24035&package_id=32439&release_id=452564\">a
    link to the binaries over at Sourceforge</a>.\r\n\r\nI am wondering if Youtube
    will spark Adobe to release an \u201CAfter Effects Elements\u201D for people who
    want to mess around with animation and video effects, but don\u2019t have a need
    for all the high-end tools built into the not-remotely-inexpensive Standard and
    Professional versions. If they don\u2019t do it soon, Apple will."

  body: on Jahshaka? i'm very curious to see this work, and see how fine is Jahshaka
    on the AfterEffects (and alike) replacement - i replaced Freehand/Illustrator
    with Inkscape, Photoshop with Gimp, Fontographer/Fontlab with Fontforge - and
    i'm really wished to replace AfterEffects with Jahshaka - it's seems to be a really
    promising open-source app!
