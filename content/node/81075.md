body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI'm really interesting to find out what font this is. For a document
  which has such a small print it is so easy to read. i've tried various font identifiers
  but im not convinced. I attached a pdf because any image or scan i made distorted
  the font. I would like to know what size they are using in this document too. Any
  help would be much appriciated as i would like to purchase this asap.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nPaul"

    editing > Touch up text tools, then select the characters and choose \"Properties\"\r\n\r\nAnd
    to get the copyright, I need to use FontForge:  Copyright BVG und MetaDesign 1996,
    published by FontShop International for FontFont release 21.\r\n\r\nAny better
    way?\r\n\r\nMichel"

    font properties in acrobat. \r\n\r\nProblem is it's a restricted font on font.com
    and i can't buy it online as i live in australia. \r\n\r\nWhat are my options??
    \r\n\r\ncheers"
