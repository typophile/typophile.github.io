  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I just came across the results of the 4th Founder Award Competition in Chinese type design, which can be seen <a href="http://www.foundertype.com.cn/ztds_4_zpzs.htm">here (in Chinese)</a>. There are also critiques in English by Akira Kobayashi on some of the entries.</p>
<p>There are lots of good entries, but one that caught my eye was this an effort by Wang Tianjia (王天甲), titled &ldquo;Chinese Characters Squared (汉字的平方)&rdquo;. Or at least that&rsquo;s what I think it means; I don&rsquo;t speak Chinese, so I&rsquo;m relying on my knowledge of Chinese characters and a dictionary.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4zpzs_yxj_13_3731.jpg]</p>
<p>At first glance, it seems pretty normal, having a somewhat complicated look, like a text set in traditional Chinese. But for those who can read Chinese, what&rsquo;s amazing about this is that it is in fact simplified Chinese, but many of the elements of the glyphs have been multiplied&ndash;two strokes where there should be one, three where there should be two. Wang has created something like the effects of double vision, but disguised in a way that still looks sensibly like regular Chinese characters. It&rsquo;s something like unsimplified Chinese. Quite imaginative.</p>
<p>For comparison, here is another entry for the competition showing how the same exact characters <em>should</em> look.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Indeed very amazing!</p>
<p>Not being trainedin Chinese, I wonder whether the letters, especially whole texts are immediately readable by a native reader of simplified Chinese, or would readability suffer, be reduced to &ldquo;being able to spell it out&rdquo; instead of reading it fluently.
So would that qualify as a decorative font only, or also as text-font?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Definitely a decorative font.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s surprisingly readable. At least, I don&rsquo;t think a native Chinese reader would have any trouble reading passages like this, any more than a native English reader would have any trouble reading something set in the more experimental but successful display faces. (It would really have to be a passage of more than just a couple of characters so that the concept of the design is apparent, since just a couple of characters in isolation would just puzzle the native Chinese reader.)</p>
<p>Being Korean, I myself don&rsquo;t read Chinese, but I&rsquo;m familiar enough with the characters to recognize most and even to read a few. It would be nice to get an opinion from a native Chinese reader, though.</p>
