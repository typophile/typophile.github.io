  body: "<blockquote>...and whether the .alt glyph(s) appear in an OTF feature within
    the font.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat's the key. Ultimately, InDesign seems to have
    to associate a character name with a Unicode number. If a glyph itself does not
    have a Unicode number, it needs to use a feature definition to so associate.\r\n\r\nWe've
    have trouble with this issue. Take a font where the lining numbers are not the
    deault -- that is, don't have any Unicode number. If they are not hooked up to
    the numbers with a feature -- say lnum, they wind up with the name NULL in the
    InDesign pallet. \r\n\r\nWorse, if you enter one via the glyph pallet, it will
    give you the right character on that machine only. Put the file on another machine,
    and all NULLS being equal, there is no telling what you'll get, but it likely
    won't be what you want.\r\n\r\nWe helped a customer track down a problem with
    a jacket they had prepared that had just this problem. Took me a while. Actually,
    all I really know is that as soon as I associated the glyph with another glyph
    that had a Unicode number via a OT feature, the problem went away. Take out the
    feature, it came back. QED...  "

  body: "Glyphiac, a font contains a lot of information besides the glyphs. One of
    these is a set of OpenType features \u2013actually, codes saying exactly what
    you asked: alternative glyphs, substitutions and specific styles.\r\n\r\nFeatures
    are pre-defined OpenType groups of commands. Take for example the <strong>hist</strong>
    feature. It is used to replace regular glyphs with its historical, archaic versions.
    A quite common code is:\r\n\r\n<pre>feature hist {\r\n    sub s by longs;\r\n}
    hist;</pre>\r\n\r\nThe substitution above replaces the regular s with the old
    longs.\r\n\r\nAnother feature is <strong>smcp</strong>, which means \"small caps\".
    It defines all substitutions the application should apply when the user set this
    style. A sample:\r\n\r\n<pre>feature smcp {\r\n    sub a by A.sc;\r\n    sub b
    by B.sc;\r\n    sub c by C.sc;\r\n} smcp;</pre>\r\n\r\nHere, you have the A.sc,
    B.sc, and C.sc glyphs in your font, and say they will replace a, b, and c when
    using small caps. Of course, a proper code will define this change for the whole
    alphabet, not just a-b-c. And the code must actually include some additional info,
    like the script used (Latin, Greek, etc.) and the language context.\r\n\r\nTo
    make things easier, there is another portion of codes included in fonts: the OpenType
    <strong>classes</strong>. A class is just a reunion of several glyphs into a name.
    For example, you can create the class \"lowercase\" with all a-z alphabet and
    \"smallcaps\" with the corresponding A-Z small caps. Then, you abbreviate the
    <strong>smcp</strong> feature just referencing the class:\r\n\r\n<pre>feature
    smcp {\r\n    sub @lowercase by @smallcaps;\r\n} smcp;</pre>\r\n\r\nFont editors,
    like FontLab Studio, Glyphs and Robofont, offer a panel or window to let the designer
    edit these codes, which are embedded into the .otf file when the font is generated.
    Type designers must carefully choose the features the font will offer and include
    all needed glyphs into it.\r\n\r\nThis is just a small explanation about OpenType
    codes. There are fonts with very few instructions like these and other with tons
    of replacements. You can find a lot of material regarding this on the web, especially
    here in Typophile. To find them, use the \"site:typophile.com\" as an argument
    in Google search:\r\n\r\n<code>OpenType features site:typophile.com</code>\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps."

  body: "George: Sure.\r\n\r\nLet's suppose you're using the open source Alegreya
    bold (not the HT-Pro). You are using it for the chapter number in a book, just
    the numeral itself. But you want the lining figures, not the default, which are
    old style.\r\n\r\nSo you click on it in the glyph pallet, notice that the lining
    figure has a GID number but is otherwise given as NULL. No matter, up it pops
    in the file, you screen it back, place it where you want the chapter number, and
    everything seems to be working.\r\n\r\nNow open the file on another machine. No
    telling just *what* NULL character you'll get.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you
    build a lnum feature, it works perfectly. I surmise that at some level, InDesign
    needs a Unicode number to function properly. By having the lining glyph \"1\"
    associated with 0031 via a OT feature (lnum, in this case), that is done. Without
    the feature, it's just another NULL character, and they're all the same -- NULL.\r\n\r\nYou
    could use a stylistic set, or calt, or ccmp, whatever is appropriate. For something
    that is purely an ornament -- has no legitimate relationship to any character
    as given by Unicode -- we assign a private-use Unicode number.  At least that
    alerts anyone making further use of the file that some investigation is needed.
    \r\n\r\nSome of the old Type 1 fonts are particularly problematic in this -- they'll
    have ornaments in Latin character positions. Of course, as soon as you change
    fonts, or create an XML file, etc., you get that Latin character. And sometimes
    adding a character results in a different word still in the language, which can
    be an oops (Say, for example, \"P\" is taken up by an ornament. So, you have \"ornament\"
    then \"oops\"...Indeed.\r\n\r\nThe rule in our shop is any glyph in a font either
    (1) has a Unicode number or is, via a valid OpenType look-up, (2) associated with
    a character that has a Unicode number. Further, if it's an ornament, that will
    be a Private Use number, which has no syntactic meaning. In no case will any Unicode
    assignment be a \"lie.\""

  body: Thanks Charles. I figured out how to do it using salt and it seems to work
    fine now -- at least for my ten or so .alt glyphs. The only remaining problem
    is that InDesign CS6 still lists dieresis and dotaccent as NULL. Given that they
    have their own Unicode number, that is very odd.

  body: "George, I suspect the font you're using is to blame for that. I opened up
    CS6, created a \"new\" document, and picked Minion Pro - regular as the font for
    the text block. \r\n\r\nIn the Glyph pallet, the dieresis shows as Unicode 00A8
    (not what I'd use, but it is valid...). In the glyph pallet, even the case and
    small cap diereses showed, and <strong>not</strong> as NULL -- they were \"associated\"
    through the case and the c2sc & smcp features in the font.\r\n\r\nAs far as accents
    go, when I remake a font, I take out this legacy encoding and have two diereses,
    one a spacing modifier, one a combining diacritic. (Our fonts aren't for sale,
    so \"legacy\" issues don't come up.) Again, both have the proper Unicode number
    assigned. I don't have the \"case\" associated, as I always make up a component
    glyph in FontLab and access it either directly (if in the Unicode index) or through
    ccmp. If you use mark and mkmk, you won't be making up precomposed characters,
    so you'd probably need to include any .case or .smcp accents in the appropriate
    OT features -- case, and  scmp & c2sc.\r\n\r\nIn short, I still think that if
    <strong>in the font</strong> the glyphs have either the proper Unicode assigned,
    or are associated with such a glyph, all will work. Not had this approach fail
    me yet, and we do a lot of scholarly books that get into some strange languages,
    including Native American ones."

    I'm getting too far off topic, but this happened to a customer of ours, who asked
    for help diagnosing a problem with a book jacket she'd prepared. She had wanted
    a prime -- usually not included in fonts these days -- and had sort of found one,
    but it was neither encoded nor linked to an encoded character. It was caught in
    the printer's preflight as a strange character. Certainly not a \"primey thing.\"
    When I looked at her files, it was there, as a NULL character. I assumed that
    was the problem.\r\n\r\nNow with a four-color jacket, the printer had almost certainly
    taken things apart to make the separations. What was sent to the printer was a
    (single) PDF. I assumed it occurred at that step, even though the printer was
    using the same fonts, but on a different system.\r\n\r\nWe had a similar instance
    occur within our shop, no color work involved. I don't remember the character,
    but it was one glyph on one machine, a different one on another. We just made
    a rule that no NULL characters could appear in any final file.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    I had some tidying up to do as well, as I'd put things in the font file with no
    linkage, such as the .case accents I use only to make up glyphs within Fontlab.
    It's the sort of thing that can happen to anyone if they're not thinking about
    consequences. I fully understand it is hard for a small shop type designer to
    anticipate all this, esp. as I've done it myself."

    0300 through 036F, and spacing modifiers, 02B0 through 02FF.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't
    matter what a book is about, the author may want, say, to thank some Vietnamese

    font if needed. But it's nice to have characters in the fonts used, to avoid losing
    a lot of time investigating size, weight, and to some extent, position.\r\n\r\nPrecomposed
    characters aren't necessary if there are just two or three occurrences, but having
    the <strong>right</strong> bits & pieces is a real help. The files sent off to
    the printer for a book become the basis for any eventual XML files for archival
    or research purposes. They may well be the basis for any digital editions. As
    such, they should have the correct Unicode characters -- for example, not use
    U+2019 for a glottal stop, but preferably, U+20BC. (Or U+20BB in Hawai'ian [Polynesian]).
    A base character plus a combining diacritical is syntactically correct, even if
    there is also a Unicode assignment for a precomposed character.\r\n\r\nSo, you
    can have a trade book on flower-growing and still run into a name or two needing
    such, and the author wants it right -- after all, they can get things \"right\"
    on their word processor, can't they.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, things can get pretty
    specialized, and may not be worth the type designers time."
