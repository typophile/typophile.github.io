body: "Hello dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm working on typesetting a document with mixed
  latin and greek text. My problem is not being able to find out what font was used
  for the greek, or even a suitable replacement.\r\n\r\nThe \"manuscript\" that I
  received is an XML file, so I have no information on what font was used for the
  typesetting of the previous edition, and I'm having a hard time finding out what
  font was used.\r\n\r\nThe main problem, rather than knowing the exact typeface used
  (it could be changed for the new edition) is that the encoding is very strange:
  for all regular greek letters, the actual text is in latin letters, following the
  encoding of the old \"WinGreek\" font - a for alpha, b for beta, etc. However there
  are also accented characters which are indicated in the xml by an entity, i.e. &iacugr;
  for small iota with acute; these can be easily converted to their actual unicode
  points or even a private area one, etc. \r\n\r\nI've already searched trough a lot
  of sites to try to find something that matches this encoding - let's call it \"WinGreek
  Extended\", but so far I haven't been successful. Does anyone know of such a font?
  \r\n\r\nContact with the previous typesetter is very very hard (previous problems
  took literally a year to be answered) so any help is appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

  body: "This is probably a custom encoding, and most likely the old<a href=\"http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~pinax/greekkeys/\">GreekKeys</a>
    encoding, as this was the most popular for Polytonic Greek among scholars. Ideally,
    you would want to identify the custom encoding and then convert the Greek text
    to Unicode.\r\n\r\nYou may find this paper useful:\r\nhttp://ucbclassics.dreamhosters.com/djm/unicodeTalk/unicodeMontrealAPA.html"

  body: This sounds like a mixture of TEI XML and one of the old 8-bit encodings (GreekKeys,
    WinGreek, or one of the others). If they're intermingled within the same passages,
    this may be some sort of strange hack by the previous typesetter. It would be
    more work to convert it automatically into Unicode if it mixes two systems; if
    you can't get the information from the previous typesetter, you may need to put
    together a conversion table yourself.
