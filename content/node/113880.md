body: "I'm working on a layered font family and everything is great in InDesign, but
  the alignment is off by about 1 or 2 vertical points in Illustrator when I switch
  between styles. Does anyone know if this is normal?\r\n\r\nI'm a little nervous
  to release a font that doesn't \"line up\" in all programs.\r\n\r\n"
