    body: That seems like quite an optical stretch for an H. It might get an arm ache.

  body: I think it's very beautiful, but also agree that you should solve the H. And
    in my eyes it's not optically centered in the circle - the swash on the H could
    start a little bit earlier to make it feel more optical centred and give a little
    bit more room to the left.  Just a personal opining =)

    to read a u in there somewhere without the dots.

  body: "Humili, yes of course there would matematically be less space on the left
    (and more on the right) but optical it would look more centered I believe. Especially
    when the little \xAE also is there on the right to make the optical illusion even
    more visible.\r\n\r\nIt feels like the actual word \"Humili\" optical really starts
    a little later then the most left part of the swash, and that you should make
    the centering position with this in mind.\r\n\r\nSee what I mean (my idea is to
    the right) - I think your original is somewhat off centered, optical that is.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Humili1_6380_optical_4394.jpg]"

  body: Thanks very much guys. I thought the only thing making the logo really special
    was because there was no bar between the H and no dots on the I's. Legibility
    sucks!!!

  body: 'Having the logo have too easy legibility could take away from it''s interest.
    In some logos a tension can help create interest - but if you have a logo that
    isn''t readable enough it won''t work. It''s a balance. I think your on the wrong
    side o'' da fence there with this ''readability sucks'' stuff. I guess if it''s
    a logo for a punk band it might be okay. Then your sentiment might match the intent
    of the logo... yeah: " Doo doo dah dah legi-bi-lity, sucks sucks sucks..'' . What
    kind of designer are you? Maybe that punky kind? '

  body: "I am aching to see the top left swash on the H join the crossbar, or at least
    the appearance that it could make a smooth join if one doodled on it, I would
    also like to see the swoosh make a more dramatic downward sweep. I would also
    try aligning the loop of the \"l\" with the upward stroke of the 1st \"i\" and
    moving the dots of the \"i's\" to make the spaces either side of the \"l\" appear
    equal. A joining spur on the first stroke of the \"u\" might help, as might making
    it slightly wider.\r\nVery cheerful looking logo.\r\nTim"

    without the bottom swoosh. For some reason it's just seems so Amazon.com to me.

  body: "I think your logo is quite good! I would maybe look at putting a break between
    the H & the u. There is alot more contrast in the H than in the rest of the letters.
    I think you might want to address that. What does Humili mean? Is it about 'Humility'
    or is it a name, or a word, or a nonsense word like 'Camry'? \r\n\r\nI wonder
    if it should be bigger  & maybe higher in the circle. \r\n\r\nMostly what I wonder
    is if you are going to re-draw the whole thing to give it more flow & maybe more
    verve. All the tweaks have combined to give the logo a little bit of a fragmented
    appearance."

    Look at the m. The l is a bit thin compared to it. See what I mean?

    bothers me a bit and the whole thing is sitting a little low in the circle--I
    know that might be intentional, but looks a little wrong--so move it up or down
    even more. I also keep wanting to move the registration mark up a little--also
    hanging down. Maybe not.\r\n\r\nRemember that when we get to this really \"picky\"
    part, you know it's really starting to come together.\r\n\r\nOkay, that was ten
    minutes of my professional advice--where's my five bucks? :)"

    \"H\" is  completely right either, the stroke doesn't seem to flow as smoothly.
    \r\n\r\nIt's as if you had a really great looking Capital \"L\" and you tacked
    on the bar and other stroke to make an \"H\". It's just not as tight as the rest
    of your letters. \r\n\r\nAs a personal Logo, this is definitely high-caliber! "
