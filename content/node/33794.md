  when did we start celebrating anniversaries of typefaces? Did anyone celebrate the
  50th of Clarendon, Caslon or Jenson? I think not. What makes Helvetica so special?
  And why is Univers missing out on all the love?"

    thought this comic was okay funny, but inaccurate about the origins of Comic Sans.
    [[Vincent Connare|Vince]] is proud of his work, but even he doesn't consider himself
    God."

    to petition my local AIGA to try to bring it to town?

    With a cake.\r\n\r\nDan, the hope is that Helvetica will be the first face among
    many\r\nthat can get a movie done about it. And a cake for its birthday.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant,\r\n\r\nI was lucky enough to see Helvetica on a day when Gary Hustwit
    was there for a question and answer session. He indicated that, while there should
    certainly be more films about graphic design or visual communication in general,
    that he didn't know if other individual typefaces would stand up as the subjects
    of those films.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that I really like about Helvetica is
    how the typeface became a sort of filter through which a larger discussion about
    the merits of modernism vs. postmodernism was conducted. Do you think other typefaces
    could do this, generally speaking?\r\n\r\njarrod\r\n "

    debates (which is of course a great way to make such films interesting\r\nto many
    more people). Think of the rise and fall of the Didone for example.\r\n\r\nHey,
    a movie version of G Knuttel's \"The Letter as a Work of Art\", where \r\nfonts
    are paralleled with other cultural artefacts, would be incredible!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
