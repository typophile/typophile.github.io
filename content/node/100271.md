  suggest something close) for the words \"C. HERING.\" and \"London.\" in this old
  bookbinder's seal. \r\n\r\nI've gotten the close fonts for \"Bound by\" and \"N.
  70 St Martin Street\" but haven't been able to figure out the ones mentioned in
  the above paragraph. \r\n\r\nAny assistance is greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\nBobby\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bookbinder_seal_5304.jpg]"

    could work for London, and Caslon Openface for C HERING.

  body: "Thanks for your suggestions! I really appreciate them. Caslon Openface is
    close but not bold enough. As for Celestia Antiqua, I'm not looking for antiqued
    effect font for London. I was hoping that it is some old classic font that is
    still available. If you have any other ideas, feel free to keep 'em coming. \r\nThanks
    again! \r\n\r\nBobby"
