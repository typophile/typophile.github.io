  didn't seem to bother my reading process.\r\n\r\nBasically I see it as a way to
  save space and/or page transitions and/or scrolling via a reduction in leading.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you guys think?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Functionally, it seems pretty solid, and I'm only a little surprised by how
    good the results in the Stanford study were. Practically, there's the problem
    that we already have a well established convention for the use of colour on the
    Web as signalling hypertext links. I notice that in their homepage demonstration
    they nowhere have a link embedded in Beeline-styled text; the one place where
    they do have a text link on the page is the one place where they've not applied
    the gradient styling.

    then that's great.\r\n\r\nI noticed that in their \"Reading Challenge\" they used
    longer line lengths than I usually see on modern web pages or in e-readers (iPad,
    etc).  I wonder what line lengths were used in the Stanford study."
