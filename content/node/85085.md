  one. Closest I can find is Didot Bold, but it's for sure not that. Any help would
  be much appreciated."

  body: 'I played with this for quite awhile and can only tell you what I think, because
    I know nothing for sure.  I think this is actually three different fonts, one
    for each word(maybe nuts who knows) and it has been messed with, the scale height
    has been increased and it has negative tracking applied for effect.  Very close
    in adobe caslon oldstyle bold and baskerville simi bold.  It appears as though
    outlines were created and a free transform applied without regard to scale(this
    is a no no).  It''s just what I think, and I think it will be next to impossible
    to find an exact match for this reason. '

    find an exact match either, but alternatives include Scotch Modern, Benton Modern,
    Miller, Century, Ingeborg, Mondegreen, Bohemia, Escrow etc. As Jairus observed,
    it\u2019s spaced tighter than textfaces usually are. That\u2019s also why I first
    looked to ITC, but to no avail.\r\n\r\nBtw, that inktrap on the \u201Cd\u201D
    might be clue."

  body: "Although it obviously <em>is</em> Century, I had to poke around MyFonts quite
    a bit before I could find a version that had the same degree of boldness and condensation.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/century-no1-sb/]]\r\n\r\nThe
    next closest match is Century BQ Bold:\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/century-bq/]]\r\n\r\nThus,
    nothing exactly like it is found from Monotype Imaging:\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/itc-century/]]\r\n\r\nor
    from ITC:\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/itc-century/]]\r\n\r\nor
    among Bitstream's versions of Century 751:\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-751/]]\r\n\r\nand
    the versions of Century Expanded from Elsner and Flake, Scangraphic and URW++
    consist of only the roman and italic, without even a bold."
