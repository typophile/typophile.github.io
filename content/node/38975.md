  greatful if you could answer a few quetions, I only need a few words so it shouldn't
  take long! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Which 3 words would you use to describe Helvetica?\r\n\r\n2.
  Do you have any emotional response to Helvetica and its uses?\r\n\r\n3. In your
  opinion, is Helvetica \u2018neutral\u2019?\r\n\r\n\r\nMark"

    It feels high fashion and classic to me. Many high end european furniture houses
    use Helvetica for their identity: Edra, Cappelini, & Knoll.\r\n\r\n3. Not absolutely.
    Univers is what I consider absolutely 100% neutral- cold- emotionless type. Helvetica
    does have some warmth, dare I say, quirkiness. Or perhaps instead of those qualities-
    attitude. She doesn't exactly wear her heart on her sleeve. If Helvetica was a
    woman she would certainly be one of Helmut Newton's amazons.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    think it is fairly neutral. The reason people have such strong reactions to it
    has more to do with its use/overuse than with the font itself. It is overused

    contemporary, dynamic and hip. Just because the masses overuse it because of Apple
    and Microsoft is no fault of the typeface.\r\n\r\nIn fact, for most graphic designers,
    aren't Helvetica Neue and Franklin Gothic STILL the first two grotesk sans you
    turn to? Why not, they get the job done. Univers is too truly antiseptic, Folio
    is quirky, Akzidenz Grotesk is authentic but less mannered than the big two, News
    Gothic and Trade Gothic are thin and wimpy.\r\n\r\nSo my words for Helvetica I
    guess are 1. dynamic, 2. flexible, and (unfortunately), 3. corporate.\r\n"

    this may be a case of chicken & egg, where it is hard to distinguish whether this

  body: Serif faces are used all the time for display purposes. I don't think the
    concept of neutrality only applies to display fonts either. I guess it could be
    argued that sans fonts, being stripped down, convey more of a "neutral" air. But
    the point of typographic "neutrality", as I understand it, is that the font does
    not draw attention to itself, and there are plenty of serif fonts that this idea
    could apply to. Times Roman for one. Minion for another. Janson, Baskerville,
    even some Caslons are very understated.

    do convey more of a \"corporate\" feel and are in more common use. Ironically
    since the sans is probably more \"innovative\" and the serif more \"classic\"
    ergo neutral?\r\n\r\nBut this thread is about neutralilty, not in any particular
