  (http://www.monotype.co.uk/neosans/) The reason why I am not able to use Neo Sans
  is because it does not have a Cyrillic alternative and so I am forced to find something
  similar.\r\n\r\nIf any of you have suggestions, that would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nVlad"

    myfont.com and the option for cyrillic didn't show any glyphs so I assumed it
    didn't have any.\r\n\r\n\r\nVlad\r\n\r\n\r\n"
