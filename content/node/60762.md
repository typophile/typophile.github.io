body: "hi,\r\n\r\n i'm just working on a corporate design for a mideval castel that
  is beeing transformed into a christian conference center. the windowblinds of the
  castle have a very strong and characteristic graphic design (see image) which i
  would like to take up for the new logo. unfortunately i have no idea if this is
  just a nice pattern or whether there is some symbolic meaning attached to this.
  has anybody come across this sign yet? I'm thankful for any comment on this. \r\n\r\n\r\nthanks\r\ngerhard\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gege04symbol_6400.jpg]"

  body: It could be a stylized [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross|cross fourchee
    or cross moline]], both of which would work as either heraldic (related to the
    history of the castle) or Christian symbols. Can you tell us the name of the castle
    and the conference center?

  body: "Further research (anything is better than working) suggests that this is
    more likely to be a \"saltire ragul\xE9e,\" saltire meaning diagonal cross and
    ragul\xE9e meaning knotted. I note that you're in Austria. That doesn't mean the
    castle is, of course, but if it's someplace in the former Holy Roman Empire, the
    symbol may be derived from Charles V, who, having inherited the Burgundian Netherlands,
    incorporated the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_Burgundy_flag|Cross of
    Burgundy]] into his [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|coat
    of arms]].\r\n\r\nI\u2019d earlier thought your logo looked like a budding branch
    or cross, which would have heavy Christian symbolism, and then I found the coat
    of arms of the [[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/s/stockach.htm|city of Stockach]].
    The stick is a visual pun (in heraldic terms, a cant) on the name of the town
    \u2013 stock in German means stick. And of course the stick is itself canted \u2013
    a double pun.\r\n\r\nYour logo could also be a bilateral form of a [[http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschstange|Hirchstange]]
    (stag horn), as in the coat of arms of [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blankenburg-Regenstein.PNG|Blankenburg-Regenstein]]
    (any chance your client is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenstein|Regenstein
    castle]]?)\r\n\r\nOK, I'm done now."

    the illustration you provide your own rendition of the decor?  Or is that an actual,
    vectorized design found within?\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\ndaniel"

  body: "Thanks gus. Sorry for not answering earlier - i've been in some remoter areas
    lately and was cut from the internet for more than two weeks.\r\nWow. I'm deeply
    impressed what you found on your research. Yes, you are right, I'm from Austria
    and the castle is, too. It's the castle of [[http://www.mittersill-tourismus.at/S94_Nationalparkregion-Ausflugsziele-Schloss-Mittersill_1.html|Mittersill]].
    \r\nSome piece of history:The castle was founded in the 12th century, but was
    burnt down by rioting peasants in 1525 and most of what remains today is from
    the 16th century (and some addons from the 20th century).\r\nWhile the founders
    of the castle were the family of Lechsgem\xFCnd (Bavaria), from 1228 onwards the
    castle belongt to the Hochstift Salzburg, which means it belongt to the archbishopry
    of Salzburg. in 1806 the archbishopry was secularised, but up to 1850 the castle
    was still inhibited by clergy. from 1880 onwards the castle was sold to private
    owners. 1935 to 1967 the castle housed an international sport- and shooting club
    and was accomodation to well known people like Bob Hope, Clark Gable, Soraya,
    Schah of Persia and Henry Ford. today it belongs to the International Fellowship
    of Evangelical Students.\r\n\r\nthanks again for your research.\r\n\r\n@theplatypus:
    the illustration is my rendition. i tried to stick as close to the original as
    i could, though. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/gege04_Mittersill_blind_3507.jpg]\r\n
    there are variations, though, on other window/door-blinds. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/gege04_Mittersill_blind2_4060.jpg]\r\n
    The idea of crossing branches or Hirschstangen might be correct after all. for
    me the most important is, that it has no deeper meaning that might disagree with
    the evangelical foundation of my customer.\r\n\r\nthanks"
