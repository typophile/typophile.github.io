  body: Nicolaj, the graphic is wishy washy It needs to be simplier and stronger.
    The type is fine but I would look into closing up the spacing between the MOL.
    Its floating a bit.  <BR>Now for the hard part what is this company? What do they
    make, or what do they serve. You may need a tag line to help with the idenity.
    Remember the reason IBM and other corporate giants could get away with just a
    name or letter logo is because they could poor millions of dollars into advertising.
    I would guess your client can&#39;t, so make the mark clear and direct to its
    target audience.

  body: '&#62;Dear Daniel, Thanks for your comments. First of all. This is not my
    work. I&#39;m trying to convince my client to change. I have my own arguments
    - in this fase he don&#39;t care about spacing etc. So: what do think they are
    doing/selling at this M'

  body: I would guess that they are a small producer of sustainable wood furniture
    or buildings, probably on the cheaper side price-wise. Or possibly a replacement
    testicle service for burrowing mammals &#40;the curse of not speaking as many
    foreign languages as I would like&#41;. <BR>Tim

    is it could be anything

  body: 'Darrel: &#34; A logo doesn&#39;t not have to be a literal interpretation
    of the product and/or service. In many ways, it&#39;s often better if it&#39;s
    not. &#34; <BR> <BR>Your absolutly right. But what I need is just first impressions
    on this logo. My point is: If the logo in style, image, colours &#40;the greyscale
    is the original colours&#41;, shape etc uses misguiding parameters or if the products
    has changes dramaticly or ..., the logo might be a hampering factor in the companys
    efforts to achieve corporate goals. <BR> <BR>Nicolaj'

  body: The mark looks like something from a McMansion development. The type looks
    like business from the industrials sector.

  body: Thanks for your comments. I thought I&#39;d just disclose the identity of
    the company behind the name and logo. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a danish company producing
    hi-end kitchen table tops in Corian, Concrete, Steel, Oak and Teak. <BR> <BR>The
    products are very expensive and are only manufactured by quality kitchen shops/companys.
    <BR> <BR>This is an examble from their catalogue and you might want to have a
    look on their website <a href="http://www.molballe.dk" target="_blank">http://www.molballe.dk</a>

  body: Hmm...now that we have some context, I&#39;d say that logo has absolutely
    nothing to do with &#39;modern&#39; or &#39;high end&#39; kitchens in terms of
    look and feel. <BR> <BR>And the web site gives off a bad vibe too.

  body: wow, that&#39;s a bad logo. I agree, it doesn&#39;t come close to conveying
    what the company sells. The tree image makes me think of furniture, paper, or
    cleaning products. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m guessing that the area where the company is
    located has a lot of trees and the owner asked whomever designed the logo to include
    that. <BR> <BR>The high end kitchen manufacturers I&#39;m familiar with are bulthaup
    and Varenna, both of which rely on a logotype created out of an existing typeface
    &#40;bulthaup=rotis and varenna=helvetica black, though I could be wrong.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>If the owner wants to compete with those companies, and he can by the
    looks of the picture you provided, then he should really consider a serious rebranding
    effort.
