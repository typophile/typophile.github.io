body: "So I'm well versed in the Adobe/Quark paid apps that can render OpenType features
  but I'm not 100% certain of the available ones either bundled as part of the OS
  or freely available under GNU licenses . . .\r\n\r\nI believe TextEdit on the Mac
  10.4 and higher will render liga among other OT versions . . .\r\n\r\nAbove all,
  I want some way for folks who don't own Adobe or Quark apps to be able to enjoy
  OT features or at least experience them without having to purchase the apps . .
  .\r\n\r\nI'm happy if there are other posts that list these but I wasn't able to
  find 'em and I wanted a specific listing I could always point folks to . . .\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your help gang!\r\nStuart :D"

    Open Type. It's from India, and cost some 20\u20AC. At first I was not interested,
    but now I'm looking at Word World, with megatonnes of silly byproduct. I do not
    want this."
