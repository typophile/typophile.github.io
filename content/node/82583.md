  looking for a non-commercial alternative to ITC Conduit, one that I can then use
  on the web with fontface.\r\n\r\nWould be happy to buy the font but that still wouldn't
  allow me the web licensing and don't want it hosted by anyone else.\r\n\r\nSo, if
  anyone can suggest something close would be really appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    you need a non-commercial version? Why don't you just license the web font version
    of ITC conduit from fonts.com?\r\n\r\nJason C"

    font and then host myself I would but at fonts.com all that gives me is a link
    to something hosted on their servers which won't suffice in this instance.\r\n\r\nNot
    trying to get something for nothing, just trying to find as close as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions. Will consider buying.\r\n\r\nMy only gripe with
    the web-enabled fonts at MyFonts is I'd like something where I make a one off
    payment not a recurring thing. If you can download then host the font yourself
    how on earth do you they enforce that policy, and how do they know how many pageviews
    you get?\r\n\r\nAnyone know of anywhere that sells for a one-off payment or is
    this impossible due to the licenses on commercial fonts?\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

    \u2014\_whether its pageviews or users or time. They don't <em>know</em> how many
    pageviews you get, but you give an honest estimate if you want to be lawful. The
    point is to charge a large corporation more than they would charge an individual
    hobbiest."
