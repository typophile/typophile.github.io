  body: "Note: We have two different typefaces here. (Look at the \"C\", \"G\" and
    \"S\")\r\n\r\nThey have characteristics of  Futura but quite a few aspects are
    off. For one, in Futura the \"M\" is completely different and comes all the way
    to the baseline."

  body: NACHSLAG looks a lot like one of the [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/p22/p22_underground_pro_full_set/|P22
    Underground fonts]] or one of the [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_johnston_std_complete_vp/|Johnston]]/other
    Underground versions. I cant find one that matches up in weight. Maybe I'm wrong
    about this.

    it could be FF SuperGrotesk, but it doesn't match either. Darn."
