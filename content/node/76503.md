  paper for the Harry Potter movies. I''m sure I''m not the first to ask this. I know
  these guys made the typefaces: http://www.crazydiamond.co.uk/. That''s as far as
  I could find though. '

  body: Nice. Thank you! Case closed. So, Crazy Diamond Design created the typeface
    and MinaLima Limited (Miraphora Mina and Eduardo Lima) did the actual layouts
    for The Daily Prophet. Good to know.
