  you around.   With no pretense or agenda, but with no fumbling at the mouth or awkward
  Jr. High silent moments\r\n\r\nAny brands or stores or systems or fonts that come
  to mind?\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

    but, however, [[http://typophile.com/node/75395|this font release]] may be perhaps
    of some interest.\r\n\r\nMaybe you wish to reveal a little more about \u2018your

  body: "I like old signs in raised lettering (cast or stamped iron).\r\nBut then,
    I prefer letterpress to offset lithography.\r\nI prefer all caps, because I know
    that U&lc are trying to control me efficiently and quickly; that may be OK in
    an airport, but I ain't always in a rush. Also, I consider that a few words are
    more like a title, so capitals look nicer and more appropriate. Perhaps this is
    because any individual sign in a system of U&lc may have peculiar word shapes,
    so the layout of individual signs will be neater with all caps.\r\nSlow down and
    touch the typography."

    sign near Disney World. It always makes me smile, but for its whimsy rather than
    its typography.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/disneysign_5189.jpg]"

  body: "I like the signage system (and website) of <a href=\"http://www.airport-cgn.de/index.php?lang=2\">Cologne/Bonn
    airport</a>, using the typeface <a href=\"http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Custom+Typefaces/Simple+K\xF6ln-Bonn/\">Simple

    http://www.ruedi-baur.eu \r\nTry to navigate yourself via \u201CS signal\xE9tique\u201D,
    then scroll down the second column to \u201CA\xE9roporte de Cologne-Bonn 2002\u20132006\u201D,
    then photos in third column. Or see some more <a href=\"http://www.florakron.com/signance-systems02.html\">here</a>."
