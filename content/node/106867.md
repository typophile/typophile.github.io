body: "Hi People,\r\n\r\nI would like to tell you how magnificent Times New Roman
  in Indonesia is. Times New Roman (especially in 12 point for body text) is very
  standard in various writing. Every scientific writings, school assignments, government
  documents, law documents and other non-casual non-modular (i.e like advertisement
  etc) should use Times New Roman. I ever created a assignment in Georgia and my teacher
  in high school rejected my assignment. In every single University in Indonesia,
  all of scientific writing (minithesis, thesis, dissertation, paper etc) must be
  printed in Times New Roman 12. I don't know how why people standardize and convene
  Time New Roman as the one and only formal serif font that able to use in Indonesia.
  This kind of 'natural' convention is really irritating me.\r\n\r\nDid this happen
  in other country? What about western countries?\r\n\r\nGunarta\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Times New Roman is certainly very common, and some colleges in North America
    do insist on its use for theses. Law courts in the United States instead demand
    Century Schoolbook in some cases, if I remember correctly.\r\n\r\nI think Times
    Roman <em>is</em> a very well-designed typeface, probably warranting the adjective
    \"magnificent\", as I feel it bids fair to have the same level of popularity as
    Caslon did. However, I'm not overly fond of Times Titling.\r\n\r\nJust because
    it's a very good typeface, however, is not a good reason to overuse it to the
    exclusion of all else. Garamond, Baskerville, Century Expanded, and Caledonia
    are all very good alternate choices for body copy."

    best choice; there are other reasons why a teacher may require a particular font
    .\r\n\r\nSpecifying a standard format may reduce the number of questions the teacher
    gets about formatting. It prevents students from making poor font choices that
    are hard to read. Also it's easier for the teacher to visually judge the length
    if all students are using the same font and size. \r\n\r\n> is very standard in

    often just because a lot of people are using them, not because they are necessarily

  body: "@Nick Shinn:\r\n<cite>And there are even some quite acceptable faces that

    long</em> for a typeface to become recognized and well-known.\r\n\r\nI know, though,
    that by trotting out the tired old choices that everyone has been using for ages,
    I am being terribly unfair to contemporary type designers who are trying to make
    a living. Still, I assume typographers who are looking for something novel and
    unique are able to find them, despite my lack of help.\r\n\r\nAnd it's something
    of a sad reflection that <em>even</em> more use of 75-year-old typefaces as alternatives
    to Times Roman would be an improvement on its current level of overuse, the merit
    I find in it notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples I found quickly:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/aragon/|Aragon]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/baltica/|Baltica]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/magna/|Magna]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/minister/|Minister]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/timeless/|Timeless]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itf-alanmeeks/brigade/|Brigade]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/impressum/|Impressum]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/el-castillo-sg/|El
    Castillo]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/kepler/|Kepler]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cepuertas/legitima/|Legitima]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/capearcona/ca-normal-serif/|CA
    Normal Serif]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/apollo/|Apollo]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/grandeur/|Grandeur]]\r\n\r\nAnd
    then there's Palatino - or Aldus, which might be considered to be Palatino Book
    - and Imprint, Bembo, Poliphilus, Cloister Lightface, and many other choices."

    of older typefaces. A review done in passing, reading is what's going on. \r\n\r\nOne
    conclusion: Times holds up very well indeed. So well I'm making a variation for
    our shop to use, starting from Nimbus No 9L (for the GPL+FE license). Yes, I'll
    change it a bit, trying for a look more like the old Linotype fonts with long
    descenders.\r\n\r\nPoint is, a lot of the fashionable fonts don't read nearly
    as well. Style -- fashion -- is often just another form of planned (i.e., artificial)
    obsolescence."
