body: don&#39;t get me wrong, i&#39;m completely enamored by FontLab, but why do FontLab&#39;s
  toolbars seem to have a mind of their own? they&#39;re always rearranging themselves
  on me. and last night one of them decided to leave me all together and i had to
  go find him hide-and-go-seek style. wassup with that? is this just happening to
  me? have i completely lost it? or has anyone else noticed this toolbar tomfoolery?

  body: One FL problem is that if you customize the UI at all, then have a crash,
    it resets to the way the UI was the last time you did a clean exit of the program.
    This applies to both which toolbars are on, and what&#39;s on the toolbars. <BR>
    <BR>It would be nice if it saved the UI state when you exit the UI customization.

  body: <i>I lost my magnifying-glass toolbar two weeks ago...</i> <BR> <BR>yes! that&#39;s
    exactly what prompted me to write this! &#40;besides the toolbars shifting around
    on me all the time&#41; i found it again though, i think there&#39;s a button
    on the bottom left hand side i had to click to get that magnifying glass back.
    i couldn&#39;t find it in the drop down menus anywhere...
