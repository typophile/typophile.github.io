  it so much, and have come up with something pretty unsatisfactory. \r\nI can't see
  where else to go with it at the moment, and was hoping for a bit of guidance.\r\n\r\nIts
  an A3 poster, aimed at people interested in all sorts of design.\r\nI wanted to
  achieve a stylish, typographic layout, but could do with a little help, after looking
  at it for too long! Theres a lot of content to shoehorn in.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nToby

    is distracting about the colon after 'SHIPLEY LATES:' to me..."
