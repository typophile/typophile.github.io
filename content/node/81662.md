  resource.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone out there knows what the font is for
  the 'body'(?) of the betfair website, the one that says 'WHAT IS BETFAIR? etc'\r\n\r\nsee
  attached pic, or http://www.betfair.com.au\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aus_whatisbetfair_725x240_5570.gif]"
