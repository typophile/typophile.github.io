body: "If you were injured while you were working, you may be able to receive compensation
  for your injuries. After all, your employer should carry Worker's Compensation insurance.
  Unfortunately, this is something that many employers are not doing. Because of this,
  you may have to contact a lawyer in St. Louis if you have been injured on the job.<p><p>\r\n\r\nFirst
  of all, you need to carefully consider your injuries. Maybe it was something that
  happened suddenly. If this were the case, you would want to fill out an accident
  report. This way, you would have a paper trail of everything that happened. Maybe
  you are currently dealing with carpal tunnel due to repetitive work with your hands.
  This is something that would happen more gradually. This would be another reason
  that you would want to contact a respected <a href=\"http://www.rebelmouse.com/injurylawyerweb/accidents-and-mistakes-happen--741497065.html\">personal

  consultation appointment with you. This way, he can sit down with you and go over
  the details of your accident. Sometimes, the accident may have been your fault.
  If this were the case, remember that you may still have compensation waiting for
  you. This is why you never want to assume that you know how things are going to
  work out.<p><p>\r\n\r\nThe only way that you would ever be held accountable for
  your injuries that were your fault is if you were drinking on the job, behaving
  irresponsibly at work, or if you injured yourself on purpose to get out having to
  work.<p><p>\r\n\r\nYou should never have to pay money out of your own pocket for
  injuries that happened in the workplace. If you do have to pay out of your own pocket,
  make sure that you save receipts for everything. This way, you can ask your personal
  injury attorney in the St. Louis area to help you to be reimbursed.<p><p>\r\n\r\nBrown

  opinion as to which way you should proceed. If you decide that you would like to
  hold your employer accountable for your injuries, your lawyer will get started with
  the necessary paperwork. It won't be long before you start to receive compensation
