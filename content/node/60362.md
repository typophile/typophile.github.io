body: "This is my first go at some book typography; a small edition of Milton\u2019s
  Paradise Lost, with illustrations by William Blake. If I manage to get it together,
  I think I\u2019ll try to print and hand-bind a copy, and make the PDF available
  free.\r\n\r\nAs most editions of Paradise Lost are either ugly paper-backs or beautiful
  but impractically large deluxe editions, the aim of this project is to produce an
  attractively designed version of the poem which is small enough to be readable.
  It may need to be printed in two volumes, as I think the total length will be c.400
  pages. I\u2019m for a vaguely historically informed look to it, whilst adopting
  modern practices which aid readability. Therefore the typeface is Storm\u2019s Jannon,
  with discretionary ligatures but with short Ss (except in titles and the like).\r\n\r\nThe
  poem is in 12 books which comprise a short prose introduction followed by long sections
  of blank verse (c.800 lines). There is a Blake illustration for each book which
  I have inserted between the introduction and the prose. The plan is to have each
  Book starting on a verso, with the illustration on the facing page, so that the
  poetry starts on the next page.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve attached the title pages and the
  start of Book I to this post. Any thoughts about it would be gratefully received.\r\n\r\nThings
  that I\u2019m worried about\r\ni) the half-title page;\r\nii) the vertical alignment
  of the introduction;\r\niii) whether the illustration appears too low compared to
  the header; and\r\niv) whether the left-margin is too large on the poetry pages;\r\nv)
  whether the pages should be reversed (i.e. with sections starting on the recto...which
  perhaps should have odd numbers).\r\n\r\nAny other thoughts or criticisms would
  be very welcome :-)\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: My main typographic issue is the fluctuation of the long "s." It really seems
    odd to use it in some places and not others, particularly on the same page (as
    you do on the folios vs. the body text). I would pick one and use it consistently.

    Lo\u017Ft (which appear only on the title page and in the running titles) but
    I\u2019ll revert to sort Ss if it looks inconsistent.\r\n\r\nDo you have any views
    about the page layout; that\u2019s what particularly concerns me?"

  body: While I don't know all the "rules" for ligature use, and the s ligatures are
    some of my favorites, I don't think you should use them in the body text.

  body: "Hmm...The S and C ligatures will need some thought; I really like them and
    one of reasons for doing this edition is that there aren\u2019t any that are available
    with them. That said, they do rather stand out. Particularly as, historically,
    most of the S ligatures would be less prominent due to the long-Ss (i.e. there
    would be lots of \u017Ft and \u017Fp rather than st and sp). One experiment might
    be to keep the sp ones and remove the st and C ones, they occur much more rarely.
    Or just keep them in the italic introductions.\r\n\r\nOther changes: I\u2019ve
    changed the titles to Paradise Lost from Paradi\u017Fe Lo\u017Ft. That\u2019s
    also necessitated changing the running title to small-caps to avoid an st ligature
    that looked very out-of-place. I\u2019m not quite sure what to do with the main
    titles as I think the Long-Ss added interest which are now missing.\r\n\r\nCould
    anyone help me with the following? I\u2019ve been putting the names of the main
    characters (i.e. God and Satan) in small-caps. Is that too over-the-top?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    how should the abbreviation of \"the\" to \"th\u2019\" be set? Most of the examples
    I can find set it with a space like this: th\u2019 Empyreal Heav\u2019n, but I
    can\u2019t help thinking it would look better in many cases as th\u2019Empyreal
    Heav\u2019n.\r\n\r\nThe page below is the first one I can find which has Satan
    in small-caps and a \u201Cthe\u201D abbreviated to \u201Cth\u2019\u201D:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pl_test_6272.png]"

  body: "One possible solution, would be to set the title in italics, as the \"\u017F\"
    there has a much more \"s\"-like apperance, and would blend better with the \"modernized\"
    body-copy.\r\n\r\nI understand the desire to use ligatures here, but I fear they
    might distract from an already rather boring text. Could just be my personal aversion
    to Milton though :)\r\n\r\nMaybe a goof compromise would be to use a few basic
    ones (fi,fj,ffi..) in the bodycopy, and some fancier ones for the front matter
    and introduction?\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

  body: "I like the overall look of your layout, it's a nice work. The poetry pages
    are very beautiful and readable. Here's what I don't like;\r\n\r\n- I would set
    the title Paradise Lost with the regular lowercase \"s\", as other people already
    said; this is a book set in 2009, so I don't see why using such typographycal
    anacronysm. Equally, I would disable the discretionary ligatures in the text (ct,
    sp, etc...), they \"disturb\" the reading process, in my opinion. Storm's Jannon
    is a great choice, by the way.\r\n\r\n- What is the exact function of the first
    page, anyway? You already have the title page on page 3.\r\n\r\n- An observation
    on the page layout: the page numbers are too close to the bottom of the page,
    giving the impression that the text block is falling down. You should also increase
    the size of the bottom margins.\r\n\r\n- I would delete the page number on the
    verso with the Blake illustration, it's not necessary.\r\n\r\n- Perhaps, page
    numbers could be 1 point smaller?\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work!"

  body: "@ oprion:\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re right about the \u017F being less intrusive
    in the italics. There\u2019s also quite a nice t swash which works quite well,
    although I would then loose the \u017Ft ligature:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/runningtitlestest_4699.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    Jannon Italic is quite flamboyant so even if I drop some of the ligatures from
    the main text, they could certainly be preserved in the introductions without
    any problems:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/introexample_6214.png]\r\n\r\n(Most
    of them are about half-a-page long so I\u2019m not so worried about the text being
    distracting. Though it occurs to me that if I am to be consistent, Messiah should
    be in small-caps, too.)\r\n\r\nI will put your dislike of Milton down to a lack
    of decent editions ;-) We all know, objectively, that it\u2019s one of the greatest

  body: "@ ncaleffi:\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your post and your suggestions which were
    really helpful. I've added a new PDF incorporating some of the changes you suggest;
    particularly the three suggestions about the page numbers. I\u2019m going to think
    about the ligatures and play around with several ideas.\r\n\r\nI've also messed
    around with the front-matter a bit more. I think the Title Page looks a bit better
    now, but I'm slightly worried that it looks too much like a pastiche of a 17th
    Century one, and perhaps ought to be a bit more modern.\r\n\r\nThe very first
    page is supposed to be a Half Title page (i.e. to be the recto which should have
    the end paper as its verso) but perhaps I\u2019m misunderstanding the book binding
    process? That\u2019s why I was slightly bothered about ending up with the pages
    reversed. At the moment each Book starts on the verso, with the illustration on
    the recto and the poem appearing overleaf. \r\n\r\nFinally, on a different issue,
    I was wondering if there were any suggestions about how to deal with this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clash_6478.png]\r\n\r\nIt
    looks like in the first 6 books (over 5,000 lines) there\u2019s only one line
    which actually clashes with the numbering and about 3 more which are just a bit
    too close. I wonder whether it be preferable to split the line or drop the line
    numbers. As so few lines have this problem, I\u2019m unwilling to move the numbering
    further too the right.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for all your suggestions, again."

  body: "Thanks for all the thoughts so far. I left this a few days for contemplation
    (one of the advantages of being an amateur, I suppose!) and have since been trying
    a few other changes. A new version of the front matter and the first few pages
    should be attached to the front page.\r\n\r\nThe main things that I have changed
    are:\r\nThe margins for the Introductions have had to be increased quite a bit
    so that the long introduction to Book 10 stays on one page. In compensation I\u2019ve
    therefore dropped the running titles from those pages, which I think works quite
    well.\r\nThe location of the line-numbers has moved slightly to the right which
    should, with a bit of luck, avoid the need to break any lines of verse.\r\nA contents
    page allows the first page of each section to be on the recto (and have an odd
    page number).\r\nI\u2019ve heeded the advice and removed the discretionary ligatures.\r\n\r\nI
    think, with all the help here, I\u2019m nearly there. The only thing I am now
    uncertain about is the first page of verse in each book. I can\u2019t help wondering
    whether it needs something more distinctive; I\u2019m slightly worried that the
    \u201CBook x\u201D running title (which appears there for the first time), looks
    more like a title than a running title and makes it seem a little weak.\r\n\r\nIvan:
    If it\u2019s the written form of the book that\u2019s the problem, I could relieve
    you of your hard-copy of the Milton in exchange for the Naxos [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Paradise-Lost-John-Milton/dp/9626343508|audio-book
