  body: I'm not a Mac expert, I've never even left a mobile phone in a pub, but my
    guess is that there's something suspect about the particular fonts that is causing
    OS X to on occasions reject them. Perhaps the recent font related security patches
    are finding something about the fonts that they don't like, perhaps at specific
    sizes - hence them working in some places and not others. What fonts are causing
    the issue?

  body: This problem happens if you have the font installed locally on your machine
    through FontXplorer. Is that the case for you?

  body: Yes that is correct I have FontExplorer and the font is loaded locally. Weird
    issue though, surely it should default to the local version if it is intalled,
    no?

  body: "<cite>in OpenOffice the issue is with bullet points in documents created
    in Word</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's most likely because Word uses symbols from a separate
    source instead of bullet symbols from the font in which the text is set."

  body: "It is a known Chrome bug, it happens with other font managers (not only FontExplorer)
    AND it is unlikely to be fixed anytime soon.\r\n\r\nOne has three options: \r\n\r\nA]
    stop using the font manager software. \r\n\r\nB] Keep all fonts in the OSX designated
    font folders (which isn't a very good option in the case of font managers such
    as FontExplorer)\r\n\r\nC] Forget about using Chrome.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I opted
    for option C (Safari is still the king of speed on the mac platform, and to my
    eyes, is the best WebKit browser for the platform anyway)"

  body: An alternative may be to rename (font name table not the file name) the @font-face
    linked font to a unique name. Probably okay for most open source fonts, eg "Gentium"
    -> "Gentium 1234"

  body: The solution is to not use the local('font_name') declaration in @font-face.
    Use Paul Irish's smiley method and it works fine in Chrome.

  body: "A workaround:\r\n\r\nCopy the text that's showing up as boxes with 'A' in
    them, paste it into textedit. \r\nSelect a word and Command-T to open the fonts
    panel and see what font it is.\r\nNow go to whatever third-party font manager
    you have installed, and disable ALL variants of the font there. \r\nQuit the font
    manager, and now open Fontbook.\r\nYou should see the font in there, grayed out.
    Enable it.\r\nRestart Chrome, and that font will appear just fine.\r\nYou'll have
    to do this for each font, unfortunately. It's a pain, but Chrome's so much faster
    and better that I don't really mind...\r\n\r\n"
