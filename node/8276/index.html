		<div class="commentbody">Agreed, do  not follow the current showings of the Arabic on the Linotype website. I am assisting Linotype in revising these - at the moment they are just trials as the formats vary - and there should be a sensible showing in January. The second page of the pdf samples are just the Latin pages set with Arabic fonts, so they are gibberish. There will be proper textx samples in due course. <BR> <BR>I am pretty certain that all the Linotype Arabic fonts contain Farsi characters (including numerals). The two fonts that are designed for Farsi (note the counters) are Nazanin and Mitra.  <BR>The former is particularly popular but neither are  yet in OpenType format - you would need to contact Thomas Caldwell at Lintoype for a date, also about Hassan if you follow Hrant's suggestion. <BR> Lotus is Linotype's most popular text font for quality bookwork. Yakout is the most popular font for newspaper text and brochures. Both contain the necessary characters and are available in OpenType format (even though the website currently only shows the Type 1 Yakout). The samples John mentions would give you better information. I don't think I have a set that I can send you, but perhaps John would kindly put up a pdf for you of the fonts in which you are interested. Please contact me off-list if you would like further information, although now is a somewhat busy time! <BR> <BR>Fiona</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Titus, the degree to which Latin and Arabic can be &quot;formally&quot; reconciled is indeed severely limited - and when people ignore this they end up with caricatures of visible language which can appeal only to fanatical graphic designers or cultural chauvinists. But whenever the two are in one place they can't just ignore each other either. They have to balance each other somehow or other, and one generally important factor is apparent importance - when one has too much and the other too little you'll piss half the people off - much easier to do than pleasing half the people!  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When two scripts are completely unrelated in form, I find that the best way to harmonise their appearence together &ndash; to reconcile them, to use Hrant's term &ndash; is to carefully balance weight and height so that neither looks too large or too heavy relative to the other. Some of the best examples of harmonious setting of Arabic and Latin text I've seen are actually in very old books, in which two obviously independent fonts have been sensitively combined simply with an eye to their relative size. In this approach, neither script is adapted to the other, but both are allowed to maintain their own authentic characteristics, although the fact that the Latin types in these books are French renaissance book faces with small x-heights and long extenders does help them to harmonise easily with the Arabic. I had this in mind when I designed the Latin portion of the Arabic Typesetting font.* <BR> <BR>*Unfortunately, I think my Latin harmonises better with Paul Nelson's original Arabic design, for which I drew it, than with Mamoun Sakkal's final and much revised Arabic design. Ideally, I should have gone back to the Latin after Mamoun completed his revisiones, but there was no time or budget left for that unanticipated work.</div>

I think a more progressive Latin would have been better. <BR> <BR>BTW, John, about your cataloguing system, so it tells you whether you have something, but doesn't tell you how to find it? :-) I recently organized all my type materials, and now it's much easier for me to find something. I have eight or so categories, with each small enough that it's feasible to search through to find a specific item. But the catalogue is still in my head. Sometimes I forget I have something (although I very rarely I think I have something I don't, which is the biggest time drain) but usually there's at least a faint memory of every single item for me to know which pile to look in. One day I could do a &quot;formal&quot; catalog (which would enable the distinct advantage of having an item in more than one category) but I guess I don't have enough stuff yet for the overhead to be worth it. As one of my first-year Computer Science profs told me ages ago, you gotta know when <i>not</i> to use a computer! <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

I've also got photocopies of some of the pre-PostScript output from the 1970s for a couple of designs. <BR> <BR>The Diwan versions of Linotype faces are problematic, since they only work with Diwan's software. Linotype are intending to release Unicode-OpenType versions in the near future. <BR> <BR> <BR>The next stage of the library cataloguing will be a simple shelf-number system, but I'm holding off doing this until I move and can get things properly organised. Currently about a third of the books are in piles on the floor or taking up table space. The primary goal of the catalogue was, indeed, so I would know what I have. I was standing in a bookshop in London a couple of years ago, holding a volume in my hand, and couldn't remember whether I already owned it. That was when I decided I needed a catalogue. Now I have a fairly detailed catalogue on my PalmPilot.</div>

It is a Microsoft exclusive typeface, originated by Paul Nelson at MS Typography, who drew the first version of the Arabic, which was then revised by Mamoun. It is part of MS's remarkable commitment to quality typography across a range of scripts. In terms of Unicode-compliant text handling, MS Publisher is actually the second-best page layout app for the Arabic script, after InDesign ME. MS Office on Windows has the most advanced complex script support of any software on the market.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>How many books do you have? </i> <BR> <BR>The professional library has about 650 volumes, 594 of which are currently catalogued. Unfortunately, my cataloguer recently took a job with a library in California, so I either need to find someone else or catalogue the recent purchases myself. About two thirds of the library are general, i.e. predominantly Latin, typography and calligraphy, and one third is non-Latin stuff. I expect it to be half-and-half soon, since I'm buying more non-Latin than Latin. Unlike a lot of my colleagues' libraries, which tend to include lots of old type specimen books, most of my collection is what may be termed scholarly, with a lot of palaeography books, which are generally the most interesting material for non-Latin script. <BR> <BR>I'll go to some lengths and expense to get my own copy of a book before I settle for a photocopy. What tends to happen is that I go to St Bride's and browse in a number of areas that interest me, identifying worthwhile books, and then come home and start ordering them through ABE.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good choice for the Arabic&hellip; The latin you show is heavier than the Arabic and the serif treatment is not helping (too straight and unmoving when compared to the flow of the Arabic). You need a latin with softer curves. This Arabic feels very feminine, soft and graceful. It suits persian text and would need a small x-height for the latin. Also, smaller counters in the a and e would probably help. Look at the closed counters and see how small they are? You don't need an e that small, but a large x-height with generous counters will look monstrous next to the delicacy of the Arabic. Definitely some modulation on the Latin. Hope this helps&hellip;</div>

Some of the best Arabic calligraphy started in Spain and Morocco. <BR> <BR>The Latin is much better resolved than the Arabic, which might need some adjustments of its internal proportions.  <BR> <BR>The kufi style is a good choice though the large x-height of the Latin is not helping. It feels also like the Latin flows better than the Arabic. You might need to make some adjustments that will help the rhythm. <BR> <BR>- the mim is too small <BR>- the reh feels like it's tipping backwards. It really needs a vertical stem in the koufi style <BR>- the jim family is a bit unbalanced. The top part moves forward too much <BR>- the beh needs to be wider (comparable to kaf) <BR>- no need for lam-mim ligature. The structure you use is more a naskh than a koufi <BR>- the sin is widely spaced in comprison to the beh family (compare sin followed by teh, and shin followed by nun) <BR>- the waw seems very big (counter is similar in size to mim) <BR>- spacing of &quot;Espania&quot; seems very tight in comaprison to others <BR> <BR>I hope you find this helpful.
