<cite>Hi all,

Well, I never knew if or when this day would come, but I am leaving Adobe after 11 1/2 years. Adobe HR made me an offer I can't refuse, so away I go. On the plus side, I needed to spend some more time with my family due to my younger daughter's medical needs anyway. I will be looking at consulting, writing and teaching gigs, and perhaps going back to a full time job at some time next year. Let me know if you have any good prospects for somebody with lots of type background/skills and an MBA from UC Berkeley.  :)

It has been both a great pleasure and an honor to work with so many smart, knowledgeable and decent people in my time at Adobe, and to help make some great typefaces and applications.

Still, I hope to still see around you in future, T. Maybe at the next TypoBerlin? (Cite tags not working, sorry)

		<div class="commentbody">This is sad news! From about 1995 to 2000, David Lemon was Adobe's universally admired online type community voice, and since then Thomas has filled his shoes so well. I have been a well-known thorn in his side for most of these years, but as Thomas's technical and institutional wisdom grew with every year, it has become harder and harder to find fault. I do think it's a shame for Adobe to part with someone who has done so much for the company in so many ways, and whose loyalty is so admirable. It is impossible to think of the contemporary online type community without Thomas's unflagging generosity. Very best wishes, Thomas!</div>

I have every intention of remaining involved in the type community, including here on Typophile. I am just a little busy these first few days with the transition. Amazing how many sites and services have my Adobe email address... and my inbox and phone have both been very busy.

They're probably banking on a bail-out like everyone else. ;-)

That's capitalism.

A company with billions in annual revenue and dominant in its field, that has enjoyed a lengthy period of growth and profits, cooly lays off thousands of workers ("everyone's doing it, we're matching average industry rates" according to the boss) when there's a downturn in the economy. Somewhat callous, but sensible business practice apparently, although there are always apologists lamenting that those companies are losing their best and brightest.

From the employee perspective, loyalty is not reciprocated, but on the up side, it's during recessions that discarded workers form the start-ups that become the kernels of the next wave. I was laid off during downturns a couple of times, long ago before I started working for myself, and it was always a great opportunity. </div>

And while one hand taketh away, another giveth. You see, "college hires" are a different bucket than all other employees at Adobe.... (I'd comment more, but that would be out of place.)

That would be cool, but I think everybody's hurting right now, business-wise. Makes it hard to hire anybody....

So mostly I'm going to try to enjoy a much more relaxed holiday season with my family who really need my time right now. At work I was always famous for not being able to stop answering email and such, even when nominally on vacation. Not actually *having* work email will make that easier, I guess.  :)

Cheers,
