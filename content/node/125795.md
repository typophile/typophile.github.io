  body: "Thank you for sharing. You will have no doubt seen the samples of  Maryamsoft's
    Mir Emad at the following page:\r\nhttp://maryamsoft.com/MirEmad/\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the Maryamsoft typefaces in general:\r\nhttp://maryamsoft.com/FontShop/\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the discussion -- with flowers -- about its development and how it compares to
    Tasmeem (also with samples):\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/48495\r\n\r\nWhat
    I understand from your list is that different people are developing different
    engines especially to use their own fonts -- either for calligraphy or for running
    text. Presumably, one can't use the nastaliq font from Maryamsoft and use it with
    Adoos, or vice versa. Maryamsoft, therefore, has an advantage in that they have
    a choice of 32 typefaces (some in different weights) whereas Adoos only have 4.
    However, Adoos has a demo and Maryamsoft does not have any demos for Qalam Bartar
    and Mir Emad, as far as I can see."

    qalambartar is for professional users with a better quality fonts. Also miremad
    supported up to office 2010 only, while qalambartar is supported up to office
    2016. I tried qalambartar my self and really liked it. Adoos is mainly a writting
    tool for long texts in nasaliq font    '

  body: "That's interesting, I thought there was not an overlap between the two but
    it sounds as if Qalam Bartar is a more advanced version of Mir Emad. Like Wordpad
    and Word or Paint and Photoshop. Correct?\r\nIn Qalam Bartar can you also move
    characters around to make calligraphic designs? Did you find a demo?\r\nI also
    asked Maryamsoft some questions a week ago but didn't hear anything back."

    of end of verse rings with numbers. This is discussed in their brochure. With
    Qalambartar, this feature appears in their brochure but they do not discuss it.
    Do you have any experience with this feature using the software you have listed?
    I didn't see it in your samples.

    https://www.mushafmuscat.om/ by Thomas Milo and Mirjam Somers from DecoType. A
    fully customized job, from the design of the font all the way up to displaying
    it in a compatible way in browsers. A few quotes (my transl.):\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There
    is nothing special about a web Koran: various sites offer a digital version, such
    as those of the Ministries of Religion of Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. But
    this design is 'radically different', says Milo (67), because of the technique.
    \"This does full justice to the original Arabic writing style on a computer screen.\"</blockquote>\r\n...\r\n<blockquote>\"We
    taught the computer scribal grammar, that means: how will letters be connected,
    and how should they adjust to the next letter. Together with my brother, I wrote
    an algorithm to do this.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n[Original article in Dutch: https://www.trouw.nl/religie-en-filosofie/zoveel-meer-dan-een-webkoran~a5dafc87/]"
