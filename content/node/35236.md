  I wanted to update the Font Collection Starter Pack page:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/30047\r\n\r\nbut
  couldn't remember the URL, so tried navigating to it. Eventually google got me there,
  but was wondering if there is a formal rhyme or reason as to where things should
  be put into the index (and who maintains it)."

    can click on the \"Advanced Search\" options and pare things down from there.\r\nI
    try to do my best to wrangle the wiki, but i can't catch everything. Anyone who
    has a user account can, and should feel free to, edit the wiki. Please index the
    pages as you see fit."
