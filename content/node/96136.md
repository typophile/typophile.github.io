  many abugidas, there is also a diacritic to suppress the inherent vowel, yielding
  the bare consonant. In Devanagari, \u0915\u094D is k, and \u0932\u094D is l. This
  is called the vir\u0101ma or halantam in Sanskrit. It may be used to form consonant
  clusters, or to indicate that a consonant occurs at the end of a word. In Sanskrit,
  thus, a default vowel consonant such as \u0915 does not take on a final consonant
  sound. Instead, it keeps its vowel. For writing two consonants without a vowel in
  between, instead of using diacritics on the first consonant to remove its vowel,
  another popular method of special conjunct forms is used in which two or more consonant
  characters are merged to express a cluster, such as Devanagari: \u0915\u094D\u0932
  kla. (Note that on some fonts display this as \u0915\u094D followed by \u0932, rather
  than forming a conjunct. This expedient is used by ISCII and South Asian scripts
  of Unicode.) Thus a closed syllable such as kal requires two <strong>aksharas</strong>
  to write.</cite>\r\n\r\nDoes that mean that the Devanagari  \u0915\u094D\u0932  kla
  is formed by one akshara and  \u0915\u0932\u094D  kal requires two aksharas ?"

    or Unicode, excepting either absence of smart font layout handling or absence
    of particular conjunct ligature or half-form sequence. ISCII and Unicode use the
    halant as a conjunct forming control character, applied during e.g. OpenType Layout;
    this differs from some earlier systems that had a dedicated 'conjunct key', which
    might explain the confusion in the Wikipedia article.\r\n_____\r\n\r\nAs I recall,
    the term akshara can mean simply syllable or may refer to each individual combination
    of letter plus vowel or halant. Because of this varying usage, I've never found
    it a very useful term.\r\n\r\nAdding further confusion, when talking about Indian
    writing the term syllable is sometimes used to refer to a grapheme cluster, which
    may not correspond to a linguistic syllable. "

    the Indic syllables in this case would be these:\r\n\r\n<strong>ta- ttva - ma
    - si</strong>\r\n\r\nI have deliberately drawn this example from the English-language
    book \"Goldman/Sutherland, Introduction to Sanskrit\", 1987, page 16 (section
    2.23), so that English speakers may consult this English book in a library, if
    they want to learn more about Indic syllables.\r\n\r\nAn Indic syllable may be
    defined in a technically simplified way as:\r\n\r\n(1) a single vowel at the beginning
    of a word (e.g. \"a\" of \"a-gni\" = fire), or\r\n(2a) a single consonant (e.g.
    \"t\") or\r\n(2b) a consonantal cluster (e.g. \"ttv\"), followed by a vowel.\r\n\r\nFurther
    technical details, e.g. concerning visarga and anusvara, are omitted here.\r\n\r\nIn

    because there does not exist a Sanskrit word ending in \"b\" in pausa.\r\n\r\n(\"in
    pausa\" (Latin) means as the last word of a sentence or line, where you make a
    pause while speaking.)\r\n\r\nEven if a word ended in a soft \"b\" in Sanskrit

    root and not a declined noun), the soft \"b\" would be converted to hard \"p\"
    in pausa.\r\n\r\nPS: The word \"impossible\" should not be used in conjunction
    with an ancient language, because it is \"impossible\" to create \"new ancient\"
    texts. It is better to say: \"bn\" does not occur in the ancient Sanskrit texts,
    instead of saying: \"bn\" is impossible in ancient Sanskrit texts, because there
