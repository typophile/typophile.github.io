  for a game with themes of retro laundrettes/laundromats. It's worked up from sketches
  into illustrator, but I haven't been able to put the amount of time I would of like
  to at the moment. Anything would be great! \r\n\r\nM.\r\n"

    Type-ID Board ;)

  body: "Would you elaborate on the use for this? Size it will appear? Feeling you're
    trying to convey?\r\n\r\nThe 'retro' idea is coming across, for sure. Some nice
    curves in there too. \r\n\r\nYou could get better legibility from your r if you
    gave it a little more thick/thin contrast.\r\n\r\nThe -lab- doesn't have as much
    sense of a continuous pen stroke as the rest\u2014that could be ok.\r\n\r\nOverall
    the strokes might benefit from standardizing their angle and weight, and the rhythm
    between them. Or you could go the opposite direction and push the hand-drawn quality,
    maybe by accentuating the different heights of the ascenders."
