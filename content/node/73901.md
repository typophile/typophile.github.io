body: I am trying out fonts.com web fonts beta and was trying to find a font similar
  to Avenir. I think that I have narrowed it down to Metro Office, Neuzeit office
  (both of which are designed for the computer screen) and Neuzeit S; however, I was
  hoping for a better opinion than mine to determine which would be best. Any suggestions?

  body: It is for text and display. Thanks for the suggestions at Fontspring and Typekit
    but between those indicated in the initial thread starter would be closer to Avenir?

  body: "Metro is closer (Neuzeit is more of a grotesque/geometric hybrid \u2014 see
    Graphik), but you have to keep in mind the level of hinting put into these fonts
    if you\u2019re going to use them at text sizes on the web. A lot of users still
    see fonts rendered with Microsoft\u2019s grayscale renderer, and almost none of
    the newly @font-face licensed fonts hold up under those conditions. Another issue
    to consider is how similar things start to look at smaller sizes in low resolution.
    The most important characteristic of Avenir as low res text is it\u2019s low x-height.
    My advice is: look for that first."

    and <a href=\"http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/14-raleway\">Raleway</a>
    are two free, but limited, alternatives. I am, by now, pretty sure that <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/43643\">LuzSans</a>
    (see link at the end of the thread) is also free (and actually GPL'ed), so that
    may be another option?"

  body: "I apologize for such a late reply. Thank you all for all your suggestions
    I became interesting in the fonts.com beta after reading [[http://webfonts.info/wiki/index.php?title=Web_Fonts_(Monotype)|this]]
    page I figured I would try it out. Other fonts are supposed to be available later,
    but the initial 2,000 consisted of a select few geometric fonts. And based on
    what was offered I wanted some clarification of what would be a good alternative
    to Avenir based on the choices I had.\r\n\r\nI understand I could go try the other
    services that are offering fonts for websites to use, but I figured I would just
    try this one out. \r\n\r\nThanks once again for all the suggestions.\r\n\r\n@frode
    frank\r\nBy the way why do you say Metro Office looks closer?"

    A lot of details are bound to differ. The Neuzeit versions you mentioned are both
    rather grotesque in the proportions. '
