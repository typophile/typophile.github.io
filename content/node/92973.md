  the seventies I have. These are mostly cheapo easy-listening or kids' LPs, but I've
  also seen the font on late 70s soul and funk albums. \r\n\r\nAny help appreciated.
  Thanks!"

    to have been used quite frequently in the 70s, so I'm very surprised that I've
    not yet been able to identify it at all. \r\n\r\nAny other ideas anyone? I need
    to get hold of these asap for an album sleeve... "

    most likely looking at a phototypesetting face, which may or may not have been
    digitized.\r\n\r\nA likely candidate is various weights of Photo-Lettering Inc.\u2019s
    <strong>Republic</strong>. House Industries bought PLINC\u2019s entire collection,
    and they offer <em>some</em> of the faces online, based on the old pay-per-headline
    model. Last time I checked, Republic wasn\u2019t one of their offerings, but things
    change\u2026"
