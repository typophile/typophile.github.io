  idea of that Flag?

  body: Hovering over the "Flag" link with your cursor says "Notify the administrators
    this posting is problematic," so I think it's a way of tattling on spammers and/or
    jerks.

    no <em>or</em> about it.\r\n\r\nSo is it me that decides who my buddies are? Or
    them? I can't see a 'refuse to be buddy' button. Not that I'm antisocial...\r\n\r\nWhen
    you hit 'Flag' do you get a chance to explain why you think the post is 'problematic'?
    And if you get flagged, do you get a black mark, three strikes, that kind of thing?\r\n\r\n"
