body: okay, i decided that the easiest and least confusing thing to do would be to
  just give this one its own thread. again, it's not an ID, I'm just wondering if
  this has been digitized. If any of you feel that there's a better place for requests
  just as this, let me know where I should be posting. I just thought that people
  who check the ID boards probably have the best idea of whether there is a digital
  version of these things. But without further ado... Here's Inland Printers' version
  of Commercial Script, something quite different than the version you're all probably
  so used to seeing.

  body: "Paul\r\n\r\nThe little logo in the pic says Inland Type Foundry. Inland Printer
    was a trade journal. Inland Type was absorbed by the ATF conglomerate in 1912.
    So Commercial Script would either have shown up in early ATF specimen catalogs
    (and later dropped) or its matrices/punches were destroyed as a consequence of
    the acquisition. The later ATF version (designed by Bennett I think), nor any
    of the versions that have been subsequently digitized, that I have seen, don't
    look like this design.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: how very odd... i just edited my initial post and saw that the image had attached,
    but it wasn't showing, so i reset the setting. now you can see the sample in two
    places. ;^D

  body: "Now that I see the sample, it doesn't look like anything I have seen or collected
    Paul. The Inland/ATF connection was the reason I used the McGrew book's ATF 'Commercial
    Script' when I suggested the one sold by Monotype. \r\n\r\nThe sample you posted
    looks like some of the Photo-Lettering Spencerian Scripts (if that's the right
    term). There are several by M. M. Davison that look very close to this, but the
    Photo-Lettering catalogs only show partial samples. In any case, they would only
    have been 'inspired' by this style, since his work was much more recent. \r\n\r\nUntil
    House does something with these, they are not likely to see digital format any
    time soon. Pity.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: well part of the reason i wanted to find out about this one was to see if
    it was worth my time digitizing... and since i spent a good part of yesterday
    on it, i wanted to know if it's already been done.
