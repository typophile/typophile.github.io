  cleaned up the letters [img:sites/default/files/old-images/_UnknownNarrowSerifSM3_4770.jpg]and
  sent them to What The Font. Its closest suggestion was Bob Alonso's Fashion Didot

  \r\n\r\nClose, but not a match.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks Don"

  body: "Thank you. This is indeed an exact match. \r\nAccording to the note for the
    OPTI font it was \"Originally a phototype by Filmotype.\"\r\nUnless there was
    a version with the same digital outlines by another fontmaker before OPTI produced
    OPTI Racer, this is presumably an original digital creation by OPTI.\r\nDoes anyone
    know of a matching digital font before the OPTI font?\r\nI only ask because of
    of the notorious reputation of OPTI/Castcraft as a forger of unauthorized clones
    of digital fonts. A relatively small proportion of its fonts were original digital
    creations.\r\nDon\r\n"

    was originally Filmotype Racer. I know of no other digital versions.\r\n\r\nStuart
    Sandler bought the rights to the <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/foundry/Filmotype/'
    target='_blank'>Filmotype collection</a> in 2006 and has since been having several
    fontmakers create digital versions <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/filmotype/?PREFS_SET[ipp]=96'

  body: "Thanks Mike for the confirmation that the OPTI Racer is indeed based on a
    Filmotype font with the name of Racer.\r\nAs far as the fonts being created by
    Stuart Sandler's people from the Filmotype archives, I trust you will agree that
    the current rate of production is very slow -- only six fonts were released in
    2014. https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Filmotype/?sort=new \r\nDon"

  body: "I certainly would agree, Don. And the 69 fonts digitized thus far make it
    clear that nobody is racing to produce the more generic sans or serifs.\r\n\r\nI
    was just wanting to clarify for anyone accessing this thread in the future and
    wanting to use a font like this commercially that Filmotype isn't defunct; the
    legitimate rights belong to Stuart Sandler.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I appreciate the
    fact that Sandler and colleagues are including the batch of alternates that most
    Filmotype fonts had."

  body: "Mike, looking at the example of Racer, we have a design that Oxford University
    Press choose as the best way of expressing its title theme. I don't know whether
    OUP used the OPTI digital or a Filmotype analog source. \r\n\r\nI find the Racer
    typeface design superior to Fashion Didot for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAnyone trying
    something similar for a commercial project today would be stuck in the bind of
    using a digital font from OPTI -- an orphan foundry where there is no way of obtaining
    appropriate intellectual property permissions -- or making the font from scratch.\r\n\r\nI
    do hope that Stuart Sandler's digitization plan has Racer in the next batch.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
