  my problem.\r\n\r\nWhen using the measurement line in the FontLab preview panel
  it doesn't show right and left sidebearings in a certain typeface, (see pic 1).
  It is only showing the character width.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/measure1_6134.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhereas
  in pic 2 it is showing the r & l sidebearings, even though the settings appear to
  be the same.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/measure2_6677.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhy?
  have I accidentally pressed some command that I didn't realise? It is only doing
  this with one font and no others, even when I have lots of different ones open simultaneously
  and access them through the same preview panel.\r\n\r\nPs. Great invention BTW John
  - it comes in very useful, especially with serifs. \r\n\r\nI am grateful in advance
  of any help. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"

    measurement line snags but my guess, and it's only that, a guess, is that the
    overlapped/layered characters in your first example might be the problem. What
    happens if you delete some of the elements? Will the sidebearings show?"

  body: "Thanks for answering Eric. No, it's FLS5, there are no overlaps and it's
    all on the same layer.\r\n\r\nI can't really delete any of the elements because
    that would alter the look of the font. However, I tried removing some of the elements
    in the letter A so that it was a solid with just 29 points but it still didn't
    work.\r\n\r\nIt's not really essential that I have the measurement line - I just
    thought it peculiar that it didn't work on this particular style. Maybe there
    are too may points on the glyphs and it can't cope.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
