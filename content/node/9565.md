body: Hello <BR> <BR>OK, I deverse to get the piss taken out of me for this one, but
  any advice would be most useful. <BR> <BR>I have used Trajan for an identity project.
  The client loves it, all is good, except... <BR> <BR>Now I have come to set the
  companies stationery, there is no lowercase... can someone suggest a similar typeface
  with a lowercase? <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>===

  body: The only actual Trajan lower case attempted digitally &#40;and commencially
    available&#41; that I can think of is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/la-gioconda/">La
    Gioconda</a>. It&#39;s based on Giovanni Francesco Cresci&#39;s work, the first
    guy to break his head over this problem. Although La Gioconda was drawn by talented
    hands, I don&#39;t care for it as a lower case to Trajan. <BR> <BR>Can you show
    the logo? I think you&#39;ll want to stear way clear of things that &#42;look&#42;
    like trajan. Go for contrast instead. <BR> <BR>R

  body: 'Hmm, so this isn&#39;t exaclty taking my own advice. <BR>Try <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/testdriver/index.html">HTF
    Requiem</a>  <BR> <BR>Perhaps Berkley? <BR>Or maybe Electra? <BR> <BR>Comments
    on the logo: <BR>What will it look like at 1cm?  [box] ABERCROMBIES? <BR>The box
    seems a little off balance, though maybe for a reason. Maybe try the pattern with
    each spikey thing positioned the same way in it&#39;s box. Or ratating 90 degrees
    each time. <BR>Just thinking. <BR> <BR>Good luck!'
