body: "Legacy Gold (House Industries), comes in only one weight with no italics. Does
  anyone know a similar font that comes with a full complement of weights and italics?
  Unfortunately, I am having javascript errors on my end trying to upload the image
  file of the font. So if you want to help me out, you\u2019ll have to go the extra
  step of seeing what Legacy Gold looks like on your end. I\u2019ve never had a problem
  with the upload process before, so as a side issue, if anyone knows what I\u2019m
  doing wrong, let me know.\r\n\r\n"

    wanna try ITC Blair.\r\n\r\nOh and btw, you must mean Luxury Gold (not Legacy)."

  body: "Yes, I did mean Luxury Gold. Not the first mistake I made today. Thank you
    all for all the help. In terms of look, it\u2019s a trade off. It\u2019s either
    the wide width. Or the look and attitude of the characters without the width.
    Definitely need upper and lower case, so to make a long story even longer, for
    wide gothics, may use Sweet Sans or even Univers exteneds, or Helvetica Neue extended.
    For not-extened faces, I could use Neutraface or even Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nAndy"
