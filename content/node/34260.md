  body: My guess is it's a condensed version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/franklin-gothic/">Franklin
    Gothic</a> (the flared legs on the R). Then hand manipulated in Photoshop to give
    every character a unique look. This is definitely a custom job.

  body: "I think Crackhouse is a better guess, because the C is too closed to be Franklin
    Gothic. I was going to suggest <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/monotype_grotesque_extra_condensed/\">Monotype
    Grotesque Extra Condensed</a> that had been mutilated/eroded.It has the right
    R and the C is similarly closed.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I'll conceed. I will say, if in a pinch I'm sure you could achieve a similar
    effect with Franklin Gothic, or really any font if you're going to "corrupt" the
    look in Photoshop.

  body: "You're right Andrew, that you could make a pretty similar look starting with
    Franklin Gothic, but looking closely at Crackhouse in the FontBook I can see that
    very little had to be done to produce this sample. The deformities and fractures
    occur in the same spots and only minor distortions or modifications were necessary
    to create the 'CORRUPTION' lettering. I think Jan nailed it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
