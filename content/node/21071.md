  should we talk about?</a>\r\n\r\nAlso, in prepping for the discussion I came across
  an excellent <a href=\"http://www.creativetechs.com/tips/fontmanagement/index.html\">comparison

  body: "I don't use any Font Managers. This is because:\r\n\r\n1. My job does not
    require me to have many fonts installed;\r\n2. I work with Mac OS X, and \u2014
    unlike OS 9 \u2014 it allows me to keep the fonts inside of folders, which I can
    manage at my discretion;\r\n3. This way I know and have full control of which
    fonts are installed and where \u2014 made available to all the applications or
    just some;\r\n4. I'm a font developer and there are times when I need to generate
    and test tenths of fonts a day;\r\n5. It's easier to troubleshoot font problems
    because there's less font-cache issues to worry about.\r\n\r\nHaving said that,
    I find that a big part of the problems that people run into regarding fonts, are
    related with cache issues. Therefore, it would be interesting if Font Managers
    could supply documentation on this matter, and provide (to their users and people
    in general) easy and detailed methods on how to solve this problem. (I'm aware
    that Linotype FontExplorer X already does this to some extent.)"

    of doing so."

  body: "Font managers. Yikes!\r\n\r\nI keep all mine in folders, categorized by foundry.
    All my fonts are on CD as well, to keep them safe, and when I need one I just
    copy it from CD. I install/uninstall via FontBook, which is standard on OS X.
    Seems like the most sensible way to do things. \r\n\r\nEven when I used Windows,
    I only used a font manager (mainly Typograf) to verify kerning pairs and such.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure about the rest of us, but I find that font managers tend to cause more
    harm than good.   "

  body: "A big problem with testing fonts under development is that Mac OS X caches
    actual font data. When you activate an updated version of a font, either with
    a font manager or by placing it in a system font folder, you can't be certain
    that Mac OS has updated it's cache correctly. The only sure way is to clear the
    system caches, which requires a restart. I actually signed up for the font testing
    workshop at Typecon. I'm really excited to hear what professional font testers
    have to say.\r\n\r\nI think the font manager is a really useful piece of software
    for typesetters who use a lot of fonts. People who work in ad production for print
    or web may need to use a wide variety of typefaces because customers demand that
    their ad have a unique look and feel. Just to find a typeface in a certain class
    may involve looking at dozens of typefaces side by side. I suppose you could use
    the web based search tools, but many designers would prefer to restrict their
    previews to fonts they currently own and have readily available. Secondly if you
    have to go back and open old documents, its a real timesaver if the fonts simply
    turn on automatically. \r\n\r\nSome designers are fortunate enough to be able
    to use the same few fonts. Others aren't so lucky, usually because they are working
    in a market where customers demand novelty. \r\n\r\n"

    actually do with font files when one lets them manage. the first installation
    is always terrifying. apple's fontbook was the most destructive, in my case.\r\n\r\ni
    would also love to see manufacturers of designers' software tools taken to task
    for treating these applications as \"products,\" and rarely tools.\r\n\r\nin my
    mind, designers' applications are products only before the sale is made. they
    become tools once they're committed to. i want no sales presence in my working
    environment, with very little exception.\r\n\r\nthis means, for example, i don't
    want to be forced to deal with the linotype store (although that is one of the
    handier applications of sales presence in the work environment), and i don't want
    an accidental click on the useless logo bar in adobe's illustrator package to
    lead me to its product page. that particular move makes no sense whatsoever, and
    i've always resented it."

    added to the manager library, keeping your personal folder structure intact.

  body: "Two points:\r\n\r\nThe simple way to deal with Apple's \"flexibility\" regarding
    font folders is to pick one (either the one in your home folder or the one at
    the root of the start up drive) and stick with it. Don't install fonts anywhere
    else. Ever.\r\n\r\nThe simple way for font developers to avoid font cache problems
    is to always rename your font (Myfont A, Myfont B, Myfont C, etc.) when you generate
    a new version. It takes a little extra effort, but it has other benefits, including
    being able to have multiple versions of your font open at the same time for comparison,
    and it's much, much less hassle than cleaning the cache."

  body: "For font design purposes, I also rename work in progress adding a prefix
    or suffix to have a trail of work history. This is a whole new ballgame for graphic
    design use where you need a big range of fonts available for production.  I also
    wish utility developers would further demystify what happens when fonts are turned
    on and off or placed in sets.  I don't know who holds the key to the solution
    but what is out there now needs some help and collaboration between application
    software, design software, and font management software.  The trouble is that
    there is not a big chunk of change in font management software so developers don't
    want to put much resource into it.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
