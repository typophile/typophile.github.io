  posted. I'm more interested in the first two samples, but would like to know what
  Jubilee is resembled in. I'm assuming these are custom lettering, but if there's
  a commercial font closely looking like these I would appreciate some direction to
  the right place. Thank you. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/id-script-font_4567.jpg]"

  body: "_Oneline\xA9_ , according to a post on http://logopond.com/gallery/detail/135264
    in 2011 is an unused proposal for an insurance company logo by a Polish graphic
    studio Fajne Ch\u0142opaki http://www.fajnechlopaki.com/ [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Oneline_3900.jpg]
    The word _Online\xA9_ is subtitled _UBEZPIECZENIA_ which means \"insurance\" in
    Polish. Don't know if the script is an original by the studio, or whether it is
    a Polish adaptation of an existing logo.\r\n\r\nIn any case it's probably handlettered.
    Note the differences in the repeating letters.\r\n\r\nThe bouncing lowercase has
    some similarity to Mistral, but is not monoline [img:sites/default/files/old-images/MistralInUse_5645.jpg]

  body: "Ryuk, thanks for your help, it's always good to hear from you. I'm looking
    into Suomi Hand Script as it is very fitting for the project I'm working on. \r\n\r\nDon,
    thank you for the information and the links. Shelby and Amplia caught my eye and
    I'm looking into those fonts as well as Suomi Hand Script. They have a nice flow
    and are great for what I'm working on. \r\n\r\nThanks again!"
