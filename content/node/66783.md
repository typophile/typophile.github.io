  title=\"Google blog post about Unicode\">now has the reading abilities of a teenager</a>
  and can read <cite>f</cite>-ligatures: \u201C[T]he characters <cite>fi</cite> can...
  be represented as two characters (<cite>f</cite> and <cite>i</cite>) or a special
  display form <cite>\uFB01</cite>. A Google search for [financials] or [office] used
  to not see these as equivalent \u2013 to the software they would just look like
  *nancials and of*ce. There are thousands of characters like this, and they occur
  in surprisingly many pages on the Web, especially generated PDF documents. But no
  longer \u2013 after extensive testing, we just recently turned on support for these
  and thousands of other characters,\u201D ostensibly including hieroglyphs."
