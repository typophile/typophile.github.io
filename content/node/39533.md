  Courier and Helvetica fonts not working under Mac OS X Leopard and the Keynote presentation
  software. I wonder if this happens in other situations.

    knows, and really who cares? '

    I would have used some hilarious feline pun in the headline to link Tiger, Leopard
    and \"<STRONG>cat</STRONG>astrophic\" - although maybe the users who lost all
    their \"music and videos\" might not appreciate the joke. \r\n\r\nAnd why is it
    music and videos that are lost forever - are spreadsheets, documents, and porn
    not important to the average Mac user? :-)  \r\n"

  body: "I'm sorry to hear that Apple employs such poor technicians at their 'Genius
    Bar'. There are at least two solutions for the problem that allow users to salvage
    their data -- and that without taking the screwdriver in your hand. \r\n\r\nOne
    is to attach an external Firewire drive to the Mac, boot it from the system DVD,
    install Mac OS X on the external Firewire drive, boot from it and the copy all
    the data from the internal hard drive to the external one. The other one is to
    hook up the Mac to another Mac using a Firewire cable and boot your Mac in the
    target mode (pressing the T key while booting). This will allow the other Mac
    to recognize your Mac's internal hard drive as an external drive, so you'll be
    able to copy all your data from your Mac to the other one. \r\n\r\nThese solutions
    are known since Classic times, and I'm quite familiar with them, being a recent
    Mac switcher myself (the main reason I switched to Mac OS X was Windows Vista).
    If the 'Mac geniuses' at the Apple store did not suggest any of those simple solutions,
    well, shame on them. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n"
