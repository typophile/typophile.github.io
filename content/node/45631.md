  body: Maybe now, but oldstyle could be part of the modern trend of combining common
    word pairs into one. Does anyone say "web site" anymore?

  body: "I think that moving to one word makes sense. It fits with the OED trend toward
    turning common hyphenates and phrases into compound words, and it clarifies things
    for non-typographers, who may think old-style just means \u201Cin an older style\u201D."

    be "lowercase" . . .

  body: I think Charles is right. Oldstyle really isn't relevant anymore as a description
    of figures meant for lowercase letters. "Text figures" is my preferred term.

  body: There is nothing wrong with either text or oldstyle to contrast with lining.
    It's just terminology. (When you are a kid, you also have to memorize that cold
    /kold/ is the antonym of hot /hot/, and there is no obvious relationship between
    the two terms...)

  body: "Ciao,\r\nWhether the two words are concatenated or you \"keep em separated\",
    at different times thruout history \"old style\" has been used to refer to so-called
    \"hanging\" figures as well as the typeface designs (styles) of men such as Francesco
    Griffo and Nicolas Jenson. From the potted history I wrote for Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n<em>In
    Italy the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by Venetian or \"old style\"
    Latin types, also called antiqua.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The name \"roman\" is customarily
    applied uncapitalized to distinguish early Jenson and Aldine-derived types from
    classical Roman letters of antiquity. Some parts of Europe call roman \"antiqua\"
    from its connection with the humanistic \"lettera antica\"; \"medieval\" and \"old-style\"
    are also employed to indicate roman types dating from the late 15th century, especially
    those used by Aldus Manutius (Italian: Manuzio). Roman faces based on those of
    Speyer and Jenson are also called Venetian.\r\n\r\nSee also: Incunabulum</em>\r\n\r\nI
    think lettera antica and Venetian are better terms for the type style formerly
    known as \"old style\".\r\n\r\nAs for 'old style' numerals: \r\n<strong>text</strong>
    no, that could mean several different things\r\n<strong>old-style</strong> no,
    anachronistic & outmoded, the game has moved on\r\n<strong>lower case</strong>
    no, I can think of more telling nomenclature than that.\r\n\r\n<strong>x-body</strong>
    because these figures have x-height bodies. Some have extenders, and some, such
    as 1 and 2, are x-body only.\r\n\r\nCiao,\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "The problem with the term \"text\" is that is is just as opaque as the term
    \"oldstyle.\" If you use full caps in text, as some constructions seem to require,
    you should use lining figures. Whether or not one should ever use full caps in
    text is a different matter, but some editorial styles require it. And on balance
    (for instance), I think newspaper sections with page numbers (e.g., C2) do require
    full caps.\r\n\r\nIn any event, the advantage to \"lowercase\" and \"uppercase\"
    as terms is they do somewhat refer to what figures should be used in what contexts.\r\n\r\nHaving
    said that, I'm with Will. In informal conversations, I confess to still using
    the term \"oldstyle.\" "
