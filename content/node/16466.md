  of Switzerland. It has a rich history in typographic education. Teachers like Jan
  Tschichold, Emil Ruder, Armin Hoffman and Wolfgang Weingart were instrumental in
  making this school a center for modernist typography and education. The Vorkurs
  (foundation year) is still unique in it's very thorough examination of cross discipline
  basics following the Bauhaus methods.\r\n\r\nThe SfG has 270 full time students
  and the public courses are visited by over 1000 participants every year. The <a

  three week study of typographic basics.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.sfgbasel.ch/\">www.sfgbasel.ch</a>"
