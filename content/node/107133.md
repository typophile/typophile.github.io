  body: "\"Published by Orion\" and other bits use Olympia. The only digital version
    I'm aware of is Olympian by Dan Solo on the 24 Victorian Display Fonts CD. It
    used to be made and sold by Dover Publications, but they quit offering it a few
    years ago. Copies can still be found on Amazon and eBay.\r\n\r\nEdit: I forgot
    that Olympian can be had also as <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/rochambeau/'
    target='_blank'>Rochambeau</a> by Scriptorium."

  body: "Olympian: In addition to Dan X. Solo's Victorian Olympian, and Scriptorium's
    Rochambeau, there is Enstep's Dark Grey, which may be an independent digitization,
    but in any case is now an orphan font available only from pirate sites. Worth
    checking the three for relative quality.\r\nDon"
