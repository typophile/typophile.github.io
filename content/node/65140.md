  I posted a logo for a youth magazine. The logo eventually got turned down, but I
  felt the idea for the letterforms were to good to abandon and started sketching
  out a full typeface. The structure is inspired by cursive designes, something I
  believe must have been the idea behind Lucas de Groot\u2019s The Mix \u2014 as I
  found the serif placement of his design very similar to mine. This structure sometimes
  seem to interlock letterforms perfectly \u2013 other times make a mess out of the
  spacing. I\u2019ve not yet drawn the alternate glyphs I have in mind (cutting down,
  or cutting off serifs), as I want some good opinions on the basic alphabet. The
  typeface is intended for display use.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d love your criticism.\r\n\r\nEdits:

    out in the upper case. Why not on G? I'd rather do without them.\r\n- The upper
    left stroke end on lowercase x: what about a slant?\r\n- l, m, n end in a thinner
    stroke - sugg: more like k\r\n- I'd prefer the slant in the lowercase serif more

    I notice you've slanted the \"el\" slightly (presumably to prevent it from tipping

    The font is sitting too high (descenders way too long compared to the ascenders).\r\n\r\n-
    The \"s\" is very nice!\r\n- To me the \"x\" is too much, but maybe it's OK since
    it's infrequent.\r\n- I'd make the join in the \"k\" thinner.\r\n- I'd make the
    middle part of the \"w\" not curl. Or maybe just gently.\r\n- The \"C\" is a bit

    Helvetica, Droid Sans) shows what I think of as \"normal\" M-shape: true verticals
    on the left and right, and all strokes bottom out at the baseline. This can lead
    to cramped looking counters left and right compared to the upper, V-shaped counter
    in the middle.\r\n\r\nOne solution that some fonts take is (2: Optima, Myriad)
    to splay the side strokes, so that instead of being vertical they angle out, evening
    out the counter areas.\r\n\r\nAnother solution to the problem, seen in (3: Gill
    Sans, Tahoma), is to raise the center vertex, which also opens up the top angles.\r\n\r\nYour
    M does both. There's no rule against this of course, but I wonder if one or the
    other of these accomodations would look better than having both. "

    lengths \u2013 it's the first thing that struck me as odd.\r\n\r\nNot sure about
    the shears everywhere (especially when they're on the baseline, or at the apex).
    I think you might need more rules to govern them. Like, you usually don't have
    them on straight stems, so why on the exclam? And the stems of the \"M\" \u2013
    but not the top, where it would be logical compared to the \"W\"?\r\nAlso, consider
    making the angles [more] consistent. For instance the different angles on the
    2 arms of the \"F\" give me an unhappy, almost 3-D effect. But maybe that's just
    me. \r\n\r\n*Love*: \"v\", \"y\".\r\n\"w\" seems a bit much. (Compare the \"m\"
    where the middle \"foot\" is \"normal\".)\r\nHave you tried making the \"x\" \"dance\"
    in the other direction? It looks funny next to the \"y\". Also, at least the \"x\"
    and \"k\" look like they're ever-so-slightly leaning backwards.\r\n\r\nEdit/add:
    Considering how much funky stuff you're doing, I think you should really be entittled
    (sorry) to keep the large tittles. :) Maybe raise them a little though? But that'd
    be easier to tell in context."

    agree with Craig about the s. The counters of c and a are quite open at the top
    and s seems to loop a bit far round by comparison: try lifting its head up more
    horizontal? Same for S I think.\r\n\r\nI like the funky stuff going on here, like
    Nina said. I'd make that serif on C a bit chunkier, also on S. What about vertical
    serifs?\r\n\r\nWhat about a head serif on f too?\r\n\r\nF looks a bit wide? G:
    Longer crossbar?\r\n\r\nCounters on B and K look a bit small: can the forms be
    widened? \r\n\r\nX: traps?\r\n\r\nZ: looks a bit left-leaning?\r\n\r\nq: foot

    (There's an /il/ and a couple of /ik/s in the text setting for examples.) I think
    that may pose a spacing problem.  If Nina gets her way and you keep the tittles
    this size (:-)), you may want to consider contextual alternates that reduce or

    font, nevermind a \xABplayful\xBB one, and I'm Swiss, so get a salt mine!). \r\nI
    just wonder if it wouldn't be good to have a little more of a system as opposed
    to deciding on the shear/angle on a case-by-case basis\u2026 It seems a bit random,
    and in places a bit contrived. Like, why is the apex of the \"A\" at an angle,
    but not the vertex of the \"V\"? OK, maybe you have shears only on top. Then what's
    up with the vertex of the \"M\"? And why do the stems of the \"M\" have slanted
    ends on the baseline, but not the legs of the \"A\", which seems like a sufficiently
    analog construction? \u2013 I keep trying to find a system and I keep failing.
    Makes me think there's probably just something I'm not getting. \r\nBut here's
    a thought \u2013 since you're apparently aiming for an alternate-rich font, how
    about having \xABstraight\xBB base forms, and stylistic alternates with all sorts
    of different shears, for individually adjustable levels of playfulness?\r\n\r\nBTW,
