  _only_ codepage Windows-1251 &#40;Cyrillic&#41;, i.e. has glyphs that cover only
  this codepage. Then, in the process of .otf compilation, the MakeOTF heuristics
  properly set the bits of ulCodePageRange1 to 0000......0100 &#40;bit 2 = Cyrillic&#41;,
  leaving ulCodePageRange2 zeroed. <BR> <BR>On an XP system &#40;atmfd.dll and atmlib.dll

  CS, because all the OpenType features &#40;including the kern one&#41; are completely
  inaccessible. <BR> <BR>Nevertheless, should bit 1 &#40;= Latin 2: Eastern Europe&#41;
  in ulCodePageRange1 be set to 1, the font works like a charm, regardless of whether
  bit 2 &#40;= Cyrillic&#41; is set or not. &#40;i.e. 0000......0110 and 0000......0010
