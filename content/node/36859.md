body: "I need to put together a NASCAR-style racing poster and, frankly, Serpentine
  is to me the obvious choice.  It's also cliche and pretty much played out IMO--I've
  never really liked it.  But nothing I'm working with really says \"Car Racing\"
  like Serpentine.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/serpentine/bold-oblique/\r\n\r\nWould
  love to use something that gives the general racing feel in the same way without
  using this particular typeface.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! "

    is not as overused, but both are dated. I like Jan''s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_trademarker/">FF
    Trademarker</a> suggestion. See also this thread: http://www.typophile.com/node/36574'
