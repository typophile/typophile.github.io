<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>A longstanding feature, the auction was dropped from TypeCon last year.
It involved serious logistics to organize, and despite the efforts of volunteers, the large overheads involved meant that it didn't always pay its way. To be a success, it was dependent on getting good donations, and spirited bidders.
TypeCon attendees -- did you miss it?
Are your bookshelves overflowing with typographic exotica you'd like to donate?
Would you rather acquire such stuff from the antiquarian bookseller at the conference, or does an auction's excitement, serendipity, and the prospect of an amazing bargain hold more allure?
Should we have an auction at Boston?

<div class=commentbody>Nick,
Since New York was my only TypeCon, I am not sure what the auction was about. It does sound like fun though and I do have a book to donate (brand new shrink-wrapped copy of "Dutch Type").

<div class=commentbody>"Should we have an auction at Boston?"
I think an auction is a good activity, but it does not seem a good match with the more...hardscrabble, blue collar, if you will, ideals of Typecon.
Can we have flea market, or Bazaar instead? Nothing over $40, mostly used...something more...quarrelsome.</div>

How about if we all have knock-off books pinned inside our raincoats and give attendees a chance at a quick deal bfore the bunko squad arrives :-)

<div class=commentbody>In NYC a few people dropped off auction items at the store, we priced them, added them to the inventory and the proceeds went to SoTA, only problem with this approach is what to do with things that don't sell. Really need someone to take them home and ebay them after the event. </div>

<div class=commentbody>My two cents...
Minnesota was my first TypeCon, and I thought the auction, hosted by Dave Farey and Chank, was great fun. San Francisco's auction didn't seem to pack as much punch, true, but I missed having it in New York. I would only have two or three items to donate if it was done in Boston.
My vote is YAY, bring it back this year!
Suggestion: maybe it could be done every other year, to let people miss it a bit, and to allow for several items to be collected.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>flea market, or Bazaar</em>
That would perhaps be too similar in format to the vendor's area.
The "bluecollar" items at SF were the things which dragged it down, many donations of, for instance, small specimen leaflets, ending up bundled together and bought sight-unseen.
But I hear what you're saying about the clientelle: I was bidding for an item at TypeCon Minneapolis and dropped out at a couple hundred $ (spousal limit imposed) -- the item went to the other guy for a steal. I later discovered that an acquaintance would have liked it for his university library, and would have paid thousands for it. So the trick is to get "the right product for the market". A donation of fifty 1923 ATF specimen books would work.</div>

That's one of the fun things about the auction... "If Nick is bidding on it, it must be worth having" or "That fuse collection will be broken up and on ebay by Monday" - few people have any idea of what things are worth, some stuff goes for a song, and other stuff is vastly over-bid, and most people have no idea.</div>
