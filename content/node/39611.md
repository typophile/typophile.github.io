  name it? (Purely by coincidence, the addition of two letters to the front of the
  name of the typeface makes it our company name.)\r\n\r\nNo doubt, I'll think of
  more questions later.\r\n\r\n(I've already contacted the foundry and await their

  body: With a custom typeface you can work out all of those details with the foundry.
    I'd guess it will come down to your budget.

  body: The only thing I would add is that Adobe has licensing terms that allow for
    customization by a 3rd party when you buy a given font through them. This can
    help sometimes.

    \r\n\r\nTypically you\u2019d pay a fee for the mods and then be able to use the
    font under the standard EULA terms that accompanied the un-modified font. \r\n\r\n>Can
    we distribute it conditionally to vendors? \r\n\r\nNegotiating such a right would
    be possible, but depending on the size of your operation and number of users/workstations
    that will need to have the font installed (on-site or off) it would probably be
    less expensive to \u201Ccount\u201D users and get enough licenses for everyone.
    \r\n\r\n>Can we name it? \r\n\r\nNaming can be tricky as renames can dilute the
    original font trademark. However appending the company name after the font name
    may be acceptable \u2013 for example \u201CNeo Sans Intel\u201D\r\n"

    \u2013 payable in advance :-) \r\n"
