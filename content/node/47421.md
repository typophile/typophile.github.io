  When I decided to renovate my grandmother house, one year after her death, I found
  old books, carefully aligned on a bookshelves. The oldest was printed in 1831 (I
  think that someone else in my family must have something older).\r\n\r\nAll the
  books dating back to the first half of XIX century are printed with some 'modern'
  faces, are very small (12/15 cm height) and don't look like masterpieces of typography.
  Nothing valuable, I suppose.\r\n\r\nWell, my 'project' is to make 'revivals' based
  on that historical (somewhat 'familiar') material. \r\n\r\nMy problem is that I
  know nothing about the design of typeface revivals (for example my text is in italian,
  I haven't k, y, x examples), etc. I think I need some advice.\r\n\r\nAnyway I started
  to observe one book printed in Venice in 1842 (an edition of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldassare_Castiglione\">Baldassarre
  Castiglione</a>, il Cortigiano) to do some sketches. \r\nThe name of the typographer
  and publisher is Girolamo Tasso. With a quick search in the database of the italian
  <a href=\"http://www.sbn.it/opacsbn/opac/iccu/informazioni.jsp\">National Library
  Service</a> I've found that he printed books from 1819.\r\nI noticed some peculiarity:\r\n1.
  the Q looks like the Q in Didot (well, the digital version of 'Didot' I've seen)
  but it hasn't the 'fineness' of Didot\r\n2. the second loop of the lowercase g seems
  open (particularly in the italic)\r\n3. the oldstyle numbers: 3,4 and 5 usually
  go below the baseline, here the opposite is true\r\n\r\nhere are images of the book:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/veneziagpagina_5391.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/veneziaQ_6119.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/veneziagtonde_5736.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/veneziagcorsiva_3722.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/veneziagtondagrande_6669.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/venezia59_6443.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/venezia-39_5056.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/venezia-49_3980.jpg]\r\n\r\nWell,
  second observation:\r\nLooking in another book, printed in Naples, 1831, I've found
  something very similar (open g, Q tail like in Didot, oldstyle numbers 3,4 and 5).\r\nThe
  typographer is Francesco Masi and he seems to have worked from 1826 (my research
  is 'unreliable')\r\n\r\nHere are the images of the Naples book\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/napoliQ_4795.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/napoliQ-grande_6741.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/napoli-g_5755.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/napoli-gpiccola_4718.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/napoli-4_6415.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/napoli-5_6340.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  just curious if someone can tell me something more about typefaces with similar
  features.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\ndaniele\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    be specific. \r\n\r\nThese definitely look like Didot (or in the \"school\" of
    Didot). The early Modern styles of Didot and Bodoni were very influenced by the
    work of Baskerville (ca. 1760s or so). I believe that's where the open lower loop
    of the 'g' is coming from. \r\n\r\nThe unusual alignment of the figures you mentioned
    is characteristic of the French style of this period -- sometimes called French
    oldstyle figures -- and can still be seen later in the early 20th century in some
    of the fonts from the Deberny & Peignot foundry.\r\n\r\nBut your samples look
    very similar to reproductions of work by the Didots that I've seen in Updike's
    <cite>Printing Types</cite>. \r\n\r\n-- Kent."
