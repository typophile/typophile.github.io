  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear typophiles,

I've been fiddling around quite a while with this (it started in type battle #12 or #14, if I can remember), and I think now it's the right time for some feedback whether you like it or not...

Please concentrate on a-z, A-Z and A.sc-Z.sc at the moment, all the figures and special characters are not very clean yet.

Even in the basic characters, there are some inconsistencies yet, where I'm not sure which direction I should go (see lowercase r or upper case Y for example). The Smallcaps are still quite dirty, especially the serifs.

There are 4 cuts at the moment:
roman book
roman titling
italic book
italic titling

Maybe there will be a semibold some time later, but this is just an idea. I don't know if it really fits, but it would give some more flexibility for typographers.

enough talking... chop it :)
Sebastian

		<div class="commentbody">I find the fading of the ampersand a little much, I like it, but I think I might close in the bottom gap just a hair or two more. Also on the 'sk', 'sp' and 'st' ligatures, there's a bit of a point sticking out that doesn't come down as smooth as it should.

There's a glitch or two in the PDF, but it doesn't seem to be part of the font, such a there's a negative knockout in the lowercase 'y' of the titling italic sample page.</div>

The italic 'a' seems to be at slightly the wrong angle.  It seems like it should tilt to the right just a tad more.

The shape of the italic 'w' bugs me a bit, although I'm having a hard time describing why. It's as if the right-hand curve is trying to decide whether to be just slanted or curved.

		<div class="commentbody">I don't see any reason why the eth shouldn't come up to full height. Is there a good one?

I know that before I knew a lot about fonts, I was distracted even by the fact that a lot of fonts have capitals shorter than their lowercase ascenders. I thought it was an amateur mistake, and distracting. I'm not suggesting you change that, obviously, because it looks good in almost any font, but I think if you leave the eth short like that, your Icelandic reading community is going to be distracted, and a good text font ought to be pretty much invisible to laymen.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have come back to this a few times. Something was bugging giving me pause but I wasn't sure what - especially since the forms are so nice when they are big. In the end I think I found all the lovely detail & character made the face noisy to me at small sizes. What you are doing for optical scale seems to be working as far as I can tell. Maybe making the intensity of character fade up with display sizes and lessen with text sizes would help me. Or maybe the detail/character needs to be more apparent and isn't just below some kind of threshold. I ma not sure which. 

What do you think of this? </div>
