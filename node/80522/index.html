  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello all. 

I'm having these printed this week and have finally settled on a design I enjoy, but I'd like another set of discerning eyes on it if possible! I do freelance, but I work in a number of fields, so I didn't want a card that played up one over the other. I also tend to write small notes to the people I exchange with, so having an airy card is important for that. So it basically became a matter of font selection. 

My inspiration were vintage cards from the 40's - 60's. Those 3 decades are obviously very different so I ended up narrowing my focus to a more late-50's/60's kind of look with ITC Blair and initially Futura which I swapped for Avenir.

Just curious if there are any glaring typographical problems with this design. Also, if you have any simple ideas for this kind of style I'd love to hear them. 

Thanks guys.

I’d adjust the tracking of creative professional to match the width of your name.

Copperplate Gothic would further the 1940’s reference.

		<div class="commentbody">A minimalist business card for a creative professional needs to sell minimalism. I suspect that you don't have a great grasp on minimalism if you think black+white and lots of white space is all it takes to be minimal. Right now your business card is selling a kid who doesn't know how to use his page layout software.

Your web site suggests that you're a very good photographer. Start over and design a business card to sell that. Even better, trade a graphic designer some photo work for an identity system that unifies your business card, web site, and the post cards that I suspect you send out about your photo work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Appreciate the input. 

I'm not sure if my card will ever be used to 'sell' me, but I completely get what you're saying. What about the design shows a lack of knowledge with page layout software? I've been using the Adobe suite since I was 9 (23 now, Father is a designer). I'm not taking that as an insult, but what decisions look amateurish? 

I do plan on redesigning my website (it is a stripped down Blogger template). I will be doing all the work myself even if it requires more than one (this) attempt. I have been freelancing for 3 years so I am more than capable. I really just hate cluttered cards. If someone meets me, they will remember my personality and my work, and I hope the card will just be a means of quick contact reference. 

Any suggestions beyond, "Give up, have someone else do it"? I really do appreciate the criticism. As I've outlined my objectives, are there any solutions that come to mind that would perhaps be more effective?</div>

"ZAZZ"? is not what you are looking for. You want something meaningful.  If you don't know yourself or your work well enough to come up with that, zazz can't help you--perhaps you need to look at yourself as a client.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Don't take it the wrong way, but the card looks rather dull. It <em>is</em> minimalistic, but it is forgettable. It lacks the A-HA moment. At the very least I'd consider alternative layouts. 

Without implying that these are any better, here are some options I sketched for my card some time ago:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/layouts_3715.png]

<code></code>

Perhaps look at two-sided (black/white) stock, or sandwiched stock. Or do a blind press of something on a back of the card. Or die-cut corners with a very small radius (1 mm or thereabouts). Or add a quirk to the actual card content, e.g. say you are a "professional creative"... Something to stand out. But in a subtle, minimalistic way :)

Also, I would advise against going with the letterpress. 

For one there's something called dot gain - an effect of finer details coming out far heavier and coarse than they are in the design. This can be accommodated of course, assuming the printer knows his stuff (Mandate Press, for example, does not). 

For two, the delicate appearance, which is frequently what one wants with a minimalist card, is not exactly compatible with the letter press. If you haven't done it already, go out and physically look at the finest possible letterpress you can find. Letterpress photos found online are <em>extremely</em> misleading. The shots are made from that exact angle that makes the piece looks great, but from other angles it may look crude and heavy. You can probably tell that I got burnt by this. So here's my $250 (+tax +s/h +sneaky-ups-charges) advise - do look at physical samples first.

Also, have a look at (intaglio) engraving as an alternative. The printed part has a texture similar to that of thermo print (which is said to be a poor's man engraving), but it allows for much finer detail. I did a run of white on black cards few years back and they came out really impressive (<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/37230902@N04/3429442086/sizes/l/in/photostream/>here is a close-up</a>).

Yet another option appears to be silk-screening, however I only saw a sample of a card made with it on Flickr (with a macro close-up) and it looked very precise. I asked around and that appears to be a European specialty. I couldn't find any silk-screener in Canada capable of reproducing that card.

Lastly, for the design inspiration swing by business card related groups on Flickr. There's plenty of junk there, but lots and lots of really good ones too.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all for your excellent input, it has really helped me along.

I will have to get an updated version uploaded once I get home, but for what it's worth, I fixed the kerning, the tracking, and the placement is all meticulously measured now. After a few trial inkjet prints I think I have the text size at an optimal point taking into account a little dot gain.

I removed "Tel" as well, as it didn't really make any sense in retrospect, and have gone with the +1 201 123 4567 advice. Looks much better. 

Also, Trevor, the font is Avenir... obviously a cousin of Futura but a little sexier IMO. Especially in the C, which is obviously important in this case. But I agree, I'm going with a cream paper tenatively.

I got a quote for $150 for 1000. 100% cotton 110lb./300g. How's that price?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Minimalism is about choosing the fewest pieces necessary and using them in the most considered possible way.

You put your name and title in the middle and the two other details in the corners. I agree that it is "templatey". You're spreading yourself out for no reason, and not creating a simple visual flow between the elements.

Try minimizing the "footprint" of your text. Group it, create a vertical axis that aligns them all. Paul Rand's card is classy because it is one font, in one weight, and he leads your eye down a single path. On that path you see things in the order he has chosen for you: name, address, telephone number. When your eye jumps to the left (because he breaks his vertical axis) it sees the company name, not something about him. See what I mean?

Minimalism is my favourite thing. When you reduce your card into its bare components, you have to be extra considerate about the fundamental properties: alignment, size, weight, contrast, etc.

Also, don't you need an email address? I think in today's market you could get away with a card that said: 

first.last@yourURLInADifferentWeight.com

...and nothing else. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are other aspects of minimalism too that you're missing out on. Again because it is just the barest elements, you need to get those elements exactly right.

The relative weights of the name and the title, for instance, feel off for me. The colour is too-uneven-or-not-uneven-enough, and the combination of the wide version of Avenir with the spaced-out regular emphasise precisely the differences between the two, when you're trying to achieve a cohesiveness.

But my major problem is the spacing, the rhythm. Pay super-good attention to the composition, the margins, the optical look of the placements in relation to each other. The two lines in the center really jar for me because the rhythm is almost, but not quite, a whole line of small-type while space between the two - it makes it feel cramped and stilted in a way nudging the type up or down wouldn't.

Cristopher Dean's granddad's card works well (besides the kerning issue) because the composition is so straightforward, with a clear top half and a coloured bottom half; because the typefaces gel better; and because the spacing is based on a much more thought-through, rigid grid.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you want to do minimalist, read Zen and the Art of Archery.  To many people minimalism is just things that are sparse, simple, or uncluttered. That is just a vague surface.  When you limit yourself to very few elements, each one and its relationship to the next is extremely and specifically important.  It is much easier to send a huge unabridged dictionary.  It is another to extract from it just the exact words to be a poem.  I think you must first ask yourself, "Are you REALLY a minimalist" or do you just admire that kind of work? If you are attempting to indicate to a client base that this is who you are, then truth in advertising would mean you had to actually be? If you truly are, then it will just happen when you work. It is not a snap-on aesthetic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I do really appreciate this discussion, it's nice to be around passionate individuals. 

A few points:

- I will definitely take all this into consideration before print. You guys will get a say in the final final. 

- I have a heavily "guided" layout so I will take another look to make sure everything is precise. It will drive me crazy if something is a little bit off and I have to look at it 1,000 times.

- Perhaps my use of minimalist was a bit self-indulgent. My work actually isn't minimal at all, but I wanted my card to be a sort of anti-thesis to the dirtiness and grime that works it's way into some of my stuff. There is also a bit of cheekiness with regard to the "Wile E. Coyote / Patrick Bateman" type card. A theme I often work with is "low brow in a high brow way". So this is kind of my way of packaging myself in that classic, 'high brow' way, while demonstrating with my work that I'm capable of photographing someone vomiting. (For an extreme example...)

- If I change the layout more significantly than properly spacing everything, I'm not sure the card would still have that classic print shop vibe about it, and might look too, "Oh, yes, I'm a designer. Check out how right-justified all this shit is." That being said, I will definitely play around...

- Keeping in mind my early-60's / Public School sort of thing, is there a font any of you might suggest that would "gel" better with Avenir than ITC Blair? 

Thanks again. I look forward to hearing any further ideas.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">We're happy to work with your very fine lines and type at Slow Print Letterpress.
See http://www.slowprint.com/portfolio/letterpress-samples/P9240044.jpg for example
Of course this was on expensive Copperplate Etching paper, which takes light inking perfectly.

I'm a big fan of minimal inking on the press, and micrometer roller settings.

Unfortunately, many designers expect letterpress to have the depression of a 35 ton weight (we can do that, but we don't like to) AND the density of 6-color litho AND the texture in the stock of a wool blanket.

Assuming the designer/client understands the letterpress process, we will produce exceedingly fine impressions.

Basic equation:  more texture in the stock =  more ink to get solids

Therefore, if we prefer less ink (which we do) we must accept less solid coverage on textured stock. 

For type on white-ish stock, this is generally not a big problem, since even low coverage will be plenty for typical caption sized type. However, on larger sizes, there will be EITHER too much ink, or less than 'perfect' coverage.

For those who understand, we will double-hit the larger solids, cutting away the small type from the form (this is photopolymer, of course) and running the sheets back through the Windmill to lay a second layer of ink in the larger areas. The Heidelberg Windmill is capable of pinpoint perfect registration. This technique was used with silver ink on black stock in this card: http://slowprint.com/sources/PC160082.jpg 
Everything but the "Projekt, Inc." was cut away from the form and then the sheets were run a second time. There's a tiny bit of ink creep on the second impression in order to  cover. But the fine type is... fine, no?

For those who don't understand and want them cheap and fast, there are plenty of other letterpress printers out there.

Cheers!

Peter

Do you double-hit all large solids? Or do you just make a separate pass with a lower ink and packing for the small type? Years ago when letterpress was more the norm, I had difficulty with large solids--mostly with reversed finer lines.  Sometimes I would make a fine-line only outline impression that worked like a holding line.  I would then come back with the large solids and used the fine line pass as trapping.  Things are WAY easier now ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Chris, er, @dezcom...

I don't double-hit all large solids. Lower contrast between the ink color and substrate will of course make this unnecessary. Also, it depends enormously on the stock itself.
The smoother the stock the less it's necessary. Also if I'm running on the Miehle Cylinder, it's possible to get better coverage (although the same equation still applies) due to the moving impression rather than the instant pressure of the platen.

Regarding running two forms, it's far easier, given the perfect registration possible on the Windmill, to just run it through a second time after removing the lighter stuff from the plate (one reason I prefer plastic-backed polymer over the steel stuff!). Don't need to re-register to a second form, etc.

The 'trapping' technique is still a good one, of course, but the main thing is trying to educate people to respect their materials and to understand the 'mechanickal art' in the process. I love the look of slightly under-inked type - because I see letters as individuals (as a type designer). Really, to me it's perfect if it's slightly under-inked. When printed on dampened stock, the coverage simply can not be better! See my Rudolf Koch piece.* 

But a graphic designer wants (reasonably) the whole piece to have visual power, which often means the subtle crispness of perfect inking must be slightly compromised to gain density. (on a textured stock, that is. On coated stock, it's all sharp and gorgeous and dense. But who wants a deep impression on coated stock? Yuck.)

* http://typophile.com/node/66350 ("Pace" Hrant, I know we disagree on the depth of the impression, which on dampened stock is quite acceptable ;-)

All avenir this time. I noticed though if I change the layout of the original card though it has a whole different feel. Definitely loses a lot of that vintage vibe and just becomes a 'modern' feeling card.

Your spacing is a mess, and especially in that last line where there's no logical grouping of things except a slightly heavier weight on the website (which looks more like a mistake and throws off the balance). You need to consider contrast, spacing, kerning, horizontal rythm, logical grouping, optical alignment, balance etc and those diagonal lines and the type should echo each other somehow. As others have pointed out before: this is not minimalism, it's just few elements. I'd be happy to help you out with this (and so would probably the rest of us), but not for free.</div>

Your site shows a strong interest in photography. Have you considered putting a photo on the card? Here are a couple of examples I found to illustrate the general idea. You might even do a series with a different image on each one.

Just moving the type around is just (ok, just once) rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic (Sorry ;-) unless you are <em>using the type to arrange the white space</em>.

<code>The space between the chunks is far&nbsp;&nbsp;too&nbsp;&nbsp;obvious&nbsp;&nbsp;in my view. &nbsp; We don't&nbsp;&nbsp;speak&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;big&nbsp;&nbsp;pauses, eh?</code>

When you start seeing the relationships of the white space, things like optical centering and alignment become simple. Painfully obvious, in fact ;-)

I personally think NeXT logo is awful (and the 30+ page manuscript that explains why the box needs to be turned 28 (?) degrees is just full of itself).

In fact, I don't know a single person who actually used NeXT machines and liked the logo. NeXTs were truly incredible for their time and the logo did not do them <em>any</em> justice whatsoever. It looked foreign, like something hastily slapped on a otherwise exceptionally polished and elegant piece of computer machinery.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, I did see and play with a few NeXT workstations both at trade shows and in use.  I never owned one, too much money, but I sure loved Display PostScript and true Unix multitasking! My use of the machines was all in the design/publishing arena so the apps I saw were limited to a specific arena. It was like I have always coveted a Porsche 911 or even the old Speedster but knew it was only a dream to ever get one. The Unix workstation never came down to the price range of what people were willing t pay for the competitive DTP market.  Microsoft saw Unix as more of a threat to the straight business market outside of engineering and science and Apple's new leader  sure was not going to jump in and help his old boss prove he was smarter after all.  Steve Jobs did his usual brilliant job of hype at publishing conferences--I saw him at Seybold a few times and was impressed.

I might also ask if you have much direct experience working for large organizations or corporations and getting agreement on corporate identity materials?  Rand was a master of this but even he knew when a done deal was a done deal by the boardroom Brooks Bros suit guys.  Rand always made a very logical and thought out book to present a logo.  After seeing his books for IBM, Westinghouse, and even his wayward attempt with Ford Motors, I can't imagine any remote chance of the usual flippant, ad jockey whipped out quickie being even a conversation with him.  Jobs loved Rand and what he stood for as a designer.  rand was surprised to get the call from such a young gun like Steve but was glad to go beyond the mammoth IBM mega-bureaucracy in the high-tech market.
I am sure we can differ on our opinion of what landed on the cube but you have to give Rand the credit he is due for creation of the corporate identity as a must for any operation worth its salt.</div>
