  I&#39;ve just discovered it has no en dash. It seems to me I have two options: simply
  use a hyphen instead &#40;ugh&#41; or borrow the en dash of another typeface. Any
  font seemed to work fine. Since I am not a typographer I figure those are my only
  two options. Am I right?'

  body: Solved the mystery.  I was also keen to save $2 on my font purchase ... so
    I opted for the URW&#43;&#43; version over the Linotype version. Not only does
    Linotype have an en-dash, it has the cute cursive lowercase &#34;s&#34; and URW
    doesn&#39;t have that, either.
