  body: "hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI'm the co-founder and former Creative Director of Rapha.
    I designed the logo in 2004 and then worked on final refinements with Nick. I
    created the concept, got the design about 95% of the way there, and then Nick
    added some beautiful touches: the overall authentic 'signature-like' realism and
    the lovely indent in the cap 'R'.\r\n\r\nThe letterforms were originally based
    on commercial hand-lettering that I found on the side of a 1950s (-ish) Citroen
    H-Van support vehicle in a French book about the Tour de France. The distinctive
    open shape of the 'p' was the first thing I really liked about it, although the
    original 'p' had a rather nasty squared off descender, which we rounded off to
    create a more 'ink-like' appearance.\r\n\r\nI can't remember what the original
    lettering read (I'm still trying to find a copy of the original picture), although
    it did have the descender/ascender relationship of the final logo, but didn't
    include an 'R' or an 'h', which I drew from scratch.\r\n\r\nThe logo is paired
    with Trade Gothic, which was also inspired by the H-van... a lot of European commercial
    graphics of that period had the 'signature + condensed sans' combination. Despite
    the fact that it's actually an American typeface it just seemed to fit the slightly
    nostalgic '1950s European supermarket graphics' feel I was aiming for, whilst
    also being very functional.\r\n\r\nI came up with the phrase 'Performance Roadwear'
    as a placeholder - something to balance the logo. It just sounded like a slightly
    pompous piece of marketing copy, the sort of thing a European sportswear brand
    would use. Looking back on it though, it was really important as it immediately
    established both our technical credentials and also our focus on road cycling.
    Often those instinctive things do actually hold up intellectually.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    one of the reasons we originally chose the name Rapha was for the way it looked
    in a script. I did a few mock-ups of various possible brand names and 'Rapha'
    just looked good, even in crappy standard Edwardian Script type stuff. Rare perhaps
    to choose the name based on how it looked, but satisfying for someone with a background
    in design.\r\n\r\nNick did an amazing job at refining the concept and turning
    it from a good piece of work into a great piece of work, thanks Nick.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nLuke
