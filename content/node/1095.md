    yum. <BR> <BR>however, I hope the blue and pink isin&#39;t meant for boys and
    girls - cause that&#39;s going a bit too cute. the design could be cleaned up
    some - the detail of it shows alot of areas where line work could be touched up
    - as well as perhaps spelling it correctly.  <BR> <BR>personally though I&#39;m
    looking forward to seeing the more witty ones that have some kind of original
    concept to them. &#40;nudge nudge, and not the &#34;rip off concepts&#34; we argued

    joke about the economy. I mean, subtlety is good if it amplifies the value of
    what&#39;s not said, but not for just its own sake. In that case for example,
    leaving the text in wouldn&#39;t have made it &#34;valuably&#34; less subtle &#40;because
    anybody who&#39;s heard what a California job case is also knows what a type case
    <i>looks</i> like&#41;, and it would have preserved the joke. Without that text,
    the shirt was just cool, instead of being cool <i>and</i> funny. To be fair though,
    the shirt was still good without the text. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    familiarity with designing for a t-shirt, something you can&#39;t really learn
    without doing once - but we don&#39;t need to require such particular expertise.
    <BR> <BR>The rules say that a winning shirt might be modified, and I think somebody
    who realizes his experience with designing for a t-shirt is lacking  would probably
    take the advice. <BR> <BR>Yes, if a shirt is totally covered with graphics for
    example, that&#39;s bad news. But something like a 75% resize for a &#34;stand-alone&#34;
    image should be seen as an open possibility. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    let me say that my fellow judges and I liked the concept of the &#34;I like type.&#34;
    T-shirt more than the actual design. We would rather see it in another classic
    typeface - my choice would be A.G. Old Face - with nice tight word spacing and
    perhaps a little smaller on the shirt, &#40;as though it was slightly shameful
    to be walking around announcing - hell, advertising - one&#39;s predilection.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;d wear another silk-screened red t-shirt.
    &#40;I already have a Dolly shirt, which is plenty.&#41; <BR> <BR>Personally,
    I find the concept and content of the shirt to be the most Typophile-ic. Other
    designs may be said to be more beautiful. Some Ts looked as though they had been
    plucked from the Priced To Sell rack at Urban Outfitters, their only tie to Typophile
    being the word &#34;Typophile&#34; added somewhere. To me personally, those U.O.
    shirts weren&#39;t even worth considering for the contest, as much as I may have

    simple, like ultra-super-duper simple. Its a smack upside the head. Now that its
    won, it would almost be awkward to hold another contest.  <BR> <BR>I agree with
    Christopher&#39;s comments about it, and nodded while reading Chester&#39;s. &#40;would
    never have thought that the winning tee would highlight Helvetica&#41; - Its great
    to hear the ideas behind the decision, and I&#39;m not knocking the choice at
    all.  <BR> <BR>Personally  I have my own little hate thing going on with helvetica,
    I&#39;ll get over it in a year or two, I&#39;ll buy a shirt regardless, I could
    wear it, but have to save face, stand by and definately not wear it to work -
    sucks to be me for now. <BR> <BR>could we get it in B/W purdy please?

    <BR>Eduardo, now that you are identified as the designer, I am curious, did you
    draw the fleuron also? <BR> <BR>The &#39;typophile&#39; ambigram that Mark Simonson
    did recently on the &#39;Holy Sh&#42;t&#39; thread is so great, it would be great
    if it could become and outside-the-contest T-shirt... '

    <BR> <BR>Great job. <BR> <BR>

    this comment you made about one of my entries: <BR> <BR><i>&#62;39...&#40;2nd
    alt&#41; I think one of the best  <BR>&#62;and most &#34;complete&#34; &#40;concept,
    aesthetic,  <BR>&#62;description of &#34;typophile&#34;-somehting that  <BR>&#62;is
    absent or given poorly from the most works &#41;.  <BR> <BR>&#62;I admit it with
    &#34;heavy heart&#34;...since it is  <BR>&#62;not among the ones i sent, but also
    i feel  <BR>&#62;satisfaction that i had such a competitor.  <BR> <BR>&#62;congratulations!  <BR>
    <BR>&#62;christos</i> <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t even see it until a friend wrote me
