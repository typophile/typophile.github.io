  cannot find it. I vaguely remember having seen it elsewhere but I cannot be sure.
  The album is from the mid 1980s.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
  for viewing!\r\n\r\n<img src=http://i.imgur.com/iVPwTkq.jpg></img>"

    target='_blank'>made a font out of it</a>. I doubt you'll find anything closer
    digitally.
