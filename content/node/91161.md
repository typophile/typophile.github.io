    could join better with the letters.\r\nIt reminds of Chesterfield\u2019s mark,

    C. I kind of liked the idea of a drop-cap-esque beginning--as if to say, \"Check
    me out, this is important.\" I don't mean it actually has to be bigger, but more
    grand.\r\n\r\nFor the strokes I think the darkest one, top line in the middle.\r\n\r\n"

    to render my logo useless in a way,\r\nbecause the motive was to make a logo that
    does stand out. i do understand what you're saying though. \r\nAre you suggesting
    I don't try to make it too elaborate? And use that energy in the designing of
    the brand and identity instead?"

    you might as well have nothing on the page."

  body: "The mock-up cases look a bit stripped and bare. That might be the point,
    but even so, to me it looks like they \"lack\" visual elements or refinement.
    Is the \"Let'em Burn!\" slogan on the mock-up backside supposed to be off center?
    If so, why?\r\nI personally like the \"MADE IN HELL\". It is a concept and you
    can be self-ironic. Pushing it one step further would be to take the essece of
    that slogan and bring it to a level that actually could be on a real product with
    a young non-mainstreamish target group. Something like \"The stuff from hell,
    made in San Diego\" (just a clumsy example of what I mean).\r\n\r\nOverall, I
    like how you developed the blackletter script from your initial post. Maybe you
    could pick up the diagonal energy and intensity of the font in some way, or highlight
    the contrast to the more reserved serif even more clearly? The \"Let'em Burn!\"
    slogan stands out from the overall concept as an isolated element."

  body: ">  has there been any discourse about design and ethics\r\n\r\nNot sure specifically
    what you're referring to, Christopher, but it brings to mind two events in my
    past related to design and cigarettes.\r\n\r\nFirst, when I was a college student
    we had a guest speaker who worked for Phillip Morris' ad agency (the Marlboro
    account, I think). He talked about designing cigarette packaging, advertising,
    and signage. He got a very hostile reception from many of the design students,
    much to the embarrassment of the professor who had invited him.\r\n\r\nSecond,
    the only design job I've ever turned down for ethical reasons was when I was asked
    to design a cigarette-related brochure.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I've got no
    problem with adults smoking if they choose to, and I occasionally smoke a cigar
    on special occasions. But I wouldn't feel comfortable promoting them."

  body: "@JamesM\r\n\"He got a very hostile reception from many of the design students\"\r\nI
    feel that many designers and design students feel that they're on some sort of
    moral high-ground. They're the good guys that have to change the world. \"oh we
    can't promote smoking, its bad, we have to stay healthy and influence others to
    as well. we're so good.\" and so on.  The students giving the speaker a hostile
    reaction might have just been a way to make themselves feel righteous. It would
    have been smarter to just listen and learn something from that individual. \r\n"

    read that clove cigarettes typically contain 60-80% tobacco.\r\n\r\n> i'd understand
    if someone were to get upset about this project.\r\n\r\nEtahchen, I wasn't criticizing
    you personally and your project doesn't upset me. It's an interesting project
    and I wish you good luck with it. I was just mentioning 2 related incidents in
    my past since Christopher brought up the general subject. \r\n\r\nBut of course
    this is a subject that many designers face occasionally. Do you accept a design
    job for a company that makes a controversial product, or for a company that has
    taken actions that you disagree with? And if you do accept the job, are you willing
    to put up with any criticism you might get for working for them? (For example,
    one of my clients is a large corporation and I once had a friend criticize me
    for working for them.) These are real-world situations that designers face sometimes. "
