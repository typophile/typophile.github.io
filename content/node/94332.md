  wine label font, I thought it might be Citadel Script, but on closer inspection
  it's not. It doesn't seem to be Shelley or K\xFCnstler Script either. The 'r' is
  quite nice.\r\nAny help appreciated.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/palacios_6004.jpeg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_Sample_5115.jpg]"
