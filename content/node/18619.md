  It just looks wonderful: Gill Sans made Evil. In 10 pt text, printed photopolymer,
  it could even be pleasant to read.'

    I do think mine will be better, especially the italics!\r\n\r\n\u2014K"

  body: "Well, I was inspired to make roman sans & italic out of straight lines after
    seeing the Crouwel / Foundry Gridnik, Emigre's Journal and Storm's Preissig Antikva.
    \ However, mine is optically constructed rather than strictly geometrically. I
    am assuming that at 'text' sizes that it will lose the sharpness. Here are a couple
    of working screenshots, since you asked so nicely!\r\n\r\n\u2014K\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Victor.png]"

  body: "Cowboy: Yes, I did see that. I am quite aware of the M-formula, and I think
    it has great merit. The whole concept is still gestating in my swede, I'm waiting
    for it to turn up in a design one day! \r\n\r\nGeorge: Cheers! The italic was
    originally totally upright, but had to leave that as the caps wouldn't play nicely.
    Perhaps for display\u2026\r\n\r\nI'll keep y'all updated, still have a few bits
    'n' bobs to sort out still!"
