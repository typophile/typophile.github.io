  this font: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_4920.jpg]\r\n\r\nI have had
  trouble identifying it, and even online 'softwares' cannot match it to an existing
  fond correctly.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nB"

  body: "Hi Don,\r\nIt does look like, especially Peignot Demi. Yes, hehe, very French
    ;) \r\nIt's still different, though, as the middle bar of the E is not in the
    middle (but higher) in \"P\xE9gase\" and is shorter and the loop in the P doesn't
    end in the middle either, but goes lower. Also, the bar in the G goes down rather
    than being 'rounded'. Finally, there's that slight Art Deco look (for example,
    the middle part of the S and the G).\r\nSee what I mean? (I'm sorry I don't exactly
    have the right terminology..)\r\nHave a nice week end!\r\nBen"

  body: "Hi Benjamin, when I said \"some version\" I included hand lettering.\r\nAlso
    very similar is Roger Excoffon's Chambord, not digitized. That's not to say that
    someone might have created a font with exactly these variations.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks for mentioning Chambord, Don. It caused me to investigate further.
    <a href='http://typophile.com/node/75590' target='_blank'>Here</a> is an old Typophile
    thread that yields a link to a PDF showing Chambord's variants (I rather like
    the condensed). Also, an interesting assertion from Hrant. If true - and Chambord
    <em>does</em> look very derivative of Peignot - it might explain why nobody has
    been eager to digitize it. Or maybe it's just licensing issues ...

    to tell if this is a pointed A as in Peignot or a blunt top A as in Chambord.
    I am still leaning towards hand lettering based mainly on Peignot. But...\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Hi,\r\nRegarding the dates on the Chambord pdf, I must mention that this
    case from the 30s (apologies, I forgot to last time). I do not know if it predates
    the 1937 Peignot or not. It does appear to be hand lettering based on the slightly
    different Es."

  body: "Thick and thin sans lettering has had some popularity since the 1890s. Early
    examples of such fonts include Taylor/Globe Gothic and Studley [not digitized].
    It is quite possible that the similarities to Peignot & Chambord are the result
    of independent evolution of lettering styles.\r\nDon"
