  body: "Looks very much like Bank Gothic, except that the R is wrong:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bank-gothic/\r\n\r\nWrong
    proportions, but similar letterforms:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/aggie/\r\n\r\nClose,
    but the crossbar on the E is too long:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/microgramma/"

  body: Can't find a perfect match either. Concur with Kevin on Bank Gothic, /E crossbar
    width distribution looks pretty close. /R would also be not so hard to redraw
    starting with /P and adding the upper right fourth of its counter as leg.
