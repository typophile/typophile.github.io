  seasoned type designers. I'm more concerned with the letterforms, as I haven't put
  a huge amount of time into spacing yet, but feel free to comment on any aspect.\r\n\r\nEDIT
  (text-sample.pdf): Changed shapes of efgrstuxzK and Eth. Fixed grave direction.
  Spaced lower- and uppercase. Haven't done kerning yet."

    everybody love it so much that they're speechless?

  body: "I downloaded the PDF when you first posted it, then got distracted and didn't
    follow up. I like it in general. A Goudy-like feel.\r\n\r\nA few random, non-exhaustive
    thoughts:\r\n\r\nLC e is perhaps a bit too closed\r\nLC f needs a stronger crossbar\r\nLC
    g is too noose-like. As Gary Munch keeps telling me: \"Think of the bowl as if
    the counter were to be a soft triangular form.\" The upshot: raise the right side
    of the lower bowl.\r\nLC r is a bit too wide\r\nLC s and c don't show the same
    angle of movement. The s is too upright.\r\nLC u us perhaps a bit too wide\r\nLC
    x may be too wide, depending on your final spacing\r\n\r\nUC K (and perhaps also
    lc) has the leg too low and droopy.\r\n\r\nCurly braces are too shy. \r\n\r\nThe
    cross bar in the 4 being warped just doesn't work for me.\r\n\r\nWhat is the D
    with the tilde?\r\n\r\nThe grave accent isn't right. Check your curve's direction."

    an Eth. Does it not work?"

  body: The Eth has a straight crossbar. See for example <a href="http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.11/index.htm">Gunnlaugur
    SE Briem's</a> discussion of this.

  body: "I know what a standard Eth looks like (Gunnlaugur SE Briem\u2019s articles
    and experiment taught me much of what I know). I see my sample did not include
    my hyphen, but it also has that wobble in it. If it is ugly or hard to read, please
    say, but I rather like it."

  body: "If your hyphen is a tilde, there may be other problems. For example, how
    would you represent www.fake-address.com/~mypage? \r\n\r\nI don't think the Eth
    is ugly, but it is very unstandard, and thus will draw more attention to itself
    than need be. "

  body: "While I don't think I'd set a URL in this face (in fact, I explicitly considered
    URLs when I did then hyphen), I guess someone else probably would.\r\n\r\nI've
    taken another look at it, and I've decided I prefer a plainer hyphen anyway."

  body: "I really like this. It has this quirky, old-fashioned look about it. Warm
    and inviting.\r\n\r\nI'm no expert, but the crossbar on the lowercase 'e' looks
    a little too slanty to my eyes, and the lowercase 'g' looks... too conventional?
    It doesn't seem as playful as is could be, given the rest of the letters."
