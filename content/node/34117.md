  is a scanned part of a headline in the magazine Total Film, and I really like the
  this forceful minimalistic font, but haven't been able to identify it (using www.whatthefont.com
  etc).\r\n\r\nIf anyone here is able to help, I'd be ever so grateful.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nm."

    bold isn't quite black enough.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to say. You guys are amazing!
    Thanks!\r\n\r\nm."
