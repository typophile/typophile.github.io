body: "So I designed an /o/.\r\n\r\nIt looks fine to me, but it's perfectly symmetrical
  (with respect to a 180\xB0 rotation), and since I know the upper half tend to look
  bigger than the lower one, I thought perhaps I should apply some optical corrections.\r\n\r\nSo
  I examined some /o/'s of well known fonts, comparing them to their 180\xB0 rotations,
  and found out that indeed none was actually symmetrical.\r\n\r\nSo what's the procedure?
  Create a perfectly symmetrical /o/, then just move up the right- and left-most nodes
  a little? That sounds na\xEFve, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nHow do you progress once you
  have a perfectly stmmetrical /o/?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMy /o/:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/my

  body: In the examples shown, the differences are insignificant. I'd say your o is
    good to go. Visual center is more important to things that <em>have</em> a center,
    like s, x, H. So, for instance, if the o had a dot in the middle, you would have
    to raise it.

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is gonna sound more naive: my humble opinion is
    that your /o/ optically looks perfect. Maybe if you put the /o/ in context with
    other letters this issue could be more visible. Your typeface will not be better
    if it is done following the well known fonts. Karen Cheng says that there is not
    one correct way of designing typefaces, I cannot agree more.\r\n\r\nBye. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, I've examined more professional fonts, and none had a perfectly symmetrical
    /o/. \r\n\r\nWhy is it so, then? I mean, at least since fonts are being designed
    using computers, it's easier and more natural to create symmetrical /o/'s. So
    if they're not, there must be a reason, wouldn't you say?\r\n\r\nPerhaps most
    type designers don't even start with symmetrical /o/'s? But how do they start,
    then?\r\n\r\nI'd be grateful if other type designers could reflect on their experience
    with designing /o/'s."

  body: "One general thing I learned at lettering class back in design school is that
    the top-right segment of curves such as in the \"D\", but actually also the \"O\"/\"o\",
    may need to be a bit more pronounced, otherwise they can look deflated or even
    slightly backslanted. Not sure why this is. But like with all optical corrections,
    trust your eye; and it might be easier to stop staring at that \"o\", move on
    to other glyphs, view the \"o\" in context and if it rubs you the wrong way, then
    correct it. Not so much because others do it, but because you can see why.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing I've been wondering about for a while: To my eye, in symmetrical \"o\"s
    the top curve (near the x-height) tends to look very slightly thinner than the
    horizontal bit at the bottom, near the baseline. I have no idea why this is, and
    it depends a lot on the design at hand, but in your \"o\", I personally would
    move the topmost node of the inner contour down by a unit or maybe even two. I'd
    be curious if others see this too. (There are some fonts that do this correction,
    like Helvetica (1 unit in the Regular), or National (2 units).)\r\nI'm not an
    expert at this, BTW, so take with salt."

  body: "Interesting question. I agree with Nina about the top right curve, and I
    usually draw it with emphasis there, and slightly raise the right hand extrema
    too. I suspect my /o/s are very unsymmetrical as I draw them by eye without any
    kind of flipping or rotating. I start by drawing two ellipses then push and pull
    the nodes and BCPs manually without measuring until it clicks. \r\n\r\nNina, I
    wonder about your second point. I wonder if it's something to do with reverse
    optical centring. To optically centre black parts of a glyph we raise them slightly
    above the geometric centre; here we might find the opposite works because we're
    dealing with a counterspace? I'll check out the fonts I've designed later to see
    if I've corrected the o this way."

  body: "One reason a letter might not be symmetrical is just by chance\u2026 at least
    with FontLab Studio where all nodes have to sit on whole coordinates what I've
    found is you can draw a circle using the shape tool and it can randomly draw out
    to be an even height/width when it needs to be at odd dimensions\u2026 so that
    the center nodes rest on the odd coordinate and either side is even\u2026 the
    more you scale said shapes up and down the more things can potentially become
    distorted\u2026 depending on the scaling and UPM size. You can see what I mean
    by drawing a few circles/shapes with 1000 or lower UPM and scaling it at extremes
    then doing a horizontal/vertical axis mirroring to see the symmetry get thrown
    off."

    next to its left counterpart. Do you see it?\r\n\r\nHowever, if you look at the
    three \"well known\" /o/'s I examined, you'll notice that the middle one has a
    thinner bottom curve, while the right one has a thinner top curve. I wonder if

    It's quite fascinating, though has the potential of confusing you more. Beware
    of further questions! ;-)
