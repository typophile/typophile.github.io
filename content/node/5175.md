  body: Heck, there&#39;s even a rivalry between NoCal and SoCal! The NoCal designers
    are uptight and too white. ;-&#41;  I&#39;m kidding, it&#39;s mostly my imagination.
    In type design the only rivalry I&#39;ve really gleaned is between Americans and
    Europeans - but you have to pay very careful attention to smell it. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    I recently learned that if you&#39;re a graphic designer in Mexico, you better
    be from Tijuana if you want max peer respect. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    big inside the U.S. was going on.  Seems like there would be at least something,
    given the fact that different interests have based themselves on the two coasts
    &#40;at least in my mind&#41;--East coast:  book publishing, West coast:  entertainment/computer
    industry. <BR> <BR>Is the Tijuana thing true?  Several years ago I lived in a
    region in Mexico &#40;Oaxaca&#41; that was about as far geographically and culturally
    from Tijuana as one could get; now I&#39;ve never been to Tijuana, but every sign
    and work of graphic design in Oaxaca seemed as if it were in emulation of something
    in Tijuana &#40;or the pictures I&#39;ve seen anyway&#41;.  Interesting.'

    Renner&#34;: <BR> <BR>&#34;The truly Modern, that is, the undistorted expression
    of an objective Zeitgeist, is only what we hold today to be timelessly perfect.
    This is not the same in all periods, because the insight into the timelessly valid
    changes from generation to generation&#34; <BR> <BR>and <BR> <BR>&#34;For the
    Modern is an idea, an unending task, never to be entirely resolved. We seek it
    on a narrow ridge, which drops away on one side into thoughtlessly adopted convention
    and on the other side into the Modish, which is mostly a somewhat foppish exaggeration
    of the Modern at any one time. this ridge is no comfortable middle way.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>I would have thought this understanding of the Modern would be sympathetic
    to you, Hrant, rather than demonizing Modernism as a banal &#34;fitted to the
    grid&#34;. <BR> <BR>But surely there are Modernists, Traditionalists, post-Modernists,
    post-traditionalist, etc., all over the geographical compass, and most designers
    don&#39;t categorize themselves in these or any terms, we just do it. <BR> <BR>And
    if we do categorize, is it by which side of the country we live on, by which side
    of the bed we sleep on, or somewhere in between? Get over it -- it&#39;s the principles
    that matter, not the people or where they happen to live. <BR>'

    Interesting. <BR> <BR>Forgot to address that. It&#39;s the other way around actually.
    Oaxaca is one of the oldest and more culturally important cities in Mexico. Some
    of the finest artists and craftsmen live and work there. Tijuana, having the identity
    crisis that it has, borrows a lot from Mexico&#39;s vernacular which is born in
    &#34;more Mexican&#34; cities like Oaxaca or even Mexico City.  <BR> <BR>Equally
    though, Tijuana has one of the most visuallly- and linguistically-intriguing vernaculars. '

    <BR>I do see differences myself &#40;and somewhat parallel to the graphic design
    field, not suprisingly&#41;, it&#39;s just that I haven&#39;t noticed <i>rivalries</i>.
    I guess because type design is a more insular activity, there&#39;s more of a
    &#34;whatEVER&#34; attitude to peers. <BR> <BR>---- <BR> <BR>&#62; &#34;The truly
    Modern .... <BR> <BR>And not just only in his day, but only on his island. Modernism
    is <i>never</i> perfect - nothing is. <BR> <BR>Modernism is not useless, and I
    do feel sympathetic to it to some extent, but it&#39;s also half the story. Because
    we are humans, not machines, and the most important thing to realize is that total
    control is impossible. Modernism considers perfection to be possible &#40;even
    if only theoretically&#41; - this is arrogant and naive. <BR> <BR>&#34;.... which
    drops away on one side ... <BR> <BR>And then the ridge ends, and you have to jump
    anyway. <BR> <BR>&#62; is it by which side of the country we live on <BR> <BR>Not
    entirely. But certainly Europeans are more Modernist than Americans for example.

    is generalizing, but this whole thread is about generalizations. <BR> <BR> <BR>Also,
    type design is very different in each European country. But I don&#39;t think
    that this is a big secret. I do think that there are differences between East
    Coast and West Coast Type Design. Just compare Font Bureau and Hoefler-Freer Jones
    to Emigre, or PsyOps. Could Emigre have ever happend in NY or New England? Of
    course, T-26 might throw my whole hypothesis off. They are in the middle, geographically,
    but left stylistically.

  body: Having lived and worked in Italy, Switzerland and on both coasts -- Cape Cod
    and Sonoma County -- I think westerners mistrust any guy who wears chinos instead
    of jeans. I found designers and illustrators in Milan to be the most fun to be
    among, but then we were all young. In and around the Boston-Cambridge area I found
    illustrators to be very open and helpful whereas designers were uptight almost
    to a man. &#40;Note that I did not say woman. &#41; It might be that we were all
    that much older and competitive. Yes, it&#39;s generalizing, and I&#39;m guilty
    as charged.
