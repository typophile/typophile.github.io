body: I have a chance to participate in a radio program project for my G.D. School
  in a local kind of cultural radio station. <BR> <BR>We are looking for some topics
  and ideas for the program &#40;we have a first chance to try and will continue depending
  on the quality and success&#41; so I wondered if anyone has a sugestion. <BR> <BR>Our
  main problem as G.D. in the community is that our work is not valued, it is perciebed
  as an artistic ornament for products. <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>

    design as a communication tool? How it functions as opposed to being purely ornamental?  <BR>
    <BR>Perhaps a discussion of how design is inescapable and impacts practically
    everything you do. Most people don&#39;t realize that even their road signs are
    designed. '
