  I am posting it again. \r\n\r\nI am Working on my first (full) font in my third
  year of graphic design studies. I can't seem to find any examples of x height in
  relation to uppercase L serifs. I'm creating very thick title face with hairline
  terminals and large hairline serifs, huge \"balls\" ie r a j f y etc. \r\n\r\nBut
  I'm having trouble finding a resource for em square examples. I need to see some
  letters (like L in relation to x height) on a proper em square and can't find one.
  I should have a book but I don't. So does anyone know of any? am I gonna have to
  pony up and buy a book? \r\n\r\nSecond question. Is there a basic free/shareware
  fontlab type program? There is one classroom at my school that is in use basically
  all the time and I will need many hours (as I'm sure you know) once I have finished
  all my drawings. And once I am done I am gonna repost all of them in the critique
  section for a good old fashion ass kicking.\r\n\r\nthank you."

  body: Also I'm afraid my type might be boring/already done/average. I'm kinda freakin
    out. Is it acceptable to scan some of my sketches and post them in the critique
    section, or should I at least pen them first?

  body: "\" I need to see some letters (like L in relation to x height)\"\r\nAny normal
    application that composes type can show you how the \"L\" is sized to the em,
    by setting the L in consecutive lines with zero leading. The relative size of
    L to x is as easy as setting them at the same point size beside each other. \r\n\r\nI
    might be missing the true question, but I don't think one needs a book to learn
    about sizing a font to the em, or l.c. to uppercase.\r\n\r\nAlso, this is hardly
    the time to be \"freakin' out\" if you have only drawn them on paper so far. I.E.
    give your freak some time to grow to the out stage as you computerize the font.
    :-)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    substitute for FontLab, however--it has its own way of doing things--and runs
    poorly on MS Windows (solution being not to use MS Windows)."
