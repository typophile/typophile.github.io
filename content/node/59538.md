  logotype. I want to use it (or something similar) to create a street number for
  our 50s house. We'll probably get it made out of metal, so the chunky weight is
  quite nice in that respect.\r\n\r\nAll assistance and any other similar suggestions
  are most welcome.\r\n\r\nTIA"

    is similar, but lighter. Maybe you'll find some figures you can use in these lists
    of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/genres/casual_brush_script/?&sample_text=0123456789&sample_size=74">brush
    scripts</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/genres/casual_brush_sans/?&sample_text=0123456789&sample_size=74">brush
    sans serifs</a>. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/font_bureau/loupot_bold/?&sample_text=0123456789&sample_size=96">Loupot</a>
    would make some great address numbers.

  body: "Yes, Kinescope is probably the best bet from that list. I've come across
    that one before and while I do really like it, it's not quite right. The trouble
    is, now I've seen it, the Masterfile logotype is just perfect!\r\n\r\nI've contacted
    Underware to explain my predicament, haha. Nothing will probably come of that,
    but there's no harm in trying.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help."
