    the two words "NEWS" and "GROPER" since they are differentiated by colour anyways. '

  body: "Because of the two globes the four finger height looks a bit smaller to the
    \"NEWS GROPER\" text even though you made it of the same height.\r\n\r\nAnd it
    looks like you have two logos. Hand and globes. They don't connect.\r\n\r\nI agree
    with bergh about joining words."

  body: "Are the globes supposed to be male \"globes\" or female \"globes\"? If the
    former, maybe place the hand palm-up under the globes. If the latter, try placing
    it vertically with the palm facing the globes. Either way, the hand should be
    more curved.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
