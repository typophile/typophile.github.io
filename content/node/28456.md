  Illustrator, InDesign, XPress, Flash or Dreamweaver but can't figure out how this
  %*$@# Word software is working...\r\nCan you guys help me, please ? (...blushes...)\r\n\r\nVirginie"

  body: Well, first off, word is not a design program. Are they asking you to add
    the design elements to Word so they can laserprint them or do they just want an
    editable layout that they can print on the letterhead?

  body: My cllient wants me to incorpoarte the design of the letterhead I did in Illustrator
    so they can edit it in Word and type whatever they want in there and then print
    the whole thing on their inkjet printer on regular paper (...). I am about to
    convince them to offset print the letterhead but they need it asap so I'm also
    doing the Word version thing...
