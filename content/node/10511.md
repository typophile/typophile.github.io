  I tried myFonts WTF tool, and it spit out Drescher Grotesk and Neuzeit Grotesk,
  and it isn&#39;t either of them. <BR> <BR>Any ideas? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70574.jpg"

  body: It is very close to DTL Nobel, but of course not matching. How old is this?

  body: ach! dtl&#39;s Nobel... sure as heck comes a lot closer than fb&#39;s Nobel.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m guessing the image &#40;or at least the type&#41; dates to around
    1950, as the Willem Ruys was a ship that launched in 1946.   <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.timetableimages.com/maritime/images/nedb2.htm"

  body: it is similar to the one discussed in that thread... in fact, I think the
    sans thus linked is also DTC&#39;s Nobel. <BR> <BR>Sheesh, though... US$700 for
    one family with 7 weights.
