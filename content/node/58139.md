body: "There is a peculiar new humanist sans used on the screens of the local Fortis
  ATM machines, and it is also featured once on the BNP Paribas website. I know the
  sample is rather small, but I think there are enough trademark characters to recognise
  the typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BNP-Paribas_4976.jpg]"

  body: "Yves, I checked my Sans Guide, but this must be something newer than I have
    collected.The asymmetric C doesn't show up in many fonts, and none of them match
    the rest of these letters. Not many sans faces have a Roman 'f' like that either.
    (All of which, I am sure you know, and that's why you are asking this.)\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Indeed, I'm completely lost with this one. It may very well be a custom designed
    face. I think I'll ask around with my French friends. Still, if anybody has a
    clue or even a lead, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks. :^)"
