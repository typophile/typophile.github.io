  body: "If the letterhead is from the 1920s or 30s it is very likely that it is engraved
    rather than typeset. Note the variations in letter size and details, especially
    the L.\r\nNot a lot in the way of digital fonts that recreate the effect, particularly
    the K and S.\r\nSome general similarity in Piranesi, designed by  Morris Fuller
    Benton for ATF (1930) and digitized by Bitstream:\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/show?25S\r\nalso
    Dorchester Script by Monotype (1939)\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/show?J3\r\nPerhaps
    closer is a new design, Almibar, by  Manuel Corradine (2012)\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/show?2WQB\r\nDon"

    know that my great grandfather started the business in the early 20th century.
    I'll try the suggestions though\r\n"

    in Jaspert's _Type Encyclopaedia (1970)_ and none were closer than the digtal
    ones I mentioned.\r\nDon"
