  body: 'It''s a very rarely used face (at least I''ve rarely seen it) from the Seventies
    called Embrionic. As far as I know, there were only two weights--this one (Embrionic
    55) and an extra bold weight (Embrionic 85). I''ve only ever seen a complete showing
    of the bolder weight. According to an old Zipatone rub-down lettering catalog,
    it was designed by Graphic Systems. Minor detail: The lowercase "c" has been opened
    up. In the stock version, the opening is about as wide as the one in the "e".
    Finally, as strange as it may seem, this face had a complete set of swash caps.'

    like the swash \"Z\" and a few others, but the rest of the swash caps are a bit
    clumsy. Feels a bit like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/octopuss/\">Octopuss</a>."

    away - thanks very much for the time and info!\r\n\r\nI would love to know if
    anyone has an image of the '55 weight... or better still a source for a digital
    cut. This book cover just got me looking at my 'Phil's Photos' Sourcebook again,
    and there are some great seventies sans fonts in there - Wexford and Harry to
    name a few... but no Embrionic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Like I said, it's a rare one. I have only seen it in two places: The Zipatone
    catalog from the late Seventies (sample shown above) and a one-line listing of
    both fonts in the Solotype Catalog, showing only the names in their respective
    fonts. I'm sure there exist film font catalogs which include full samples, but
    none in my collection.\r\n\r\nI would be very surprised if either font has been
    digitized. There were a ton of typefaces (especially film fonts and rub-down alphabets)
    made in the Seventies that never became popular and faded into obscurity."

  body: Well, if you consider the incredible amount of time and effort needed to produce
    a good quality font it hardly isn't surprising that a lot of those fonts never
    made it to digital.
