  search field isn't working for me, don't know if it's the browser or the site but
  any search returns 'Your search yielded no results.'.\r\n\r\nAnyway I have 8 Opentype
  Fonts that I want to name so they appear as a family in application menus\r\n\r\nDuckhill
  Light\r\nDuckhill Light Italic\r\n\r\nDuckhill Regular\r\nDuckhill Regular Italic\r\n\r\nDuckhill
  Medium\r\nDuckhill Medium Italic\r\n\r\nDuckhill Bold\r\nDuckhill Bold Italic\r\n\r\nI
  have 'Learn fontlab fast, Leslie Cabarge', which explains this subject, but I still
  carn't get it to work. In applications like Indesign and Illustrator CS, I get random
  results were some of the fonts are avaiable and some aren't.\r\n\r\nI have also
  followed the tutorial at\r\nhttp://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=2843
  \r\nwhich again gets random results.\r\n\r\nI'm using OSX with FL 4.5 and Siutcase
  X1 to activate the fonts.\r\nCould someone please help with an expalination or tutorial.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch
  appreicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nc.\r\n\r\n   "

  body: If you have InDesign and Illustrator CS, you're bound to have Minion Pro and
    other large Adobe type families. Open the OpenType files in FontLab and follow
    the same naming conventions -- just substitute the name of your face where appropriate.
    Works like a charm.

  body: Also, take out spaces in the names between Medium and Italic; some of these
    programs see those names as identical, and if the style name is MediumItalic,
    it shows up as unique.

    it come with the InDesign or Illustrator files ?\r\n\r\ncrossgrove - I've tried
    all different combination of spaces and no spaces, but still no luck. \r\nI've
    provided some screen shots on another post if that helps with my problem.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/27645\r\n\r\ns. "

    are screen shots of the relevant info (File > Font Info) from FontLab 5 for a
    few Minion Pro fonts:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20060815141954_3422.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20060815142055_4391.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20060815142125_5763.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20060815142210_5472.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20060815142232_4544.png]"

    shaman to undo your curse, maybe look into the possibility that FontLab 4.5 has
    some kind of bug. I started using FontLab at version 5 under Windows, so it's
    not at all impossible that the exact same thing that works on my machine doesn't
    on yours."
