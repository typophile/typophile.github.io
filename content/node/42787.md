  art. I tried wmf and emf, in addition to pdf/eps, but they print with wierd artifacts.
  \r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to print vector art with Word?"

  body: I tried to deal with WMF files in the past and could never really get them
    to behave either. I don't know if more recent versions of Word can accept other
    vector formats or not. The stock solution was usually just to create high-res
    bitmaps of the vector work for the person to input into MS Word (which, of course,
    made it impossible to make slim PDF files for email purposes...)
