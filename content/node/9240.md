  an exact match and thought the sharpest minds in type may be able to help. Thanks.
  Any help is appreciated.   <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65281.jpg"

    target="_blank">ITC Bailey Sans</a> action going on there. &#40;That was a little
    tricky to ID because they managed to use the least distinctive characters in the
    font. Compare to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-bailey-sans/bailey-sans-itc-bold/testdrive.html?s=quirky+g&amp;p=36"

  body: Nice ID Mark! Thanks for your help. Somehow they did make a rather interesting
    sans rather bland. BTW, I just ran across your <a href="http://www.marksimonson.com"
    target="_blank">Notebook</a> page. Very nice use of TXP. How long did it take
    to design? I&#39;m starting on a TXP page now for a client and just getting to
    know it&#39;s idiosyncrasies.
