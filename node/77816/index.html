  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">A novice question here – a printer has given me ICC profiles to apply to a book job I&rsquo;m doing; I&rsquo;ve installed them successfully in the ColorSync folder in my library. Beyond that, I&rsquo;m not sure how to use them. How do I use them in InDesign CS4, and when exporting to pdf (Acrobat Pro v8)? How will I know that it&rsquo;s worked? Any help appreciated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, for greyscale images just place them as usual in InDesign, but do check in Acrobat Pro if they are still greyscale (only on the black plate) in the PDF. If they are converted to profiled CMYK then you and the printer will have big problems making them a neutral grey.</p>
<p>I presume you have set the Creative Suite &lsquo;Colour Settings&rsquo; in Bridge so that they are synchronized across your applications?
If you are in the US, then choose the &lsquo;North America Prepress 2&rsquo; setting.</p>
<p>Your images certainly don&rsquo;t adjust themselves. What a profiled PDF generation does is translate your RGB images into the optimal representation for the given printwork. This translation &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo; is the ICC profile itself. The printed piece will look as close as possible (given the limitations of process printing and paper stock) to how your RGB images look on an accurately calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>You must have a calibrated monitor to adjust each image in Photoshop. In OS X the manual calibration works well enough, but only if you turn on expert options. In Photoshop you work on your profiled RGB images and choose &lsquo;Proof Colours&rsquo; under the &lsquo;View&rsquo; menu as intermediate and final checks.</p>
<p>Remember – this is the executive summery – there are many ways to bork this workflow, and only a few ways to get it right.</p>

<p>As mentioned, getting good results converting the data in your image to the colorspace represented by the printer&rsquo;s ICC profile carries the assumption that the colorspace you work in accurately characterizes what you see. That&rsquo;s why your monitor must be calibrated. Over time, you can learn to work off a monitor, but it is best to make internal proof prints. We prefer ink jet, but a laser printer will work. It too must be profiled. A laser printer needs to be profiled daily, inkjets seem to hold up for quite a while, at least for grayscale.</p>
<p>It is best to have several profiles for your proofing printer, one to simulate uncoated stock, one for coated stock. Esp. for &ldquo;grayscale&rdquo; (rarer to find color to print on an uncoated sheet, though it happens). You will be stunned to see how low the dynamic range is with uncoated papers (i.e., what happens to the blacks).</p>
<p>Viewing conditions for the proofs are critical. Most printers use a strong, 5,200 K light. No reader uses such a light. Incandescent light is about half that. Both color temperature and intensity strongly affect how an image looks. I think it pays to check under both conditions and compromise. I prefer to work with a 3,200 K LED-lamp if limited to one source. Movable, to vary intensity.</p>
<p>It is uncommon for a printer to have/offer an ICC profile for halftone work, esp. for an uncoated sheet. We usually wind up having to create them by having the printer run our test grid, then measuring what happens on that press proof. But if done carefully, this technique should give you a pretty good profile for a specific sheet at a specific printer (but maybe not for a sheetfed versus web press at the printer). A good printer should be able to hold less than +/- 5% across time. If you take care, you can get pretty amazing halftones on an uncoated sheet; obviously better still with a coated sheet &ndash; almost double the dynamic range.</p>
<p>Be very careful about the colorspace when bringing B&amp;W images into InDesign.</p>
