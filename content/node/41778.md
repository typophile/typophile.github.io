  Mail (that's 'junk mail' to the average consumer) works and is here to stay for
  the foreseeable future. Given that this is such a tried and tested approach to hooking
  new business, why oh why do *SO* many companies treat it like the advertising equivalent
  of a drunken scribble on a pub napkin?\r\n\r\nI had a flyer through my front door
  today offering a 'third world clothing collection service'. You know the one; you
  give your old stuff to this company and they sell it on for a profit based upon
  the pretense of philanthropy. Well, this particular flyer was possible the single
  worst example of copywriting I have ever seen. Unforgivable grammatical errors,
  duplicated statements and spelling mistakes to embarrass the average six year old.
  \r\n\r\nNot that I would have been conned into giving them my belongings anyway,
  but this just made their hole even deeper. I really hope someone got fired for that.
  I know that some people in adland have a somewhat supercilious attitude to DM and
  feel it beneath them, but it really is, in my opinion, a powerful tool in the salesman's
  arsenal. Ogilvy said it fifty years ago and it still holds true today.\r\n\r\nDirect
  Marketers, please, for the sake of my sanity, have at least a little pride in your
  work. Of course this does not apply to everyone in the sector; as this rather extravagant
  example from BMW proves. Genius: http://www.adverbox.com/mini-5/\r\n"
