body: "Hi all \u2014 Any help with this is appreciated. I am trying to ID the typeface
  used for \"Freeman Sporting Club's\" wordmark. I believe it may be a modified version
  of \"Decima\" - http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/tipografiaramis/decima/ ... almost
  like certain crossbars have been lowered/raised, and it's corners have overall been
  rounded a bit.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to \"FSC's\" website for a specimen.\r\n\r\nhttp://shop.freemanssportingclub.com/collections/all\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
