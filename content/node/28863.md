    unappealing logotype for anything, and had you not mentioned what it was for,
    i doubt that \"athletic event\" would have been at the forefront of my mind.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt

  body: Here we are on typophile and we discuss type. Such a selection is in itself
    a praise to the qualities of the typeface. I know Nick and I was glad his work
    received (yet another) hi-profile recognition.

    Tuna. :-) But the poster says Disco! to me rather than swimming. Regardless congratualtions
    to Nick! '

    you're fine: last year's championships were in Montreal, where it was a horribly
    nasty financial mess and the organizer went hari-kiri on everyone.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I really love the poster. Brilliant font, Nick!  \r\n\r\nLinda"

    It was rubbish of the best sort. Who is Nick Cook?

  body: "The hues of the tar latte figure are painful on that blue and the magenta.
    And even with the amount space that lame type overwhelms, the background is still
    left wanting. \r\n\r\nThis effort, to me, looks like five disparate elements all
    forced upon a central axis, done in an attempt to meet a last minute deadline.\r\n\r\n\r\nHiro"

  body: I think there may be a strong cultural gap here. What's disco here is more
    everyday there. I think that if you look at a cross section of Australian graphic
    design it would be clear that this design is not as out of place as it might seem.
    That's my impression anyway - having been through a few Australian design annuals.
    Personally it doesn't conect too well with me. It seems a bit cheesy & disco to
    me too. But then I am hardly the audience. And it would be good at getting attention
    - which is the point. Anyway. That's my 35 cents.
