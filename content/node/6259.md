  body: 'Charlie <BR> <BR>Looking at a very early transitional gothic here, very close
    to the carolingian. Amazing double storied g there. <BR> <BR>Best bet if you want
    caps is Clairvaux from Linotype or else FF Carolus Magnus but I think that only
    comes with lowercase. <BR> <BR>Might be worth worming your way into the anti-commercial
    &#40;free&#41; font groups that specialize in pre-fraktur/fraktur. Some amazing
    stuff going on about there. Dieter Speffmann etc. <BR> <BR>Find your way at Luc
    Devroye&#39;s blackletter page. <BR> <BR>Start here <BR> <BR><a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/fonts.html"

    even if the links are not all updated.

  body: Luc&#39;s a character. <BR>But make sure you don&#39;t profess to liking him
    in front of font gestapo! Let&#39;s just say he&#39;s not a lover of Big Business.

  body: Clairvaux and Carolus Magnus are good commercial-grade choices. Depending
    on how many accents you need, you should also check out <a href="http://www.fontcraft.com">Scriptorium</a>
    and <a href="http://www.flaxart.com/f/shopping/prod_detail/main.asp?productID=66&amp;MainCatID=480&amp;catID=1975&amp;AID=5685192&amp;PID=673632">Callifonts</a>.
    <BR> <BR>Years ago I received a Callifonts <a href="http://www.flaxart.com/f/images/products/cmore/callifonts.pdf">brochure</a>
    in the mail. I don&#39;t know how complete the character sets are, but all of
    the designs appear to be original, although one reminds me of Ilse Schule&#39;s
    Rhapsodie. Callifonts probably has the largest available selection of uncials.
    <BR> <BR>Also check out the unique work at <a href="http://www.crazydiamond.co.uk/">Crazy
    Diamond Design</a>.

  body: John <BR> <BR>Hate to say it but if you tramp around enough you will find
    a digital copy of just about every face that ever existed. There are a lot of
    foundries &#40;commercial/anti-commercial&#41; concentrating on historical faces.
    The problem is that a lot of these are copies without any attending technical
    qualities. I have at least three versions of Rhapsodie and they all suck. Fraktur.com
    has one I&#39;d like to buy though, one of these days. Anybody have information
    on their fonts, other than what they have to offer in selection? That I&#39;ve
    got memorized. I actually had a few fonts of Rhapsodie in metal once upon a time.
    Quite a gorgeous thing.
