    of any better way to handle the headlines than to just use all caps in a chunky
    display face? And why is your masthead just a rehash of the headlines? Why does
    the cover look like an amateur magazine likely to be printed at a copy shop?"

  body: "I like it. It certainly is not  good glossy magazine design if that's what
    you're trying to achieve. I don't really like standard magazine design and I like
    the spareness of this, especially the Vampire Weekend page, although you slightly
    blew the crop of the photo.\r\n\r\nWhat I like about the cover is what James doesn't,
    but I always preferred fanzines to gloss.\r\n\r\nYour professor almost surely
    wants more \"design\" than this, but I don't\u2026\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "There are some basic typographic issues I found with your new design. \r\nFor
    example: \r\nI found few Widows in your text.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_5261.jpg]\r\n\r\nYour
    text blocks has some poor rags as well. These creates disturbing white shapes
    on the margins. Turning off the Hyphenation is not enough, you need some manual
    lines breaks and the paragraph returns where needed. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/B_6695.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nHave
    you followed any grid in your layout?"

  body: This looks to me like a rough start... basic elements placed where they need
    to go, but not much design per se. A music magazine is a great opportunity to
    really push the design... this looks too sparse and corporate for a music mag.
    I would take a trip to your local book shop or newsstand, and have a look at music
    mags... they usually are much more interesting. You need more color, graphics,
    backgrounds. Mix up the typefaces. Tweak the photos... mix it up. It's too static.
    Good luck!

  body: Just reading through the other comments, I think you can still keep a fanzine
    look while pushing it more... fun assignment...
