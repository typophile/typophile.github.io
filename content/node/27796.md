  can't be acceptable? Who is this mysterious gthompson anyway? Have his licence revoked.
  No, better still, have him tarred and feathered.\r\n\r\nAhem. Sorry about that.\r\n\r\nCan
  the spam be removed and the genuine newest posts be put back?\r\n\r\nOr maybe they
  are genuine posts from head office? Ooops."
