  body: "French might be \"Du plaisir toute l'ann\xE9e...\" or \"Profitez-en toute
    l'ann\xE9e...\" depending on what you mean by the original phrase. What's the
    context?"

  body: In English it could be "enjoy X year-round" (or "all year round") but as Jongseong
    says, it really depends on the context.  In most cases, "pleasure" is the wrong
    word for this kind of thing, at least in American English.
