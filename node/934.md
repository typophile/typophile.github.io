body: These two fonts are called Reporter Light &amp; Bold on the CD. Note the midlevel
  crossbar on the f &amp; t. <BR> <BR>The bold variant has ink traps in the M,N,V
  &amp; W. In the M, especially, these traps are really deep and yield the ugliness
  seen in the image. Happens in &#40;inkjet&#41; print as well. I assume the typeface
  hails from pre-digital days then, correct? I&#39;m not sure why the bold g looks
  distorted. It&#39;s not like that really. I&#39;ll have to open it up in my font
  editor and check it out. <BR> <BR>Look familiar to anybody? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14171.gif"
  alt=""> <BR>Oh, and Mike ... I received my &#34;Modern Encyclopedia of Typefaces
  1960-90&#34; today! Nice reference book. Thanks for recommending it. It&#39;s doubly
  useful because now I have Berthold specimen images that are actually useful &#40;unlike
  the Berthold Web site/PDF images&#41;. <BR><br> <BR><br>
