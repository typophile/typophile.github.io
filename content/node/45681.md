  body: "Are they really experimental fonts or are they creative lettering done with
    contemporary tools? There seems to be a trend toward referring to these sort of
    experiments as experimental typefaces or experimental fonts, especially in academia,
    and I wonder how much this:\r\nA) leads people to assume that these sort of letters
    should be best left to experimental work and\r\nB) reflects a disdain for hand-lettered
    work in some circles.\r\n\r\nThat said, these are great. The smoke letters have
    a fabulous organic feel, and I can imagine this whole thing worked up as a 3D
    software plugin that could also do similar plant and hair effects. Swade really
    shows how much you care about your work; you elevated a contemporary design cliche
    to something exceptional. I don\u2019t know what to make of curly\u2014it seems
    to have been designed for a purpose not revealed as a simple specimen. And the
    graffiti letters are both authentic looking and (relatively) legible\u2014that
    isn\u2019t easy to do!"
