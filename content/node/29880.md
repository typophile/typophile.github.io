  body: "Due to the different mathematics involved (cubic vs. quadratic Bezier curves),
    converting a PostScript font to TrueType will generally add points along curves
    automatically. The results are predictable enough that the differences will only
    be noticible to the most sensitive designers, but sometimes they come out goofy.\r\n\r\nTherefore,
    unless it's necessary (some programs will only use TrueType fonts for some reason)
    or remarkably convenient to change the format, preserve the original format when
    doing platform conversions whenever possible."

  body: Maybe the foundry you licensed the font from will upgrade it for you? Most
    foundries seem to be quite sensitive to the desire for OpenType these days.

    of the Type 1 font and will work on both Mac and Windows. \r\n\r\nA."
