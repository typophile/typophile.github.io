    its not threating, simple, fine for a mutual fund.'

  body: I&#39;d consider stacking it &#40;METRO on top of the other words&#41; rather
    than making it all one line.

  body: The &#39;metro&#39; comes from the fact that these funds will invest in companies
    within a local &#39;metro&#39; area, rather than regionally or nationally. <BR>Another
    name considered was &#39;city growth funds&#39;, which has greater graphic potential
    &#40;I think&#41;, but metro was deemed a better descriptor.

  body: My problem is Metro could be Chicago, it could be New York it could be Norwalk
    Connecticut or even Paris. It doesn&#39;t sound focused. I personally would try
    to tie it into your local metropolitian area. I guess I think its to vague.

  body: Posting the stacked version. <BR>I prefer the inline version for business
    card. <BR>Metro is deliberately generic because the idea is intended for many
    local investment areas around the country, not just one. <BR> <BR>  <BR>All suggestions
    appreciated re layout or body/headline type to accompany? Guess futura is the
    obvious choice, but seems to diminish the logo identity when I try it. <BR>Many
    thanks. <BR>John<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64157.jpg"

  body: John did you look at Neutraface by House Industries. I think it might make
    the mark fresher and not so generic. Think about how the local branches or franchies
    can give a local idenity to Metro. No one wants to think they are anything but
    pampered to through investments. Otherwise why deal with a company and not direct
    invest?

  body: If you stack the words, like you show above, John, I would suggest a greater
    difference in weight between Metro and &#39;growth funds&#39;. Right now they
    compete too much with each other. <BR> <BR>Also, I would not go with Futura. I
    know it should communicate an urban sophistication, but it looks dated. Like it
    is &#39;retro&#39; instread of METRO. Especailly, with the added light blue elements
    between letters, it has an art deco feel to me. Is that whay you want? <BR> <BR>Also,
    I would try to work on making the second line the same length as the top line
    - maybe letterspace &#39;growth fund&#39;? <BR> <BR>Just some thoughts.

  body: Thanks for your interest. <BR> <BR>Daniel and Mike, I read you loud and clear
    on the use of Futura. What I like about the shapes is the slant on the capital
    &#39;M&#39;,&#40;And the appearance of reversal between &#39;M&#39; and&#39;W&#39;&#41;,
    which I can&#39;t get from Neutraface. Any suggestions for another less hackneyed
    choice which gives me the slant?  <BR> <BR>Mike, for some reason, the second line
    works better for me with the &#39;G&#39; centered under the &#39;M&#39;. I&#39;ve
    re-spaced it to meet this goal better. Seems like too much letterspacing otherwise.
    Maybe my relative point size isn&#39;t correct? <BR> <BR>Again, many thanks. <BR>John

    aren&#39;t typefaces expand your horizons

  body: I find the blue shapes distracting, and more distracting when stacked, as
    though it were a crossword clue with missing letters, maybe if you treated them
    more like a Mondrian you could use them to relate more to metro. I like Futura
    for this application but the N has always bothered me, it seems to extend above
    the ascender  &#40;and below the baseline&#41; too much. <BR>Tim

    Did you mean vary the colors, use letters as dividers, or what? <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: I think that &#39;R&#39; is a little too quirky for me. It&#39;s a stopping
    point. Maybe you could customize the leg.  <BR> <BR>I do like what you did with
    the positioning and size of the &#34;Growth Funds&#34;.

  body: One little problem ... I keep wondering for what the letters M-E-T-R-O stands.
    Those points, while obviously more of a spacer or visual element are making it,
    for me, read as if it is an acronym.

  body: John, <BR>I was thinking of shapes, not colours, so that they didn&#39;t act
    as a dash or separator, I suppose this would amount to different rectangles or
    L shapes, I was thinking, rather literally, of an abstract image for local areas.
    Like that font. <BR>Tim
