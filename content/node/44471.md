  sure this is a part of sharing a common historical model.\r\n\r\nSo, what do you
  call a \u201Cv\u201D or \u201Cw\u201D with dainty little stroked letters?\r\n\r\nWith:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/14caabdf997970729b8f851283c4860e_4416.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/b47a60d9c35c5b24519ca0716fab1bab_4356.png]\r\n\r\nWithout:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_3620.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4809.png]\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: I think those swashes in "normal type" stem from positional variants (on the
    beginning of words). They got promoted to primary forms in some fonts.

  body: "aszszelp> Thank you for your reply. So these are swashed letters! I was trying
    to formulate the words to describe it to someone else and I failed.\r\n\r\nYou
    bring up a curious thing, tho. At what point was there a departure from specific
    rules. As in: the swash figures belong in the scripts but not in the text? When
    did typographers start mixing it up? \r\n\r\nMany typefaces today like Miller,
    Hoefler Text, and Clifford are anthologies. Culled from many historical models\u2014a
    picking and choosing at the buffet table of type. :-)\r\n\r\nInteresting.\r\n\r\nThank
    you again.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "Well, I have seen those \"swashed\" v-s and w-s in pretty old printed text
    already, in 16th century, if I recall correctly, but 17th the latest! in medial
    position, so actually this might have been the one and only sort in that type.
    What I meant that when designing that type they were inspired by initial forms
    of the letters from handwriting. &mdash; c.f. your examples are from italic and
    not from roman fonts!\r\n\r\nI personally dislike having those \"swash\"-forms
    in italics (as the only ones). But that's personal preference."
