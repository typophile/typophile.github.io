body: 'This question may seem naive to the more experienced among you, but I am trying
  to find a source &#40;or sources&#41; for older typefaces that are no longer available
  commercially / digitally. I discovered a new book with great listings but the actual
  font displays were possibly too small... what I&#39;d like to do is find some books
  to have on hand to be able to re-create / digitize old fonts that seem appropriate
  for jobs -- or just re-draw nice faces for fun. I&#39;m mainly interested in late
  Victorian through 1940s faces, and I would need the whole alphabet displayed. <BR>
  <BR>My questions are: <BR> <BR>1. This isn&#39;t illegal is it? <BR> <BR>2. Does
  anyone have suggestions for new / old books for me to check out? <BR> <BR>3. Can
  you find actual antique type specimen books for sale somewhere? Ebay? <BR> <BR>4.
  Are some of you already doing this, and if so does it take forever to redraw a font
  from a good visual reference -- and do you end up with good results? &#40;I would
  be working in Illustrator.&#41; <BR> <BR>--Thanks'

    copyright protection in the United States. <BR> <BR>2. Copyrights beyond a few
    decades would be expired anyway.  Certainly nothing from the Victorian era, when
    copyright was 14 years and limited to book publishing! <BR> <BR>Another issue
    is plagiarism; selling a digitized typeface without acknowledging the original
    designer might be considered unethical &#40;but not illegal&#41;. <BR> <BR>90%
    of type design is revival or reinterpretation anyway.  Go for it! <BR> <BR>Paul'

    can be protected by design patent &#40;and has been since the 1870s&#41;, elsewhere
    &#40;including the entire European Union&#41; it&#39;s protected by a range of
    laws including copyright. <BR> <BR>I would say that, probably, everything during
    the era you are considering is out of copyright and/or any other protection &#40;except

    Yes, it pretty much takes forever to do a good job - not only do you have to get
    the outlines right but there will be few clues as to the kerning and spacing of
    such samples. If you really want to do this properly you should buy a type digitising
    application, ie Fontographer or FontLab &#40;you may be able to buy either from
    eBay too - I&#39;d recommend the latter because at least it is still being developed:
    <a href="http://www.fontlab.com" target="_blank">www.fontlab.com</a>&#41;.'
