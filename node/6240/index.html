A long term change in the membership demographic would further diversify the focus of the association's interest.

Note that Poland and the Czech Republic are a long way behind Argentina - are we seeing such problemswith Polish and Czech members whining about fees? <BR> <BR>Please also note the comparative wealth between Argentina and India - now whine some more about your situation? <BR> <BR>The figures point towards ATypI fees being something like half a days income in most Western European and North American states, and around two days income in Central Europe and South American states. <BR> <BR>This comparison is not worth arguing over, they eithr want to be members or they don't. <BR> <BR>A more problematic figure is the comparitive cost of attending the conference: a couple of weeks income in the better off places, versus a couple of months income in the less well off. <BR> <BR>There's no solution to this. But ATypI seems to have gone out of its way to put as much information as possible on the web in recent years, particularly in relation to the conference - this is superb access to those who cannot get to the conference itself (as I might add is this forum). <BR> <BR>In addition there is no reason at all why members anywhere in the world canot organise their own local events. <BR> <BR>While I'm here I might just note that there is comparitively low conference attendence and mmbership in Australia and New Zealand - again this is due to low local membership and the rigours of travelling - not the relative incomes.</div>

Argentina, Poland and the Czech Republic are all in the same economic range in the spreadsheet I am building. We currently have four Argentinian members, four Polish members and two Czech members. <BR> <BR>Perhaps the reason that our Argentinian colleagues are being so vocal is that, while the Poles and Czechs are gradually seeing their economies improve and are to be welcomed into the European Union in two years, the Argentinian economy is still very unstable, may collapse further, and Argentinians might justifiably fear that the world is turning away from them.</div>

We need to find more efficient solutions, not more complex ones. <BR> <BR>John et al., <BR>My suggestion is not anything new. Here in Canada Graphic Designers must belong to the provincial associations where they live if they want membership to the Society of Graphic Designer's of Canada. The accreditation here is close to becoming law for all practicing designers, offers benefit packages, mediates, runs conferences, describes our By-Laws and Standards.  <BR> <BR>So to get that membership&hellip;well take my situation for instance: I have 4 years combined education and practice specifically in Graphic Design (not including previous related feilds, illustration, the Arts, management ect.) but I still must wait another 3 years and study their massive reading list until I can take the test, and interview in front of the their Evaluation Board, pray I pass, and only then am I a member. For now I'm simply a &quot;Provisional Member&quot; regardless of any success or future certificates. 7 years total. <BR> <BR>The only creative and perhaps complex part of my suggestion is determining the fee/score ratio. While I don't suggest that the testing be as extreme as it is in Canada with all the time, and educational requirements; I strongly suggest you consider the approach before you write it off as complex. Many Associations run tests or review applicants before granting membership.  <BR> <BR>If the only pass to membership in ATypI is a cheque for base fees, then its not much more valuable then my Blockbuster card&hellip;and you run the risk of defending your Org in these situations where money becomes an issue (of which its clearly not) <BR> <BR>Reform isin't that hard.

I mentioned earlier that ATypI needs to find more efficient solutions, and this includes more efficient membership management and service. The association needs to do this anyway, regardless of whether fees are adjusted, because we need to free up resources for other things. <BR> <BR>There is also an economy of scale at work here: servicing two members does not cost double what it costs to service one. I suspect we are probably already near the point at which, for example, doubling the number of members to be serviced would not have a significant impact on resources, presuming an efficient management system. If you can service 500 members, you can probably service a thousand at not much more cost. <BR> <BR>I disagree with your assessment. I think there are grounds for discounted membership <i>and</i> a practical model for implementing it without risking a decrease in overall revenues. Of course there are further issues to consider, but these should be looked at by the ATypI board. I'm encouraged by the figures I have run, and think the possibility is worth the board's attention. I certainly don't think it is the place of an anonymous poster to a discussion forum to tell anyone 'no you can't have discounted membership'.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tanya writes: <i>If the only pass to membership in ATypI is a cheque for base fees, then its not much more valuable then my Blockbuster card&hellip;</i> <BR> <BR>ATypI membership used to require recommendation of existing members, review, etc., because the association was basically a private club for type manufacturers and type designers. Over the past decade, ability to pay has indeed become pretty much the sole criterion for membership. Remarkably, this has not generally lowered the prestige of the association, such as it is: the quality of membership remains high. The risk of devaluation of membership is there, but it hasn't hit in any significant way. Indeed, I think the increased diversity of membership has been very positive, offsetting the risk. <BR> <BR>The GDC is a professional association in much the same way that doctors and lawyers have such associations. It provides an organisation framework for defining ethical business practices, pricing norms, etc. There are very tangible benefits to membership and also tangible benefits to clients in knowing that the designers they hire belong to such an association. ATypI doesn't really function this way: it is a social and business association in which type designers, type vendors and font technology meet to exchange information, discuss common concerns, and celebrate a common love of typography. The latter aspect also attracts graphic designers, printers and other people with an interest in type. That is a very different constitution than a professional association like the GDC, in which all the members are basically involved in the same kind of work. One of the peculiarities of ATypI is that most of my clients are also members, which would certainly not be true of most professional associations.</div>
