  body: 'from the fontlab community site: <BR> <BR>Patric King and Lune have provided
    the following tips how to seamlessly copy-paste your outlines between FontLab
    and Illustrator. The described procedure works on Mac OS X 10.2.4 with Illustrator
    10.0.3 and FontLab 4.5.1, but should also apply to other versions.  <BR> <BR>1.
    In FontLab, check &#34;Do not reescale EPS...&#34; in the FontLab Preferences
    / General.  <BR> <BR>2. In Illustrator, change the units to points: 1 point will
    be equal to 1 unit in FontLab.  <BR> <BR>3. Make a box with 1000x500 points in
    Illustrator, add the baseline, x-height lines and whatever you want, make your
    drawing.  <BR> <BR>4. Fill or stroke everything with something. FontLab won&#39;t
    import paths with no fill/no line. <BR> <BR>5. Copy in AICB format &#40;you can
    change this in Illustrator preferences&#41;. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s necessary,
    but I have also turned off PDF copy. <BR> <BR>6. Paste into a glyph window in
    FontLab. You&#39;ll have to actually open the glyph window, which is annoying.
    <BR> <BR>You can now copy/paste between FontLab and Illustrator without re-scaling
    your outlines. It also works with Photoshop files, it might be useful when you
    bring bitmap images as background templates. Bon Appetit!'
