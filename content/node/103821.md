    Black</a> designed by Josef Albers as a geometric sanserif at the Bauhaus in 1926
    and produced by Paul Renner and the Bauer design office as a typeface in 1929,
    as part of the Futura series. The original design and variations are available
    from various foundaries. I don't know if the variation in your image has a unique
    name or was produced by a designer for the AIGA in 1965.\r\nDon"
