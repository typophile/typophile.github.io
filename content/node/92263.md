  I like this font.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bada_5782.png]\r\n\r\nWithout
  a doubt, it is the 'o' that takes this font from simple brush, to brilliance.\r\nThe
  evenness of the counter's tops and bottoms, don't hurt either.  And look at that
  crazy 's,' is it's baseline at 30 degrees? So much excitement packed to into yet
  very simple lines."

  body: What's your point? Do you have a question? Can't you find it? It's available
    from Blambot fonts. One of their free ones. There are some minor differences from
    your sample, like the lower left-hand corner of the 'U'. Where is your image from,
    by the way?

    think hate is too strong a word, they probably just don't like you very much.

  body: "What is there to add? Blambot sells fonts based on comics lettering. On their
    site there may be information regarding the lettering artist and or the comics
    series this was based on.\r\n\r\nThis style is mostly used for exclamations and
    \u2018sounds\u2019. Expressive works for something short like \u2018KABOOOMM!\u2019\r\n\r\nIs\u2019s
    nice, but I don\u2019t really like the excessive flaring. It looks somewhat like
    the lettering used in the French Asterix-comics."

  body: "I concur: lack of comment here about a particular typeface/font does not
    indicate hatred of it; merely apathy toward it.\r\n\r\nBut what you've got there
    is clearly a Display font with a lot of personality. Hey, I like http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Daniel.
    And for somethings, I like http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans. Neither
    typeface gets a lot of discussion here, and I get that. They are not to everyone's
    taste.\r\n\r\nAnd, many people here (as they are type designers themselves) have
    highly-developed tastes, experienced eyes, and have spent a lot of time thinking
    about bezier curves and things that you and I are hundreds of man-hours away from
    being able to compare ourselves to.\r\n\r\nDon't worry about whether or not your
    pet typeface is a hot favorite among type designers. Go create something that
    looks awesome (to you) in it. Go design something for which careful, tasteful
    use of your pet typeface solves the design challenge perfectly. If it works, it
    will work. If it doesn't, learn something from that."

  body: I think it is interesting that a lot of designers here look down their nose
    at "novelty" fonts.  Sure there are a lot of really awful silly looking novelty
    fonts, but then there are some really good ones, as Badaboom is IMO.  Where did
    this snobbery come from?  Was it taught in design school?  Is the ghost of Helen
    Armstrong still haunting us?

  body: "It certainly does express a lot of excitement, and it's very eye-catching.
    I mean that in the literal sense, use this font surrounded by a lot of other fonts
    and graphic design (such as on the web) and it captures ones eyes.  In fact this
    is how I first noticed Badaboom. It was used in one of those run-of-the-mill ads
    like \"you may have already won!\" Now, I usually tend to never look at ads, certainly
    not one as lame (font selection aside) as this ad was.  But every time I came
    back to the page, my eye kept wandering over to it, and I could feel its sense
    of excitement.  So excited! Maybe I DID WIN SOMETHING?! (I never clicked on the
    ad to find out).\r\n\r\nhrant, I wonder if you dislike all types close to this
    (excited ultra-bold brush sans, lets call it) or just this one in particular.
    \ Complete fail? Really?"

  body: Bada Boom is jo a display font, and the sparrows here tend to be into (making)
    text fonts, so it's pretty natural that it ends up outside their field of vision.
    Hell, I didn't notice it before, and I look at display fonts fairly often. Maybe
    I did see it, but it didn't set my catgirls bouncing.
