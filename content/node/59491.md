  want to use a serf font for the body text with Helvetica Bold for the project titles.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestion for a very light weight serif font? I tried rockwell but felt it was
  too heavy.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the advice!"

  body: "Well, if you like Rockwell, it is what is called a slab serif. If you do
    a search on this site for \"slab serifs\" you will find many a discussion that
    mention some good ones. the other thing to consider is that you may want it to
    match with a neo grotesque, which is what Helvetica is. \r\n\r\nI hope that helps.\r\n\r\n"

    hate you if the strokes take too much effort to see.

    like ITC Lubalin Graph Extra Light. I'll try playing around with that for a while.\r\n\r\nthank
    you so much for your suggestions. "

    nice thing about Officina is that it has a sans-serif version too. Not that I'm
    trying to steer you away from Helvetica Bold or anything . . . \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LucasOfficina3_6691.gif]"
