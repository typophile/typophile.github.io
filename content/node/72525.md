body: "Some weeks ago, I stumbled upon a variant of Stanley Morison\u2019s Times in
  which several characters of the italic cut differ from what nowadays is usually
  seen in this typeface. Have a look:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/timesold_4069.png]\r\n<!--break-->\r\n&nbsp;\r\nLowercase
  \u2018v\u2019 and \u2018g\u2019 differ noticeably from the standard TNR, shown below:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/timesnew_3484.png]\r\nUnfortunately,
  I don\u2019t exactly recall from which book I took the above snapshot. I reckon
  that it might have been a non-fiction volume from the 1970s, printed probably in
  the USA. What I do remember is that the colophon stated that the book was \u201Cset
  in Monotype Times Roman\u201D. This information, however, has not led me very far.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nCan
  you tell me something about the provenance of this mutation? Has it been used in
  Europe as well as in the States? Is there any relation between these character shapes
  and Morison\u2019s original drawings? And finally: Is there any digitised Times
  featuring a two-storey \u2018g\u2019?\r\n&nbsp;\r\nP.S.: I know this isn\u2019t
  precisely a type ID, but this board is where I hope to meet the detectives among
  you. Thanks in advance!"

  body: "I looked in the McGrew book of American Metal Typefaces and nothing is shown
    for Times with these letter variants. Also checked Jaspert's Encyclopaedia, Phil's
    Photo type book, and A.T.A. Type Comparison Book. In the book \"Typefaces for
    Books\" by Sutton & Bartam, they show Monotype and Linotype versions of Times
    New Roman. Both say \"educational characters available\". Thinking of Bembo Schoolbook,
    which uses a single storey 'g' in the Roman and Italic versions, and the fact
    that Morison was the one who directed the Bembo design for Monotype (according
    to McGrew), makes me wonder of perhaps that could explain these variants.\r\n\r\n-

    have been able to access all of them myself.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t sound unlikely
    that the characters shown above have been influenced by \u2018educational\u2019
    glyph shapes, although&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;if I remember correctly&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;a
    two-storey \u2018a\u2019 and a three-storey \u2018g\u2019 were used in the Roman
    text. And what is schoolbook-like about that italic \u2018v\u2019, slightly reminiscent
    of a Greek upsilon? Maybe it has to remain a mystery&nbsp;\u2026"

  body: "For typesetting mathematics, Monotype had a variant of Times with alternate
    v (to avoid confusion with greek nu). Here\u2019s an example from the <em>Monotype
    Mathematical Sorts List</em> booklet they made:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/times_327_5978.png]\r\n\r\nThere
    isn\u2019t an alternate g, but Times 569 (the math variant used with the [[http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/pdfs/tc_article_47.pdf|4-line
    mathematics technology]]) had both alternates:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/times_569_alternate_italic_g_v_4448.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    slant is not the same as in your example, so it\u2019s not that typeface, but
    given what your colophon indicated, it would be reasonable to think that Monotype
    had a variant of Times 327 with those alternate v and g."

  body: "Very interesting, thanks all!\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I have been able to
    find out that a (slightly different) digitisation of Times containing these alternate
    characters has been used by various scholarly journals, some of which are available
    online. The following screenshot is from one of those publications:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/timesdigital_4932.png]\r\nWhereas
    the slant of the \u2018g\u2019 is less pronounced than in the pre-digital sample
    shown above, the \u2018v\u2019 seems to be virtually identical, doesn\u2019t it?\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis
    journal typeface is embedded as \u2018Adv-Times-i\u2019, \u2018AdvMacTim-i\u2019
    and the like, \u2018Adv\u2019 <a href=\"https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0103&L=TYPO-L&D=0&P=41243\">allegedly</a>
