  somewhere to avoid too narrow columns as it compromises readability, understandably
  so. But are newspapers and magazines exempted from this rule? Is it not acceptable
  to apply the same narrow columns in a text book?\r\n\r\nCase in point..\r\n- 9pt
  ITC Stone Serif, 14pt leading\r\n- 2-column layout\r\n- each column 2.375 x 6.5
  in\r\n- 0.25 column gutter\r\n- 0.5pt rule in between columns\r\n\r\nWould appreciate
  any thoughts.. Also wondering if this type layout is reasonably accessible to both
  high and low level readers.\r\n\r\nThanks so much, anything helps!\r\n\r\nPS. I've
  searched the forums best I can for this topic, I apologise in advance if it's been
  covered before."

    from not justifying columns without enough characters to balance the spaces, there
    aren\u2019t really any solid rules. The nature of the text, the press, the paper,
    the font, character size, and so on all come into play, and the only way to really
    know what works is to set it up, print it out, and look at it. Convention is important
    to consider, but conventions vary and can\u2019t really be used to generate rules
    that apply to anything but conventional designs."

    see, that's a 14.25 pica column width, 1.5 pica gutter, and 39 pica column depth.
    Setting 9-point Stone serif (sets a bit large) with 14-point linefeed. Off the
    top of my head, I don't remember the characters-per-pica data for Stone Serif,
    but I'd guess is equal to or less than 10-point Times. \r\n\r\nYou don't say what
    the trim is (assuming this a book). The thing is, all spaces relate. My gut feeling
    is you have too much leading for what will amount to a pretty cramped column.
    The second thing is that the column gutter is wide enough that you probably don't
    need the rule.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this is a fairly narrow column; a lot will
    depend on the author's word selection. Scholarly prose not only has a lot of long
    words, equally important is the relative absence of short ones. Newspapers have
    an advantage here; the prose is suppose to be terse.\r\n\r\nThere is a big difference
    between \"elegant\" and \"unacceptable\"; it will be the details that determine
    if it is unacceptable\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Chipman, thanks so much for the tip, will look into it.\r\n\r\nAluminum,
    easier scanning is why I pursued a double column layout. The textbook isn't so
    much a textbook as it is a manual. It's a how-to that has lots of quick reference
    features and some selective in-depth information.\r\n\r\nWhat's a bit confusing
    is that newspapers do have lengthy articles that are set in narrow columns. These
    articles, I assume, aren't meant for scanning, like classifieds (granted an unfair
    comparison as the two have drastically different column widths). But yes, would
    be good to know the thinking behind newspaper layouts, or if there's been any
    sort of usability studies on columns.\r\n\r\nCharles, thanks so much for the insight.
    The top/bottom margins are 1 in, the inside/outside margins are 0.75 in. Apart
    from the occasional medical term, the prose is a bit informal so fortunately I
    don't have to worry too much over long words."

  body: "A lot of what is behind newspaper columns is flexibility. The have advertising
    to sell, and you can buy a variety of space. The more columns, the greater variety
    of advertising space available. There is some of this thinking in magazines as
    well.\r\n\r\nBut the article too can vary in column width, depending on how the
    editor/layout person chooses importance, copyfitting, etc.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nIt
    is unusual, in a book, to have equal top & bottom margins. It happens, but it
    is also unusual to have equal inside/outside margins. I don't know magazines very
    well; I do know scholarly journals, which tend to take on book characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe
    best advice I know of when you're unsure about something is to steal. Look at
    a popular/respectable publication in your field & steal & adapt everything useful.
    But watch out for differences in spacing; as I said, spacing all interrelates.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    we once did a book on Spina Bifida, & used the entire Stone \"Clan\" (serif, sans,
    and informal). <cite>Living with Spina Bifida: A Guide for Families and Professionals</cite>
    Chapel Hill, UNC Press. What shows on the web isn't the text as set, but here
    is a link:\r\n\r\nhttp://uncpress.unc.edu/chapters/sandler_living.html\r\n\r\nThe
    following link shows the book as set, though the book was obviously scanned (in
    the book, the side-rules are in red), so the type isn't as clear as if a PDF was
    used\r\n\r\n[[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=SScROpQ6v3sC&dq=Living+with+Spina+Bifida&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=HZD60ssmi7&sig=rT64qQC-hLwVGIOJxZJmaeGSV-Y#PPA49,M1]]\r\n\r\nIf
    you have obviously different voices or audiences, the different but related typefaces
    can help.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "You don't specify whether your text is justified or FL/RR. I wonder if the
    rule will look odd and off-center if the text isn't justified. Or whether it's
    necessary with .25\" btw the columns, as Charles said.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to
    be careful about with columns is the proportion of the gutter between the columns
    to the leading. If you have generous leading, as you do, make sure that it doesn't
    visually exceed the space between the columns and thus get confusing to read.\r\n\r\nBTW
    it would have been nice to see a sample rather than use our imagination."
