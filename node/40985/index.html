  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am working on a mixed-type logotype and I was hoping for some feedback.</p>
<p>The first version is comprised of Helvetica Light and Clarendon, while the second, of Bodoni and Nobel Bold (I tried Futura as a more usual pair of Bodoni but the un-stemmed u didn&rsquo;t work for me).</p>
<p>The logo is about a photographert and it means &ldquo;light dark&rdquo; (or &ldquo;light shade&rdquo; as I was told). The photogrpher wants to create a mixture of elegance and contemporary look at the same time, and this is one of my first ideas (even though the selected typefaces are not that contemporary - I am still working on it).</p>
<p>So, I was hoping for some comments on the spacing and the typefaces combinations (and perhaps other, more contemporary suggestions)? Which of the two versions would you go for?</p>
<p>Thanks in advanced

Or, whether I should make the left side (the light side) bigger on small sizes so that it optically matches the right side, again in small sizes. What do you think it&rsquo;s best?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Chiaroscuro properly refers to the innovation in painting whereby forms were represented as being primarily defined by light. Historically, artistically and aesthetically the term is inextricably wed to the Italian Renaissance. I would think that your serif font selection would be an opportunity to make that connection.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think it is really Italian Renaissance. Early painters who experimented with chiaroscuro were mostly Mannerists and Caravaggio — who has widely considered as the one who mastered chiaroscuro into perfection — was an early Baroque painter.</p>
<p>While historically not quite perfect, the second logo (Bodoni and Nobel) in my opinion is a great example of how I would understand chiaroscuro in typographic terms — better than the first, because of the interesting two-way contrast: the weight increases while stroke modulation and design complexity decreases. That is more sophisticated that the first approach which really just says &ldquo;little&rdquo; vs &ldquo;much&rdquo; of everything.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Though it&rsquo;s not exactly a Master&rsquo;s degree in art history, Wikipedia does have a thorough and accurate entry on the word:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaroscuro">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaroscuro</a>
To elaborate on my point, since the word itself actually has a technical and historical specificity to it—the Italian Renaissance—it seems that a font that more closely shares the same stylistic heritage as the word may be a better selection than a Bodoni. Just a suggestion. Personally I love that sort of thematic integration. 
Also, there is a danger with having too great of a contrast in weight here in that it begins to look like two separate words.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>George,</p>
<p>I must admit that I&rsquo;m a follower of the principle popularized by Robert Bringhurst (among others) that typographic emphasis works best if not too many variables are changed at a time. In your Jannon T Moderne Pro Italic — Auto Black I see not only the light–dark opposition but also a dynamic–static opposition due to the different inclination.</p>
<p>I still like the Bodoni–Nobel example best.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi gtrianta, due to the &ldquo;chiaroscuro&rdquo; background history, my vote goes to the second version (Bodoni/Nobel)! But I think that can exist better alternatives to this logo. If you want a mixture of elegance and contemporary look, why not try Didot / Gotham ?
I´ve made the test, and look the result:</p>
