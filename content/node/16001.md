  body: "Typophile pays you, because they collected the bets,\r\nafter taking a handling
    percentage. The only problem\r\nthough is latency. So instead of taking bets on
    indi-\r\nvidual font IDs, you bet on aggregate numbers, like\r\nweekly or monthly.
    Then for example if you had inside\r\ninfo that Mark was going on vacation, you
    wouldn't bet\r\non him until he got back - so we'll need the SEC to get\r\ninvolved,
    and...  ;-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
