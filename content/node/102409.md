  body: Hello Noel & welcome to Typophile. [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100036|Vitesse]]
    is a retail font distributed by Hoefler & Frere-Jones type foundry. It's not a
    free font and you have to buy it through their [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100036|website]].
    Though, on their website you cannot order just the bold weight, however I believe
    that they are reasonable people and if you really need the font you could [[http://www.typography.com/ask/faq.php#Ft_11|contact
    them]] with your enquires. Good luck!
