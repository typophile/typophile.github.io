  since 2011 becomes a whole font-family now. An extraordinary true italic with an
  18\xB0 angle and appropriate bold styles complete the family. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mevum_grotesque_textfont_teaser_4971.jpg]\r\n\r\nConcept\r\n\r\nMy
  aim to create a sans serif, which shouldn\u2019t look too cold and clean, but nevertheless
  have a technical look. Attend from the first sketches until the full realization.
  A simple rectangle shape with bevelled angles and slightly convex curves formed
  the base of this concept. Through that, Mevum bridges the gap between human and
  technology, without the letters appearing too  intellectual and unflexible. Mevum
  picks up characteristic trait e.g. from architecture, engineering, electronics,
  science and sports, thus areas that have in common their practicality and orientation
  after the human being and its lifestyle.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics\r\n\r\nIn spite
  of the reduction, the letters should express a friendly and warm personality, without
  loosing the distinction from one to another. Letters like the capital \u201CI\u201D
  an the lowercase \u201Cl\u201D are especially different. Furthermore the lowercase
  \u201Ca\u201D has a midbar, lowercase \u201Cg\u201D is two storied. The combination
  \u201Crn\u201D shouldn\u2019t look at small text sizes like a letter \u201Cm\u201D.
  Also the letter \u201Cf\u201D with its descender is untypical for a common grotesque
  and grabs into the following leading. Furthermore I focussed on the interaction
  between regular and the italic styles. In contrary to a common sans serif the italic
  of Mevum has a 18\xB0 angle (a contemporary italic has usually a 8\xB0 angle). Therefore
  the italic expresses a own rhythm and character as the regular. So both\u2014regular
  and italic\u2014keep their own characteristic texture in running text. I wanted
  to give the user the opportunity to discover the Mevum. Besides the distinctiv diagonal
  bar on m, n, p, d there are tiny details such as the truncated corners on the end
  of the stems or the form of the serifs on top left on letters like B, D, P and R
  which become especially visible in large textsizes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mevum_grotesque_textfont_sample_3455.jpg]\r\n\r\nFull

  body: "@ hrant:  \r\nThanks for your feedback, glad you like it!\r\nI try to constitute
    a really high contrast in texture between regular and italic. In my opinion, common
    contemporary italics in sans-serif families are more \"untended\" as in classic
    typefaces, like e.g. a Adobe-Garamond-Italic. And I have considered that such
    classic italics have generally a tighter spacing, probably to keep the typical
    flow in an italic.\r\nAnd thank\u2019s to point out the broken link =)\r\n\r\n@
    J Weltin: \r\nGood idea! BTW next Olympia will surely come."
