  cap \u201CR\u201D is not. Any thoughts? Please advise. Thanks all! "

    sleep to provide the sample. Re: @sans sleep, it almost similar but the weight
    and \u201CA\u201D \u201CR\u201D is different. I doubt its in custom font. Any
    thoughts? Many thanks."

  body: Au contraire, it's almost certainly a custom font. That's how big publications
    like Vogue roll. Sometimes these typefaces become more widely available once a
    period of exclusivity elapses (see Terminal Design's VF Sans, recently the sole
    province of Vanity Fair).
