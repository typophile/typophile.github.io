body: "The preliminary remark is that I'm reading Giovanni Mardersteig's \"Officina
  Bodoni\", a great book about the work of one of the best printer of XX century.\r\n\r\nI'm
  fascinated not only by his excellent typographic work but also by his interpretation
  of the late 1400 aldine types by Francesco Griffo, namely Griffo and Zeno (and lately
  Dante).\r\n\r\nWhat struck me is Mardersteig attempt to differentiate his typefaces
  from Monotype's contemporary metal renditions of the same sources - Centaur and
  Bembo. Looking at the samples of Zeno and Griffo, I have the impression that these
  typeface, compared to Monotypes', have a stronger calligraphic quality, which makes
  them, apparently, not only more faithful to the originals, but much more pleasing
  to the eye (though this is a subjective matter, of course).\r\n\r\nWhere does this
  calligraphic touch comes from? Why do the shapes of Centaur and Bembo, compared
  to Zeno and Griffo, look more mechanical? Why do Mardersteig's types - cut by the
  great Charles Malin - appear so softer, gentler, as they were drawn by a human hand
  and not cut into punches? Do the fact that they were meant for hand composing (and
  not for machine composing) influence this?\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, a question to every
  type designer: how much calligraphy influence your work when designing a type? Do
  you draw it by hand and then transfer it to a digital form, or do you straitghly
  draw it, in a software?\r\n\r\n(Sample from Zeno courtesy of an image posted by
  Hrant, from Mardersteig's book; sample from Bembo from an original Monotype specimen
  from the Bixler press).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zeno_mardersteig_5446.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bembo_monotype_4235.jpg]"
