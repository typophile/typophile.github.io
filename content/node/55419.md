body: "I've been going through all my pictures from the last week. It's been a pretty
  hectic one. Lundi and Mardi Gras at the beginning of the week, then a quick voyage
  to Santa Clara for a conference entirely unrelated to design, but still entirely
  beneficial for the purpose.\r\n\r\nHere's a picture to sum up Lundi Gras:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Carol_MaryAnn_3436.jpg]\r\nMeet
  Carol and Mary Ann, in the letterforms \"Y\" and \"L.\"\r\nWe met them before Proteus
  and Orpheus, after sitting around at the same spot on St. Charles between Napoleon
  and General Pershing (streets). They asked to share our spot, and since it was two
  of us and four of them (plus husbands) we didn't mind at all (there was lots of
  room, and while they don't look it, they're really unobtrusive) and they shared
  brie and gouda with crackers, spinach dip, and errands for poor Corey to run (sending
  him to fetch cigarettes from their husbands who were seated away from the mayhem,
  for example, or getting free Red Bull from the Red Bull girls). We didn't ask about
  the marijuana beads; they didn't question my assignment to take pictures of outfits
  with letterforms. They were, in fact, very enthusiastic about my mission to document
  typographic costumes. Here's what we found:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Letter_J_Cape_4042.jpg]\r\nLetter
  \"J\" as demonstrated by a knight...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Flambeaux_Ts_3967.jpg]\r\nLetter
  \"T\" in the lower case...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P_Drums_4176.jpg]\r\nA
  P or two... I cheated and took this one on Mardi Gras... But it still counts as
  a parade picture, and there were lots of these marching in all the parades...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bead_Jacket_4411.jpg]\r\nThis
  struck me as being letter \"Y\" esque. Most of the letterforms I snapped involved
  negative/positive space relations more than anything else, but lucky for me Carol
  and Mary Ann had keen eyes. They yelled at me to take pictures of a helicopter,
  pointed out the backs of trucks, and recruited innocent bystanders to bend themselves
  into alphabet shapes.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bead_Jacket2_5915.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  guess there's a little bit of graphic design in all of us. Perhaps I've inspired
  for them a new calling..."
