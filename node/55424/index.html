  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m a bit of an idiot and am looking at getting my freelancing feet wet in the very near future. I am wondering if anyone may have some resource suggestions regarding both the average, going rates of design these days, as well as something on turnaround time, be they good books, websites or anything in-between. I have never worked an official design job, don&rsquo;t have any designer friends and the few projects I have done in the past have been for people I know well, so worked pro bono or very, very cheap, and deadlines were never very strict, giving me the luxury of taking the scenic route: I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to tell a stranger who needs a logo or tri-fold how much it would be, nor when they would have it by.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;ve seen some books on the shelves that may cover some of this information, but whenever I&rsquo;ve had money for a book I&rsquo;d buy the pretty ones with lots of slick pictures of different work, never the one that could maybe help me on my way, oh, no, of course not. Well, it&rsquo;s time that changed, so if you may know of one in particular that&rsquo;d be a great help – and start.</p>
<p>regards,
Matthew</p>

You aren’t going to get many people to respond with their own hourly or per-project rates in a web forum (for legal, ethical, and competitive reason) and because prices vary wildly by locale, your best bet is to make friends with some local designers who can advise you.</div>

<li>Estimate the number of hours it&rsquo;ll take for me to complete that job
-This takes some time to get right if you&rsquo;ve never really paid much attention to it.</li>
<li>Multiply that by my hourly rate*</li>
<li>Gave a &lsquo;promotional discount&rsquo; if it was my first project with the client.</li>
