body: 'Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>We were asked to produce a book that shows off  <BR>our
  capabilities. Total creative freedom! The horror... <BR> <BR>The basic idea is that
  all five designers in our  <BR>studio collaborate on a book that tells the story  <BR>of
  &#39;Beautiful&#39;, a kind of legend-like tale. Each  <BR>one of us gets two spreads,
  and a &#39;transfer page&#39;  <BR>preceding your section that incorporates an  <BR>element
  from the designer of the previous spreads  <BR>and another &#39;transfer page&#39;
  to hand over an  <BR>element from your pages to the designer of the  <BR>following
  spreads. <BR> <BR>This is my first spread. At this point in the story  <BR>&#39;Beautiful&#39;
  has just met the first &#39;Ugly&#39; and starts to  <BR>feel very ill. It gets
  from bad to worse throughout  <BR>the page. <BR> <BR>Let me know what you think.
  I&#39;ll provide additional  <BR>information if need be. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10929.jpg"

  body: Hey there. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately I can&#39;t read the words, which would
    help in my understanding.   <BR> <BR>First off, my initial reaction to the type
    was enjoyment and interest, except for the type at the bottom, which is wavy and
    slightly dated looking.    I just don&#39;t like the wavy vector path type elements.  The
    type up top and before this is fine.  Your use of the letterforms of the different
    fonts is engaging. <BR> <BR>Now, in terms of concept.  I am not seeing it that
    much.  What/where is beautiful in this piece?  The &#34;nervous&#34; man?  The
    brain ties into your concept I will say, it looks like it is ill...hungover <IMG

    <BR> <BR>But I am not seeing the beauty here. <BR> <BR>Ciao!

  body: 'I must say I&#39;m not entirely sure about the bottom  <BR>type treatment:
    that&#39;s where he starts to get  <BR>feverish, so I wanted to invoke an atmosphere
    of  <BR>halucination. It&#39;s not a path treatment though &#40;I  <BR>hate those
    too&#41;, it&#39;s all done by hand with a  <BR>photocopy machine. The ole&#39;
    Terry Jones routine. <BR> <BR>With this piece I pay tribute to my influences from  <BR>my
    Art Academy days: 90s deconstructivism and  <BR>neo-goth. So it could be slightly
    dated looking,  <BR>but I hope to add a contemporary twist. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    try to whup up a rough translation. It won&#39;t  <BR>be easy because there&#39;s
    a lot of word play and  <BR>poetic license, but I agree it would help to make  <BR>sense
    of the piece. Gimme till tomorrow. <BR> <BR>BTW There&#39;s no &#39;beautiful&#39;
    in my spreads: it got  <BR>lost in the previous double page. ;&#41; The images  <BR>are
    not meant to be taken literally.'

  body: '&#62; photocopy effect <BR> <BR>I can appreciate you doing this much more
    than I can simply putting type on a path. &#40;In this instance&#41; But, it seems
    there is too much separation. Between the horizontal and the curved. The visual
    play with scale and type is much more interesting, although with more of a mixture
    or transition &#40;segue&#41; from the one to the other it could also still work.  Perhaps
    you transition from the well-set type to the spastic too?  <BR> <BR>The large
    square skeleton is too heavy and seems to weigh [edit] that side down without
    purpose. <BR> <BR>I was reading into the images. The whole, &#34;beauty is only
    skin deep, but ugly goes to the bone&#34; thought came to me. <BR> <BR>the starkness
    of your type, black and white, matches &#40;for me&#41; the starkness of the line
    drawing. But, it doesn&#39;t seem to work &#40;for me&#41; with the photo. <BR>
    <BR>Granted. A lot depends on what precedes and what follows. It could be that
    those spreads set the pace and follow the lead of this spread.  <BR> <BR><IMG

  body: I agree the transition is too abrupt as it is now,  <BR>but I wanted some
    extra input before deciding which  <BR>way to go. <BR>Actually I was going to
    segue the large compositions  <BR>into the curved/distorted type by slightly distorting  <BR>the
    former, but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to do it  <BR>because for the moment I
    quite like the crispness of  <BR>the clusters. <BR> <BR>BTW Which type families
    did I use? ;&#41; Let me have it,  <BR>Tiff! <BR> <BR>I thought I had the pictorial
    elements balanced out,  <BR>but I&#39;ll reconsider the square x-ray pic.

  body: '<i>A lot depends on what precedes and what follows.</i> <BR> <BR>The spreads
    are meant to function as independent  <BR>units: there&#39;s no connection in
    terms of graphic  <BR>design nor typography between the spreads of the  <BR>different
    designers. That&#39;s why we introduced the  <BR>&#39;transfer pages&#39; to unify
    the whole. We all have  <BR>quite different styles, and this book is meant to  <BR>show
    off the diversity of our studio.'

  body: Some gararmond? some not caslon? <BR> <BR>how about more of a woven look?
    picture a braid &#40;plaited hair&#41; at the top it is perfect still, but as
    you undo the ribbon at the end it start to fall, blend, mix...chaos. <BR> <BR>i&#39;m
    still thinking you don&#39;t need the extra. i would focus on the type. i do like
    the skeletal drawing though. but i think that is because the line quality seems
    to work with the type, as if you are mimicking the pattern made by the blood veins
    with the type. <BR> <BR>that&#39;s not itc garamond, is it?? =P
