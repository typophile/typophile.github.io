It sits on a chair by my desk because I feared for my cheap shelf &#40;which bowed mightily under its weight&#41;... For those not products of the fine American education system, the multi-lingual aspect must be pretty helpful. Hell of a reference book, though hardly one you could just sit down and read &#40;in bed or the bath&#41;!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"> &#34;Typology&#34; is a good book for a quick visual coverage on the history of type. I find that I use it more for inspirational and less for historical purposes. --- In fact, all of the books by Stephen Heller and Louise Fili are useful for this purpose. --- Used in conjunction with books that are more academic they can serve as very useful for visual reference. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> i agree. typology is a good jumping off point. it covers different periods and movements, but doesn&#39;t provide intricate detail. surely you need to know something more specific than &#34;the history of serif type.&#34; what about it? just general info or do you need to go deeper than that? </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Hi Isaac <BR>It&#39;s nice talking to you. Thanks for the opinion about the book.  <BR>Actually I need to do a work for my pos graduation about &#34;the typograph on Vogue magazine&#34;. They use three but I will study two. Didot and Garamond. So, I think that is very important to know about the history of both, of serif type and all about typograph. What do you think? I must study another subject or what? What book I should read to find good informations? <BR>Iforgot to say that my work, or my problem is to realise if this two fonts &#34;say&#34; the same things that the magazine. We know that is a fashion magazine but the project was done well with this fonts?? This is what I must do. <BR>Can you or anybody help me?? Anything!? </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> I dont know if I have aread told but I&#39;m from Brasil. Now a days this two fonts make part of this magazine. I will make a research about who created Didot &#40;Firmin Didot&#41; and talk about Neoclassicismo &#40; I dont know how can I call this in inglish &#41;, and Napoleao Bonaparte and French revolution. I beleave that everything that &#34;come to life&#34; has a reason and carry a lot of situations and experiense n the &#34;backstage&#34;. Than I will make a comparison with the days that we live, the period in art history and the culture that we live in. <BR>And the same with Garamond <BR>I dont know if I was clear but a hope that my english dont interfear in my communications with you. <BR>No, I haven&#39;t write nothing until now. I&#39;m in a project time. Last week I handed over to my teacher as a text. Next year I will start actually. <BR>But I swear that I will send you, ok Tiffany? <BR>Thanks so much. <BR>Do you have some to ask me or to help? <BR>Do you read some book that will be very important to me?? <BR>God bless you!!! </div>
