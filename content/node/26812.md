body: What is the proper way to release a revival of a classic typeface, ethically,
  legally? <BR> <BR>I could scan and trace a type from some old prints and use my
  taste and skill to make it better suit todays technology or more true to the original,
  and add some glyphs missing from the previous digital versions. <BR> <BR>To avoid
  legal trouble, do I need to have an agreement with a company holding the rights
  to the font/font name to release it with the historically proper name, or is it
  enough if I add my three initials in front of it? Or should I just come up with
  a new name and if so, can I openly state that this is a revival of the font better
  known as...? <BR> <BR>And how about the copyright of font designs, do they have
  better protection here in Europe than in the US? difference? How does hundreds of
  years old classic typefaces fit the copyright scene, are they just owned by big
  companies? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Timo

  body: Yes, I know my questions are very general, but the answers are scattered all
    over the world. I wonder if there are good books on the subject? <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for the link, it takes time to digest it. I have been thinkin similar categories
    once. I think it&#39;s also important to mention what served as a model for the
    revival. prints, punches, films... <BR> <BR>I think i have registered, just can&#39;t
    remember my password. <BR> <BR>Timo
