  body: This may be the first instance I've seen in which Antique Olive actually looks
    fairly contemporary. I guess all lowercase and tight spacing can do that.

  body: "> <cite>i just don\u2019t get some designers... this is nice, but why use
    antique olive for this job?</cite>\r\n\r\ngood question. \r\n\r\nthe logo was
    designed in the early 80s. Below is a version from ~1984.\r\n\r\nOdwalla was originally
    based in Half Moon Bay. (population then, guessing less than 10,000)\r\n\r\n<cite>Odwalla
    began in Santa Cruz in 1980 with three friends, a used $200 hand juicer and a
    few boxes of oranges. Greg Steltenpohl, Gerry Percy and Bonnie Bassett squeezed
    the juice in a shed behind their home then delivered it to local restaurants.
    One box of oranges was used the first day. Profits from that day bought two boxes
    of oranges the next day marking the beginning of Odwalla.</cite>\r\n\r\n\r\nso
    some factors to consider:\r\n\r\n1) there wasn't DTP\r\n\r\n2) tight tracking
    of typefaces was probably still considered <cite>happening.</cite>\r\n\r\n3) the
    three founders were probably moving at a fast pace, and took something from a
    local designer without much thought. \r\n\r\njust speculating. :D\r\n\r\nbut i
    think the logo has stood up well over time. \r\n\r\nAs for the gloss and stuff,
    it could be any current designer working for Coca Cola. And for some reason, they
    haven't redesigned, even after some deadly <cite>E.coli</cite>  outbreaks and
    other bad PR.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odwalla\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ImageAgentProxy_4444.gif]"
