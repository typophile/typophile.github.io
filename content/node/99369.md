body: " It seems the marketing of fonts has recently taken a rather ugly direction,
  with 90 or 8o% discounts becoming usual for newly released fonts. Ugly, I dare say,
  because it just devalues it too much. Basically, so it seems, it's just a way to
  get your fonts into the temporary-bestsellerlists, which generates more sales. I've
  always been inerested in marketing in general, (this includes commercials, but also
  pricing, distr. etc.) so I was wondering about some interesting ways of marketing
  fonts. Underneath is a decent start:\r\n\r\nFor example, I know that House Industries
  make beautiful products and artpieces using their fonts. Check this! http://www.houseind.com/objects/objects/\r\n\r\nThere
  are some promotional videos: for the Soho fontfamily here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naBDGHYORH8
  and for Gira here: http://vimeo.com/45750412\r\n\r\nThen there's this beautiful
  video (not intentional marketing, but what the heck) on akzidenz: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtvq46zafOk\r\n\r\nSome
  foundries (exljbris) offer a single style for free, and the rest for a reasonable
  price. Also interesting marketing.\r\n\r\nWilliam's Caslon got a beautiful article
  about it here: http://ilovetypography.com/2010/07/26/reviving-caslon-the-snare-of-authenticity/\r\n\r\nSo,
  what else is out there? That's what I'm wondering.\r\n\r\nCheers! jasper"

  body: "Jasper, I'm interested in these ideas also. But I want to take a different
    view. What you mentioned is good, assuming that people interested in type are
    going to hit your website. But what if the seller is an little-known type designer,
    with no web-site traffic? This brings up the real guts of marketing--identifying
    potential customers and then reaching out to them.\r\nSo who are the buyers of
    type? Is this information available? Hey, we're in the age of big data! Here are
    some parties that might buy type: book publishers, magazine publishers, newspaper
    publishers, self-publishing authors, tech writers and tech companies, in-house
    design departments, graphic design companies, independent graphic designers, book
    designers, typesetters, newsletter publishers, commercial writers, web designers,
    and so on. If you knew who was buying type, then you could reach out and say hello.
    Maybe through social media, or through a printed letter (in a stamped envelope),
    or in some other way. But I don't think that marketing, for the little guy, is
    about waiting for people to hit your website. It's about identifying an audience
    and communicating as directly as possible with them. Is this being done? That's
    what I would like to hear about."

  body: "Interesting. I would argue that giving fonts away for free devalues the work
    more than even a 99% discount. At least the customer pays something to appreciate
    the work, as opposed to perpetrating and reinforcing the myth that fonts are free.\r\n\r\nNot
    criticizing Jos or others at all. Do what works for you, but beware the long term
    implications. Just an observation."

  body: "@J. Tillman. Agreed it would be interesting to have figures on which sectors
    buy how many fonts, and perhaps also what kind of fonts.\r\n\r\nJudging from the
    live sales map on myfonts.com, it seems sales are literally spread out over the
    globe. Most are sold in Europe, then the US, South America, and a surprising amount
    in India. What I'm trying t say is, it's hard to 'reach out and say hello' to
    an audience all over the globe...\r\n\r\n@Jeremy: Remember it's just one weight.
    The entire family comes out more expensive when you give one for free, compared
    to a 90% discount, I'd say. Plus, there's something to say for allowing designers
    to use and test the font in any environment before paying for the rest of the
    family."

  body: The current trend of massive opening discounts is annoying to say the least.
    Many who wouldn't normally discount so much have been forced to in order to be
    seen. It seems that font buyers will buy <cite>anything</cite> if it's cheap enough
    (or at least appears to be cheap enough). I might make my next font several thousand
    dollars and put a 99% discount on it :)

  body: "@Jasper I respectfully disagree; I doubt very much that many that download
    the free version upgrade to the full family. This causes the consumer to assume
    that the product, and therefor all fonts have no value, since he did not exchange
    anything for it.\r\n\r\nI have some limited experience with this, and this was
    my observation, but obviously I cannot speak for all.\r\n\r\nThe discounts are
    interesting since I thought the value consumer (freelancers) was annihilated during
    2008-, replaced by the big companies, but that may not be the case, hence the
    discounts."

    best-seller lists is tantamount to free advertising.

  body: The boost in sales you get at MyFonts for being in Rising Stars is incredible,
    which explains how they can charge so much for being a sponsored font (incidentally,
    this is one marketing strategy not mentioned above). I believe it's only a matter
    of time before the MyFonts team start taking into account massive introductory
    discounts and featuring more 'worthy' entries. That's purely speculation, but
    they did mention in the Best of 2012 newsletter that they'd weighed up font sales
    <cite>correcting for what we might call the Introduction Sales Peak (ISP)</cite>
    in order to get the list. They also limited it to two families per foundry, which
    I guess went some way towards stopping it being a Yellow Design Studio advertisement!
