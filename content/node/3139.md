body: Ok, so I have come about some credit at FontFont. <BR>Some of you may know how.
  <BR> <BR>Im looking to pickup a versitile sans face. <BR>I want something that I
  can make good use of. <BR>It needs to be something with chracter, but not overly
  mannered. Something that would work well for a text face. Hopefully with a &#39;pro&#39;
  set. SC OSF and the such. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been wanting to pick up Scala Sans for
  some time now. Is this the time? <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

  body: But some people pronounce that &#34;gay-lah&#34;.  :-/ <BR> <BR>Since the
    name comes from an opera house in Milan, I&#39;d pronounce it &#34;SCAH-lah&#34;.
    On the other hand, I pronounce Officina with a &#34;tch&#34; &#40;since it&#39;s
    [also] of Italian origin&#41;, but its creator &#40;Spiekermann&#41; pronounces
    it with an &#34;s&#34;! <BR> <BR>Kyle, Scala is certainly versatile, of character,
    and texty. But it&#39;s also too ubiquitous. I&#39;d go for something less used,
    like Eureka Sans, Profile, Quadraat Sans, or maybe even Karbid. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Quadraat Sans, Mmm, goos sugestion. I had admired the Serif, but had nevered
    really paid much attention to the Sans. Reminds me a bit of Unger&#39;s work.
