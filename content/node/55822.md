    mean that <em>every</em> type has to come from them. Didot isn\u2019t even close.\r\n\r\ncold

  body: "@Jan\r\n\r\nThanks for correcting.:)\r\n\r\nAs I just said in the first reply,
    \"Cold war kids seems to be set in HTF Didot...\". It was just my guess. And I
    was just trying to help others with useful information (sometimes, some information
    might not be typographically correct from me). I'm glad you offered great message.
    In fact, I'm  neither a type designer nor typography expert. I'm still learning
    about typography.\r\n\r\nJZ"

    means we could be missing thousands of photo-typefaces that never made it to digital
    form. I suspect that's why we can't find these.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
