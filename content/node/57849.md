  me to another question, how can I get better at it?\r\n\r\nBut the real question
  is, if you please, what do I need to fix in this attachment. (this is about the
  real size, maybe a little smaller)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-3_3859.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  feel like photography is a little too tight...\r\n\r\nperhaps it will help to see
  this scaled up much larger:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4475.gif]"

  body: '<em>Photography</em> looks OK to me, but try tightening up on both sides
    of the ampersand. If the rest of the word spaces look big after you do that, you
    might end up tightening them a little bit too. '

  body: I think at that small size you could use a little more breathing room overall,
    maybe particularly in the upright first line.

  body: I think the "Evan Brogan" needs some spacing here and there. Since this is
    a fairly old post. Is it still relevant to add.

  body: The italic has the illusion overall of being looser than the roman text. Tighten
    up around the ampersand. Too loose between the o and g in Photography. Keep wordspace
    consistent.
