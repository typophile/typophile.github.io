  body: "When I teach Type 2 (which I should call \"Book Typography,\" but the school
    won't let me) at an arts college, I give them a pop quiz on world history about
    the 3rd class session. It has about 17 events from about 600 C.E. to the present.
    The students are to place them in chronological order and then they are to note
    the implications these events had on visual culture.\r\n\r\nGood Lord, do they
    hate this exercise. They say \"we're design students, not history students.\"
    I respond that the two are not to be separated.\r\n\r\nTo perhaps ease the pain
    a bit I include \"instructor's birth\" and \"student's birth.\" No one has attributed
    anything of importance to my birth, which is fine and accurate. I have gotten
    some pleasingly egocentric predictions of student accomplishments. After the quizzes
    have been passed back to me and we begin to discuss them, I note that anyone who
    places my birth earlier than it is will automatically fail the quiz.\r\n\r\npowers"
