  default 256 I am used to, I need a program like In Design. I am curious does it
  have the same \"save as\" functions as PS, or do you have to import your layout
  back to PS to view things like results of .jpg compression choices?\r\n\r\nWhat
  brought this on was after viewing Paul Hunt's new <strong ><a target=\"_blank\"

  fonts, I am burdened with an urgent feeling that I will soon need to start thinking
  up a series of excuses to explain to my wife why I need In Design. Not to mention
  the sale price of both sets. This will be one of my hardest sales ever, so any additional
  excuses, gladly accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: If you plan on doing anything beyond image editing, Photoshop isn't the appropriate
    application to use. That should be the only excuse that you need, but I'm sure
    that people will be able to provide you with lots of good ones anyway. As for
    the first part of your question, I will leave that to someone that knows that
    they're talking about.

  body: "I'm not quite sure what you're planning re:\"results of jpeg compression\";
    using inDesign to create jpegs is kinda like banging on a  screwdriver with a
    hammer to chisel out some wood; it works, but a chisel would do a much better
    job. \r\n\r\nInDesign does have an export to jpeg function, but it's not very
    robust: I haven't found any way to make the export anything other than 72 dpi.
    If I need a bitmapped version of something I've done in InDy, I usually export
    it as a pdf, then I open the pdf with Photoshop. That way I get much more flexibility.\r\n\r\nIllustrator
    does OT, and has stronger jpeg export functionality. (I think it's cheaper than
    InDy, too.) Depending on what you are intending to create, it might be something
    to look into.\r\n\r\nJay\r\n"

    that use the OT extended characters? Or does it have to be CS?

  body: "Upgrade Illustrator from 9 (it seems) to CS2 for $169 US. It's as OpenType
    savvy as InDesign.\r\n\r\nIllustrator might be of much interest to you. The fonts
    you play with all live in an outline format; Illustrator is all about outlines,
    the same kind as those used in FontLab and Fontographer. So you might end up gaining
    a lot of functionality for a small investment. \r\n\r\n"

    to set more than a few words in! it rasters type, and that is something you dont
    want if you want to print anything.\r\n\r\nillustrator is to do create (i wrote
    \"raster\" here, which is totally wrong, as it is a vector-programm, didnt have
    much time when i posted) illustrations or documents with only one page.\r\n\r\nindesign
    is to create documents with one or more pages, with great options and many time-saving
    things (like nested formats, etc..).\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nlets say it that way:
    setting text in photoshop is like reading disney-comics instead of a literature
    classic - it has a function, it works well, but its just not the same and shouldnt
    be used for the same things."

    If you're serious about working w/fonts you need InDy. Nuff said.

    probably get In Design. But knowing there is a trial version is comforting. Thanks.

    Photoshop 6/7 support a couple of OT features.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to know which
