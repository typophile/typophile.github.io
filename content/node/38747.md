body: "Greetings! I am new to this site, and am glad it popped up in a search for
  \"rules of typography.\"\r\n\r\nA newspaper from my hometown has now designed their
  online obituaries with the person's name set in a large, bold, sans-serif font in
  RED. I am aggrevated every time I read that page, and have decided that the reason
  goes way back to the \"rule\" that one never uses red type when designing for doctors,
  dentists, medical things, etc. The page may be viewed at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=167&TM=53335.12\r\n\r\n
  I'd like feedback on this issue, please. I appreciate it."

    been exposed to it), and I think I can see why this may be aggravating, the use
    of red for those headlines is consistent with the rest of the site's design -
    all articles have headings that are red.\r\n\r\nSpeaking strictly from a usability
    perspective, it would be bad practice to suddenly change the color of the headings/link
    (since those listed obituaries actually link to the individual post), because
    the visitors to the site would have to re-adjust the new color scheme.\r\n\r\nI'm
    certain this wasn't the answer you were hoping for, but I hope it helps at least
    clarify what the thought process behind the decision might have been."

    that's why.\r\n\r\n>I am aggrevated every time I read that page, and have decided

    with you, this does not fit. Especially in this brutish, bold Verdana style. \r\nBut
    what to do \u2013 changing the font color for ALL links is the possibility or
    remain \"red\". Otherwise it's not a good usability, if you just change font color
    for the medical field on this site.\r\n\r\nEdit: panpainter posted nearly the
    same at the time i wrote this.\r\n"

    the Korean superstition where one is not supposed to write names in red ink--that
    red ink was traditionally reserved for writing the names of the dead. I remember
    being told by other children that writing a name in red meant that person would
    die.\r\n\r\nI've heard the actual reason for this taboo is that the First Emperor
    of China reserved the right to have one's name written in red for himself and
    had anyone else who dared to write one's name in red ink put to death."
