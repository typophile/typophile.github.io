  We are integrating our price tags into the entire company system. Unfortunately
  the program is CRAP! Our current tags have a drop shadow, we build them manually
  in Corel. Once we move to the program we cannot add the drop shadow. I posted on
  this forum about embedded drop shadows a few months ago. There were some pretty
  decent fonts. I didn't mind retial script personally. However, not having layers
  you can't have a red face and a black shadow. My boss then asks me to create a font
  for him that does..beacause I'm apparantly Super Man! Not that easy I tell him.
  Then pay someone he tells me. So, again I tell him that to my knowledge it isn't
  that easy because when you create the font it is still just one single layer. You
  can't have multi-layer fonts. But then again...I am by no means an expert. So...can
  you create a font with a red type face and a black drop shadow? I don't think so
  because again it is the design software that allows the attributes to be changes,
  such as drop shadow, colour, etc. Can it be done or am I right on this one?\r\n\r\nThanks!!!"

    You have a couple of options:\r\n\r\n1) Using Fontographer or FontLab, you can
    (fairly) easily create a \"drop shadow\" version of a face - it would take a while,
    but compared to creating a face from scratch, it's easy. Then you would have to
    set your type twice - one text box with the \"normal\" face, and one box (in the
    exact same position) with the \"dropshadow\" face. But this really isn't any easier
    (or better) than simply crating two text boxes with the same font, and offsetting
    the lower one for the shadow.\r\n\r\n2) Some applications (and I doubt that corel
    is one of them) support alternative font types - Motion, for example, uses \"LiveFonts\"
    that can be almost any image/movie you want. FontLab is pushing their new \"Photofont\"
    app and format, which will let you use any bitmap image (with transparency) for
    the characters in a font, and it works with Photoshop.\r\n\r\n3) Doesn't Corel
    support styles? Illustrator, for example, will let you define a style for an object
    (ex: White fill, black stroke, offset grey dropshadow) that you can easily apply/re-use
    to your heart's content."
