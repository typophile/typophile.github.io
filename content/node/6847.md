  dictionary. And I don&#39;t see what wrong with that.... just the people around
  me looked at me like I&#39;m going to plan the next attack &#40; and the guy from
  the bookstore asked me for id&#41;

  body: In the movie <i>Seven,</i> Morgan Freeman&#39;s character says that the government
    tracks people if they check out certain books from public libraries. I don&#39;t
    know if this is true, but I could imagine it. Maybe bookstores would be tied into
    a similar network. <BR> <BR>You probably wouldn&#39;t set off any alarms unless
    you also bought books with Islamicist themes &#40;if such books are even sold
    in American bookstores&#41;, and books on explosive making techniques, et al.
    <BR> <BR>Of course, you might be lauded by the authorities

  body: They must have asked for ID because you used a credit card. BTW, for years
    they didn&#39;t bother doing that, but I&#39;ve noticed now they&#39;ve become
    pretty strict. <BR> <BR>But yeah, in the US you&#39;re not supposed to think anything
    positive about Arabs. So next time buy a Learning Hebrew book at the same time,
    just return it the next day - unless you want to learn Hebrew too, which can certainly
    be very useful over here. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Mistake? Not at all. But you need to know that Arabs have become a persona
    non grata in the US. Why? I think it&#39;s because they&#39;re resisting western
    assimilation, and that&#39;s bad for business. <BR> <BR>hhp
