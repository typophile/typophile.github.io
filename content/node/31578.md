  her is my own, personal, definitive list of faces. I am screwing my eyes wide shut
  for responses.....\r\n\r\nSans serif\r\nHighlander. Legacy Sans. Gill Sans. Bernhard
  Gothic. Futura. Optima\r\n\r\nSerif\r\n\r\nGaramond (Augereau). Galliard CC. LTC
  Goudy Oldstyle. LTC Kennerley.Plantin. Bembo Book (that new version of the abortive
  early digitization, hopefully consigned to the dustbin or the Museum of Horror Faces),
  Zapf Renaissance, Baskerville 1757. Walbaum (Storm).\r\n\r\nYes, of course, I love
  others, but these are the ones I feel I have to have in my library. "

  body: "San Serif\r\nYou may find this hard to believe - but I could not live without
    Helvetica. All weights, condensed, extended... I just couldn't. \r\nI love Today,
    Formata and Fruitger. Lately, I've been impressed what DIN can do. And I tend
    to you a lot of Classico URW (It has more weights then what the big manufacturers
    sell for Optima - and you can get 3 to 5 more characters on the line in the same
    point size.)\r\n\r\nSerif\r\nTough call - there are so many beautiful ones - but
    my #1 will always be Goudy. I just love that face and it's design. Love the little
    diamond bullets and punctuation (the real stuff guys - not what Linotype, Adobe.
    etc. did to it). It's old but always so fresh.\r\nOne's I need for the Westerns
    I do - are Slab Serifs mostly. Lubalin, Memphis but also Claredon and oh my, Cheltenham
    and Garamond. None of those are my favorites, but I'd lose a lot of work if I
    didn't have them. (Also Eurostile, but that's san serif - and as you can see -
    I won't mention it as one I can't live without.)\r\n\r\nScripts\r\nI have really
    come to love the American Script-type that Rob Leuschke has developed. They are
    beautiful. I wish I could afford them all. I even entered his contest to name
    the latest one last year... hoping... lol. Because of Leuschke - I then became
    familiar with Sudtipos - and they have some very interesting scripts as well -
    especially Ministry. For invitation to a wedding - Stuyvesant still holds up.
    (It was my favorite engraving face when I worked in fine stationery and engraving,
    too many years ago.) I am not fond of formal scripts, because I tend not to need
    any in the design work I receive. However, if I were to keep a few around - I'd
    use Edwardian, BIckham and Snells. (Park, Murray Hill, Commercial -- even French
    - they just don't appeal\r\n\r\nDisplay faces\r\nHouse Industries - I want the
    entire library -- LOL -- okay, for this year and probably next. Great fun faces
    - \r\nThere are many others - but I was always taught to keep an open mind and
    make sure to \"marry\" the type to the artwork. So I wouldn't want to limit myself
    to a few...\r\n\r\nThank you for letting me go on -- of course, these are my personal
    preferences, along with some work ethics -- and... only my opinion.\r\n\r\nLike
    your wardrobe - it depend on how you feel when you get up, or what the occasion
    is to dress for - before you decide on your clothes. Same holds true for type."

    As a game perhaps we can guess from the list of types you present. My first stab...\r\n\r\nYou

      based in Banbury UK. I was a barrister before that. My father, incidentally
      was a practising architect over here, now retired. When working for the LCC
      (London County Council) as it was then called, he designed the lettering for
      our Chelsea Bridge (the one over the Thames).\r\n\r\nAnyway, is my selection
      of faces so antique? i don't know. I prefer to think of them as, well, classics.
      What are your own favourites?? Perhaps I really am out of touch?"

    range of projects, including writing and psychotherapy. If you'd replied that
    you designed rave flyers or video game interfaces then I would have been surprised
    by the tools you'd chosen.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si \r\n"

    body: I forgot one serif from my list, another must have for me. Joanna (designed
      Eric Gill) a wonderful slab serif, that is beautiful and marvellously legible.
