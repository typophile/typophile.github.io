body: "Ladies & Gentlemen,\r\n\r\nI'm a happy user of FontForge under Linux. I'd like
  to try out Adobe's autohinter just for the fun of it. Back in the day, Thomas Phinney
  <a href=\"http://www.thomasphinney.com/2009/01/afdko-25/\">announced</a> it'd be
  available for Windows, Mac and Unix. It seems that this is not true -- at least
  I was only able to find Windows and Mac versions. \r\n\r\nWine allows me to run
  autohintexe, but when passing any files to it (OTF or PFA/AFM) I get error messages
  like <code>\"Error. Illegal command line. Must provide font info file name.\"</code>
  or <code>\"ERROR: Bad file format. Unknown operator: dict in  character.\"</code>\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone ever got this to work, or if I'm doing something totally wrong, I'd be thankful
  if you could share your wisdom!"

  body: From reading the comments in the python files, autohintexe works only on glyphs
    in some "bez" format, there is a Pyhton wrapper AC.py that work on font files,
    which is called by autohint.cmd. With some little effort you can get it to work
    on Linux with wine (I have to add the "win" directory to my PATH, rename all .exe
    files to get rid of the extension, make sure binfmt support is working so windows
    programs can be called directly like native executables) Now it is working and
    I got it to hint a font, but I didn't check if the hinting is correct.

  body: Thanks Khaled! According to the documentation you should be able to simply
    pass it PFA or OTF files. What the 'bez' and 'font info' files are I wasn't able
    to figure out. I'm afraid it's easier for me to ssh into my University's Windows
    account, but I'll keep your comment in mind for further experiments. Too bad Big
    A neglects us again ...

  body: I got the whole FDK to work by using Windows binaries and OSX shell scripts
    with very little modification. I've no use for it though, may be I'll use it to
    "validate" FontForge's feature file implementation.

  body: I'd just like to play with the autohinter, since FontForge's hints seem to
    make Crimson look weak and irregular on prints, unless I'm doing something wrong
    (yes, it's a crappy old laser printer).

    Mac OS X shell and Python scripts, replaced the Mac OS X executable files with
    shell scripts that call the Windows executables though wine, and there you go.

    and if the model has no Postscript emulation at all bad hints can deform letters
    when the output is converted to PCL. The hints produced by the Adobe autohinter
    work better than others, but in my experience it\u2019s best to just not autohint
    a font until the final step of production."
