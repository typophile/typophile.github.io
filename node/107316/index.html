		<div class="commentbody">Unfortunately there is no true alternative yet. TypeDrawers is a good forum, but it is not meant as a Typophile replacement, since it has a much narrower focus with restrictions concerning content and things like user names. Typedia could have become a vivid typography forum but they closed the forum in 2011. All other typography forums I know of are just sub-forums of design forums. No other (English) site has a similar focus as Typophile.
Based on my experience with running a vivid German typography forum since 2001, I plan to set up an English copy early 2014. It will be a full-fledged community site with all the bells and whistles one would expect from such a site nowadays. So there is hope. :-) 

Still, I am also hoping that all the Typophile discussions will someday be “freed” from the current software and moved somewhere where they can at least be browsed without problems as an archive. </div>

It took longer than anticipated, but my new English online-community around typography is now running. Since there are still a lot of technical problems to fix over the next weeks, it’s currently only available as private beta. If you want to get early access, just write me an email and I will send you login data.

		<div class="commentbody">As far as I'm concerned this website is becoming intolerable and it is almost unusable. 

I have sent emails to tech support re: "Service Temporarily Unavailable" and various other spurious server error messages - all to no avail. Not even the courtesy to respond. 

I am more than willing to contribute to the Typophile forums - if only the server didn't pull the plug on me after a couple of minutes. It has got so bad that the server has been not accepting my password at log in and when I request another the system just freezes, or I get multiple reset links in my inbox. Aaaarrrrrggggggh! from a very annoyed occasional (when it lets me in) user.

This service is frankly outrageous and laying the blame on the "Chinese Hackers" has gone way past a joke. Yeah -right. Please fix it or put it out of it's misery!

P.S. Just so you realise that I do know what I'm talking about regarding support, let me state:- In association with my business partner (cyclone systems.co.uk) we supply internet web hosting services via our www.cylonet.com site with guaranteed 24x7x365 server support service included. If we supplied a service that was marginally as poor this one is - we would be out of the game!</div>

I doubt he reads his Typophile mail anymore, but he has personal accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn, and perhaps other social media too. I won't post addresses, but just search for Jared Benson Typophile Punchcut.

I'm NOT advocating hassling him, we appreciate all he's done over the years, but just sending civil messages explaining how we feel about Typophile's dismal condition and asking that he either fix it or let someone else run it.</div>

In two and a half weeks I will start my round the world tour (two weeks plus in Australia, starting with Sydney, then on to San Francisco and New York), and considering the attention needed to plan that, and the dearth of web access while en route, I won't log in here until the end of January. Except for some tips on what to visit in the places mentioned, of course : )

		<div class="commentbody">Has anyone considered starting up a StackOverflow forum for fonts shop talk?

As a noob to type design, and as someone who only dabbles once or twice a year in typography creation/design, I find that it's nearly impossible to find good resource online when I have questions.

With that said, I think a stack exchange type forum would be awesome.

Here's the place to start:

http://area51.stackexchange.com/

When I search for "typography", only the graphic design site comes up.

Anyone around here think Typography would be a good idea for a stack site?</div>

I believe the same holds true, still, for Hrant P. 

Actually it's worked out great being forced to remain just a fly on the wall with the impulse to contribute squelched.
Puckett can go fly a kite. And my standards are too high to post on a forum that would have me as a participant, anyway.  ;)

I've been posting on the Google Fonts Discussion Group. 
And I've revived my blog Readableweb after over a year of inactivity.
And, for the first time since getting involved with the actual production of fonts, I'm making some money doing it. 
Perhaps there's a correlation with not being able to post on Typedrawers. If I shut up entirely, I might really make a bundle.

BTW - I haven't looked, but I'm  assuming the Wayback machine site keeps copies of this site.
 A possible source in case this forum completely bites the dust.

Which is legitimate of course. A website is a private endeavor and a private “space”. The owner doesn’t have to tolerate anything, he/she doesn’t want. But in my experience, if you actively moderate a forum in accordance to clear rules, you hardly ever need to ban anyone.  
In this spirit the new Typography.Guru forums are also open to anyone: http://typography.guru/forums/
Anyone can register, including Hrant and Richard. ;-)

The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/typography/">typography subreddit</a> on Reddit.com also seems very busy at the moment, although the crowd and discussions there seem to be very different than on Typophile or Typedrawers. </div>
