  by project (not by per hour). Charging by per hour are just minor changes. We cant
  keep track by charging the whole idea and design by per hour nor by per page. The
  book size is 280(h)x280(w)mm and pagination from  200-250pgs with hard cover. \r\n\r\nContent
  for Quotation and how much:\r\n1. Proposal on Concept Approach\r\n2. Consultation
  on Concept\r\n3. Design layout typography\r\n4. Scan, photoshop, Illustrations/tracings
  graphics, search for stock images\r\n5. Content Editing / Proofreading\r\n\r\nPlease
  do let me know if i missed out anything or whats the best idea.\r\nThank you for
  sharing your knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nregards,\r\nMartin"

  body: "> designing a book by project (not by per hour)....\r\n\r\nI have designed
    a few self-published books for clients, and the prices have varied considerably
    depending on the details of the project and other factors including how easy or
    difficult I thought the client was going to be to work with.\r\n\r\nCharges for
    any design project are based on your time (your hourly fee multiplied by number
    of hours) and expenses. So you need to estimate how many hours you expect the
    project to take. Yes, that can be difficult. If others here suggest specific prices,
    keep in mind that design pricing can vary considerably depending on the details
    of the project, your level of expertise, and the prices other designers charge
    in your area.\r\n\r\n> Proofreading\r\n\r\nEven if you (or a proofreader you hire)
    are proofing the project, be sure to specify in your contract that the CLIENT
    is ultimately responsible for proofreading and signing off on the project before
    it's printed.\r\n"

  body: "Abattis, I'm a graphic designer, not a type designer. But most clients want
    a quote or estimate at the start of the project, so I estimate how many hours
    it'll take and what my expenses will be (photography, illustration, mileage if
    I need to attend meetings, printing if billed to me, etc). Something like this:\r\n\r\nDesign
    \  $x\r\nProduction $x\r\nExpenses (listed individually) $x\r\nRevision #1  $x\r\nRevision
    #2 $x\r\nRevision #3 $x\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\nRevisions are often a significant
    amount of the total, especially in large projects. I just finished a routine project
    for a corporate client that had 5 rounds of revisions; occasionally I've had 8
    or 9 rounds.\r\n\r\nI hate the process of making estimates, but it's part of the
    job. It's much easier when you've done similar projects in the past and can check
    your records to see how long they took."
