body: I'm creating a graphic that will reside on my client's blog. The graphic has
  4 components - each needs to graphically represent one of the  last 4 decades in
  50 x 72 pixel space. I'm having a tough time with the 90's. I'm looking for suggestions
  on how to visually represent the 90's. Grunge perhaps If so, grunge what?

  body: "How about Bill Clinton in a grungy flannel shirt?\r\n\r\nAlthough I think
    that grunge only represents the first 3 years or so of the 1990s. How about the
    dot com boom? Maybe a period and the letters c-o-m? You can always use a grunge
    typeface if it makes you feel better.\r\n\r\nJason C"

    body: I agree from a design standpoint but the effects lasted throughout he decade,
      so it should resonante with the viewers. 0's and 1's and .com in grungier styling
      might work.

      it was intended as a placeholder but the client liked it so we kept it. '

    body: '"ala" indeed. Grunged-up 0''s and 1''s seemed to work. We have preliminary
      approval, so thanks for all your input!'
