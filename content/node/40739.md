body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm currently building a website for myself in HTML and wanted to
  include a .swf file in it. Its a 220x100px, 12k file, basically a logo that slowly
  changes colour. Thing is, when previewing the site the .swf loads just late enough
  to show a white background (site has black background) for a split second before
  loading and running normally.\r\n\r\nIs there anyway around this without resorting
  to a preloader in the beginning?\r\n\r\nHope this wasn't too unclear. Thanks."

  body: "When a SWF is embedded in HTML, you can set its background color, like this
    (assuming you're using the regular <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag):\r\n<code>\r\n&lt;param
    name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\" /&gt;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThis will prevent it
    from showing a white square before the SWF finishes loading.\r\n\r\n-- <a href=\"http://www.omine.net/\">omine.net</a>"

  body: "Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately I can't seem to get it to work. In case
    it matters, its a XHTML site with CSS. I insert the SWF using Dreamweaver/Insert/Media/Flash
    and get the following code:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/code_3739.gif]\r\n\r\nDoes
    it have to be in a specific place within the code? I put it in under the line
    setting the quality."

    between quality="high" and pluginspage= seemed to do the trick.
