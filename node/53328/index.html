  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Many designers love 1001freefonts.com or similar websites to get their hardly unique typefaces that will be used by much more than 1001 different designers. I do not use these typefaces, not because you can't at times find something good, but because I feel like using these fonts is an easy way out. If you want to make something look "evil" it is very easy to get a grungy, distorted typeface and throw it on a dark background and presto! you have your evil look. It takes the skill out of designing. I have a few favorite fonts that I use, and as you can probably assume, Helvetica is one of them. Wim Crouwel said "[A typeface] shouldn't have a meaning in itself, the meaning is in the content of the text, and not in the typeface, and that's why we loved Helvetica very much..." Using a font with too much "emotion" can take away from the overall success of a piece (even if a momentary superficial point is achieved). Now, I know that not all of these fonts are horrible and some briefly distorted fonts can be used to achieve a subtle look, but any designer can distort any font to achieve a completely unique texture and a completely unique effect.


Typography is an art form and a beautiful typeface is something very hard to make and the majority of these free font sites pervert this art and produce mass amounts of drivel. My point, get a high quality font collection like Adobe's Font Folio, find something that stands out to you and if you need a texture then make a texture, if you need a word to look shaky, move the letters to achieve your look.


Don't be a lazy designer. You’ll like your piece much more if you don’t skimp.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">i agree with what you wrote about ready made free fonts and about designers' lazyness, but i disagree on Wim's opinion. 
usualy i love to make my own type when making display healines, but i think that good fonts with a clear emotion and style are a designer's tool of trade.

i disagree with the banal use of helvetica for every kind of job. this bores the hell out of me, and i really think that this is the ultimate designers' lazyness. 

it's like saying:
"I GIVE UP!! from now on its potatoes only!"
while potatoes are good and nutritional, they are not sufficient, and a constant use would make you go berzerk and storm at the nearest grocery store, trying to lick mustard jars in order to stirr up your fading taste senses.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Agreed. Helvetica should not be used. In fact, I've been partial to Serif fonts recently. I think that Sans Serif fonts are chosen by many designers now and even limiting yourself to something like that is, well, limiting.

however, it should not be used for everything.</div>
