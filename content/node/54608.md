    from 1989, set in Monotype Van Dijck 12/13 by Geuze & Co's Drukkerij in Dordrercht,
    the Netherlands.\r\nI tried to google it but couldn't find a web page for the
    company. So either it's gone or some dutch friend here at Typophile could perhaps
    tell us if it's still around.\r\n\r\nThe book is/looks awesome.\r\n\r\n\u0192"
