body: Your critiques appreciated on this one. I'm fond of text faces that manage to
  pull off readability with some unconventional angles and stroke intersections...
  so that's what I'm trying to do here. You can see from some of my sketches that
  I'm visualizing strokes that fold over themselves to create a little tension in
  the curves and make for interesting serifs, feet, etc. This is my first go at a
  text face so let me know if this is moving in the right direction.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lamond_01_6099.png]

  body: "Damn, this is some advanced stuff! First of all, I would like to see a pdf
    with some text samples, instead of jpg. For a textface, the upward serifs on the
    top of all stems are distracting. I can see that they are a main characteristic
    of the typeface, be I would rather have them pointing down. Actually, the same
    goes for your bottom serifs. For better legibility, just flip them horizontally.
    The italic allows you to play more with these concepts, but for a textface some
    of them are a bit too unconventional.\r\n\r\nThat g is redicilously beautiful!\r\nk

    quite liked the cut at the right in the e, but that's just my opinion.\r\nn h
    m u could all go a touch narrower.\r\nI have the tendency to make the crossbars
    in f and t thicker towards the and, so this might just be me, but making it thinner
    towards the end just doesn't look right to me. They look too thin as a whole.\r\nIt
    has cuts in the bottom of the bowl in d, but not in c e. \r\nTry to be a bit more
    rational (not too much!) and think of the actual structure that you're using.
    Looking closely at this (http://cyreal.org/typefaces/florian) picture should show
    you a more rational approach to this idea. The cuts appear at the thinnest part
    of the curve, as they would with a broad-nip pen. Although this is (yet again)
    quite a big change I would at least TRY to place the cuts with broad-nip logic
    in mind, using this picture as a guideline. \r\n\r\nIf you decide to keep the
    cuts the same you should review them all the same. The bottom of the bowl in d,
    looks heavier than the top of n, for example.\r\n\r\nThis typeface would do great
    with short descender/ascenders, following a current trend. This is a stylistic
    choice that you should decide upon though, not me.\r\n\r\nTo be honest I think
    you're moving on to the Italic a bit too fast, so I won't critique that for now.\r\n\r\nKeep

  body: I love the way this is progressing.  I like that it has details which are
    seriously cool when large but it still works well set small.  I disagree with
    Jasper that it's too early to start working on the italic.  Working on them simultaneously
    will help, as one informs the other and it helps keep them harmonious.  One of
    the biggest pitfalls I fall into it getting stuck on one particular font.  I even
    think it helps to be working on a few different typefaces at a time (not just
    weights and styles of the same font).  It stops you getting bored and what you
    learn from one can be applicable in another, nomatter how disparate they may seem...  Although
    this could explain why I have about ten unfinished typefaces languishing in a
    state of perennial limbo!

    not to stray too far into its territory. But good to see how it's done well. I'm
    glad you brought up the b/d/p/q treatment since I felt there was something wrong
    there. I think this revised version sticks to the broad nib rules a bit more.
    Also, I think I've got the stem serifs all behaving similarly. I think. \r\n\r\nQ:
    should the top left of the /a/ get narrower like the bottom-right of the /e/ and
    /c/? I like how it is now but feel it should follow the broad-nib pen rules already
    in place.\r\n\r\nI think I jumped into the italics to just see what it might look
    like. It actually helped me figure out the personality of the roman. As a purely
    informal exercise, I think it helps to inform the designer on other decisions.
    With that said, I'm going to put that aside and work on the numerals now. :)\r\n\r\n<img

  body: "Wow! Great job again. You're a quick learner :-)\r\n\r\nI prefer the first
    /a/, this is really quite a personal choice. Go with what looks most natural,
    disregarding the method behind it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, if you want to get useful
    feedback it would be wise to include a pdf with text at different sizes. I like
    what you've got going on here, and I would like to be able to print it, for better
    judgement.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the funky serif at the top left of n, m,
    u, etc. I like it's quirkyness and it's perfectly understandable if you want to
    keep it, but it might not result in optimal legibillity to keep it this way. If
    you do want to keep it like this, than I suggest you lengthen them only when attached
    to an ascender (b, d, h, k, l, etc.). They don't work at all in the u, but it's
    not terribly bad to use a different structure there.\r\n\r\nDownload the RMX tools
    demo, from Tim Ahrens. Some of your outlines are just a little bit off (positioning
    of nodes, length of control points, etc.). The harmonizer from RMX tools will
    fix this easily, as well help speeden up the production process once you start
    making it into a complete family.\r\n\r\nYou might want to make the bowl of the
    /a/ a bit more diagonal at the top, to match with the top of the /a/ (for both
    the first and the second /a/ in the picture above), but it's not particularly
    wrong the way it is now. I would also suggest to make the middle bar in /a/ thinner,
    as well as the middle bar in /e/. I can see the logic behind it, but it just looks
    a little bit too thick to my eyes.\r\n\r\nI would like the bottom right serif
    in /a d u/ to point up a bit, or maybe even make them into tails.\r\n\r\nThe bottom
    right of e and c ends a bit too low IMO. They should roughly match the bottom
    right of the bowl in d.\r\n\r\nI would like to see the bar in /e/ a bit more straight
    (shorten the part that turns up), like it used to be in earlier versions.\r\n\r\nIt's
    your typeface off coarse, but I hope you carefully considered keeping the ballish
    terminals in /a c f, etc/, instead of just going the Florian way ;-) I quite liked
    those.\r\n\r\nThe bar in f and t should be thicker. Roughly the same thickness
    as the bottom of the bowl in d.\r\n\r\nw is too wide, but I like the structure.\r\n\r\nThe
    gap between the serifs in x, is larger at the top than it is at the bottom. Should
    be the other way around.\r\n\r\nConsider (just CONSIDER) to make the serifs in
    s and z more diagonal.\r\n\r\nr is too wide and the arm looks a little bit off.\r\n\r\nFor
    better legibility, consider (just CONSIDER) a more horizontal ear on the g.\r\n\r\n/C
    D G O Q T/ should be wider IMO.\r\n\r\nThe curves in D should be fuller. Extend
    the control points.\r\n\r\nThe modulation in the bowl of P and R is off. It looks
    as if there's a straight piece (bottom of the bowl) attached to the top of the
    bowl.\r\n\r\nLengthen the tail on Q a bit.\r\n\r\nI would like to see diagonal
    strokes all over in the M, but I must say it's a cool quirk.\r\n\r\n DON NOT TAKE
    ANYTHING I SAY FOR GRANTED. IT'S YOUR TYPEFACE, NOT MINE. If this long comment
    comes across as harsh feedback, it's not. I'm just a perfectionist. You got talent.\r\n\r\nKeep
    going! It'll be worth it :-)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper"

    you want), try to see the inner and outer curve as two different lines. The nodes
    don't have to align, or rather, shouldn't. Try to approach all curves the same
    way. Hope this makes some sense to you."

    thoughts:\r\n<ul> \r\n<li>The inner and outer curve of the <em>n, h, m</em> have
    an urge to work together.</li>\r\n<li>Taper the shoulder of the <em>r</em> and
    push the entire arm a bit to the left. See if that helps. I think the curve of
    the <em>r</em> should be abrupter in matters of contrast. You can also try to
    straighten the curve at the joint (just the upper curve or both) and then gradually
    bend it . When the shoulder joins the stem at an almost collinear angle it needs
    too be lightened to compensate the illusion of the stem swelling. Just to say
    that, whenever possible, try avoiding dark spots.</li>\r\n<li>The <em>r</em> is
    difficult, but it's even more displeasuring to try to draw a smooth arc for the
    <em>U</em>. I detest drawing <em>U</em>s. Its straight-curve transition refuses
    to look good. Work on it. Perhaps you are luckier than me.</li>\r\n<li>The horizontal
    stroke of the <em>t</em> falls as if it was a plank fixed with one single nail.
    Hmm... Take care of that :). The bulk at the bottom of the stem doesn't look organic.
    As for the tail, the round curve from the outside doesn't match the inner crisp,
    straight lines (I'm not saying rounded lines can't match straight and edged ones,
    but in this case it doesn't).</li>\r\n<li>The dot of the <em>i</em> lacks of simplicity.</li>\r\n<li>The
    terminal of the <em>f</em> doesn't look integral, i.e. it is too abrupt.</li>\r\n<li>You
    decided to make the upper horizontal of the <em>Z</em> curved from below (like
    the <em>T</em>). That makes the right side, where it joins the diagonal, too dark.
    Making it straight at the right won't hurt, I think. That should settle what I
    think Jasper ment (maybe after also thinning the horizontals a bit).</li>\r\n<li>The
    spur of the <em>b</em> seems to float over the baseline.</li>\r\n<li>The tail
    of the <em>a</em> is too long.</li>\r\n<li>Flipping over the <em>n</em> to create
    a <em>u</em> may result very practicable. Nevertheless, the arc of the <em>u</em>
    usually starts later, closer to the bottom, producing a more bent curve than that
    of the <em>n</em>.</li>\r\n<li>The ascendent diagonal of the <em>x</em> may need
    subtle tapering.</li>\r\n<li>Add contrast to the <em>e</em>.</li>\r\n<li>Bendy
    knows best about the <em>N</em>.</li>\r\n</li>The upper diagonal of the <em>K</em>
    can be thinner.</li>\r\n</li>The counter of the <em>K</em> is irregular inside.
    You made it straight at the bottom; I like that, but the angle it makes with the
    curve should be sharper if you wan't to distinguish it from the curve. </li>\r\n</li><em>X</em>
    doesn't look balanced </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nPolishing your curves is very important,
    as Jasper stated. After working at your font, take a breath looking at other typefaces
    you like to compensate your visual accustoming to your design. \r\n\r\nFinally,
    it would be great to see samples of running text.\r\n\r\nKeep scrutinizing!"

    colosseum of the critique section, not by accident, but precisely to receive constructive
    and most of all heterogeneous feedback of the work presented. That's critique,
    isn't it? To expose your art to other's opinions ;b. Then, the designer takes
    into account only the ideas which fit best with his/her intention. And then, voil\xE0,
    you make progress!\r\n\r\nI agree with both of you that roughness is a main attribute
    of this font. When I wrote \"polishing\" I didn't want to say smoothen. Surely
    typefaces like Kinesis, Delphin or even Scala were polished although they still
    look rough and informal. Look at their italics! They seem perfectly rough to me
    :)\r\n\r\n<em>Bendy</em>: I work with beziers all the time, and I doubt there
    is something mathematical when using them. The maths stay happily and safe within
    FontLab, and when I use beziers to draw my letters, I really draw them. The actual
    challenge is learning how to use them to get the desired result.\r\n"
