		<div class="commentbody">I've been using a Wacom stylus for almost 20 years, and upgrade when necessary. That is, when the old one which was functioning perfectly well with all the functionality I needed is rendered obsolete by operating system changes; it's part of the feature bloat "conspiracy" to keep milking purchasers by turning them into perpetual clients.

When I had to get the "Intuous" version, it came with a big fat "kiddy" stylus, so I sensed that I was no longer part of the company's main market. Not really a big piss-off now, just a minor inconvenience, as I move up the demographic age categories and become less and less relevant to this kind of product developer.

So yeah, it's a pseudo-60s kitsch kiddy popcult kind of logo, so what. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I would'nt mind also if it was any of the 60s kitsch etc kind of logo you describe.
I do mind however, that like the 2012 logo, yet again, WO have fallen considerably short of basic design standards.

A well constructed 'popcult kind of logo' would have been great.
As 'brandnew' says, they might even have constructed a logo that demonstrates the unique qualities of the product itself.

But instead they design this.

Pity the poor designer who has to incorporate this logo into their next project.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">is this a bit like odvertising. It got people talking, upping the company profile in no time. So maybe not such a bad logo in the mean timeI guess the product is all about fun. The designers are tripping on something. They can remove a few elements and the logo might be kind of normal.

but wait, maybe this awful logo gets 'repaired and retouched' by the wonderful product that is a Wacom tablet, over the coming weeks.

		<div class="commentbody">As David (Nickel) says, <a href="http://global.wacom.com/">the logo bouncing around</a> doesn't help at all. I don't think it is a logo but more of a mascot (Wolff Olins will have given 'it' a name of some sort). It seems to appears on every page of the website but isn't anywhere near the logo.

Anyway, looks like WO have been smart enough to be able to ditch the thing when everyone is sick of it (which shouldn't be too long now).

The new brand appears to incorprate sound too. Listen to the website for a bit and the four notes/chords cast an Oriental spell that will gently send you off to sleep which is fine unless you have a deadline, in which case why are you reading this?

One thing about graphic design, as I often encounter here at work, EVERYONE is a designer, and EVERYONE  is a critic. No matter what you do, some people will love it and some will hate it, and the ones who hate it are usually intensely righteous about thier opinion.

It makes me wonder if Wolff-Olins might not be a front organisation for an epilepsy research institute. I seem to recall that the first Olympics TV spot triggered a number of epileptic siezures, and the way the Wacom logo moves in and out of focus as it bounces around the screen might be a new trigger test.</div>

Sometimes the designer really has no choice.
They have listened to the customer - and have given the customer what they want/expect. Even if the designer has a clearer understanding of customer from a graphics point of view - bottom line is, you give the customer what they want, you get your check, you let it clear the bank - and then you laugh. For there really isn't anything else you can do.

I don't believe that is as true at this level of corporate identity -- designer prestige and corporation prestige -- as it may be on other levels. Few companies the size of Wacom would hire a firm the size of W-O and say, "We already know what we want. Just do it for us." It's antithetical to the process. </div>

We come from the school of 3 choices. We design and turn over the 3 thumbprints. The one they asked for, the throwaway one and the one we are proud we created. 

Many of us try to believe it isn't so... but it is. Especially when the graphic met their expectations. So sorry.

Although it's difficult to judge from the gif, I'd hazard to say that the execution is pretty amateurish. Probably no-one bothered to visually correct the thickness of the horizontal/vertical lines. The curves don't seem to be particularly considered either, actually appearing to break. And it is certainly inspired to turn the 'w' to make an 'm' - not!

And if you look closely, the 'w' optically feels wider than the 'm'. That sort of stuff happens when you pay no attention to detail.

I wholeheartedly agree with these comments, as well as Jackie's statements. I get a bit disappointed with how quick people seem to tear something to shreds. If you've ever had your heart ripped out when a great idea gets killed by a client, you might not be so quick to judge. There's no arguing with the multi-millionaire, billionaire or CEO who's fronting the bill when they want a last minute change. I know many of you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about.

In my experience, clients are usually right, and push creative to do more interesting work than standard "good design".

<em>good design</em>

Is that award-winning good design, or sales-enhancing good design?
Either is difficult to create, both more so.
Non-award-winning "good design" is pretty-boring, and easily trumped by "bad design" in the sales-enhancing department.
For an example close to us all:

		<div class="commentbody"><strong>Biddy: </strong> <em>If you’ve ever had your heart ripped out when a great idea gets killed by a client, you might not be so quick to judge. </em>

Just a quick story for you Biddy - one I think you can empathize with. A dear, departed friend of mine was the art director for trade books at a very well known publishing house - long before there were computers in the bullpen. It was the days when you received lettering from the typographer, that you put together to create a logo type, you sent that off to the photo house for some transfer type of it and demand a C-print. You went out on a photo shoot and spent the wee hours of the morning going through contact sheets before the 9 a.m. publisher's meeting -- having it altogether - as a comp, so the non-design functioning minds could see what the cover of a book may possibly look like.

Well, it had been just such a night, and the next morning, Madame President was having PMS. She was not happy with the design work she saw, and I guess was having a hard time verbalizing it - so she picked up her pen and stabbed his work - not just one time - but 8 holes worth. We had a very long lunch that day -- and soon after he left his place of employment.

Again, real world stories for the folks that just haven't been there - or done that! But Biddy - I know you know that I know that you know exactly what goes on... Nice meeting you fellow graphic arts survivor.

P.S. I would have put this in an I/M to you - but, oops we don't have that anymore. So I guess others can read this too!</div>

Unfortunately, freak outs of this magnitude still exist today. My main point and (I think it has been others)...you can't look at a piece of design and EVER know the blood, sweat and tears that went into the design.

Its very easy to judge from the comfort of a chair and after the work has been done. "Blood, sweat and tears" sounds like a cliché...but for those who haven't done a lot of comps...that term can be quite literal.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think we are getting comfused about the difference in concept and the design.
As is the case with the 2012 logo, I don't think peple are critising the concept here.

I'm certainly not. If WO have done their brand marketing and decided that the best way to represent a graphical hardware company is the sound coming from the trumpet like logo they have designed, who am I/we to argue (you have to visit the wacom website). In fact I think its quite interesting.

What I don't understand is why, like the 2012 logo, basic design skills are'nt being applied to the creation of the logo.
Would it be that difficult for WO to use skilled type people, as Bruno Maag has outlined above, to create some typography that does'nt already look if it is out of date, yet alone something which will prevail into the next decade. WO, is a company that prides itself on thinking differently, I'm not seeing much difference in the just launched compaq logo -  So much for forward thinking 'next level' typography.

On the same basis would it have been that difficult, if they positively must have a 3d logo, to have drawn it without using basic level illustrator filters. At least think for one moment the uses of the product we are talking about here, if nothing else.

It is will some hesitation that I have posted the 21year old Chermeyeff and Geismar NBC logo, I'm bound to have opened a can of worms. However, if only because of the colourful nature of both logos, I thought about this as being a logo that has stood the test of time. C&G would never have known what the future held in terms of digital broadcasting and yet here it is today, still every bit as relevent and stylish as when it was designed in 1986. Not bad for a simple bit of well crafted 2d artwork.

As a design industry are we creating these 3d logos because that is the best solution or simply because technology allows us to do it?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/compaq_3907.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/NBC_6712.jpg]</div>

Then (it was the 70s or 80s - it's a blur now) then changed it to the giant N. They spent a fortune marketing the giant N. They wanted you to recognize it from another planet. 

Long story short - it didn't go over well - and the peacock, modernized, was brought back.

I do wonder who sat around those creative meetings....

Biddy - Blood, Sweat and Tears was a good group - and brings back good memories... :-) Thank you for being here an understanding -- my friend NEVER got over that experience, and now - it's too late for him. It did teach him not to be abused...

It's an infamous story. NBC paid $600,000 for the highly heralded identity. They got hammered with a cease and desist order, plus had to make a $800,000 equipment donation to the Nebraska public TV station who had already developed the exact same mark — for a whopping fee of $100.

I was going to say that Wolff Olins is safe from this comical mark already being in use. But then again, it may turn out that some six year old kid already holds a claim to it.</div>

Yes.
The best example of the "new effects trump old quality" principle I've come across was a quote from Harold Lloyd, the movie comedian. Sound had just been introduced into movies, and his latest silent masterpiece was being ignored at the box office. His comment was along the lines of, "We spent ages making this film, with well thought-out gags, it's one of the best things I've ever done, but people would rather watch a movie of an egg frying in a pan if they can hear it sizzling".</div>

So, the hotmetal type is superior to the handwritten, and the digital type is superior to the metal, and the halographic projection of type will be better than the digital print... each new form rendering its ancestor obsolete (flat, dull, and static).
An interesting conundrum though: torch becomes candle becomes electric light becomes hand cranked flashlight becomes battery flashlight becomes... you know? But what happens when the fad becomes retro, as in the resurgent return of "novel" hand-cranked flashlights, such as are in every store I visit these days? Does the "new" old trump the the "older" new, because of its novelty? I maintain that novelty and quality are vey different things, and further, that quality will survive the battle.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick put it this way: <em>In my experience, clients are usually right, and push creative to do more interesting work than standard “good design”.</em>
this is an important point, and one that deserves repeating. we can trash clients all day, because -- let's face it -- it's nice to have someone to blame. but a client often DOES push us to do better work. the illustrator jim mcmullen and i were discussing this very point years ago when i had just graduated and started doing some high-profile work. he said, "there is nothing like a difficult client to focus your work," and i've carried the thought with me throughout my career. i have to qualify it this way, though: i think the client IS often right, but in many cases doesn't have any idea why, in much the same way as a hummingbird has the FEELING it oughta fly south in november, without any real understanding of why. it's the designer's job to listen, to analyse, (bringing their SKILLS into play) to translate what they're hearing from the client into good, communicative design. and if, after the client's prodding, the solution is pathetic, it's a case of the designer not rising to the challenge, and blaming it on the client is just lame.

to the point of novelty, here's an interesting quote from stan the man:
<em>
"Type design moves at the pace of the most conservative reader. The good type-designer therefore realizes that, for a new fount to be successful, it has to be so good that only very few recognize its novelty."</em>
First Principles of Typography

		<div class="commentbody"><em>So, the hotmetal type is superior to the handwritten,</em>

That's not my point.
Novelty is a separate principle, nothing to do with functionality.
Consider digital type: when it was introduced, its quality was a lot poorer than phototype. It wasn't really cheaper either, as the capital costs for graphic designers were huge, especially the Laserwriter. The learning curve for going digital was pretty intimidating. So from the point of view of job quality and economics, there was nothing added for me in 1988 by going digital, just a lot of hurdles. But I couldn't resist the novelty, and could see the writing on the wall.

Morison was a book-centric Brit, and his quote dates to the days of hand-lettered headlines. But even then, there were plenty of novel type designs. He pointedly ignored such as Kennerley and Cooper Black, that came outta left field, took the typogrpahic world by storm, becoming mainstays of American commercial culture.</div>
