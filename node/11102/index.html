It was designed with classical proportions in mind, more or less. The numerical suffix designates 7 pixels above the baseline, and an average width of 5 pixels per character. I'm not entirely sure that this naming system will be as useful as it first seemed, but we'll see.... <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br> <br>I really hope this displays properly. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> Your comments are welcome, and very much wanted.... <br> <br>David</div>

<div class=commentbody> You mean 11 PPEM. <br> <br>I like the lc a lot. But the UC (except for that wonderful "Q") is mostly a mess - sorry. <br> <br>The overall texture is pleasing, and some of the non-alphabetics are cool (like the Pilcrow), so I'd say you're mostly there! A couple of things: the zero is strange; I'd lower the "at" by a pixel. <br> <br>If you can afford it, get BitFonter - it rocks. <br> <br>BTW, what's with the ankh?! Cool. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Is that an ankh? I thought it was the dude from <br>Mar's Attacks. <br> <br>Very nice flavor, as usual David. It has a woody <br>feel--like most of your stuff. In context, (in <br>the sample text you provided) the UC looks fine, <br>appropriate, etc. But the spacing, when you run <br>the UC alphabet together, looks like it needs <br>work. <br> <br>Finally, perhaps consider a double v for the W... </div>

<div class=commentbody> You're both right about the spacing & kerning, of course, especially among the UC glyphs. <br> <br>As for the ankh, it's a part of all of my fonts. (When was the last time you actually USED the infinity symbol, after all? <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> I relegate that one to the alternate set). The ankh fits in so well with the dagger and double dagger that I include it in all my fonts as a potentially useful symbol or ornament. I think every font should have one. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br> <br>And I love Mars Attacks! (Narf! Narf, narf, Narf!) <br> <br>Hrant: <br> <br>What about the UC isn't working? Is it just the spacing, or are there some other design considerations? <br> <br>As always, thanks for the input. <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody> David, I think I was maybe too harsh. <br>But: besides problems with specific caps (like the "B" and "W"), overall I think you're applying the oldstyle divergent-width factor too strongly - like the "E" being really narrow - stuff like that. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> This is nice. Agree with the comments so far, and yes Hrant you were being a bit harsh. ;-) Yes, perhaps the 'E' is too narrow, and while I appreciate the idea behind the 'B' perhaps it as well is a bit tricky. But that 'U' is wonderful. The '0' looks like a football to these old eyes. I *LOVE* the 'g' and the overall flavor. If you are attempting to show rubrication on the '&para;', perhaps the thicker vertical stroke should be in the center. The 'fj' ligature is too wide as perhaps is the 'ft' lig. The idea of the ankh is nice too. What if you lowered the cross stroke so you could elongate the opening and make it look less 'martian' like too? </div>

<div class=commentbody> Thanks for the suggestions, Hrant, Joe & Tiffany. <br> <br>Hrant: You're right about the "@" (at), and you and Tiffany are correct on the "0" (zero) as well. (It seemed a good idea on paper.) I'll try an approximation of a super-ellipse. <br> <br>Wish me luck designing the lower-case figures.... <br> <br>I'll re-examine the widths of the upper case set. I really do want to try to keep the classically narrow glyphs narrow, but one more pica might be in order, especially for UC "E", "F" and maybe "L". I think the UC "B" will work at its current width, but I may have to give up on the smaller upper curve. <br> <br>Joe: As far as that tricky UC "W" goes, I haven't (yet) been able to make the crossings work properly with the pixels, resulting in some extremely clogged glyphs. The result that you saw posted was the least objectionable of the various options that I tried. I'll give it another look, though -- in fact, I would prefer it if I could get the double-V to work. The true solution is out there, Scully.... <br> <br>...which leads us to the alien ankh. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br> <br>Tiffany: your suggestion makes perfect sense, and I will incorporate it, posthaste. I also like your idea on the "&para;" (pilcrow), and I'll adjust the various ligature widths as I fine-tune the spacing and kerning problems. (lc "s" seems especially troublesome in spacing & kerning....) <br> <br>I'm especially glad that the lc "g" and UC "Q" and "U" were appreciated. Those glyphs really hold the spirit of the font that I was trying to create. <br> <br>Thanks again for all of the great suggestions. Any others will be equally appreciated. <br> <br>David </div>
