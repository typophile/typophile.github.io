    was pretty common in that era to design logos as custom lettering. If nobody has
    ID'd this yet, that may be the reason....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thanks Thomas\r\n\r\nThanks for your excellent input.\r\n\r\nFrom my research
    I understand it to be a font from the late 50's / early 60's.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed
    looking through these older fonts and styles:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/as.htm\r\n\r\nFor
    now the hopeful search continues.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nCM"

  body: "Assuming Wikipedia has it right (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Airlines),
    Continental's logo of the period (ca. 1944-67) did not use the same font. It is
    in a fairly similar style, but the letterforms are not the same. Note in particular
    the \"R\" is radically different.\r\n\r\nAlso, if Alaska's logo was used in the
    late 40s to mid 50s, it wouldn't be the same as a typeface from the late 50s or
    early 60s (unless the typeface was based on the logo lettering, as with ITC Avant
    Garde).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
