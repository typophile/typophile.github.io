  <BR> <BR>This is an article about Newspaper Headline Fonts. What bothers me is they
  made their conclusions based on extracting the information from posted PDFs. I think
  that could skew the results any thoughts? Its also only US papers

  body: The study is clearly titled as being US papers only. <BR>&#40;So it&#39;s
    not like the World Series.&#41; <BR> <BR>Any paper, anywhere, can post their front
    page PDF to Newseum.org, which Ascender Corp. used for their study data. <BR>
    <BR>Yes, the study is skewed, but Ascender&#39;s work is self-sponsored, and they
    had to draw the line somewhere. it is not a massive study such as the Poynter
    Institute might undertake &#40;which would still probably focus on the US, but
    would no doubt include papers who don&#39;t post on Newseum, and weeklies&#41;.
    SND would be more inclined to do an international survey. <BR> <BR>It is quite
    ingenious of Ascender Corp. to use Newseum and PDF font-info to come up with this
    information, no matter the skew.

  body: Having seen the initial results, we helped to unskew them a bit but were otherwise
    uninvolved until they published, which happened ironically enough at the Poynter
    Institute. <BR> <BR>This was, in my opinion, and among other things, a brilliant,
    quick and easy way of getting a survey of what newspapers who post on newseum,
    use.  <BR> <BR>We did however notice a number of users who failed to install fonts
    beyond the alphatypes, and also found a few un~~~~~~~~ed users.  <BR> <BR>It also
    points out that there is a lot work in this seemingly tiny slice of market, partly
    because there are a lot of new papers world wide, but also because display type
    churn is a great slow constant...someone, somewhere, is always looking for good
    newsworthy display faces.
