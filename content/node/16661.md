body: Already got the other two parts being a modified Futura and Avante Garde, but
  the other looks very much like Century, but the crossbar on the e isn't right, and
  there's not enough curves on the serifs....I'm baffled!!!

  body: Both the "Futura" and "Avante Garde" are <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.10372.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=24&sampleText=HOMES+quality.+time+and+again&sampleSize=24">Century
    Gothic</a>. (It's a bit ironic that you ID'd them as you did--Century Gothic is
    based on Twentieth Century, a Futura look-alike, redrawn to fit the same character
    widths as Avant Garde for PostScript clones.) The serif face is ITC <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.108297.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=74&sampleText=ncore&sampleSize=96">Bodoni
    Seventy Two</a>.

    I see it, because it seems to be used interchangeably with Futura and Avant Garde...
    sometimes even within the same project.\r\n\r\nMike"

    a lot, except that it was part of the set of fonts developed by Monotype in the
    late eighties as work-alikes for Adobe's core 35 fonts that were built into PostScript
    printers. More info about them on my site:\r\n\r\n\_\_\_http://www.ms-studio.com/articlesarialsia.html\r\n\r\nAlso,
    here is an interesting discussion from the TYPO-L list in 1996 which someone has
    posted:\r\n\r\n\_\_\_http://www.xnet.se/xpo/typetalk/\r\n\r\n"
