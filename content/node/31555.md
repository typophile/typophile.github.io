  body: Would you explain what you mean? This question seems vague to me. There are
    many many things are sort of like this but are in fact discrete aspects of type.
    There are optical illusions, cultural inferences drawn, readability and it's relatives,
    or you might have a very psychlogical/message oriented spin in mind instead. Or
    dozens of other things I imagine. Anyway, please post a more specific question.

  body: Are you referring to how the type is interpreted by the reader? That some
    type should communicate its message without the reader becoming inclined to think
    about the type itself, while other type should be explicitly noticed?

    body: "i once had a dream that ended with credits rolling up in front of the scene.\r\nthey
      were sans-serif, white, and translucent. seriously.\r\n\r\nbut perhaps you're
      refering to the subconscious effect of fonts ?\r\nthis might include all of
      them... at least body, and even much dispay.\r\n\r\nof course we all learn in
      type101 that the reader's experience of fonts can be invisible, \r\nlike good
      cinematography. evocative, moving, inspired, but essentially subliminal if not
      invisible to the un-initiated. \r\n\r\nnot to say it should always be so. i
      think you'll find mention of these ideas in many type histories, and numerous
      essays and interviews in theory publications like emigre...\r\n\r\nwhat are
      you getting at ?"
