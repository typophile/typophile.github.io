  fonts? say Times \r\nNew Roman, etc..\r\n\r\nI know there is some functions such
  as GetTextMetrics, we can use it to get \r\nthe height, the ascent and descent of
  fonts? but how about x-height?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot! "

  body: "Thank you very much for your reply. \r\n\r\nYes, I think it could be done
    by measuring the height of x.\r\nI mean is there any fuctions could do it? like
    GetTextMetrics?\r\n\r\nHow do you do it? What is the common method to get it?
    You do it by measuring it in font bitmaps( first write in some types and save
    it into bitmaps(say 32*32), then check its height) or reading directly from true
    type font file? \r\n\r\nThanks!"

    the bounding box of the lower-case \"o\"; take the height. Subtract the overshoot
    below the baseline.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    the x-height level? Maybe a better approximation would be to take the height of
    the <cite>o</cite> and subtract <em>twice</em> the overshoot below the baseline.\r\n\r\n(BTW,
    why not just measure the height of the <cite>x</cite> itself? Do the serifs sometimes
    get in the way?)"

  body: "Yes, the serifs sometimes get in the way.\r\n\r\nWhen I said the \"height\"
    of the \"o\" I really meant the \"maximum Y coordinate\" - so you only need to
    subtract the overshoot once, becase the lower overshoot isn't getting counted
    in the Y-max in the first place.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "There are various software libraries that allow you to access font files
    directly (rather than calling the Windows API for some information on installed
    fonts). I think using FreeType 2 would be easiest since it provides object-oriented
    access to both OpenType/TrueType and Type 1 fonts: \r\nhttp://www.freetype.org/freetype2/index.html\r\n\r\nFor
    TrueType or OpenType fonts, you can read out the x-height included in the font
    using \r\nhttp://freetype.sourceforge.net/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-truetype_tables.html#TT_OS2
    -- see sxHeight\r\n\r\nI recommend joining the FreeType discussion list to get
    more help. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nA."
