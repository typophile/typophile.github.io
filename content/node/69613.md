body: "Greetings, \r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone could please possibly ID the font
  used in the graphic below. I've come close to a few matches , or somewhat at least
  , but there are always a few quirks that differ from the original piece. I keep
  losing out when it comes to the 'R' and the 'S'. \r\n\r\nAny ideas on what this
  could be? Thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trivia_test_5843.jpg]"

  body: 'Correct me if I''m wrong please , but I found a suitable match , possibly
    even the correct font using the bold type from the Candida family. Not all the
    letters line up exactly , but with a bit of stretching I''m able to make it work. '
