  the lettering to appear scratchy, wobbly, awkward, punk, etc. We would like the
  forms to be considered and resolved yet appear to be made using the hand. So here
  is my question:\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on what the the best paper and ink combination
  would be for the final drawings? We would like crisp edges and lines with no ink
  bleed in the scans. Currently we use Bienfang Graphics No. 360 paper and Micron
  pens. Is there anything better? Thanks."
