  body: It looks like a version of Bodoni Poster Italic with swashes. I&#39;d be surprised
    if it were custom. Mark will know -- he&#39;s the 70s-swash-phenomenon expert
    &#39;round these parts.

  body: I think it&#39;s New Caslon Black Swash that has been slanted. The font has
    every letter except the curly initial T in The Mary Tyler Moor Show wording. I
    found it in the Dover &#34;Swash Letter Alphabets&#34; book by Dan X. Solo

    an old specimen book and redrew the characters as needed. I doubt very much that
    it&#39;s available as a digital font.'

  body: The sample I scanned is from a type specimen book issued by Beissel Inc.,
    a St. Paul, Minnesota typesetting house, probably from the early eighties, but
    there&#39;s no date on it.  <BR> <BR>Also, no information on the source of the
    font. The letter in the codes in the upper right refers to the source&#40;s&#41;
    of the font, but I only know the meaning of a few of them &#40;AI=Alphabet Innovations,
    TS=TypeSpectra, OR=Visual Graphics Corporation...&#41;. No idea what C or R stand
    for.  <BR> <BR>By the way, if anyone does know about these codes, I&#39;m trying
    to track down the meaning of &#34;LI&#34;.

  body: It&#39;s a beauty, isn&#39;t it? One of the nicer examples of this genre I&#39;ve
    seen. It&#39;s interesting that roman versions of this face are common in old
    phototype catalogs, but I&#39;ve only found this one example of the italic.
