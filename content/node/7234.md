body: 'Hello <BR> <BR>This is my first post, however I have been visiting these forums
  for a while. I will just start by saying I am a third year graphic design student
  who enjoys typography despite a lack of proper training. <BR> <BR>Below I have posted
  a typeface I have spent some time on. It started as a rough sketch for a logotype
  &#40;not the one shown in the book&#41; and I decided to make  a set of uppercase
  charactes for it. The theme was futuristic, and the inspiration was the digital
  face you find on LED clocks. I wanted a fairly bold forcefull look to it also. <BR>
  <BR>The book shown is one I made for a years worth of graffiti by local artist Sytak
  hence the name Sytak&#39;03. <BR> <BR>I would appreciate your unvetted criticism.

  body: 'Mhhhh. <BR> <BR>Excuse me, but i think, your font have no surprise. <BR>We
    can tell you why your font is not calling attention. <BR>Maybe if you try to create
    a font based in diagonals and verticals... <BR>but you dont have a system of signs,
    i think your font is only an excercise, and... thats all. <BR> <BR>in my opinion,
    you have to leave this work and: <BR> <BR>1._ file/new <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/51951.jpg"

  body: Gee, I hope someday that I can tell that an idea is not worth bothering with
    just five letters in. It&#39;ll save <BR>me so much time. <BR> <BR>In the meantime,
    I&#39;d suggest that you try to do at least a few more letters, and see what happens  <BR>when
    you combine the in different orders. I&#39;d say that right now, the idea might
    be a bit rough, but I  <BR>don&#39;t think that&#39;s a reason to scrap it and
    begin from scratch. See what you can do with it first. <BR> <BR>But do be prepared
    to scrap any or all of these in the name of going where your font ideas take you.  <BR><IMG

    first using grid paper then replicated in Illustrator. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/51967.jpg"

  body: I would see if you have 2 oe 3 or 6 additional ideas about how to do each
    character &amp; see if even better stuff emerges. I would look for crazier &amp;
    also more conventional shapes - both. Right now I don&#39;t get as clear a direction
    from it as I would like - the feeling of being totally wack &amp; out there -
    which would be cooler or a bit more usable which might also be cooler. <BR> <BR>The
    Wackest letters to me are the X &amp; the R. They don&#39;t appologize at all.
    I like that.

  body: I like how the figures appear three dimensional, but I don&#39;t see that
    in most of the other characters. <BR>4, 5, 6, and 7 especially are in and out,
    which creates some interest for me.

  body: I agree about the 4 &amp; 7 - they have a nice flow. What about letting the
    charcaters come out of the implied box you have them in. The W is wider than the
    L - but what about height? Most of the letters are constrained in that way. The
    8 needs some room i think. The B too. What if you built the letters from something
    physical as part of the exercise - like black tape? I think the M would come out
    differently if you did that. That G needs fixing!
