body: "Does anyone here have access to the Fleuron? Does anyone have Fleuron Number
  4? (I believe that is the right issue.) I am desperate for some information. Gah!!
  I went through all of my notes and cannot find any from my research on Perpetua.
  (This doesn't surprise me as I did lose over 3 boxes worth of my life when I shipped
  it back to me.) From what I recall of the article did have samples of the roman
  and the sloped roman, respectively Perpetua and Felicity. Any assistance for this
  beggar will be very much appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

    few copies of the font examples. But I can only scan it tommorow. I am still going
    to copie the rest, but the one they had in my clossest library was damaged. Somewhere
    iin the comming two weeks I am going to visit another library and copie the rest.\r\n"
