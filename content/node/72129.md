body: "Opentype has a major flaw in it. The limited size of the GPOS subtable is set
  at 64KB. That puts a cap on the amount of Kerning pairs a font can have. Most people
  will probably never go over the amount alloted but for those of us who do it really
  puts a damper on making fonts. I know House Industries had the same problem and
  posted a video on it. I am not sure what Microsoft can do at this point to fix it.
  \ Anybody who is involved with the opentype division at Microsoft, could you please
  pass this note to them.\r\nThanks!"

  body: "This was addressed nine years ago. The \"extension\" lookuptype 9 for GPOS
    (lookuptype 7 for GSUB) was added to the OpenType spec with version 1.3, released
    in April 2001.\r\n\r\nNow, be warned that some older apps and operating systems
    may not support extension lookups, but that is not something that can be addressed
    by the spec.\r\n\r\nThis is arguably just a workaround for a limitation in the
    format overall, but changing OpenType to use four-byte offsets instead of double-byte
    offsets would be a huge and highly incompatible change. Maybe some day there will
    be strong enough reason to do that, but I'm not expecting it will necessarily
    happen in my lifetime.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT "

    to expand kerning classes to squeak in just below the 64k limit.\r\n\r\nIdeally,
    FontLab would have an option to expand kerning classes to fill the remainder of
    the GPOS subtable space. In the background, it would test compile, check the remaining
    GPOS subtable space and calculate how many pairs could be squeezed in.\r\n\r\nA

    or expanding classes to fill out the maximum size of a GPOS table, which is what
    you wrote.

    many pairs, the OT code breaks in some apps. Is that unrelated to the 64k limit?

    afflicts us all at one point or another, and Microsoft <em>did</em> after all
    have the good sense to take your advise, on more than one occasion\u2026\r\n\r\nI
    am puzzled and curious though; did Microsoft, in devising the then-new OpenType
    standard, <em>have</em> to adhere to the historical table restrictions of Apple's
    original TrueType specifications? Was it not possible to just breakaway from these
    legacy restrictions and establish a less confined standard? Or did they just stick
    to the existing limitations out of convenience?"

    i.e. for non-OpenType aware apps it still looks like good old TrueType font, so
    may be it has something to do with this issue.
