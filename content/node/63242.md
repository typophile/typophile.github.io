  But I assume the cyrillic was designed later, when the font was concidered succesfull.
  Does anyone know when the cyrillic was developed and/or launched?\r\nOr maybe a
  date for the introduction of any modern sans serif into cyrillic.\r\nThanks in advance!"

    find the answer:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica\r\n\r\n\"...The
    Cyrillic version was designed in-house in the 1970s at D. Stempel AG, then critiqued
    and redesigned in 1992 under the advice of Jovica Veljovic...\"\r\n\r\nThere is

  body: "There have been three official Helvetica Cyrillic designs (and numerous illegitimate
    versions produced in Russia, I believe). There's the original 1970s Stempel photo
    type version, the PS digital version from 1992 that Jovica Veljovic advised on
    (if I recall correctly, this follows the style of the 1970s version), and the
    new version that I designed for the Helvetica World family in 2001 (advised by
    Maxim Zhukov). The latter follows the conventions of Russian grotesks, so stylistically
    is a better fit with Helvetica than the earlier versions, which were generic sans
    serif letters without idiomatic reference to the particular style of Helvetica.\r\n\r\nI
    don't have the 1970/1992 version for comparison, but here is a sample of the Helvetica
    World Cyrillic:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HWCyrillic_5437.gif]\r\n\r\nThis
    received a type design award in Russia in 2005."

  body: "Regarding those \u2018numerous illegitimate versions produced in Russia\u2019
    John is referring to. The very first attempt at designing a Cyrillic version of
    Helvetica goes back to 1963. And yes, it was totally illegitimate. My friend Yuri
    Kurbatov and I had no idea of the rights of intellectual property in type design.
    At the time we were both students at the Moscow Printing Institute, two years
    away from graduation.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1963_Helvetica_Cyr_4804.png]\r\nThe
    typeface was known to us as Neue Haas-Grotesk halbfett. That was the name it was
    shown under in <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lettera-Lettering-Standardbuch-Gebrauchsschriften-Caract%C3%A8res/dp/B0019QL2NI\">Lettera
    2</a></em> (pp. 54\u201355). The <em>halbfett</em> (\u2018medium\u2019) came out
    first, in 1957, and the <em>mager</em> (\u2018<a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schriftschnitt\">semilight</a>\u2019)
    weight was issued by Haas one year later. We only did the <em>halbfett</em>, and
    it became a great hit with our classmates. I wrote about that project in <em><a
    href=\"http://www.atypi.org/05_About_us/70_publications\">Type</a></em>, the journal
    of ATypI (Vol. 1, No. 1, Spring 1997, pp. 23\u201345). "
