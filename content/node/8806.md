body: I was wondering if anyonce could help me. I&#39;ve created several handwriting
  fonts &#40;and variations on a theme&#41; Are there any tutorials/guides/useful
  slices of wisdom about creating type using re-usable elements &#40;parts of similar
  letters&#41; Just re-writing out the alphabet isn&#39;t the way forward. ;&#41;
  They style and type of fonts is immaterial I just want to see how various people
  piece everything together to create a font. Most of the sites I&#39;ve seen deal
  with specifics of software or seem to step over the type construction stage or use
  an existing typeface as a starting block. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts?

  body: From what little google pops up with on Fregio Mecano this is a step in the
    right direction. Althougth when I mentioned the type and style being immaterial
    I was actully still thinking of Roman type rather than going down the route of
    abstraction.

  body: Leslie Cabarga&#39;s Logo Font &amp; Lettering Bible has several pages of
    advice on building alphabets from reusable parts. It&#39;s a very useful and entertaining
    book. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1581804369/qid=1106672981/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/104-9056008-1842317"
