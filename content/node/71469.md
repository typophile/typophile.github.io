body: "I exported my font in FontLab Studio as OpenType PS format and I tested the
  font with different software to see if it is okay.\r\n\r\nI found that using Adobe
  Acrobat virtual printer to \"print\" the MS Word/WordPad document using my font,
  it will cause a postscript error:\r\n<code>\r\n%%[ ProductName: Distiller ]%%\r\nCNLicense-A
  not found, using Courier.\r\n%%[ Error: typecheck; OffendingCommand: show ]%%\r\nStack:\r\n(%%[
  Flushing: rest of job (to end-of-file) will be ignored ]%%\r\n%%[ Warning: PostScript
  error. No PDF file produced. ] %%\r\n</code>\r\nHowever, when I use the built-in
  PDF export feature in Illustrator and OpenOffice.org Writer in Ubuntu, no error
  is found and the font can be embedded successfully. \r\n\r\nIn FontLab, I have already
  selected \"Everything is allowed (installable mode)\" in Font Info window. I found
  that my other fonts exported also encounter this issue but not the fonts created
  by the others. Is there any other settings can cause this problem? I have no clue
  what can cause this problem."

  body: That error message doesn't look like a font licensing problem; it looks more
    like Distiller can't locate the font file. Where is the .otf file located on your
    computer?

  body: "The typecheck error means that the interpreter was expecting one kind of
    data but got something else. The xshow command has to do with symbol widths and
    positioning. Taken together, they suggest that either your font has an internal
    problem, or you have a bad print driver. Since this only happens with Word and
    Wordpad, I tend to suspect PDFMaker (I assume this is what you mean by virtual
    printer). Unfortunately, even if you find out that PDFMaker is the problem, you'll
    still need to figure out why it doesn't like your font.\r\n\r\nTwo things before
    dealing with PDFMaker: First, how did you put the font file into C:\\Windows\\Fonts?
    While you can drag or copy files into the folder, the best way is to open Fonts
    from the Control Panel and then go to File > Install New Font. \r\n\r\nSecond,
    if your font is very large, with many symbols, try subsetting instead of embedding
    everything.\r\n\r\nThose things out of the way, bypass PDFMaker by printing your
    Word document to a .ps file and then distilling the .ps file (doubleclicking on
    the .ps file should launch Distiller).\r\n"
