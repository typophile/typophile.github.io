  book's theme is the school\u2019s 50th aniversary (1957-2007)!\r\nI was thinking
  about Helvetica for obvious reasons... \r\nBut the book has almost 200 pages...
  Helvetica is a sans-serif!  \r\nAny sugestions? I really appreciate any response!
  \r\n\r\nThanks in advanced!     \r\nJ"

  body: "<cite>I was thinking about Helvetica for obvious reasons...</cite>\r\n\r\nIt
    is obvious if your school was composed only of type addicts. It might be appropriate
    if a very popular magazine or newspaper of the time -- popular in Portugal --
    used Helvetica.\r\n\r\nIf what you are after is an allusion to the times, it is
    hard for someone in the States to know what might be appropriate in Portugal.
    But certainly we can say that font selection should be made on the basis of what
    your general audience will appreciate & understand.\r\n\r\nWhere you as designer
    fit in is to avoid the pitfalls an amateur would be apt to make. For example,
    if it were the States, a Bodoni might be selected (<cite>Life</cite> magazine,
    which many people read). But Bodoni's are tricky, they fared poorly when rendered
    in photocomp, and many fared worse in PostScript. So, if the book is comprised
    mostly of photographs, and will be printed on a coated stock, you can probably
    find a Bodoni that will work. But if it is mainly text & will be printed on an
    uncoated stock, I'd skip the problems of Bodoni & get your allusion to the times
    by using something like Franklin Gothic Condensed for display. Again, this for
    the States; a far as I know, it would be inappropriate for Portugal."

  body: "I think I've personally noticed nearly everything in the united states is
    Garamond. Although it's kind of a default, it is a safe bet for a classic book.
    As for Helvetica, Most of us have read (I think) \"A History of Graphic Design\"
    by Philip B. Meggs, which is done in Helvetica, is around 500 pages, and perfectly
    legible. Aside from the cover, I'd call it a successful design. Just watch the
    leading. More importantly than Garamond, Bodoni, or Helvetica though, you'd want
    it to match any theme or mood in the book.\r\n\r\nAs for InDesign or Quark, I
    know a lot of seasoned vets who prefer Quark for books (largely because of the
    custom kerning abilities), but my comfort zone is InDesign, and i've not had a
    problem laying out a book with it."

  body: Both InDesign and Quark will work very well for book design. I'd say use whichever
    program you are more comfortable with.

  body: "You can use Helvetica for a text font, sure. We set the journal <cite>boundary
    2</cite> which uses Helvetica. Aside from watching the leading, you need to watch
    the character fit & word spacing. Space values are that way, they all relate.
    The usual problem with a sans for text is somebody gets the word spacing too tight.
    The second most common problem is selecting a font where the character spacing
    is too tight.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, unless your school was comprised of a bunch
    of modernists or font addicts who don't mind being reminded for 200 pages that
    it's the 50th anniversary of Helvetica, why select it.\r\n\r\nAs for the best
    layout program, it is the one you already know how to use. Forgive me, but you
    don't sound too familiar with book work. Why add to the chore by using a program
    you're not comfortable with?"
