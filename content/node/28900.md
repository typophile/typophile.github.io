  price list. The size will have to be very small (about 6pt or less).\r\n\r\nI am
  looking for a clean, modern, even slightly futuristic look for this pricelist.\r\n\r\nAny
  recommendations? Readability is important...\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nHug"

    is very readable at small sizes.

    due to its x-height it appears larger than many other alternatives. Too bad it

    8 and 9 of the font used by my bank (Chase) which have round tops, round bottoms
    and something across the middle.\r\nArial, e.g., suffers from this too.   I need
    a font for digits whose ascenders and desenders are not bent over -- even slightly.\r\n\r\nIt
    helps if recommendtations are accompanied by reasons. I see few above.  Just liking
    something isn't as good as liking because...\r\n\r\nWhere can I find the resuls

    of small type. You just have to look and judge for yourself. Or talk to the knowledgeable
    folks at the founderies. Some of the sites have PDFs that you can print out at
    size. But be aware that laser printers in general are not as sharp and clear as

    why does Minuscule Deux looked not right on the provided sample (on the thread)?
    It certainly is legible, especially considering the 2/3pt size usage. But the
    shape still confound me.
