  fonts that mimic the look and feel of early computers? I am especially looking for
  something that is similar (in style at least) to [[http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Image:TranswarpComputerDisplay.jpg|this
  computer display]]. Now, that is quite obviously a pixel-y raster font. [[http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Image:Kobayashi_Maru_data.jpg|This
  example]] seems to be more of a vector-y type.\r\n\r\nAgain, I am not necessarily
  looking for these exact shapes, but rather some fonts that evoke the idea of 1980s
  computer interfaces in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\nAny tips or comments would be appreciated."
