body: "The previous topic \"Hebrew Type Design\" was a wasted opportunity. We have
  there several\r\npeople learned and experienced in Hebrew fonts. As a newcomer to
  this field I could benefit\r\nfrom reading what they have to say. Sadly, these comments
  are buried somewhere in the 300 posts and effectively lost.\r\n\r\nThe 200 or more
  post from GoHebrew should not be here, they should be in a blog!\r\n\r\nAlso the
  subject was changed a few times but when this happened new topics were not created.\r\nPLEASE
  THINK OF OTHERS.\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\n"

    people looking for \"topic discipline\" \u2013 because the topic is very interesting
    in general."

  body: I agree, multiple topics would have been so beneficial. The topic of the post
    itself ranges greatly, and I've found so many useful things.... But it is a huge
    chunk of time to go through the whole thing. I've mainly been skimming it, and
    reading carefully when something catches my eye.

  body: Ah, yes. However the read is both worthwhile and not - the good stuff is muddled
    by the fact that there are many pages of discussion.

  body: There is no way to vote on individual posts that I can find. Only on the first
    post of the thread. Am I missing something?
