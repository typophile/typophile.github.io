body: "I want to make a graphical documents with large monolithic blocks of text made
  with URW Grotesk and URW Antiqua. I would like to have some very small \"headlines\"
  blocks between these bigger blocks. I would like another pair (serif/sans) for a
  short title and one or two lines of text below.\r\nDo you have ideas of fonts for
  such parts? Maybe I can keep the two initial ones and use narrow, condensed, extra
  variants, but maybe use something else may be good?"
