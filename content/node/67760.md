  Roman, and really need to build up a gallery of pictures of it in use.\r\n\r\nI've
  been doing some searching but can't find an awful lot, I was wondering if anybody
  could suggest some campaigns/identities to look at, particularly major ones, but
  the more the better.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n-Ben"

  body: Look for works created before 1990. Since that time the font has been so overused
    by non-designers that most professionals have stopped using it if they can. Before
    1990, and 1985, especially, it was a common font.

    in use with the Space Shuttle.

    wordmark]]? That's actually Fry's Baskerville, and not Times New Roman. If you
    download the EPS or AI files from the Industry Canada link, above, you'll be able
    to see the face up close\u2014it's Baskerville."
