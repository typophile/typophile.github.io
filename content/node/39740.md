  or <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/19411\">here</a>, it may be of interest
  that finally, 2005 TDC award winning <em>Minuscule</em> by Thomas Huot-Marchand
  is available through Thomas\u2019 foundry <a href=\"http://www.256tm.com/en/minuscule.htm\">http://www.256tm.com/</a>.
  I have not yet had the time to look at well-printed samples, but as far as I can
  judge for now: Congratulations to Thomas!"
