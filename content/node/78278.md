  anyone who might have seen it before, specifically the lower case glyphs since the

    don''t quite match. L & K look like broad pen calligraphy while the lower case
    look like brush strokes. The swashes help unite them. '

  body: "Ryuk, it looks similar to billy argel font, but notice the sharp tips inside
    the \"e\" are on the left side typically where youd start the stroke and you'd
    continue that flow to the end of the character. the \"argel\" font has a style
    that is similar but almost backwards in the sense it starts at the same point
    and loops around the hook of the e and then reverses direction and flows to the
    end of the character.\r\n\r\nSE piel script is actually quite different.\r\n\r\nJustin_ch,
    at first i didn't think it(my screenshot) was custom but looking over it again
    the e's are identical, but the a's are not. the first a has a slight tip on the
    left edge of it where the 2nd a doesn't and also seems slightly elongated.\r\n\r\nI
    almost feel like the chars were cut/pasted from other peoples work and combined
    together.\r\nsome chars have very similar components when compared to this image
    http://maxx242.com/images/typography3t.jpg\r\nespecially the h(except for the
    bottom swirl) and the top tips of some of the letters (h, b, etc).\r\n\r\nSo im
    thinking the girl who said she drew this by hand is lying, and just butchered
    some other designers works and put them together with some other swirls to make
    the logo/typeface.\r\n\r\n:/\r\n\r\nps. thanks for the help. \r\n\r\n"
