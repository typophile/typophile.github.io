  the serif font from the opening credits. The 'U' is quite unique. Can anyone identify
  it?\r\n\r\nThere's also a hand drawn United Artists logo that I quite liked before
  the credits rolled. Curious who made it. It matches the feel of the film. Anyone
  know anything about it or of a type face that resembles it at all?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_6741.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/united_6028.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks.\r\n\r\n<cite>Does Michael Cimino think he\u2019s Woody Allen or something?</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    was going to mention that. I just came across that a couple weeks ago on <a href=\"http://kitblog.com/2007/12/woody_allens_typography.html\">kitblog</a>
    by chance and it didn't even hit me that these were the same typeface. Funny,
    but it had a different feel in this context than in one of Allen's flicks."

    Woodman's openers.

  body: Not expecting much info on the UA logo. Figured I'd post it out of curiosity
    while I was at it though. I did some searching and did find out it wasn't made
    for the film. It's apparently the original logo for UA and appeared at least in
    the 1930's in some of their other films. Love the flourish on that U and the middle
    of that N.
