  <BR> <BR>i&#39;m trying to collect some technical information on the making of wood
  type and i&#39;m having trouble understanding what i thought was a pretty simple
  and clear rule of typography. Shouldn&#39;t the curve of &#34;rounded&#34; capital
  letters like &#34;O&#34; or &#34;U&#34; go pass the baseline just a little? I know
  that this is necessary in order for the rounded letter not to appear visually smaller
  than the others...it is a little hard to explain...I&#39;m attaching a file...thanks.'

  body: Yes, overshoot is important to maintaining equal apparent size. <BR> <BR>But
    you could say that the main contemporary appeal of wood type is in fact in its
    &#34;naive&#34; nature, so... <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: i partly agree with you, but i think it is more of a matter of quality then...i
    guess that type in the olden days was produced by competent and incompetent people...just
    like today. I&#39;m not talking about imperfections...

  body: If you have several pieces of the actual wood type in your hands you will
    see that &#40;at least in all the many fonts that I have had experience with&#41;
    that there is no overshoot built into the font. If you are looking at 20 line
    type, you will see that letters like Z and H fill the body, with only about two
    point of beard for the angle created by the pantograph&#39;s cutter.; not nealry
    enough room to make an ideal overshoot of about 5 points for C, O, Q, etc. <BR>
    <BR>I think the woodtype makers considered it an unneccessary frill, or perhaps
    were just not that aware of typographical niceties. <BR> <BR>I think  that as
    Hrant says, its naivety is its charm.  <BR> <BR>If you take a close look at any
    Hamilton Woodtype book, it&#39;s almost a scandal, the rusticness of the letters&#39;
    finish; but that is it charm. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer

  body: It&#39;s worth pointing out here that the larger the type -and notably wood
    type&#39;s existence is tied to size- the less the [relative] overshoot needs
    to be. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'i honestly thought that it was more of a quality issue...because i have seen
    some wood type blocks that are really well constructed, and the overshoot seems
    to have been taken into consideration. <BR> <BR>for example, look at the &#34;H&#34;
    on the hamilton museum website home page <a href="http://www.woodtype.org" target="_blank">http://www.woodtype.org</a>
    , you can tell that there is plenty of space on the bottom to accomodate an &#34;O&#34;
    or an &#34;S&#34; on the same size block... <BR> <BR>any suggetion on a book that
    may talk about this issue in detail? <BR> <BR>thanks <BR> <BR>so my original question
    was: if i want to reconstruct let&#39;s say a Akzidenz Grotesk, should i follow
    the overshoot principle or ignore it?'

  body: FYI, call the Hamilton Wood Museum. They still have wood type craftsmen that
    you can probably get a hold of to ask them this directly.
