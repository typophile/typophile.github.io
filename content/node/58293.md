body: "Next year, I'll be graduating from Vassar College with a degree in Latin American
  Studies. Sadly, I've realized over the past year that my future does not lie in
  a world of NGOs and/or academia per say but in design and typography. Vassar has
  a limited studio art program with no design courses, so I have not been able to
  learn all the necessary skills and software that I would need. I am proficient with
  Illustrator and Photoshop as I was raised around my family business of printing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  big question is, should I go to another four year institution to get a BA in design?
  What other options do I have if I want to pursue a career in art and design? Is
  there a way to balance tuition and quality?"

- body: "I wouldn't start fresh with a new degree program, I'd try to work with your
    advisers to customize a program that works for you.  Maybe you can steer your
    degree towards a Latin American Art/Design degree with self-study or internships?
    Can you minor in art? If they have no typography or graphic design classes, I'd
    say take all the drawing classes you can while at Vassar. Drawing skills will
    serve you very well. \r\n\r\nIf this doesn't work out, you could always get a
    masters or professional certificate in graphic design at a [[http://www.scps.nyu.edu/areas-of-study/design-programs/professional-certificates/digital-and-graphic-design.html|school
    like NYU]] after you graduate. "

    and taught graphic arts and industrial arts in public school before entering the
    design field. I took a couple of continuing ed courses at SVA. I worked hard on
    my book and I lied where I could to get my first job. Granted this was back in
    1979. But a good book opens most doors.\r\n\r\n"

    design, and motion graphics. Use what you learn to build up a portfolio. Don\u2019t
    chase print, because it is rapidly becoming a very limited career field as the
    newspapers and magazines die off."
