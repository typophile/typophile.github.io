  life and culture kinda thing...(entering through the side door etc...) The blog
  will have reviews and news, but also lots of funny stuff too.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  like anything here or are they all a bit boring? You'll see one of them is looking
  quite phallic which I dont think is a good thing.\r\n\r\nThanks v much\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/one_5006.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/two_4510.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/three_4554.jpg\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/four_3828.jpg]"

  body: "I <em>like</em> the phallic one. The elements are blended into one visual
    object, as it should be in a logo, and there's a feeling of movement, of informality,
    and of fun. \r\nThe monochrome gray is boring, but it's easy to experiment with
    different color schemes. Since the letters are all simple shapes with broad strokes,
    you might even try filling some of them with photos or artwork that articulate
    the blogger's theme."

  body: "The Diamond logo is clever (has the second message \"I Do Brighton\"). If
    you go in this direction, ditch the diamond shape and the writing hand, as they're
    kinda superfluous and distract from the second message. You can easily make it
    more whimsical by choosing a different typeface.\r\n"

  body: 'I don''t think that you want such a vertical mark for primarily web use.  Something
    horizontal usually works best for a website identity.  I think the ''I do'' concept
    is solid, if a little vague (''I do" could suggest weddings for example), but
    the name is vague to begin with.  '

  body: 'I like the very first concept you posted, although it would need some work.
    In the more recent "I do" batch, I like #1 the best, although the line spacing
    bothers me a bit (I like to see lines 1 and 2 closer together, but the ascender
    on the "d" creates a problem). Don''t think I''d agree with comment about being
    too vertical; that one looks more squarish to me than vertical. '

  body: I'd see how an all-caps version looks using Sauna (or Rockwell or any other
    face you're considering) this will help you square up the type and avoid the weird
    gaps. If you do stick to lowercase, capitalize the "i"
