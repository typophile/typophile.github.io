  have to be cursive, although that would be cool. Can anyone suggest one?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help!"

  body: "While that could be a typeface, it could also have been drawn. You could
    just create it yourself in Illustrator using art brushes if you don't need a lot
    of characters. I whipped one up in about 10 minutes using some nice shapes I found
    on deviantart.com. I then converted a few of them to art brushes and simply changed
    the stroke size of each stroke where necessary.\r\n\r\nHere it is for you to download
    from my personal server:\r\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/scottdarispublic/live-color-fully-brushes.eps.zip\r\n\r\nEnjoy
    :)"
