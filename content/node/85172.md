  a grungy typewriter font and the other one is a stencil. Could anyone help here?

  body: I have a feeling these are produced on an actual typewriter and using actual
    stencils respectively. Slight imperfections, bleed, differences in the same letter
    at different sizes...

  body: "You could be right for the stencil font because on a lot of photos you can
    see that they used real stencils. As you said, imperfections and \xBBbad kerning\xAB.
    But in the book for their 20th anniversary you can see that the font is set digitally
    (it could also be a custom font, of course). And for the typewriter I think the
    letters are pretty much the same, take a look at the a and the g for example.
    This one is definitely digital. "

  body: "I'm looking at the /a/ and /g/ and I still say likely typewriter. It's not
    hand-lettering, of course the lettershapes are roughly the same, but look at the
    bowl of the two /g/s, the lower portion of which is noticably differently thick.
    For the /a/s, the very first /a/ has been struck lighter than the rest, the second
    and third heavier.\r\n\r\nHave you got a sample of the anniversary book text?"

  body: "I wrote to them yesterday and got an answer. The typewriter font is definitely
    Trixie Plain. This fits because they generally use system fonts for everything.
    \r\n\r\nThey still didn\u2019t say anything about the stencils, though. "
