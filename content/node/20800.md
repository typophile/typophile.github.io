  it's not going to change immediately. But is there an easy way to prevent the thread

    getting unique hits. And the higher it is on the board the greater the likelihood
    it will hold.

    the 2 top results for \"client name\" and the client wouldn't be too happy about
    that.\r\n\r\nIt's why I didn't name it in the first place; but no fault to the
    admins here for putting it in the title after it was properly identified.\r\n\r\nJust
    hope once the client gets a site it will bump it off. "
