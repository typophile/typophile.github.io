  whatever else there is. As you can tell, i am not a typeface master, which is why
  i am here asking you guys what you normally buy. I am getting to the stage where
  i will soon be investing in typefaces to use as a designer, and i just kind of wanted
  to see what format everyone seems to mostly buy.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am on a PC right

    This is an old-old format (20+ years) that nowadays can't deliver what is needed.
    OpenType (TT or CFF) \u2014 and TrueType to some extent \u2014, is where you should
    put your money."

  body: I get OpenType because it is compatible with both Windows and Mac. Postscript
    for Windows is different than Postscript for Mac and can't be converted. TrueType
    is native to Windows, and can also work on Mac, but not as good as OpenType.

  body: "OpenType isn't quite as bad as Stephen Cole's pictures indicate. Unlike the
    Swiss Army knife, you can do real work with it, though like the Swiss Army knife,
    you do encounter situations where it's limitations really get in the way.\r\n\r\nI
    assume you aren't asking the question \"what's the difference\" from a technical
    point of view. From the practical point of view, you would have to make the decision
    based on what you actually do with type -- what is now called the \"workflow.\"\r\n\r\nAt
    a deeper level, at some point you will likely have to change to the OpenType format.
    Type is software now, and what works depends on other software."

  body: Nice point, Charles. The Army Knife metaphor was meant to show that OpenType
    is inherently more convenient because all the extras are in a single font file.
    But the metaphor also works for the cumbersome nature of a tool if the app doesn't
    support it.

    use of \"English.\" In other words, the 255 characters available in a Type 1 font
    are all you need. Now Quark 6.X will do that, and has some features not currently
    available in any OT-savvy layout program.\r\n\r\nOr, suppose you're like me, and
    every two weeks or so, have to set texts that few OpenType fonts (currently) support
    -- characters from Latin Extended A, for example. Or texts using quotation marks.
    Or footnotes, etc. It is a lot easier to re-work a Type 1 font than an OT font.\r\n\r\nIn
    my workshop are all the sizes of Phillips screwdrivers, not the one-size-rounds-the-slots-on-all
    of the Swiss Army knife. Also a 15-40 Clausing-Colechester lathe and an old Bridgeport
    milling machine. But even with the lathe & mill, there are still times when hand
    tools will do the job better. The same is true of type."

    Also tabular oldstyle figures. But then we ran TeX out of a DOS box & could encode
    a Type 1 font any way we wanted. I'll allow that doesn't fit most users.\r\n\r\nOne
    reason to stick with Type 1 fonts might occur to you if you ever had to add some
    kerning to an existing OT font. And the bugs in IDCS2's exception dictionary drive
    us crazy, esp. since they seem to be worse in CS3.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that,
    you pick your poison based on your needs, which I hope was my original point."

  body: Gerald, many foundries do consider future versions. Many do not allow derivatives
    and/or modifications. Many also do not allow reverse engineering. I think these
    items separately or together protect the fonts. This assumes, of course, that
    those who license the font (software) to begin with respect the EULA.

    true. But Adobe does, and some foundries have changed their policies over the
    years. It depends on the license you have when you originally purchased the font.
    For instance, when I wanted to buy Scala from FontFont for a PC, It was only available
    for a Macintosh. \"Just convert it,\" they said. You won't get that answer now.
    \r\n\r\nIn passing, I do have problems with some of my old fonts -- like having

    revenue for a foundry than simply offering new formats as if they were new designs.
    The conversion process is certainly not as labor intensive as the initial design
    release. If no features are added, and in many cases they are not, the upgrade
    price could be minor, if additional features are added, the upgrade price could
    reflect this. I doubt there would be much resistance if handled in such a manner,
