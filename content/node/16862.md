  body: "That's bizarre. Especially since Christmas is all over the place. It's like
    this debate over the 'War' has gotten everyone to think that this is a bigger
    issue than it is.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, the House of Representatives <a href=\"http://blogs.washingtonpost.com/thedebate/2005/12/war_on_christma.html\">passed
    a bill to \"protect\" Christmas</a>. The ensuing debate is pretty funny and pretty
    indicative of how ludicrous it is for the U.S. government to pass bills to protect
    a specific religion.\r\n\r\nWish people a Merry Christmas! Who cares!? Focus on
    something that <em>matters</em>, like any of the laundry list of problems in this
    country, let alone the world. Christmas isn't suffering because of \"secular\"
    activities, it's suffering because its practitioners are missing the point. Heck,
    even <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/12/06/churches.closed.christmas.ap/index.html\">megachurches</a>
    are closing on Christmas because of anticipated low turnout due to Christmas falling
    on Sunday. Who would have guessed that churches themselves would be fighting the
    war against \"the reason behind the season\"? Even Fox had 'Happy Holidays' ornaments
    for sale on its site before this B.S. crusade started.\r\n\r\nAs was pointed out
    by Rep. Gary Ackerman: \"Is this another war we fight for reasons that do not
    exist?\" This is not a war against Christmas, it's the plurality of the United
    States expressing itself through the democracy of the governing institutions.
    Welcome to freedom, people. It's not that you can't celebrate Christmas, it's
    that there are other celebrations going on and people want to acknowledge them.
    Christians are the overwhelming majority in the U.S. Self-centered individuals
    are trying to set up the majority as the minority to curry support and money from
    them. It's a con, and an old one."

    songs because they <em>think</em> it's forbidden by the law. The law simply states
    that Christmas displays must have both a secular and a religous reference (an
    angel and a snow man or a santa, for example). And that programs involving singing
    should include multiple religions (hannukkah for example) and/or have secular
    songs in the mix (jingle bells).\r\n\r\nGiven the lawsuits about the pledge this
    year and over prayer in schools in past years it's no wonder public officials

    our economy be without an annual gift-giving day?\r\n\r\nI heard a lawyer on the
    radio the other day say that it is within the prerogative of local governments
    to set up [insert-favorite-holiday-name-here] decoration in the public space,
    because it is permissible for local governments to encourage an increase in local
    consumer spending\u2014which leads to higher tax revenues. [This, at least in
    theory, is good for everybody. Now how far apart from the true meaning of Christmas
    is that <em>really</em> ;-) ]\r\n\r\nI will also be celebrating \"Christmas\"
    this year (well, <em>Weihnachten</em>, actually\u2026), but my Christmas cards
    say \"happy holidays\" on them, too. I may believe in my beliefs, but I certainly
    don't want to offend anyone with them. That's my beef with the Christian Right,
    I guess\u2026 and probably most other <em>\"listen to us, we are 'right's',\"
    too!</em> How are you ever going to convince someone that you are right when you
    starting right off by offending them? That isn't real conservatism. Real conservatism
    (and real Republican-ism, I thought) is minding your own business, and expecting

    viewed as conservatives is what causes confusion. Being a republican and being
    conservative are two different things.  I know quite a few Republicans the hate

    ( Dubya ) playing to the right doesn't help anyone.\r\n\r\nBecause it's about
    two different things.  People that hold signs out that say 'God hates fags' is
    not conservative, nor Christian, they are likely a republican that doesn't know
    the distinction between the two, who grew up going to church, but doesn't mean
    much to them, or hey, I'm white, I must be Christian. That is real bigotry.\r\n\r\nThere
    are many things about Republicanism that make me sick. Unfortunately there is
    more about liberal democracy that make me more ill.\r\n\r\nI mean, I see American
    culture. I see the seperation of church and state distorted out of it's meaning.
    This thing called founders intent clarifies the first amendment \r\n\r\n\" ...Congress
    shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
    free exercise thereof...\" \r\n\r\nwas intended to prevent the formation of a
    'state church.'\r\n\r\n If it was simply about preventing the formation of a 'state
    church'  and not eliminating Christianity from the public square, why is there
    such a fight now? The people of this country are having there ability to even
    see two different sides taken away. \r\n\r\nIn attending a public university,
    I witness the hostility towards Christianity nearly every day, in one form or
    another. The humanists OWN public education. What a convenient way of eliminating
    competition, than distorting an amendment to your own use? Take a look at the
    founding of public education in America. Educational Founding father John Dewey
    wrote lengthy texts on social engineering. The system in place is deviously brilliant.\r\n"

    lame 'happy holidays' card.\r\n\r\nBut seriously, Dan, who do you think you would
    offend by simply saying Merry Christmas, other than people who actually hate your
    faith in all its aspects and would destroy it if they could? Okay, so I wouldn't
    send a Christmas card with an image of the nativity and a message inside saying
    that the recipient would be prayed for in a Christmas novena of Masses offered
    by priests of the Fraternity of St Peter to someone whom I knew to be Jewish or
    Muslim etc. Because that probably would offend. But I've never known a religious
    person in our societies (Europe and North America) to be offended by the open
    and joyful celebration of major feasts of other religions. Indeed, there seems
    to be a sense of solidarity among religious people of many faiths against the
    secularisation of society and atheist agendas. [As an example that doesn't have
    to do with holidays, when radical feminists descrated the cathedral in Montreal
    a few years ago, scrawling on walls and altars with used tampons, the quickest
    condemnation came from B'nai B'rith; actually, they were pretty much the only
    non-Catholic organisation to speak out, the secular civil rights organisations
    were totally silent.] Ironically, plenty of non-Christians have wished me a merry
    Christmas at this time of year because they know it is a major feast for my religion,
    and if I know someone is Jewish and it is close to e.g. Rosh Hashana, I'll wish
    that person a happy new year <em>because I understand that this is an important
    day for him or her.</em> This, it seems to me, is the way to live in a multifaith
    society: to recognise the importance to people of faith of their holy days and
    traditions, to celebrate ones own in an open and generous way, and to respect
    those of others. The idea that you will offend people of other faiths by expressing
    your own is an atheist and secularist ploy: it has nothing to do with a genuinely
    multifaith society, and everything to do with creating a society without faith."

  body: "> It\u2019s just that in the context of the push to remove all religion from
    public life...\r\n\r\nJoe, when you say 'public life' I think you are being a
    bit broad brush. Publicly funded life perhaps. To me there is a big big difference.
    Nobody has to cover their crucifix ( or what have you ) when they go outside.
    If they did that would be 'public life'.\r\n\r\nStill, you may feel that keeping
    religion out of publicly funded life is too paternalistic. And if so, I acknowledge
    that you may have a point. A very good one. People aught to know what is right
    from what is wrong. It seems obvious moral point in favor of cultural life diversity
    etc. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand this tendency to keep 'church' out of publicly
    funded life we have maintained in the good ol' USA means that we are one more
    step away from Pogroms,  Anti-Catholic, Anti-protestant bombings or the many many
    other kinds of religously fueled violence that has surged around most of the rest
    of world. For example Ireland, Israel, India, Indonesia - ( and that's just some
    of the countries that start with the letter 'I' ) have a seemingly intractable
    problems with religously fueled violence. The reasons are of course quite complicated;
    but they definitely have something to do with the fact ( or appearance if you
    like ) of the national government favoring one religion over another. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    I am selling my fellow man short. It's hard to know. But as far as I can see,
    the lesson of history is that all it takes is the impression that your group is
    getting the shaft to create an urge to violence. Especially if your group already
    has the most money, power, etc and seems to stands to loose the advantage. Keeping
    religion out of publically funded life seems like a mighty small price to pay
    for staying as far as possible from turning into anything at all like one of these
    'I' countries. \r\n\r\nIs that insurance currently bought at too high a price?
    Maybe. But given humanity's history, and the current crop of pundits gracing our
    airwaves with their messages of goodwill and tollerance*, I think I'll pay that
    price and even be happy about doing it.\r\n\r\n*I am of course thinking of Bill
    O'Reilly and his poisonous attempt to use Christmas as yet another opportunity

    belief that man is more than an animal. C. that despite what recent law states,
    the definition of life has not changed.\r\n\r\n If everyone was accepted as a
    Christian, who did anything,who believed opposite, what point would belief in
    something greater be, when you simply ignore it because 'it's not nice' ? Thats
    why it exists because it encompasses a set of beliefs that are accepted as truth.\r\n\r\nI
    think more than less, Christians are very tolerant to the strictest interpretation
    of the word. If I should be compelled, I would be blocking abortion clinics every
    day. As murder is against the word of God, true Christianity does not condone
    killing abortion clinic staff.\r\n\r\nEben.\r\n\r\nNazis flirted with Religious
    systems on a political level to leverage what they wanted. That may have been
    cowardly on the part of the clergy/church, but Nazis they had their opponents
    assassinated.\r\n\r\nJust for my info, what were the other 'faith'filled regimes
    you speak of. \r\n( Please exclude politically hijacked religious systems ala
    pre-Enlightenment Roman Catholicism )\r\nActually it's easy to tell when a regime
    uses it's 'Power of God' and own interpretation to motivate it's citizens and
    army to do it's bidding. Constantine did it. He saw the power that faith in Jesus
    Christ held on the people in his kingdom and used it to leverage his military
    will, his subjects, as with later in the Middle ages, were mostly illiterate,
    relying on very few for information.\r\n\r\nHrant,\r\nI can admit the habitation

    the very least, the US needs to formally admit it was Genocide. The people of

    apologize, from the heart. That simple act would inject the humility necessary
    for a superpower to behave responsibly, instead of merrily pillaging far away
    lands and feeling good about it too. This humility would also give Americans greater
    resolve to address other genocides that have been committed, including by its
    allies*. All this might not be of great practical benefit to the quasi-slave Native
    Americans on the ground today, but it's a start. \r\n\r\n* Like in Turkey right
    now:\r\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4552886.stm _\r\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4531782.stm

    the inherent American affinity for Fairness. But\r\nthe American people are never

    killing someone is not aggressively forcing one's views on him or her?\r\n\r\nSecular
    law in Nazi Germany said that Jews were not human beings. Secular law in Canada
    says that foetuses are not human beings. In both cases, biological science and
    common sense say otherwise.\r\n\r\nRape, congenital disease and deformity*, economic
    difficulties, etc. are all hard and painful things to deal with. But so is abortion,
    and most of the women I know who have had abortions regret it very much. And still
    abortion is marketed -- yes, marketed, by for profit businesses -- as an immediate
    relief and an easy solution to the inconvenience of life. The unwillingness to
    care for a child that you also cite is, of course, statistically is by far the
    biggest reason for abortion: children are inconvenient so we, as a society, kill
    millions of them every year out of pure selfishness. No, pro-arbortionists do
    not wish to legally compel abortions, but the pressure exerted on women -- by
    family, cowardly boyfriends, and by the private abortion industry -- to have abortions
    is quite extraordinary, and the assumption in many hospitals is now that if any
    abnormality is diagnosed in the foetus the normal thing to do is to have an abortion.
    I know this first hand.\r\n\r\n* But what kind of congenital deformities are you
    talking about? Thousands of children diagnosed with Down Syndrome are aborted,
    basically because they look 'abnormal' and require more work than healthy children.
    Of course, being female is also considered a congenitally undesirable condition
    by many people, and the law -- or, in Canada, the lack of a law -- makes this
    perfectly legal grounds to kill a child in the womb. So much for abortion being
    about the rights of women: clearly it is not about the rights of the females being
    killed."

  body: "And note, by the way, that I have not once cited religion in my opposition
    to abortion. I am not opposed to abortion because the Catholic Church teaches
    that abortion is wrong. I am opposed to abortion because reason and science agree
    that human life begins at conception: that a foetus is a human being, and that
    killing human beings -- especially defenceless and innocent human beings -- is
    a moral evil. I didn't used to think this way because, like many people in our
    society, I accepted a prevailing and uncritical view of abortion that does not
    acknowledge that what is being done is the killing of a human being. The only
    part religion plays in all this for me is that the Church, in the consistency
    of her teaching and public witness to the reality of abortion, forced me to look
    again and wouldn't allow me to avoid or ignore that reality.\r\n\r\nEric cites
    the fact that opposition to abortion comes from Biblical sources as the first
    of his criterion for opposing it. This is typically where Catholics and Orthodox
    differ from protestants: protestants are likely to say that something is wrong
    because the Bible says it is wrong. Catholics would more likely reverse this construction
    and say that the Bible says it is wrong because it is wrong, and then cite the
    reasons according to natural law, philosophy, science, etc. that show why it is
    wrong. Is this bigoted? To insist that people engage critically with the medical,
    philosophical, social and moral issues of abortion?\r\n\r\nI see a lot more bigotry
    among active pro-abortionists who ideologically insist on avoiding these issues,
    supressing discussion, and go to great lengths to prevent women who are considering
    abortions from confronting the reality of what is going to be done to the distinct
    human life developing within them (including the psychological reality, which
    for many women is very far from the instant relief promised by the abortionists).
    I know women who have had abortions, most of them regret it, and the phrase I
    hear very often is 'At the time I didn't know what abortion was'. So here is a
    multimillion dollar industry, and lobby group, encouraging women to have abortions
    while 'for their own good' shielding them from even the suggestion that what they
    are doing is killing a human being. There is a line in Michael Winterbottom's
    film <em>Code 46</em> that brilliantly captures the doublespeak of the abortion
    industry: 'There was no baby, there was only a pregnancy.'\r\n\r\nNow my religion
    also teaches that stealing is wrong. And perhaps you would claim it bigotry if
    I were to demand that there be secular laws against larceny <em>on the basis that
    the Bible says it is wrong.</em> But I make no such demand. There should be laws
    against theft because it is demonstrably a moral wrong, socially damaging and
    tending to victimse the weakest and most defenceless people in society. These
    are the same grounds on which I believe there should be laws against abortion.
    It is not a position based on 'one\u2019s interpretation of one\u2019s religion'.
    It is a reasoned argument with political and legal significance, expressed in
    a democratic society with the aim of rational persuasion."

      I raise a glass of hypocras to yours, and offer by way of a festive gift to
      all the recipe I use.\r\n\r\nI first drank hypocras at the conclusion of the
      ATypI gala dinner in Lyon, a renaissance feast based on dishes mentioned in
      the writings of Rabelais. Later on the same trip, I purchased a bottle at the
      palace of the popes in Avignon, and I've been making a couple of batches every
      Christmas for many years. Highly recommended.\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nOriginal Recipe\r\n\r\nPur

      on Inglysch Vol.IV p.199)\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nAdapted Ingredients\r\n\r\n3 litres
      red wine (I usually use a southern French merlot or syrah)\r\n265g white sugar\r\n1
      1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon\r\n1 1/8 tbsp ground ginger (I use fresh grated, rather
      than powder)\r\n1 1/2 tsp ground cloves\r\n1 1/2 tsp grated nutmeg\r\n1 1/2
      tsp marjoram (fresh if possible)\r\n1 1/2 tsp ground cardamom\r\n1 1/2 tsp ground
      black pepper\r\n1 tsp ground spikenard, if available\r\n1/2 tsp grated galengale
      (dried galangal), if available\r\n\r\nAdapted Directions\r\n\r\n1. Warm the
      wine until just beginning to steam. Add the sugar and allow to dissolve.\r\n2.
      Mix all the spices and herbs together. Stir half this mixture into the wine,
      then taste and slowly add more until you achieve a flavour you like (you will
      probably need most or all of the mixture).\r\n3. Simmer the mixture very gently
      for about 10 minutes. Strain through a jelly bag (which may take some hours,
      although we've found that squeezing the bag to speed things up and then restraining
      the result in the same way causes no ill effect).\r\n4. Bottle when cold, then
      cork securely.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nGalangal is used a lot in Thai cooking, so
      can be obtained from shops supplying Thai restaurants, or by begging at the
      restaurants themselves. Spikenard may be ordered online or found at herbalists;
      you want the powder not the oil. Oil of spikenard was used by St Mary Magdelene
      to anoint Christ's feet, which has nothing to do with hypocras, but is nice
      to know when smelling this odd and pungeunt stuff."

    5 years you start to adapt!"
