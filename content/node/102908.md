    not sure where I got this idea, but doesn't it create problems if two different
    glyphs are substituted with the same target glyph? On related note, should I replace
    both /dotlessi and /i.TRK (/i basically) with /I.smcp?"

    three identical target glyphs, named differently.\r\nAs Justin says, there may
    be no practical use for that, but if it helps you keep things straight in your
    head and logically organized, it\u2019s a best practice. Redundancy can also be
    useful if you ever have someone else work on your \uFB01les, or return to the
    \uFB01les after several years and try to \uFB01gure out what on earth you were
    thinking back then!\r\n\r\nt.smcp\r\nt.alt.smcp\r\nT.smcp\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "For lowercase alternates, the only reason I can imagine needing a duplicate
    .smcp glyph is if you have some feature coming after smcp that would need to know
    whether the original glyph was an alternate (i.e. in order to convert it back
    to lowercase?). But I can't think of any practical examples of such a feature,
    so probably not necessary.\r\n\r\nFor uppercase alternates, it might be useful
    to include real smallcap glyphs that could be invoked with the c2sc feature.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>You
    should order your features so that .smcp is executed before .alt.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOtherwise
    include both glyphs in the smcp feature (i.e. <code>sub [t t.alt] by T.smcp;</code>)."

  body: This is crazy. All you need to do is put the smcp feature before your alt
    features, or really any features that transform upper or lowercase glyphs into
    something that has no corresponding form in the small caps (e.g., liga). (Only
    exception would be fi and fl which exist as single type-able glyphs in some encodings.)

  body: "True, but that technique requires omitting \"t.alt\" from @smcp_source, and
    complicates feature order.\r\nIf, for some unrelated reason, one decides to copy
    and paste the glyphs in that class, or change the feature order, then things could
    go wrong. This form of glyph proliferation is suggested as a general best practice,
    containing redundancy but pre-empting complications by removing exceptions."

  body: "If I wanted to reuse the lowercase class for something else but also wanted
    \u201Ct.alt\u201D included, rather than add redundant glyphs in the font, I would
    just do something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>sub [ @lowercase t.alt ] by [ @lowercase_foo
    t.alt.foo ] ;</code>\r\n\r\nOr, just make another class, like this:\r\n\r\n<code>@lowercase_extended
    = [ @lowercase t.alt ] ;</code>\r\n\r\nThere are certainly cases where redundant
    glyphs make sense, but if it\u2019s to solve a problem that could be solved by
    changing feature order or adding a class or class exception, I think it\u2019s
    a bad idea."

    to do this when you use the Class panel, but you can add new classes with code
    like this to the bottom right section of the OpenType panel."
