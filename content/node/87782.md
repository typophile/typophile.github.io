  body: "Neo Grotesques will usually be drawn cleaner, with more coherence between
    characters and will be conceived as families from the begginig thus showing greater
    stylistic integration between weights.\r\n\r\nGroteque typefaces were initially
    intended as display faces for newspaper advertisements thus never made good paragraphs.
    Many Neo Grotesque typefaces have more open shapes and better spacing to improve
    this.\r\n\r\nAlso many Neo Groteque typefaces incorporate geometric or humanistic
    characteristics to soften the beefy appearance of Grotesques.\r\n\r\nBut none
    of these are rules, some Neo Grotesque types are conceived to dramatize the clunky
    appearance of early Grotesques as they were derived from early Slab Serifs."

  body: "Even though they have already given you answers I will add some information
    that might be helpfull to someone visiting this post in the future.\r\n\r\nAccording
    to Karen Cheng's Designing Type book, the basic difference between Grotesques
    and Neo Grotesques typefaces is that Grotesques were basically Serif faces with
    the serifs cut off and Neo Grotesques have a more systematic construction."
