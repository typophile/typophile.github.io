  in making it new in digital because we couldn't find anything available on internet.
  No further information also, even on ITC's website.\r\n\r\nSo we are looking for
  information some of you may have, like maybe old itc specimens or catalogues...
  and i also wanted to know what is the legal latitude about \"remaking\" a font?\r\nThe
  goal is not to make it exactly like it is/was, but to get the general feeling, we
  specially like the 70's decorative vibe.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, all i have is this
  (attached) image, so if that was all we could get, it would finally be, for sure,
  a new design...\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\nY"
