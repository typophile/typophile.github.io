  body: Think Secret is a fun read, but very often they quote  <BR>sources who are
    purely speculating -- or in the case of  <BR>recent hardware, just plain fabricating.
    I won&#39;t comment <BR>on this Font Book article &#39;cuz I haven&#39;t read
    it, just keep  <BR>that in mind.

  body: Many of us got to see the programmer from Apple &#40;I don&#39;t remember
    his name&#41; demo Fontbook at TypeCon. I don&#39;t know if many people realize
    this since it was an unscheduled presentation. <BR> <BR>The info and screen shots
    at Think Secret are consistent with what I saw.

  body: I finally received my developer copy of Panther and plan on taking FontBook
    out for a long stroll through the several thousands fonts at my disposal. I will
    be sure to post information based on some real-world testing and not just speculation
    &#40;Think Secret&#41; or controlled demoing &#40;Apple&#41;, providing I don&#39;t
    step outside the bounds of my NDA. So far though... it looks mighty nice.

    auction. Does anybody remember what?
