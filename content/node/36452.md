  The key message is short, and I'd like to display it in 10-15 languages, including
  the major non-Roman scripts and alphabets.\r\n\r\nWhat's the best way to go about
  this? I'd like the type to look consistent across all the languages. And I'd rather
  not buy fonts if I can avoid it!\r\n\r\nCollections I have available: MacOS X and
  Vista bundles, Adobe CS 2 OpenType bundle, MS Office Mac bundle, Bitstream Type
  Odyssey 2 (TrueType), Storm design collection (TrueType), Linotype Basics I and
  II (TrueType), Tankard Bliss (OpenType), URW and Agfa TrueType fonts as bundled
  with a clip art DVD.\r\n\r\nI'd also appreciate guidance on how to locate the characters
  in unicode. For example, I got a handwritten Polish translation and there are \"a\"
  and \"e\" characters with squiggles on the end which I'm finding difficult to track
  down."

  body: "Making the type look consistent across all scripts will be difficult. The
    most obvious solution if one only considers the harmony of shapes is to use the
    most neutral monoline/sans-serif typefaces--preferably the constructed, geometric
    ones--for each script.\r\n\r\nHowever, be aware that for each script there is
    a different set of scribal/typographic traditions that will trigger sometimes
    unexpected responses in native readers. Even sans serifs for the Roman alphabet,
    which we may associate with the qualities of being neutral and clean, were labelled
    'grotesques' when they were being introduced because they were so different from
    expectations of what letterforms were meant to look like.\r\n\r\nHaving seen numerous
    posters of this genre--one that comes to mind is a library poster with the word
    'read' in various languages--I can easily see how an inconsistency in tone could
    come about. (By the way,  the designer of the poster evidently lacked a Hangul
    typeface to set the Korean word for the project, so s/he used what looked like
    a quick and dirty vectorization of a handwritten sample of the word. It wasn't
    particularly effective in maintaining consistency with the words in other languages
    which got the full type treatment.)\r\n\r\nTo counter this inconsistency in tone:
    either choose playful, fun typefaces (like Comic Sans! Woohoo!) for all the scripts
    or go for the serious, stately typefaces for all of them. A mix is just silly.
    Considering the content of your poster, I'd say go for the serious tone.\r\n\r\nIf
    you choose a serif face for the Roman, maybe going for those with less contrast
    in the strokes will help with harmonization with scripts that don't look right
    with much contrast. Then again, something like the Ge'ez script might not look
    too serious with diminished contrast...\r\n\r\nIf you're including Korean, the
    new Malgun Gothic that comes with Vista is a great Hangul sans serif face that
    prints well (when tracked tighter) though it was primarily designed for the screen.
    If you go the serif route, I'm not sure which Hangul serif faces you have, but
    the ones that come with your collections should be decent enough for the job (though
    they won't be my first choice picks, which are unfortunately only available through
    Korean foundries). Just promise not to use the atrocious Hangul glyphs in Arial
    Unicode.\r\n\r\nIf at all possible, try to get native eyes trained in graphic
    design to look at your work in progress. If the nature of your work permits, use
    the Critique section on Typophile.\r\n\r\nAs for the Polish letters with ogoneks
    \u0105 and \u0119, the hexadecimal unicode values (with decimal values in parentheses)
    are:\r\n\r\n\u0104 \t0104 \t(0260)\r\n\u0105 \t0105 \t(0261)\r\n\u0118 \t0118
    \t(0280)\r\n\u0119 \t0119 \t(0281)"

  body: "You should at least know what you're getting into with Arial Unicode.\r\n\r\nOne
    day I saw a Powerpoint presentation in Korean, and from the get-go I couldn't
    get over how weird, unprofessional, and downright ugly the Hangul letterforms
    were. They were clearly imitating legitimate Korean sans serif designs, but looked
    like they were put together by people who had no idea what the proportions should
    be like.\r\n\r\nIt took me a while to figure out that because the Powerpoint file
    was being run on a machine without other Hangul fonts, Arial Unicode was being
    used.\r\n\r\nLet me say this; Arial Unicode is great for screen uses when you're
    displaying snippets of text in foreign scripts. It makes you able to read those
    bits (as opposed to looking at a bunch of squares) without having the support
    of all the specialist fonts--a useful 'unicode' font, as it was designed to be.
    But blow up the Hangul at least (I can't speak for the other scripts) for anything
    approaching display size, and the result is too distractingly ugly to find any
    uses for it. Let me try a visual analogy:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArialUnicodeKorean_6733.gif]\r\n\r\nAll
    this to say, please do not use Arial Unicode for the Korean at least. Use any
    of the specialist Korean fonts bundled by the major companies, but not Arial Unicode."

  body: "I think my comment was misunderstood to mean that the <em>design</em> of
    Arial Unicode was suited for the screen. I only had in mind the computer environment
    where a 'Unicode font' with broad script support would be useful, and I was talking
    function, not design. Apologies for the confusion.\r\n\r\nThomas, Arial may be
    a poor choice for screen display, but the original Latin design is not what I'm
    talking about. Web pages that use Arial for Latin letters may not look expert,
    but will not look too unprofessional, either. It's even used by Google and other
    major sites.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a web page were to display Hangul in
    Arial Unicode, the result will be legible (which is better than having a series
    of blank squares displayed), but ugly enough to trouble all native Korean eyes,
    not just the design-savvy ones. I'm guessing the difference is that the original
    Arial font was designed by actual native readers of the Latin script.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I said Arial Unicode was great for screen uses in displaying Korean, the alternative
    I had in mind was the Hangul not being displayed at all. It's nice to have for
    the broad coverage of different scripts.\r\n\r\nI've been checking the Arial Unicode
    Hangul glyphs again at screen sizes, and no, it has no design merits beyond the
    basic function of displaying mostly legible Hangul letters. The odd, inexpert
    proportions are if anything magnified and further distorted at 10 points on the
    screen. They show up fatally deformed, oddly bouncy characters. Ugly as I find
    the Arial Unicode Hangul at larger sizes, I can imagine it going over the heads
    of Korean readers who pay little attention to design. Not so with Arial Unicode
    Hangul at size 10 points; everyone will complain about how unreadable the text
    is. Using it when there are other Korean fonts available is just perverse."

    isn't immediately clear from the translation that there are not one but several
    government offices for the English Regions, but that shouldn't be a problem. I'm
    curious: why intranet? Does the poster target users of a specific intranet?"
