  if there are any interesting places or people to try to get in touch with to share
  type experiences or meet.\r\n\r\nEverything type related is very interesting \u2013
  sign painters, movie poster designers, type designers, calligraphers, schools etc.\r\n\r\nI
  am a swedish type designer and type developer. You can find more information/contact
  info on my website www.autodidakt.se or contact me through Typophile if you are
  interested in meeting up in India.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nG\xF6ran\r\n"

  body: "Hi Goran, I was in India this May, but in the north. I went to collect newspapers.
    I loved walking through parks and busy areas of cities. In their own ways, each
    had a panoply of lettering to look at. Most fascinating is how scripts are mixed
    everywhere. I assume that everything \"official\" in the south is written in at
    least three languages: the local language, Hindi, and English\u2026 even though
    many southerners may not be able to read/speak the northern Hindi\u2026 together
    with English, it is an \"official\" language. The southern writing systems are
    quite beautiful. Take lots of photos!"

  body: "Dan, yes it's quite fascinating with all this mixing. I've been to India
    a couple of years ago aswell and really got stunned. This time I wanted to make
    some sort of visit to a studio or something like that, to talk to people behind
    the type, and get inspiration etc. If possible :)\r\n\r\nDid you visit Varanasi
    btw, when you were there? I just loved that city. After we had travelled with
    train around the coast and just before going home visited Varanasi, I felt like
    this city was a complete chaotic mix of whole India. In a lovely crazy way, I
    just loved it \u2013 could move there to be honest :)"

    Ashwini Deshpande at Elephant Design*. I met her (and in fact Dan for the first
    time in person) at a type conference in Beirut. She's very kind and equally competent,
    with a strong connection to type.\r\n\r\n* http://elephantdesign.com/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
