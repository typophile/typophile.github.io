body: "Here is another topic I hope to expand in the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/16\"
  target=\"new\">Typographic Edumacators</a> topic area after additional research
  and illustrations.\r\n\r\nI've been searching through many of the topic threads
  concerning type specimens, both online and in print. Typically, users are looking
  for a way of making visual comparisons between type styles in order to select or
  match typefaces for a particular project. Online representations are generally adequate
  enough for most decisions, but completely inadequate for close scrutiny required
  in order to make highly sophisticated typographic comparisons.\r\n\r\nThere are
  many distinctions that can be made by close inspection of printed specimens (including
  magnified scrutiny using a printer's lupe -- wow, an antique item nowadays).  For
  this thread, I am focusing on only one of several aspects that may be useful for
  educating graphic design students about typography.\r\n\r\n<strong>Type Scaling
  -- Display vs. Text design within the same family.</strong>\r\nYounger designers
  may be familiar with typefaces, but few are aware of the many subtle design adjustments
  made to hot metal typefaces in developing a range of point sizes to span small to
  mid-sized text, 18 pt -- 48 pt ranges, to larger display sizes. Is this significant
  anymore, perhaps no. But scaling issues encountered when using a single digital
  font never even enters the minds of younger designers today.\r\n\r\nI have just
  put together a very quick illustration which in time will be expanded with sharper
  scans, more samples and better source files. For now, I invite you just to examine
  the concept.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.acmedigital.net/JianSabu/gill_specimen.htm\"
  target=\"new\">Eric Gill's <em>The Four Gospels</em> comparitive sample.</a>\r\n\r\nAll
  I've done so far is pulled a sample jpg from <a href=\"http://wally.rit.edu/cary/cc_db/20th_century/7.html\"
  target=\"new\">RIT's Gary Collection</a>. The first four levels of point sizes are
  tagged and the bottom samples show characters from the respective line. The jpg
  sample was then scaled up detailing the cap W and N. Obviously the best way to make
  a visual comparison is to make a high res scan of the actual printed piece then
  scale to match x-heights. But the idea is character widths and subtleties of stroke,
  serifs, etc., have been modified by Gill for each point size in order to be more
  harmonious to the form. Better illustrations to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "BTW -- one of the reasons why I selected Eric Gill's <em>The Four Gospels</em>
    is because there is a wealth of information on his work with <a href=\"http://desktoppub.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ&sdn=desktoppub&zu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.itcfonts.com%2Fulc%2Farticle.asp%3FnCo%3DAFMT%26sec%3Dulc%26amp%3Bissue%3Darticles%26art%3Dericgill\"
    target=\"new\">The Golden Cockerel Press</a>, his initial trials and questions
    about designing typefaces, issues about scaling mathemetically and photographically,
    and the revival of the Golden Cockerel typefaces by the International Typeface
    Corporation. All of this makes for a very interesting story (at least for me)
    in the hopes that students might learn about the deeper mysteries of typography.\r\n\r\nOther
    issues related to examination of printed type specimens include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>High-res
    output vs. screen resolution</li>\r\n<li>Better sense of \"type color\" of text
    blocks</li>\r\n<li>Details for making decisions between one vendor's version vs.
    another</li>\r\n<li>Subtleties of letterform lost in small point size samples</li>\r\n<li>and
    any other ideas you care to contribute</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"
