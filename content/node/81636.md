  downloaded the free font Auctoritas, \r\nand I have two files .ttf (one regular
  and one italic),\r\nI'm working on a mac \r\nand when I'm installing the two fonts
  my BookFont says that one is double,\r\nand on illustrator it works only one version
  (the italic version) but not the regular style.\r\n\r\nI can't understand why,\r\nand
  actually the two fonts are different :(\r\nit drive me crazy! \r\n\r\nThank you
  for the attention\r\nSwanina"

  body: "I confess that there are mysterious things happening with that font; part
    of the problem must be due to the naming scheme but also,  part of the problem
    seems to be coming from the sequence \"ita\" that occurs in the fontname and that
    the mac seems to interpret as meaning \"italic\"; indeed, even if I manage to
    install the two fonts and access them (after replacing the fontname \"Auctoritas\"
    with \"AuctoritasItalic\", saving the font file \"Auctoritas_Italic.ttf\" and
    installing it), the \"option I\" command does not work: here is a grab:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/auctoritas_5760.jpg]\r\nYou
    can see, the regular is selected, and Italic stays checked in the font menu. Changing
    the Fullname \"Auctoritas Regular Italic\" to \"Auctoritas Italic\" does nothing
    to it. If I furthermore replace every occurrence of \"Auctoritas\" with \"Auctorjtas\",
    then the font starts working properly. Weird. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Of course, replacing "Auctoritas" with "Auctorjtas" needs to be done for both
    the regular and the italic, whereas the other adjustments were only performed
    on the italic.
