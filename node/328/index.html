<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>just wondering if most of you gridniks out there create grids to lay out your business cards? if you do maybe you can help me out. <br> <br>i'm using the dimensions 90 x 54mm for the card so that the card is subdividable by 2.25mm units, from these subdivisions i've created my typographic grid. <br> <br>my problem is that the baseline of the bottom line of type is not the same distance to the bottom edge of the card as the top line of type is from the top edge of the card. <br> <br>my question to you is, should i forgo my grid for the sake of aesthetics by moving the bottom line of type to sit the same distance from the bottom edge of the card as the type at the top sits from the top edge of the card, or should i stick with my grid and live with a little extra space at the bottom of the card. <br> <br>any suggestions appreciated. <br> <br>thanks <br>iota.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Business cards are so small, i think that whatever aesthetically looks the best will out. I personally don't use grids for business cards. Most layouts don't have equal space top and bottom anyway. <br> <br>you might want to check the dimensions there though - and be sure it'll fit in the credit card slots in someones wallet etc, if thats what you want.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I totally agree with Matthew. Business cards are so small and every C.I. (corporate identity) is so different that a grid is perhaps not neccesary. <br>Just go with you feelings. <br> <br>Ren</div>

<div class=commentbody>no matter what my project is, I always set up a grid to <br>help achieve harmonious proportions. setting up a <br>business card grid doesn't take a lot of time, so it's <br>always worth a shot. and there's no rule that says <br>head and foot margins should be indentical (in fact, <br>there are many that state the opposite). <br> <br>the most important thing to remember is that a grid is a <br>guideline. for consistancy's sake, try to be strict when <br>there are a lot of items based on the same grid. <br>business cards, however, aren't a widely applicable <br>format, so following the grid exactly isn't going to do a <br>whole lot for you. raise or drop your lowest rule as you <br>see fit -- in the end it's the harmonious whole that <br>matters, not your adherence to a grid.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Depends on the design of the business card. But basically, yeah, I work with grids on whatever project I do. I mostly start out without a grid to get the intuitive proportional feeling right and then start building a grid pattern that suits the design - in more complex Corporate Design cases there also is a special logic in the background, a kind of larger DNA of grids and patterns that connect the variuous media, so in such cases I work within the patternparametern I pre-established. Either way, it just helps organize matters and keeps the work tidy :-D. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Thinking about grids. For something as small as a business card I don't consciously use grids. But I am ruler fanatic, constantly using exact measurements, snap to guide and point. Which in a lot of ways is like using a grid, it is just invisible.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hmmm.... I don't use set grids for business cards, but I tend to lay it out first, then establish guides. Works well for me. As designers, we have 'grids' in our minds anyway ;-) <br> <br>The top margin of my business card is <i>way</i> bigger than the bottom! I lined everything up at the bottom :-P <br> <br>Hey!
