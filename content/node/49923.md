body: "If you're using LinkedIn, the professional networking site, you can add Typophile
  to your professional affiliations by joining the Typophile group. \r\n\r\nTo join,
  hit this link: http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=932947\r\n\r\nOver the years people
  have discussed the value of listing Typophile membership among their professional
  associations.\r\n\r\nAlthough membership is an opt-in thing. And although we ask
  for member contributions, we don't require a fee to join. However, we view a Typophile
  affiliation as a signal of where your personal and professional interests lie and
  we feel a public LinkedIn group is one way for people to get direct value from the
  Typophile community as a networking vehicle.\r\n\r\nSo, while we don't expect a
  lot of discussion on LinkedIn -- we expect that to continue on the boards at Typophile.com
  -- we do hope this will foster better networking among Typophiles. "
