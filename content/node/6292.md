body: Like I said before, I&#39;m working on a sans serif face in a vectorial program.
  Now I have to transport the glyphs to a font program.  <BR> <BR>I saw a formula
  at point central to calculate the ascender and descender values based on a 1000
  em square, but after checking ascenders and descenders of font files I got confused
  about where to start to count the ascender and descender lines. Is the top limit
  of a capital acute &#40;

  body: 'There are no firm rules, but the general practice seems to be to: <BR>- Put
    the top limit somewhat above the ascenders or caps &#40;whichever is higher&#41;
    so that the cap accents float mostly above it. <BR>- Put the bottom limit just
    a hair below the descenders. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
