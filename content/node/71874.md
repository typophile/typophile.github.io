  it. Any ideas?

  body: "If you are just looking for a font that can reproduce this lettering that's
    a different problem than if you are trying to identify this type from 1969. With
    no lower case and a limited sample of upper case, it's perhaps easier to find
    something just to match these letters. My candidate from a quick search would
    be <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/okay-type/alright-sans/\">Alright Sans</a>
    from Okay Type. It seems to have a good 'generic' sans feel and it comes in a
    wide range of weights.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Gothic 720 is what Bitsream calls the <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/monotype-grotesque/?testdrive=seed%3D0.502695674309507%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D72%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DDALSRBTENGL%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga">Monotype
    Grotesque</a> series, and I would say that's what it is (Bold, specifically).
    It was very common in England back then. The difference in appearance is probably
    due to the way it was reproduced (molded in relief and painted), so it seems to
    have lost a bit of weight.
