body: "I've run into a problem with GSUB coverage offset overflow errors in a largish
  font I have been working on. Adding useExtension to various lookups solves the problem
  when generating the font in FLS 5.0.4, but not in 5.1 where the error remains. Moreover,
  attempting to compile directly using AFDKO also fails, so I suspect that there is
  a bug in AFDKO 2.5 which is somehow causing the useExtension directive to be ignored.\r\n\r\nI
  was wondering if anyone has successfully compiled code using this directive either
  in AFDKO 2.5 (or FLS 5.1 which relies on AFDKO 2.5). This would help me determine
  whether this is indeed the root of the problem or whether there is some other less
  obvious problem with my code which FLS 5.0.4 (ADFKO 1.6) accepts but which FLS 5.1
  (AFDKO 2.5) does not.\r\n\r\n(n.b. by 'successfully compiled' I mean compiled where
  the directive is actually necessary to prevent overflows -- not just where it is
  present).\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    I could recover an installable version of 1.6, but I think it would be a lot less
    work to make your features file work with 2.5. I can guarantee that the useExtension
    directive does work under 2.5, and that if the font can be *correctly* built with
    1.6, it can also be built with FDK 2.5. Please send me the error log from the
    makeotf run, and I'll see what I can figure out (rroberts@adobe.com).\r\n\r\n-

  body: "After some additional hair-pulling I've discovered (fingers crossed) the
    source of my problem, though I'm still a bit mystified as to why FLS 5.0.4 and
    FLS 5.1 are behaving differently.\r\n\r\nIn my original font (begun pre FLS 5.1),
    I'd tried to get around the lack of standalone lookups in FDK 1.6 by defining
    all of my lookups in a single, unregistered dummy feature at the beginning of
    my feature list, and then simply using lookup references in all my actual feature
    definitions.\r\n\r\nI've discovered that if I split this dummy feature into two
    (or more) dummy features, suddenly I can solve my offset overflow problems with
    useExtension. Apparently, FLS 5.1 chokes if the combined size of lookups *within
    a single feature block* exceeds a the size of a 16-bit offset.\r\n\r\nI don't
    understand *why* it cares whether the lookups are declared within a single feature
    block or not, but apparently it does.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    features instead of one, did you try to remove the <em>feature **** {</em> and
    <em>} ****;</em> wrapper around your lookup definitions entirely?)

  body: "It turns out that my original assessment was incorrect (Karsten's comment
    clued me into this since I'd already tried that to no avail, and if that didn't
    work, there's no reason to think breaking the feature up should matter).\r\n\r\nIt
    turns out I'd made a rather foolish mistake -- I'd performed this experiment on
    the *wrong* version of the font, and was dealing with a shorter set of code. Here,
    breaking up the container feature made a difference, but the reason for this turns
    out to be less than mysterious.\r\n\r\nI'd started out with a single container
    feature, <code>AGIT</code>, which I'd broken into <code>AGIT</code> and <code>AGI2</code>,
    which contained roughly the same amount of code. I'd forgotten, though, that the
    feature file began with:\r\n\r\n<code>feature aalt {</code>\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_feature
    AGIT;</code>\r\n<code>} aalt;</code>\r\n\r\nSince <code>AGIT</code> was now roughly
    half as long, it's no wonder the GSUB table shrank.\r\n\r\nWhen I return to the
    .vfb I'd intended to work with, I get the same problem -- a single <code>useExtension</code>
    is needed in FLS 5.0.4/FDK 1.6 but no amount of <code>useExtension</code>s will
    prevent overflows in FLS 5.1/FDK 2.5\r\n\r\nHowever, this seems to be restricted
    to this one file. I'd thought it extended to some other files as well, but it
    turns out the problem was solvable in these. It seems that FDK 2.5 produces longer
    GSUB code than FDK 1.6 by around 25%. So, except for my single problematic .vfb,
    <code>useExtension</code> will correct overflows, but it needs to be added to
    more lookups. After finding the problem wouldn't go away in my one file, I gave
    up too easily on the others rather than continuing to add <code>useExtension</code>
    until I was able to compile."
