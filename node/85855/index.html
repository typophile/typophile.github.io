  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everyone. I have been searching and search for fonts like this and it's been pretty difficult. So, I come here for your expertise. I apologize in advance if I am not good at explaining/wording things.

The best font I've found thus far is Galapagos BRK

http://www.allfreefonts.com/font-539-galapogos_brk.html

More specifically, I am using the word "know" in all lowercase:

http://www.allfreefonts.com/custom-thumb.html?d=539&fontfilename=galapogo.ttf&custom=know


The features that appeal to me are:

1. Sans-serif

2. No flags on letters like "n" (or whatever that straight part extending on the top left of the letter is called)

3. All letters follow the "n" form. So, the "w" is like a double upside down "n" and the bottom of the "k" is "n" as well. The "o" is basically 2 "n" against one another, although I am more lenient on the "o" not following suit perfectly (as long as it flows). 

4. This goes along with #2 but basically 99% of all fonts have the "k" and "w" as sharp. Instead of the "k" looking like an "h" they have 2 straight lines making them up. The "w" ends up looking like double "v" rather than a double "u" and it kills it.

5. Something bold please. It'll be used for a logo
 
6. If it were free for commercial use... that'd be great. If not, at least inexpensive to buy with a license that allows me to use the lettering for a logo.

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I might be using the font for a few other words as well (although this is the main word). So, a font with some other letters is helpful.

However, at this point, I guess I could make my own. I'm not too confident with that and wanted to see some other examples of this done. If I did want to create my own... is there any free software available for something like this? I don't need much here, so I can't justify an expensive software purchase.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The only thing I don't really like about it is the face that the letters aren't symmetrical. There is a pointier side. You can see it very clearly on the o, but that stylistically is there on all the letters. I have tried copy and pasting the softer edges onto the letters using paint, and I like it better. However, me doing that on paint is not very professional-looking. 

Additionally, I just wonder if there are other styles I would like if I were exposed to them. Maybe letters that were wider, or with flat edges, or something.

Regardless, I like this font. But it isn't perfect. 

In terms of adjusting it myself... what would be a good program to use?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Usually I like to keep the brand name font as the only instance of that font, and use a complimentary font for secondary text.  It is also a great idea to use customized lettering for a logo.  In terms of the legal stuff, it is ok to modify the letters to create a logo that is just vector shapes (using Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape for example), but in this case not ok to modify the letters to create a slightly different font.  Anyway, here are a few other ideas:
