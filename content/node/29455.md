body: "Howdy!\r\nI am a first year engineering student. I am looking for a recommendation
  on which software to use to write reports in.\r\n\r\nI write quite a few reports,
  at least one a week. They are typical lab style reports, not very long, but including
  several equations, figures, tables, appendices, and a more than trivial page numbering
  system.\r\nI have licenses for Adobe creative suite 2 and Microsoft office (being
  a student makes for nice discounts).\r\nI am on a Macintosh, which means that I
  would rather not use office which is not compiled for the intel processor in my
  macbook pro and is a bit slow.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is, what software should I
  use to do lab reports in? I have been using word, but the equation editor restricts
  me to using times or times new. I would much rather use a font a prefer, like a
  garamond or warnock.\r\n\r\nI have done layout in indesign, but I am not sure that
  it is well suited to this kind of work. I believe latex is just about perfect for
  what I am doing, but I am not sure if the hassle of it is worth the work.\r\n\r\nAnother
  question is about Word. Is there any way to get it to recognise my font families?
  I don't need a list of 30 adobe jenson fonts to know that I have them. And when
  I select bold it doesn't change to the bold font, it does the pseudo bold. Same
  thing for smallcaps. Interestingly enough, TextEdit does all the font things I need,
  including bold and italic font switching and auto-ligatures. Not smart enough to
  do caption -> caption bold, but pretty good.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSam\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think InDesign would work well if you take a bit of time to learn the basics
    (if you haven't already) and setup character and paragraph styles. Make yourself
    a template that you can use for future reports; will be quite efficient once you
    have styles defined for captions, headings, footnotes, etc. Also nice to see an
    engineering student (I don't know what your background is or mean to stereotype
    engineers) taking interest in better typography :)

  body: "I have done a bit of work in indesign (newspaper format mostly). I haven't
    been able to figure out how to get it to do the normal work processing things,
    like just typing into the sheet and having it flow page to page. I am sure there
    is a way to get this to happen, but I haven't found it in the help files or online.
    Any help?\r\n\r\nI love the styles idea, they are just frustrating in word.\r\n\r\nI
    suppose it is strange that I am interested in typography, as I am not an artist
    or have any artistic inclinations. I have a hobby of discovering new hobbies,
    as I like to say, and typography was one of those hobbies. Most engineers don't
    care. Most people anyway don't care. I cry when I see people using comic sans.
    They say \"its fun!\" "

    Ever so subtly Apple has been beefing that puppy up (like adding native .DOC capability,

  body: "LaTeX is really the ideal programme for any papers with equations but I found
    it a bit of a steep learning curve.\r\nBut then InDesign isn't exactly easy if
    you're not used to it. The plug-in timd suggests would be useful if you have to
    include a lot of math.\r\n\r\nAs for your comment about <cite>just typing into
    the sheet and having it flow page to page</cite>\r\nYou may find it quicker and
    easier to do the typing in TextEdit. It has the benefits of auto-spell-check and
    the system wide dictionary and thesaurus (select a word, hover the cursor over
    it and ctrl-cmd-D). It's also a much smaller application \u2013\_quicker to open,
    less distractions. \r\nFor me, Word has all the downsides of InDesign \u2013\_resource
    hungry, complicated UI \u2013\_with none of the power.\r\n\r\nSet up your layout
    (and maybe a style sheet) in InDesign and paste in the raw text from TextEdit.
    \r\n\r\nMost people I know do the typing in a basic text editor and use InDesign
    or Quark for layout and styling."

    Vista) might fit the bill - maybe it's boot camp time. It includes a Math engine
    comparable to TeX and along with the Cambria Math font. Also the new UI addresses
    the complexity complaints mentioned above. \r\n\r\nHowever, my question is, what
    are the other Mac-based engineering students in your class using for reports?\r\n\r\nCheers,

    to do the equations, and indesign to do the styles and layout. Those plugins are
    all above the price range of a student.\r\n\r\nI may give word 2007 a try on parallels
    or bootcamp, but I would still rather stay away from the office defaults. I just
    really want to wow the professors, ligatures, small caps, lining numerals, the
    whole shebang.\r\n\r\nOther mac based engineering students are really non-existent,
    as one can guess based on the old mac stereotype. Everyone else uses word and
    equation editor, and writes in times new roman, 12 pt.\r\n\r\nThe class presentations
    are all done in arial. Big, bold, arial. It makes me so sad when I see them every
    day."

    an equation, otherwise the option to do this is inaccessible. Once you are editing
    an equation, use the drop-down menus in the main toolbar to change the default
    font/size.\r\n\r\nAs has been mentioned, Word 2007 is far more intuitive in its
    treatment of mathematical expressions.\r\n\r\nAnother option you might consider
    is <a href=\"http://www.wolfram.com/products/publicon/index.html\">Publicon</a>
    from Wolfram Research, makers of Mathematica. You can download a free trial to
    see if it meets your needs. It is available on the Mac."

    It supports OpenType (and OT kerning tables), ligatures &c and an interface which
    is much less cluttered than Word's. Apparently it can import equations from MathMagic
    (I've never tried this). It isn't free, but not that expensive either; and you'll
    get an education discount.

    sense, the new Office fonts contain the \"shebang\" unfortunately Office doesn't
    let you get at them :-( Another Windows alternate that may appeal to engineers
    would be to write your reports in raw XAML markup ;-) which does support the advanced
    typographic OpenType features.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Sergei said that he had provided the option in the code, but the final decision
    wasn't his to make. What gives?"
