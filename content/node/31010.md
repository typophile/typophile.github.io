body: "I found some wood type at an antiques store this past weekend. The odd bit
  about it is that it seems to be Helvetica! I guess I'm kinda wondering who would
  be printing using wooden type after the 1950's and why would Helvetica live as wood
  type?\r\n"

  body: Wood type was more appropriate for large sizes because it weighed less and
    is generally less expensive, no?

    too. They were able to make much larger sizes in wood than they could with metal."
