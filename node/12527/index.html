  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hi,

i have a project coming up (freelance) that i'm going to have to design 6 postcards for. they are strictly 'reminder' cards and they will be mailed to existing clients and maybe a small amount of prospective clients.

the company works in creative talent recruitment. they've been around for a while and want to remind everyone.

the emphasis on the 6 postcards is visual. the message is taking more of a backseat for something visually catchy and the entire project is open-ended on which way those visuals can go. lots of room/time for exploration.

i've not dealt with a project like this that was so open-ended and geared toward me doing whatever it is i want to do and just generally playing around for a good touch of the time.

my question to some veteran freelancers/designers is how much should i be charging for this project? my initial thoughts were between 5-700 for each card. they will only be mailed once to each client and this is really free advertising for myself as i will get credit for the design and art once they are mailed to design firms and agencies. i'm also playing and experimenting. it seems more like fun than actual freelance work..

thanks all
