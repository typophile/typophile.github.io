    need some kind of transparent effect, so the colours&#39;d have to be chosen very
    carefully to get the overprinting-effect right. Other than that... killer. Just
    please get rid of the stuff on the back, it&#39;s kinda as if Saville would have
    used regular type somewhere on the Blue Monday Sleeve.  <BR> <BR>003 is simple
    and bold, and makes liking type sound like admitting to doing something nasty...

    to do a tint my year.

    all of those cheesy heat sensitive effects one can now get on textiles it would

  body: 09.001, I like very much though know I would never wear it. But thats my taste.
    <BR> <BR>My favourite by far is 09.003, no tackiness about it. Maybe it appeals
    to me because its just such a simple idea, and though overall it may not be very
    original, I know its one of the few t-shirts id wear. <BR> <BR>09.005 , 09.008,
    09.009 .......WHY??, I see from above alot of people like these shirts, I think
    theyre terrible. <BR> <BR>

    add transparency extender to <BR>textile inks to achieve an overprint effect.
    That <BR>job might need to be set up as a three color run <BR>though: &#40;1&#41;
    first color opaque &#40;2&#41; second color <BR>transparent bits &#40;3&#41; second
    color opaque bits.  <BR>Otherwise the non-overprint areas will have  <BR>insanely

  body: The overprint is do-able. It will be tought to get an exact match. Nathan,
    the red might need a double hit to get that color on a darker shirt &#40;depends
    on the ink&#41;. I think you&#39;re right on the 2 screens on the other color.
    Might be able to do it in one by using half tones and non-transparent ink? <BR>
    <BR>The design is a bit large for my taste. Again, it will wind up in your armpits!
    70% would be more like it.

    talking bout&#41;....remember back in the 80&#39;s that glossy transparent stuff
    that got overprinted on care bare sweaters and stuff...the overprint always went
    way over....if that design used just the red  ink and then the transparent stuff
    as the darker...it might work to change the colour of the red to be slightly darker. '

  body: I just left a job with a screen printing company, so maybe my &#39;experience&#39;
    can help to clear things up.. <BR> <BR>Transparent inks are available, but they
    only work on certain colors. &#40;mid-range colors like grey work best&#41; I
    think .001 would work well w/transparent &#40;if you could find a shirt close
    to that color&#41;. <BR> <BR>We had an ink mixing system that could get exact
    Pantone matches....if you&#39;re &#42;really&#42; worried about the color, that
    would be a good way to go. <BR>

  body: hmm, do you mean &#34;tints&#34; ... <BR> <BR>in this design &#40;.001&#41;,
    you have solid <BR>contiguous shapes and you&#39;d just <BR>print that 3 color,
    imho. <BR> <BR>You&#39;d have red, dark burgundy, and <BR>the third color, which
    is kinda slate grayish. <BR> <BR>You could match the slate gray <BR>or you could
    use clear ink to achieve <BR>a similar effect. <BR> <BR>The clear ink will darken
    the fabric and <BR>could achieve an effect as shown. <BR> <BR>We use a base plate
    of white <BR>so the fabric color isn&#39;t a factor. <BR> <BR>Because the designs
    in this competition are <BR>entirely vector, there&#39;s no need for halftones,
    <BR>which are used for raster art. <BR> <BR>as far as tints... <BR> <BR>Tints
    off a main color tend to cheapen the look of T-shirt <BR>designs, in my opinion,  <BR>because
    of the coarse line screen, typically <BR>less than 85; the dots are quite big.
    <BR> <BR>They work great in print! <BR> <BR>Our local screenprinter, the printer
    who&#39;ll print the <BR>Typophile shirts, is the primary printer for <BR>Split,
    Quiksilver, Volcom, Freshjive and <BR>a bunch of others...so we are in good hands.
    <BR> <BR>The operation is quite massive <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>. The place <BR>has 28 automatic machines of 12 color or
    more, all of  <BR>them laser sighted. I could find out what brand they <BR>are.
    Anyway, the printer is always printing with <BR>new inks and new techniques so
    I will advise <BR>Jared and Joe on options depending on which <BR>design wins.
    <BR> <BR>diff. screenprinters do diff. things. but that&#39;s <BR>the info from
    this end. <BR> <BR>bj

    New Baskervilles&#34;  <BR>on the back with &#34;Typophile,&#34; so that it&#39;s
    basically  <BR>saying that we are the hounds of the New Baskervilles.  <BR> <BR>Because
