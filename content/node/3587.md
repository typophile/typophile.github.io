  body: 'I&#39;m in no way a fan of gridnik type design, but one thing you can do
    is use the &#34;Et&#34; structure of the ampersand instead of the conventional
    one - it&#39;s more grid friendly. <BR> <BR>Like in Rotis: <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/agfa-rotis-sans-serif/agfa-rotis-sans-serif/win-t1/191190/character/0026/CP2/1/"

    prof wanted me to stay with the more traditional ampersand though

    though <BR> <BR>It took me a while to figure this out, but in design school I
    realised that I was the one who was more or less in charge of what I did, so long
    as it wasn&#39;t stupid. I reckon that teachers, tutors, professors whatever love
    seeing something else, they sometimes like to see things that aren&#39;t completely
    within the regime of the brief. Tutors can never be clients, and even clients
    can be persuaded otherwise.  <BR> <BR>Nice logotype, given the constrraints. Have
    you considered making the main strokes 2 squares thick and the thins 1 square
    thick? or even 3:2? I say this because the serifs on the n,m,r,s and c are too
    chunky, out of proportion. I wouldn&#39;t trash the Et idea, I have seen some
    pretty &#34;traditional&#34; ampersands that are created in such a manner. <BR>

    &#39;traditional&#39;. <BR> <BR>Maybe what you are saying is the exact opposite,
    you professor may want you to go with a more &#39;modern&#39;, or stylized ampersand.
    <BR> <BR>In case you did not know Et is latin for &#39;and&#39;, this is how the
    ampersand came about, was a latin &#39;and&#39; ligature. <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.'

  body: hmmm,  I see what you mean.  I&#39;m going to try those suggestions tonight.  <BR>I
    think I was just more hesitant to use something that was closer to latin in something
    really modern. <BR> <BR>Kris, thanks for the sugestions,  I originially saw this
    as more of a unistroke, but adding thicks and thins might really make this sing....   <BR>I&#39;ll
    add some updates tonight.
