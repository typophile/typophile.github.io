  body: What I know for sure at the moment is they use(d?) [[http://www.typophile.com/node/107352|Scotland

    a bolder and less 'calligraphy' but overall design looks pretty close.

    Akira! I was a bit confused by the apparent boldness which looks different from
    the previous issues resulting a loss of the 'calligraphy' effect.\r\nAdding more
