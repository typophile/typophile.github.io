  give great thanks to Crossgrove, hrant and anyone else I may have missed for all
  the help. You've been great.\r\n\r\nSo now, I'd really like to find a sans to pair
  with Adobe Garamond.\r\n\r\nor...\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows of a serif similar to Adobe
  Garamond that might pair well with Futura or Akzidenz Grotesk...by all means, please
  let me know.\r\n\r\nI feel as though I'm making a Christmas Wish-List. Ok, for all
  who may lend a hand, godspeed...\r\nsee you later,\r\nJaz\r\n\r\nThe samples below
  are Futura and Adobe Garamond.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01f7badabd4122af48f05d481649b0d1_4649.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adobe-garamond_5243.gif]"

    20th-century flavor:\r\n\r\nThe Benton gothics:\r\nNews Gothic\r\nFranklin Gothic\r\nTrade
    Gothic\r\nBenton Sans (Font Bureau)\r\n\r\nThe unassuming grotesques:\r\nFF Bau

  body: "Futura is surprisingly nice paired with Galliard, which has some of the same
    genes as Garamond. Something about the simplicity and hardness of Galliard and
    the proportions of Futura keep them in harmony. \r\n\r\nBut if you really want
    Adobe Garamond, which is much softer, you could look at Cronos, or one of OurType's
    sans designs might be right: Eva (new), Fresco Sans or Versa Sans. "

  body: "I like my Baroque paired with a humanist. And two of them that has worked
    the best for me, believe it or not, are Scala and Quadraat Sans.\r\n\r\nFor a
    less common alternative, try Fontfarm's <A HREF=http://fontfarm.de/themes/fonts/kofired/index.php>Kofired</A>
    or John Sans.\r\n\r\nFor an alternative to Futura, try an architectural sans (how
    do we come up with such term anyway?) like Verlag or Neutraface."

  body: "I would not combine a Rennaissance-Antiqua with a Futura.\r\nE.g. the italic
    version of Garamond is a very pretty one. Combining it with the Bauhaus style
    of Futura does not make sense for me.\r\n\r\nIf Futura with an antiqua, I'ld look
    for e.g. Memphis, Beton or a Monotype Rockwell.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"

  body: "Hey there, thank you all for your comments! Terrific and very helpful,\r\nI
    really appreciate it. Ok, well, here's what I've chosen to do ( I may be breaking
    rules here, well I most definitely am at the looks of the posts here) I have chosen
    to use ITC Garamond and Futura. \r\nSomeone suggested to me yesterday (Avant Garde
    to go with ITC G.) \r\n\r\nSince they are both geometric sans, Avant G. and Futura
    that is, (excuse my limited typographic vocab is somewhat limited) I thought Futura
    could work as well. They seem to fit together quite nicely for my purposes (and
    time constraints).\r\n\r\nWell, I hope I do not disappoint anyone. I've got to
    do my own thing I guess, but this info you've given me is also priceless, and
    thank you for the support; again priceless, thank you very much,\r\nJaz"
