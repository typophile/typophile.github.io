body: "These fonts are a lot like the Fette Fraktur font, but the capital letters
  are completely different, and the lowercase have small differences. The 2 different
  images are obviously different variations, so I am hoping to find both, or something
  close. I am guessing that the I in Inferno is a different font from the rest, also.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'm willing to bet that "The Inferno" IS Fette Fraktur, just customized with
    the I and the f. From MTV's show, right?

  body: The first one is indeed Fette Fraktur and the cap I has been redrawn. It seems
    too crude to have come from another font (although, you never know). The tail
    of the lowercase f has also been modified.
