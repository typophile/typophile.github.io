body: "Hi typophiles,\r\n\r\nAs a professional Mac tech person and amateur design
  enthusiast, I've been using <em>Folio SB Light Condensed</em> and <em>Bold Condensed</em>
  (samples at <a href=\"http://fere.be/folio\" target=\"_blank\">FontShop</a>) for
  several years in all my communications. The Bold Condensed is dear to my heart,
  not the least because I use it in my logotype as you can see on my <a href=\"http://www.ferebee.net/\"
  target=\"_blank\">website</a>, but as I find myself writing increasingly long text
  documents for my clients, I've grown a bit tired of the Light Condensed.\r\n\r\nI
  want to replace it with something that is at once easier to read while also carrying
  greater authority.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I've decided on H&FJ's beautiful Chronicle
  Deck Condensed. Condensed because I want to economize on space particularly for
  invoices, which  some of my fellow IT suppliers like to balloon over seemingly endless
  reams of paper.\r\n\r\nSo where does this leave my beloved Folio SB Bold Condensed?\r\n\r\nI
  have persuaded myself that it could combine fruitfully with Chronicle Deck Condensed
  Roman, as seen below, but I'm afraid that maybe I'm just getting carried away. What
  do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nChris Ferebee\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample-chronicle-folio_5297.gif]"

    work rather nicely, at least if you use them for \"titles\" and text respectively
    (i.e. not mixing on the same line). \r\nThe relative sizes need some finetuning
    though. FWIW what I would do is take that above sample, copy x times, incrementally
    and very! slightly increase the point size of the Folio in these copies, print
    and compare."

  body: "Yes, that's something I've been struggling with. Interestingly, in the first
    sample above the Folio is actually set at 10.5pt vs. 10pt for the Chronicle.\r\n\r\nAlthough
    the Folio has taller ascenders and x-height than the Chronicle by design even
    when set at an identical numeric point size, it just feels smaller to me. I haven't
    been able to balance the sizes yet; I feel pulled in different directions at once.\r\n\r\nFor
    comparison, here's a sample where both fonts are set at the same numeric point
    size.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample-chronicle-folio-samesize_3490.gif]"

  body: "One thing is that Folio has much narrower proportions, *and* it's a lot bolder;
    both these things make its counters / interior spaces much smaller. And the amount
    of interior white makes a big difference as to how we perceive \"size\" of type.
    You can see this by comparing a very light and a very bold weight of the same
    typeface at the same point size; the bold will most often appear to be smaller.\r\n(But
    of course, the solution is not to make the interior white spaces numerically the
    same.)\r\n\r\nYour \"MMiixxeedd\" example shows exactly why I said it'll be fine
    at least as long as you don't mix them on one line. ;-)  Do you agree that on
    the left side, the \"Item description\" looks smaller than the \"Detailed explanation\"?
    And on the right you see that's not \"true\"; but typography is much less about
    what actually *is*, than about how the eye perceives it. This is a prime example
    of that. :-)\r\n\r\nSo don't be afraid of going even a bit larger than 10.5. Maybe
    it's going to be 10.75, maybe 11, maybe even a bit more. It needs to look balanced.
    FWIW, I just combined a Roman serif text font (Whitman) with a bold sans (Fedra),
    and the \"apparent\" same sizes worked out as 9.5 : 7.6!"

  body: "Hi Nina,\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your thoughtful comments. After putting
    down the printout many times to let my eye capture another fresh impression, it
    seems to me that the sweet spot is Folio at 10.95pt or 11pt vs. Chronicle at 10pt.
    Example below with 11pt, as 10.95pt looks identical at this screen resolution.
    With the size issue cleared up, I'm liking the combination better and better.\r\n\r\nI
    still need to figure out what to do with the figures on the invoice template.
    Previously I had the last line of figures (end total) in bold, but now I think
    it would be visually too confusing to mix figures in Folio SB Bold Condensed with
    figures in Chronicle Deck Condensed Roman on the one hand, or introduce a bolder
    weight of Chronicle on the other, while the headings are set in Folio. Perhaps
    one style of figures (Chronicle Roman) is excitement enough. :-)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nChris\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample-10-11_3649.gif]"

    people?!), but as far as I can tell from the image you posted, to me this seems
    to look quite good indeed! I'm beginning to really like this pairing. The best
    thing would be if you could show a PDF \u2013 you'll have to attach it to the
    first post in the thread. That could also get you some feedback on the question
    of the number styles\u2026 \r\nBTW, this thread might have been a better fit in
    the Critique/Typography section, but I don't think that's tragic (and if some
    Moderator thinks it is, they can just move it I guess). \r\n\r\n* Which might
    have been interesting, because font pairings aren't typically something all designers
    always agree on. ;-)\r\nEDIT: As to why, I just realized it's Saturday \u2013
    Typophile tends to be slower over the weekend."

  body: "Nina,\r\n\r\nI guess you're the only professional who isn't kicking back
    for the weekend while we amateurs muck about in the forum. ;-)\r\n\r\nAs for the
    PDF, I like the idea, although I would need to rework my layouts first. Right
    now all I have are the old designs, based on Folio Light and Bold. However, as
    I understand the license from H&FJ, they specifically forbid making PDFs publicly
    available that embed their fonts. Only one-to-one communication of so-called \"workflow
    PDFs\" is allowed. (I'm interpreting this to mean I can send a client a PDF invoice
    created with Chronicle...)\r\n\r\nIn case Jonathan reads this, I will say that
    I would have had an easier time deciding to buy the fonts if I had been able to
    find a greater variety of online samples, particularly PDFs. I'm very happy now,
    but was a little worried that I might be mistaken in the choice I made based on
    the intentionally limited Test Drive tool at H&FJ."

    Benton Sans compressed or condensed instead of Folio Cn Bold. Or something louder

    Tungsten, which is similar but nicer IMO. But in the end I don't really see how
    they go better with Chronicle than Folio Bold Condensed. Can you expand on your
    distaste for the Chronicle/Folio combination?\r\n\r\nHowever, thanks for suggesting
    Benton Sans! I had missed that, and it's a pretty smooth match for Chronicle,
    to the point where I might be able to consider mixing Chronicle Deck Condensed
    and Benton Sans Compressed Black on a single line - a definite versatility plus
    - do you think that would work?\r\n\r\nIs the match too smooth? I'll have to think
    about that some more. And then return to the relative size issue, though the discrepancy
    seems to be less than with Folio. Here's a sample of Chronicle vs. Benton at identical

    could take over from Folio SB Bold Condensed in that context without losing its
    step.\r\n\r\nBenton Sans Compressed Black carries the load with ease, watch. Logo
    on the left is based on Folio, logotype on the upper right is the current version
    using Folio SB Bold Condensed, and below that is a new rendering using Benton
    Sans Compressed Black.\r\n\r\nI'm amazed how well it works. Previous attempts

    not available in condensed, but my tests of Chronicle Deck Condensed at 10pt on

    squarish, \"1960s\" Folio Cn Bold might be well if i imagine it set in a much
    larger size, newspaper style like, but here in comparable optical sizes it looks
    a bit off to me, a bit undecided.\r\n\r\nBTW H&FJ mention in their \"goes well

    perhaps Whitney Cn/Chronicle Cn?)."

    the structures aren't too parallel. Yes, Benton is a more \"harmonious\" partner,
    but isn't it also more boring? (The safest choices aren't generally the best ones.)
    And less technical/clean. I would much prefer the old logo, too. Way too many
    awkward angles and curves in the new one (look at the white [i.e. orange] space)."

    the Benton Sans goes very smoothly indeed with the Chronicle. The other online
    demos aren't as chintzy as H&FJ's, so I was able to try it out pretty thoroughly.
    Time to buy a face? Maybe so. I really only need the Compressed Black, it's just
