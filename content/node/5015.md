body: I have read many of your threads about Chinese/Japanese typography and i found
  really useful hits and answers for my questions. But there is one thing i really
  would like to know. Are there any good books about &#34;learning typography&#34;
  for the asian area &#40;especiall japanese one&#41; in english. Because there are
  really good ones for the latin alphabet and i would like to learn more about this
  subject and delve into it. Any recommendations ? Thanks a lot in advance.
