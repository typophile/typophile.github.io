  establishment:\r\nhttp://typotrip.wordpress.com/2007/09/16/type-archeology/\r\nThis
  is a tricky one since the letters themselves are not there anymore - just the marks
  they left on the wall.\r\n\r\nStephen from Typographica.org suggested it is something
  related to Volta Bold. That's the closest so far but I have overlaid Volta Bold
  over the photograph and it seems the thick stem should be even bolder and the whole
  thing more extended.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? "

  body: Quite likely it's not a "font". Until recently, signs on buildings like this
    one were usually made by hand by sign painters or sign makers, and each sign is
    unique (and in some cases each letter). This one looks like it may have had dimensional
    letters attached to the building.

  body: "When stretched horizontally most of the letters of Clarendon Extended seem
    to fit quite precisely! (I'll still double check tonight on a high-res photo at
    home.)\r\n\r\nI have a hunch that this sign was not that old after all and that
    it was created according to a design that was simply stretched out to fit the
    needs of the space. Still not such a rare practice in these parts of the world.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "So far Clarendon Extended looks like the closest match although not without
    the stretching.\r\nBelow is an image where I've placed Clarendon Extended stretched
    20% horizontally on top of the photo. Now the stretched 'D' shows that the letters
    on the wall might have been designed proportionally. Also the 'K' looks differently
    structured.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uduka_bad_clarendon_4290.jpg]"
