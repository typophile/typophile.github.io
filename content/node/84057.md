  spots to visit? I tought that there would be some Nocholas Jenson or Aldus Manutius
  museum but I just can't find anything.\r\n\r\nAt least I can shoot a picture of
  the houses where the shops were located if somebody knows the location.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    The actual place of the Aldine officina is not known, nothing remained. \r\nMaybe
    you make some discovery.\r\n\r\nBesides that: scroll through the city, get off
    the beaten tracks.\r\nFine-tune your eyes for the glyphic language of the architecture.
    Go inside the churches and view engraved lettering on epitaphs and tombs \u2026\r\n\r\nHave
    a good time."

  body: "It's a strange advice for a person who's going to pass his honeymoon in Venice,
    but...\r\n\r\nI live in Mestre and I recommend you to visit the Biblioteca Nazionale
    Marciana (Marciana Library), the most important library in Venice and one of the
    most important in Italy (not only the museum: go into the library). There you
    can find a lot of incunabula and books of the sixteenth century (see OPAC at [[http://polovea.sebina.it/SebinaOpac/Opac]]).
    In Marciana there's the complete aldine collection (for example, there are two
    copies of DE AETNA by Pietro Bembo [IMPRESSUM VENETIIS IN AEDIBUS ALDI ROMANI
    MENSE FEBRVARIO ANNO .M.VD.]; the most beautiful copy is \"ALDINE 380\": it's
    a magic to hold it in your hands [but less then to hold your future wife in your
    arms]). Warning: to read requested book(s) you have to wait half an hour, at least;
    so, if you are going to take a visit, you must have clear ideas of what you want
    to see before entering. You can find information about the rules of the library
    at [[http://marciana.venezia.sbn.it/]] (in italian).\r\n\r\nAnd if you have time,
    you can visit \"Tipoteca Italiana Fondazione\": a typeface and printing museum
    in Cornuda (not so far from Venice; nevertheless there's some difficult to reach
    it by train). It's very very interesting (information at [[http://www.tipoteca.it/]])
    and it's near to Asolo (remember Bembo) and not so far from the Dolomites (better
    than a museum for the honeymoon; and in november is not so cold yet).\r\n\r\nGood
    luck.\r\n"

    we see Comic Sans used inappropriately... is hardly surprising.

    yourself in the vicinity of San Giorgio dei Greci, the Greek Orthodox cathedral,
    keep your eye open for a lovely sign that was outside when I was last there: an
    imaginative use of brass Latin letters to represent Greek. I recall an upside
    down U representing \u03A0 as the biggest stretch."

    the Biblioteca Marciana sniffing the copy of De Aetna recommended by dfp, I'm
    sure I could have found a better use for those 150 euros but the experience was
    worth it and she forgave me soon.
