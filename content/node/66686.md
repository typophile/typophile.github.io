  at the city knows what it is.  The \"My Fonts\" automated I.D. system suggests \"Identification
  - Five C\".  This seems close but the \"4\" does not seem to match.  I also think
  that the bottom of the \"2\", the part where the loop downward joins onto the horizontal
  base may be slightly different as well.  \r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-identification/five-c/\r\n\r\nI'm
  sorry I haven't got a better sample for viewing here.  \r\n\r\nHopefully someone
  has an idea.  Thanks for whatever help you can provide.\r\n\r\nRob[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mystery
