    you're looking for, but I don't recognize the Gros Cicero as a size. \r\n\r\nUpdike's
    list of sizes includes Gros Canon, Gros Parangon, Gros Romain, and Gros Texte,
    but no Gros Cicero. Could this be an error? Or is this designation unique to the
    particular oeuvre of Granjon?\r\n\r\n-- K."

    the facsimiles that I have. There was a reference in a note to a Gros Cicero by
    Granjon that Morison lists in his inventory of the Le B\xE9 foundry, but it's
    not shown in the Le&nbsp;B\xE9&#150;Moretus fragments that I have.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    apparently the \"gros\" in this case seems to indicate a Cicero with a large x-height.
    Similar, I suppose, to the \"gros oeil\" designation that Fournier used a generation
    or so later.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\n\u2018Gros Cicero\u2019 is a name that has
    been given to one of Granjon\u2019s types for which there are some matrices at
    the Plantin\u2013Moretus Museum, but they were not acquired until quite some time
    after Plantin\u2019s death, so it does not appear in books about him. One reason
    why it has become well known is that Pierpont, the Technical Director of the English
    Monotype Corporation, found it in a type specimen that was printed in 1905 from
    old types in the cases at the Plantin\u2013Moretus Museum, and based Monotype
    Series 110, called Plantin, on it. In fact most of the letter a\u2019s in this
    font are wrong-fount characters, and the italic is a later type that has nothing
    to do with Granjon. Nevertheless, Pierpont and his head of the type drawing office,
    Steltzer, between them made one of Monotype\u2019s most accomplished typefaces
    on this worn and muddled fount, which was also used to set the introduction to
    the specimen.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Granjon Cicero MPM 1905
    a 450_4264.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo although this image from the 1905 specimen is not a
    brilliant one it may be the most useful one to offer it here, since it shows not
    only the wrong-fount a, which got into Monotype Plantin (and therefore into Times),
    and which by mischance is used here in Granjon\u2019s name, but also the right
    one, which is seen with a grave accent in the first line and in \u2018grande\u2019
    in the second.\r\n\r\nThe most up to date and reliable account of the type can
    now be read in the well-illustrated collected edition of Hendrik Vervliet\u2019s
    essays on the types of the major French 16th-century punchcutters, which has just
    appeared under the title <em>The palaeotypography of the French Renaissance</em>
    (Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008). An important book, and much recommended. But
    beware: it is very expensive.\r\n\r\nJust to fill in the bare historical details,
    the type was used for nearly two hundred years in France, the Netherlands and
    Germany, where it has first been seen in use in in 1569. Its design is historically
    remarkable as one of the earliest types that have an unusually large ex-height
    and look larger than they are. (In fact, the fount at Antwerp has the name <em>S.
    Augustin</em>, which is a size larger than <em>Cicero</em>.) Matrices for the
    type were quite widely distributed, and it appears in the specimens of several
    different type foundries. Maybe the most useful reference, since there is a facsimile
    edition and the example is well printed from sharp, new type (with the correct
    letter a), is the specimen book of Lamesle, Paris, 1742, where it appears under
    the name of <em>Cicero gros \u0153il</em> (\u2018Cicero with a big face\u2019).\r\n"

  body: "Kent, you are correct in your supposition about \"gros\". According to Charles
    Bigelow in his review of Galliard in <em>Fine Print on Type</em>, \"[the] Gros
    Cicero (c. 1568) had an x-height comparable to a Garamond St. Augustin (14\xB0)
    on a Cicero (12\xB0) body. In Rome (c. 1583) he cut a larger, similarly proportioned
    face on the St. Augustine body, which is named Giubilate in the Vatican type specimen
    of 1628.\""

  body: "The consensus appears to be that not only the wrong-fount a in the cases
    at Antwerp but also the italic that Monotype adapted for their Plantin (which
    can be seen on that first page of the 1905 specimen) may be the work of Johann
    Michael Schmidt (died 1750), also known as J. M. Smit or Smid, a punchcutter who
    learned his trade in the Luther foundry in Frankfurt am Main, worked in the Netherlands
    and spent a few years in the 1730s with the newly-revived foundry of the Moretus
    (formerly Plantin) printing house in Antwerp, before going off to Sweden and finishing
    up in Berlin.\r\n\r\nHere is a close-up of the Gros Cicero as it appears in the
    specimen of Claude Lamesle, Paris, 1742. This is not a common book, but there
    are copies to be found in a number of libraries, and although the collotype facsimile
    published in 1965 is worth a look, there is nothing that quite compares with the
    sight of impressions from new type cast in the 16th-century matrices. The same
    specimen has spreads showing Garamond\u2019s big Canon roman, and Granjon\u2019s
    italic for the same body, and other romans and italics by both artists.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Granjon

    bigger roman from the same book, on Petit Parangon (about 20 points) here but
    sometimes cast on a smaller body. In some ways it\u2019s a more subtle working-out
    of a design similar to that of the Cicero but with a more normal x-height. That
    g is about as pretty as they get. The U is later.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Granjon
