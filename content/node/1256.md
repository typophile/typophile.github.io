  (31 k)</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-/Attachment-!> <BR> <BR>The working title is
  Butler Antiqua. The roman is a transitional ostensibly in the tradition of Ruzicka
  and Dwiggins. The italic, which I&#39;m happier with, is based on one of my own
  ideas from a few years back, for better or worse one of my best ideas. There are
  several problematic glyphs in the roman, particularly the s. Some of the alternates
  are silly. The half-r might not make it in the final cut. I want to iron out the
  problems in the lowercase before I embark on the caps. <BR> <BR>The italic round
  letters &#40;c e o &amp; s&#41; might be too superelliptical and end up being trashed.
  S&#39;s, as you can see, are a pain for me. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to hear some comments.
  This started out as an exercise in drawing in FontLab. I&#39;m now comfortable drawing
  in it, so I achieved that goal. I want to move on now and eventually build it into
  something commercially viable. The italics are IMHO unique, but outside of the quirky
  alternates &#40;which serious printers would likely find more irritating than useful&#41;
  the Roman just seems to lack any compelling originality. But I&#39;m a pessimist
  and hoping to hear a second opinion. :-&#41;'

  body: ' If indeed the italic is your own idea and it is the roman that is only &#39;ostensibly
    of Dwiggins and Ruzicka&#39;, then you must have Dwiggins&#39; spirit floating
    around feeding you ideas. :&#124; The italic looks much better at smaller sizes,
    although it would be interesting to be able to use at display sizes. perhaps you
    create two versions? I have to agree that some of the characters are odd, but
    again these odd characteristics hide themselves at text sizes. But that makes
    sense because Dwiggins&#39; designed for text. So I assume you are following along
    with the same idea of using the roman capitals with the lowercase italic? Or are
    you still working on the uppercase? I&#39;d be very interested to see these when
    completed. &#40;I did read what you just wrote, so I guess we will wait.&#41;
    If it is a transitional, you still have too much of the rigid scotch showing,
    I&#39;d try to apply a little more pen to it. <BR> <BR>the lc &#39;g&#39; looks
    to be falling backward, and the upper-story is perhaps too small for how large
    the x-height appears in the other characters. the alternate lc &#39;r&#39; calls
    too much attention to itself. the lc &#39;u&#39; is too open. the lc &#39;a&#39;
    is a bit too wide. i prefer the open lc &#39;k&#39;. there is something fun and
    clever about the second &#40;from the left&#41; of the three lc &#39;x&#39;.  <BR>
    <BR>How about a paragraph setting? And perhaps you need to refer back to your
    McGrew under the Arcadia and Charter. '

  body: ' Tiffany: Thanks for the encouragement. To answer some of your questions:
    Yes, it&#39;s only a text design. I might make a display version some day, but
    I expect this one to be used at around 13pt or less. <BR> <BR>Understand I&#39;m
    not explicitly shooting for a Dwiggins look. That was just a starting-off point.
    I sat down in front of the screen and drew these from the top of my head with
    no reference material. I wanted &#40;among other things&#41; to see what my conception
    of a transitional font would end up looking like. It grew out of some exercises
    I was forcing myself to do at the time, like staring at an arbitrary font specimen,
    say Palatino, and then sitting down and trying to draw it from memory. Inevitably
    you will introduce new elements or variations that are products of your own mind.
    In the end, I don&#39;t know how useful these kinds of exercises are, but I guess
    I&#39;ll find out once I finish this! :-&#41; I&#39;ve accepted the possibility
    that this might not end with anything anyone would want to buy, but since I have
    no formal instruction in type design, exercises like this are all I can think
    of to get proficient at it. &#40;Apart from calligraphy exercises, which unfortunately
    are not an option until the nerve damage from my recent hand injury heals further.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>John: I&#39;m glad you like the half-r. It was actually once a somewhat
    common character, used contextually like a long s, but more common in blackletter
    than Roman. There were, however, a few Roman types that included it, even if it
    was seldom used. I&#39;d encourage anyone to include a half-r in any fonts where
    they include the long s and its associated ligatures. The font will be OpenType-only,
    and the half-r only gets substituted when there&#39;s an r next to a round-right-side
    letter &#40;b,o,p&#41; when Contextual Alternates is turned on.  <BR> <BR>And
    yes, Tiffany is right, the thing is not in common use and calls attention to itself,
    so I&#39;ve put it into the Contextual Alternates feature. I&#39;d put it in HIST
    as well, but InDesign doesn&#39;t currently support HIST. &#40;Grrr.&#41; Lots
    of the unconventional ligatures and alternates you see in the showing will definitely
    not be the defaults, if they even make it through at all. <BR> <BR>The italic
    will have at least two sets of capitals: an upright set and a slanted set. There
    will probably also be swashes further down the road, but I want a good base design
    that can stand on its own before I froof it up with swashes. But when the froofing
    does begin, it will arrive with a vengeance. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post some more
    specimens when I iron out the most pressing problems in the lowercase. Those s&#39;s
    are fired. My one big worry is that the Roman and the italic won&#39;t look good
    together. I&#39;ve taken care to keep the minimum and maximum stroke weights consistent,
    as well as x-height, ascenders, descenders, cap height, and serifs, but I worry
    that the italic is too superelliptical compared to the Roman, and I really don&#39;t
    want to embark on a superelliptical Roman just now. So the round italic letters
    will likely get rounder. '

    allows for a lighter letter. I hope that makes sense. '

  body: ' OK, I&#39;ve definitely never seen that italic that you post. Up until now,
    all I&#39;ve known from Dwiggins is Electra, Caledonia and Metro, plus that famous
    title page he did in his letter to Ruzicka. The italic I drew was totally mine.
    This is a weird coincidence. It was the roman that I thought would be closer to
    Dwiggins. The lowercase roman n and derived letters reminded me of Electra, so
    that&#39;s where I thought the Dwiggins influence came in. <BR> <BR>But now I&#39;m
    worried. I said that this &#42;started off&#42; as an exercise in learning, but
    I&#39;m really hoping to release it in the end, because only when I start selling
    type will I be able to finally call myself a type designer. And I do want to release
    something that&#39;s historically informed, as opposed to Yet Another Abstract
    Design For Techno Album Covers. Dwiggins and Ruzicka were also not the only designers
    whose faces I stared at. There was also Baskerville, Walbaum, Fournier, Bodoni,
    Didot... all the definitive classics, and even Bernhard Modern and Lucian. Then,
    like I said, I sat down and drew the roman, and paired it with the italic that
    I already had sitting around in my brain. So the idea that this design would be
    too derivative did not cross my mind, and I&#39;m still nowhere near convinced
    that that will be a problem. Every designer today that releases text faces with
    any degree of classic feel will agree that there are some historical nods in there,
    but that doesn&#39;t make it excessively derivative. So think of it as something
    I intend to sell eventually. <BR> <BR>So being dangerously derivative is not what
    I&#39;m worried about. I&#39;m worried about it looking like crap, which in its
    present state, it does. '

  body: John, I think your last statement is an accurate assessment. Some of the similarities
    between your italic and Dwiggins&#39;s Charter experiment are uncanny, but I don&#39;t
    think that your design is dangerously derivative. However, you will want to keep
    working on both the italic and the roman to get them up to a serious, saleable
    quality, as you recognize. <BR> <BR>When I first looked at your sample, I found
    the italic eerily familiar, but it wasn&#39;t Charter that I thought of. I immediately
    thought of a few letters in Bernhard&#39;s Tango. I could also swear that I&#39;ve
    seen something similar in some of Ruzicka&#39;s experiments, but I couldn&#39;t
    find what I was thinking of in my collection. The roman, for some reason, reminds
    me a little of Bob Aufuldish&#39;s New Clear Era. I point these out not as accusations
    of derivation but in the hopes of finding examples that might help you find your
    own voice. <BR> <BR>BTW, Tiffany, I&#39;m pretty sure the second Charter example
    you show &#40;the one from the smoke proofs&#41; is a &#34;pre-release&#34; version.
    When I look closely at the final cut &#40;as shown in the &#91;original&#93; Typophiles&#39;
    <I>Postscripts</I>&#41; the low branching is not quite that open. I think Dwiggins
    must have modified his approach for the &#34;final&#34; cut. I&#39;ve always admired
    this experiment and think it&#39;s a shame that he didn&#39;t finish out the capitals.

    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think you should round out the italic. It is the squarish

    o etc. are extreme, but the h,n,m are also pretty square. I wouldn&#39;t sacrifice
    the blocky energy for the sake of the roman. As for the roman, I would take some
    cues from the italic. While the g is a little wobbly, it seems to correlate most
    closely, because it&#39;s wholely organic. I think loosening up some of the rigid,
    compass like circles would tie the roman to the italic without having to &#39;eliptify&#39;
    it. While the roman isn&#39;t as dazzling as the italic, it certainly has promise

    the loopy k and w and the small-cappish q would add more uniqueness to the lowercase,

    TARGET="_top">version 1.5</A> can now be downloaded via a click-through agreement.
    <BR> <BR>I personally use <A HREF="http://www.fontlab.com" TARGET="_top">FontLab
    4.0.5</A>, which currently requires Windows. I&#39;m curious to hear if Mac support
    will be part of the new version 4.5 announcement at the upcoming TypeCon. Both
    FontLab and DTL&#39;s new app, <A HREF="http://www.fontmaster.nl" TARGET="_top">FontMaster</A>,
    use the Adobe FDK to compile OpenType fonts. The fact that FL4 lets you test the
    feature code visually without having to export the font saves tremendous time,
    and makes the price tag easily worth it. But you have to be willing to learn and
    use the FDK&#39;s feature description language, which looks vaguely like Perl.
    And for now, you have to settle for working on a Windows machine. <BR> <BR>&#40;PLUG&#41;
    If you want to build OpenType fonts but find the learning curve or Windows requirement
    prohibitive, you can certainly hire me to do it for you. :-&#41; If interested,
