body: "I want to make to operate stacking diacritics, for example ocircumflex with
  breve above. First way to type it is: ocircumflex + breve, the second: o + circumflex
  + breve. I made it that way:\r\n1. ocircumflex is decomposed to o + circumflex\r\n2.
  o and circumflex are positioned via mark\r\n3. circumflex and breve are positioned
  via mkmk\r\nSo whatever combination you type (o \u0302 \u0306) or (\xF4 \u0306)
  you get proper stacked letter. It works beautifully in FontForge but to my astonishment
  only in FF. What is going on? Please help with this enigma.\r\n"

  body: "With no font to check (or at least feature code snippet, if you are writing
    feature files), it is hard to tell what is going on. \r\n\r\nStaping in the dark,
    my first guess would be broken application(s), try testing in Notepad in Windows
    and/or Firefox, if still broken then make sure you have set script and language
    correctly for your feature."

  body: "Janek,\r\nI've recently added the exact behavior you're describing to a font
    family on which I have been working. However, I compiled my fonts using the AFDKO.
    The resulting fonts have the correct behavior in MS Word (I tested version 10
    on XP) and in InDesign CS6 with the World Ready composer applied (there seems
    to be a bug in this regard in the default composer). Those were the only instances
    that I tested. I've sent the font off to someone who does Jarai typography in
    XeLaTeX, I'll post back with his results, if interested.\r\n\r\nHere's my decomposition
    code in FDK syntax. Note the lookup titled DECOMPOSITION is outside of any feature
    block and before the <ccmp> feature. Also beware of the wrapping commented line
    below:\r\n\r\n\r\n<code>lookup DECOMPOSITION {\r\n\t\tsub Ecircumflex by E circumflexcmb;\r\n\t\tsub
    ecircumflex by e circumflexcmb;\r\n\t\tsub Ocircumflex by O circumflexcmb;\r\n\t\tsub
    ocircumflex by o circumflexcmb;\r\n} DECOMPOSITION;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>feature
    ccmp { # Glyph Composition / Decomposition</code>\r\n\r\n<code>\tlookup GLYPH_DECOMPOSITION_CONTEXTUAL_2
    {\r\n\t\t#decomposes ecircumflex and ocircumflex forms when followed by combining
    breve: Jarai language support\r\n\t\tsub Ecircumflex' lookup DECOMPOSITION brevecmb;\r\n\t\tsub
    ecircumflex' lookup DECOMPOSITION brevecmb;\r\n\t\tsub Ocircumflex' lookup DECOMPOSITION
    brevecmb;\r\n\t\tsub ocircumflex' lookup DECOMPOSITION brevecmb;\r\n\t} GLYPH_DECOMPOSITION_CONTEXTUAL_2;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>}
