  has to be legible down to a small point size.\r\n\r\nThe font used for text in Pokemon
  trading cards seems to be ideal (for example, the text in the Pokemon Magnemite
  card).\r\n\r\nWould anyone know the name of this font or possibly recommend an alternative
  font?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nAdrian."

    it's one of <a href=\"http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en/thumb/c/ca/263px-Shedinjacard.jpg\">these</a>
    it should be Gill Sans."

  body: Adrian, if you want us to do the effort and try to identify your font, I think
    the least <em>you</em> can do is do the effort and post a sample for us to look
    at.
