body: I am interested in the roots of Akzidenz Grotesk, a truly seminal typeface for
  the development of sanserif, considered anonymous by various sources. <BR> <BR>According
  to typolexicon.de, the &#34;Royal Grotesk&#34;, by German typographer Ferdinand
  Theinhardt is its direct precursor. Do you know any publication or website where
  I could find a specimen of this typeface?  <BR>  <BR>In broader terms, talking about
  the context in which it appeared, Robert Bringhurst in &#34;The Elements of Typographic
  Style&#34; relates it to the Realist movement in art. Do you know of any other source
  in which this is further discussed?  <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot <BR>

  body: '&#62;the Caslon sans of the 1820s, so praised for its early appearance, has
    no real relevance. <BR> <BR>Huh? The guy invents a major genre and it&#39;s irrelevant?!
    The sans is present in the specimen books of UK typefounders &#40;I&#39;m not
    familiar with other countries, but I would imagine the same situation&#41; from
    the 1830s, and in steady use, especially advertising, subsequently. <BR> <BR>Caslon&#39;s
    sans had a very geometric quality -- circular Os and straight-legged R etc. Figgins
    sans&#39;s of the 1830s show an indecision between geometric and grotesque qualities,
    with versions at different sizes leaning one way or the other. <BR> <BR>Those
    earliest sans were Bold and Caps only, and appear to have been used mainly for
    contrast, in text work. The most popular early sans was probably the Bold Condensed
    style, used in a range of sizes, particularly in commercial jobbing. Regular weight
    sans faces were used in the 1840s. <BR> <BR>I suspect that the introduction of
    lower case to the sans genre pushed it in a grotesque direction, as the world
    was not ready for a geometric lower case at that time &#40;the 3rd quarter of
    the 19thC&#41;, when the radical tone of the early century had become more conservative.
    <BR> <BR>AG is well-known for the logic of its systematic family, and it is tempting
    to equate this modernist idea with the sans genre -- however, almost no-one used
    sans faces for text in 1900. In fact it was the massively popular Cheltenham that
    lead the way in being a face with a large family that you could set an entire
    job in: heads, decks, subheads, and text.'

  body: In my opinion, we could talk about two different approaches to the grotesque,
    one developed mainly in the UK and USA, and the other in Germany, that follow
    different lines. <BR> <BR>As I see it, the first develops in the UK from the Caslon
    breakthrough, and represents the modulated, less geometrical approach, that has
    in Franklin Gothic its paradigm. The tipology of this line remains fixed through
    time. Thus Trade Gothic &#40;1948&#41; and News Gothic &#40;1908&#41; belong to
    the same formal category.  <BR> <BR>The German grotesques of the XIX century,
    like Akzidenz Grotesk, tend to geometry and monoline anatomy, and a more systematic
    development of the range of weights. I think this ascetic approach fitted more
    the rationalist modern spirit of the XX century typographic avant-gardes. Thus,
    this grotesque tipology evolved  in time into neogrotesque &#40;Helvetica, 1957&#41;,
    by absorbing the influences of the technical and aesthetical  proposals of those
    avant-gardes. <BR> <BR>Of course, this comparison has nothing to do with a value
    judgement, in terms of one being &#34;better&#34; than the other in any way.

  body: Xurxo <BR> <BR>One slight problem with the Caslon &#34;breakthrough.&#34;
    The type was shown on a specimen only as an information marker and not a face
    that was offered for sale. It is thought by some historians to be a dead link.
    There are other earlier examples but they were seemingly only found in stone cutting.
    <BR> <BR>More likely there was some form of interplay of influence between styles
    offered from different countries.  <BR> <BR>For instance. The Americans who developed
    decorative wood type based it on British metal type imports which were in turn
    derived from French decorated typefaces and then Dutch, at about the turn of the
    century and very early 1900s. The popularity of American wood type in turn resulted
    in metal type foundries churning out a lot of similar decorated styles. <BR> <BR>Sometimes
    the string of influence is just not a straight line. <BR> <BR>Gerald

  body: "<em>Gerstner program was released by Berthold for Diatype, I guess in 1957
    after Univers, Before Helvetica... </em>\r\nIt certainly wasn't. Diatype was still
    being developed then. The first usable machines came onto the market in 1961.
    Gerstner Programm was designed in 1967.\r\n\r\n<em>Where these stamps came from?
    Berthold? Linotype?</em>\r\nThese are obviously rubber stamps, set into a composing
    stick-type-of-device after the individual letters had been stamped onto the ink
    pad. The whole stick with the rubber letters inside it was then turned around
    and pressed onto paper or any other material. The sample says \"Lettering for
    windows, displays, exhibitions, shops\". \r\n\r\nThere was another material, called
    Plakadur, Plakat being the German word for poster. It was a wood/plastic composite
    that Berthold made its larger \"wood\" type from. They had a beautiful, fairly
    light cut of Akzidenz Grotesk Medium which was used for showcard printing machines.
    They were produced by a small company and sold to department stores for printing
    large labels, showcards, price cards. Essentially, you placed the type into the
    bed of the machine, inked it, put the paper on top of the type and ran a pressure
    roller over it, like a small proofing press. Apart from AG Medium, the had other
    Berthold faces, e.g. Herold, Block Condensed and Fanfare (by Louis Oppenheim,
    the Lo-Schrift \u2013 now LoType \u2013 designer)."

    I wrote earlier, they were rubber stamps or made from a composite material, sold
    under various trade names. One company in Germany was called Neoprint by Gr\xF6ner
    GmbH. They made sets in Plakadur and rubber, but i haven't seen them used since
    the 1980s. They're not made anymore, but \u2013 like everything else \u2013 probably
