body: I&#39;ve spent the last week on holiday and in that time I&#39;ve filled two
  sketch books full of new font idea&#39;s. The Golden Bus Company typeface is the
  first I&#39;ve transfered from sketches to screen &#40;still need to transfer the
  lowercase sketches&#41;. <BR> <BR>I was reading a book called &#39;The Wrong Way
  Home&#39;  by Peter Moore which covers his travels from London to Sydney overland
  &#40;along the old hippy trail&#41;, and one part of the journey involves travelling
  across Pakistan on colourful buses, the pictures this put in my head were the starting
  point for the font. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15132.gif"

    <BR>- The second &#39;C&#39; looks nice, but is just a tad too closed. <BR>- Why
    not add some curve to the &#39;K&#39;, &#39;Q&#39;, and &#39;R&#39; strokes? <BR>-
    I like the &#39;X&#39; much.'

    R &amp; K seems an improvement to  me, I edited the C a bit and the diamond in
    the O  was off centre. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15147.gif"

  body: 'I&#39;m partial to the second or fourth A. <BR> <BR>I like the beginnings
    of the lowercase, particularly a and k.  r and c stick out, though; r has a huge
    gap underneath it &#40;maybe you can tweak your fishtail terminals to alleviate
    that - retracting the upper portion and extending the lower&#41; and the serifs
    in c break the counter into two.  Also, in f and t the repetition of terminals
    creates this confusing sawtooth effect &#40;I suspect that you could preserve
    your feel while alleviating this by using single-lobed terminals with the same
    characteristic &#39;fin&#39; shape&#41;.  e also catches my eye for its thin strokes
    - how would a more open variant, with a diagonal crossbar perhaps, work out?  It
    seems to be a very linear character for a distinctly circular face. <BR> <BR>Quibble:
    The P is inconsistent with B and R.  Deliberate?'

    the lowercase, I have to agree with Shreyas&#39; comments... <BR> <BR>Looking

    Bilak and Max Kisman in Amsterdam, and not being shy, I got out print outs of
    two of my faces and invited comment. <BR> <BR>Peter kindly put in nicely... &#34;It&#39;s
    interesting that you have made the width of the letters the same all the way round,
    because most people adjust the weight to make the letters flow better&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>So taking this advice and some of Max&#39;s scribbles on board, I&#39;ve started
    to alter the weight of the letters... <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s moving in the
    right direction, what do you think? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24394.gif"

    you could open up some counters by dropping the ends of the letters below the
    baseline. <BR> <BR>The new, modulated forms are great.

    <BR>ok, just as i think I am done with this font &#40;it has been released as
    part of the Building Letters 2 pack&#41; I start to wonder about the weight distribution
    in the uppercase. <BR> <BR>The top version is the released version, the bottom
    one is where I have made changes to th weight distribution, what do you think?
