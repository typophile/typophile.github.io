  body: "Hi all\r\nRight in the center of the website is a brown paper To Do list
    with the numbers 1-14 on it. Each one is crossed out with a red line.  As stated
    earlier, it does look like it is some sort of typewriter font, but I'm wondering
    if someone could tell me specifically which font was used. Thanks to all!"

    out in our links. Only you could tell what you find unique in that. So you're
    the best person suited to identify it.\r\nOther possibilities:\r\nhttp://trixiefont.com/\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/distressed_typewriter/\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/typewriter/"

  body: Hi thank you for your help. It appears to me that the notes have been done
    on a typewriter, but I don't see any distressing in the fonts. The only noticeable
    trait that I see, is that the words do not appear to type on a straight line.
    In particular, the "a" in each word always seems to be raised or elevate above
    the other letters on each line.
