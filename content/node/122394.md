  body: "The |a| appears to be from TS Curly (free for personal use only). It\u2019s
    been stretched a bit in your sample:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/ts-curly.font?text=ahw&psize=l\r\n\r\nThe
    |H| and |w| may have been created by altering other letters in the same typeface
    (flip the |W| horizontally and edit the upright stroke, invert the |J| and duplicate
    part of it for the other vertical and add a crossbar). Not finding a match for
    either letter anywhere.\r\n\r\n"
