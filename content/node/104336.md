body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI am looking for an advice, or just your opinion:\r\nI use the
  font \"Flexo\" ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/durotype/flexo/ ) for all of my business-stuff
  (print and online), but I'm not completely satisfied with my online-pages look.\r\n\r\nIt's
  there: http://davidbraun.ch and http://davidbraun.ch/werkstatt\r\n\r\nShould I use
  a different font for the headlines? or rather the body? (My feeling is that flexo
  is better kept small...)\r\nWhat would you recommend?\r\nI once was very tempted
  to use emigre's vendetta, but my designer steered me away of this...\r\nAnd a bit
  later, I stumbled upon a font that was looking very much like flex, but it was a
  font of its own, and it had an italic-variant... (but totally cannot remember what
  it was...) \r\n\r\nThanks very much for your time and insights\r\n\r\ndavid"
