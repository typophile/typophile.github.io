  body: "Well, it's not Gotham Rounded (even squeezed), because the K is all wrong.
    It's not Bryant Rounded, for a few reasons, including the M. Not either of the
    Helvetica/Arial Rounded fonts.\r\n\r\nSeems I know only what it doesn't seem to
    be...\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"

    along with the rest of it. 200,000 stock designs and not one Tiger Muskie.\r\nSuch
    is my luck these days."

    Sans</a> seemed to be the closest I could find. You would only need to make your
    own K to replicate it pretty closely, and maybe a little squooshing.\r\n\r\n-
