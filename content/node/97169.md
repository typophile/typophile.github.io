  work I am looking for a nice sans-serif.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I thought it has to be
  a neutral typeface just like Helvetica and so on, so that it fits to my photography
  work \r\nas good as to my futuristic poster (just to give an example).\r\nBut I
  felt that I want a typeface which has more personality, wich has a (subtle) nice,
  warm and friendly feeling without being too decorative.\r\n\r\nOne typeface I have
  found is Pluto Sans. It looks nice to me, but the description reads that its best
  used for screens\r\n(http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/pluto-sans/). So, would
  you suggest me to use it for print?\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have any other suggestions
  I like to hear them.\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly regards,\r\nDennis"
