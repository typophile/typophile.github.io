body: "hello typeoholics.\r\n\r\ni'm designing my online portfolio in my domain \"yaronimus.com\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rwetetet3_6730.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rwetetet_6411.jpg]\r\ni
  named the site itself as \"creation space A\"\r\nabove is the sketch for the logotype,
  which containing the first letter of three languages - hebrew Aleph, arabic Aliph,
  and english A). this will appear at the site entrance page. (the fonts here are
  just for presentation).\r\n\r\nthis site will be like the homebase of my virtual
  presence, containing displays of art and design, but also a good place for experimental
  and creative process publications, and links to my other online resources like flickr,
  facebook, mail, behance, etc etc.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rwetetet2_3962.jpg]\r\nthis
  is my logo at the moment (which will also appeare in the site).\r\n\r\nmy site will
  show works by projects in a format which will be a mixture\r\nof a blog and a magazine.\r\n\r\ni'm
  looking for a font good sans-serif font for headings, which is clean and legible
  in smaller sizes (like jpg buttons in a website), but also has some nuance (lyric)
  calligraphic qualities. in a way, this font needs to bridge between minimalism and
  my works which are often characterised by calligraphy or typography.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe
  closest matches i found were italic/slanted solutions like linotype's optima nova
  (which is very expensive btw).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/heading

  body: "thanks everybody, and thanks James Deux.\r\n\r\ni don't think i have found
    what i wanted, but it's because i'm not sure.\r\n\r\nperhaps i'm looking for clean
    serif fonts with calligraphic qualities such as changes of width, but not too
    extreme (nuances of calligraphy).  a font which looks good in small sizes. maybe
    bold-italic.\r\n\r\nthanks for helping."

    of using it as a font for the main buttons on my site (jpg in small size).\r\nwhat
    is this font making you think?\r\ndo you love/hate it?\r\nwhy?\r\nwhat is the
    general social approach to this font?"
