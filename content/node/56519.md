  font improvements</a> in the works for Windows 7. Perhaps the best new feature is
  the ability to turn fonts on and off within the OS itself (no third party software
  needed). \r\n\r\nThe site linked above also has some screenshots of <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1741\">Gabriola</a>,
  a new script font for Windows. It says it has OpenType, so maybe that means MS Office
  will finally be able to take advantage those features. Can anyone confirm this?"
