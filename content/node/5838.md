    its trip through the photocopier and scanner. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/syntax/black/testdrive.html?s=Mariko%2BMori&amp;p=48"

    <BR> <BR>Thank you Marc, I believe you are right! I was looking for an &#34;a&#34;
    with a more rounded tail; too bad that feature was introduced by bad reproduction,
    that&#39;s what I liked the most about it... <BR> <BR>Cheers!'

  body: Thank you Jeremy, it&#39;s very similar indeed, I&#39;ll bookmark the page.
    I was just given the email address of the people who supposedly designed the pamphlet
    where I found it; I&#39;ll post here if I ever hear from them. Otherwise, there
    are so many font designers and small foundries that it&#39;s hard to know exactly
    where to start!
