body: hey ho, im all new around here, and a friend of my sis directed me over to this
  uber-cool place of typeness. <BR> <BR>so just a little intro, im dante. ive worked
  in the field for awhile, doing freelance projects and stuff. and now im going to
  the artcenter college of design, dying but fufilling my masochistic urges. this
  project is for my form and letterform class, where we have to make a personal logotype.
  its supposed to read &#39;ante,&#39; which is the root word of many of my nicknames.  <BR>

  so greatful! thanks!

    need to know what it says <BR>without being told or can it survive as a graphic
    <BR>mark with an obscure layer of meaning? <BR> <BR>Your glyph connections are

  body: ' the dot was a silly idea that im still debating on whether or not i should
    leave. i kinda wanted to break up the monotonous symmetry a bit without making
    it too radical, but at the same time, when you turn the logo upsidedown, it says
    &#39;aite!&#39; <BR> <BR>about the whole obscure thing, im not too sure, im getting
    really different feedback. like the ambiguity of the forms attract people, but
    then again, other people are telling me that it should first read &#39;ante&#39;
    and then the mark should come in. or something like that. '

  body: I think it would be far more readable if you didn&#39;t marry the left half  <BR>of
    the <i>n</i> into the <i>a</i>. The ambigram/inversion thing can very definitely
    <BR>work for this word. Try using the middle of the right stroke of the <i>n</i>  <BR>as
    your centre of rotation, curving left at the top as normal, and  <BR>curving into
    the <i>t</i> at the bottom, something like a cursive join. Then  <BR>the left
    stroke of the <i>n</i> can invert to the <i>t</i>. A half serif on the end  <BR>and
    a slightly descending stroke will give you your <i>t</i>.
