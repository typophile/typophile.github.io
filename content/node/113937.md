body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI have made some fonts for a client, had them hinted and produced
  as TTF by third party, and am now having them tested for use in MS Office by another
  third party. Earlier in the process, we tested the (not final) fonts for embedding
  in MS Office, and it worked out fine then. Since then, the fonts have been hinted
  and I have added a DSIG-table to make MS Office recognize them as OpenType fonts
  (the OpenType features were also in the test-fonts, but not the DSIG-table).\r\nAnd
  now, the fonts will not embed, or rather, the will embed but not show up on the
  end users screen.\r\nThe third party testing the font for MS Office suggests it's
  because MS Office will not embed fonts that it recognizes as OpenType, and we should
  therefore make some \"Office-versions\" of the fonts with no OpenType-features and
  therefore for example tabular lining numerals as default. \r\nThis makes good sense
  to me as long as MS Office really doesn't embed fonts with OpenType features, but
  is it really so? It seems odd, and a leap way back in time.\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward
  to hear your insights."

  body: "Thanks, Charles.\r\n\r\nThe fonts are however TTF fonts, and with all permissions
    given.\r\nNote that the fonts did test well in the first round, and that only
    sub pixel hinting, slightly different names (only the names, not the naming structure)
    and the addition of the DSIG-table are the changes that have been made.\r\nI have
    done some tests where I have taken the DSIG-table out of the fonts again, but
    with no positive result. The hinting doesn't seem to be the issue either, so now
    we're testing if it might be the actual name, though it doesn't seem to any dobbelg\xE4nger
    out there."
