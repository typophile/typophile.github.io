  body: "Sure,\r\n\r\nWhen you type this: i\xE5i\xE4i\xF6 with Galliard (and other
    \"older\" fonts) \u2013 you clearly see that the diacritics are very much jumping
    up and down. \r\n\r\nIn the swedish language we use these letters alot in a different
    combinations and it doesnt look good if the diacritics are not adjusted (as they
    mostly are today in \"newer\" or recently updated fonts)\r\n\r\nType i\xE5i\xE4i\xF6
    here:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=galliard\r\n\r\nAnd also
    compare Adobes garamond with other Garamonds here, on these letters.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=garamond\r\n\r\nSo
    Matthew Carter did a special Scandinavian edition of his Galliard which is called
    Galliard Scandinavian. There is a nice story behind it aswell, as told by my collegue
    Gary Newman, but he is going to tell it so much better than me so I wont even
    dare to try :)"
