Sure, their approach may raise feathers, but it&rsquo;s their right to do business as they see fit.
Whether or not one agrees with their strategy, one should encourage experiments in the mind-boggling issue of how to make a living from intellectual property in the digital era.</div>

<p>So, along with publishing the story and this guy&rsquo;s name, it&rsquo;s significantly raised the price of the font from $30 to $40 &ndash; saying that it will keep the price up until the full $944 is paid off. This is doubly stupid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to agree with this part of the equation. Why should I pay more because the last guy passed the font on? My solution is to shop somewhere else.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t agree with the rest of the article, however. If the EULA clearly stated that you can get billed for shared copies of the font (and more importantly, sharing of the copies), then the company deserves what it gets. (In fact, the company that bought the font should be sending a bill for $944 to the sign company that posted the material on the sharing site.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>At <a href="http://letterheadfonts.com/piracy/thousanddollarfont.php">http://letterheadfonts.com/piracy/thousanddollarfont.php</a> we read:</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;In order to reduce the cases of piracy, Letterhead Fonts began encrypting account data into the font files in early 2007. The information embedded into the font file allows us to track the font back to it&rsquo;s original purchaser.&quot;</cite></p>
<p>While the &ldquo;account data&rdquo; are usually &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; into the invoice to the commodity, it is unusual to &ldquo;embed&rdquo; these &ldquo;acount data&rdquo; into the commodiy itself. The interesting legal question is whether a seller of commodities is permitted at all by American laws to &ldquo;embed&rdquo; such &ldquo;account data&rdquo; into the commodities he is selling. Here two examples:</p>
<p>Example 1: A father buys a wedding ring for his daughter, and the jeweller &ldquo;embeds&rdquo; (= engraves) the father&rsquo;s &ldquo;account data&rdquo; into this ring. Is this permitted by American laws?</p>
<p>Example 2: You need a heart valve, and the surgeon &ldquo;embeds&rdquo; your &ldquo;account data&rdquo; into this valve, before he implants it. Is this permitted by American laws?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily against watermarking, but the rest makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>The watermark merely IDs the purchaser. It says nothing about the person that infringed on the copyright. It MAY have been the purchaser. It may have equally as likely NOT been the purchaser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s a shame that Letterhead are being painted as the asshole here&rdquo;</p>
<p>Say you bought a font from Adobe, then your laptop is stolen, and then Adobe says you own them $10,000 because they found the file on TorrentBay. Thoughts?</p>

<p>If I did a conceptual design for a client, got paid for the conceptual design from the client with a signed agreement: I own the rights to the conceptual design, until it is fully designed and produced.
However if the client then takes the conceptual design to another design company, they reproduced designed based on my conceptual&hellip;. I STILL CANNOT CHARGE MY OTHER CLIENTS 33% to make up for the loss&hellip; damn I wish I could.</p>
<p>or if a client goes into receivership as I had and nothing is in the tin or the office has tumbleweed, am I allowed to charge MY OTHER CLIENTS 33% to make up for the loss&hellip; no. I am sure there are many out there who too have had a client owe them a significant amount of money, for the client to then go under.. &lsquo;belly up&rsquo;.. gone. Now that really hurts&hellip; takes about x3 that amount to get it back.</p>
<p>Though if you want the typeface you will pay for it. What is worse? paying $40 for a $30 font? or seeing it on Myfonts 3 days later for 80% discount? doh!

<p>With various types of shareware, after your purchase, the vendor gives you an encrypted &lsquo;key,&rsquo; comprised of several lines of of unreadable characters, which serves to both unlock the software for use but also embeds your name and email into the software.</p>
<p>This is good at deterring the original purchaser from sharing his/her key.</p>
<p>A similar thing can be done with opentype fonts, but there is a major difference: the purchaser does not know that his name/email are encrypted into the font, or at least it&rsquo;s not visible when you click on font properties. Thus the psychological effect is weaker.</p>

Most of the implications of that elude me but I have come to a few conclusions:</p>

I am not anti-Christian at all, but I think &ldquo;bible thumper&rdquo; was a fairly well-chosen phrase.  To think that your business is, er, endorsed by GOD?  Seems blasphemous at best.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a desire for fair compensation is, in this case, counter to good marketing.  He could have appealed to people&rsquo;s sympathies by writing a not-condescending blog post that explains a bit about  what it&rsquo;s like to make fonts for a living, and how his EULA is more reasonable than others'.   Instead of a price-hike, he could have offered a $5 discount for people who have never bought a font before, and have only pirated.   What a difference that would have made!  Piraters are people who WILL NOT buy fonts, unless they feel a personal affinity with the person who created the font; seems like the kind, forgiving approach would be both more business-savvy and more, well, Christian.</p>

<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise to anyone that his rants aren&rsquo;t generating much sympathy from the consumer masses. I can&rsquo;t speak for Haley but to me the bible-thumping isn&rsquo;t a turn-off in terms of him being religious, but rather a turn off in the sense that &lsquo;God is on my side&rsquo; which is an argument used by some rather notorious historical figures to do things that, I&rsquo;m sure, any god wouldn&rsquo;t be too happy about.*</p>

<p>Patty made a negative personal remark about Chuck. Okay&mdash;let it stand, but there is no need to supress Patty&rsquo;s remark by expressing your revulsion. This is how incivility starts and escalates, and typographic discussions get turned into train wrecks. One comment pointing out the nature of Patty&rsquo;s remark is all that&rsquo;s required. Thankyou, you can all stop now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with Patty&rsquo;s remark about Chuck either, but I defend to the death her right to say it, and her right not to be made a victim of personal remarks made about her.</p>
<p>Patty&mdash;would you like to post an apology? It&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>Sending you all good vibes. Have a better day, I&rsquo;ll be thinking of you all while I finish Pyke&rsquo;s Peak (new font).</p>
<p>Take care :^)</p>

<p>I agree with much of what you are saying, but I think the community as a whole, also has the right to speak out against offensive comments, just as Patty has the right to voice her opinion. As long as we remain civil and not make personal attacks against each other, everything posted in these forums is fair game.</p>

Living in the heart of the US bible belt I&rsquo;ve learned to be very wary of people that profess their christianity with words rather than acts. Letterhead is reinforcing that lesson. It&rsquo;s not the pirating &ldquo;punk&rdquo; that is going to put Letterhead out of business. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;screw the paying customer&rdquo; reaction to the punk that is going to put them out of business.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I didn&rsquo;t find Chuck&rsquo;s religious comment the least bit offensive. It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s threatening the bullies with eternal damnation.
It was a few brief words at the end of a long and thoughtful essay which systematically addressed the issues.</p>
<p>Secure yourself to heaven, indeed, because you won&rsquo;t get much moral support any other way.
Sure, people here will sympathisize if you&rsquo;re pirated, but if you don&rsquo;t adopt the victim role, who is going to support you?
Not the state, as this kind of digital shoplifting is a petty crime that&rsquo;s never prosecuted.
There is a lack of support from Typophiles, otherwise critical of piracy, who seem to resent that Letterhead would disrupt their workflow&ndash;even if they&rsquo;re not a customer.
Then there are the information-wants-to-be-free folk, who think that everybody is guilty to some extent (well, all their peers are doing it), therefore it&rsquo;s OK to sin, and anyone who thinks otherwise is a fuddy-duddy.</p>
<p>In general, people who rock the boat do alienate some (especially the status quo), but they also garner respect from others, so it&rsquo;s not necessarily bad business to step out of line. The digital marketplace is big enough.</p>

However, the charge to make up lost revenue calculated by how many downloads counted is crazy, why not just make up a number as I am sure his fonts have been shared elsewhere and call it a clean $100 a font for the next 5 years.</p>
<p>to my clients:</p>
<p>Dear clients old, new and potential,
it has been brought to my attention that a current client has taken one of conceptual designs and used it without paying. Therefore we will be charging all old, new and potential 33.3% until we feel the potential earnings have been paid off.</p>
<p>I really love this, I know I have said it before as above though how great, it would bring awareness to stealing conceptual designs. And I would 1- get wealthy fast, 2- go out of business overnight probably during the day. I think just posting the clients name all over the website should do it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The only issue with posting the clients name is that he/she may not be the culprit. What if either someone who works for him or a printer who did a job for him was the dirty dealer? The client is then only guilty of assuming honesty among his workers. As for making other customers pay for the crimes of another, it is like arresting all of your customers who come into your bank the day after the bank was robbed. They didn&rsquo;t commit the crime but &ldquo;someone&rdquo; has to pay for it so if you can&rsquo;t find the guilty, charge the innocent just because they are conveniently located.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Is it possible that Chuck is just using this one soul - to set an example. To let his purchasers realize that they are responsible for the security of their purchase and not let it &ldquo;get around the net.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turns my own stomach when I see libraries of font manufacturers tossed up on a site like the one Chuck pointed out. I can remember struggling as a typographer in New York - always having to buy the latest, newest font for my Alphatype shop. I remember the huge financial burden I took upon myself in 1989-1991 in buying digitized fonts for MAC for the shop.</p>
<p>No one could ever tell me just how many brands of Garamond I needed to please the old typesetting customers who 1) thanked me when they could do it themselves and 2) to this day still call trying to figure out what font they used way back when&hellip;.</p>
<p>For those of us that have spent our money on fonts we have an understanding. I have said this before, and it still baffles me - the kid at home with a computer - can pluck more fonts from more manufacturers for their computer without paying for it - and imagine- today have a larger (and yes, better) collection of fonts then Photolettering did back in its heyday!</p>
<p>Chuck is doing something unorthodox. Something we are not use to and we have not seen before. Yes, there may be reasons, as business persons, we don&rsquo;t believe in it. Many of us are not bible-thumpers &ndash; but in this country weren&rsquo;t we taught to respect all religions - regardless?</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m up on a soapbox here &ndash; viva la FREEDOM OF SPEECH &ndash; the right to bear arms &ndash; and of course free business enterprise.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m at it - take a moment to thank a military person these days&hellip;</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s not that simple. this is a rather silly and misinformed characterization of many people with many different ideas about what property and reproduction mean in the digital age. the most cogent arguments i&rsquo;ve heard have nothing to do with &ldquo;everybody&rsquo;s doing it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in the middle here, btw - NOT one of your &ldquo;informationwantstobefree&rdquo; folk. 
i buy my fonts and i don&rsquo;t give them away, but i will not be shopping at letterhead anymore, in protest to what i see as a completely regressive and counter-productive move on this playing field.</p>
