    z from Matthew Carter&#39;s Fenway &#40;when I was typesetting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1932026010/qid=1059946884/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-4746766-5987046?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846"><i>Language
    Culture Type</i></a>, Matthew sent me a replacement, non-descending glyph for
    the lowercase <i>z</i>, which I believe is now the standard Fenway form&#41;.

    ampersand doesn&#39;t have such a steep curve on right side of the top loop. And
    with this crop you&#39;d see a bit of the horizontal terminating cross-stroke.
