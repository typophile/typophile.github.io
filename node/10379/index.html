At least FontLab is still free from being stored in the warehouse next to the Ark of the Covenant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How many times has Adobe ended up owning Freehand now? Two? Three? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It would be nice if Adobe got the Macromedia product teams to pay the same attention to detail to their code that they do to their own. Dreamweaver is a sluggish, kludgy mess on the Mac, and the last time I tried to use Freehand, I gave up in disgust after like 5 minutes. (I remember when Freehand was much easier and more fun to use than Illustrator, but I guess that predates Macromedia's acquisition of it by a while. 4.x was the last version I really liked.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And both companies are a pain when it comes to the cycle of annual, painfully expensive product upgrades. At least Adobe writes reasonably speedy, usable software; maybe that will rub off on Macromedia.

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding Fontographer: it is very unlikely indeed that Adobe's purchase of Macromedia will lead to a new version of Fontographer. It is much more likely that the produce will be retired completely, and will simply no longer be available. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The history of Fontographer and FontLab has shown very clearly that for a large software company like Macromedia or Adobe a font tool is simply not worth development investment. The potential market is simply too small to interest them. Font tools need to be developed by small companies seeking a niche market, and FontLab has demonstrated that this approach can be very successful. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suggested some years ago that Macromedia should simply give the Fontographer code, including the aborted 5.0 version, to Jim Gallagher. He has spent a good portion of his life nursing this code and providing tech support to Fontographer users, so if there is any future to Fontographer it seems to me that he deserves to guide it and to benefit from it, if possible. Perhaps Adobe might consider this. They have been generously supportive of the makers of FontLab, DTL FontMaster, etc., with their OpenType SDK code, so clearly encourage competition in the font tools business. Giving Fontographer to Jim for a dollar, and letting him do whatever he wants with it &ndash; which might include open sourcing it, I suppose &ndash; seems to me the best thing that could be done with this product. Otherwise, it might as well be withdrawn from the market, because it is never going to be updated by Adobe or any other large software company.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the suggestion that Adobe might give the Fog code to Jim Gallagher. Poor fellow! He's spent years lobbying Macromedia without success, and now he has to start over with a new set of corporate goons. But as for Adobe <em>giving</em> away anything away? Je crois que non.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Otherwise I think it's very bad news. Competition is the only thing that makes products good. Apple has proved this again and again: how it is possible to do things that really do make it worthwhile to pay twice as much for a computer. For those who can afford it, it's a very nice situation. Photoshop has been in strong need of competition for years, and it is striking that nobody seems to be able to get in there and do it. Illustrator is now even more likely to stagflate, I fear, having taken its best recent ideas, now 8 or so years old, from LightningDraw GX. What a pity that Corel couldn't do a better job. Or Macromedia, for that matter.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I find it interesting that Quark 6.5 now has considerable Photoshop-like functionality, and this is only bound to increase. One can see clearly that the competition from InDesign has strongly benfitted Quark. Remember the dizzy days when Quark nearly took over Adobe?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's striking that so much of the reaction I've seen in the press is about the business end of the deal, and almost none of it is how the users of the software, in particular creators, are affected by it. The same weird sense of disconnect haunts me when I read the interview with the CEO in PC Magazine. The SF Chronicle was talking about how the combined Acromedia can shove more &quot;interactive content&quot; (read: &quot;ads&quot;) at &quot;consumers&quot; (read: &quot;poor suckers&quot;, namely us) with the Flash / Acrobat juggernaut. In businesslandia, this seems to be seen as a win, rather than a horrible lose / lose situation for all of us. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Am I being needlessly gloomy? Are all of us here? Am I unreasonable for being disappointed by a situation in which I can pay $500 a year for the kinds of improvements that used to be given away for free in incremental updates, now that the tools I use are mature platforms, and I have no viable alternatives to choose from if I grow discontented with what I've got? I use Adobe CS because I think Adobe's tools are the best out there for what they do, but still, as CS becomes more like Microsoft Office for Designers, it would be nice if there was more competition to push things forward.</div>

If the end is &quot;good software&quot;, is it OK to pursue that end by means of a monopoly? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No, because that amount of power corrupts. It's not that the people in the companies &quot;know they have no competition&quot; and deliberately produce sloppy product. It just happens when all the power is concentrated in one place. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If the market, in the form of competition, or government, in the form of the Securities Commission (or whatever) is not going to keep the system in balance, that's a problem. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it doesn't matter how brilliant or well intentioned people are, or what wonders they have achieved in the past, they go bad if they acquire too much power.

		<div class="commentbody">It's true that flash is a platform now. Remember how hard Apple (Quicktime) and Microsoft (Windows Media) have been fighting to establish and control the de facto video player for the web? While they weren't looking Macromedia snuck in an took it with the flash player. Macromedia didn't even begin to exploit the power they had over the media market. I really doubt if Adobe cares much about Macromedia's apps. They want to control the platform that now defines media on the web, and if it works out like they think, will define mobile space as well.
