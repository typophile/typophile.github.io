  was usually dismissed because considered the Logo was considered custom designed,
  but I just fed the Logo in www.myfonts.com 'what the font' engine and it neatly
  outputed this typeface ... I'd say a 95% match of the logo.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_5251.gif]"

    Golden Book Magazine from the 1920s. I don't know how old the Gucci logo is. Maybe
    Mark can shed some light on the subject.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I think it has certainly been revamped. Tom Ford presented his first Gucci
    Collection in 1995, also the Group went public that year and from there on the
    brand evolved as a global fashion brand. They certainly had some Art Director
    working on it to make it look more elegant and slicker. Here's a older logo.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-4_6077.gif]"

  body: "I'd like to add that I'm really happy to have found this font.\r\n\r\nWe
    once worked on a logo design for Yves Saint Laurent 'Cinema' perfume and lost
    the pitch to Art Director Thomas Lenthal who used Optima as proposed Logo. I fully
    understand why he had chosen Optima, it is very classical (so coherent with the
    clients brief who wanted to go for a 30's kind of glamour), slim and elegant,
    but only if seen from far, I think the Optima is dead ugly when you see it from
    close, it has those curvy lines which make it look kinda sloppy and of little
    formal value. Goldenbook would have delivered the same 30's galmour message but
    with much more typographic rigour. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-3_4245.gif]"

    Who is forbidding you to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/goldenbook/\">pay
    $29 for this font</a> if I may ask?"

    rights.
