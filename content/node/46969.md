body: 'The sample image is from Cooks Illustrated. It''s from a PDF of an article,
  and the PDF lists various weights of Gill (including an extra light weight, which
  I have not been able to track down) in its metadata. The lower case a and t and
  the round dot on the i (in most cuts of Gill Sans Light it is a square dot) are
  giveaways that it is not a common cut of Gill Sans. Any ideas? '

  body: Open Gill Sans light in a font editor, trim some weight with <change weight
    command> and electronically condense it thus destroying the rhythm of the face.
    Than take the point off the "t", change the square dots for round ones (same as
    bold cuts of Gill sans) and generally dick about with the design. Close and save
    as a new exclusive cut of Gill. Hope that Eric Gill doesn't rise from his grave
    and beat you senseless with a two pond zinc letter cutting dummy
