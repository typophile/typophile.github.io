body: "This was posted today on cyberscribes and I thought it quite appropriate given
  recent discussions.\r\n\r\nTHE BOOK of LETTERS \r\nIn the beginning there was silence
  and there was no understanding. And then \r\nman spoke and there was noise. And
  man called this noise language and said\r\n\"This is my Language in which I am well
  pleased, and I shall have no other \r\nlanguages before it.\u201D But Language went
  forth and multiplied.\r\nAnd so it was that Proto-Indo-European begat Balto-Slavic,
  Germanic, Celtic, \r\nItalic, Illyrian,Albanian, Thracian, Hellenic, Armenian, Phrygian,
  Anatolian, \r\nIndo-Iranian and Tocharian and then died of exhaustion & was forgotten.
  \r\nAnd it came to pass that Balto-Slavic subdivided and became Baltic and Slavic
  \r\nand the number of their begating was three .... but \r\nthe languages of Slavic
  were fruitful and multiplied, went condo and ate up \r\nthe languages of Baltic.\r\n\r\nHellenic
  begat Greek and Italic begat Latin and had many other languages and \r\nwas eaten
  by its off-spring. Latin begat and begat and begat which was all \r\nvery Romantic.\r\n\r\nAnd
  Germanic Begat Anglo-Saxon which had an illicit relationship with Norman \r\nFrench,
  the illegitimate off-spring of Old French and a Northern Dialect of \r\nGermanic,
  & begat Middle English. And Middle English became vague and begat \r\nEnglish, a
  language which even its own speakers do not speak. And so Language \r\nmultiplied
  until the peoples of the earth could not understand themselves, and \r\nthere was
  no understanding.\r\n\r\nThere were in that same land Calligraphers and Scribes,
  and they said \u201CLet \r\nthere be an Alphabet that we may grow and prosper.\u201D
  and so there was an \r\nAlphabet. Now in that Alphabet there were letters and unto
  each letter there was one \r\nsound, or two sounds, or three sounds, or two letters
  for one sound and this \r\ngreatly pleased the Calligraphers and Scribes for no
  others could read it. And \r\nso they grew and prospered.\r\n\r\nNow each Language
  took unto itself an Alphabet except Latin. Latin took unto \r\nitself the Greek
  alphabet, and after changing a few letters for copyright \r\nprotection, called
  it Roman and inflicted unto the far reaches of the world, even \r\nunto Cleveland
  in the far west.\r\n\r\nAnd the Calligraphers and Scribes conspired together and
  said \u201CNow there is \r\nan Alphabet there must be something to write.\u201D
  and so they invented Literature. \r\nNow those among the Calligraphers and Scribes
  who produced Literature called \r\nthemselves Authors. And the Authors waxed powerful
  among the Calligraphers and \r\nScribes for their writings were as numerous as the
  forms of the IRS and about \r\nas understandable. And those who could not express
  themselves in their native \r\nlanguage quoted important passages in foreign languages
  and when pressed to \r\nexplain their eccentricities exclaimed \u201CI know how
  to write, let others learn \r\nto read.\u201D And those amongst the Calligraphers
  and Scribes who were not Authors \r\ngrew sore afraid; so they invented Critics.\r\n\r\nThen
  arose Joyce, a great one amongst the authors, who spoke for many hours \r\nof many
  things and many were there among those present that drifted off to \r\nsleep. There
  was one present who, after sleeping for many hours, awoke and found \r\nthat Joyce
  was still speaking and this so greatly disturbed his waking thoughts \r\nthat he
  emitted a piercing shriek and ran from the chamber. And thus it was \r\nthat the
  Scream of Consciousness became an integral part of Joyce's style.\r\n\r\nBut there
  were those amongst the Calligraphers and Scribes who could speak \r\nbut plainly.
  And they, wishing to share in rich spoils of confused thinking \r\narose early in
  the afternoon worked for many minutes and invented Statistics, and \r\nMarketing
  Surveys, and after a three martini dinner did they invent jargon. \r\nAnd thus did
  \u201CMethod\u201D become \u201CMethodology\u201D and even the paradigm of \u201Cparadigm\u201D\r\nshifted
  and so did plain speaking become confused and plain speakers became \r\ngreat by
  proving whatever they willed. And they called themselves Bureaucrats \r\nand worshiped
  at the Bottom Line.\r\n\r\nThen came forth out of this wilderness a prophet unto
  the Elders among the \r\nCalligraphers and Scribes, even unto the High Author and
  Chief Bureaucrat, and \r\ndemanded of them explanations of their deeds. And the
  Elders answered him in \r\nword both wise and wonderful and almost entirely content
  free. And the prophet \r\nsaid unto them \u201CSpeak not to me in words of flowing
  rhetoric for I come from \r\nthe wilderness where I was Illuminating the Letters
  of the Law and yea, I can \r\nrecognize the droppings of male bovines when they
  are displayed before me.\u201D And \r\nthey Answered him speaking such words as
  are not to be recorded in Holy Books.\r\n\r\nAnd again he spoke, saying \u201CLo,
  it is written, for I have written it, that \r\none shall come forth from the wilderness
  and found a new order amongst the \r\nscribes. Behold, here am I.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd
  these be the words of the Prophet: \u201CYea, though I speak the words of \r\nangels
  or the words of corruption yet shall they be considered wise; and yea, \r\nthough
  I walk uprightly amongst men or wind sideways through the sand on my belly, \r\nyet
  shall I be respected, and yea, though my ancestry be of noble kin or that \r\nof
  the barracuda and shark yet shall I be honored above all; for I am a \r\nLawyer.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd
  so it came to pass that there was much wailing, and an outcry was \r\nheard throughout
  the world, and there was much litigation, but there was still \r\nno understanding.\r\nAuthor

  body: "<strong>Sum up:</strong> Potted history of letters condenses the history
    of language and writing into a mind-tickling 864 words using mock biblical tone
    and quasi-ecclesiastical parlance. Writing style lives life on the Deuterocanonical
    side of the Old Testament, relying heavily on capitalized key words and the kind
    of atrophied orthography begat by the changeover from Indo-Germanic to Latin,
    verifying that ancient scholars made a golden turkey of an error when they swapped
    the \"Th\" fu\xFEark rune for the Latin \"Y\" glyph, merely because the latter
    looked just like the \"Th\" fu\xFEark rune. If only pre-Latin-speaking peoples
    had gone about saying, \"Yea\". Except they didn't. In reality they went about
    saying \"The\", but their scholars let them down with that slip-shod glyph substitution,
    creating the enduring falsehood of \"Yea\".\r\nSorry, where was I? Oh yeah, the
    review. Narrative thread makes out a case for the history of language being convoluted
    and rather corrupt. The author is correct, it really did develop that way. Humankind
    starts off bereft of understanding, invents language, then languages, writing,
    literature, and finally bureaucrats, ad men and lawyers. Humankind winds up bereft
    of understanding in the end. The author has a point. Language sets out to demystify
    the human condition, only to obfuscate it. More people need to read this stuff.\r\n<strong>For:</strong>
    Veracity of story, endearing cast of characters.\r\n<strong>Against:</strong>
    Not entirely convincing ecclesiastical linguistic aspiration.\r\n<strong>Spec
    notes:</strong> Hyphenation and comma omissions compromise rhythm and pacing,
    but not too seriously. Numerous references to U.S place names and culture give
    away the writer as being in all likelihood a U.S citizen.\r\n<strong>Rivals:</strong>
    No, sorry, nothing springs to mind unless you count works by Coolhand McLuhan.\r\n<strong>Also
    Try:</strong> The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Literature\">Wikipedia
    Literature portal</a> because the articles are really very good.\r\n<strong>Rating:</strong>
    Three and a half stars.\r\n<strong>My choice:</strong> Yes please. I enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nj

    do my best to inject humour into Typophile, and at least half of Typophile's regular

    Probably many of Typophile's readers have a good laugh offline, but in cyberspace
    nobody can hear you laugh.\r\n\r\nOh no it's half past one in the morning again.

  body: "Does it betray my incurable lack of humour when I confess that of all the
    things, my attention was drawn to the reference to Balto-Slavic and Michael's
    subsequent comment on the 'unexplained disappearance of Baltic'? Balto-Slavic
    is a hypothetical grouping and there is no compelling evidence that they ever
    formed a single group. Also, the demise of the Baltic languages has been somewhat
    exaggerated, as Latvian and Lithuanian at least are very much alive.\r\n\r\nThat
    and the fact that the invention of language in this history apparently concerns
    only those of the Indo-European family."

  body: How sad. I certainly saw no reason to check on the historical facts - already
    new it would be just a fictitious story twisted to be funny - which it is. Relax,
    have some fun and a laugh. You will feel better for it.
