  body: "I would be inclined to say that none of them work well enough to be tolerable.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    in the old days, people did put up with typewritten copy, and it was readable
    enough. And there were a couple of typestyles for the Selectric, such as Bookface
    Academic and Diplomat, which even resembled serif typefaces.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure
    that they're equalled by any monospaced typeface currently available, since now
    that proportional spacing is easy, monospaced typefaces are intended to look like
    typewriter faces so as to contrast with normal typefaces.\r\n\r\nEDIT: There may
    be some choices out there.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mvb-fantabular/medium/]]\r\nresembles
    Diplomat;\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/alix-fb/]]\r\nresembles
    Prestige Elite;\r\n\r\nLucida Typewriter seems to be worth consideration as well.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Oops! In going through MyFonts, I ended up finding two Nick already mentioned!\r\n\r\nThis
    one didn't turn up in my search:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-schoolbook/century-schoolbook-monospaced-10058/]]\r\n\r\nbut
    while the glyphs look all right, there appears to be too much spacing between
    the letters to make it a good choice."
