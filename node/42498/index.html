  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It looks like my partner and I might end up moving to New York after I graduate. I am concerned about the job market in New York; I get the impression things in New York are extremely competitive, and I’m not sure that <a href="http://jpad.biz/design.html">my own work</a> is good enough to get me a job that’s any better than what I already have here in DC. On the other hand, what I would learm from grad school in New York and be involved with the New York AIGA could be really great for me.</p>
<p>I am also concerned about the intensity of work in New York. I don’t mind working hard, but I have limits; when I was younger I worked enough to put myself in a hospital—twice. I also need free time to keep working on type design outside of work. So working seven days a week at an agency isn’t really an option.</p>
<p>Is getting hired and working in New York as crazy as some people make it out to be? Can I expect to find a good 40-hour a week job in New York?</p>

Some weeks you will do 35-40 hours, other weeks it will be more, as James M. has said.</div>

And it is very very competitive. I&rsquo;m sure there are less intense agencies in the outer limits of the city but I think the feeling is people generally go to New York to work at the best places and the quality of jobs there reflect that.</p>
<p>But New York is pretty much the most awesome city in the world.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">If you like that environment, you may want to try to crack the editorial design world. Lots and lots of magazines are published in the NYC area. Someone is always getting fired, so there is usually some good turnover. You may try to get your foot in the door doing freelance production layouts. When it comes to closing time, most magazines staff up for a week or so to help with the crunch. Most of these are filled via the recruitment agencies Ricardo mentions above. If you don&rsquo;t have a strong editorial portfolio the freelance production route may be your only option to get in.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ricardo, Some mags pay well, other not so good. Consumer vs Trade. Trade book staffs are smaller, but tend to pay OK. Staff positions below art director on a consumer book are usually fairly low paying, but freelance help generally gets reasonable rates, put usually for production rather than layout.  I spent most of the 80s working in the magazine business and had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Brooklyn is quickly becoming too expensive for newcomers to the city, but if James P&rsquo;s partner is an attorney that shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</p>
<p>There are very few places in NYC where you will do much type design or lettering unless you work for a font development studio.</p>
<p>We are not hiring, I don&rsquo;t know about the other NYC font folks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">James, if you&rsquo;re concerned about hours, don&rsquo;t join a studio or ad agency. I made that decision at the start of my career and never wavered. And I always had time for extras. Your best bet is as design director for a company or major non-profit, doing a bit of everything. My last staff position, before going freelance, was as art director at the national headquarters of Planned Parenthood, doing over 200 jobs of every description yearly, including divisional magazines I designed from scratch, two different annual reports, books, brochures, special event stuff&ndash;the gamut. So if you yourself don&rsquo;t need to make six figures, non-profit is actually more satisfying creatively than many companies. And you can job search right now from your computer, including the top design employment agencies.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve never lived in the NYC but I do know how competitive the market there is.  Much like Mondo has mentioned, I worked as the creative director at a start-up in Atlanta, Ga that blew through it&rsquo;s capital way too fast.  However it was one of the most fun rewarding experiences of my life and I&rsquo;ve got a tone of portfolio work out of it.  My point is, try to find a small, mid-level or a start-up that&rsquo;s actually going somewhere.  It&rsquo;s better than being a wage slave with no power or input what-so-ever.  Plus in a few years you&rsquo;ll be one of those people who can say &ldquo;I remember when&hellip;&rdquo; all the time.</p>
