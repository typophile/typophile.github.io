  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">We are a small firm of 6 people &#40;including 2 designers &amp; 1 creative director&#41;, and we are trying to get our hands on a policy/procedure manual to streamline our work process a little better and to make it easier and more thorough to hire &amp; train new artists. We have searched everywhere and cannot find anything official, or not, for this.  What do your companies &#40;of any size&#41; use to standardize your art department and make sure everything gets done properly? We want it to be all inclusive and include things from e-mail and file format procedures, to documenting procedures, and everything in between. Even if you have tidbits, we could combine &amp; edit them to create an overall manual. Please HELP me!  What does eveyone use for this?!?!  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#34;<i>What do your companies &#40;of any size&#41; use to standardize your art department and make sure everything gets done properly?</i>&#34; <BR> <BR>A combination of personal experience and knowledge, a bit of <a href="http://www.identityworks.com/tools/manuals.html">stuff gleaned from other groups</a>, and a generous dash of logic and a willingness to experiment. <BR> <BR>Really, it&#39;s more about having a comprehensive view of what you want to do, and then writing it all down. Then, to make a guide, you distill it all to its core elements, with an eye towards the end-users &#40;designers&#41;. I know this sounds like a lot of high-level talk, but it&#39;s true. <BR> <BR>In terms of day-to-day job process, there are many models to choose from. A lot of it depends on whether you have/need a traffic manager &#40;or &#39;controller&#39;&#41; to manage the flow of jobs. Do you want your CD to be in the center &#40;all jobs pass through them and are proofed by them&#41; or do you want them to exercise a more casual autonomy &#40;they monitor jobs at their leisure&#41;? <BR> <BR>What you&#39;re asking for is pretty big, and also tends to be specific to the people/ jobs/ environment. I can&#39;t go into too much detail &#40;I&#39;m at work right now&#41;, but I&#39;d first break the project into A&#41; style guide B&#41; process guide C&#41; roles and responsibilities D&#41; Resources and capabilities. This might make it easier to understand and to manage. <BR> <BR>I do not run my own company &#40;I work at one and freelance&#41;, but the one I&#39;m in did a <i>major</i> process overhaul and a bit of a rebrand recently, so I&#39;m drawing from these experiences.</div>

Setting a standard for a job that can be applied to all jobs, for example &#40;this is for print but can be adapted&#41;, create a folder for each client, then, for each job create a folder which contains your final artwork file &#40;Quark or InDesign&#41; with folders containing collateral &#40;vector files, Photoshop files, fonts, pdfs sent to client, old versions of the job&#41;. If you have a job number system use this to name the folder &#40;1234 </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am sorry, I guess I was a little unclear.  We already know pretty much how to do everything &#40;we do it all pretty much exactly like you just said, Tim&#41;.  What we are really looking for is a  document/manual that covers a much broader range: all different types of jobs &amp; procedures--from things that come up every day, to things that only come up a few times a year.  Of course we realize we will have to customize this to us.  We are really looking for more of a template or example that we can adapt to our firm that might include things we might have forgotten, instead of us just writing it as we go and adding things as we think of them. I know this is a big thing to ask for, but surely some company out there has a document of this sort? One that is all inclusive that we could change and tweak to fit different firms? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oh, boy -- 2 designers and a creative director? IMO spare yourself the huge task of creating a piece such as you describe and let your CD simply instruct the designers on a personal level. Anything you commit to print could end up a nightmare, or at best paint you into a corner. I would go to print only as a last resort. I speak from experience as Polaroid&#39;s first design director who set up their art and production departments. Top brass wanted style manuals but we were too busy to do one.  <BR></div>
