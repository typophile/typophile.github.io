  throwing me for a loop. This was used on an old guitar amplifier in the '70s ([[http://vasinguitaramp.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dumbleoverdrivespecial60_7.jpg|example]]).
  It's in the same vein as Letraset's [[http://www.letraset.com/products/404-Data-70/|Data
  70]] as well as [[http://www.urbanfonts.com/fonts/Checkbook.htm|Checkbook]] (loosely).
  I've hunted through Dafont, House Industries, Google images, etc. and have come
  across a few in a similar style but the real thing is still eluding me. I'm looking
  at the capital \"V\" and \"M\" in \"VOLUME\"\u2014especially the serifs on the \"M\"
  and the fact that that both letters are oblique while the rest are straight. Anyone
  have any ideas?\r\n"

  body: "@typodermic\u2014The middle chassis in the link you posted would be the one.
    The one on the far right is using Checkbook or something similar (I don't know
    how long that one's been around). Let's see if these examples show up better (apparently
    tripod doesn't want folks direct linking).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://vasinguitaramp.tripod.com/imagelib/sitebuilder/misc/show_image.html?linkedwidth=actual&linkpath=http://vasinguitaramp.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dumbleoverdrivespecial60_7.jpg&target=tlx_new&title=Dumble%20Overdrive%20Special%2060%20Punching%20hole%20detail\">VOLUME</a>\r\n\r\n<a

    Panel</a>\r\n\r\n@idiotcountry\u2014Thanks for setting me on the right path. I
    found Otto Mason SH (essentially Automation) as a Truetype. Do you have the Solotype
    book? I was looking at the Solopedia and it says there are four variations of
    Automation. I'd love to see them if you can post a scan. Looking at the amp chassis
    pics above, some letters are close (or are correct) to Otto Mason SH but there
    are others like the \"O\" and \"D\" that aren't correct. Those actually look closer
    to something like Checkbook. I wonder if the original amp builder just cobbled
    the font together from a couple resources. If it comes down to it, I can use both
    to create the words I need, then just tweak in Illustrator. "

  body: The 'D' from Otto Mason (Automation) isn't correct. It's slanted. On your
    faceplate, it's vertical. As is the letter 'Y' - among others. I'm guessing Otto
    Mason was modified from the original?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/automation_samples_4743.jpg]

  body: "No Idea. You're right about the \"D\". I was going back and forth with too
    many typefaces when I posted. I saw the four variations for Automation (outlined,
    rimmed, shadowed and standard) from the Solotype catalog at google books. I was
    hoping they were more about character alternates but no dice. I'm just going to
    just start with Otto Mason as the primary face and take some cues from some of
    the others to create the words I need. Found an interesting discourse on the original
    videogame typefaces that I thought was kind of interesting...shows some other
    typefaces used from the era:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thevideogametext.com/vgt/micresque"
