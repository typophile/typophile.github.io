  body: "Sorry, I should have figured it was asked about here before.\r\n\r\nThe funny
    thing is, before giving up and posting, I was thinking it was a Village font and
    looked around their site for a while, but just couldn't find it. I even saw Crank
    8 on the list of fonts, but it seemed like the \"a\" in the name \"Crank\" didn't
    match so I didn't bother to look more closely at the font. I guess the fax distorted
    it more than I realized.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks Patty!"
