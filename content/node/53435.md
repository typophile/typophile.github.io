    wasn't *that* easy \u2026 the a, k, and w differ. \r\nI am officially hanging
    my head in shame."

  body: The typeface and the treatment are looking very Helvetica international 60s
    style. So why they didn't use Helvetica instead of being "that smart". Sick grafic
    designers, haha.

  body: So? Swiss/International style was more than Helvetica. And Unica <em>is</em>
    "very Helvetica looking international 60s style", just without being Helvetica
    (and without being as overused as that). I think it's great.
