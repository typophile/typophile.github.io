  for some information, I found this site so I thought I&#39;d ask: <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  been asked to design a font for a company to be used by them exclusively and I have
  no idea what to charge. I&#39;m sure it depends on the company&#39;s size and income,
  it&#39;s a broadcast company with its own cable network so it&#39;s fairly sizable.
  I&#39;ve been designing for over 15 years, logos, lettering etc. but haven&#39;t
  come across this yet...so I&#39;m looking for some input <BR> <BR>I would also be
  hiring someone to finalize the art in Fontographer, so I suppose my question concerns
  what my design fee should be, and what production on Fontographer would cost <BR>
  <BR>any info ASAP would be most appreciated... <BR> <BR>thanks for your time, <BR>Edwin

  body: 'Edwin, <BR> <BR>A quality custom typeface is obviously worth a lot more than
    just the time spent making it.  A good source of pricing information is the Graphic
    Artists Guild Handbook.  I have the 9th &#40;1997&#41; edition.   <BR> <BR>It
    suggests that typeface design &#40;with exclusivity of use&#41; is usually priced
    within the following ranges: <BR> <BR>If client is a &#34;manufacturer&#34;: <BR>one
    style &amp; weight: $2500 - $10000 <BR>2 styles, 4 weights: $3750 - $15000 <BR>
    <BR>If client is a &#34;magazine&#34;: <BR>one style &amp; weight: $1250 - $5000
    <BR>2 styles, 4 weights: $1900 - $7500 <BR> <BR>These are just guidelines, and
    it doesn&#39;t expound on exactly what it means by &#34;manufacturer&#34; and
    &#34;magazine&#34;.  Perhaps the former refers to companies that will get more
    secondary use out of the font. <BR> <BR>Paul'

  body: I agree, generally, with Paul, with the inevitable caveat that the Pricing
    Guidelines book is always so broad.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d estimate betwen $4k-$7k
    per font, per weight. That means the Roman would be one font, the bold a second,
    and the italic a third.  This range, of course, can fluctuate based on the client&#39;s
    industry and size. <BR> <BR>Oft times clients don&#39;t have a concept of what
    custom type creation costs, and can be scared away once they see cost. That&#39;s
    where you have a sales opportunity - Design the Roman, and then do the Italic
    later down the road when more revenue frees up. <BR> <BR>

  body: I think $4K/weight is generally too high, unless you&#39;re a big name. The
    lower end of Paul&#39;s numbers is more realistic these days. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'How about rights to exclusivity? Isn&#39;t it common for designers to charge
    a fee for each year of use? Or am I dreaming? I suppose it depends on the agreement
    and the clients intended use and more specifically, length of that use. '

  body: 'If we&#39;re talking generally, pricing a font is determined by the following
    variables: <BR> <BR>1. Completeness of font character set <BR>2. Term of exclusivity
    <BR>3. Breadth of family weights <BR> <BR>From this information you can determine
    how to dial the price up or down. Let&#39;s say you decide to charge $2,500 for
    one weight of a font. Then you find out they want every character slot filled,
    add $1,000. Then they tell you that they want exclusive rights for 2 years, add
    $2,000. They want two weights of the font, so another $1,000 to $2,000 for each
    weight depending on the amount of work invovled. <BR> <BR>There is a level of
    techincal completeness that is expected, like kerning, but beyond that realm are
    things like delta hinting if they want that stuff have your FOG buddy quote that
    stuff. <BR> <BR>When a font is commissioned, it always remains the property of
    its creator and the company who purchases it essentially owns the right to use
    the font for a period of time exclusively then it&#39;s assumed you may offer
    the font for sale publicly at the end of the terms of the agreement. <BR> <BR>The
    only other exception to the rule is if they want the font for buyout which means
    you double the price. <BR> <BR>In every case, make sure you attach SOME legal
    documentation with your completed font that states the terms of use as well as
    the proper license for your font. Check out a few license agreements from foundries
    to get the jist of it. <BR> <BR>If you don&#39;t include that document, you basically
    lose protection of the face and allow them to do whatever they want to with it
    including selling copies of it without your permission. <BR> <BR>If you have a
    client that will renew a license annually, great! otherwise, it&#39;s much easier
    to define the project at the beginning including terms of extending your agreement
    with them. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps! <BR>Stuart :D'
