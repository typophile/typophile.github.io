  body: It's a frame garb from the title sequence of "Targets" (1968) starring Boris
    Karloff. I'm suspecting it's an alternate version of Swiss 721 Black Extended
    - except, as I said, for the R & G.

  body: 1968? That rules out Swiss 721 Black Extended completely, as this is Bitstream's
    digital version of Helvetica and Bitstream didn't even exist back then. This indeed
    matches Annonce Gothic -- except for the G of course. Berthold Venus has a similar
    spurless G, but some other key characteristics like the angled finials don't match.
