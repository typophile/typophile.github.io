    target="_blank">Bitsumishi</a> which was mentioned in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/55163.html?1102254702"
    target="_blank">this</a> thread and round the corners of the E.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Yeah, this isn&#39;t Mitsubishi but, if I can&#39;t
    find the real one, I will use this one and tweak it a little bit with round corners
    and a few othe things. <BR> <BR>Still hoping for the perfect match <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    BORDER=0> <BR>Thanks for your comment. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, this one doesn&#39;t
    even come close to Bitsumishi. The I, R and other letters are too different. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks anyway <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
