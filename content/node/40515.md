body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\nI'm looking for a rather simple font, or something similar.
  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/samograffiti_3498.jpg]\r\nIt's the all caps
  font used by Jean-Michel Basquiat for his graffiti art, and in some of his paintings.
  I'm guessing an exact replica doesn't exist so I'll settle for one similar, that
  hasn't the distinctive E for example. Hoping that some of you can help me out here.
  \r\n\r\nthanks in advance\r\n\r\nGeert"
