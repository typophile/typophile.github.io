  you,\r\nand it goes like this:\r\nill post some sounds files of words in hebrew\r\nand
  the idea is to get from ppl here,some sort of\r\ngraphic/typographic visuals relate
  to the sounds\r\nwithout knowing its meaning.\r\nthe next step is to post the same
  words written in hebrew\r\nagain without the meaning,and to get again visual translation\r\nwhich
  can be anything,from images to forms or to something u pick up from the street.\r\n\r\ni
  would like also to know if you think the order should be first\r\nthe written words
  and the the sounds,and if the words should be serif or sanserif\r\njust pop up an
  idea to split it,on other forum ill post the oppsite from here.\r\n\r\nthank you,ill
  post it soon "
