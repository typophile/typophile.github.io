body: "I've done okay for the last few years using inches for the page and points
  for type, meaning I can make pretty decent looking pages, but I definitely labour
  over the beauty. I've recently realized that If I knew how to properly think and
  build in points and picas, the beauty would be considerably less laboured. I learned
  it in one course, but we all thought 'yeah this is archaic' and didn't pay a whole
  lot of attention. \r\n\r\nSo, now that I want to go from decent to amazing, can
  anyone recommend a good explanation of how and why points and picas work so well?
  This could be a book or online article. Then, I would really like to work through
  a series of exercises that will get me up to speed on building pages and setting
  type. \r\n\r\nSuggestions?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nJennifer"

    easier to use when I need a finer grid. Who wants to work with .7854 of an inch
    grid? ;^)\r\n\r\nIt is always easy to go back to inches if you need to because
    12 picas make an inch, or 72 points make an inch. "

    points to the inch, just to mess things up. \r\n\r\nToday, just think of a pica
    as a sixth of an inch and you will be fine."

  body: "You're lucky you're in north america.\r\n\r\nThe silly US system for measuring
    pages in inches will be handy if you're planning on using a point/pica grid because
    these measurements are compatible.\r\n\r\nan inch is made up of 6 picas.\r\n\r\neach
    pica is made up of 12 points.\r\n\r\neach inch then contains 72 points.\r\n\r\nNow,
    using points to measure the size of type goes back to when they used to have metal
    type for printing.\r\n\r\nThe total maximum size of the font (maybe used in a
    capital M or something) was the entire height of the size.  a 12-point 'e' won't
    be 1/6 of an inch in height, because a lowercase 'e' doesn't take up the full
    height it could within the character set.\r\n\r\nI am stuck here in Canada, and
    we're 100% metric, save our paper sizes thanks to america.  I really really wish
    we could just have metric paper sizes, they make so much more sense.\r\n\r\nOh
    well, I guess I'll have to live in a world of measurements *not* based on a base-10
    decimal system."

  body: "Jennifer, I think that the best is you start to visualize the measurement.
    You can build a ruler in quark or other app. of your choice. Just change the preferences
    to the measurement you want (i.e. picas or points) and, by duplicating lines you
    can make your ruller. 1 pica is 12 points. Make a 12 point square divided in 12
    parts, then duplicate it (by the number, don't drag) until it reaches the size
    you want. Do you follow me? You can include lines thicker or thinner in it as
    seen in a typical rulers. When you have the artwork done, output to positive film,
    the result is a transparent ruler. You ruler.\r\nI once confronted myself with
    this problem, but in my case I need to understand visually what is a inch. Now
    I know: 72 pts.\r\n\r\nAfter you are done you can call it \"The Jennifer Typometer\"\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
