  body: Looks like a <a href="http://www.lineto.com/" target="_blank">Lineto</a> typeface,
    but I checked out all the fonts on their site and didn't find an exact match;
    Autoscape is pretty close, though.

  body: Arrgh -- it's so close to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dimitrelima/0arame/">Arame</a>
    I can taste it, but it's not exact!
