  also made an alternate a, w and g.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

  body: "All of the \"I am a typography newbie\" disclaimers apply, but I think this
    is just awesome. It's sleek and clean but it also has its own character. I especially
    love the subtle stroke thinning where curves join stems, as in /r/n/h/p/ etc.
    The only thing that makes me feel a little iffy is the question mark; maybe a
    gradual contour instead of an abrupt bend would be nice?\r\n\r\nConcerning the
    alternates, more options are good, but I find the two-storey /a/ much more attractive.
    I find the one-storey /ae/ to be a little problematic too. That said, I much prefer
    the one-storey /g/ over the two-storey.\r\n\r\nConcerning the name, I can't say
    it invokes memories of said decade (as it was before I was born), but it still
    doesn't quite do it for me...\r\n\r\nAnyway, great work! Can we expect to see
    multiple weights/italics in the future?"

  body: "Thanks for the comments-\r\n\r\nIndeed that name was just a working title.
    I've already changed into Spurless. And this is still work in progress: those
    alternate characters are just studies at the moment, and question mark is also
    not finished yet.\r\n\r\nAnd yes; this will have multiple weights with italics/obliques."
