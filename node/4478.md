body: "Hello, <BR> <BR>   I was wondering if any of you out there can give a few sugestions
  on how to improve on this design. We have to use the word &#34;Composition&#34;
  and give the definition. The definition can be in any font, but the word &#34;Composition&#34;
  has to be in either Helvetica Black or Arial Black. <BR> <BR>This is due on wednesday
  and my professor ran out of time toady to give me any kind of solid feedback. Given
  his &#34;No artwork emails&#34; policy I am feeling frustrated about a good direction
  to move in. The only critique that he managed to offer was that &#34;the word &#39;Composition&#39;
  and the definition are crammed into the space there. And to explore more use of
  the unlimited typfaces avaliable for the definition. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the link
  and I appreciate any helpful tips or direction to explore!  <BR> <BR>\tThank you,

    to me that the lines of text are being swallowed

  body: To me, your definition is competing with the large overlapping Cs. Because
    they &#40;the big Cs&#41; create a wonderful, lively shape that dominates the
    format, perhaps your definition could be something more subdued and orderly for
    more contrast. You&#39;ve got big to small, now maybe try chaos to order &#40;but
    always allow one to dominate&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think I would lose the gray and
    work only with black and white. Only reintroduce the gray if you really need it.
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s very nice overall. You&#39;re a much better student than I was...

  body: 'Thanks to all for your input. I got some good ideas and interesting directions
    to look at. <BR> <BR>@Darrell: The kind of teacher that tells us his experience
    of design school consisted of staying up all night to make a design &#34;perfect&#34;
    simply to avoid the wrath of his Prof. And on other days, to have the same prof
    snatch student work off the board during crtiques and expediently shred it before
    all to see, saving the world from yet another horrificly designed catastrophe.
    It&#39;s pay back time I guess &#62;<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: do you by chance go to university of cincinnati - my wife and i endured many
    a public hangings there during design critiques.  <BR> <BR>as far as the fonts
    go good luck - i think you have a great design. if you&#39;re feeling devilish
    then you may want to do the definition in a bold script to really blow his mind.
