body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Digraph</strong>\r\n\r\nA 'digraph'
  is the use of two letters to represent a single phoneme or a sequence of phonemes
  that does not correspond to the letters which compose the digraph. In some languages
  digraphs are considered individual letters for alphabetizing, casing, &c. In other
  languages, such as English, this is not the case. Some digraphs have their own code
  points in [[Unicode]], and as thus it is important to understand which digraphs
  can be decomposed and which cannot.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/29782\">Not
