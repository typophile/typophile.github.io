  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am in the middle of creating a new website for a client, and in the process I am also looking to update their logo, as it is currently looking very outdated. The current logo is in [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/galapagos/maiandra/gd/|Maiandra GD]], not the best looking font I&rsquo;ve ever seen for a children&rsquo;s website, especially with every letter being in a different colour. However, the client seems to be very keen on it, despite my gently hinting that their current logo looks abhorrent (though not in so many words). I would therefore like to update the logo only subtly, using a similar but more modern font.</p>
<p>The website sells pushchairs and prams, so it would need to be something child-friendly, and preferably have the same chunky feel as Maiandra. As already mentioned, it should have a more modern feel to it, yet not be too different at the same time.</p>
<p>All suggestions would be sincerely appreciated!
Thank you</p>

<p>I would be cautious about offering revised logos unless the person in charge of the company agrees in advance. I have seen several clients go ballistic when revised logos are presented after they&rsquo;ve said they were happy with the current one. They may think that you aren&rsquo;t paying attention to their wishes, and it may offend a client who likes their current logo (bad as it may be).</p>
<p>On one memorable occasion when I was working at a large design firm, the CEO of a large company looked at our concepts and literally yelled &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t [F word] with our logo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now maybe your client will like your new logo ideas, but size up your client first.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">[[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Fritz/|Fritz]] by Christian Schwartz is based on Oz Cooper lettering, as is Maiandra. I like it a lot, especially the chunky weights, and think it would be lovely for children&rsquo;s stuff. Also based on the same bit of lettering, apparently, as Fritz is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/galapagos/robusto/|Robusto]]. My favorite of the three is Fritz.</div>
