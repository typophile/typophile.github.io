    done with software.\r\n\r\nIt would be something quite different if the cell phone

    then one in Helvetica, then in Comic Sans -- but it would still <em>all</em> be
    A's.\r\n\r\n (Still struggling to understand the difference between a character

    new shape to the same code point.</cite>\r\n\r\nAgreed ... apart from the 'let's
    replace a random glyph with a totally new shape', that is. There is a historical
    reason the glyph K has the form it has, going back to (approx.) the 7th century
    B.C.\r\n\r\n<cite>Could this method be expanded to other non-caps keys ('non-priority'
    ones) also by allowing other letter styles besides only lower and upper cases
    of the caps key?</cite>\r\n\r\nSure. Historically, the Caps key is <em>only</em>
    used to toggle between capital and lowercase, and thus behaves slightly different
    than, for example, the Shift key. But,  for example, the Alt key (Opt on a Mac)
    serves another purpose -- accessing character codes that cannot be entered on
    a regular keyboard. It's also possible not to get 'a character' at all when pressing
    one or more keys, but instead perform a system command (whatever Ctrl+Alt+Del
    did, it did *not* send an ASCII code).\r\n\r\nAssigning character codes to any
    key, or key combo, or key sequence, can all be done in software. It's the basis
    for custom keyboard mappings such as, oh, AZERTY -- French, QWERTZ -- German,
    and Dvorak. These are examples of (basically) moving the standard ASCII keys around,
    most allow access to a few additional characters (\xDF, \xE4), and some have additional
    software support to easily create accented characters.\r\nThere is no reason to
    stick to ASCII keys either -- Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew and InScript keyboards
    send totally different codes.\r\n\r\nThe caveat here is the connected computer
    (actually, its Operating System) must be set up to expect 'other' keycodes --
    it's no use sending a command '\u092B\u093C\u094B\u0932\u094D\u0921\u0930 \u092C\u0928\u093E\u0928\u093E'
    to a Western computer, and in reverse, typing 'mkdir' may simply not be possible
    with 'another keyboard'.\r\n\r\nThe command 'mkdir' <em>will not be understood</em>
    if it is 'spelled' 'm\u0915dir' -- where <em>spelling</em> means, for this discussion,
    the actual character codes sent in sequence to the computer -- U+6D, U+915, U+64,
    U+69, U+72. To be properly recognized, the codes should be U+6D, U+6B, U+64, U+69,
    U+72\r\nHowever, this is totally <em>independent</em> how these codes are represented
    <em>on your screen</em>. If you hack your fonts to see \"\u30A8\u2764\u306E\u2655\u82A0\"
    instead, nobody will care."

  body: Flipping through alternates makes sense when you're dealing with a font that
    has a lot of alternates. Sometimes alternates don't fit neatly into categories
    like historical alternates, swash etc. Tap the space bar and bang bang bang until
    you see one you like. Is that along the lines of what we're talking about?
