body: "Hi, i'm looking for typefaces for a television interface. Legibility is of
  course important but it's almost as important that it's a space saver for use in
  EPG:s (the table with different programmes in your digital tv interface).\r\n\r\nI
  have two so far that looks interesting and wanted to check if anyone out there has
  experience from something similar or just know faces that are optimized for (tv)screen-use.\r\n\r\nThe
  one i'm the most interested in at the moment is Clearview that have some condensed
  styles.\r\nhttp://www.terminaldesign.com/fonts/sets/?CID=4\r\n\r\nMonotype Screen
  looks ok as well but no condensed styles\r\nhttp://www.monotypefoundation.org/ProductsServices/tv_fonts.aspx\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "I appreciate my esteemed colleague\u2019s plug for my site, but TV-interface
    fonts have to be hacked and dug out so much to be legible on NTSC it\u2019s not
    funny. I don\u2019t know of any off-the-shelf fonts that work well in those conditions,
    unless the fonts are huge, but that\u2019s a different story. (So is HDTV.) Chyron
    etc. fonts are custom-mangled so they look vaguely legible onscreen.\r\n\r\nCan
    you tell us more about your application?\r\n\r\n\u2014  \r\nJoe Clark\r\nhttp://joeclark.org/"

    a ton of cash I\u2019d suggest going custom and working with a good local type
    designer who can readily get access to a test rig.  I was involved in an NTSC
    TV font project (practically no budget) a few years ago, and there was a lot of
    test and tweak, retest and tweak, rinse, repeat \u2013 having a designer available
    for site visits was invaluable. Basically we started by trying different weights
    of our fonts until we found the ones that performed best, then adjusted the spacing,
    character shapes and counter shapes until we got the best results. Finally applied
    some hints to edge out some artifacts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
