body: Here is something that I&#39;ve not come across before that took me by suprise.
  I wonder if anyone has any knowledge on this effect, or if its just my eyes failing
  &#40;not good for a designer!&#41;. <BR> <BR>I was visiting my favourite bike manufacturer&#39;s
  website &#40;using a windows pc, pah&#41; and decided to register my Brompton. On
  the registration page there is black type on a yellow striped background. Along
  the top and bottom regions of the font, its horizontal lines occasionally appear
  to be a dark blue colour, though they are not. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.bromptonbicycle.co.uk/index.cfm?fuseaction=register.owner"

  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve never seen this before. Is my career over or is this an effect
  others have seen elsewhere???

  body: 'David, I see an illusion too, but not exactly what you describe: I see more
    grayness and purple. It probably depends a lot on your particular LCD too. <BR>
    <BR>I think this has to do with the way the black is breaking up and grouping
    the white or the yellow. Like I also see extra-saturated patches of yellow within
    some letters. <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s called irradiation, but I&#39;m not sure.

  body: I&#39;ve had mine for nearly two years - they&#39;re fantastic and beautifully
    made - and not in some asian sweatshop either but right here in London. <BR> <BR>They
    handle differently! They&#39;re far more nimble and agile than a mountain bike,
    and they&#39;re great in the city - they&#39;re particularly good at accellerating
    &#40;due to the small wheels&#41;, but beware of wet metal manhole covers while
    turning. <BR> <BR>Get a 3 speed T model. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    C3 is beautifull, but the grown-up in me has convinced me i don&#39;t live in
    a &#39;fair weather area&#39;. <BR> <BR>Another excuse to go to London...

    priced bike costs more than a trip to London &#43; UK prices bike.  <BR> <BR>And
    it would be a good excuse to go to London.

    that I liked the stripped down look of the C model... <BR> <BR>Well, since I&#39;ve
    already derailed this thread completely; David, are you working on any new books?
    And what&#39;s with a vegan choosing a username like Porky?

    &#39;new&#39; colours on the commodore 64 by drawing lines of different colours,
    but with a similar tone, next to each other. To detect colours of equal strengh
    you usually turned the colour set on your tv to black and white, and the colours
    with the same grey tone matched... No need for that now, eh. <BR> <BR><b>Regarding
    bikes</b>, and this is a question directed to Kenn: Those bikes you only find
    in Denmark, pretty weird looking, with the saddle on a strap. What are they called?
    I was thinking about trying to order one, but I can&#39;t find them on the net.
    Plain to see, I can hardly describe them. <BR>Ken?  <BR> <BR>'
