  two typefaces. Just thought I would check here in case someone has seen these before.\r\n\r\nThis
  first sample is from a book titled Fransche Kunst, printed 1918\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/option01-a-c1_6227.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/option01-a-c2_5598.jpg]\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  second typeface is from the book Mensch en Natuur, 1913.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/option02-a-c1_4989.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/option02-a-c2_5246.jpg]"
