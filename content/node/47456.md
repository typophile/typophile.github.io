body: "First time on logo design part of the forum, hello to the regulars and all.\r\n\r\nBelow
  are first sketches of the logo for a company which operates on numerous grounds:
  publishing, conferences, training courses, learning courses, e-learning, on the
  subject of management. \r\n\r\nCompany operates for about 5 years on the local market
  and its name and BI were changed several times, thought products they sell remain
  constant and have high reputation and are well recognized among aimed target group.\r\n\r\nThis
  time they need another name change and drop some associations. (see img of <strong>current</strong>
  logo, NOT a subject to critique!)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMI_6584.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  name will be <strong>ICAN</strong> and is ment to be meaningless noun. Dropped Canadian
  associations from previous BI.\r\n\r\nICAN must not have any associations with:
  <strong>iSomething</strong> bandwagon, <strong>I can</strong> mistakes, broken word
  <strong>...can...</strong> (Ameri<strong>can</strong>, <strong>can</strong>on, etc.)
  Knowledge of english is common among target audience.\r\n\r\nLogo must be accompanied
  by taglines specifying the branch of the product (eg. publishing, education, institute,
  etc.) Variety of repro targets: offset up to billboards size, desktop, fax, screen,
  engravings. Extreme small repros without tagline.\r\n\r\nAnd here are said proposals:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ican_5554.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnyone
  willing to share thoughts on the sketches is most welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAntoni

    common to all of them? \r\n\r\nWhat I see now misses a soul, a feel.\r\nSure it
    is a nice picture perhaps, but logo (lets say: identity) design should be more
    than that.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of a company is it? A happy one where the people wear
    jeans and shirts? Or a rigid business with suits? Or something in between? What
    are their products? For whom are they for? How does it communicates with their
    customers now? (in that you can often see what kind they WANT to be, but the question
    should be: who are they really)\r\nFind out who they realy are and what their
    mission and vision for the future is. \r\n\r\nI would like to see some actual
    pencil sketches. Do you have them?\r\n\r\nBased on these two pictures I would
    explore the second one. The ornamental style may fit the company better.\r\n\r\nThe
    name ICAN is not a meaningless noun. In a world full of iPods, iStockphoto etc.
    it has a meaning and some association with all of them.\r\n\r\nI like your choice
    of dropping things like dropshadows, gradients etc. since they can make it harder
    to use the logo on so many media.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\nRaymond"

  body: "Hi Raymond, thanks for your replay.\r\n\r\n\"The company does so many things.
    Are there things that are common to all of them?\"\r\n\r\nThe only common thing
    is a subject of management, leadership, etc. The publications, conferences, trainings
    all are about it. A character of business is formal and strict \u2013 corporate
    look, feel and behave. Communication channels are printed media (brochures, magazine
    ads) and internet.\r\nBut the company lacks its identity \u2013 it sells known
    products with its logos (Harvard Business Review, Harvard Business School Publishing)
    and there's no real local competitors in this area (Poland). \r\n\r\n\"Find out
    who they realy are and what their mission and vision for the future is\"\r\nAs
    I can see, there's no coherent vision of the future, corporate culture or aspirations,
    apart from pragmatic running business. The company grows very fast and is charging
    lots of money for its services. Clients are mostly top dogs with no much choice
    between various products from competitors. It seems CEOs and VPs got no time and
    urgent need to seek for ICAN's identity. The main and only reason for the design
    project is a company name change and dropping Canadian symbols. All I have written
    are my assumptions, I haven't even got any real brief for this work. It seems
    no one cares:)\r\n\r\nOh, and I got some \"on paper\" sketches, but alas I don't
    have running scanner for a while, besides they won't help much I'm sure.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAntoni

    which comes to mind: do you think your designs reflect this properly?\r\n\r\n\"A
    character of business is formal and strict \u2013 corporate look, feel and behave.\"\r\nSame
    here. Do you think your designs reflect this?\r\n\r\nIf your answer to both is
    yes, you have something that suits. We all have our own styles. We all come with
    another sollution to this question. All good.\r\n\r\n\"But the company lacks its
    identity.\" \r\nI see an opportunity here. :-)\r\nYou have the power of adding
    something. Adding in the sense of something you might spot in all of the things
    you have seen, heard, read and felt.\r\n\r\nNo vision and mission? Maybe on their
    site? If you read a few text of them concerning their business some of this might
    come to light.\r\n\r\nA little critique though: I'm not sure if your logo's are
    that different in comparison to others.\r\nWith version 2 it looks refreshing,
    but in the lowest version the typographic ornaments become a bit of wings. Somewhat
    dated. I don't feel this with the bigger version that much.\r\n\r\nWhat is the
    reason for the dot behing PUBLISHING, EDUCATION? A part of an exclamation mark!
    If so, it brings meaning to ican which wasn't what was supposed to happen.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps too!\r\n\r\nRaymond"

    increasing kerning?\r\n\r\nAbout the \"i\":\r\n- The extra detail to the \"i\"s
    bottom is either not polished or overkill. The crown is not legible in the small
    size sample. Maybe using a more traditional chess king's figure as a guide can
    help as in the below image? I'm a chess player and the cross alone tells me it's
    the king immediately. Beside, the cross should be legible in small sizes. Holding
    the \"i\" and the cross shaped crown together, not letting there be a space between
    them should help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AAAAAo_Rq5kAAAAAAJETZQ_6395.jpg]"

  body: "While your mark is improving, I think the name's still very problematic.
    I immediately thought of ICANN as well, but most people won't. A bigger problem
    is that there are numerous Canadian businesses already using this name, such as:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.icanhelps.com|ICAN]]
    - an international charity based in Toronto\r\n[[http://www.ican.nf.net|ICAN]]
    - a marine tech company based in the Maratimes\r\n[[http://www.icangroup.ca|ICAN]]
    - Canadian auction network\r\n[[http://www.ican.nfld.net|ICAN]] - Institute of
    Chartered Accountants of Newfoundland\r\n\r\n...all this from the first 10 results
    on Google. Your client might have difficulty getting a trademark for the name.\r\n\r\nIf
    ICAN is \"meaningless\", and almost certain to be confused for an acronym by anyone
    (when it's not), why use it? You may have already argued this matter with the
    client, but it seems that the business would benefit greatly from a name that's
    both distinctive and prestigious (which would match the direction you seem to
    be headed graphically)."

    it sells to itself. Disadvantages of the chosen name were clear to me from the

    than I've thought of. It's one of the best features of forums like typophile.
    Thanks. However, I'm quite sure the client won't change his mind, he seems stubburn
    about the name for some reason. I'll show him what I and you found about \"the
    other icans\".\r\n\r\nBoke, the chess king figure is not polished yet. It needs
    more work than I initially thought. If I take on the concept, it'll need to be:
    <ul><li>instantly recognizable as a letter i, <li>instatly recognizable as a king
    chess figure, <li>last but not least, it cannot evoke any feudal or catholic associations
    <em>a cross</em> and <em>a king</em> have in my part of Europe.</ul>\r\n\r\nMy
