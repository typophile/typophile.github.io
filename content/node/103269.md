  body: Quite impressive. My only gripe is with the lowercase /k/, which is historically
    accurate but rather confusing to someone not familiar with this particular rendering
    of the letter. The font might be more useful to a wider number of potential buyers
    if there were an alternate /k/ character, structured somewhat along the lines
    of the /sz/ ligature...IMHO. Otherwise, great stuff.

  body: "Thanks, Nick.\r\nThe font includes an alternate /k/ with corresponding ligatures
    as a stylistic alternate. It can be seen (somewhat hidden) in the fourth line,
    second word, of the third sample image above. Here's a bigger picture:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WKS10_5709.png]\r\nI
    don't know whether I got it right or not (I think I did), but I sure didn't like
    the modern /k/ in Adobe/Linotype's Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch, with its diagonal
    leg disrupting the darkness and vertical patterning of the lowercase \"textura\".\r\n\r\nBest
    wishes.\r\n\r\n"

    job.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether it's helpful to the cause of blackletter in this
    age if you quote Koch's <em>haarstr\xE4ubende</em> quotation in the marketing
    materials, though.  :P\r\n\r\nIs that epic drop-cap {I} also part of the font...?"

    piece of interwoven characters. But, as you suggest, it might be wise to replace
    it with some other more neutral piece of text. And yes, the drop cap /I/ is part
    of the font.\r\n\r\nAll the best.\r\n"

  body: "I agree about the Koch quote, it really makes a bad case for Fraktur. Very
    nice typeface though.\r\n\r\nBut I am curious to know: I like this a lot but could
    not find any modern application for it beyond perhaps a beer label. Do people
    use it to render historical texts accurately, so in that sense is it a purely
    historical reconstruction, or have you seen possible examples of modern usage?"

    The Hebrew cut in Kaas does more to help blackletter than almost anything else.
    We need that for Eskapade. http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/eskapade/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    (it seems it can't be removed from the first post, though ...). For modern uses
    of blackletter in general, you might have a look, for example, at \"[[http://slanted.de/shop/slanted-magazin-10-heavy-metal-lovers|Slanted
    Magazin #10 \u2013 Heavy Metal. Lovers]].\" As a nice aside, I was gladly surprised
    a few months ago when I saw a [[http://www.saxon747.com/en/index.php/band/releases/260|recent
    release]] by rock veterans Saxon which made use of a somewhat popular version
    of Wilhelm Klingspor Schrift for some of the text. No hard rules, however: use
    blackletter at your discretion and see whether it fits your purpose. And finally,
    I would really like to include Yiddish in the font, but that is well beyond my
    (limited) knowledege of different languages.\r\n\r\nThanks again."
