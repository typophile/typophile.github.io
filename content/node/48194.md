body: Is it possible to take a script font and put it on a curved baseline? Or is
  that done with hand-lettering only?

    and got varying results.\r\n\r\ndid you have a specific script in mind?\r\n\r\nhere's

    the curve doesn\u2019t overwhelm the type, ie. small type on large circle."

  body: I don't have a script in mind, I was just wondering if any happened to be
    particularly suited to the task. I'm imagining connectors (is there a better name
    for that bit of font anatomy?) jutting all about and not doing much connecting.

  body: "some fonts, such as Bickham Script, doesn't work well because it has delicate
    pothooks that connect on both right and left side of a glyph.\r\n\r\nRadio, from
    Magnus Rakeng, has a thicker, right-side-only pothook that joins at the stem.\r\n\r\nSo
    Radio seems to work fairly well. (www.vllg.com)\r\n\r\nIt can never hurt to try
    some lettering \u2014 gives you the advantage of customizing each particular letter
    combination.\r\n\r\nbest of luck."
