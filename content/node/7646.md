body: Is there a digital version of Metro available with the two-storey &#39;a&#39;?
  <BR> <BR>I have a few printed samples of the face &#40;One in  a 1962 HMSO Handbook
  called <i>The Design of Forms in Government Departments</i> and one in <i>20th Century
  Type Designers</i>&#41; which both show a two-storey &#39;a&#39;. The only digital
  version I can find is Linotype&#39;s, which has the single-storey &#39;a&#39;, and
  I can&#39;t find any sign of an alternative character. <BR> <BR> <BR>A quick search
  turned up this thread <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=next&amp;topic=83&amp;page=12656"
  target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=next&amp;topic=83&amp;page=12656</a>
  but the consensus there appears to view the two-storey &#39;a&#39; as the alternative,
  rather than the standard. <BR> <BR>Any ideas?

  body: Steve this is something I really do wish someone&#42; would fix. There are
    alternates not taken advantage of neither by  Linotype &#40;Metro&#41; nor Bitstream
    &#40;Geometric 415&#41; ... or rather I mean that both companies chose to digitize
    the alternate g and a ... gave us the least interesting W ... nor the proper ampersand
    <BR> <BR>&#42;Dan can&#39;t you do something about this. =^D

    like this. So one could purchase Linotype&#39;s Metro &#40;or G 415&#41; and then

  body: 'Unless you re-use actual outline data, there can be no legal obstacle to
    making new glyphs. Ethically, many people will tell you the &#34;Design&#34; belongs
    to the original creator. Some even extend this to cover non-Latin scripts! To
    me this holds no water, because abstract things belong to society more than individuals
    &#40;nothing is created in a vacuum&#41;, and the more people end up working on
    something needed, the more <i>users</i> benefit. <BR> <BR>What I would do however
    is contact the makers of the original, and tell them of your plans; give them
    an opportunity to help, or convince you not to do it. But you decide in the end.
    Also: give proper credit for the original of course - although I guess in this
    case you&#39;d <i>have</i> to do that to make the result useful! <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Both Linotype&#39;s &amp; Bitstream&#39;s EULAs allow for modifications only
    with written consent. But, I&#39;d be willing to bet that adding these characters
    would be only seen as a good thing. Are you only going to add the a and g, or
    are you going to do the entire typeface proper justice?

  body: Hrant, creating new glyphs and adding them into the Metro font file is a modification.
    Making new glyphs and putting them in a separate font, which isn&#39;t called
    Metro but which you use along side of Metro is NOT a modification! <BR> <BR>Can
    InDesign pull alternates from a different font? I&#39;m thinking no, right? Could
    you do some sort of search and replace? <BR> <BR>Tiffany, I&#39;ll ask about getting
    those alternate glyphs into Metro tomorrow, but it would probably take a while,
    even if they do opt to do it. Keep on me about it, and I&#39;ll keep on it!

    do anything - I&#39;m no type designer. I just thought that if the consensus was
    that ths kind of thing would be ethical, legal and practical, someone who <i>is</i>
    a type designer might be tempted by the prospect of an interesting and small set
    of glyphs. Either out of interest or as a commercial project with a potentially
    reasonable return. &#40;There&#39;s one customer here, and it sounds like there
    might be some more if the interest in Dwiggins&#39; work is anything to go by&#41;.
    This would be much less work than a full character set, and might provide a useful
    project for an independent designer. <BR>&#40;I wouldn&#39;t rule mself out of
    considering some kind of financial support or partnership for such a project,
    though&#41;. <BR> <BR>I would really like to see someone do justice to the face
    as a whole, but maybe that&#39;s too much to ask - adding the more interesting
    glyphs to the existing faces seems a more likely prospect. <BR> <BR>BTW, I would
    agree with Hrant - I don&#39;t think this would be seen as <i>modification</i>'

    you&#39;re reply when I posted mine. <BR> <BR>I agree that the second option -
    a separate font file would not be modification. That was what I had in mind. <BR>Can
    InDesign not automate that. Maybe with some scripting...?

  body: Steve, if you view my last post, you&#39;ll see that it isn&#39;t a modification
    if you do it right ;-&#41;. Anytime you open up an existing font and do anything
    to it, you ARE modifying it. But making a new font, comprised entirely of new
    glyphs which could be used together with an old font isn&#39;t modifying anything,
    because you aren&#39;t touching the original font data. Thanks for bringing this
    up though! Metro is a great face.

  body: The Japanese version of InDesign has a composite font feature that can enable
    exactly this sort of thing. Some set of default glyphs in one font are replaced
    by glyphs from another font. I don&#39;t think it enables you to do them as alternates.
    <BR> <BR>You could also use SING glyphlets to achieve the same thing, including
    your choice of having them as alternates or as default glyphs. SING is a newish
    Adobe technology for having standalone glyphs that add on to existing fonts. Again,
    it was developed primarily for the Japanese market. Currently it&#39;s available
    as a public beta for InDesign CS, but it would be reasonable to expect greater
    integration in the future. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: The ghetto way of doing it would be to search and replace all &#39;a&#39;s
    and &#39;g&#39;s of Metro with the new glyphs in another font. It&#39;s certainly
    easy enough to accomplish this in InDesign. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s what I would probably
    do if adding glyphs to the font itself were impossible. Of course, it also depends
    on just how much you&#39;re using Metro. I have trouble trusting search and replace
    on large projects. <BR> <BR>Check, recheck, and check again.

    haven&#39;t generated feature-rich OT versions of their best-selling fonts.  <BR>
    <BR>can you imagine gill OT with the old style figs on board, or joanna with small
    caps. what about a whopping version of times, with SCOSF &amp; multi-lingual support...&amp;
    avant guarde with a full set of alts/ligs/logotypes....

    me, Geraint, this is something that we ARE working on. These things take a lot
    of time though; at the same time that we want to ree-release old favorites, we
    also want to keep bringing new fonts to the market &#40;plus all old AND new fonts
    need to get up to speed on supporting broader character sets, meaning exponentially
    more glyphs and potential bugs&#41;. I mean, the great old type designers aren&#39;t
    going to live forever

    we won&#39;t be able to release an OpenType version of Metro anytime soon, unless
    someone were to commission the change directly. I have e-mailed Tiffany and Steve
    about the details that such a commission would require. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know
    what Bitstream&#39;s procedure is for handling these sorts of things, or how they
    choose which fonts to re-issure in OpenType updates. <BR> <BR>If anyone has further
    questions about Linotype&#39;s OpenType re-issues, Metro, or custom design work,
    I&#39;d be happy to answer your questions personally offline. Feel free to contact
    me via my Typophile user profile.
