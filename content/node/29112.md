  body: "If you are thinking of a font where the Latin letters mimic the Thai script,
    <a href=\"http://www.weygandt.de/aw_siam.htm\">AW Siam</a> by Andreas Weygandt
    is a Thai-look-alike free font I ran across by accident once. I saw a fair number
    of faux-Thai signs in English when I lived in Thailand, and I tend to consider
    them a bit kitsch, but I guess this is the most obvious solution for evoking a
    culture that doesn't use the Roman alphabet for its native language.\r\n\r\nAn
    alternative would be to take the approach of the \"Amazing Thailand\" logo used
    a while back. The lettering evoked the shapes occuring in Thai crafts and architecture,
    I think. The uppercase T for example mimicked the distinctive curves of Thai eaves.
    I can't seem to find it anywhere, but you can see a Cyrillic version of what I'm
    talking about <a href=\"http://www.tourismthailand.ru/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nI suggest
    you take a look at these approaches and come up with your own, more subtle solutions.
    I would like to see what you come up with, if possible. Good luck!"
