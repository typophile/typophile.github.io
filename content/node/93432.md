body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am designing a family of 5 weights. When I name the fonts they
  appears in a submenu in my menu fonts, in my application but not the way I want.
  I wish Light + Light italic were on the top of the menu and Bold + Bolditalic at
  the bottom. I guess I am doing something wrong in the font naming in Fontlab but
  I am stucked here and cannot find a way to resolve that. Any help would be welcome

    Getting anal over a petty annoyance ain\u2019t worth the effort.\r\n\r\nOn the
    other hand, if you numbered the weights between light and bold, they might sort
    according to your demanding specifications\u2026"

  body: "Inspect the \"Panose Weight\" property for each of your fonts. They need
    to be the same for \"Light\" and \"LightItalic\", \"Bold\" and \"BoldItalic\",
    and so on, and increase in value from lightest to heaviest.\r\n\r\n(Nitpick Mode:
    You might want to call those italics \"Light Italic\", \"Bold Italic\", and so
    on, according to convention. You also might want to re-think \"Light\" and \"SemiLight\";
    the usual order from light to heavy is \"Very Light\", \"Light\", \"Thin\", \"Book\",
    \"Medium\", \"Demi\", \"Bold\", \"Heavy\", \"Black\", \"Extra Black\". Some software
    out there expects this naming convention, rather than counting on the Panose Weight.)"
