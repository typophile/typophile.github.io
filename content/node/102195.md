  tried to find it, via various sites, nothing pop-up... then i thought, probably
  is old and it wasn't renewed and/or remaked.\r\nBut recently i encountered on it
  again, with slight changes, and most important on a new design, which means - it's
  still in use, and it exists. Tryed again with  \"what is this font\" sites, nothing
  again...\r\n\r\nThen i decided that i need your help!\r\nThis is the font."
