  body: "Try stock image sources. Like Stockxpert, iStockPhoto, Jupiterimages etc.\r\nRoyalty-free
    images are available from very low prices actually, and such vendors tend to have
    large selections. Plus you'd be sure to be on the safe side legally (be sure to
    read the licence agreements).\r\nThere are also some free stock sources (of course
    pix are of varying quality there), such as Stockxchange (sxc.hu)."
