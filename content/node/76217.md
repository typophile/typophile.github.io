body: "hi,\r\n\r\ni sent a pdf created from an indesign file with embedded fonts to
  a printer and he sent back a screenshot that shows that text in some fonts were
  completely altered and illegible (see image before/after). as we could not find
  the cause of the problem (thankful for hints), the printer asked me to change the
  texts to vektors. this way we could avoid the letterscramble but some other problems
  occured:\r\n\r\n1. i texts formated with bulletpoints the bulletpoints vanished\r\n2.
  i had created paragraph formats and letter formats using the underline function
  to create a coloured background for emphasised text. the coloured background (i.e.
  the underlining) vanished and left white text on white background...\r\n\r\nas more
  and more printers (especially online printshops) ask to change texts to vectors
  in order to garantee quality - has anybody suggestions on how to change my formats
  in indesign so i won't loose bullets and texts when changing to vectors?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\ngerhard

  body: "Hallo Gerhard,\r\n\r\nYes, this is a strange behaviour of InDesign. Illustrator
    does convert the underlining into a path. You can also just copy the InDesign
    textbox into Illustrator and convert it into paths there and reimport the whole
    thing into InDesign.\r\nAnd the bullet as inherent in the font itself is being
    converted into paths by InDesign either way."

  body: "hallo j\xFCrgen,\r\n\r\nthanks for the tip. this will at least keep me from
    using underlines in indesign as textdecoration in the future.\r\nunfortunately
    the project where the problem came up is a regular magazine of several pages.
    copying every textblock to illustrator to reimport it after the transformation
    is not a very nice prospect. on the other hand i would rather not have to change
    the whole text design concept to get rid of this underlineing issue.\r\n\r\nfor
    the bullets: i used the function \"unordered list\" from the text tool palette
    to creat the bulletpoints. after converting the text to vectors the bullets were
    gone... is there a better way to create a format with bulletpoints? one that will
    keep the points after the change?\r\n\r\nbefore [img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-capture-14_6027.png]after

  body: "I did a quick test (using InDesign CS4) and found that if the bullets were
    made with a style sheet or using the bullet button on the control panel, then
    the bullets do indeed disappear when the type is outlined. Weird.\r\n\r\nHowever
    if the bullets were made manually by typing option-8, they convert to outlines
    just fine. \r\n\r\nSo if you can't find another workaround, you might just make
    each bullet as the option-8 character, then tab over for the indent and insert
    the \"indent to here\" invisible character (command-backslash, or use Type >  Insert
    Special Characters > Other > Indent To Here) so the text aligns at the tab.\r\n\r\nYou
    also might want to assign a character style sheet to the bullets so you can more
    easily modify their appearance.\r\n\r\nTo save time you can just type that series
    of characters once and then copy it to clipboard, and then just paste the 3 characters
    (bullet, tab, and indent-to-here character) as a unit in front of paragraphs that
    need bullets, and that will make it go faster."

  body: "thank you james,\r\nat least this looks like a sensible workaround. although
    that means, that the bullet is not part of the paragraph format and will not be
    easily substituted throughout the whole document lateron. - i will not need this
    for the current project, just thinking ahead...\r\n"

    the list and right-click (also useful if you need to style the bullets differently
    from the text).\r\nI don't remember if it's possible to do it at style level.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Senza

    a character style sheet to the bullets you could later change attributes like
    size and color easily, but I agree that it's certainly not as flexible as the
    method you've used in the past."
