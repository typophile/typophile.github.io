  for one of our clients, and have encountered an odd font issue. I'm hoping that
  someone in this forum can provide some suggestions for a fix.\r\n\r\nI am using
  MetaPlus for my designs. I've noticed that when MetaPlus Medium is placed in powerpoint,
  it is significantly thicker (more bold / black) than the same font when displayed
  in Illustrator or Photoshop. In addition, some of the Roman cuts are displaying
  as italics.\r\n\r\nHas anyone experienced this problem, or more importantly - can
  this be corrected, or is it yet another sad fact of powerpoint!? Thanks.\r\n\r\nBrett"

    is a Microsoft product? Just trying to figure it out! Thanks in advance.
