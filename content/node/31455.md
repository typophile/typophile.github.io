  don't know who takes so much care in creating alternates like those guys (but what

    too, but Birthday was a little curly for the use...maybe.\r\n\r\nThe client does
    actually want \"female\" cursive...\r\n"

    they have a good selection. Hard to print out some of the  foundry's selections,
