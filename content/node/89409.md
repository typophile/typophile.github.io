  I attached a logotype that I like. Does anyone know what font this is?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  are there other fonts that you could recommend for martial arts studio for us in
  the US?\r\n\r\nThanks much[img:sites/default/files/old-images/7302_169175_3675.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks for asking specifics. This is for a video company but the client requests
    a unique ninja symbol and wants to tie in a martial arts style logotype. It is
    Ninjutsu, the Japanese Martial art specifically.\r\n\r\nThe type I am looking
    for is in the wording Kuzushi in above sample not in the slogan type.\r\n\r\nThanks
    kindly,\r\n\r\nChris"
