  are going to London, Edinburgh, Manchester and Leicester at the end of the month
  and I am wondering if any of you might have recommendations for type or design related
  things I could do or see...? My experience from traveling to other places is that
  if you just go by what is in the guide books, then you are missing out on a lot
  of possibly more interesting things.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    \u2013\_a wonderful place. The V&A is great and has lots of artists' books which
    you can arrange an appointment to see. Also, Postman's Park is a lovely spot (just
    google it). The Design Museum is an obvious choice. Check Time Out for current
    exhibitions.\r\n\r\nThis is rather London-centric, I'm afraid...  "

    tours of the City of London. I can highly recommend these.\r\n\r\nTake a look<a

  body: "Thank you all for your suggestions. It is too bad about the Type Museum.
    I had been looking forward to checking it out. Then when I looked at the site
    for hours and ticket prices I found that it would not be open when we are there.\r\n\r\nI
    am definitely going to check out John Voller's tours. I really hope we can do
    that while we are in London.\r\n\r\nThere is so much to do and I feel like we
    have such a limited time. I'll do a little more research on your other recommendations
    and see what we can fit in.\r\n\r\nThank you all very much,\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    nose bleed past Watford.\r\n\r\n1. The John Rylands Library. Recently refurbished
    and now open. Rare books and manuscripts housed in an amazing building.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/\r\n\r\nhttp://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/data1/dg/exhibition/unlock/\r\n\r\n\r\n2.
    Urbis. Usually has some design exhibtions on.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.urbis.org.uk/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.urbis.org.uk/page.asp?id=3134\r\n\r\n3.
    Manchester Art Gallery\r\n\r\nhttp://www.manchestergalleries.org/\r\n\r\n4. Imperial
    War Museum North. Designed by Daniel Libeskind.\r\n\r\nhttp://north.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.00c\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's
    all I can think of for the time being. When is it your thinking of travelling?\r\n\r\nHave
    a great time!\r\n\r\nDave\r\n"
