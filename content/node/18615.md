    in Western newspapers, at least, are the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_(typography)\">dagger</a>
    and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_David\">star of David</a>,
    to indicate, respectively, Christian and Jewish deaths."

  body: cheers ricardo -- as i understand it, the dagger is used when a religious
    figurehead such as a cardinal or a bishop writes to the paper. I find the star
    of david inhabits to many biased connotations to be useful as a general symbol
    of obituaries. All interesting though!
