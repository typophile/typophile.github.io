body: "I'm having some dificulties with FontLab when generating the OT font (using
  FL Studio 5.04 and Windows Vista 64-bits):\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Identical stems are
  rendered/printed differently</strong>\r\n\r\nIn glyph edition, the vertical stem
  is identical to /l/, /i/, /m/ and /n/. But these stems become uneven when shown
  on screen and when printed at small sizes (<9pt). The on screen issue I understand
  is related to font hinting. But the print problem is a mistery.\r\n\r\nI considered
  this may be caused by using recycled toner \u2013 which produces a lighter result
  in my printer. But if this is the issue, stem variation at small sizes must also
  occurs with other fonts, and it's not.\r\n\r\nAny idea? Is thre an optical effect
  in simple vertical forms, like /l/ and /i/, which makes these glyphs appear slighty
  bolder than others, like /f/ and /m/?\r\n\r\nThese are the production screens in
  FontLab:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Problem01_3948.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Problem02_5675.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Problem03_3814.png]\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>2.
  Baseline misaligned on InDesign</strong>\r\n\r\nI'm usign overshoots to round glyphs
  and they works perfectly in FontLab. But in InDesign the text is shows totally misaligned.
  I need to increase ID zoom to 800% to see the text properly.\r\n\r\nThe crazy thing
  is the text prints correctly aligned to baseline. It's a render issue but I cannot
  identify where is the problem.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware the font is still not spaced,
  so the capture bellow and the PDF in annex are very poor:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Problem05_4616.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Problem04_6663.png]\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe
  PDF is somewhat chaotic as the font is in its early development. Anyway, I attach
  it just in case:"

    also affects print, albeit mostly at lower resolutions and/or small sizes. Just
    auto-hint the font for a start.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "What Thomas said. Laser prints (specially at smaller sizes) and watching
    on screen (specially if unhinted) doesn\u2019t reflect the actual font. I suggest
    printing at a bigger size and/or get a high resolution proof from time to time."

    I'll play with it now.\r\n\r\nThe misaligned text in InDesign is also result of
    the lack of hints?"

  body: "Yes, a hinting problem. As you said, if you zoom in, the problem disappears.
    Try to live with that or auotohint to reduce the problem. Note: don\u2019t waste
    many time on hinting at this moment, since it is actually the last stage of type
    design."

  body: Thanks, Cristobal. I'll try to forget this ugly results and trust in the measures
    until the hinting stage comes.
