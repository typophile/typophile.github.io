body: "I've been working casually in a printing company that dates back to 1880 (some
  of their equipment looks almost that old) and am considering working there more
  regularly. But one thing concerns me: air quality. The reek of ink and solvents
  is constantly present and the room where the Macs are, where I would be working,
  has no windows.\r\n\r\nAre there known stats on printers and lung afflictions? Am
  I just being paranoid (or is my ambivalence about this $15/hour job showing itself)
  or is there actually some risk?"

    shop of the general type I've tried out at this month. Both had old, busy presses
    running, both had small Mac departments stuck in dark rooms with no ventilation.
    It's so standard as to be unremarkable.\r\n\r\nI still don't know about the statistical

    some insight into what they're doing health and ecologically - wise that maybe
    other printers aren't but should be implementing for their staff;\r\n\r\n<b><i>\"We
    use an inert water based protective coating sealant on our products which is an
    eco-friendly alternative to polymer based coatings, \"litho seal\" and plastic
    laminates.\r\n\r\nWe run IPA - isopropyl alcohol - free on our printing presses,
    as opposed to the industry average of 8%.\r\n\r\nOur inks are vegetable oil based
    - specifically linseed oil - as opposed to mineral oil.\r\n\r\nThe removal of
    IPA alcohol and use of vegetable ink has virtually eliminated our emissions of
    VOC's - Volatile Organic Compounds - into the atmosphere. These VOC's are a major
    source of ozone pollution and are a potential a health hazard to our staff.\r\n\r\nWe
    promote full colour printing which uses significantly less chemicals, solvents
    and paper in job setup and press cleaning than traditional one or two colour printing.\r\n\r\nWe
    offer quality Digital Print solutions when appropriate to the job.\"</b></i>\r\n\r\nJH\r\n"

    front of a computer monitor all day or putting a cell phone to your head. Smells
    aren't toxic, fumes are. If the print shop takes care to keep its solvents in
    safety cans, that's pretty much it. And that is only to prevent fire. Most solvents
    used today are fairly non-hazardess. And most printers seem to live an awfully
    long time.\r\n\r\nThat green stuff that jazzhustler put up is standard media greenwash.

  body: "From a quick Google search:\r\n\r\n\"<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hc24.html\">Press
    operators and other workers in printing establishments</a> are exposed to airborne
    solvent vapors generated when the press is cleaned. Press-cleaning solutions are
    generally a mixture of chemicals that include various solvents, some of which
    are carcinogens. Adverse health effects from inhalation or skin contact include
    dermatitis, headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, respiratory failure, central
    nervous system depression, coughing, difficult breathing, chest pains, unconsciousness,
    and death. Chronic effects may include kidney and liver damage. Many press operators
    in small print shops have excessive exposures because these shops frequently have
    inadequate ventilation or other controls for the vapors.\"\r\n\r\n\"<a href=\"http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:BjCt_YHy1LEJ:www.orosha.org/pdf/pubs/3119.pdf+printing+industry+health+hazards&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us\">In
    printing and related industries,</a> a variety of chemicals \u2014 including alcohols,
    glues, inks, dyes, cleaners, ammonia, lead, formaldehyde, paper dusts, and many
    types of solvents \u2014 can be found. Employee exposures to chemicals have been
    shown to be higher when associated with press wash-up tasks, use of isopropanol,
    using poor or improper work practices, and inadequate or improper use of ventilation
    systems. Workers should close containers for blanket wash, alcohol, or used shop
    towels. Recirculating pressroom air may save on heating or cooling costs; but
    it also increases concentrations of chemical contaminants in the air that workers
    breathe.\"\r\n"

  body: "I have a small print shop (12'x20') with 2 Vandercooks, and I'm fairly conscious
    of the solvent vapours when I'm cleaning the presses. Generally speaking I take
    the rollers outside and set them on a work-bench I've rigged up to hold them during
    cleaning, and when I'm really on the ball I wear my respirator (I'm not on the
    ball all that often). When I have to clean the rollers & press inside, I leave
    the door open and turn on a ceiling fan, and I'm more conscious of wearing the
    respirator then. I have to admit, though, that this is more to avoid the dizzyness
    & headache I sometimes get without the respirator, rather than concern about long-term
    effects.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, this is only when I'm 2 feet from the solvent and
    it's splashing around and turning to vapour right in front of me. Other than this,
    what I get is the smell of ink and solvent, and, quite frankly, I love that smell.\r\n\r\nBesides,
    I smoke, so this stuff is the least of my problem."

    posted here.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, only each individual can assess her or his health
    needs. If you are at all concerned about the health implications of your employment,
    then all your questions are valid. \r\n\r\nConditions in many printing and design
    shops can indeed be hazardous. Not perhaps to me, not perhaps to bieler. But they
    may be to you, and no one should dissuade you with flippant comments from your
    concerns. Each of us has different tolerances for solvents and air quality. It
    may sound flippant in a different way, but keep in mind that one of our main responsibilities
    is to take care of our own health in this nasty world. Employers won\u2019t, unions
    won\u2019t, government won\u2019t.\r\n\r\nI have worked in a wide variety of printing
    & design shops for 40 years. Some people thrive in toxic conditions. Others succumb
    rapidly to what may seem to be only moderately malignant conditions. There is
    just no way to know what will get to whom when. I hope you can resolve this to
    your satisfaction.\r\n\r\n& given the state of the economy these days, it is just
    irresponsible to say such things as \u201Cwhy work on-site?\u201D or \u201Cwalk,
    and let some other mug get sick.\u201D That set of comments shows a poor understanding
    of the reality of work. Sure, some folks get to work off-site. But that is a dream
    more than a reality in the work world of 2008. & Sure, some folks are willing
    to let others take the fall; that just ain\u2019t a responsible attitude.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck; stay healthy. Keep your eyes open for a better job.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n"
