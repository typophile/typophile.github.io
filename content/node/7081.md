  Thanks for <BR>your input. <BR> <BR>Here is a sample of the original font: <BR>

  body: Karmadrome, buy the font. <BR> <BR>Think about this and you will think the
    font is cheap. To visit MOMA &#40;Metropolitian Museum of Art&#41; here in NYC
    will cost you $20 per person to get into the door. Now if you have a family of
    4 and two are kids you are looking at $80-$90 in entry fees and once you leave
    that it. <BR> <BR>A type licence seems cheap huh

  body: Karmadrome, if you need the font, if you like the font, <i>buy</i>  <BR>the
    font, trust me. Do you really think that someone would  <BR>put all his/her skill,
    effort and dedication into a type design  <BR>and then make it available for <i>free?</i>
    I mean, what do <i>you</i>  <BR>do for a living? Would you be prepared to give
    away your  <BR>wage, your salary, just like that? Or worse, how would you  <BR>feel
    if somebody else gave it away? <BR> <BR>Think about that before you come asking
    for rip-offs again.

    it. But that&#39;s a very rare thing and there&#39;s nothing of this <BR>style
    available. <BR> <BR>Get Conduit. That weight&#39;s only <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&amp;displayfontid=LH.100316.0.5&amp;charSize=14&amp;sampleText=HOCKBRAUSE&amp;sampleSize=60">$21</a>.
