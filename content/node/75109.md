  \ To me, the image looks like someone just put some wordart over a picture.  But,
  to be sure, I was wondering if someone could identify the font.  This way I can
  confirm that it is, in fact, not of the 1862 period but a modern creation.   [[http://www.fsst.org/images/little_crow_wanted_poster.jpg|The
  wanted poster is here.]]  The image is cited as a \"Little Crow Wanted Poster submitted
  by the Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska\".  While I'd hate to question the tribe about
  it, I'm thinking the WANTED text above his head is from a computer.  If someone
  could identify the font and the year it was made (or as close as possible) I'd greatly
  appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the typeface is Engravers MT but you're the experts.
  \ Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n~Dave"

    that the "A" tucks under the "W" tells me this wasn''t achieved with metal or
    wood type. It was also uncommon to see type printed over a photo, as opposed to
    outside the photo area, due to production limitations. The biggest giveaway to
    me is simply that the blurriness of the "WANTED" type doesn''t match that of the
    type on the bottom. '
