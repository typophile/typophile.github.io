		<div class="commentbody">I don't think this thread really belongs in the Build section, which perhaos is why no one has responded to it. It doesn't, so far, touch upon the implications of ClearType rendering for <i>making</i> fonts. <BR> <BR>There is a 'sweet spot' for ClearType rendering which is somewhere around 130dpi. At this resolution, the pixels are small enough for the visible artifacts of the subpixel colour filtering to largely disappear. Below that resolution, e.g. at the old Windows norm of 96dpi the physical pixels are too large for the technology to produce optimal results: the text will still look more faithful to the individual type design, but the fuzz is likely to be noticeable. I used a Toshiba laptop with a native resolution of 133dpi for the past couple of years, and ClearType works very well on this machine. I recently switched to a Dell with a resolution of 146dpi and, of course, ClearType looks even better. I've also seen it in use at 200dpi, and this is really splendid: actually better than quite a lot of what passes for printing these days. <BR> <BR>Note, also, that you can tune the ClearType rendering system on your computer to get the best results for a) your monitor's native gamma and b) your personal colour sensitivity. See <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/1.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/1.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/1.htm</a></a> for more information.

		<div class="commentbody">Dominik, ClearType is really designed as a technology for LCD screens. It works by effectively increasing the x-direction resolution by addressing the individual RGB sub-pixels in an LCD pixel. On a CRT screen, the pixels are not composed of discreet sub-pixels; rather, the colour value of the whole pixel is adjusted to display different colours. <BR> <BR>Interestingly, and for reasons that are not completely understood, many people do find a slight improvement in font rendering using ClearType on a CRT screen, as compared to traditional greyscale antialiasing. The effect is quite minor, and the best guess as to why it seems an improvement is that ClearType is leaking small amounts of colour into adjacent CRT pixels, and this makes curves smoother than with traditional antialiasing. Because CRT is not the target technology for ClearType, little study has been made of its affect on CRT screens.</div>

We rarely read italics type continuously.</i> <BR> <BR>Using italics is useful to show immediate and obvious benefit of ClearType to the rendering of traditionally difficult diagonal strokes. It is pretty obvious that ClearType makes italics more readable, because it maintains the structure of the letters, which is broken in the stepped b/w bitmap, and the notan, which lost in greyscale. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/52666.gif" alt="B/W&#44; greyscale&#44; ClearType"> <BR>So that is a basic improvement in both the aesthetic and functional aspects of one particular kind of type on screen, and it is an obvious improvement easily relatable to the increased x-direction resolution, which has made it useful in showing how ClearType works. <BR> <BR>Personally, I tend not to use italics in my comparisons, because I already <i>know</i> that italics are going to look better and be more readable under ClearType. What is of interest to me is tracking how improvements in the ClearType renderer, increases in screen resolution and, in the case of the CT Font Collection, sensitive design, result in experiential gains in on-screen reading.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What's interesting is that you can do a tradeoff between the &quot;integerness&quot; of weight, and crispness. In an italics, since you have to give up very crisp forms anyway, you actually acquire the ability to deviate from integer weight wihout any [additional] penalty. So I can make my italics slightly lighter or darker pretty easily. However, you're right to imply that a proper relationship with the roman has to be maintained, and making the italics too light would be bad (especially since my angle* is already strong). <BR> <BR>Some related stuff: <BR>- I like to have stroke contrast; and -as I implied above- a 2-pixel stem font isn't necessarily too dark since it can have 1-pixel horizontals; <BR>- I could make the Roman lighter too (if also less crisp); <BR>- Using a lighter weight for emphasis in running text isn't so bad - not as bad as the other way around. <BR>- Crispness can actually be a differentiation technique. It's possible that the best companion to a grayscale Roman is a b&amp;w italic, or&hellip; shudder&hellip; a b&amp;w upright cursive! <BR> <BR>* The angle is actually dictated by the medium to a fair degree, btw. <BR> <BR>Then there's the issue of what weight looks good - and that depends on effective resolution greatly. I think the color in your &quot;best&quot; (3rd row) italic is very good. But maybe a 2-pixel stem weight with looser spacing would be comparable? Anyway, ideal color needs to be worked into the equation with everything else, like chromatism, crispness, etc. <BR> <BR>&gt; there is no grey <BR> <BR>True, but you could say that the three channels in a [properly calibrated] display are defined as producing no color when lighted with equal [numeric] intensity. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

I settled on 11.7 degrees off vertical, which as you say is closer to 1:4, after testing rendering. One of the nice things about the CT Font Collection project is that we were able to test in the specific conditions of the target rendering system.</div>
