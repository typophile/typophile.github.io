  options, containing shapes, etc? Thanks.

  body: "Second set is better. But none of them says (without explicit words) \"we're
    in creative business\". Are you?\r\n\r\nThe first says \"dog pedigree\" to me,
    the second explicitly says \"tough\" but rounded shapes don't support that. It's
    still better than the first one.\r\n\r\nBut as mentioned: I wouldn't select any
    for design agency/freelance/etc.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: I am "in the creative business," but I don't think a logo needs to smack you
    in the face with that fact.
