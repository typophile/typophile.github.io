body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI have made a logo for a client. The name of the client is within
  the PDF, so they aren't finding this thread while googling their name... \r\n\r\nI
  have tried several ideas, but I think this idea is good. The initials of the name
  is made as ice cream balls like http://www.mylilypads.com/images/products/me-bath-ice-cream.jpg
  ...\r\n\r\nDo you guys have any other ideas how to make this logo???"

  body: rather than trying to fit all the text into ice cream balls, maybe try just
    the "O" leaving "IS". Here is a very very rough sketch. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ISO_5125.gif]

  body: "What about exploring some ideas around the temperture implications of the
    name - some dripping icecream or melting or something. Contrast between hot (weather/sun)
    and cold (icecream) perhaps? Weather map? \r\n\r\nNot really a great fan of the
    ones in the PDF, seems a bit forced - you'll need to do something better with
    the dot on the 'i'. A cherry? Dunno, just some thoughts."

  body: "Mate, please don't mix all the ideas into one logo. Keep it simple simple
    simple simple.\r\n\r\nGet all your ideas down on paper - develop those you think
    have potential, then present two or three polished concepts to the client.\r\n\r\nJust
    out of interest, who is the target audience?"

    been working off my laptop and my wacom crapped out on me. I tried to give you
    and idea off my touchpad.

  body: "The audience wants quality and ecologic. The ice cream is ecologic and has
    no additives and contains only fresh fruit, nuts etc. It's made by a single woman.\r\n\r\nI
    actually liked the idea that it's hand drawn... I've made some examples...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo
    2_6617.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe idea of the colors is that it's ecologic, and fruit, and
    of course a cone.\r\n\r\nIn the other versions I've used AvantGarde as the type.
    Do you have any other suggestions or is the idea too lame?\r\n\r\nI tried to make
    an example where the \"o\" was melting, but it didn't come out well..."

  body: I prefer your original idea in your pdf. These seem so so and expected. Instead
    of trying to make ice cream balls, you might want to  play with the roundness
    of the "S", "O" and the cone. At first glance I read it as a ice cream type of
    company. You just need to work on the readability of the ISO. Good luck. Look
    forward to your progress. mg[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iso_6236.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/iso_5857.jpg]
