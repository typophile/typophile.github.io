  body: "As you suspected, this is a custom typeface; it is called <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=vWwLt69Czv0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA186#v=onepage&q&f=false\">Newface</a>
    and comes in at least three different weights (Light, Regular, Bold). It has been
    drawn by Shelley Winter and Walter Tracy in 1989/1990.\r\n\r\nIt vaguely reminds
    me of Robert Slimbach\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/kepler_std_medium_subhead/?&sample_text=Telegraph&sample_size=96&acs_pt=32&update=0\">Kepler</a>
    that you might like."
