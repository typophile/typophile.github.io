body: Maybe this is the wrong place for it, but I'm wondering if anyone has ever seen
  a typeface where the oblique stress is ninety degrees different from where it is
  in most typefaces, running from top right to bottom left instead of top left to
  bottom right, thereby evoking a pen held with the left hand rather than the right.
  I'm looking for both serif and cursive typefaces to possibly be used in a wedding
  invitation to add a personal touch.
