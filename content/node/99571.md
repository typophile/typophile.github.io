body: "In the book \"Quantum Information and Quantum Computation\" by Nielsen and
  Chuang, they use a font which is undoubtedly Erhardt (judging by the regular text),
  but the italic text seems to be somewhat different from the examples available at
  major foundry sites. See \"ehrhardt-nielsen.png\" and \"ehrhardt-monotype.png\"
  attached which contain the example from the book, and the same text set with Monotype
  Ehrhardt. The book variant is less stretched and, in my opinion, is significantly
  more readable in long italic paragraphs. Does anyone know what subtype is this?\r\n\r\nParts
  of the book are available [[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=-s4DEy7o-a0C&lpg=PP1&dq=quantum%20computation%20and%20quantum%20information&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q=quantum%20computation%20and%20quantum%20information&f=false|on
  Google Books]] (not in particularly good quality though), if you need larger samples
  of text."

  body: "Thank you, this seems to be the case. I was assuming that they have used
    the same typeface for regular and italic text, and only ran the former through
    a font recognition service. The regular text is definitely not in Imprint \u2014
    for example, judging by the shape of the letter Q. "
