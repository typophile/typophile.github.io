  body: "This article is silly. If the FOSS universe gets any nice new system fonts
    it will probably be in the same way MS Office does, by commission. There's no
    reason Novell, Sun or Google can't pay for fonts if the need arises. I think it's
    happened in the past. The oldest open-source myth is that the people who create
    it aren't getting paid. \r\n\r\nI predict that for 99.99% of consumers, the new
    fonts have no effect on whether or not they chose to use Microsoft Office. "

  body: "About 6 years ago there was one lass at college who assumed everything you
    typed had to be done in Times New Roman as if it was an unwritten rule... I'm
    not sure why she thought this (maybe because it was the default choice in Microsoft
    Word) or why she joined the course, but she did leave a few weeks later. Perhaps
    she had a breakdown over the idea of using other fonts!\r\n\r\nStill, at least
    Microsoft are \"experimenting\" with another option as the default font. It'll
    probably involve lots of costly upgrades to the consumer, though. You know, will
    only work with XP Pro edition 2012 or something silly!"

  body: 'Well this is going off-topic a bit, but the switch to Calibri isn''t exactly
    an experiment. Of course Office 2007 hasn''t shipped yet but the new default is
    still there in the latest beta, so unless someone has a serious change of heart
    we''ll be seeing a lot more of that font in the future. Although the font will
    work ''down-level'' it''s definitely been designed for the latest rendering technology.
    There''s plenty of information here and on the blogs if your interested - search
    on "Calibri" '
