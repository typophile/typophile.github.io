body: "Welcome to the second newsletter this year! :)\r\n\r\nHalf of the releases
  this time are fonts made by Levente Halmos - a designer from Hungary, and a welcome
  newcomer to the CheapProFonts stable. The font industry sees more and more new type
  designers coming from eastern Europe, but surprisingly few of them actually cater
  for their own home markets by including all the necessary glyphs... CheapProFonts
  to the rescue! ;)\r\n\r\nIn this news release I present the following 9 fonts:\r\n-
  5 from Levente Halmos\r\n- 2 from Kimberly Geswein\r\n- 1 from Brian Kent\r\n- 1
  from myself! ;)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CheapProFonts-NEWS-09-02_5174.gif]<!--break-->\r\n\r\nWe've
  had our first real \"hit\": Danube Pro has sold really well since its release, and
  actually peaked at 3rd place in MyFonts' Starlets list! At that time CheapProFonts
  actually had 3 fonts on this top50-list! :)\r\nBusiness on our own site has also
  increased, so it seems the public has started to take to the idea of our improved,
  multilingual fonts. Brilliant!\r\n\r\nCheapProFonts is dedicated to supplying high-quality
  OpenType and TrueType fonts for setting \"foreign\" languages (languages requiring
  more than the basic A-Z characters) for professional Mac and Windows users.\r\nCheck
  our site for constant new releases, and see you in the next newsletter!\r\n\r\nRoger

  quality multilingual fonts at a low price - for professional (non-english) designers
  with a small budget!"
