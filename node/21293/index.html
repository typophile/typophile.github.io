		<div class="commentbody"><p>Within the font, there are a couple of ways you could access these smaller smallcaps, and could even employ more than one of these methods. The most obvious OTL feature to use would be the Petite Caps &lsquo;pcap&rsquo; and Capitals to Petite Caps &lsquo;c2pc&rsquo; features. These were specifically designed to support this kind of smaller smallcap, as implemented in Emigre&rsquo;s Mrs Eaves and Filosofia types. See these links:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_pt.htm#pcap">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_pt.htm#pcap</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ae.htm#c2pc">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ae.htm#c2pc</a></p>
<p>In addition, you could treat the smaller smallcaps as stylistic variants of the regular smallcaps, using &lsquo;salt&rsquo; and/or &lsquo;ssXX&rsquo; features.</p>
<p>In terms of present application support, your best bet would be to map the regular smallcap glyphs to the smaller smallcaps glyphs in e.g. the &lsquo;ss01&rsquo; feature. This would make them accessible in Adobe CS2 apps. The Petite Caps features are not supported in any shipping apps, but are supported in the Windows Presentation Format environment and XAML, so will be more accessible in future. It is worth implementing these features now.</p>

Mapping different small caps using smcp and c2sc would be confusing to the user who rightly would expect to see the same small caps regardless of whether they typed UC or lc. Mapping the x-caps to smcp would force the user to do something to fix the text if the result wasn&rsquo;t what they wanted whereas using the petite caps feature would give them full control over what was happening without unexpected results.</p>

<p>feature smcp {

<p>feature c2sc {

<p>feature salt {

<p>if your salt code contains some one-to-one-of-many mappings.)</p>
<p>The &ldquo;ss01&rdquo; feature can be used in InDesign CS2 and in Apple applications on Mac OS X 10.4 (TextEdit, Pages, Keynote). The &ldquo;salt&rdquo; feature can be used in Illustrator CS/CS2.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;pcap&rdquo;/&ldquo;c2pc&rdquo; features can be used e.g. in Apple applications on Mac OS X 10.4 (TextEdit, Pages, Keynote), in Microsoft WPF applications such as the Expression Interactive Designer (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/interactive_designer/">http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/interactive_designer/</a> ), in XeTeX (<a href="http://scripts.sil.org/xetex/">http://scripts.sil.org/xetex/</a> ).</p>

<p>It is already implemented in WPF (just like Adam mentioned)
<a href="http://windowssdk.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.fontcapitals.aspx">http://windowssdk.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.fontcapitals.aspx</a></p>

} smcp;</p>
<p>feature pcap {

<p>Indeed, <em>if</em> you choose to include duplicate &ldquo;a.smcp&rdquo; and &ldquo;A.smcp&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;a.pcap&rdquo; and &ldquo;A.pcap&rdquo;, then the code should be as you suggest. If, however, you decide to only supply one set of small cap glyphs and one set of petite cap glyphs, then I believe it’s better for these glyphs to have uppercase names (before the prefix) so that they fall back to uppercase letters when Unicode codepoints are computed by Acrobat. The reason for this is that all-uppercase text is always correct while all-lowercase is not (i.e. &ldquo;ADAM TWARDOCH&rdquo; is correct text but &ldquo;adam twardoch&rdquo; is not). For this reason, for example, Unicode character names are set in all uppercase.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Robby,</p>
<p>I agree that for small caps, it’s worth considering putting the designs into separate fonts. Small caps is a typographic variation that is on the verge. Small caps deviate from the basic grapheme of the letters much more than ligatures or swashes, but probably less than italic or bold. Of course you’d put italic or bold into separate fonts, and of course you’d put swashes or ligatures into the same font (in OpenType).</p>
<p>But small caps? The makers of the OpenType specification have envisioned the appropriate features, such as &ldquo;smcp&rdquo;, &ldquo;c2sc&rdquo; etc. But this does not mean that you <em>must</em> integrate your small caps into the basic font. Indeed, <em>if</em> you provide a separate small caps font, even people who use Word, Freehand, Corel Draw etc. will be able to use them. Underware puts their small caps into separate fonts, for example.</p>
<p>Note that even if you make a separate OpenType font that has small caps in place of lowercase letters and uppercase letters on the uppercase slots, it’s still useful to include the &ldquo;c2sc&rdquo; feature in that font that substitutes the uppercase by the lowercase:</p>
<p>feature c2sc {
sub [A B C &hellip;] by [a b c &hellip;];
} c2sc;</p>
<p>I think it would be also useful to include a dummy &ldquo;smcp&rdquo; feature a la:</p>
<p>feature smcp { 
sub .notdef by .notdef; 
} smcp;</p>
<p>This will ensure that various applications will &ldquo;register&rdquo; the font as having small caps.</p>

<p>As I say, you’d probably want to put the small caps along with uppercase letters into the separate fonts. You’d still have the kerning between the small caps and the uppercase.</p>
<p>And, for what exact purpose would you want to kern small caps with lowercase? :&gt;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Robby,</p>
<p>If Petite is too gay a word for you, you could call them X-treem concentrated super-potent caps.  ; )</p>
<p>If the 3 styles of caps are already available in PS fonts, why make a new format of font that has to be used the same way? Isn&rsquo;t the benefit of OT that one font can contain all the variants of one weight/style? I don&rsquo;t agree with Adam that small caps are so irrelevant to a basic Roman font. I expect book designers would like very much to be able to have small caps and x-caps in the regular font. Especially since implementing them is as simple as selecting a feature from a menu.  I think small caps will continue to be ignored as long as they reside in separate fonts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard some ideas for the substitutions, and I&rsquo;m sure once the logic is decided and implemented, users will find it very nice to use. See the link on the Mrs. Eaves Open Type page showing the features of that typeface. I don&rsquo;t agree with all the combinations that are available with that design, but you can choose your own and offer different levels of automation to satisfy different kinds of designers. The glyph palette is always there as well, and you get to keep your Cap/small cap kerning.</p>

<p>No, it does not mean that. OpenType substitutions work on the glyph level. The character codes should be principally retained. Only in a situation when the Unicode codepoints are not available, an application can fallback to glyph names. :)</p>

<p>I agree. Indeed, the choice of whether to use the OpenType Layout features or separate fonts for small caps is not necessarily an either-or choice. It can be an &ldquo;and&rdquo; option.</p>
<p>But I think my point is valid in that the small caps represent a case that is on the &ldquo;verge&rdquo; of what is reasonable to be supported through OpenType Layout features.</p>
<p>For example, when making the OpenType conversion, Adobe chose to merge the character sets of Robert Slimbach&rsquo;s Poetica and Matthew Carter&rsquo;s Shelley Script into single OpenType fonts. In case of Poetica, I think that it was a completely founded decision. However, in case of Shelley Script, I&rsquo;d argue that keeping these fonts as separate &ldquo;Shelley Andante&rdquo;, &ldquo;Shelley Allegro&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shelley Volante&rdquo; fonts <em>might</em> have been a good choice <em>as well</em>, or perhaps even a better choice.</p>
<p>In any case, <em>this</em> was an artistic choice, not technical. In some cases, decisions in what to put where in a font, are of technical nature (for example, whether to put ligatures into the &ldquo;liga&rdquo; feature rather than the &ldquo;onum&rdquo; feature). In other cases, like making decisions about stylistic sets or whether a certain ligature should be standard or discretionary, it really is an artistic choice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll argue that in case of small caps, the issue <em>is</em> somewhat on the junction of artistic and technical considerations.</p>
<p>Carl writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I expect book designers would like very 
much to be able to have small caps and 
x-caps in the regular font. 
Especially since implementing them is 
as simple as selecting a feature from 
a menu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a valid point.</p>
<p>On the other hand, today&rsquo;s applications' font menus don&rsquo;t tell me which fonts support which features. If I put a small caps font as a separate font, I&rsquo;ll see it in the WYSIWYG font list of InDesign, Illustrator, Suitcase or Font Explorer along with the other styles. This means that as a font user, I&rsquo;ll be instantly aware of the fact that the particular family includes small caps.</p>
<p>If you show me at least <em>one</em> application that allows me to easily look up which OpenType fonts in the font collection on my computer have small caps (or support any other OpenType feature, for that matter), I&rsquo;ll be very grateful. Seriously.</p>
<p>In other words: these days, in order to do the &ldquo;as simple as selecting a feature from a menu&rdquo; thing, the font user needs to know upfront that a font supports a certain feature. It&rsquo;s not much of a problem for a book designer who uses 2-3 font families but for graphic designers who do avertising etc., and need to deal with large font collections, it is a problem.</p>

<p>One advantage is that the menu name would be quite informative, eg &ldquo;Shinnface with Middle Caps&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;ss03&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on a typeface with a small x-height, and two sizes of small caps appears to be in order. So I am putting the small caps in the standard font, and the &ldquo;Middle Caps&rdquo;, as I term them, in the font &ldquo;Shinnface with Middle Caps&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Also, It&rsquo;s not apparent whether Petite is larger than Small, or vice versa. Or whether a Petite  &ldquo;caps with small caps&rdquo; setting combines Caps with Petite Caps, or Petite Caps with Small Caps. So to avoid confusion, having separate fonts avoids the possibility of a Petite with Small Caps setting, which is an unlikely usage.</p>

<p>InDesign&rsquo;s glyph palette shows only glyphs that are present. No fakes there. The OpenType menu shows features that are built into the specific font you&rsquo;re viewing, with non-functional fetures in brackets.</p>
<p>On the mac, InDesign also shows in the font menu OpenType icons, which is a small clue.</p>
<p>Though these are not what you are asking for, they do solve the problem of finding out which fonts have small caps, to some degree. Of course, it is one application, or suite of apps, and not available system-level, and not available at all without the apps.</p>
<p>The basic complaint here is that one can&rsquo;t tell what capabilities lie within any given font without deeper exploration. This to me is a reason to develop the means to reveal this information, not a reason to make OpenType fonts in several parts.</p>
<p>The thing you are asking for is a worthy project, but probably complex. Is anyone up to the challenge? It would be an interesting utility, or function of the system(s), to show something like Adobe&rsquo;s list of icons; they indicate at a glance (once you understand them) what features are included.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree that Small caps/Petite caps use would be so odd or inadvisable. One benefit of a variety of caps in a font (think Poetica or Operina) is that they can be combined a lot of different ways, some of which allow you to mimic different weights, and which may be more appropriate for certain sizes. Versatile, not confusing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Carl, yes in principle, but the names are confusing.
IMO, a basic small cap is the one that&rsquo;s x-height, or just slightly taller.
However, with small x-height typefaces, room is opened up between x-height and cap height, for another &ldquo;small&rdquo; cap, which I would term &ldquo;Middle Cap&rdquo; &ndash; ergo Full Size, Middle, and Small Caps being the nomenclature. After all, everyone&rsquo;s familiar with S, M, L and XL as designators of size range.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just my logic, obviously Emigre has different ideas.
The thing is, different foundries will interpret OT features in different ways (just as they used to interpret &ldquo;expert&rdquo; set content in different ways in the previous generation of technology).
So what&rsquo;s needed is for software applications, Adobe and Quark of course, to provide the opportunity for foundry-designated descriptors. &ldquo;sso1&rdquo;, for instance, is really hopeless.
Not just a name, but a visual showing would help.</p>
<p>Ideally, an application user could &ldquo;mouseover&rdquo; an item on the menu item, and a panel in the palette showing the U&amp;lc alphabet and figures would change accordingly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Right. Robby&rsquo;s caps are Regular, middle and small. A set smaller than the x-height would be (besides strange) extra-small&hellip;. Since small caps are more generally associated/used with Caps, though, whatever names we give to additional sets of caps shouldn&rsquo;t really refer to the x-height, since even very conventional small caps can be larger than x-height.</p>
<p>I would like for System software to reveal this information; in any app, both clear symbols like Adobe&rsquo;s, plus foundry style names should be shown, since as time goes forward, I suspect those names will become even less standardized. Given the possibilities of OT, and the different things different designers use OT for, we can&rsquo;t possibly predict now what all the eventual style names will be. I&rsquo;m including something I call &ldquo;Cartographic Caps&rdquo; in my next release along with Swash Caps. If a user can&rsquo;t see them or the style name is meaningless, or worse, buried and meaningless, I agree, they&rsquo;re almost the same as not there.</p>
