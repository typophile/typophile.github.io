  serif font.\r\nThe capital 'A' has a look of the NASA font and the rest of the letters
  have a slight sci-fi feel.\r\nI've attached uppercase and lowercase refs if anyone
  can help shed some light.\r\n\r\nThanks, Jamie\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ref3_4977.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ref_5941.jpg]"
