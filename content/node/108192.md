  body: "Can't name it. Pretty convinced it's bespoke typeface, exclusive for 'Seen
    on Living' Corriere della Sera magazine. What I know though is they use exclusive
    typefaces commissioned by [[http://leftloft.it/project/2264/brera-and-solferino|Leftloft]]
    and designed by [[http://www.molotro.com|Molotro Luciano Perondi]]. May be they
    worked on this one as well but that's purely hypothetical.\r\nSome alternatives
    I like without being even loosely similar: [[http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/lydia/bold-condensed|Lydia
    Condensed]], [[http://www.tendollarfonts.com/selador|Selad\xF3r]]"
