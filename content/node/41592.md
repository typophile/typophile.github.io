  and making a tabloid poster representing that. I chose swashes. I would like to
  recieve some feedback on these two, and whether I should go with drop or no drop.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/drop_5285.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nodrop_4900.png]"

    swashed letter, and maybe exagregate the swash.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n"

  body: Narrowing it down? I'm not sure what you mean. I guess I could take out the
    tagline, but every letter of the alphabet must be included.

  body: "Every letter huh? Swash caps aren't meant to be used as a full sentence/line.\r\n\r\nI
    was thinking of something along these lines:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5944.jpg]\r\n\r\nbut
    that might not fit your bill.\r\n\r\nAlso you might want to look into Sudtipos
    <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/2\">Affair</a> for some inspiration."

  body: "\u2022Try using a lighter weight of Bookman, it will look better blown up.\r\n\u2022You
    can do better compositionally. Right now I get the impression that you\u2019re
    focused on  fitting all the letters into a composition rather than making a great
    composition and then rendering it with swashy letters."

  body: "If this is the typeface you wish to use that is ok. This is a good swash
    face to work with. But instead of seeing it as letters what if you view them simply
    as shapes? Make a pattern or a patchwork quilt?\r\n\r\nI'd suggest seeing how
    the Queen of Swash (amongst other things), <a href=\"http://www.bantjes.com/\">Marian
    Bantjes</a> uses the swash in her designs. "

  body: "Thanks guys for the advice. Unfortunately I don't own a computer running
    illustrator so my time with it is limited. I did do a revamp though. [[http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o143/patchho/Picture2-5.png|This
    is the basic layout,]] and [[http://patch.becomearobot.com/weblog/|this is what
    i've started doing to it.]]\r\n\r\nI don't think my layout is particularly strong
    but it's the best I could do with limited lab time."

  body: The sample shown looks like one of my fonts called Meola Bookman (circa 1965).
    I had over 245 characters in the font. If you ever run across a Facsimile Font
    catalog you will see a complete showing of my version of Bookman swashes

    is what I printed]]\r\n\r\nwell i fucked up on the alphabet, i think I might redo
    it just as uppercase letters and have one of each for my portfolio later."
