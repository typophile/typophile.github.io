<div class=commentbody>Added note. When I sent the fonts I wanted to the shopping cart not only was there a $5 discount as stated on font screen, but there was an additional discount. It showed that I could get the 4 fonts I needed for $35 instead of $99 at Phils or FF. I do all my work at no charge for non-profits so I guess sometimes I do need to be a sucker. But if it works, its okay by me. You can call me a sucker anytime I save a $ and get a good product.

<div class=commentbody>I'm thinking of starting a website called 'Under the table fonts dot com'. When a designer like Dawn finds a great deal like $35 instead of $99 for fonts that some type designer has in good faith licensed to some vendor, in the belief that he's going to make some money in royalties, the designer can come to 'Under the table...' and send a confidential message to the original type designer asking if he or she will accept $35 to buy a license under the table (confidential and under the table because so as not to undermine the value at which the type designer would prefer to be selling his type). If the type designer agrees, he or she gets the full $35, instead of a percentage of a percentage of a percentage of a discounted discounted price, and the designer gets the fonts with the added joy of putting his or her money in the hands of a type designer, with the only caveat that he or she agrees to keep quiet. <br> <br>Of course, the long term solution, for the type designer at least, <i>is to stop signing contracts that allow vendors to cross license and discount prices.</i></div>

<div class=commentbody>Isn't it odd that all the fonts they sell seem to be from the Adobe Type Library, or fonts that <i>used</i> to be in the ATL, but aren't any more (i.e., fonts from Berthold such as Formata)? It all seems a bit fishy to me. I mean, did they actually negotiate with Adobe and pay them a "large chunk of money" for their entire library (as they suggest on their about page) to allow them to sell Adobe Garamond or Minion at a discount? It seems rather implausible on the face of it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>They didn't license the fonts from us (Adobe).

<div class=commentbody>Hi Daniel, <br> <br>> How's the OpenType library coming? <br> <br>Well, we finished converting our existing type library early in the year (we were almost done last year, except for a handful of stragglers). There are about 35 fonts we can't ship in OpenType format because our licensing doesn't allow for it, but the other 2250 or so are all out there. <br> <br>I'll have a presentation at ATypI this weekend that's a "technology preview" of Unicode and OpenType functionality in a future version of Adobe Illustrator. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's very scary what you can find on the net after a few simple searches and viewing source code. I found out that this site is registered on Tucows and Tucows listed an address and a phone under their domain listing. The address is for a Mailboxes N More in Everett, WA and the phone # is not a valid phone # (several reverse searches on the big guys revealed no such number). The Sec of State in WA website did not list this company so I emailed them and they said no such company existed in the state of WA nor was there any pending paper work. Oh, well, such much for the bargain of the week. I'm off to Phils!</div>
