  has been in widespread use in National Geographic maps since the 1960s.\r\n\r\n<a

  works really well when used in mixed case for short words (town names, etc).  <a
  href=\"http://www.globecorner.com/i/t/GWgermd.GIF\">Here</a> you can see it used
  as part of an atlas.\r\n\r\nI've heard that National Geographic has their own \"customized
  fonts\", but really something close will suffice.  WhatTheFont turns up nothing
  (it even crashes) and Identifont is just way out in left field.  I've also Googled
  this to death and found nothing.  Another example is attached."

    target=\"_blank\">Goudy Sans</a> when I saw this. It's got a nice similar feel.\r\n\r\n
