  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Everyone.

I am webmaster of an association's website that hosts scanned images of vintage books on calligraphy and penmanship: http://www.iampeth.com/books.htm 

Today I was contacted by a typographer that would like to create a couple of fonts from some images on our website, that were originally published in a book: 

http://www.iampeth.com/books/dennis_pen_art/dennis_pen_art_page27.html
http://www.iampeth.com/books/dennis_pen_art/dennis_pen_art_page28.html

The artwork in the book was created by W.E. Dennis, and published in 1914 by the A.N. Palmer Company.

If we agree to provide high-resolution scans of these pages to aid this typographer in his creation, could IAMPETH (the owner of the website) be liable at all?  Would we be violating any type of copyright laws?

I would be very grateful for any advice you could offer.

Trying to do the right thing,

James Ivey
Dallas, Texas

		<div class="commentbody">I suppose if I were in this line of business I would provide scans without providing any specific rights or permissions regarding how they could be used, only how they can't be used. So I guess what i'm asking is under what terms do you provide the scans?

Wow.  Haven't even considered that.  Since we (IAMPETH) don't own the copyright for the book or the artwork, it didn't even occur to me to consider terms of use.

I guess part of the dilemna is, since we don't own the copyrights, is it even our permission to give?

If he (the typographer) were breaking any laws by creating and selling the font, would we (IAMPETH) be getting ourselves into hot water by providing the scans?  kind of like "aiding and abetting" a law-breaker... that kind of thing.</div>

I don't know if it matters, but the images/website is hosted in the United States, and the typographer is in Germany.  The book was published here in the U.S.

And thanks for the link.  Good stuff.</div>

James, I think your totally safe in providing the scans, but it does seem strange that the type designer is asking your permission to make a font from them. Like buying a gun and asking permission of the gun shop owner to go shoot tin cans off a fence.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks sii.  He's really not asking for our permission, he's just asking for some high resolution scans.  We've got the original book, and he needs high-res images to start creating his font.  We just want to make sure that we (IAMPETH) are not exposing ourselves legally by helping him make his fonts.

I'm like you though... I think we're safe.  I'm ready to go for it, but we've got cooler heads than mine that are expressing concern.</div>

If the book is in the public domain (as it likely is), go nuts :-)

pugnax - How could I determine if the copyright has been renewed? The publisher, A.N. Palmer Company is no longer in business.

Lex - We did not get any copyright permissions on this particular book.  We figured it was public domain since it was printed in 1914.</div>
