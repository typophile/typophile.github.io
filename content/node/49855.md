  wondering if anyone might be able to identify the typeface used in this image. The
  one that spells 'les immat\xE9riaux', not the Pompidou bit. Not sure if this was
  done by hand or not, but if anyone can spot it, that would be amazing.\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"

    and it may have been hand drawn (the stat machine was still going strong!) But
    you may want to have a look at [[http://www.emigre.com/|Emigre's]] Citizen, Triplex
    and Lunatix all from the late 1980s for a similar flavor.\r\n\r\nOf course it
    may also be a font - in which case someone else may have just the perfect reply."
