body: "I am a high school drafting teacher in British Columbia (Canada).  Another
  teacher in the district set me on to an assignment that he was using, which has
  the students dissect a 300 pt. Times New Roman character, and then recreate that
  letter at 3x300 pt.  By dissect I remain approximate curves (diameters and centers;
  grid methods), measuring line lengths and locating line intersections.  Although
  we will be moving on to AutoCAD later in the year, I should also say that we are
  doing this exercise using manual drafting.\r\n\r\nA few questions:\r\nCan anyone
  recommend any similar ideas which I could use in my classroom?  \r\n\r\nOne thing
  which I found out pretty quickly, which I am sure everyone on this forum knows already,
  is that most of the curves in Times New Roman characters aren't actually arcs (ie
  circle segments).  What fonts could I use for this exercise which might be more
  simple because they make use of true arcs?  \r\n\r\nAny recommendations for resources
  that I could use?  A book or web resource, perhaps, which deconstructs fonts?  \r\n\r\nIf
  I were to buy one book and one book only on font design for my classroom, what would
  it be?  \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any ideas you might have.\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think Avant Garde uses purely linear and circular strokes (I'd have to
    inspect it closely to be sure), but that might be too literal an example. Other
    geometric sans like Futura appear to be built of lines and arcs at first glance,
    but the curves even in that have subtle changes.\r\n\r\nAs for a book, Designing
    Type by Karen Cheng gets recommended frequently. \r\nThere are lots of websites
    that deal with type anatomy and construction. I think many are listed in the Typowiki
    here."
