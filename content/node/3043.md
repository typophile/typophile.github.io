  silly as it sounds, but I especially like the filled, non-shaded versions of it..
  <BR>So, now, my question would be, are there any other typefaces, that look kinda
  similar.? <BR>Could you please name some &#39;Federal&#39; look-a-likes.? <BR>&#40;
  I dont want a ripped off font hint, I am just seeking a similar style, if that makes
  any sense.. &#41; <BR> <BR>&#42; In the need for better words.. &#42; <BR> <BR>Thanks
  a lot, fellow Tyophiles.. <BR> '

    Madrone</a> is the obvious alternative.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>&#40; I like &#39;Federal&#39; because it got a round
    and somehow organic feel to it.. <BR>Especially the serifs themself and connections,
    so it seems.. &#41; <BR> <BR>Hmm, does this make any sense.? Hopefully it does..
