  a squarish sans to complement the curves of Feijoa.  Or would such a contrast be

    Since this is a book - I would probably go with something that is more stylistically
    related. If it were a magazine, I think you could play more with the headings.

  body: "> <cite>The lowercase a in Seravek is very distracting... almost cartoony.</cite>\r\n\r\nMike,
    do you mean the lowercase 'a' in Vista Sans?  That's the one some people often
    point out as problematic.\r\n\r\nRelato (i like the regular, but don't like the
    italics)\r\nMundo (possible)\r\nMyriad (i tried it out and didn't give me the
    warm fuzzies)\r\n\r\nI'm looking at a printed sample of FF Milo right now and
    getting lots of warm fuzzies while still getting that neutral look from it.  It
    looks really good paired with Feijoa.\r\n\r\nAlso, it works out better to get
    the single weights because the bundles don't offer a significant difference in
    price.\r\n\r\nSo I'm leaning toward licensing the Text, Text Italic, Regular,
    Regular Italic, Medium, and Bold of FF Milo right now and sorta creating my own
    bundle.\r\n\r\nRahim\r\n"

  body: "Hi Rahim:\r\n\r\nI love the lowercase a in Vista but as for pairing it with
    Feijoa... it feels too technical. Seravek is too wobbly.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m thinking
    you should go with something, such as Milo, that is so neutral and geometric to
    the point of being invisible. \r\nThe reason for this being that Feijoa has so
    much personality, it might create a busy page.\r\n\r\nWhat is your book about?\r\n\r\nAlso
    look at Maurea (similar to Kievit but much less expensive)\r\n\r\nRonnia is another
    alternative to Milo if you can chance it."

  body: "Hi Mike:\r\n\r\nThanks for the clarification.  I see what you're saying now.\r\n\r\nYou
    know what made me think Vista Sans could be literary as well as technical?  There
    are [[http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=200|specimens on Emigre's website]]
    that have text that starts off with, \"I sit in the shade of an ancient, dying
    juniper tree...\"  I read that and thought, wow, this might work for some more
    literary stuff too.  But you're right, Feijoa *and* Vista Sans saturate the page
    with so much character that it would be difficult to create a harmonious contrast.\r\n\r\nYup,
    I've 95% decided to go with FF Milo.  It just looks better than anything else
    I've seen.\r\n\r\nMaurea was a total surprise.  I had not heard of it.  Looks
    nice.  Lots of weights.  OpenType.  And so affordable.  Thanks for letting me
    know.\r\n\r\nI'm waiting to use Ronnia somewhere in the distant future.  I like
    it very much.\r\n\r\nMy book is about how people today can use the wisdom of the
    world's religions in practical ways to raise the quality of the happiness in their
    actual daily lives.  You could say I am taking those wisdom teachings, removing
    all foreign terminology, unhelpful dogma, and uncritical mythology, and putting
    them in a blender and making a smoothie that is both tasty (relevant) and nourishing
    (effective).\r\n\r\nAnd it will be set in Feijoa and FF Milo (unless I change
    my mind again). Ha! :)\r\n\r\nRahim\r\n"

  body: Milo looks good to me. There are just enough subtle design details to keep
    it from being another generic, neutral sans. Good luck on your project, it sounds
    interesting.

    I hadn''t looked at it before, and it''s quite impressive. You''d think after
    so many humanist sans recently, another would be ho-hum, but this one manages
    to be strong while being not severe, but a bit soft and inviting. '

    I use this quite often lately - it's a great headline face, and also works for
    limited runs of body text.
