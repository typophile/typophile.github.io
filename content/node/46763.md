body: "So I am designing a to go menu in InDesign and am trying to figure out the
  correct measurement.\r\n\r\nIts an awkward paper size, but its based off the measurements
  of the old one, anyway it has a tri-fold with each page being 5.25 wide and 8.5
  tall(Client says its a book size, ill admit that I am a newb).  I want everything
  to center correctly so I divide 5.25/2 and come up with 2.6.  Pretty Basic right?
  \ So what does 2.6 = to in actuall inches terms?  I try to make a fraction with
  2.6 and get 2 3/5ths.\r\n\r\nReally want to know where to place my guide!\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

  body: You rounded too much. Half of 5.25 is 2.625 = 2 5/8.

  body: "So the original sheetsize is 15.75 by 8.5?\r\n\r\nThis is how I'd do it.
    \r\nStart a new document, and in the dialog box enter these measurements:\r\n\r\n2
    pages, and Uncheck Facing Pages \r\n(The first page is your inside, the second
    the outside)\r\n\r\nPage size will be custom \r\nWidth 15.75 in\r\nHeight 8.5
    in\r\n\r\nColumns 2 Gutter .5 in (1/2 inch) (the gutters are where the folds will
    occur)\r\n\r\nMargins (click the chain link so it's broken)\r\nTop and Bottom
    .5 in (1/2 inch)\r\nLeft and Right .25 in (1/4 inch)\r\n\r\nRemember, if you want
    deeper margins on the left and right, you need to double that number for the gutter
    of you columns, so .5 in left and right margins = 1 in gutters.\r\n\r\n"
