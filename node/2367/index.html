		<div class="commentbody">Providing the font was installed correctly &#40;perhaps see if it appears in the font menu of any other program the person has on their computer&#41; it will appear in AppleWorks &#40;previously called ClarisWorks, by the way&#41;. <BR> <BR>There are basically two ways to set type in AppleWorks. One is using the word processor &#40;which, like Tiffany mentions, is similar to Word&#41; and the second is within a text block as part of the drawing module. The drawing module allows you to scale, stretch, rotate, etc. the block of text &#40;which can still be edited, of course.&#41; <BR> <BR>I am guessing that if the person cannot &#34;set&#34; the typeface, it&#39;s because it is not installed properly. The first thing I would ask them is if the font appears in the AppleWorks font menu.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I use the database part of Appleworks 6 on Mac OS 9 for student grades. Darren Wilson, who taught the course with me at one time, set up the templates which I use for this. It&#39;s great, and I wouldn&#39;t say that an alternative to the incredibly bloated Word is dumb, quite the oposite in fact. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve never had a problem with being able to set fonts in the database part of Appleworks. If a poorly-manufactured student font shows up when double-clicked in ATM, it sets in Appleworks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, <BR> <BR>This is encouraging. Sorry it was late last night and that is why you lost me. But your encouragements led the customer to successfully set type. <BR> <BR>The problem with this font, <i>cough, cough,</i> the good  thing about this font is that it is multi-coloured. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/JacobeanInitials.html" target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/JacobeanInitials.html</a> <BR> <BR>So the fellow needs to be able to set, copy, and then layer the colours on top of each other. <BR> <BR>First, can the fellow colour the font? I imagine the answer is yes. <BR> <BR>Second question is, can the fellow accurately layer  the fonts on top of each other?  Or is  it visual placement only? <BR> <BR>This fellow is most brave. It is his first font purchase, and first font installation. Frankly I need half a pot of coffee before thinking about working with this <i>user friendly font.</i> I just like to be prepared for the beauty of the results. <BR> <BR>Alright, it is hard for me to say bad things about a font that does nice things. I think you understand. <BR> <BR>Probably I should write a manual for this font. Maybe I should spend some time with fringe software. I am so bare bones here. There is no toys or nice things for me to work with. <BR> <BR>Keep thinking about boats. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>
