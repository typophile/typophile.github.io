    opened the tracking 75 units to try to match the sample. It may be a distortion
    from the video or it may be just widened a bit as well (looking at the \"N\")\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n"

  body: 'Thanks Mike and Chris! So I''m assuming that they used pre-digital Headliner''s
    Arrow since  the Deer Hunter was made in 1978. Did Headliner''s have a film type
    library or was it metal? It''d be interesting to know since Headliners has been
    around since 1951 before Treacyfaces acquired their fonts. Anyone know? '
