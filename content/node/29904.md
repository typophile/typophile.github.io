  a compagnion for <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11670.0.0\"
  target=\"_blank\">FF Milo</a>.\r\nFF Milo has (extremely) short ascenders and descenders
  - so the \"classic\" antiquas don't really go with it, i think. One i found so far,
  is Arnhem (OurType) \u2013 do you have other suggestions? Arnhem has a quite similar
  x-height, but Arnhem offers a different Capital-M, which could be a problem.\r\nThe
  face should offer OSF and a minimal range of weights \u2013 regular, italic, bold,
  bold italic.\r\n  \r\nThanks in advance, T.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=fedra%20serif">Fedra
    Serif</a> might work.

  body: "Thank you for your suggestions - x-height/short stems/antiqua(-like), the
    right \"M\", all matches \u2013 but\r\n\r\nAfter i printed the Fedra Serif A PDF,
    i think, it speaks too loud for Milo.\r\nDolly is versatile, but this time not,
    not with Milo.\r\nChapparal Pro, i always forget this CS font, pardon i don't
    like it that much aesthetically.\r\nI mess around with the PDF of Gerard Ungers
    Capitolium (and C. News)\u2013 that looks promising, but it is quite expensive\u2026\r\n\r\nWe
    don't stop here :) Please more"
