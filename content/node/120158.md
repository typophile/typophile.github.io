    awfully squooshed\r\n'Painting & Decorating Services': no Dutch 766 but [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/hoefler-text/overview|Hoefler
    Text]] (comes bundled with iOS) and again terribly stretched\r\n\r\nEDIT: even
    hardly squooshed, can't be Hoefler Text. Fivos is right, should be Sabon Italic."

    was using; thanks for the Tip. \r\nand Cooperplate Light is what I have used in
