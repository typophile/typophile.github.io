body: Hello! <BR> <BR>We suspect that we have some corrupted fonts that are  freezing
  up our computers at work. <BR> <BR>Is there any software that would catch corrupted
  fonts? Norton Utilities is not doing complete job on that... <BR> <BR>I appreciate
  your help. Thank you!!

    powerful &#34;fix-it&#34; application, it is important to be knowledgeable about
    what you&#39;re &#34;okaying&#34;, otherwise you could do some damage. <BR> <BR><a

    think a messed up TrueType or OpenType font may be messing with their Windows
    machines this tool might help locate the offending font... <BR> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/validator/default.htm"

    <BR> <BR>Also the more recent versions of Windows with all the security patches
    in place do a much better job of identifying the bad fonts and stopping them from
    screwing things up, than say Windows 98. <BR> <BR>Si
