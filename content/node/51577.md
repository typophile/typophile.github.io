  body: I consider understanding how to use a grid very important to graphic design
    education. Maybe I'm old school, but I believe you must understand the rules in
    order to understand how to break them.

  body: "I agree Miss Tiffany. But I don't think it is old school.\r\n@ N-Jay-G: Have
    a look at this website: http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/simple_steps_to_designing_grids/\r\n\r\nWe
    all design for an audience. We should at least.\r\nIn normal circumstances you
    want to aid the reader in reading the text.  \r\nBy giving this text (and other
    content) in small readible chuncks, you will help the reader.\r\n\r\nUsing a grid
    does the same. A well designed grid will present the content in a pleasant way
    and also presents a structure, an order in that content. This troughout a complete
    book or magazine.\r\n\r\nBut even when you are designing a flyer, your design
    could benefit from a well designed grid since a well designed grid is also a pleasant
    grid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is up to you to design a grid which will be true for your
    design style."

  body: "Yes.\r\n\r\nBut, grids themselves and how you use them are 2 different things,
    and both are important. I think most of the time the grid should be invisible
    to the viewer, but it can be used in a more dominant way to great effect too.\r\n\r\nIn
    the 90's grid-based design had a bit of a falling out thanks to David Carson,
    and the hordes of imitators, but thankfully grids, simplicity and logic are, and
    have been, making a comeback."

  body: Grid systems and use of them are an essential part of design education. However,
    it should carry a small role in comparison to concept development. The message
    being communicated often decides the value of the final piece.
