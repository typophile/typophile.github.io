  Sorry the Anne Klein came out so ragged. Many thanks.  --Fred[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Anne_4880.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Phi_5962.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Proenza_5929.gif]

  body: I'm so sorry to trouble you again, but I'm still having trouble with the Anne
    Klein.  I know the sample I posted was crummy, and I apologize.  I believe the
    ANNE KLEIN heading is the same type as the following text.  Does this sample help
    with the i.d.?  Again, please forgive my naivete.  I'm totally new to this enterprise
    in which you are expert. --Fred[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Anne text_6072.gif]

  body: "I was assuming that the text and the ANNE KLEIN header were the same font,
    but maybe I was wrong. In any case it's the ANNE KLEIN that I'm trying to i.d.
    \ I'm pretty sure that is not Venus or any of the Gothics. I don't think we've
    got Proenza Schouler either. I don't mean to presume, but I wish someone could
    nail these the way bjharvey and Bald Condensed nailed Marc Jacobs in 2004. If
    I'm wrong and in fact marcox's i.d.'s are correct, I will be happy.  I just want
    to get these right. \r\n\r\nIt's the E in ANNE KLEIN that is most interesting,
    and the O in Proenza Schouler that is not quite fitting with the suggestions.
    Here is an attempt at a better image of ANNE KLEIN.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Anne

  body: The Anne Klein "Fall 2007" body copy is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.103091.0.1">Monotype
    Grotesque Light</a>, which indeed shares similarities with both Bitstream's Vonness
    and URW's (originally Berthold's?) Venus. The Anne Klein logo is indeed Akzidenz-Grotesk
    Light.
