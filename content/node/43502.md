body: So I have been thinking of submitting a talk to Atypi for the 2008 meeting in
  St. Petersburg Russia. Any thoughts on what it will cost to be there? Have you been
  there before? What did you do? How much Russian (language) do you need to learn?
  What about visa/entry issues?

    enter. You will probably have to apply for this long in advance. I have even been
    told (although I cannot verify this yet) that you have to book your accommodation
    before you can apply for a visa. Your hotel will send you a letter that states
    that you really will be staying there at the certain dates, etc.\r\n\r\nI've been
    to the past four ATypI conferences, and am really looking forward to this year's.
    I'm sure that even a little bit of Russian would go a long way in St. Petersburg,
    but I'll be so busy writing my dissertation in the weeks (and days\u2026) leading
    up to the conference that I doubt I will be able to learn any myself."

    by using a Visa Service? Or does it not matter?\r\n\r\nIf anybody has picked a
    hotel to stay in and is willing to tell me privately what hotel that is I would
    be glad for the info."

  body: "Technically you cannot get tourist visa (which is strongly recommended) until
    you have your hotel booking. So any \"visa service\" includes hotel booking.\r\n\r\nFor
    hotels there are 2 options: small hotels (also called \"mini hotels\") and regular
    hotels. Small hotels may be unusual: sometimes they occupy only a part of the
    building. So you may share building entrance with either regular (and usually
    quite old) condo. It somtimes is interesting and lets you better feel how it is
    here. But there will be no lobby bar :). Most mini hotels are in walking distance
    from conference venue in the area which is filled with restaurants and caffees.\r\n\r\nThere
    are few regular hotels. \"Moscow\" is the one where we have booked many rooms
    (http://www.hotel-moscow.ru/english/home.htm). It is OK, was recently renovated
    and is only a one metro (subway, tube) stop away (metro station is practically
    IN the hotel lobby). List of prebooked hotels is here: http://onlinereg.ru/site.php?go=106&page=1464&lang=ENG\r\n\r\nOn
    that list only \"U Fontana\" and \"Rossiya\" are located outside the center and
    will require several stop metro ride to reach the conference venue. While OK on
    weekend, it may be crowded on a weekday morning while taxi ride may take a lot
    of time due to traffic in the rush hour.\r\n\r\nVisa:\r\nTruth is that getting
    visa is usually much easier than you might expect. There are 3 recommended ways:\r\n\r\n1.
    Do hotel booking and visa processing trough Monomax: http://onlinereg.ru/atypi.
    They are prepared to help you and their service was checked by Barbara who visited
    SPb few months ago.\r\n2. Do hotel booking using one of online services and contact
    hotel to send you visa voucher. It will be less expensive than using Monomax (there
    is no extra payment), but you will be on your own while dealing with your local
    Russian Consulate (http://www.russianembassy.net/). \r\n3. Contact any local tourist
    company who will guide you trough process.\r\n\r\nTwo important things to know:\r\n1.
    Your passport must be valid at least 6 months after you plan to leave Russia.\r\n2.
    You are getting tourist, not business visa. It is much easier and cheaper. There
    is no problem with that: SPb is the tourist destination, one of the top in Europe.\r\n\r\nSo
    the process is (explained here: http://atypi.org/05_Petersburg/visas)\r\n1. Check
    that your passport is valid.\r\n2. Make hotel booking. Get voucher and confirmation
    from the hotel. Make sure that hotel you are dealing with is \"compatible\" with
    visa requrements (you need it only if you are not using Monomax as service company).
    Which means that they can send you a voucher (they are registered somewhere) and
    they can handle registration of your passport while you are here. Almost all hotels,
    especially located in the city center have these services.\r\n3. Prepare application
    (form is downloadable and Monomax will provide you with instructions how to fill
    it). Have your photo. Check any other requirements with your local consulate.
    Mail them all that or visit their office. \r\n4. Get your visa and verify it.\r\n\r\nAccording
    to rules, in many consulates there is time/cost system. You may pay more, but
    have your visa ready fast. So it is up to you how much you want to pay. It does
    not work with all consulates, make sure you checked it. But in Russian consulates
    in US for $$$ you can have your visa ready same day.\r\n\r\nBegin early. Contact
    me in case of any problems. Use my email address which is yar at fontlab.com."

    in all Schengen countries (most of EU with few exceptions). I know that in US
    fax copy works fine. When I asked Monomax about this, they said that fax copy
    is generally OK. Bascically you will need to have \"original\" voucher only if
    it is specifically required by the consulate in your country. \r\n\r\nAs I know,
    quoted hotel prices include taxes and are final. It must be said that you may
    find a better deal over the internet, but in this case you will have to contact
    hotel directly for voucher and instructions. "

    I am working hard not to.\r\n\r\nMy advice to other people (although they may
    not need it) is when you are on the monomax site don't expect buttons to look
    like buttons. The buttons are just narrow rectangles with text. I thought they
    were headings for text for a long time...\r\n\r\nYuri, do you know or are you
