body: "this font is from the clothing company, Misericordia, and i at firsthought
  it was a cutstom font from the title, but it appears not by the body copy being
  more unified..\r\n\r\nIf anybody could shed some light on the name of this font
  would be greatly appreciated :)\r\n\r\ncheers."

  body: I'm guessing the logo is hand lettered, and then a typeface was made to emulate
    it.

    has some similarities, though it's less Latino.

  body: this actually reminds me quite a bit of <a href="http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=ALSO-MESR">Metroscript</a>
    for some reason.

  body: a few minutes with difference layers in Photoshop reveals that if this isn't
    hand-lettered, it's been modified so much that no two characters are the same.

    admit it does look familiar though. If we find out who did it, I will probably
    have to slap my forehead."

  body: "It reminds me of <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptSmall6/Spoleto.gif\">Spoleto</a>,
    which is a.k.a. Sport Script, etc. that has been modified (s and l were first
    obvious new letters) and backslanted. I can see there are variations in identical
    letters, so is this hand-drawn or an OpenType font with lots of alternates? Also
    made me think of some of the faux-Coke lettering fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
