body: I am working on a logo and want to use the Linotype Notec as the basic font
  for it. I would like to set the subline in a Sans Serif. Maybe something like Parisine
  Bold Italic. Is it a good mix or is their an other font that would be a better choice
  with a similar character?

  body: Any sans will go with Notec. Your choice depends most on the company and its
    audience.

  body: The logo is for a spa-center. The target group are people around 30 years
    old. It should look modern, selfmade and simple(not extravagant but also not grungy).
    Also it should be readable at very small sizes.
