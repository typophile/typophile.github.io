  <BR>I&#39;m looking for the &#34;XL55&#34; and &#34;movie camera&#34; fonts. This
  is from a manual to an old super 8 camera. Thanks!

  body: XL55 looks like some form of the font Machine. But with three distinct characters
    and hard angles I would bet on hand drawn. They probably photostated the second
    5.
