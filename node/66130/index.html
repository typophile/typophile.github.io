  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey, so I&rsquo;ve had a love for typography for years, but have just started getting into designing fonts. I bought a copy of TypeTool for Christmas and I&rsquo;ve been itching to get started. My first font idea came from a CD cover I designed for a Christmas present this year. I wanted to have the word &ldquo;SMASH&rdquo; in a cartoony, ultra-condensed font that would take up the whole cover, both horizontally and vertically. I couldn&rsquo;t find anything out there that was compressed enough for this job, so I ended up drawing my own type for it in Illustrator. When I started thinking about designing my first font, I figured if I couldn&rsquo;t find anything like this, maybe there will be someone else looking for a font like this to fill a design need so I thought I&rsquo;d flesh it out and see how it took. I&rsquo;m quite surprised with how much I&rsquo;m liking it.</p>
<p>However, I wanted to post it here to see what some more experienced type designers have to say. As I said, I&rsquo;m a beginner, this is my first font, but I would like it to be very professional. I&rsquo;m in the midst of designing all of the standard glyphs, and I&rsquo;m considering putting it up for sale on MyFonts, although I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s of good enough quality. There&rsquo;s a few characters I think might need a bit of tweaking, but I thought I&rsquo;d see what everyone here thinks. So, what do you all think of it? I&rsquo;m eager to hear your input.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">This looks pretty well designed. If you could post a pdf it would help to see how well crafted the contours are. 
My only comments on this would be that the C leaves a large white space on its right side; I think the arms could extend further to even the colour out. And the M gets very cloggy and dark; perhaps you could trap the counters a bit?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks! I&rsquo;m linking below to a PDF that you can check out. I still have some overlapping shapes that I have to merge together, but it should give you a good idea of my contours. No idea if they&rsquo;re good or bad, so let me know. I know there&rsquo;s a few characters that are a little rough that I plan on doing a bit of tweaking on (the &ldquo;S&rdquo; comes to mind, and I&rsquo;m not sure I like the G.). I haven&rsquo;t had the time to work on your suggestions for the C and the M yet, but they do make sense and sound like a very good idea. Thanks so much for the input! Here&rsquo;s a link to the PDF:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think this is really good stuff and outstanding for a first font.</p>
<p>You may want to try making the counters extend further into the M instead of or in addition to trapping the angles. Notice how on your W the highest part of the bottom counter goes higher than the lowest part of the top counters? That prevents the situation in your M where the black goes the full width of the letter.</p>
<p>P looks weak to me.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s some unhappy tension between the asymmetry of the S, with its low spine, and the halfway structure of letters like BHE.</p>
<p>On some glyphs the angles you use start to take on a three-dimensional illusion that is distracting. It&rsquo;s mostly the characters that have a horizontal at the top or bottom - I first noticed it on the two and five, but it also happens on the 7 and E. Did you or would you think about not using the same angle that you use for the ends of the strokes on those &ldquo;horizontals&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Is the flare on the R&rsquo;s leg a little overdone? I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow. Thanks so much for this feedback, it&rsquo;s great! I did a bit of work on a few more of the characters tonight, taking most of your suggestions into account. Below is a sample of the font before the edit on top and after the edit underneath.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Implodium-Jan13_6492.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>The characters I made edits to are the C, E (less &ldquo;3D&rdquo;), P, M, L (slightly thinned and less &ldquo;3D&rdquo;), G and R.</p>
<p>I really like the swashy leg on the R, personally, but it doesn&rsquo;t work that well with a lot of the characters. Since I&rsquo;m not planning on doing the lowercase characters for this font, I thought I could use the uppercase set for swashes, so I could include both versions of the R in the font. (I&rsquo;d do them as OpenType alternates but I currently only have TypeTool.)</p>
<p>As for the 3D look of some characters, I think I will back a few of those off a bit (I did already with the L and bottom horizontal stroke of the E) but I don&rsquo;t want to make them completely horizontal. I really like the slightly skewed look of the font.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ll work on it some more and upload a new PDF a little later, but I wanted to show the changes and thank you both for your input. Let me know if you have any other suggestions.</p>
<p>Oh, and one final question about the name. First, do you think Implodium is a fitting and catchy name? No offense if you think it&rsquo;s stupid. Second, should it be &ldquo;Ultra Compressed&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ultra Condensed&rdquo;? Is there a difference between a compressed and condensed font?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>All improvements I think, except that I too liked the descending R leg - I just wondered if it should flare (get broader in stroke width) so much as it goes down. /P/ and /M/ look great now.</p>
<p>/G/ is better and more fitting, but you may want to raise the crossbar (and consequently the overhanging part at the top) to make it more distinguishable from a /C/.</p>
<p><em> Is there a difference between a compressed and condensed font?</em></p>
<p>Some discussion here: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/41849">http://typophile.com/node/41849</a></p>
<p>I know this was sparked by comic books but it makes me think of painted signs on big windows at a car dealership a generation or two ago. That commercialist, retro flavor isn&rsquo;t captured by Implodium to me, although the jokey, action-packed feel does fit pretty well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>These are definite improvements. I prefer &lsquo;compressed&rsquo; for this style, but that&rsquo;s not based on any reasoning at all. &lsquo;Implodium&rsquo; is a cool name. I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to look at your pdf yet, will do though.</p>
<p>Two ideas. G might be less easily confused with C if you add a spur on the bottom right. The middle arm of E could be longer; it looks kind of stubby.</p>
