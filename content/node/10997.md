    60s, I think- people were giving all kinds of credit to icon-based communication.
    But then the illusion wore off, and people &#34;resigned&#34; to using actual
    sentences and words and stuff. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: This is a screenshot from my portfolio. When &#34;setting&#34; these icons,
    I fussed over the kerning just as one would when setting type. Is this the type
    of non-font typography the HOW article refers to? <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/887.jpg"

  body: ' ok i should have explained- the article is about how the author of the article
    has noticed that &#34;more and more designers are turning away from pre-fabricated
    fonts and toward handlettering, found objects, or other non-font solutions to
    fulfill their typographic needs.&#34; and yes the tracking throughout the magazine
    is off but im going for something else. '

  body: ' The problem I had with this article- the author of the article talks about
    how designers are more and more using &#34;non-font&#34; solutions. Isnt that
    what good designers do anyway? But what I&#39;ve noticed is more and more designers
    turning to uncreative font solutions- like the person who designed this spread.
    You&#39;re designing a spread about not using fonts, AND THEN YOU GO AHEAD AND
    MAKE A BORING SPREAD USING A COUPLE ORDINARY FONTS THAT WERE NOT EVEN KERNED.
    damn this mag sucks. It reeks of amateur hell. '

  body: ' I don&#39;t have a problem with using type to communicate a story about
    not using type. It might be fairly literal to use handwriting/rubberstamps/chickenfeet/whatever,
    but that doesn&#39;t make it clever, or necessarily appropriate. Presumably there
    were illustrations which served to communicate the process of non-font design? '
