body: I have a client who fired their designer, but the guy won't cough up the font
  he used to do a lot of their work, and my budget is really tight.

    package.\r\n\r\nEmigre's Arbitrary Sans has a similar look but you only get 2
    weights for $65/"

  body: "Wow. That must be a really tight budget... the whole set of <em>'<a href=\"http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=212&dw=138\">Alphabet</a>'</em>
    is only $89. That seems pretty reasonable to me, especially if you plan on doing
    future work for that same client.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If the designer licensed the font, then it is his responsibility to hold
    onto it and not give it away to his clients, friends, and other parties. (Unless
    the T-26 EULA has much more permissive terms.)\r\n\r\nIf the client licensed the
    font, then the designer should pass the font back to the client and delete any
    copies he has on his computer(s)."

  body: You have no idea how tight the budget is...my condo just got hit with a 1300.00
    assessement for a new roof...which kind of killed any spare cash I had....I've
    got the Emigre, I'll give it a shot, and it's not a done deal that I'll be doing
    all their stuff yet...

  body: "After some poking around I found the EULA for T-26:\r\nhttp://www.t26.com/about/eula.php\r\n\r\nI'm
    sorry to hear about your roofing woes, dunnyman. But the price of the font(s)
    is the cost of doing business in this case. [Unless you pay for the types you
    use, there is no point in type designers making any new type, etc etc etc blah
    blah blah.]"
