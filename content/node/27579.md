    Busorama Bold</a> is the closest Busorama I could find, but it's still not a match.
    Many of the characters are different, most notably the <cite>H</cite> and <cite>U</cite>.\r\n\r\nEither
    it's been heavily customized or it's different face entirely."

  body: Nah, it's the "classic" pre-digital enhanced version. The alternates never
