  each issue is city-specific. The next issue will be about Reykjav\xEDk, capital
  of Iceland. In each issue I try to use a display face / family produced by a type-designer
  from that city (or at least the country in question) \u2013 something that visually
  represents the area in tone/feel. \r\n\r\nI am trying to get in touch with any type
  designers who live and/or work in the city. Do you know of anyone? Any recommendations
  of places to research this? I've done a bit of digging and found a few names but
  I know this is the place to ask. \r\n\r\nAny help / opinions on Icelandic type in
  general please get in touch on here or via hello@luketonge.com. \r\n\r\nMany thanks! "
