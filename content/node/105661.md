body: I'm designing my first typeface and I'm at the point now where I'm working on
  punctuation, math symbols, etc. The not-so-major stuff that's actually kinda major
  in making a proper functional font. The face is an early 20th century flared serif.
  It's very close stylistically to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/symbol/std-black|ITC
  Symbol Black]] and I noticed in researching Symbol as well as other faces in the
  same vein that there is a difference between the solidus glyphs and the mathematical
  slashes. It looks to me like many of these fonts are using generic math symbols
  that don't match the design of the rest of the font. Maybe I'm overthinking but
  is there some kind standard when it comes to math symbols like the division slash,
  or is it fine to use the same glyph for the solidus and the math slashes?

  body: "Not to put to big a point on it, but how many mathematical users will select
    something like ITC Symbol Black to do <strong>any</strong> work? My guess is the
    number will approach zero...\r\n\r\nHowever, think about it. The mathematical
    slash is used in an equation with other symbols, esp. if you're setting an equation
    in line, such a\r\n\r\n[(1+1) + (17/2)] / (2x2) = 2.625\r\n\r\nThe spacing and
    shape of all the operators should harmonize. Some will set the equation without
    spaces around the operator, some with space, and in some cases, that will be the
    full word space, thought a thin space would be preferable.* Your sidebearings
    need to accommodate all of these, as best possible.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if you're
    using lining figures, there is no reason for the slash to go below the baseline
    (though it should balance with parens & brackets). On the other hand, your solidus
    will go with letters that have a descender, so you can consider using one that
    dips below the baseline.\r\n\r\nEtc. Etc. Form & function may be crippled in these
    modern times, but aren't quite dead yet, esp. amongst the people who actually
    use type. Consider what they need when they use it.\r\n\r\n*Actually, it isn't
    all that uncommon these days to find the space character in a font real close
    to a 5-to-em space, around 200 units. And that's what Unicode calls a \"thin space\"
    (U+2009). If you're going to use such a small word space, 200 to 220 on a 1000
    unit em, your thin and hair spaces should be appropriately smaller.** I use to
    use a 167/1000 for a thin (6-to-em) and 55/1000 for a hair, but sometimes have
    to rethink this, depending on the space value. & thinking on it, a 6-to-em is
    already in Unicode at 2006, but IIRC, not quickly addressable via InDesign.\r\n\r\n**
    Or not. Old Linotype linecaster operators used \"thin space\" to mean an unexpanded
    spaceband wedge, so there is some precedent for setting it to the word space.
    But only as the smallest word space to be used. If you think of the normal 80%-100%-whatever
    that pops up in InDesign's justification panel, a thin would then be 160 with
    a 200 word space. Personally, I don't like this way of approaching a thin, but
    it <cite>is</cite> a personal decision."

  body: "This is definitely a display face I'm working on so I'm sure the mathematical
    glyphs won't be used often, but I've got a bit of a completionist streak in me
    so I want to make sure all of the basics are covered. I will probably ignore anything
    past the commonly-used glyphs (plus, minus, multiply, divide, etc). Your comment
    regarding the differences in baseline made a lot of sense so I think I will do
    the two different slashes, it's not like they are complex glyphs. \r\n\r\nThanks
    for the insight on spacing, too!"
