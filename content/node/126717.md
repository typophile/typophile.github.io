  as \u201CBaskerville\u201D (https://busrasafak.wordpress.com/2015/12/03/font-styles/
  ; https://fontstipografia.wordpress.com/2014/05/25/serif-baskerville/ )\r\nTo me
  it looks sort of a contemporary adaptation of Baskerville, surely light years away
  from all the Baskervilles I know. (ITC, Monotype, Storm etc.) \r\nLook for example
  at the tails of the uppercase Q and R, or at the shape of the serifs in general.\r\nAny
  suggestions would be great.\r\nThanks!\r\nM.\r\n"
