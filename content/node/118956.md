body: "Some would say space before and after a paragraph is a  \"you say tomato, I
  say tomato\" kind of thing. \r\n\r\nI run into situations where we have added space
  before and space after that accumulates and gets very confusing especially when
  one is designing a template of a complex document. \r\n\r\nBullets and numbered
  bullets are the worst. \r\n\r\nGenerally speaking is there a \"proper use\" for
  before spacing and for after spacing? I imagine if only one was needed, only one
  would have been provided.\r\n\r\nJW"

      Framemaker I understand) they all have the same model. \r\n\r\nThere probably
      isn't a \"best practice\". "

  body: I mostly try to use only space after, exactly because it keeps things more
    manageable. But it also depends on its relation with spaces before and/or after
    headings, sub-headings, bullet-list items, and so on...

  body: "One important use of paired space before and after is to maintain perfecting
    text in running texts which include headings and sub-headings as it allows even
    fractional line spacings to be matched so that the first line of the subsequent
    paragraph falls perfectly on the standard text grid.\r\n\r\nYou might for instance
    drop 5 lines of standard text for an A heading - use two of the line spaces for
    the enlarged heading itself with two and half  lines of space above and half a
    line below to ensure that the main text restarts on the grid and the pages of
    running text continue to perfect.\r\n\r\nMaintaining perfecting of running text
    with  a variety of inserted materials and absolute control of proportions of space
    around elements would seem to me to be the primary practical justification for
    this feature."

  body: I typically use space before because that is how I was trained in the days
    of minicomputer typesetting so that's how my mind continues to work. However one
    does it, today it is very important to maintain consistency of use because different
    apps may treat before and after differently. That could really mess up a job if
    for some reason the job was moved between apps and there was a mixture of the
    two ways in the job.
