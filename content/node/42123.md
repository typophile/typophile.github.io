  languages, preferably online, but otherwise is also fine.\r\ni have found a few
  sites, like this: <a href=\"http://www.bckelk.ukfsn.org/words/etaoin.html\">letter
  frequencies (rankings for various languages)</a>. but i'm looking for something
  fairly extensive, perhaps with statistics and definitely Unicode compliant. I've
  also found <a href=\"http://www.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/~dborkman/letter.html\">a tool</a>
  that compiles letter frequencies. has anyone used this or know of a better one that
  might do what i've outlined above? (generate character frequencies, stats, keeping
  Unicode intact) Just thought I'd put a few feelers out there..."

    NSA website]] lists a number of declassified printed documents you might be able
    to request regarding letter or digraph frequencies in Russian, French, Polish,
    and Japanese.\r\n \r\n[[http://codepad.clanhosts.com/index.php?art=frq|This site]]
    has a letter frequency list for English, French, German, and Spanish, and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequencies|Wikipedia]]
    adds Esperanto. And Appendix A of Army field manual 34-40-2, Basic Cryptanalysis,
    has a list of English digraph frequencies. The whole manual is available as a
    zipped collection of PDFs [[http://www.und.nodak.edu/org/crypto/crypto/army.field.manual/fm34402.zip|here]].\r\n\r\n(Later
    edit: I also found [[http://www.nsa.gov/public/Mil_Crypt_I.pdf|this NSA document]]
    (PDF), an introduction to cryptanalysis, that has some interesting information
    on pages 11 through 17. Unfortunately, it's a book that was scanned into PDF,
    and dates back to 1938, so it's not likely to be Unicode friendly -- but it does
    have a claim to being authoritative.) \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: When I lived in DC, a friend of mine worked for the NSA, and their stuff doesn't
    get released for, as has been noted, at least a substantial number of  years after
    it's been collected, so it's probably not all that useful.

    serious Anglicization of most other languages in the world, and that radically
    alters character frequency.\r\n\r\n(Except for France, of course, where they are
    quite rude wrt \"English\" invading \"their\" language. Fold them in with many
    non-Latin languages that are using English words written in their own character
    forms and all bets are off....)"

  body: "I have done some extensive analysis in this field. The texts generated by
    [[http://justanotherfoundry.com/tools/generator|my test text generator]] are synthesized
    on the basis of triplets frequency lists, which I obtained by a very thorough
    analysis of texts.\r\nFor example, for English, as an input I used several texts,
    5 literature, 5 scientific and 2 economic, each 5-10 MB in size. In the end, I
    did not take the arithmetic average but something similar to the median so as
    to make sure subject-specific key words in a certain text do not spoil the overall
    result.\r\nAs you can see, I have data for 22 languages but some of them are only
    based on 4-5 texts.\r\nI could convert my frequency lists to character frequencies
    or pair frequencies if there is a general interest. Btw, why were you interested
    in the first place, Paul? What would you use them for?"

    with non-Latin scripts. The first column of the results it gives seem to me at
    first glance to list glyph occurrences correctly in any Unicode-encoded text.
    It is Mac only, but you could get on one of your roommates' machines\u2026"
