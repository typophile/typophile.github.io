  body: The font I am trying to find is the same as the &#34;sacremento kings&#34;
    font--I answered my own question---it is Narrowband Prime ICG. The font came with
    Illustrator but I don&#39;t know who sells it.

  body: Your assumption that it was Narrowband Prime ICG set  <BR>me on the wrong
    foot. It&#39;s only afterwards I decided  <BR>to check the Narrowband character
    set from up close.  <BR>Sorry I was late. :/
