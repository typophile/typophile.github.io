body: Hello everyone, I&#39;m designing a calendar for the year 2005. Instead of having
  a traditional saints&#39; feast days, like those that can be seen on church calendars,
  I&#39;d like to try having a &#34;patron typographer,&#34; or something like that,
  for each day. Some of these typogragraphers/type designers would have further details/descriptions/portraits/work
  samples/etc., and some would only have their names listed. <BR> <BR>So, who has
  a &#34;patron saint,&#34; whose spirit they try to channel for inspiration? <BR>
  <BR>Conversely, does anyone have &#34;typographic demon,&#34; whose presence occasionally
  needs to be exorcised from your work? <BR> <BR>Dan

    contribution. But he dropped out before the project was finished. <BR> <BR>So
    Johnston Underground had substantial input from Gill, and therefore accusing Gill
    of &#34;ripping it off&#34; seems pretty goofy to me. <BR> <BR>That being said,
    I still have a lot of questions about his personal life that would lead me to
    think twice about considering him a typographic saint. I mean, I have nothing

    extend to one&#39;s family pets and one&#39;s own children. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Well, a year does have 365 days! Just like the Catholic Church&#39;s calendar
    of saints &#40;if that&#39;s what it is really called?&#41; My calendar will have
    saints days on many days &#40;like a third of them, so far&#41;. My list may not
    be long enough! Some saints are paired up on church calendars, too, making the
    list even longer. <BR> <BR>What I don&#39;t want to make is something like Pentagram&#39;s
    2004 calendar. They got 12 designers &#40;living and dead&#41; picked. Each month
    has the days set in a different typeface. In addition to holidays, the 12 type
    designers birthdays are listed. That is a neat promo piece, but I&#39;m not going
    to learn anything new from it. I&#39;d like my calendar to be a bit more encyclopedic.
    <BR> <BR>Since we are on the subject of religion, let me issue a public mea culpa
    here for including GGL on my list!  <BR> <BR>Since this will be my calendar, the
    list sort of follows my interests. I don&#39;t think that I could hurt my own
    feelings  You&#39;ll notice that there are several &#34;Offenbachers&#34; on the
    list &#40;Klingspors, Koch, Hoefer&#41;, since I&#39;m studying there now, and
    am naturally interested on what happend there in the past.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going
    to have to stay steadfast with Gill, though. His work has inspired me for years.
    Although he most certaintly was, in some regards, a shady character, we are only
    speaking about allegations here. He has been dead since 1940, and rumors have
    a funny way of spreading. If you give me definitive legal evidence that he molested
    children, or engaged in rampant beastiality, I&#39;ll take him off my list. Ok?

    pretty well admitted that he did engage in some &#40;mild?&#41; forms of those
    - the evidence is mostly in his own diaries! The &#34;child&#34; was his daughter,
    but it&#39;s not clear to me what a good minimum age is for a consenting adult.
    The dog on the other hand was probably too down-to-earth to have consented, but
    a dog is a dog; you should see what &#34;respectable&#34; people do to cows in
