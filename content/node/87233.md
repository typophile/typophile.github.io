  have no idea what it is and how to get rid of it - i must mention that i identified
  all the fonts stored in my in the settings of my browser and none of them look like
  that. I should also mention that this font is not installed in C/Windows/Fonts so
  i have absolutely no idea from where it has come.\r\nAny idea what it is ?"

  body: "It actually <em>is</em> a system font, used to create the buttons on most
    programs. I don't recall the name\u2014which is MS something\u2014nor is it the
    Windows 7 font folder under that name. Most likely, the name of the default font
    set in Opera is causing the confusion."
