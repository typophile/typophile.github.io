  body: "Do you need the exact font? \r\nFor the formatting all you need is a monospaced
    font at the right point size. Note the width of the space is identical for a very
    narrow letter like i and the widest letters, both upper and lowercase. Note that
    some letters, like m, are compressed to fill the space, while others like r are
    expanded to fill it.\r\nMy fonts has 310 fonts with the monospace tag http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Amonospace/fonts/\r\nQuite
    a few are sans with some similarity to your image.\r\nIf you want an i without
    serifs top or bottom you have  Telegramo http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/volcano/telegramo/\r\nThere
    is also a collection at Dafont http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=503&text=StartTimeEnd%3A&fpp=100\r\nIf
    you want an i without serifs top or bottom you have ElroNet Monospace\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/elronet-monospace.font?fpp=100&text=StartTimeEnd%3A
    and Crystal http://www.dafont.com/crystal.font?fpp=100&text=StartTimeEnd%3A\r\nIf
    you are lucky a font detective will track down an exact match to your image.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
