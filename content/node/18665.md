  all of you for a great looking community.\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a project
  for a organization for the benefit of children and their health.\r\n\r\nI am looking
  for a typeface in order to use in their new identity/wordmark. I was hoping someone
  here could recommend a specific typeface and maybe I can convince them to purchase
  it for the client.\r\n\r\nI was thinking something along a friendly typeface something
  like : The Sans\r\nI was considering using something rounded but I do not want to
  loose the companies serious appeal.\r\n\r\nAll help is aprecaited.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nLukas"
