    can figure out if the numbers are part of a font?

  body: I&#39;m not sure a single font is being used for all of the numbers. The 6,9
    and 2 look like they might be from a geometric like DIN &#40;an older, rougher
    version -- not FF Din&#41;. The 7 doesn&#39;t seem to belong with the others.
