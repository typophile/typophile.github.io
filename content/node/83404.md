body: Are there books that describe languages and include an alphabet of the language?
  I can find plenty of books that tell me where languages are used, who uses them,
  the history, etc., but simple tables of alphabets and orthographies seem to be limited
  to Omniglot and Wikipedia. I have nothing against Omniglot or Wikipedia but I would
  like something that I can browse rather than query.

    even bother showing examples of national and linguistic variations of some scripts.
    Nor does it really show much in the way of variation of Latin and Cyrillic scripts.
    If you\u2019re looking for a basic showing of a full alphabet for alphabetic languages,
    you won\u2019t find it.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s way, way overlong and much too expensive,
    especially considering it does not meet the use case Dunwich has proposed."

    which was issued by the German Reichsdruckerei in 1927. Surely it is not exhaustive
    but it covers an admirable range of alphabets both ancient and modern \u2013 all
    (!) set in lead type. It also contains brief references to treatises on language
    and orthographies respectively.\r\n\r\nAnother source I found quite useful is
    a similar book by Carl Faulmann which has been reprinted and seems to be [[http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=Faulmann&sts=t&x=55&y=12|easily
    to obtain]].\r\n\r\nAnd there is a compendium of lead type alphabets (both ancient
    and modern languages) from the stock of the French Imprimerie Royal (from the
    1990ties). \r\n\r\n"

  body: In terms of what James is seeking, the Faulmann book is probably the closest
    thing, although I would try to cross-check the information for any specific script
    with another source. It was compiled in 1880, so some of the information may be
    out-of-date and, of course, it misses all the languages that adopted or had imposed
    Cyrillic or Latin alphabets during the 20th Century.

    and make a spreadsheet of the alphabet for each, which I could combine with a
    python script to check language support from an list of characters."

    don't have the answer because I am looking for a book format compendium of writing

    author Henry Rogers, 2005, published by Blackwell. The focus is mostly on the
    writing systems and how they are used, rather than languages. It is not very comprehensive
    for tables of all writing systems though.\r\n\r\nHave you seen www.ancientscripts.com?"

    even the old books like Faulmann provide plenty of useful and \u2013 mostly \u2013
    reliable information since their making was closely related to typographic practice.
    On the other hand, when linguists handle the matter of writing systems and alphabets
    this can bear pitfalls for the graphic practitioner.\r\nIn the Faulmann one finds
    also some really rare information about off-the-beaten-track alphabets, e.g for

    and this is the principal problem with <em>The World\u2019s Writing Systems</em>
    from the perspective of a type designer or a typographer. The information it contains
    is not the information that is useful to us. I still admire its attempt to make
    a standard approach to the description of writing systems, given that most linguists
    barely register written language at all."

  body: And in some cases, most specifically Chinese (when written in the traditional
    style), and to some extent Arabic as well, the written form should properly be
    considered as a language in its own right, since the written language, instead
    of being a transcription of current spoken language, is the transcription of an
    older more unified form of the spoken language.

    a rather large brush you're painting with. As an Indo-Europeanist, I can assure

    write my exams in cuneiform), learning quite a bit of epigraphy and paleography

  body: "I am wandering off topic, but the complications of Chinese make generalizing
    difficult.  For example, many of the \"modern\" simplified forms are just short-hand
    versions common for centuries -- some probably pre-date movable type.  Certainly
    classical Chinese is very different from modern (as Latin is from English), but
    modern dialects can be transcribed as easily with traditional characters as simplified
    -- the People's Republic expanded their early computer character set (\"Guobiao\")
    largely by folding in the Taiwanese standard (\"Big-5,\" all traditional).\r\n\r\nSome
    advocate moving Chinese to an alphabetic script to avoid the time spent learning
    and typing thousands of characters.  The first objection is always that written
    characters serve as a bridge between modern dialects that otherwise seem mutually
    unintelligible (such as Cantonese vs. \"Mandarin\").  Even within the most common
    dialect (\u666E\u901A\u8BDD or \"ordinary speech\") characters offer the surest
    way to distinguish among the many homophones; in conversation, it is not unusual
    for one party to \"write\" a character with a finger on his or her palm to clarify
    meaning.  (In modern American English, the meaning of \"POS\" may or may not be
    clear: possibilities include \"point of sale,\" \"parent over shoulder,\" and
    \"piece of sh*t\"; sometimes the meaning is clear from the context, sometimes
    you need to spell it out.)\r\n\r\nThe consequences of technology for \"written\"
    Chinese are staggering.  Before computers, typewriters were simply too complex
    for ordinary use.  But, with text messaging cheaper than voice, China passed a
    billion messages per day years ago, when cell-phone screens and keypads were tiny.
    \ Now smart phones let you input characters by drawing them on-screen.\r\n\r\nIn
    modern Chinese, there is overlap between speech and writing, and between hand-written
    forms and typed.\r\n\r\nDavid"
