  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I came across this posted in the Releases section of the forum and hope I could bring it to General Discussion:

http://typophile.com/node/80630

It's the typeface uniquely designed by Retype for the city of Bath. It was interesting to read one of the comments saying that it looks quite Dutch. I wonder if anyone else here has a shared opinion of this? As perhaps a novice, I can't seem to place why it would look Dutch. Then again the other interesting thing is that Retype are based in the Hague, so maybe there are influences of that?

I welcome all types of discussion on this matter!</div>

That would be De Roos, Crouwel, Kisman, Pool, Verkaart, &c., &c…

It would be more accurate to speak of a certain kind of Dutch type design, informed by the theories and teaching of Gerrit Noordzij (author of <em>The Stroke<em>).

RadioB: Could you elaborate on that? i.e. do you think it's a particular quality that the Bath type family has that reminds you of Lucas de Groot, or is it just "a feeling"?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I wish I could explain it in a more technical or intellectual way but I can't. I guess in bold it just reminds me of Lucas de Groot's typefaces, especially 'the mix', 'the sans' and 'the serif'. I guess you could say it is just a feeling because when you look at them side by side they are clearly different.</div>

<cite>It was interesting to read one of the comments saying that it looks quite Dutch.</cite>

But then someone pointed out that the type of "Dutch" typeface being referred to had, as one of its first representatives, the typeface Quay Sans, previously designed by the same British designer David Quay.

Otherwise, the discussion didn't really define what was being referred to, but it was noted that Dutch typography of late has included a lot of innovative and contemporary type designs.</div>
