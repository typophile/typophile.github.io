    varying sound frequencies! \r\n\r\nSometimes, those black gooey bits almost seem
    to move like they have intent \u2014 (reminds me a little of the Spiderman villain,
    Venom, doesn't it?) Awesome vid, Joe. \r\n\r\n(One critique: I might have wished
    for cooler/ more contextual word formations rather than \"dog\" and \"cat...something
    more fitting to the visceral gunkiness?)"

    the video description). Don't know how he/she got it so black, though. :)
