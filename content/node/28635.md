body: "We've launched v2 of the TypeTrust web site.\r\n\r\nhttp://typetrust.com\r\n\r\nWe've
  had a functional beta online since April, but we wanted to hold off on widespread
  promotion until we were really happy with the web presence.  (A little CSS goes
  a long way.)  We're working on some additional features like RSS and referral tracking,
  and we're still plugging away with the content.  More specimens and downloadable
  PDFs are in the works, so bookmark us or create an account to receive announcements.\r\n\r\nSome
  new fonts are up.  <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/designer.php?did=Nw==\">Chris
  Dickinson</a> has given us two brand new exclusive humanist sans families: <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=MjI1\">Alber</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=MjM0\">Depot</a>.  We've
  got more from <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/designer.php?did=Mw==\">Dino
  dos Santos</a> (DSType).  I've regenerated his new OTFs to group by family -- a
  vital convenience in my opinion.  <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/designer.php?did=OA==\">Ryoichi
  Tsunekawa</a> (Flat-It) has joined and has a lineup of exclusives on the way.  <a
  href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/designer.php?did=Mg==\">Neil</a> teamed up
  with <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/designer.php?did=NA==\">Anuthin Wongsunkakon</a>
  to put the finishing touches on <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=Mjgz\">PennStation</a>...
  an intricate LED style headline.  Neil has also been quite busy.  Several of his
  OTF rereleases are now available.\r\n\r\nFeedback is much appreciated.  Let us know
  what features you'd like to see and whether you stumble over any quirks that need
  fixing.  Just shoot us your 2 cents through our contact form.  Thanks!"

  body: "It's a great design; almost entirely functional, it renders quickly and lets
    the type stand out, with just a little hint of decoration to keep the header from
    looking boring. \r\n\r\nBy the way, Depot is so pretty it hurts to look at. That
    one's going on my list of fonts to buy when I'm not living on student loans!"

  body: "I just got the announcement in my e-mail. Silas, if you regenerated Dino's
    new OTFs to group by family\u2014 did you by chance adjust Musee? I just bought
    it a couple of weeks ago and a family list would be helpful to say the least considering
    how many OT features it has.\r\n\r\nBTW, I love your type and love your site.
    I also love the prices! Very reasonable for us working designers. I will be building
    a library from Type Trust for sure."
