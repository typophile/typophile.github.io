body: "<strong><em>Just a thought.</em></strong> The specialties of typography (such
  as font creation within the creative process, a digital letter) is its sensitivity
  to the originality and mastery of advanced techniques of production of a work of
  fonts. Why is happen? The reason is the thousands and even millions of typographer
  always\" fighting in the battle field\" about \"the appearance of different\" from
  at least 256 classic characters from the Latin letters. Not to mention other forms
  of the more original form of digitalization of the letter in the local language
  (eg local language in the homeland, and the unique characters from other countries
  such as cyrillic, Arabic, Greek and Latin, etc.). Even more interesting that the
  uniqueness of a work of typography also mostly found in the form of a beautiful
  caligraphy which different from each other.\r\n\r\nWhen all the people writing their
  own letter \"a\" here, guaranteed to be different from each other, both in appearance,
  size, thickness and so on. It will also be the same if we say that  the handwriting
  of each person is always different.\r\n\r\nA spontaneous Handwriting, may be we
  categorized the most original works from intuition and the ambidexterity. But all
  of that (very possible) can be changed when the original works entered to digital
  design that will be contact with the the basic rules of typeface. Adjustment of
  the size, density, thickness, height, slope and so on will be done, which also allows
  the shape change from its original form. If by chance -- the output -- there are
  similarities with the work of others. Are they still the original? That is the real
  challenge for the originality. :-)"
