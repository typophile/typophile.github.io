  fast, frequent and irregular eye movements which progresses the eye from one reading
  position to the next. \r\n\r\nSaccades have been recorded at up to 500 degrees per
  second. At this speed, visual input is reduced and no information is processed.\r\n\r\nA
  saccade is proceeded by a [[fixation]] during which information is processed in
  the [[fovea]].\r\n\r\n"
