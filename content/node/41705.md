    and the image is taken off a garment of some description so the text is a probably
    distorted though not sure its VAG rounded. this image may (or may not be!) a little
    clearer.\r\n\r\nthanks again\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/web_logo2_5858.jpg]"

      trouble though, would assume this text has been distorted too, trying to identify

  body: They could be hand drawn graphics, not a font. Or parenthesis.

  body: "thanks for the feedback pattyfab, the parenthesis idea probably isn't too
    far away from the truth, on a quick look through the Harrington brackets aren't
    dissimilar in construction, although i'd say they could have been violently squashed
    as above!\r\nany other opinions welcome.\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n"

  body: Maybe. It's the soft edges that say VAG to me, but it's possible those are
    a result of the print.

    look back at the original squashed mess we were attempting to identify. "

  body: Doesn't the image look as if it is curved as well? Sort of as if the left
    side is further away from the camera? If that is the case the s could be distorted
    and still could be Futura.

  body: "For the s: it's just the side-effect of the blur. The Ampersand speaks clearly,
    so if it's not Futura, it could just be a digital version of one of the many Futura-cousins,
    like Spartan, Super Grotesk or Twentieth Century, with the ascenders and descenders
    of different length.\r\nIt's curious to see how much VAG Rounded shares features
    with Futura\u2026\r\n"
