  body: thanks Florian! I'm guessing this is a custom one then cause it doesn't seem
    to be completely solved-

  body: "The contrast on this N, for example, is backwards from all the contrasted
    sans I have been finding. However, it's just like the narrow serif fonts, like
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/keyboard-rr/|Keyboard]]. It's not exact
    (the G chin is too high, and the S spine is not the same), but it would be a better
    approximation of what appears to be a custom font, if you removed the serifs from
    such a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
