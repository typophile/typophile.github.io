body: "Hi,\r\nWhat do most people do when filling in the 'TrueType Vendor Code' field
  in the 'Basic Font Identification' setting of FontLab.\r\n\r\nShould a one-man foundry
  register with Microsoft or Apple?\r\n(Love to here comments and views from the normal
  Joe and the Microsoft guys on this)\r\n\r\nOr do you, as the manual says,\r\n<em>\"...identify
  yourself without registering you may enter a lowercase four-letter vendor code.\"</em>\r\n\r\nIs
  there a blank default setting, or are you bound to put something....like Pyrus?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\nDrj\r\n"

    locate you at some point in the future. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/vendorlist.aspx
    \r\n\r\nI'd suggest not using the tool default as that seems a bit amateur. If
    you don't want to register an ID I'd suggest leaving it blank."
