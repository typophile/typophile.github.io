  being my first post (although I have been a member for a year) \r\nI have one pertinent
  question to designing a typeface; what are some \r\nessential mathematics a type
  designer should know when constructing \r\na face? I am well aware of the limitless
  optical concerns but I want \r\nto really start digging into the details so please,
  number wonders,\r\nany advice would be wonderful.\r\n"

    of typefaces, this is the most famous historical example. I don't think you're
    going to find any secret formula for designing a typeface, though.

    incorporate ratios into things like kerning, so that they scale proportionately
    in low res rendering.\r\nLuc de Groot developed a formula for the relationship
    between weights, so that it is not linear, but that's not really essential."

  body: 'Whatever numerical rule you discover, you''ll immediately find numerous exceptions.
    Whatever "rational" or logic-based theories you collect or devise for type design
    need to be tested against the real-life application of visual assessment; in other
    words, type is made to be looked at, so the final arbiter of function, beauty,
    or whatever, will be the human eye. Since there is so much about type design that
    requires compromise, deception, trickery and illusion, I think you should focus
    on those aspects. There are examples of alphabets overlaid with intricate geometric
    schemes, but many of those turn out to be applied for teaching purposes after
    the fact; they don''t assist in the production of useful or beautiful letters.
    The Latin alphabet is derived from shapes written by hand. '
