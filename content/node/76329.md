  to a burning question.  Firstly a little background.  The company I work for has
  put me in charge of producing our \"Year Of 2010\" garments, with the names of graduating
  students printed on the back.  We do this on behalf of universities and educational
  institutions all over the place.  The maximum total print size for the artwork is
  A3, so obviously there's an upper limit to the number of names we can fit on, currently
  around 1600.  Sometimes we have a graduating class of between 1600 and 1750, which
  requires the production of two pieces of artwork, and this is a real pain for pretty
  much every stage of the ordering, production and administration process.\r\n\r\nSo
  obviously a way of fitting more names, legibly, on an A3 sheet is a good thing.
  \ The names appear like this:\r\n\r\nJohn Smith ~ Jane Smith ~ Ali Abbas ~ Sue Holness
  ~\r\nJuan de Souza ~ Richard Strauss ~ Ben Jones ~ Kate\r\nHanratty ~ \r\nand so
  on.\r\n\r\nI've so far managed to squeeze more names on by reducing the line spacing,
  replacing the ~ with a narrower character (usually a Middle Dot), and reducing the
  character spacing by 5% when I'm desperate to get those last 20 names on!\r\n\r\nSo
  here's my question - is there a better font for the job that the 8pt Arial we currently
  use?  I don't know the terminology for all the components of a font, but something
  with narrower \"rounded\" (like O, S, C, D, G) characters would be good.  Also bear
  in mind that these are being printed on fabric, so the characters are on a fuzzy
  background rather than shiny white paper.  I've read a few other forum posts about
  fonts that are legible when printed small, but I'm very much on the hunt for a font
  that's defined enough to print well on fabric while being narrow enough to ensure
  the maximum number of characters can appear on a single line.  Can anyone help out?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nHenry"

    you could make the most basic change and use Arial Narrow. It certainly takes
    up less room (in width.)\r\n\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: Hey, that works pretty well, thanks Jason.  The lines that make up the font
    get quite thin though, I'm not sure how that'll fare with the screen printing
    process.  Are there any fonts out there which save room by using less white space
    rather than sacrificing the "boldness" of the lettering?  I'm probably using all
    the wrong terms for each of these things, you lot are probably laughing your heads
    off!

  body: "Sure there are lots of them. But for simplicity's sake, you could try using
    Arial Narrow Bold. \r\n\r\nAlternately, you could try Delicious, a free font which
    I really love. It comes in 3 weights, and they all have the same character widths.
    It should be narrower on average than Arial. You can download it from this page:\r\nhttp://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html\r\n\r\nJason

    on the list, Bell Centennial, is probably as economic as you can get with text."
