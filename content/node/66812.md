body: Hi there! I have been SEARCHING high and low for this font and can't find it
  anywhere! I have it as an embroidery design, but would like to match it in true
  type font so I can use it in my other embroidery program.  If you search for Jack
  and Jill font you only come up with the embroidery font option-not what I need.  I'm
  sure there has to be a match out there somewhere, but I haven't been able to find
  it.  Any help or suggestions?

  body: I think it's likely that this is a custom embroidery, and there's not a match
    out there anywhere.

  body: "I'm inclined to agree, although this sort of look is common enough in scrapbooking
    fonts. I found one free and two commercial fonts that might be close enough to
    use as substitutes, but not if you HAVE to match your sample. The freebie is Pizzadude's
    [[http://www.dafont.com/loveletters.font?nb_ppp=50&text=Isabella|Love Letters]].
    The commercial fonts are [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/sugar-shack/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D37%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DIsabella%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D30|Sugar
    Shack]] by Bob Alonso,and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/amore/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D37%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DIsabella%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D22|Amore]]
    from ParaType.\r\n\r\nIf you study the Love Letters or Sugar Shack fonts, and
    imagine a few changes, like adding serifs, you can see how perhaps this font of
    yours might have been developed as a custom font 'inspired' by one of these others.\r\n\r\n-
