  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So, I'm in the process of redesigning the magazine I work on, which used to be two magazines, but is now just one. Both magazines use a combination of sans serif and serif, mostly used to set sidebars and other info from the running text. So far, these are the faces I've looked at because of their huge set of weights. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FF Scala &amp; Scala Sans (nice, but&hellip;) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FF Zine Sans &amp; Serif (a little wonky) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FF Page Sans &amp; Serif (very nice, but some weird weight shifting in the design) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Previously, one magazine used FF TheSans &amp; TheSerif while the other used Adobe's Celestia Antiqua &amp; Scala Sans. I find FF Thesis a pain in the butt to work with because of the way the weights are set up, bold jumps to small caps, and the way the fonts show up in menus makes it a pain for the editor to work with the text. My editors do most of the text formatting (and there's a lot of it to be done), so FF Thesis is no longer really an option. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm looking for suggestions for humanist sans serifs with a matching serif. I need full families with small caps, etc. since I use all that stuff fairly regularly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Any thoughts?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sean, I wouldn't take suggestions for matching your sans and serif faces. As an art director with any sense of style, that's probably the key creative decision you will make, as the relationship defines the personality of the magazine. You should determine it yourself, based on the way you will use the faces together. And the more unusual and personal a pairing you can make, the more distinctive the personality of your magazine.</div>

The magazine is split between Lord of the Rings type articles and general news, so I wanted the humanist but slick design of Scala Sans for the general news, but the humanist serif of Scala for the LotR style stuff. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But, this brings up another point, what is your favorite &quot;strange&quot; mix of fonts?

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;but surely you can't think that all designers who tackle creating a matching set of fonts have designed in blandness? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No, some make a point of constructing the sans and serif quite differently, eg Fedra. However, there are also quite a few where the serif is just the sans with serifs pasted on. Also, if the point of having sans and serif is to provide contrast in a layout, using a mega family that provides both reduces that effect. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Having said that, I once designed a publication using Gill Sans and Gill Serif (aka Perpetua), and it worked out nicely: Perpetua Titling and the condensed Sans were very useful, and the over-the-top Gill Sans Ultra Bold, surrounded by total Gillosity, wasn't too bizarre at all. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, who did design Gill Sans Ultra Bold, surely not Eric&hellip;? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;what is your favorite &quot;strange&quot; mix of fonts? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I used Meta for Heads and sidebars, and Paradigm for main text, when I redesigned Cycle Canada in 1996.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Years later, but for the record, another voice on the question of Gill&rsquo;s involvement in Gill Sans Ultra Bold: Albert Sperisen defended Gill from the criticism in Robert Harling&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Letter Forms and Type Designs of Eric Gill<!-- raw HTML omitted --> like this:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->… Again, without proper checking, Harling gets a bit rough when he speaks of Gill’s “peccadilloes” in his “horrendous and blackguardly… display exploitations” of Gill Sans, the fat version known as Gill Sans Ultra Bold. The less said about this unfortunate version the better, but the fact remains that this “adaptation” was made by an apprentice under Gill’s supervision, a practice for all things made in the Gill workshop. (The source for this latter statement is a recent interview with one of Gill’s apprentices.) Gill accepted this commission from the Monotype works under duress. He put off doing anything about it for too long, until repeated demands produced what Gill labeled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sans-Elefans<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a tongue-in-cheek title for a publicity letter in which Gill had no interest. This crass commercialism on the part of Monotype was no different from that of other type foundries when they “created” from overly popular typefaces, and almost all of those variations were the product of foundry “art departments.” Too, if the criticism of Gill is valid, it must be remembered that Stanley Morison was in charge at Monotype!

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think Gill Sans is too &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; (typographic colour), even in the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; weight, for running body text. But that&rsquo;s just my humble opinion. I&rsquo;m trying myself to match a sans serif with other sans serif for a magazine&hellip;which typefaces match (for titles) with Scala Sans for running text?</p>
<p>Gill Sans is a nice and elegant typeface, but I don&rsquo;t like its &ldquo;typographic colour&rdquo; for running text&hellip;</p>
