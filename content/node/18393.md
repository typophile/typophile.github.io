  to answer =)\r\nI have seen this internetsite once where you could enter what you
  are looking for in a typeface and then it gave you a couple of matches. You could
  search by mood, serif, style, etc.\r\n\r\nWould anybody plz be able to tell me what
  that site was, I've been looking for a couple of days now, but apperently at all
  the wrong places, just can't find it anymore.\r\n\r\ntnx people!\r\ndav."

    if you have an account with them.

    body: "thank you very much, works like a charm indeed!\r\n\r\nI have just one
      other little question which might sound a bit strange..but is there a famous
      type family that is made to look like another one, but slightly different? (I
      know it's a strange question, but I need to typographically show the sentence:
      'but he wants to be just like', so I thought I use a type with a underlying
      thought that can be logically explained).\r\n\r\n\r\nNone are so hopelessly
      enslaved as those who falsely believe they are free.\r\n-Goethe-"

    Helvetica > Arial springs to mind. Did you have anything specific in mind?"

  body: "Not really. Maybe it will help if I explain what I am working on. I'm making
    a book about Vincent (the poem by tim burton). This poem is so dynamic, going
    from sad to happy, cheerful to insane, young boy to old man, etc. that I thought
    that it would be nice to try and translate the story typographically. So I split
    the poem up in sentences and took 1 letter from every sentence and made it a lot
    bigger then the rest. The letter will be used to communicate the feeling of that
    particular part of the poem. So on every page I'm using bodoni as the text with
    one letter in the typeface best communicating the mood and everything arranged
    according to a grid around that letter to even more express the mood.\r\n\r\nSo
    in this case anything will be good really as long as it's a type that has a well
    known history since on the left side of the page next to the poem I will give
    a very brief history of the type used and a little bit about why I used that type
    to express that mood.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping that with this book I can playfully teach
    the reader a little bit about different typefaces and how they can be used for
    communication purposes.\r\n\r\nSo I'll do a little reading into helvetica vs arial
    (I think these are quite good because everybody uses them so much they should
    have a place in the book as well, I think). =)\r\n\r\nThank you very much!!!\r\n\r\nNone
