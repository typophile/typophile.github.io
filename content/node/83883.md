    Compressed]] or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/bold-condensed/|Akzidenz
    Grotesk Bold Compressed]] could be okay starting references, but neither is quite
    right.\r\n\r\nI suspect the distressed look has been added afterwards and is not
    part of any digital font file."
