  GREAT community.\r\n\r\nThis is an identity I have been working on for a record
  label\r\n\r\nWhile this is my first attempt at an entirely custom typeface/logotype,
  and I'm definitely happy with it, I also want it to be better (if it can be). Any
  thoughts/feedback you have would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nthe font is custom.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n<img

    like the angle of the crossbar of the e/a though. I think that helps the a."

  body: I like Nick Job's idea of two e's, partly because the word "speak" is spoken
    like "speek". The typeface could benefit from a bit more spacing, I think, because
    the counter on p seems overwhelming

  body: "You need latest shockwave flash player to upload images. There was a thread
    about this - do a search.\r\n\r\nI thought the 'e' would look good rotated to
    form the 'a' but I prefer the angle of the crossbar (i.e. not horizontal) in YOUR
    original. I think that the non-horizontal angle makes the 'a' look more like an
    'a'. My version looks more like a rotated 'e', not an 'a'.\r\n\r\nI hope this
    clarifies."

  body: "\r\nthanks NickJob, if I remember correctly the 'a' did start its life as
    an almost immediate rotated form of the e, but along a similar train of thought
    the word lost some readability, and so the letterform was adjusted to read more
    clearly - arriving at what is shown in the logo.\r\n\r\n\r\n<label><a href=\"http://www.solid-creative.com\">Communication

  body: "I think you could bring the diagonal of the s to more horizontal and make
    it slightly wider. The k seems out of step with the other characters, you could
    maybe look at the leg to introduce some of the angularity. You could also try
    more variation in the line widths, especially at junctions I am thinking particularly
    of the upper junction of the p and the top junction of the a. I am left wondering
    why the top of the a doesn't join to the e, the a also seems a bit cramped in
    the top right storey. The bubble and type don't seem visually centred, it needs
    to be moved right slightly.\r\nTim"

  body: "I think it looks a little bit claustrophobic, so perhaps draw it with \r\na
    touch more space between the characters. The 's' seems to be \r\nfalling to the
    left, so try extending the bottom stroke on the 's' to \r\nthe left a whisker.
    \r\n\r\nReducing the descender on the 'p' and the ascender on the 'k' may \r\nhelp
    alleviate some of that claustrophobic feeling aswell.   \r\n\r\nPhil"
