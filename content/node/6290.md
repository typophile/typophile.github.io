  body: Hmmm... Haven&#39;t got an exact match, but I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve
    already checked stuff like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/compacta/">
    Compacta</a> or <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_050.jhtml"> Helvetica
    Compressed</a>. Those are the most obvious of course, there are quite a few more.

    this</a> is a real knock-out.

  body: You&#39;d better be. This is the raw expression or rock&#39;n&#39;roll unchained.
    Imagine this very sight times four, accompanied by ripping guitar riffs, a thumping
    bass and thunderous drum rolls. Wickid!

  body: Looks like any ol generic Gothic Condensed woodtype junk to me. And I&#39;d
    guess original. Not often easy to identify specifically as many of the specimens
    from the various 19th c. American manufacturers were destroyed as Hamilton took
    them over. But I&#39;d assume this was printed in England?
