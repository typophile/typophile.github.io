body: ' Hi, I need to calculate the length of an english text once it has been translated
  into spanish. I know there is a percentage &#40;&#43;10% ?&#41;, but I can&#39;t
  remember it. The inverse percentage &#40;spanish into english&#41;, should also
  be usefull. Thanks '

  body: ' It depends on different things, like the nature of the text, and the expertise
    of the translator. <BR> <BR>According to Maxim Zhukov&#39;s &#34;Typographica
    Polyglotta&#34;, Spanish is about 15% longer then English, assuming a squeaky-clean
    translation. A very good translator recently made a Spanish version of a 2,500-word
    essay of mine, and he ended up with an impressive 14%. <BR> <BR>Whether such percentages
    are symmetric is a question I haven&#39;t figured out yet. <BR> <BR>hhp '
