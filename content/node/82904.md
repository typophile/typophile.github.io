body: "Hi there - wondering if I could get some help ID-ing these two fonts in this
  attached logo. I received a quick turn around project, and would like to use the
  same fonts in their advertising message... however, their logo was developed over
  6 yrs ago, and no one can find the font. The first part looks similar to a modified
  Trajan bold....? Any input would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nCheers -"
