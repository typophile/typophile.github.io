  classics, so I&#39;m reading up on Tschichold&#39;s work and Geoffrey Dowding&#39;s
  &#34;Finer Points&#34;.  I was wondering: does anyone here use the ampersand in
  body text to improve spacing and lines, and if so, when, where and why? <BR> <BR>Many

    example I know of &#40;there must be more though&#41; is Eric Gill&#39;s heavy
    use of the ampersand in his wonderful &#34;Essay on Typography&#34; - although
    I don&#39;t know if it was for spacing, color, or what. <BR> <BR>I myself use
    the ampersand, but very rarely in formal text, basically for things like &#34;cut
    &amp; paste&#34;, or sometimes to group things in a complex sentence, like this:
    &#34;... for which Perrin drew, and had engraved &amp; cast his Augustaux capitals.&#34;

  body: I&#39;m pretty sure Gill&#39;s use of the ampersand was for better spacing
    &#40;and even rag&#41;. Likewise his use of <i>tho&#39;</i> vs. <i>though</i>.
    When I used to do some hand-setting, I used to use them for better spacing.  <BR>
    <BR>I guess I still use them to varying degrees, depending on what face I&#39;m
    using. Tho&#39; with the advent of glyph scaling in InDesign, and paragraph-level
    composers, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s hardly necesarry.

  body: It is considered improper grammar &#40;if that matters to you&#41; to use
    the ampersand in text.  Somehow this character has, at least in publishing circles,
    been relegated to things such as logos or, in the rare case that one does see
    an ampersand in text, things like &#34;B&amp;B&#34;, where &#34;B and B&#34; just
    doesn&#39;t look right &#40;of course, respectable editors and English professors
    will argue that you shouldn&#39;t be writing &#34;B&amp;B&#34; in the first place--it
    ought to be &#34;bed and breakfast&#34;.&#41;

  body: Fine book work my arse. Book are meant to be read. Splitting &#39;Five&#39;
    and &#39;hundred copies&#39; like this is just a barrier to understanding, and
    neither of the two uses of an ampersand in this dog&#39;s breakfast can be justified
    grammatically. Does anyone really still believe that typographic masturbation
    like this is fit work for a grown man? <BR> <BR>Back in the real world, those
    of us for whom legibility and ease of use is of rather more concern know that
    ampersands should never be used as a substitute for &#39;and&#39; in the run of
    text &#40;or, for that matter, headlines&#41;, except where they form part of
    an organisation&#39;s name &#40;ie Marks &amp; Spencer, P&amp;O&#41; or an accepted
    abbreviation &#40;like &#39;b&amp;b&#39;&#41;.  <BR> <BR>What may have been acceptable
    common practice in Eric Gill&#39;s day &#40;putting full points between initials,
    using &#39;tho&#39; for &#39;though&#39;, overenthusiastic dog-worrying&#41; isn&#39;t

    this is perhaps a nit-picky and non-productive comment, but I wouldn&#39;t say
    that an ampersand is poor <i>grammar</i> so much as poor <i>usage</i>. Or at least
    non-standard usage. It&#39;s not the use of the word &#34;and&#34; that&#39;s
    in question in any of these instances -- it&#39;s how you write it.

  body: I think ... erm ... let&#39;s not forget that the ampersand was originally
    the &#34;et&#34; ligature and was used all of the time even before &#34;type&#34;
    came to be. I&#39;m not sure I agree with the use of the phrase grammatically
    correct. Perhaps typographically correct would be better, but even then ... Well,
    the ampersand as we know it today comes in all beautiful varieties and not only
    in the curvy and curly variety. Perhaps more type designers, now that opentype
    gives us gazillion character options, should give us an &#34;et&#34; that is a
    little more transparent so we can use it once again in long settings of text.

    modern typesetting has changed many rules than were in play before the second

    for use in normal, boring body text. <BR> <BR>I think that Gerald&#39;s use of

    making for a quicker &#39;hit&#39;. Also, this technique has, in my opinion, been
