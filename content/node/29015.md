  body: "Pieter, \r\n\r\nplease note that your code will only work in applications
    that support contextual OpenType substitutions. For example TextEdit, Apple Keynote
    and Apple Pages on Mac OS X 10.4 support ligature substitutions but not contextual
    substitutions. \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Hello. Contextually, you cannot substitute two glyphs at once. So, instead
    of\r\n\r\n<cite>sub f' f' @prob by f.salt f.salt2;</cite>\r\n\r\nyou need to do
    it in two steps:\r\n\r\n<cite>sub f' f @prob by f.salt;</cite>\r\n<cite>sub f.salt
    f' @prob by f.salt2;</cite>\r\n  \r\nNote that in the context defined in the second
    line, the first f already has been substituted by f.salt!\r\n\r\nYou can read
    Adam's note as: You can use contextual substitutions in liga, but keep in mind
    that then some applications may ignore either the lookup containing contextual
    substitution, or at worst, the entire liga feature. (I think the second is true
    for Apple's applications.)\r\n\r\nIf I look at your examples, it seems more appropriate
    to put them into calt which is on by default in some applications, just as liga.\r\n\r\nKarsten\r\n\r\nP.S.
    in bold ...\r\n<strong>As to Apple's applications (and XPress too), it would be
    nice if future versions were less restrictive as regards allowed lookup types
    in specific features!</strong>"

    body: "OpenType spec, actually, allows this kind of substitution. It is current
      OpenType layout compilers/editors that don't support this. \r\n\r\nYou should
      use lower level tools like ttoasm or TTX to do that, but at the price of turning
      whole project maintenance into nightmare. It is practically like programming
      all lookups in assembler.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey\r\n"
