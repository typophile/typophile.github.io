body: i&#39;m working on a stationery system using scala sans for the information
  and am wondering wether lining or non-lining figures are more appropriate &#40;or
  if there is even a consensus&#41;. it&#39;s not really running text, so i can see
  it going either way. personally i&#39;m enamored with the classical nod of the old-style
  figures. any thoughts or previous experiences?

    figures look better when you stack a phone number and a fax number. <BR> <BR>I
    believe Scala Sans old style figures are proportional, so perhaps not a good choice.

    that someone did before I was around this place. Many of the old packages have
    old style figures.  <BR> <BR>I really like old style figures, but every time I
    redo a card and change the numerals to lining, someone says &#34;that looks so
    much better.&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll have to agree with them. As a <i>general</i>
    rule, I believe that lining numerals are better for stationery systems. In this
    context, they are more readable for those with poor vision. And as Nick said,
    they do look cleaner when stacked. <BR> <BR>But there is always the exception.

  body: Imo, OSF is the way to go in stationery design, if the font allows for it.
    They simply visually fit in better with miuscle letterforms and make for a more
    lively reading. In tables, of course, lining &#40;or better still monospaced tabular&#41;
    figures are what you need, but in brochures, books, stationery and anything that
    adheres to the general rules of what makes reading text easier, OSF is nicer.
    Also, to me, it looks more professional, not as run-of-the-mill... OSF are anything
    but old-stlye, I think. Actually, I much prefer them to the lining figures that
    came up during the 70s and 80s,when you even had lining figures on Renaissance
    fonts like Garamond and the like, which clearly need OSFs. :-D. <BR>

  body: But stationery isn&#39;t supposed to be a &#34;lively read&#34;, it is supposed
    to be informative. Within a setting of paragraphs it makes sense to do the OsF
    figures, but within a 2-3 line setting, especially when it isn&#39;t even a sentence,
    but bits of information. <BR> <BR>What do you mean by OsF are anything but Old-style?
    That is exactly what OSF stands for.

  body: Ok. I have to agree with you about the small caps usage. If you do use small
    caps, then you should probably use the OsF because the do fall in line beside
    the small caps much better than to the lining. Thank you for clarifying that.
    However, I do still standby my statement of stationery being design more of the
    information variety. Too much OsF, IMO, is a bad thing in a stationery system.

  body: I&#39;m a sucker for OSFs. There is a certain sophistication to them, and
    it&#39;s one of the tell-tale signs of whether something is professionally set
    &#40;this sounds really superficial, just generally speaking&#41;. When I was
    in high school designing newsletters and magazines, I so much wanted expert sets
    so I could be more of a typographer rather than a desktop publisher! <BR> <BR>Though
    OSFs can look terribly fuzzy for certain things. Like for general word-processing
    tasks like an invoice or letter, I tend to stay away from OSF even when I&#39;m
    using a typeface that has them - ITC Charter, more often than not. Charter&#39;s
    lining numerals are beautiful though. Georgia is a very nice general purpose font,
    but the lack of lining numerals would be very problematic for people like accountants.
    <BR> <BR>How about &#39;short&#39; lining numerals? For example in Bell? Or Miller?
    They don&#39;t jump out at you in continuous text, and look &#39;lively&#39; enough
    to be interesting. I would be happy to do without OSFs for these typefaces. <BR>
    <BR>How about lining old-style figures? They line up in neat columns and jump
    up and down. A nice addition, I think. Many of Adobe&#39;s Pro fonts have them.
    <BR> <BR>I think for people like me who don&#39;t like numbers, OSFs are more
    pleasant to read. At least they don&#39;t look so monotonous. And I tend to think
    that they even help me read them better &#40;shape recognition, just like caps
    vs lowercase&#41;. <BR> <BR>For me, definitely OSFs on business cards. But how
    about ISBN numbers and such? <BR> <BR>Have you noticed certain designers/firms
    don&#39;t use OSFs at all? Like Massimo Vignelli, and Pentagram. They are trying
    to be &#39;modern&#39;?! OSFs are also rarely seen in magazines, and definitely
    not newspapers. And not to mention cheap novels &#40;they probably just don&#39;t
    know better/couldn&#39;t be bothered&#41;.

  body: 'I&#39;ve only seen &#34;lining numerals&#34; to mean where the numbers are
    the same height. Usually this means the same height of the caps as well, but not
    always: there are short lining numerals &#40;pioneered by Austin/Bell&#41;, and
    I think they generally work better. Lining numerals are often fixed-width. <BR>
    <BR>The &#34;opposite&#34; of lining numerals are old-style numerals &#40;which
    are called all kinds of funny things, like &#34;up-and-down numerals&#34;&#41;,
    and they generally behave like lc letters, but not always: there&#39;s what&#39;s
    called &#34;hybrid&#34; numerals, which have larger-than-x=height bodies, but
    also feature extenders. The foremost practitioner of this style is Luc[as] de
    Groot, although happily this style -which I consider the ideal for text- is getting
    quickly more popular. There are actually tentative traces of this in some ATF
    fonts &#40;like Garamond&#41;, but Luc[as] was the first to really flourish the
    hybrid style, as far as I&#39;ve found. <BR> <BR>Old-style numerals are rarely

    <BR>The reasoning behind the circles is very very nice, in my opinion. I can see

    a personal touch, but rather fakes the illusion of personality in an industrial
    fashion... that is kinda the opposite of what you want to express, thus my comment.
    Maybe it is still possible to at least work a bit on the individual letterforms

    too much...? <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think the f is too much of a problem. Maybe
    it helps to make the p and f bold, to better differntiate them from the numbers?
    Or you use Small Caps for these two letters, so they make an ideal fit with the

    SC.  <BR> <BR>One more thing -- I&#39;m not suire how this is done in the US but

  body: '&#62;<i>it&#39;s all about the give and take... </i> <BR>I totally agree
    - and in this case, I think it is worth the compromise. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>&#34;Heartland&#34;:
    just change one of the &#34;a&#34;s. </i> <BR>A great suggestion that will add
    just the right amount of character without too much effort. I like this idea.
    Good one. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>Maybe it helps to make the p and f bold, to better
    differentiate them from the numbers?</i> <BR> <BR>I think that would only highlight
    the issue even more. The problem, to me, is that the &#39;p&#39;  matches too
    much and the &#39;f&#39; does not match enough. I personally try to avoid bold
    whenever I can and try to seek alternate solutions.  <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>Or you use
    Small Caps for these two letters</i> <BR> <BR>Now, this might just be the number
    and is a great excuse not to bold. I am speculating here, I have not tried it,
    but I&#39;ll bet that small caps will be different enough and at the same time
    not match enough to work just right. Give and take. Try it. I&#39;ll bet it will
    work. <BR> <BR>Oh, and I totally agree with Keith that the extension number is
    way out place there. I can not stress enough how much you should move that. I
    say totally leave it off if you can get away with it. If you absolutly need it,
    move it. It needs to be by the phone number. <BR> <BR>I like the sans version.
    It contrasts well with the rest of the card. I do like it. Good night, from the
    desert. <BR> <BR>Sean Michael'
