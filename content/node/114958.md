  body: "The letters are in an old style called stovepipe. FAIK They are not a font
    as such. I can offer several fonts that generally match the letterforms shown
    in the image --_A_ with apex top,  _R_ with vertical leg, _S_ with horizontal
    center stroke.\r\nValuco http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aesthetic-apparatus/valuco/\r\nGaz

    are quite a few that that match the _R_ but not the _S_ and vice versa. Run through
    the stovepipe tag at Myfonts http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Agaspipe/fonts/
    and you will see what I mean.\r\nAll are wider than your letters, although Iwan
    Reschnie is closer in width than the others.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In my opinion of all the fonts mentioned so far, the closest matches  might
    be Deerfield and Matthan Sans. It has _A_ with apex top, _R_ with vertical leg,
    _S_ with horizontal center stroke, and the a similar 7. Matthan Sans is little
    more rounded than your image, but you seem to like the rounded aspect.\r\nDon\r\n"
