  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello!

I'm a graphic design student; I've worked on numerous projects, but I'm still very far from good enough. Therefore, I'd really like you to take the time and look through my portfolio - http://geminianum.carbonmade.com/ - making a few comments, choosing best/worst from it, etc. It'll help me a lot. :)

Thanks in advance, 
Cheers!

		<div class="commentbody">Suggestions.

1. Find at least one font that stands out and has some personality. And then use it. Your fonts are very plain.

2. Work on you grids. Tighten the positive spaces and open up some of the negative spaces. And be more "geometrical".

3. Think about content. Many of your designs are not bad, but nothing reaches out and grabs. There is a plain-ness to most of your work.

That said, I would guess thatyou could greatly improve your work by looking to other designers for inspiration.

Who inspires you?</div>

I can see the plain-ness you're talking about... I really am looking around for inspiration, everytime I have to design something.. But I guess it's just a matter of practice and experience, to get a good result. 

I like modernist work like Vignelli, but really prefer David Carson, Sagmeister and similar postmodern designers.

		<div class="commentbody">The magazine layout stuff is probably the most professional-looking.

The "Dani Sira 2009" is a nice layout, if a bit unpolished with the large font being totally inappropriate.

The Benbello identity is not terrible and you could probably keep that in to fill out the future portfolio.

As for the stand-alone artwork, I would leave that out.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks! I agree with "Dani sira" being bad typographically. :)
Do you find the "clarke2006" poster all bad, or is it just the typography?
I love typography and admire new typefaces, but I'm a student and it's impossible for me to buy them just yet...</div>

A year has passed, I did some new work - hopefully something better, so if you can find the time to look at the designs on [[http://geminianum.posterous.com]] and comment on the pieces, I'd be really grateful. I'm near the end of my collage so I have to decide what to keep in my portfolio and what to throw out... ;)

I would explore ways of creating a bit more tension with some energetic grids. Right now, things seem to be floating a bit too loosely in most of your compositions. Sometimes that is appropriate. But whenever you've got type, it's usually good to be tight with it and establish clear hierarchies and spatial relationships. Or at least suggest a reasoning behind why things are placed where they are.</div>
