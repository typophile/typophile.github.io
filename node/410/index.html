		<div class="commentbody">Sarah. Others will hopefully respond, but in my opinion I don't think it necessarily ends with a degree. It might begin with a solid portfolio, but I think it also includes an internship at a foundry. Have you attempted to contact any type design studios in your area? Font Bureau is in Boston. They might use interns. I also know that at one time The Hoefler Foundry used interns, they are in New York City.  <BR> <BR>At an internship level they probably aren't looking at your lettering or type skills so much as your sincere desire to learn, and also your design portfolio. You might not get to design any type while on your internship, but you can see the inner-workings of a studio. Which in and of itself could be very useful. It would give you a good jumping off point as well.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry, it's late and I just got back from a wedding. <BR> <BR>Internships, or even entry-level design positions, at most design studios will depend slightly on your degree and examples in your portfolio but mostly on how you present yourself, as Tiffany says (kind of).  <BR> <BR>&hellip;although, the few times that I've been sent out to Senior shows to hire people, I was asked by the higher-ups to find people who did work that was exactly the kind of stuff we needed. <BR> <BR>That company went under.

		<div class="commentbody">Sarah &ndash; <BR> <BR>If you're serious about type design as a career, with a <i>bona fide</i> foundry and all &ndash; as opposed to just hanging out with the rest of us posers here ;-) &ndash; then I would echo what Tiffany said.  <BR> <BR>An internship would be a good way to get your foot in the door and some reputable experience under your belt. While you're still fresh out of college and able to move around and live off relatively little, that's the best time to take advantage of this sort of thing. Font Bureau does take interns; I think they usually recruit out of the classes at Yale or RISD, but I'm sure that's not a prerequisite. If you're serious, call them up and ask Harry if they have any openings and what they look for. <BR> <BR>Jonathan Hoefler has been known to take interns &ndash; just ask Jared. I think Bitstream might also, but that's just a guess. Then there's always P22; I think Richard Kegler welcomes interns occasionally, and he's a little closer to you, I think. <BR> <BR>If you can get yourself over to <a href="http://www.typecon2003.com" target="_blank"> TypeCon</a> in Minneapolis next month, you can meet a lot of folks who do the type thing in all different ways and maybe get a better idea of what kind of approach might work best for you. I highly recommend it &ndash; the registration fee can't be beat and a good time is always had by all. <BR> <BR>&ndash; Kent. <BR> <BR></div>
