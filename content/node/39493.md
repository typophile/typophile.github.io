  the font attached.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what that is or can you suggest me any
  *preferably* free fonts that match this font style (not necessarily exactly the
  same). I am looking for the handwritten script style font and specifically the joined
  up style of the J and all subsequent letters in the attached picture.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks to any of you who can help contribute. \r\n\r\nDavid[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jones_logo_3579.png]"
