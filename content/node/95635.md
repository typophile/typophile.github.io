    Grif\uFB01th Gothic, to name but two.\r\nAlso a FF whose name escapes me.\r\nIf
    you go this route, I suggest you make the effect symmetrical, that will simplify
    and strengthen it, make it more fundamental to the design.\r\nTry some dif\uFB01cult
    letters (s, g) and diagonals to further test viability."

    to provide visual interest in display weights of Walburn and Worldwide, c.1998.

    sense, because he was into technological \"compensation\".\r\n\r\nI'd certainly
    be interested in learning about older examples... and the <em>oldest</em> example.
    I love traps! BTW in many cases it's difficult to be sure they were stylistic
    (some of them could be just unusually/unnecessarily large traps) and to me such
    cases can't count. In Bradlo, there can be no doubt.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "To me, Bell Centennial Bold Listing, though it's inktraps are there for real
    practical purposes, is by far the earliest font to take the obvious-inktrap approach.
    Bell Centennial is the grandaddy of these ideas.  It's also interesting that Carter
    drew it out on graph paper, and someone else created the chirography.  So I would
    say the later had a lot more control over the final inktrap lines than Carter.
    \ It's just hard to imagine that Carter didn't hand in a somehow rougher version
    then what was finally published. That's just how designing on graph paper tends
    to pan out.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/qab_5018.png]"

    drew bitmaps because that's what that particular phone book typesetting system
    used. It was only later that outlines were \"wrapped around\" the bitmaps.\r\n\r\nOnce
    the design became scalable people naturally had fun making the trapping not only
    obvious, but the only real reason to use the font.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>someone
    else created the chirography</blockquote>\r\n\r\nEasy, easy. Wrapping outlines
    around bitmaps is at least twice removed from chirography. Probably thrice.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Are you saying that the bitmaps Carter drew were directly inputed into the
    machines that printed the phone books?  I would certainly believe that is possible,
    my knowledge of  40 year old telephone book printers is sorely lacking. However,
    my understanding is that someone had to translate Carter's graph drawings into
    'bezier curve data' for lack of a better term, before it was ever printed.  Could
    be wrong though. I've been wrong thousands of times.

  body: "<blockquote>Are you saying that the bitmaps Carter drew were directly inputed

    the machine that *printed* the phone book, but directly encoded as bitmap data
    for the machine which was destined to typeset the phone book after the conversion
    \u2014 the Linotron 606. (The printing was done by web offset, of course.)\r\n\r\nThe
    Linotron 606 was an early digital typesetter, but this was before the widespread
    use of bezier curves or scalable outlines for letter-shape description. I believe
    the 606 data was stored in run-length encoding and output in scan lines, but don\u2019t
    quote me on that. The Postscript format wouldn\u2019t be made public for another
    couple decades.\r\n\r\nThere were actually film friskets cut for the Bell Centennial
    letters to run early tests on standard VIP phototypesetters. And though Carter
    probably didn\u2019t cut all the friskets himself, he would still have had a close
    hand in defining those outlines, as well as the eventual bitmaps."

  body: "BTW, Richard Southall's fabulous \"Printer's type in the twentieth century\"
    includes a couple of passages about Bell Centennial. Kent is right about the Linotron
    606, and the fact that the data was not binary bitmap data but raster line start/stop
    instructions. The only twist is that those raster lines were actually <em>vertical</em>;
    that might have actually been for reasons of economy, since [Latin] letterforms
    have more/thicker vertical stems than horizontal bars - you end up needing fewer
    start/stop instructions.\r\n\r\nSouthall also mentions a 1982 monograph by the
    Cooper Union titled \"Matthew Carter: Bell Centennial\".\r\n\r\nMargaret Re's
    \"The Art of Matthew Carter\", and her recent Baseline magazine articles probably
    shed more light on this.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I usually start with a bold weight.  Its my favorite weight anyway, and also
    everything is pretty much as exaggerated as it's gonna get (unless there is a
    bolder weight in the family, like Ultra or something,) so for me it's easier to
    dial in the details, because they are more obvious.

    tend to agree with you there though maybe it's only tangential to my point. \r\n\r\nWhat
    I meant was, until the smallest native spaces are determined, where native means
    those that are there before any ink has gotten trapped, what's the point of designing
    ink traps. Show me the \"f\",\"i\" and \"g\"\"!\r\n\r\nNS \"Heavy weight is far

    weight, large x-height\r\n\r\nThe issue I \uFB01nd with heavy weights is that
    it\u2019s not just a question of squeezing things in, with limited options, but
    there is considerable leeway in the width of characters such as /c and /w.\r\n"
