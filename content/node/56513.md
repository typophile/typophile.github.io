  is not installed on my machine. What font can I use that would be closest to Futura?
  Options I'm considering include Century Gothic (Bold), Calibri, or Tahoma.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for helping a newbie out!"

  body: Century Gothic may probably get you as close as it gets to Futura, with pre-installed
    MS/Windows fonts.

  body: "Century Gothic is a bit closer than Avant Garde, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nMore
    broadly, though, I'd think twice about using any font that looks like Futura for
    email, since I don't think any of them will be properly hinted for small sizes
    on screen.\r\n\r\nP J L"

  body: Thanks for the comments. I like how Century Gothic looks in boldface, but
    I'm not so into the regular weight. The question mark is especially problematic.
