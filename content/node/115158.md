body: This letter A (in 'escaped') is so lovely. I was thinking it might be a Caslon
  typeface of some sort, but I haven't been able to find anything similar. Any help
  would be much appreciated. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0394_3967.JPG]

    expand demi-bold to get a passable match.\r\nDon"

  body: "AFAIK metal Ronaldson did not have a black weight. But its dramatic swooping
    serifs were a big influence on type design. ITC Tiffany is only a recent example.
    Since this is a US headline, there might be something in Matt McGrew's book.\r\nDon"
