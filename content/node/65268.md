  body: Could also have been drawn from scratch. Frankly I don't see a too-striking
    resemblance with Arial (check the curve/spine of the "S").

  body: "Thanks for the feedback. I suspected it was hand-drawn but thought it might
    be an obscure font someone knew.\r\n\r\n@ Nick & riccard0 - in the actual logo
    the characters are all overlapping! I just grabbed the first five and put some
    space between them to submit to identifont.\r\n\r\n'They' don't know - these are
    2 good old 'blokes' who build stuff.\r\n\r\nThanks again."
