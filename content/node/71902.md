    like that, with the top line first, curving back to close the counter? I don''t

  body: "I doubt if this is a font. The 'm' is the only repeated letter and it seems
    identical, but it might have been copied from the first m, or drawn by someone
    good enough to make them seem identical.\r\n\r\nThe connected casual quality reminded
    me of Emmascript by Mark Von Bronkhorst, but it is not really similar in the letterforms.\r\n\r\n-
