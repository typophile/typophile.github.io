  does anybody knows good references? I would like to know font suggestions too. I've
  noticed, at least here in my country, that many books of this kind uses fonts like
  Garamond set in 12pt or more, and I would like to avoid this.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n"

    can give you these tips.\r\n1.- use a one-column layout. kids gets losed in multiple
    columns...\r\n2.- use a geometric font (i like Futura, have a lot of weights).
    why geometric?, becouse the 'a' and 'g' glyps. Some kids can't recognize or get
    confused with the shapes of different fonts.\r\n3.- Use font in large size: 12
    and up...\r\n4.- Most important: BE CAREFULL, even more than other designs. Kids
    believe everything you publish, so take a time to check everything.\r\n5.- EVEN
    most important: HAVE FUN. (i miss a lot that magazine)\r\n\r\nHope it helps\r\n\r\n "

    people have said that there is no evidence that children have more trouble with
    a two storied a and g. I think this is just a persistent myth. \r\n\r\nThe 'have
    fun' advice sounds great though!\r\n\r\n"
