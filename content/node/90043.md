body: "The list of OpenType features along with their specifications is listed here
  :\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/featuretags.htm\r\n\r\nI'm having
  an hard time determining who this document is intended for especially when it comes
  to the \"Feature interaction\" field.\r\n\r\nFor example, I paste here the documentation
  for hlig (historical ligatures)\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nTag: 'hlig'\r\nFriendly name:
  Historical Ligatures\r\nRegistered by: Microsoft\r\n<b>Function</b>: Some ligatures
  were in common use in the past, but appear anachronistic today. Some fonts include
  the historical forms as alternates, so they can be used for a 'period' effect. This
  feature replaces the default (current) forms with the historical alternates.\r\nExample:
  The user applies this feature using Palatino Linotype, and historic ligatures are
  formed for all long s forms, including: long s+t, long s+b, long s+h, long s+k,
  and several others.\r\nRecommended implementation: The hlig table maps default ligatures
  and character combinations to corresponding historical ligatures (GSUB lookup type
  1).\r\n<b>Application interface</b>: For GIDs found in the hlig coverage table,
  the application passes the GIDs to the hlig table and gets back new GIDs.\r\n<b>UI
  suggestion</b>: This feature should be off by default.\r\n<b>Script/language sensitivity</b>:
  None.\r\n<b>Feature interaction</b>: This feature overrides the results of all other
  features.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe following is clear to me :\r\n\"Function\"
  is intended to be read, understood and complied to by the font designer.\r\n\r\n\"Application
  interface\" is intended to be for opentype shaping engine like Uniscribe or DirectWrite
  or perhaps applications that interpret themselves the opentype tables.\r\n\r\n\"UI
  suggestion\" is for the consuming applications like InDesign, Microsoft Word, etc...\r\n\r\n\"Script/language
  sensitivity\" I think this is for the font designer to limit the application of
  this feature only to certain languages.\r\n\r\n\"Feature interaction\" No idea :
  should it be the shaping engine that takes care of that, the consuming applications
  or the font designer?!!? Does anyone know?\r\n\r\nFor hlig, it says : \"This feature
  overrides the results of all other features.\" What does this means and who is responsible
  for enforcing it?"

    working in type tech and techy type designers.\r\n\r\n<cite>For hlig, it says
    : \"This feature overrides the results of all other features.\" What does this
    means and who is responsible for enforcing it?</cite>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also a
    suggestion. It means that it makes sense to place the <em>hlig</em> feature towards
    the end of the feature list, like the <em>kern</em> feature, the order of execution
    of which will be defined in the font file.\r\nYou are responsible for ordering
    features. Nobody is responsible for enforcing anything.\r\n\r\n"

    of some open type resources I'm unaware of.\r\n\r\nMichel, your profile says that
    your occupation is \"academic\". Are you a font designer, and /or an application
    developer?\r\n\r\nI'm always looking for contacts that develop application text
    engines or that use shaping engine technology such as uniscribe or directwrite
    or anything else. There isn't much of these guys in the world and help is scarce.\r\n\r\nI'm
    one of these lonely guy :) I'm a software developer that works on the CorelDRAW's
    text engine."

  body: "Bonjour Claude,\r\n\r\nI am neither a font designer nor an application developer.
    I had to learn a few things about fonts just to be able to use (debug or install)
    them, either to write my own (rather mathematical) texts with latex or to get
    a correct display with \"exotic\" languages or fonts on my Macintosh. \r\n\r\nI
    think you should find the right people on the opentype list.\r\n\r\nMichel "
