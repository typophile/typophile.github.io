  body: Thanks for the links. Unfortunately, while information on Eric Gill is plentiful,
    there is no info on who designed the <em>Light</em> weight of Gill Sans. As far
    as I know, Eric Gill just designed the original roman and italic faces; the Light
    weight (in the Adobe set) appears to be far more recent. I'd love it if someone
    could clarify this.

  body: That would be new for me. AFAIK he did  create every weight singularily, but
    not in a mechanical way from one master-weight, but gave each weight its special
    character. That reflects his sense of manufacturing. Rough translation from <a

    then approved by a committee before being cut. \r\n\r\nAnd the specifics of a
    \"design\" usually changed from metal to photocomp to digital. Usually not for
    the best, though sometimes fonts were improved. Gill died around 1940, before
    photocomp.\r\n\r\nBTW, Gill's best text font was probably Pilgrim, which to my
    knowledge, has never been digitized. There was a photocomp version, not too successful
    because the setwidths were poorly done. With a lot of work on the kerning, it
    was quite nice. We use to set the <cite>South Atlantic Quarterly</cite> in Pilgrim,
    but had to change to different fonts when PostScript & PDF files became the norm. "

    was guessing something like that had happened. It looks to me like the Light face

    photocomp. It's a shame that history doesn't record Gill's posthumous 'collaborator',
    Gill Sans Light is something to be proud of, IMHO.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Linotype

    it in PostScript. Unfortunately, no old-style figures or small caps; without them,
    it is useless to me (& should be useless to everybody). Looking at it, I suspect
    that all they did was re-digitize the Linotron 202 font, which had such a bad
    character fit.\r\n\r\nThe basis for Pilgrim was Bunyan, a private press font.
    I believe Bunyan never had an italic -- I use to know what Linotype did for an
    italic, but have forgotten. It would be nice if the new Linotype/Monotype conglomerate
    had gone back to the metal fonts & done it right. Pilgrim was a better text font
    than Joanna & far better than Perpetua.\r\n\r\n* * * \r\n\r\nI just went & looked,
    Gill Sans Light was available for the Linotron 202, a photocomp machine. Linotype
    & Monotype cross-licensed fonts in those days, since fonts were proprietary to
    the typesetting machine."

    and Linotype are generally obscured in the mists of time. You have to remember
    that up until recently the manufacture of type was viewed as just that: manufacturing.
    Type design was essentially an industrial art. There were scores of folks working
    in the drawing office dutifully drawing out all the characters for each size of
    any given design. They were not generally acknowledged individually. \r\n\r\nSome
    of these identities can be recovered, at least for Linotype, by searching the
    archive of drawings at the Museum of Printing in North Andover. Linotype drawings
    used a format similar to industrial or architectural drawings, with title boxes
    listing all the pertinent manufacturing information, project number, date, etc.,
    including the worker who did the drawing and approval signatures from the chain
    of approval. (I not familiar with the Monotype drawing practices.)\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"

    than with offset. The ink spread will make the type appear a little heavier in
    letterpress. This happens with all papers, even coated stocks, though the amount
    of spread will vary with the paper. Usually the center of the stroke is lighter
    with letterpress -- the ink is pushed out -- but the edge heavier, so the general
    appearance is of a little more weight, and better definition. "

  body: "A few notes on the Gill article by Ben Archer in Wills link\r\n\r\n<cite>
    There are three developmental forms of the Gill Sans lowercase \u2018a\u2019 on
    record; revisions were made at the Monotype drawing office and passed back to
    Gill for approval. The original design for \u2018a\u2019 is strikingly similar
    to Johnston\u2019s (as might be expected), followed by a second attempt which
    was put into production and can be seen on early specimen sheets. The third and
    least satisfactory character is seen in all versions of Gill Sans since the early
    1930s</cite> \r\nI have seen the second version in logos and signs dating from
    at least the mid eighties, so at least in photo comp & display it must have survived
    much longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite> Gill obliterated the terminus endings of the vertical
    stroke in \u2018b\u2019, \u2018d\u2019, \u2018p\u2019 and \u2018q\u2019; the Monotype
    drawing office again came to his assistance and revised the forms so that they
    were preserved in the medium weight (this can be seen on early samples of the
    series 262). Today however, this feature only persists in the lightest weight
    of the digital GillSans.</cite> \r\n\r\nThese details have survived in the regular
    cut of Bitstreams version."

  body: "I understand how in Britain you could get thoroughly sick of Gill Sans' eccentricities,
    from overexposure to it. But I don't agree with much of Archer's sour analysis
    of it. \r\n\r\nYes, you can argue about the \"a\" tail being too small, but it
    is in character with the two-weight or relatively highly modulated g and e, and
    does have a flavor and way of spacing that is a different and arguably good solution.
    \r\n\r\nThere are to me a lot of virtues in Gill's design, and shortcomings in
    Johnston's that Archer doesn't note. \r\n\r\nThe biggest defect in  Johnston's
    Underground is that the lower case has clotted joins. This is a fundamental defect
    that needed to be remedied somehow. It is still that way in P22 London Underground,
    which I think is a pretty faithful revival. Others under the influence of Johnston's
    none the less still great type face have fixed it in different ways. \r\n\r\nStill,
    Gill's ideas are by and large very good and to me work visually. The two-weight
    a is a way of getting all those stacked strokes into the space without being clotted.
    The g does the same and I think beautifully. \r\n\r\nThe spurless b d p q are
    also ways of reducing clotting in the joins, and add interest to the face, as
    well as solving a problem. I don't think they are a defect at all. Jeremy Tankard's
    beautiful Bliss follows Gill here,  with characters that I personally like better
    than Gill's, but draw on his ideas. Tankard's g also follows Gill's lead, again
    with a different solution, though in this case not superior to Gill's. \r\n\r\nGill's
    face, with its modulations in key spots, overall gives a clean confident impression.
    Its sharp  t and other details make it a bit too aggressive for my taste, which
    is why I prefer the softer and more elegant Bliss. \r\n\r\nStill there are occasions
    on which Gill's more assertive look will do better. It may be way over exposed
    in Britian, but it was and still is a good typeface. I really can't see the lower
    case of Johnston's face being well used \"as is\" for text at all. I fondly remember
    Johnston's caps on Underground stations from my years in England, and I hope they
    never change them. The lower case is not so bad on big signage, but still not
    so great either. \r\n\r\nFor all its eccentricities, Gill Sans is still a great
    face for print. I can't say that for Johnston's lower case.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "
