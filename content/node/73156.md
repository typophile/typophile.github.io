  body: Looks like Univers, either <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/univers_std_39_thin_ultra_condensed/?&sample_text=GOOD%20FRIDAY&sample_size=74&acs_pt=32&update=0">Thin
    Ultra Condensed</a> or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/univers_std_49_light_ultra_condensed/?&sample_text=GOOD%20FRIDAY&sample_size=74&acs_pt=32&update=0">Light
    Ultra Condensed</a>. I keep switching back and forth between them to the point
    where I'm convinced that it's an in-between weight; maybe a stroke's been added
    to Thin?
