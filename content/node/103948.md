  late thirties.\r\nPart of a self-initiated research, I've been looking for a portrait
  photography of him without any success so far.\r\nI've asked Linotype, the Klingspor
  Museum and the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Darmstadt. Any of these institutions has
  seen a picture of this designer. Before enquiring at Offenbach's city archives,
  where he was born, I decided to post on this forum.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for
  your help.\r\n\r\nMathieu Christe"
