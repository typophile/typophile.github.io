body: '[[http://www.bloomberg.com/]] has been using this combination for a while:
  Proxima for headlines, Akzidenz for text. What do you think of this combination?
  Also , why do they switch to Arial+Helvetica in the company menu? If you''re paying
  for webfonts, which make Bloomberg stand out against more traditional competitors,
  why not use them.'

  body: 'I always have a disaffection for Proxima Nova''s lowercase <em>a</em>. But
    overall it''s acceptable: Proxima''s vivid character comparing with the tastelessness
    of Akzidenz Grotesk.'

    here [[ http://www.bloomberg.com/]]  , not so much on Bloomberg. '

  body: Thank you for pointing that out, Nick, it's my mistake. I meant Akzidenz (ex)
    looks better on Fasano's website [[http://www.fasano.com.br/]], than Bloomberg's.
