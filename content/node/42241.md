body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nWe've just redesigned (or more accurately - had redesigned)
  our magazine and the dude has chosen freight micro as our serif font, which is nice.
  I quite like it, its a bit all over the shop in a nice way. But when it is display
  size all these little bits of mess look most scruffy and awkard. I can just about
  get away with using it all caps, but I don't like being constrained this way. \r\n\r\nCould
  anyone kindly suggest some similar yet more suitable slabs for headlines so I may
  offer it to my bosses as a replacement?\r\n\r\nIt would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nG

    so they commissioned a display cut of the micro. Maybe I don't remember correctly,
    but it's worth a bit of research time...

  body: "na. Its a not exactly of the same style. They wouldn't like it. 'too old
    fashioned' would probably be the cry. Though freight micro really reminds me of
    playbill once its display size and that seems somewhat dated ay?\r\n\r\n"

    Its out there and we can't get it! \r\n\r\nThanks Paul. Well now my problem is;
    big company, small budget for fonts, so I'll have to find something else as I
    don't think they'll wanna fund another freight redesign.\r\n\r\nJust wished they'd
    asked my opinion before choosing fonts.\r\n\r\noh well\u2026"
