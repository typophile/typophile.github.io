    Why not \"giving up\" and simply considering it as handwritten, not a font? \r\n\r\nEDIT:
    some very (very...) loosely similar: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/mister-earl/|Mister
    Earl]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/coffeedance/|Coffeedance]] (my choice),
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/etruscan/|Etruscan]], [[http://www.ffonts.net/Pea-Mary-Katie.font|Pea
    Mary Katie]] (also [[http://www.ffonts.net/Pea-Mary-Katie-Skinny.font|Skinny]])\r\nTry
    also the \"More font like [...]\" function at MF (start for instance with [[http://www.myfonts.com/morelike/1593/|Coffeedance]])."
