  to Fontlab. Some glyphs do not work properly eventhough they look exacly the same.  <BR>
  <BR>The actual font is a rather simple one-line/stroke font and all glyphs are therefore
  build the exact same way. The &#34;a&#34; for instance is allright when pastet in
  Fontlab but the &#34;b&#34; mess up - the anchor points &#40;I guess&#41; are....wrong
  &#40;!&#41; one way or another. It looks like one or two anchorpoint are &#34;missing&#34;
  and the result is that Fontlab are just filling out the area with black &#40;my
  bad english cant really explain it better!&#41;To me it seems pretty random which
  glyphs causes problems - it can be simple strokes &#40;&#34;c&#34; forexamble&#41;
  while &#34;t&#34; is working correct etc. <BR> <BR>My workflow: I have all my Illustrator
  glyphs on a single line - I copy each glyphs to a new Illu document and scale it
  up, setting up zero-point etc. - I copy the glyph to Fontlab. Over and over again.
  <BR> <BR> <BR>Anyone knows what Im talking about!?;&#41; Or have any suggestions
  to what might be wrong &#40;or eventually have had the same problem&#41;?'
