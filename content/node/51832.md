body: "Hello friends,\r\n\r\nI think I posted this logotype here a while ago, but
  I wanted to run it by you again, as we're getting ready to do a little rebranding.\r\n\r\nThe
  Fort Wayne Dance Collective is a 30-year old non-profit arts organization in Fort
  Wayne, Indiana, which focuses on movement, rhythm and language as a performance
  art. Although the organization started as a modern dance studio, it's grown to be
  much more than just dance, and it incorporates a school with dozens of kinds of
  classes, a taiko drumming ensemble, a jenb\xE9 drumming ensemble, yoga, t'ai chi,
  etc.\r\n\r\nThere has been talk of changing its name, since \"Dance Collective\"
  is no longer completely accurate, but since that has been our name for 30 years,
  and that's what everyone knows us by, that may not happen.\r\n\r\nWe're waiting
  to get a grant for a big rebranding campaign from a local Advertising & PR firm,
  and although they'll be doing a lot of work for us, something I wanted some preliminary
  help with from you fine folks is our logo. It is (hopefully) going to get redesigned.\r\n\r\nI
  have some background in design, but not so much as I think I could take on this
  task. I want to run our current logo by you and see what you might do to make it
  looks better, so when I go to them with some basic ideas, I won't sound like an
  idiot.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here's the logo and the wording:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FWDClogotype_6330.jpg]\r\n\r\nBefore
  I came, the little pair of people dancing were not enclosed in a circle, so everytime
  they were displayed, it looked insignificant and too engulfed by white space. I
  inversed the dancers and enclosed them in a purple circle, which is FWDC's main
  color. I haven't had the heart to nix the little spirally things and the confetti,
  as my director really loves it.\r\n\r\nThe type is in DaVinci, which was brought
  to the table by a cheap freelancer 8 or 9 years ago. I like what it is trying to
  accomplish, but I just don't like how the letters connect together. I tried to bring
  in the kerning a little bit, but it just doesn't do it for me.\r\n\r\nI would like
  this to morph into something that is a really nice, tight, self-contained design.
  At the same time, though, I want to convey that the Dance Collective is a progressive,
  revolutionary arts org that is on its way up in profile, but still maintains its
  grassroots, something that's few and far between here in conservative northeast
  Indiana.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions or ideas? I would love to hear any of them.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Andy
  Welfle"
