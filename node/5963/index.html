<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi there! I've been lurking around here for quite some time but now I've finally registered.. <br> <br>I'd love to get some comments and critique on the Corporate Identity for my Webpage. <br> <br>It's called bloobseven.. the left symbol stands for an abstract b and the right one for an abstract 7.. <br> <br>I rounded the edges to make it easier to look at it and added a bit perspective to make it look more interesting and recognizable.. what do you think? <br> <br>Also I'm struggling with the Font Type <br>Currently I'm using Microgramma which was modified a bit in the top left logo version <br> <br>c&c appreciated <br> <br>thx, mike <br> <br>Edit: somehow the html code doesn't work properly.. anyway here's the link: <br> <br>http://sile.dhcp.at/bloob_ci.jpg</div>

<div class=commentbody>I guess the biggest concern I would have on your behalf is in the mark. In the 50's "squares" (brainiacs, nerds, mamma's boys) were called "L-7s", and your mark distinctively looks more like an "L-7" than a "b-7". This might not have been such a big deal, but this "L-7" identity had somewhat of a revival in the 90's, as an abbreviated version "L" (Loser) was popularized to the masses by Smashmouth's #1 single. The mark is achieved by pointing up and extending the thumb outward to create the "L" shape, similar to how the youth of the 50's created an "L" with one hand and a "7" with the other to form a square. I guess my point is that I think too many people still recognize what "L-7" represents. <br> <br>Aesthetically, it does make a nice shape</div>

<div class=commentbody>hi! thx for your replies! <br> <br>well bloob7 doesn't necessarily mean anything.. It just popped into my head and I liked it, cause I think it's quite unusual and therefore pretty catchy <br> <br>Bloobseven is my online portfolio , which is currently offline though, where I showcase my work such as CI,websites etc. <br> <br>I didn't go into the direction of calling it Michael Nagy Design on purpose, cause personally I think it sounds too serious <br> <br>@Mark: Personally I'd prefer a logo rather than a wordmark but in this case I think that the wordmark doesn't necessarily fit the logo <br> <br>@ Scott: I can see your concern but as far as I know the L7 stuff started in America and since I live in Europe, the concern shrinks a bit. <br> <br>Keep the comments and ideas coming please.. I'll then try to rework it</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with Scott, although I was not aware of the historical significance of L7. But that is what your logo looks like. A simple solution may be to fill up the negative space between the two characters with the bowl of the b. However that may throw off the balance and look cartoonish. <br> <br>Would you please post a link to your page, it will help the forum give a more informed critique. I tried bloobseven.com but got some kind of on-line coupons site, so the name is not so unique. Also tried bloob7 which linked back to bloobseven and was unsucessful searching on Google as well. <br> <br>look back at other critiques "Klim", "TY (self identity)" and "Munoz" are especially good. I'd send you to mine but I haven't developed a sucessful solution yet. <br> <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33935.html?1091697787 target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33935.html?1091697787</a> <br> <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20969.html?1089339624 target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20969.html?1089339624</a> <br> <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27518.html?1083707071 target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27518.html?1083707071</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>Michael, <br> <br>Try a few other fonts like Infinity ExtraBold from Thirstype: <br><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thirstype/infinity/stextra-bold/testdrive.html?s=bloobseven&p=48" target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thirstype/infinity/stextra-bold/testdrive.html?s=bloobseven&p=48</a> <br>Infinity isn't over-used like Microgamma and Eurostyle. <br> <br>I think if you used "creative" or "design" with bloobseven it would work better. There is nothing wrong with using a name that has no real meaning, but I would put a word that does have meaning with it. Try placing it under bloobseven small with about 1000 points of tracking: <br><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thirstype/infinity/stextra-bold/testdrive.html?s=CREATIVE&p=16" target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thirstype/infinity/stextra-bold/testdrive.html?s=CREATIVE&p=16</a> <br> <br>Also experiment with possibly having rounded corners on your card. That would fit your design. <br> <br>On the back of the card I would use a different font than what your logo is done with and separate your name from the icon.</div>

<div class=commentbody>@Kirsten : <br> <br>I do agree that it looks a lot like L7 but I liked the shape and the fact that those two letters form a kind of circle. <br> <br>I'll try to work something out to make it look more like a b without losing the current felling and look of the logo though. <br> <br>The reason for bloobseven.com and bloob7.com redirecting to a coupon/ad site is that I took my page offline last august and didn't pay the extension for the domain.. so some cheeky bloke simply nicked it. <br> <br>Anyway, if you want to see a few pieces of my artwork go to <a href=http://sile.dhcp.at/bloobseven/reference.html target=_blank>http://sile.dhcp.at/bloobseven/reference.html</a> <br> <br>the first pic is a screenshot of bloobseven v1 which was online from 01.01.01 until august 02 <br> <br>the second pic is a screenshot of v2 which was online until august 03 <br> <br>@ Tom: <br> <br>I actually don't intend to buy a font for my logo simply cause I don't want to afford it atm. <br> <br>Forget the cards, they're just temporary.. I just wanted to show you something where the logo could be placed <br> <br>btw. I like Bloob Creative.. do you think I should get rid of the 7?</div>

<div class=commentbody>IMHO, 'bloob' is just way too gimmicky. It's like those 'ploids' or 'Flooz' and other childish made-up names during the height of the dot-com bubble. <br> <br>There's also the childish humour of 'boob' that I can't help snickering at. ;o) <br> <br>And to add to scott's wonderful history of silly pop culture, L7 was also 90's era band: <br> <br><a href=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431079/07301999/nulll_seven.jhtml target=_blank>http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431079/07301999/nulll_seven.jhtml</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>I still feel you should explore upper and lower case together and bolden it. Make creative the same color as seven (as well as the lighter part of the icon). Also try moving the icon 3/4 of the way to the left of the title above it just to see how that looks.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Is this an eye chart test? in small sizes Creative is unreadable. Why space creative the whole length of the name? Try just having it the length of Seven and get rid of the silly letter spacing. Take your b7 and flush it left the width of Bloob. Just suggestions, but the legibility is a problem in small sizes.</div>
