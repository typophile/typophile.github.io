    counts among IPA\u2019s predecessors, we may admitt some little progress on the
    long run, at least.\r\n\r\nThere will be not much request to font this \u2026"

  body: "What is the difference between glyph 09 and U+0268? And between glyph 22
    and U+0263?\r\n\r\nI read about phonetic notation to be case insensitive \u2013so
    all phonetic glyphs would be lowercase. But this proposal deals with upper/lower
    cases, as 05/06 or 31/32. It also adds glyph 16, which is an uppercase to U+0277.
    So in past times phonetic notation (at last the English one) was case senstitive?\r\n\r\nThe
    glyph 50 is nice.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Number 17 is the international symbol for thong underwear, and when paired
    with number 18 is the symbol for the kind of mothers who buy thong underwear for
    their twelve year-old daughters.
