  body: You can't purchase licenses for those fonts. That's the whole point of proprietary
    fonts -- they're exclusive and thus unavailable to the general audience.

  body: install the nokia pc suite on a windows box and the fonts Nokia Sans Wide
    and Nokia Standard Multiscript get installed in your TEMP folder. I use it all
    over my computer(s) at the moment be it win, lin, or mac. Great for screen (even
    in 6pt) not so great on paper.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nokia_3998.sans.png]

    most purposes.
