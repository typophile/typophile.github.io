  when I purchased OSX 10.4. \r\n\r\nI have been running into a font problem, only
  with fonts from Emigre \u2014 mainly Mrs Eaves and Filosofia.\r\n\r\nThe problem
  is that when typing, the word-space does not appear visible making it very hard
  to spell check. I turned invisibles on and there is record of a space but it does
  not appear. \r\n\r\nAnyone having this problem?\r\n\r\n\u2014 Jer"

    microsoft word and macromedia flash 8 are all displaying this problem on my g4
    laptop with 10.4.7.\r\nStrangely, the same fonts work fine in adobe cs2 products
    such as Illustrator or inDesign\r\n\r\nHave tried everything I can think of to
    fix the problem.\r\n\r\nNo solution found. Still working on it."

  body: "The one solution I've found to this issue is to convert the font to individual
    .pfb files with <a href=\"http://fondu.sourceforge.net/#Fondu\">Fondu</a> and
    then convert these files to a more useful format. I have used FontForge for this.
    Based on the <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/FAQ.php\">Emigre FAQ</a>, I think
    this kind of conversion is allowed:\r\n\r\n<cite>The Emigre Fonts license does
    allow the user to convert the fonts to other formats as long as the user has purchased
    the appropriate user license and the converted fonts continue to be used in accordance
    with this license. In addition, the converted fonts must retain the original Emigre
    copyright notice.</cite>\r\n\r\nAfter conversion, the spaces appear as expected."
