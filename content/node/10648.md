body: 'Hello everybody. <BR> <BR>This is Janaina, an attempt to design a text  <BR>font
  for reading on screen and printed media. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m designing it as my final
  project at college, <BR>so any kind of comment will be very useful. <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t
  work spacing and kerning yet, so I&#39;m  <BR>sorry I couldn&#39;t provide consistent
  examples of  <BR>the font in use.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tried to keep the x-height
  as large as  <BR>possible and avoided much thin/thick contrast  <BR>to help with
  low-resolution appearance, but I&#39;m  <BR>still analyzing how those design decisions  <BR>would
  affect the overall readability. <BR> <BR>&#39;Q&#39; is still very experimental,
  as well as font <BR>diacritics. I&#39;ll have to work hard on that too,  <BR>because
  the font is intended to be used in  <BR>Portuguese language. <BR> <BR>Thanks in
  advance, <BR>hugocristo <BR> <BR><!--attachment: janainaroman-7202.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*7.4*Janaina+Roman*janainaroman%2eswf

  body: Hugo, it seems that flash is wreaking havoc with your   <BR>curves, some of
    them look as if they&#39;ve been cut with   <BR>scissors - at my end at least.
    It gets difficult to judge   <BR>the sort of abrupt, &#39;uncultivated&#39; style
    of the characters,   <BR>the sort of inconsistency in stress and thickness of
    the   <BR>curves... Does it work? Does it look amateurish? Or is   <BR>it just
    a bug?  <BR>  <BR>I agree with Eduardo about the proportions and the squarish  <BR>B.
    Also, the &#34;midline&#34; of B,E,F,H,R seems a bit too high.  <BR>Well, there
    are other problems to sort out, as you know.  <BR>I dig the Jj. I once designed
    one similar to this.  <BR>  <BR>abra

    I&#39;ll try that and post some  <BR>tests here. <BR> <BR>Eduardo: <BR>&#39;B&#39;
    is one of my favorite problems <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>... I&#39;ll <BR>check &#39;S&#39; and &#39;a&#39; as well.
    Talking about reading  <BR>for screen, I meant both hinting and fixed-size <BR>bitmaped
    fonts. I&#39;m taking this way because  <BR>I&#39;m working with type1 so I won&#39;t
    get accurated  <BR>screen hinting and I&#39;ll need that for web <BR>applications
    &#40;mostly shockwave, but I&#39;m <BR>considering MS WEFT too&#41;. <BR> <BR>In
    fact I&#39;m printing the font in large sizes  <BR>on transparent paper and then
    &#39;squaring&#39; each <BR>glyph to fit my intended size grid &#40;8 to 14pt&#41;.
    <BR>Dunno if that&#39;s the best way of doing it but <BR>it&#39;s working for
    me. <BR> <BR>Rodolfo: <BR>I&#39;ve attached a PDF example here. I hope it  <BR>doesn&#39;t
    look amateurish anymore <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>The font is almost complete, so I think it&#39;s  <BR>to
    start refining each character. As soon as I  <BR>finish the figures I&#39;ll try
    to post some  <BR>improvements here. <BR> <BR>Thanks again <BR>hugocristo <BR><!--attachment:
