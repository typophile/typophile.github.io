  of working with multiple translations and language/character sets (English, Chinese,
  Japanese, Cyrillic, etc)\r\n\r\ncould be as simple as a break down of terms: 'what's
  a sans serif' equivalent called in Chinese simplified? to more technical side of
  working with fonts across languages (addressing missing characters, accessing and
  using fonts etc.)\r\n\r\nanyone have some good reference sites or pointers?\r\n\r\nmany
  thanks\r\n/brad"
