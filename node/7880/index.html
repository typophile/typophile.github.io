Two things I want to find out; the first is wether this project is even worth pursuing and second, do the letters have a certain harmony to them &#40; please try to ignore the letter &#39;s&#39; in your examination as i have not spent much time developing it  and consider it &#39;unfinished&#39;&#41;.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/54539.jpg" alt=" type sketches"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some very interesting glyphs you have for a starting point. I may be wrong, but I am guessing that you have been looking at a lot of fonts you really like &#40;including Lux typographics/ Esquire magazines Crank8 font for the second &#34;k&#34;. and perhaps work from UK&#39;s The Foundry as well. I am NOT suggesting that you should not use these as starting points, nor that the work is &#34;copied&#34; but I do think it it influenced and there is nothing wrong with that. Did you &#40; like I have done myself in the past&#41; decided if only I could fit all these unusual tweaks into a single font it would be the &#34;ultimate&#34;. Seems like a <BR>great idea. Well be careful, for it become a very difficult task. Hrant gave me very good advice once, which was &#34;be careful of glyph love&#34;. And by the way I really like the glyphs you have here regardless of where the ideas came from .   <BR>Is it worth persuing? Yes. Next step is unification. &#34;o&#34; is very cool but will not fit with rest. The more tweaks the less userbility.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;I am guessing that you have been looking at a lot of fonts you really like&#60; <BR> <BR>Well I haven&#39;t been looking at other fonts to be honest with you. I thought I could &#39;start from scratch&#39; &#40;if there is such a thing&#41;. But I must admit that at a subconscious level I was influenced. I had no idea of the similarities! But I do admit the second &#39;k&#39; was seen in the Esquire magazine i subcribe too. I just love it. You&#39;re right about &#39;o&#39; it does not fit, sometimes i get carried away. I will take your advice to heart about the tweaks on each glyph. Too much does hinder userbility. what do u think about the &#39;g&#39; , &#39;b&#39; and &#39;d&#39; do they fit? I think they might be off. Thanks fror the critique you guys. <BR> <BR>Any more suggestions, anyone? <BR> <BR>IM</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, this is a bit discouraging. <BR>It&#39;s seems that the type i hoped would be somewhat original reminds people of other fonts.

How does one design great typefaces that stand out and not look like everything else? Can such thing be accomplished? I hope there is someone out there with advice that can help me. I really feel like I have the potential for good type design &#40; I know this because of the love i have for the printed word and typography&#41; and i don&#39;t want to give up on this! <BR> <BR>Any advice <BR>Ivan M</div>

This style is in the air, I guess. But what you have so far can still serve as a great starting point I think. Here&#39;s an idea: try adding stroke contrast - most such designs are monoline. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

I did not continue the work, because i wanted to make something new and the new designs reminded me too much of Yellow. But, go ahead. And, please, try that &#42;o&#42; with the contrasting diagonals. If you go from there and apply this principle to the other letters, something totally different will come out of it.
