  I can&#39;t post an image, but the link I think is good enough - I&#39;m interested
  in &#34;Realitatea.TV&#34; <BR> <BR>Other infos you might find useful &#40;although
  it didn&#39;t help me with Identifont&#41; are:  <BR>&#34;g&#34; is single story,
  &#34;l&#34; is like in FF Din, Trebuchet, &#34;M&#34; similar with Futura, &#34;C&#34;
  similar to Myriad, &#34;J&#34; ends bellow the baseline and has a backward pointing
  bar, &#34;4&#34; is closed, &#34;1&#34; similar to The Sans Mono, etc. <BR>I thought
  it was from FF - as it has Central European characters and many Romanian television
  networks are already using FF Din - but I couldn&#39;t find it.'

    &#39;R&#39; has a much different structure.

  body: 'Sorry I can&#39;t yet help you with a bigger image. Indeed it looks very
    much like FF Info, with a couple of minor but decisive differences: &#34;I&#34;
    doesn&#39;t have serifs in my font, the middle part of &#34;M&#34; in Info is
    slighty above the baseline, and the &#34;4&#34; in my font is closed. I wonder
    if there could be an FF Info Alt version ?!'
