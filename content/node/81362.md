    \"similars\" you've probably already inspected and more certainly less close:
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/annonce/|Annonce]] (/C and /S more similar

  body: Thanks for the suggestions! I think Standard CT Extended Extra Bold is probably
    the closest I've seen, although I doubt most people could distinguish any of these
    from the Clockwork Orange text! You guys are pros. And yes, something does look
    a little "off" with some of the letters in the titles...
