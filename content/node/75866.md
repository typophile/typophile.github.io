  and while fishing around for topics I thought about trying to find some competitions
  with interesting briefs that might provide a good starting point. I found [[http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/content.cfm/writing-awards
  | this one]] run by AIGA, but it's only open to US residents, and doesn't propose
  its own topics or titles. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if any current magazines, professional
  associations or publishers for example run a regular scheme?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nAnthony."
