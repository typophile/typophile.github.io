  body: "here's my take:\r\n\r\nif you're applying for an open position, it's probably
    not that important. they will review your cover letter/resume, portfolio (if asked
    for yet) and decide who to call in for interviews.\r\n\r\nbut if you're fishing,
    if you're going around doing informational interviews, if the position you want
    isn't open at the moment (or doesn't officially exist yet), then a biz card could
    be effective, because in that case, you wanna keep your name in the minds of the
    powers that be. cards go into wallets, beside computer monitors, in roledex files,
    etc. etc.  they are another opportunity for your name to come up when the time
    is right."

  body: "My business card was a 1 colour poster/ which folded up to a reasonable size
    and had a calendar on it. I made sure the graphics where good enough for them
    to pin it up on the wall since I was fishing. That way when there was a position
    available it would be easier for them to remember me. I got 4 offers in the same
    week;-)\r\n\r\nMy advice is make something you can afford that stands out. Die
    cuts are expensive, you might want to consider something else.\r\n\r\nGood hunting!"

  body: "I think it can always help.\r\nAlthough the \"look\" has to reflect what
    you offer as a designer (high costs?), you don't have to spend a lot on such a
    thing... Cards are mostly valuable for what they are, not for the features in
    their presentation.\r\n\r\nAnyway, people ARE sensible to these kind of promotion,
    so I'd rather have a simple nice card than none at all. I personally prefer creative
    and economic approaches, because as I see it they tend to reflect more of what
    one is and can do.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nwww.gabssnake.4t.com"

  body: A business card is a must. You never know who you are going to meet. It's
    vital to have a card you can hand someone with your web site, phone number, and
    email address. It's less important once you have the interview but it can't hurt.
    You're better off with something simple, now, than waiting for your fancy die-cut
    card.

  body: "It's not all that important to the job interview process, but Pattyfab has
    a point, that it will help if you meet people casually at events and whatnot.
    Design firms may or may not have a job posted, but they're nearly always willing
    to make room for the right person because they're so hard to find.\r\n\r\nOnce
    you have the interview, if the resume isn't stellar and the portfolio is just
    okay, a personal card will not win you more points.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you have
    a great resume and your portfolio is solid then giving me a business card makes
    it easier to get in touch with you. In that case it's a bonus, but still not necessary.\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck in your search. "

    networking.\r\n\r\nA good design, logo, attractive type and more than two colours
    doesn't hurt either."

  body: "I agree that having a business card is a must, for all of the reasons already
    stated above. I've had my own card since I started seeking freelance work about
    a year ago, and I always make sure to give it to anybody who interviews me, be
    it a recruiter or a studio manager.\r\n\r\nIf you are strapped for cash, Avery
    makes some great business card templates these days, which you can print on laser
    or inkjet printers... The edges are smooth and the papers are available in matte
    or glossy finishes.\r\n\r\nBest of luck!"

  body: You can also print a small batch of cards with inkjet printer. I did just
    that, when I had a meeting with client's client, and we agreed, that it would
    look better if I had a card with my client's name, address and website, but my
    own mobile number. A local stationary shop sells A4 sized cardboard for printing
    purposes.

  body: "Everyone needs a  business card. It's a basic tool of communications and
    networking.\r\n\r\nIf you can make it 'wow!' great, but the basic need is just
    to be able to hand someone your contact information. They'll be that more likely
    to stick it in the rolodex and that more likely to give you a call when the time
    comes.\r\n\r\nAs for custom die-cuts, surf the scrapbooking sites that offer custom
    stamps and paper punches. You might be able to find something to match your concept
    or even fine a place that will make a custom one for you.\r\n"

    but because you looked at a problem, came up with a useful solution, and probably
    did a helluva good job with it. You gave them something that screamed ... I can
    do this kind of work, and do it well.\r\n\r\nAs well as the four who offered the
    job I'll bet there were fourteen others who were kicking themselves because they
    couldn't find a spot to put you. "

    card. You'll get the chance to think about who you are or who you want to be.
    And what is in between ...

  body: "As an occasional portfolio reviewer at a design agency, I don't care if the
    person has a business card or not. Work samples and contact info in an e-mail
    is enough. BUT if the person does have a card it MUST look very good. Not a conceptual
    wonder and I don't care much for fancy die-cut stuff and lots of colours, but
    impeccable typographically and maybe with a hint of character. For me it's an
    extension of the portfolio, and rather than show up with something half decent,
    don't bring it at all. The same goes for the portfolio. I don't want to see work
    done if it isn't something the person showing the portfolio really likes her-
    or himself. Show less, rather than too much. \r\n\r\nThat said, a business card
    is practical for all reasons mentioned above, so...\r\n"

    is more! Make sure everything is tops or leave it out.\r\nI go through tons of
    folios though so a businesscard for me is a good way of remebering the person
    and the folio. \r\n\r\nAre you doing your folio available in a handy digital format?
    Make sure you do. Paper float around a busy office environment and will sooner
    or later be likely to disappear. Most agencys who speak to jobseakers regularly
    have a space on their server for folios where they can go back and find an appropriate
    candidate when the need presents itself. Make sure you're in that pile.\r\n"

  body: "The best way to get work is through networking, it's often who you know.
    Meet up for drinks, give people calls. If you can call them give them a call.\r\n\r\nYou
    do need an identity on paper as well as digital. \r\n\r\nBusiness cards are a
    common way of getting your details across but are often lost on the desk or filing
    system. There is also a case of never being happy or sure that what you have done
    for yourself, and the process tends to drag on, you need to get going the longer
    your out the harder it gets to get back in.\r\nSend examples of your work by email
    or post this works better, send relevant pieces of work not random. Emails are
    sometimes better and people tend not to delete emails and they can find you again
    if you have made an impact. This way people can see how you would fit in. If there
    is a opportunity going then they will remember you and give you a call. \r\n\r\nIf
    you can't get full time then freelance. Get your name of freelanceuk.com if your
    in the UK.\r\n\r\nAs Endre did make something that will be useful and standout,
    possibly instead of a business card to give yourself a better chance of staying
    away from that draw.  "

    i don't think it makes much difference one way or the other, except as one more
    thing for an hr staff to keep track of.\r\ni've interviewed people who gave me
    their cards, and ONLY if it's terrific did it make a good impression. if i've
    just spent time talking with a candidate, hearing why they're perfect for such
    and such creative position, and then they hand me a card that falls short, it
    probably hurts more than no card at all."
