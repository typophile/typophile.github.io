body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI have long lists in the format of\r\n\r\n<strong>[word] [normal
  space] [more words]</strong>\r\n\r\nNow it would be great if I could format it automatically
  into:\r\n\r\n<strong>[word in bold] [n-space] [more words]</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  can get the nested style sheet to change the first word to bold, but how can I change
  the normal space to a 'n-space'?\r\n\r\nI could of course do a normal find&replace
  but then there are so many normal spaces that don't need to be changed, that it
  does not make much sense. Can nested style sheets solve this problem?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help!"

  body: "When you apply the nested styles, give the normal space a unique character
    style.\r\nThen you can do your find&replace for this character style without touching
    any of the other spaces."

  body: Also, you could create a character style with an x-scale (setwidth) that approximates
    the normal space to en-space ratio and apply that to the space after the word.  This
    would be more dynamic as far as later edits goes, but not as precise, perhaps.
