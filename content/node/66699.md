    has recently covered Adidas (Unity, custom by Yomar Augusto) and also Puma (Crepello,
    custom by Paul Barnes):\r\nhttp://fontfeed.com/archives/world-cup-typography-yomar-augusto/\r\nhttp://fontfeed.com/archives/world-cup-typography-paul-barnes/\r\n\r\nNote,
    all these are custom design jobs so I wouldn't expect any of them to become available
    for licensing."
