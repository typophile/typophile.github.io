  a lot like Rockwell except for a few things. The only sample I have is this lo-res

    Can you post a bigger sample, like, ten times this size?"

  body: "I was interested to note that the 'r' in the Bitstream version of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-lubalin-graph/\">Lubalin
    Graph</a> is not the same as the other versions.\r\n\r\nI agree with Florian,
    your MASONRY sample also has the wrong R to be Lubalin - I think it's a different
    font. The one common letter from MASONRY and your other samples seems to be the
    M and it has vertical sides in  the 'name' sample, but looks splayed in MASONRY.\r\n\r\n-
