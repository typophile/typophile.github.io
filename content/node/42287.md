  body: "Hahaha\u2014Thank you though!! My god, you guys reply quite quickly, I wasn't
    expecting that from a blog post. I blogged it first, and was going to move next
    to the message boards. \r\n\r\nI looked it up on myfonts.com, and it seems to
    be  Futura ND (Neufville family) variation. The extra narrow width and extra open
    L sends me in a frenzy!!!! \r\n\r\nI wonder why it didn't strike me as Futura
    right away\u2026you'd think you've seen at least 2 million times\u2026\r\n\r\nDie
    wollen nur spielen\u2026"
