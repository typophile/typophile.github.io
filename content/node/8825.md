  body: It appears to be a font, because the repeated letters look identical. However,
    this style could have been made by anyone.  No skill is required -- just a way
    to  produce a font from crudely drawn letters -- and so you might guess this is
    not my favorite type style, right? <BR> <BR>Well, I know you didn&#39;t ask for
    my opinion of it, but that is my way of explaining that this could have come from
    anywhere. It could have been made only by the person who made the original that
    you saw. <BR> <BR>Only if someone recognizes this particular sample would you
    have a chance of finding it. <BR> <BR>My advice is to look for &#39;distorted&#39;,
    &#39;destroy&#39; or &#39;eroded&#39; fonts at <a href="http://www.dafont.com"
    target="_blank">DaFont</a> and pick something that you think looks close enough.

  body: I see 2 different a&#39;s, two e&#39;s, 3 i&#39;s &#40;including the uppercase&#41;,
    like letters with slightly different rotation and matching letter pairs with different
    spacing between them &#40;see 2nd a-i pair in faisant and a-i pair in jaillir&#41;.
    Makes me wonder if someone drew some characters and stuck them in rough position
    to make these words.

  body: Thank you. <BR>A whole litte book is set with that typeface. <BR>Nothing at
    DaFont is closer to that. <BR>Any other suggestion is welcome. <BR>Best, <BR>AS
