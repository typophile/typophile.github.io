  a brazilian type design teacher interested in my country's history.\r\n\r\nreading
  more about this i've found one particular name: Pieter Janszoon, a dutch typographer
  who was invited to work in Brazil by Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen on 1642.\r\n\r\ni
  was looking for him at Duth Type's pages and i found nothing.\r\n\r\nwell, can you
  give any clues about this subject?"

  body: "Ol\xE1 Buggy. Pesquisei rapidamente e a dificuldade \xE9 porque o nome pelo
    qual ficou mais conhecido \xE9 Pieter Saenredam. O Janszoon \xE0s vezes \xE9 omitido
    e outras fica abreviado (Jaensz.). Pelo que descobri, ele era pintor, sendo o
    primeiro a retratar com realismo e perspectiva correta o interior de v\xE1rias
    igrejas na Holanda.\r\n\r\nA Wikip\xE9dia em holand\xEAs tem algumas informa\xE7\xF5es
    sobre ele, mas n\xE3o faz qualquer refer\xEBncia sobre seu trabalho no Brasil
    ou como tip\xF3grafo:\r\nhttp://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Jansz._Saenredam\r\n\r\n<strong>English:</strong>\r\nThrough
    a quick search, it seems Pieter has better known as Saenredam. Janszoon appears
    sometimes in abbreviated form (Jaensz.) in web searches. He was mainly a painter,
    the first to adopt correct perspective and realism to picture the inner of churches
    in Nederlands.\r\n\r\nDutch version of Wikipedia brings some other information,
    although does not mention any work made in Brazil or as typographer:\r\nhttp://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Jansz._Saenredam"

    person from the one about whom Leonardo is asking.

  body: "You're right! A deeper search showed the person is <strong>Pieter Janszoon
    Post</strong>, another painter. He was personal architect for Mauritius de Nassau
    during the Dutch occupation in Brazil. Anyway, I cannot find any information about
    typography related to him.\r\n\r\nThe mistake is plausible as their living periods
    are very near and both were painters. \r\n\r\nHow do you discovered this, John?
    And why Janszoon is usualy abreviated in Dutch?"

  body: "Janszoon is the Dutch equivalent of Johnson, Jackson, Robertson, and Williamson.
    It's generally used as a sort of middle name, but it survives to this day as the
    common surname Jansen (also sp. \"Janssen\").\r\n\r\nI imagine the abbreviation
    was to save a second in writing :-) It was quite common. The female equivalent
    is \"dr.\", as in \"Kenau Simonsdr. Hasselaar\" (who, by the way, was a woman
    so fearsome that \"kenau\" is used to this day to describe particularly self-assertive
    women ;-))"

  body: "@ Theunis: thanks! If I understood correctly, a son of Jan Timman would be
    also Janszoon if he/she was born during the Baroque. AFAIK, this kind of middle
    name also exists in Russian.\r\n\r\n@ Florian: nice found. The Dutchmen tried
    to implement a print service here but unfortunately it did not succeed. Just in
    middle 1700s, after a century, a printer began to produce books in Rio \u2013
    and soon was prohibited by Portugal and the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nNice thread.\r\n"

  body: "frieberger, i think florian is right. i've just read the text he found. at
    least, a similar one assigned by Carlos Rizzini.\r\n\r\nJanszoon was probably
    a typographer contracted by Nassau to work here, in Recife. Rizzini tells us that
    he used to be famous but i've never heard about him before..."

  body: "Yes, Leonardo. John, Theunis and Florian gave good information about Pieter
    \u2013 much better than mine. It's a pity that typography has been not established.
    The Dutch Brazil is a permanent source of historical research.\r\n\r\nVisitei
    teu blog. Bem interessantes os tipos que pareciam ser da Hamilton."
