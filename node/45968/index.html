<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi all, first post, this seems like a great forum that's full of knowledge.
I'm looking for some input from the period typeface experts. I need to make (aka have fabricated) some large wood cut lettering for a movie set to be historically accurate to the 1920s. I have been researching fonts from the time period with great results - however - it doesn't feel quite right to be using a font for this. I have a sample layout using Gill Sans Bold that looks quite good but I'm not sure if it's right.
Does anybody have some input regarding how a sign like this would be made? How would the letters have been laid out for cutting? Drawn by hand? Stenciled?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Are you asking about wood type (ie, the typefaces cut from wood used on printing presses) or about wooden sign manufacturing?
If you're interested in wood type construction:

<div class=commentbody>In the 1920s, a "font" per se, would not have been used for the design of a sign. Excellent hand-lettering skills were the core of a signmaker's trade. The lettering would have been done by hand. The styles might have had some small influence from the trends in type, but just as often the influence went the other way.
Unless your movie is set in London, the Gill Sans style is not going to be historically accurate. It was heavily influenced by the typeface designed for the London Underground by Gill's teacher, Edward Johnston, ca. 1916. Gill Sans, as a font, was not released until the very end of the 1920s and didn't have much impact in North America until a bit later. I don't know if any sign makers outside of London would have noticed for at least another decade.
If you want some historically accurate suggestions, you should contact Mark Simonson, or hope he stops by this thread. For insight into sign making practices from the period, you could try contacting John Downer, an excellent sign painter in the old tradition and something of a historian of the trade.
Better yet, get your production to hire one of them as a consultant.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the replies, guys.
Aluminum - I'm talking about sign manufacturing, dimensional letters cut from wood.
Kentlew - Thank you for the input on Gill Sans, I had a feeling this would be the case. Where might I find contact information for John or Mark?

<div class=commentbody>For Mark, start here at this entertaining article : http://www.ms-studio.com/typecasting.html
Then you can find Mark's contact info via the Bio/Resume page.
John is a rather private person and not as much of a web denizen. I'll alert him to this thread and see if he would be willing to be contacted.
