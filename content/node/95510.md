    Inc., its progenitors, successors and assigns:\r\n\r\nPlease provide this forum
    with total gross sales figures from all fonts originally created by himself,\r\nduring
    any three-year period from 2000 through 2012, your choice. This is the number
    I seek.\r\n\r\nSecond, please inform me of the legal maneuvers I must undergo
    in order to liberate all fonts bearing the suffix NF from your control;\r\n\r\nWhereupon,
    remove all of the same from any and every website under your control.\r\n\r\nCompliance
    is optional, of course; however, any and all responses MUST be posted both in
    this forum, in this thread, and in writing, protected by Registered Mail, to my
    address of record, known to all.\r\n\r\nAs you sow, so shall ye reap."

    redacted]\r\n8/11/12\r\n\r\nRussell,\r\n\r\nWell, if I give away the store, you
    might be in for a heap of trouble.\r\n\r\nCurrent pricing methods place the value
    of the collection at $225,00-300,000 if untarnished. Obviously, the money would
    be nice, but a tax deduction would be, too.\r\n\r\nGiving it away would require
    an administrator to distribute a certain number of fonts to schools and universities
    with type design programs, with the idea of lettering students improve and add
    to the products as they see fit. Ideally, other designers could serve as guest
    mentors/lecturers in their geographical areas, if they choose. The finished products
    would then be amalgamated into a new collection, with a LUV prefix. These fonts
    would then be \"given\" away as \"free with purchase\" incentives for any foundry
    wishing to use them as such. Of course, the latter plan would require some additional
    revenue stream, which has been difficult without a single AI guru's help.\r\n\r\nOh,
    well: you were intrigued, and a guy can dream.\r\n\r\nKeep the faith, bro.\r\n\r\nNick</em>\r\n"

    to reveal certain numbers, but not sales figures of individual products. \r\n\r\nFor
    example, it made news this week that Apple (a publicly-traded company) revealed
    sales of iPod Touches for the first time, a number that they'd kept secret for
    years."

  body: "So, I dont understand, are you trying to get all your fonts back from Monotype?
    \ I don't know how this would really help you out.  Honestly it will probably
    just piss off a potential buyer.  Why don't you contact them and see if they are
    interested in owning them outright instead of just making them angry at you?  Then
    if they show no interest, then you can bring in the hardcore 'ok then give me
    all of them back' strategy.\r\n\r\nOf course maybe that's not what you're doing."

  body: "@Ryan Maelhorn\u2014\r\n\r\nThe only fonts I am \"trying to get back\" from
    Monotype are the ITC fonts; so far, the MyFonts folks have been treating me very
    well, and Bitstream better than most.\r\n\r\nI believe what I said is that I want
    a figure for the market value of my inventory, at which time, I will pull all
    of the fonts over which I have proprietary rights, then assign those rights to
    an independent trust, which will in turn distribute them to learning institutions
    as described previously. In other words...\r\n\r\n1. Set a market value, then
    2. Liquidate my holdings. Capisce?"
