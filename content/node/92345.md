body: Is there a term for typefaces such as [[http://www.blambot.com/font_wizardspeak.shtml|Wizardspeak]]
  from Blambot, or their acclaimed Lovecraft's Diary (no longer available from them,
  unfortunately, even if, presumably in violation of the license, it's floating around
  a lot of the free font sites), or the Cthulhu Runes font by [[http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/omega/omega.htm|Omega
  Font Labs]] and so on and so forth?

  body: <strong>Pseudo-alphabet</strong>  is properly descriptive; on the other hand,
    <strong>pseudo-abecedaria</strong> is less formally correct, but more analagous
    in a stylistic sense.

  body: "I use \"con-script\" (hyphenated to avoid terminological warfare :-) which
    is short for \"constructed script\". It sort of comes from the -generally accepted-
    \"conlang\" (\"constructed language\").\r\n\r\nBTW, here's one I recently made
    a font for (not featured on the site though):\r\nhttp://shwa.org/\r\nIn fact I've
    sort of become a go-to guy for weird shtuff...\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/76536\r\nMust've

  body: "I might say these sorts of fonts are more of a <em>faux</em> con-script as
    their main purpose is to <em>look</em> like an alien language, which works just
    as well if you mash your keyboard for nonsense. \r\nWhile you can use them as
    a substitution cipher for English (or whatever language of the Latin alphabet
    is that of the writer and/or reader), which is <em>technically</em> an English
    con-script and allows readers to decode it, the intent is still to represent in
    its fictional framework a language which is not English and does not sound like
    English when spoken aloud.\r\n\r\nYou can see that the Blambot site categorizes
    them as symbol fonts. This might seem like throwing two categories together for
    convenience, but it's hard to say there's a clear line to be drawn: I've seen
    Wingdings used in comics to represent an unknown language."

    So I would go for a variant of what Nick said: pseudo-script.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
