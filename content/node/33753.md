    Max Bold</a> is very similar. Could be a customized version. Also looks like a
    [[Hubert Jocham]] to me. '

  body: "Sounds fairly similar to a veto medium to me.\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/13926/vetomedium-font.html\r\n\r\nor
    maybe a regular \"bolded\".\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/13924/vetoregular-font.html\r\n(which
    would explain the 'squareness' of the \"o\")\r\n\r\nIt's apparently also going
    as Evo BQ(on myfonts for example)(it seems to me as the same, but I didnt check
    closely)\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/evo-bq/\r\n\r\nEDIT: Both are
    by marco ganz(just noticed), so not a surprise they are the same(or extremely
    close)."

  body: Interesting idea, Wolf, but compare my link to <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/veto_medium/&sample_text=StatiolHydro&sample_size=60">Veto</a>
    and you'll see Veto's shapes are very different from the logo. The logos rounds
    are very square. Compare the 'S', 'd', and 'o'.

    ff max)\r\n(the 'l' too, but I'm inclined to think that 'l' was really modified)\r\n"
