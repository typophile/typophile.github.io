body: Would any of you be interested in the creation of a special interest discussion
  forum here pertaining to copyright protection and related issues? <BR> <BR>I think
  that, given the lack of protection in the U.S. &#40;as compared to the rest of Western
  Civilization&#41;, it&#39;s an important issue.  I&#39;ve also noticed a complexity
  &#40;where legal protection issues are concerned&#41; in type design that seems
  to be unequalled in other fields&#42;--personally, I think it&#39;s up to us to
  clarify some issues that may be confusing to the powers that be...  and I certainly
  think we&#39;re capable.   <BR> <BR>We&#39;ve got a real opportunity as a community,
  and of course I&#39;d try to get the TypeRight people onboard in some fashion too.
  <BR> <BR>Let me know what all of you think. <BR> <BR>&#42;People have no difficulty
  understanding that if someone writes a novel, it&#39;s totally their intellectual
  property; they get confused, however, not only by the act of someone defining their
  interpretation of the alphabet, but the finer details of type design as well &#40;metrics,
  etc.&#41;.
