  design student at the esdi, rio de janeiro, brazil. <BR> <BR>i discovered this typography
  forum a week ago, when i was searching for information on bitmap-fonts... and i
  found it fantastic, i always wanted to have this kind of space to discuss work still
  in progress... <BR> <BR>so, i&#39;m finally placing something here: this font is
  called &#39;gentileza&#39; and is inpired by writings of a wandering &#39;prophet&#39;
  in some walls in rio. the prophet&#39;s name, gentileza, means kindness; all his
  messages were about living as brothers, loving one another a.s.o... <BR> <BR>the
  normal font is based on a photographic reproduction of one of his walls; the italics,
  on a sample of his hand-drawn lettering. the numbers, punctuation and some characters
  &#40;k, w, y&#41; were artificially generated with pieces of other letters. <BR>
  <BR>so, enough talking, here they are: <BR> <BR>normal <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1440.gif"
  ALT="gentileza.gif"> <BR> <BR>italic <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1441.gif"
  ALT="gentileza-i.gif">'

    feel is a welcome change from so much cold digitally-based design stuff these
    days. this definitely conveys an interesting personality. '

  body: thanks for the comments... <BR> <BR>this post is just to complement the information
    i provided before about this font... <BR> <BR>as i said, this font is a tribute
    to the prophet gentileza, the old man shown on the picture below... <BR> <BR><IMG

    <BR> <BR>he used to write his messages with a brush on the walls with in a certain
    color scheme, creating a style which became his mark.

  body: 'Hey I just LOOVE this alphabet! This is exactly the kind of typography that
    is currently seen as out of fashion? not very useful? not functional? in short:
    it&#39;s too human for its own baseline! <BR>It&#39;s a pity that with so few
    responses to these fonts&#39; posts, designers sometimes foolishly sway into the
    tricky realms of the &#34;hip&#34; &#40;read pix or &#34;extreme&#34; fonts&#41;.
    <BR>10000 thumbs up, you had to be from latinamerica, pal. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Go
    and release this letters commercially right now &#40;needs some tips? send me
    an email&#41; and make some money for your good taste. <BR>its an OOORRRDDEERR!!'
