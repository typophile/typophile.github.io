    i also remember these spreads back from 3 years ago. these display fonts were
    big and i remember seeing similar looking ones by other designers as well. why
    don't you make your own? with esen karol of bilgi university we have created our
    own but not all the letters were drawn so it's uncomplete. email me so i can send
    you our sketches."
