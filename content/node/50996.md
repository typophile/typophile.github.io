  collecting innovative iPhone apps for <a href=\"http://www.idlemode.com\">Punchcut's
  mobile design blog, Idlemode</a>. This game, Anaconda, a remake of Snake for iPhone
  never made it to Idlemode, but the artwork concept for the blog illustration was
  a fun challenge. Each glyph is drawn in the game of course creating a version of
  game play that only a Typophile could appreciate.\r\n\r\nDownload <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=288530657&mt=8\">Anaconda
  for iPhone</a>, it's free.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
