body: "Hi everyone...\r\n\r\nI have a question, and sorry, it's not really a small
  one. I shall number them, I guess different people might know one or two, so quoting
  a number might be the best thing to do. \r\n\r\nFor a design-research on typo used
  in fashion magazines, Im looking for the actual typefaces (or perhaps modified originals)
  of the following logos:\r\n\r\n(Many, many thanks in advance! Any help and tips
  really appreciated.)\r\n\r\n1. Miracle\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MIRACLE_3749.jpg]\r\n\r\n2.

      designs... Is there no way of tracing that back to an original font?\r\n\r\nthanks

    body: "Hi Nick,\r\n\r\nSorry for the previous post if it looks a bit strange.\r\n\r\nehm,
      I cannot imagine that the 'custom fonts' are so totally 'unique' that we can
      state there is no historic model where the font is based on...\r\n\r\nI'm only
      hoping to find maybe some more 'links' en 'gestures' which point to (almost)
      similar fonts, it's like tracing back the origins of the 'custom designs'...\r\n\r\n(hope
      this does make sense)\r\n\r\nbest,\r\nMatthijs"

  body: Oops Edward, you're right, now I remember. Serves me right for being too lazy
    to look them up. Then again, Matthijs might've done that himself; dunno why we
    would have to look stuff up for him if the information is readily available online...

    should I admit that when <cite>Thief III</cite> came out, I hated the new system
