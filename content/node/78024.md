body: "Probably this is an easy one.\r\n\r\nFor the very first time I am trying to
  add Central European diacritics for a font I am designing. I am using the new encodings
  that appear in FontLab Studio if you have installed Fontographer 5 (either the full
  version or the demo). I am using the encoding called \u201COpenType LatPro\u201D.\r\n\r\nI
  did some readings online and watched some fonts who include the glyphs proposed
  by this encoding and so far I think I am doing right, but I am unable to find what
  is commaccent.salt for. \r\n\r\nI have read at [[http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=9|typo.cz]]
  that \u201CIn Latvian, the use of cedilla is wrong, the correct shape of the accent
  is a small comma under letter. Both for technical and aesthetic reasons, the comma
  accent is drawn above the lower case \u0123, rotated by 180 degrees\u201D, and I
  am aware about Adam Twardoch\u2019s recommendations quoted on that same page regarding
  Scedilla, scedilla, S with commaaccent, s with commaaccent, T with cedilla, t with
  cedilla, T with commaaccent, and t with commaaccent. Everything clear, but I still
  don\u2019t know what to put inside the commaccent.salt slot. Any help appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/commaccentsalt_6577.png]"

  body: 'The commaaccent.salt slot is indeed intended for the 180-degree rotated commaaccent
    which is to be placed above g. The caron.salt is intended for the "upright-acute"/"apostrophe-shaped"
    variant of caron, intended for use with d, t, l and L. '

  body: "Thank you Adam. That was exactly my thought, since uni0123 (\u0123) is the
    only character that presents a variant for commaaccent, but I just wanted to be
    sure. And it is good to know that I was right about the caron.salt.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: 'Indeed, there is only one character that uses commaaccent.salt, yet it''s
    still useful to make it into a component, and make uni0123 a composite glyph primarily
    so that the "g" glyph is a component, which makes things like hinting easier. '

  body: "Thank you for you clarification, Adam. Useful as always.\r\n\r\nThere is
    one other small thing I am curious about this encoding \u2013 not a problem, just
    wanna know the story behind the inclusion of the longs_t ligature. It is unrelated
    with this thread, so it will be better to start a [[http://typophile.com/node/78090|new
    one.]] Hope you can answer me that one, too. Thanks in advance."

  body: I am usually rotating the composite commaaccent, aligning the bottom with
    a dot on i. It works and you do not need an extra glyph.

  body: "Kristians, \r\n\r\nThere are, of course, many ways to achieve a certain goal.
    Having an extra glyph is the simplest solution, and works well with various automatic
    glyph-creation mechanisms. Also, it works with all tools. Rotated components may
    work with some font-creation tools, but may not work with others. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"
