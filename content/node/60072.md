  body: Assemble an animated GIF of the appropriate dimensions and file size and upload.
    If you have the Adobe CS then you probably have Fireworks which makes animated
    GIFs easily, but there are lots of other programs that do it too.

  body: Yes, that it does. You may need to reduce the color pallet and/or frame count
    to achieve that.
