body: "I've looked everywhere for this, online, old type specimen books and I simply
  can't recognize it.\r\n\r\nA letterpress printer friend of mine suggested it could
  be a customisation on Windsor or Hallamshire Old Style, but I think it maybe quite
  a big customisation for a book binder.\r\n\r\nThe book was published in London,
  around 1924.\r\n\r\nAny help on this is much appreciated,"
