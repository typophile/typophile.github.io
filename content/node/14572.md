  usual design community... hence the guys that always critique my work.\r\n\r\nI
  ran across this place-of-joyfull-&-merry-meet___I believe I'll stay... if you allow
  it.\r\n\r\nI'm needing some input on a logo design. More like, post-commentary since
  it has already been approved. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: My only problem with you logo is when your client has to make out the check.
    Is it Decals.com or is it TSEB Decals. Make sure your clients know which it is.

  body: "Perhaps if you just slightly curl the upper left corner of the logo, it might
    be enough of a visual clue of a decal being pealed back.\r\n"

  body: "I read TSEB initially as well. Perhaps mirror 'best' as a whole rather than
    letter-by-letter.\r\n\r\nAlso, adding the extra 'dot' in the middle isn't a great
    idea if it's supposed to act as a URL.\r\n\r\nAs for one-stop decal shop, are
    there decal shops that require multiple tops? \r\n\r\nI like norberts idea, too."
