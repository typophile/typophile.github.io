  passage in Patricia Cornwell's latest book <em>The Scarpetta Factor</em>:\r\n\r\n\"...you
  should pay attention to fonts, like I've told you how many times? Fonts are part
  of the twenty-first-century documents examination, and you ignore them at your own
  peril. What they are and why someone might pick them for a specific communication
  can be telling and significant.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe I can get a job with CSI as a font
  forensic examiner :)"

    I think it''s more tenable an idea, since people choose fonts, where they don''t

    spot than post mortem examination.\r\n\r\nThough I find \"font forensics\" during
    pre-digital era more viable and intriguing since setting type was less accessible
    to the masses and sources more identifiable. \r\n\r\nThe font in question in <em>The
    Scarpetta Factor</em> was Gotham -- just think of how many knock-offs and pirated
    copies are out now since the Obama presidential campaign."
