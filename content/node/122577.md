body: "We are a professional design agency and currently we have a big font-library
  of thousands of fonts that we gathered of the last 10+ years including all the (valuable)
  classics.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are facing the problem that we can\u2019t verify if
  we have the licenses for all of these fonts and if they were obtained legally. We
  are searching for a smart and \u201Cbudget-friendly\u201D way to license the fonts
  that we are not sure about or to \u201Crefresh\u201D our whole font-library.\r\n\r\nWe
  need a font-library for at least 15 users , web and desktop, and it is very important
  that they are suitable for making press files by embedding the fonts in certified-pdf\u2019s.\r\n\r\nWe
  can use Typekit by Adobe because of our CC-licenses but we noticed that is doesn\u2019t
  have most of the classic 'must-have' fonts like Helvetica, Garamond, etc. and we\u2019re
  not sure if Typekit is suited for certified-pdf. \r\n\r\nBuying individual font-licenses
  or entire font-libraries like Linotype, Monotype or ITC is very costly. We don\u2019t
  have any experience with subscriptions for online-libraries like font.com. Are these
  fonts waterproof for embedding in press files?\r\n\r\nIn summery: How can we legally
  and budget-friendly refresh our font-library and do people have experience with
  online libraries via a monthly subscription via for example fonts.com? Are these
  types of online-font-libraries suited for online use and desktop by embedding in
  certified-pdf\u2019s.\r\n\r\nYou could help us a lot with your advice. Thanks! :)\r\n"
