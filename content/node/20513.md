body: Can this be done? I have a disc full of commercial and linotype font faces that
  i want to bring to work. Problem is, we use PCs at work. Can LWFNs be converted
  to a stable useable file format that works on a P.C.? If so, what program would
  do this for me?

    body: I downloaded TransType before i posted here. I tried adding all of the fonts
      i want converted into the program by having it scan the CD they were on but
      it couldn't bring them over into the program. I figured it might create a list
      of the fonts i want to be converted in the program and then i'd just select
      the output settings in the preferences and hit 'Convert'. But it won't bring
      them into TransType. Am i doing something wrong?

    PC to Mac and Mac to PC. The Trick of Mac to PC is to use a PC Formated disk (Floppy,
    ZIP, Harddrive, etc) and convert from Mac to PC formated disk. Easy as pie.\r\n\r\nRodi\r\n
