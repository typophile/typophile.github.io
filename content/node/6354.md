  body: ' Actually, I have seen things like this, but not in font form. <BR> <BR>I
    know of CD collections with company logos in EPS and/or TIFF format. You&#39;d
    probably have more luck looking for these through stock photography/clip art outlets
    than through typefoundries. You also may find that it&#39;s more cost-effective
    to license only the logos you need rather than the entire CD, where offered, but
    this of course would depend on your specific needs. <BR> <BR>Good luck. I hope
    this helps. <BR> <BR>David '
