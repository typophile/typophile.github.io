  body: the first one, with the Lego logo spoof... <BR> <BR>you might want to revise
    and connect your shirt <BR>somehow to type or this site. I dunno, we&#39;re critiquing
    right. <BR> <BR>as far as Lego&#39;s intellectual property, and appropriating
    it... <BR>i think we know what road that leads to. <BR> <BR>just my opinion. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>&#62; that&#39;s a question the designer cannot answer. <BR> <BR>Anonymously,
    he could. Wow, there&#39;s a usefulness to allowing anonymity after all... <BR>
