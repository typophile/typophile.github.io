  body: "I'm glad someone was able to articulate what was wrong with this book. But
    there was also stuff right with it.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed it as entertainment; it seemed
    to me that the brief of the book was to popularise type design \u2014 an arcane
    abstraction to most people, and a funky hobby for dilettantes. Personally I think
    it's a good thing to bring type design into the consciousness of the masses, as
    it's a massively invisible industry. I'd even say it's slightly worth sacrificing
    factual accuracy to make it tangible to those who've never stopped to consider
    that every fullstop they've ever seen has been shaped by a real person.\r\n\r\nAt
    the same time, I did find the book irritating in glossing over/joking about type
    designers' valid perspectives. I wrote to the editor with factual corrections,
    which I've never done before. Mixing up Haas Unica and Helvetica is just careless.\r\n\r\nThere
    was some event here a while back where Simon Garfield was doing readings from
    the book \u2014 it seemed very much an \xABamuse-bouche\xBB \u2014 for people
    who knew enough to laugh at Comic Sans, but not enough to get over it. For me
    it's an oversimplified view of a select few issues, and I'm glad it didn't pretend
    to be a serious essay. \r\n\r\nThere's a whole lot more to the story than Simon
    uncovered, but I think on balance I'm glad it exists to pique people's interest
    in an undiscovered topic. I sort of hope there won't be a sequel, though."

    they've never considered before. Detailed research might not be very accessible

    they are done and facts sorted out. Really he could have given the manuscript
    to anybody a bit competent and have dealt with quite a lot of what is wrong. No,
    this was a quick rush for some money or carelessness or both. This isn't a case
    of mere "enthusiasm".

  body: "I read Garfield's book last night. Yes, there are a few groaners and boners.
    But overall I think Shaw's criticisms are a bit sour and persnickety. \r\n\r\nAs
    Shaw concedes, \"This is a book that the uninitiated will find enthralling and
    entertaining.\" There you have it. It may be true that someone \"who actually
    know[s] something about type design \u2026 will find it maddening.\" But the book
    wasn't written for them. It's hardly sporting to criticize Garfield for satisfying
    his target audience \u2014 readers with a casual interest in typography \u2014\_at
    the expense of sophisticated readers. No book can be all things to all people.
    Nobody criticizes Angry Birds for its unrealistic physics.\r\n\r\nTo me, any book
    that introduces readers to the pleasures of typography is a good book, and ultimately
    makes life better for every professional typographer and type designer. Garfield's
    book was reviewed by Janet Maslin in the New York Times. He wrote an opinion piece
    for the Wall Street Journal. So it's getting a lot of good press and selling a
    lot of copies. You may think that's extrinsic to the merits of the book. I don't.
    I think that's a compliment to Garfield specifically, and a ratification generally
    of how far typography has come in the public consciousness.\r\n\r\nIn the book,
    Matthew Carter says jokingly that 20 years ago, he still preferred to tell people
    he was a brain surgeon to avoid explaining type design for the umpteenth time.
    But these days, people know that type and type designers exist. Of course, you
    often hear \"You do typography? That's so cool! I love Helvetica!\" (or \"I love
    <em>Helvetica</em>!\") But you've got to start somewhere. I'd rather start there,
    than with brain surgery.\r\n\r\nI agree with Shaw's point that the book doesn't
    do much to tie together its anecdotes. I'll go a step further and say that it's
    editorially haphazard. In the first 30 pages, Garfield's main topic is Steve Jobs,
    then Comic Sans, then Gutenberg. It keeps jumping around from there. (Though maybe
    that's the intended gist of the title \u2014\_by \"Just My Type,\" Garfield means
    \"Just The Things About Type That I, Simon Garfield, Am Interested In\")\r\n\r\nSimilar
    problem with level of detail. Garfield doesn't achieve a consistent tone \u2014\_one
    page he's conducting a breezy tour of typography, the next he's on a detailed
    digression into some microtopic.  This book \u2014\_and this is true of most nonfiction
    books \u2014\_would've benefited from one more round of editing and rewriting.\r\n\r\nBut
    would I recommend the book to casual readers? Sure. In the end I don't think these
    criticisms are showstoppers because the book doesn't ask to be read start to finish.
    You're supposed to take what interests you and leave the rest, and then pass it
    along to a friend. Whether Garfield's book recruits another 50 people or 50,000
    people into the typography army, that's great for typography."

  body: "I'll probably get this out of the library, as I'm cheap and it doesn't look
    like something I'd want to keep around for reference. It sounds like it has both
    the virtues and the vices of much contemporary journalism. I agree with Matthew
    that we should appreciate the virtues, namely that it is extremely well written,
    in the sense of being easy and fun to read. I know this is no easy feat, and one
    which I as a writer respect and admire.  \r\n\r\nBut while good and entertaining
    writing is a great achievement, it to my mind doesn't excuse the vices which this
    book has, judging by Paul Shaw's review, and knowing that Paul is an extraordinarily
    knowledgeable scholar of type. Some journalists have thought it was important
    to get it right. In fact, for many was a matter of principle, a first duty. \r\n\r\nI
    think it is really regrettable that this ethic of journalism has been abandoned
    by many, including evidently Mr. Garfield. It is evident to me that neither he
    nor his publisher bothered to have this vetted by an expert such as Shaw. Then
    he could have easily avoided outright blunders. If it was vetted and the reviewer
    didn't catch the blunders, then my apologies to Mr. Garfield and his publisher.
    But this does seem a case of abandoning the best traditions of journalism, which
    I am sad to see. "

  body: "+1 to butterick's comment\r\n\r\nLook, any book with blatant inaccuracies
    - innacuracies easily spotted and fixed, too - hasn't earned its purchase price.
    And any reviewer would be obligated to point them out.\r\n\r\nWhat's significant
    is that a book with \"fonts\" in the title would sell pretty well. At least from
    what I hear.\r\n\r\nThe idea that what around here usually gets called a typeface
    but the rest of the world calls a font has penetrated the consciousness of the
    average person is kind of revolutionary in the sense that a page in history has
    turned.\r\nIf Butterick's book is selling decently - and I certainly hope so -
    it's a piggy-back ride on the same social development.\r\n\r\n&emsp;&loz;&ensp;A
    couple of years ago, while watching an episode of the TV\r\n&emsp;&emsp;series
    <em>House</em>, there was a scene between House and his oncologist\r\n&emsp;&emsp;friend
    (the 'Watson' character - his name is escaping me)\r\n&emsp;&emsp;which included
    a snappy comeback line in response to something\r\n&emsp;&emsp;House said:\"What
    did you do? Use a different font?\"\r\n\r\n&emsp;&emsp;A line like that in a hit
    TV series was unthinkable\r\n&emsp;&emsp;until recently. If the line was \"What
    did you do? Change the\r\n&emsp;&emsp;typeface?\" no viewer would have had a frame
    of reference for it.\r\n\r\nThere's clearly a change in meaning and perception
    regarding type and typography that is unprecedented."
