  body: "Well, I'm not really a graphic designer (I just make fonts) so I was just
    keeping quiet, hoping from input from the pros (which I think you'll probably
    get, eventually). But I <em>do</em> enjoy giving my opinion :-) so here it goes:\r\n\r\nI
    think it's very nice. It's simple without being boring, and the shapes seem to
    nicely fit what the company does. Of those four fonts (all of which make sense
    actually) I like NeoSans the most and Bourgeois the least.\r\n\r\nColors: I don't
    do colors.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Could you try a lighter weight Klavika? And maybe give it some more space
    to breath (line height).\r\n\r\nI like the mark although I think you can tweak
    the flag a bit more to make it even better.\r\n\r\nIn general: don't make gradients
    an essential part of your brand. I don't really like the colors. The blue one
    I like the most. Maybe a yellow?"

      You're right, gradients shouldn't be an essential part of the brand (I think
      the one-color version of the logo works without a gradient though, no?).\r\nI
      like the blue version too because it works well on light/dark backgrounds (I
      feel yellow looks less elegant on light backgrounds).\r\n\r\n- I tried the lighter
      weight <strong>Klavika</strong> and it doesn't look bad. The way I see it, <strong>Trade
      Gothic</strong> and <strong>DIN</strong> was too dry with no personality, <strong>Bourgeois</strong>
      seems fitting and has personality but there is something unsettling about it
      (it gives a \"1984 Big Brother\" type of vibe), <strong>Benton Sans</strong>
      has more personality than the usual generic corporate fonts, but it feels too
      \"deja-vu\", and <strong>Klavika</strong> sends a subtle \"Facebook vibe\" that
      says \u201Chello I\u2019m here!\u201D a little too loud. Moreover, I feel that
      square sans-serifs in the vein of Klavika are very commonplace in the corporate
      arena. <strong>Neo Sans</strong> feels futuristic and clean without being too
      angular, and its curves contrast with the 90 degree angles in the logo directly
      above it, hopefully creating a nice tension:\r\n\r\n- Do you have any tips on
      how I can further tweak the flag?"

    an optical illusion you'll have have to compensate for: for the vertical lines
    of the \"M\" to appear as thick are the horizontal lines of the \"F\", they can't
    be mathematically equal, they have to be thicker.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yea, I don't see 'EFM' either. I see FIII with a flag. I don't know if that's
    an issue or not. \r\n\r\nIt's a nice geometric logo. The flat versions have a
    bit of an 80's vibe to it, but that's not necessarily bad. It's solid. And the
    gradient versions are a nice use of a gradient."
