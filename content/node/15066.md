body: "Hello, I'm new to Typophile, I've been reading this forum and found great comments
  and ideas, great professionals around. I would like to know if you could help me
  with some ideas about a logo I'm designing for a client.\r\n\r\nThe company name
  is \"Neo Trends\", it's the merge of 3 textile companies (all of them from Peru),
  the new company (also in Peru), is dedicated to making apparel for different clothing
  brands in Peru and USA markets.\r\n\r\nThe company now wants to expand its operations
  with the new brand, they are not a clothing brand, they make clothing for other
  brands (directly or via brokers), they need the logo to express they are a solid
  company, that they can fulfill and deliver on time, that their work is high quality
  and they are forward thinking.\r\n\r\nI have come with some initial ideas, some
  of them I like the most, some of them I just draw and after looking at them I thought
  \"ouch, that's ugly\", but I included them so I can get more feedback from the client
  (although I'm not sure this was a good idea after all, he has liked one of the ideas
  I hate :) )\r\n\r\nI'm also in a situation when the client thinks that he \"will
  know which one is the correct logo once he sees it\", I'm worried about this because
  I could be making lots of logos until I get the \"correct\" logo, so far my client
  feedback hasn't been so good, just comments like \"I like # 5 but you could work
  more on it\", \"# 7 is interesting\", very basic feedback as you see.\r\n\r\nA quick
  note: they make any kind of clothing, not only t-shirts, but t-shirts is a great
  part of their business.\r\n\r\nI would love to know your comments about dealing
  with undecided clients and what you think about these logo ideas:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ventanazul.com/~clientsection/neotrends/neotrends/logos-5.gif\">logos
  v2</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ventanazul.com/~clientsection/neotrends/neotrends/logos-6.gif\">logos
  v3</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ventanazul.com/~clientsection/neotrends/neotrends/logos-7.gif\">logos
  v4</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ventanazul.com/~clientsection/neotrends/neotrends/logos-8.gif\">logos
  v5</a>\r\n\r\n(I'm not including logos v1, they were very basic ideas and most of
  them were discarded by myself)\r\n\r\nThank you very much!"

  body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t design type or logos, but I am involved in aspects
    of cover design, so here\u2019s my opinion:\r\nI liked a couple of the ones in
    logos V3 -- #2 and #4. I quite liked the triangle shape of #2 \u2013 to me it
    shows direction and stability. #4 reminds me of a needle and thread and also provides
    direction. \r\n\r\nI emphatically dislike the arched dotted lines in logos V4.\r\n\r\nSeveral
    in logos V5 I liked: #3, 6, 7. Numbers 6 and 7 make me think of a bolt of fabric,
    and also show direction and movement. The angle or skew on #1 and 2 of V5 don\u2019t
    seem as effective, and overall I think I wouldn\u2019t separate \u201Cneo\u201D
    from \u201Ctrends\u201D...\r\nSo, I\u2019m voting for #2 in V3 or #6 or 7 in V5.
    \r\n\r\nKristina"

  body: "Hi Kristina, thank you very much for your very helpful comments.\r\n\r\nI
    agree the words \"neo\" and \"trends\" work better together, the company name
    uses an space between them and I'm not quite sure as to how treat them in the
    logo, in some versions I put the words together and used bold or other value for
    \"neo\" but I'm not sure if that allows the viewer to recognize an space. I'm
    open to any suggestion about that point.\r\n\r\nI do like the triangle shape but
    I'm not sure how to relate it to the logo brief, or could I be so abstract and
    just focus in direction and stability?\r\n\r\nDirection is a very important part
    of this design, Neo Trends, as I said before, has put together 3 companies and
    they intend to enter new markets and use new strategies to grow their business,
    they are taking a new direction indeed.\r\n\r\nThis business depends a lot in
    delivery times, if some brand needs to launch their summer season on a particular
    date the company in charge of making the clothing must be able to deliver on time
    and with good quality, trust is also very important and the logo should present
    a reliable company.\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert in type, my focus is in web oriented
    design, so I would love to know (besides your opinions about the logos) what you
    think about my font selections or if you would suggest any other fonts.\r\n\r\nThank
    you very much for your help.\r\n\r\nAlexis Bellido"

    ones. Just an idea, but you may want to look at scissors or a needle, measuring
    tape (or whateva its called). Personally I think the equipment would reflect the
    job that they do.\r\nJust an idea...\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "I like the logos in v5 best, especially #6. In #7, 'trends' is too close
    to the nice fibers/threads for my taste. Also, if you put the two words into two
    lines, I am not sure if alignment to the right is the best option (at least if
    you use an italic or slanted typeface, where the combination of 'o' and 's' at
    the ends of the lines makes the logo look as if it would tilt to the right in
    the next second).\r\nJust another thought: Perhaps you could extend the fibers
    part on the left to give it more direction and to include a triangular shape symbolizing
    the 3 companies? "

  body: "I like V7 #3 and #4. \r\n\r\nFor V7 #3, I like how everything is contained
    in a black shape. It feesls stable and complete. But I think that the dashed line
    (I am guessing that it's stitching) should be closer to \"neo trends.\" In #3,
    it's way too far away, and looks as if it wants to escape. It should be closer,
    like it is in #4.\r\n\r\nI very much like V8 #7. The waves look like fabric, texture,
    fibers, and move in unison. It feels approachable and still pretty stable. Go
    with the logo that's all black. #8, where it's grey and black is too much."

    would like to get some more feedback from other members and then I will talk to
    my client.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the undecided client issue?, the problem
    of \"I will know the logo I like when I see it\", to give you some idea, one of
    the ideas the client liked most was v3 #5 which I really think I didn't have to
    include, I don't see any meaning on it.\r\n\r\nRegards!\r\n\r\nAlexis Bellido"

  body: "Hmm, just thinking about your client situation... \r\n\r\nSometimes I put
    myself into trouble by showing a client too many versions. They don't know what
    to choose! \r\n\r\nEven though your client claims that he will \"know it when
    he sees it,\" I feel as if that is just a thinly veiled way of saying \"I don't
    know what I want.\"\r\n\r\nWhen clients are undecided, they sometimes have a tendency
    of doing the mix-and-match with your versions. You know, they want you to use
    this part of V1, that part of V3, and combine with V8\u2014totally destroying
    your concepts. \r\n\r\nIf you are still having trouble with a pesky client, perhaps
    show them one or two and revise as needed."

  body: "I'd say the most interesting are in v5. However, I think the shape is hindering
    the organic nature of what could potentially become your logomark.\r\n\r\nI would
    explore the movement of shapes you have more. Forget about the type, for now,
    and explore. Keep textiles and fabrics in your mind as you do. The way a fabric
    drapes or a weave catches light.\r\n\r\nOnce you have some solid textile studies
    -- what I see them as -- you can then consider how type should or shouldn't interact
    with it.\r\n\r\nI like v5-2 -- the textile study -- the mostl."

  body: "You mention the three into one which may be combined with the textile/weaving
    images that could be refined into a distinctive image, bearing in mind the <a
    href=\"http://www.mlm.com.au/work/miniwoolmark/index.html\">woolmark</a> logo
    as a direction to be avoided.\r\nThe problem with a client who \u2018knows what
    they want when they see it\u2019 is a situation that may be resolved by showing/verbalising
    a single (not necessarily resolved) concept.\r\nIt is often the case that a client
    cannot visualise a concept even when presented by runouts, so if you reinforce
    your presentation with a paragraph or two explaining your thinking and show their
    logo in use on stationery, packaging, vans, clothing (if applicable) etc. Help
    the client become confident about the logo.\r\nTim"

  body: What will help you with direction is look at the end use of the logo, labels,
    signage even print applications. As yourself how will it be used will it be stiched
    into clothing or only screened on labels. End use will dictate how intricate or
    simple your mark will have to be. One company I've delt with as a customer Is
    Road Runners Sport. In the beginning they had the full name and a bird (Road Runner)
    as their mark. Over time they have dropped the bird logo and the full name and
    are now RRS and sometimes a big R with Road KOed out of it with Runner below it.

    some fabric photos to see how I can play with that concept further.\r\n\r\nI will
    also prepare a revision including just the 3 or 4 ideas you have helped me to
    find and will show to the client.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other suggestion I will

    on it early, you have put a constraintive and limiting element into all the concepts.\r\n\r\nAnd
    as someone else mentioned, don't show too many versions to the client - especially
    the ones you couldn't bear to have to work up into final treatments. Pick three
    that you can \"defend\" with a thorough rationale that describes why they are
    the best solutions.\r\n\r\ngood luck\r\n\r\npd"
