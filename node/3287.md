    Tuscon connection didn&#39;t cross his mind. <BR> <BR>Mr. Chau - I&#39;m in love
    with Tuscon Squot. Nice work.  <BR>The &#39;Q&#39; does create some problems when
    it touches <BR>the following glyph. <BR> <BR>Out of curiosity, are you in cahoots
    with Miguel H.? <BR>Back in April he <A HREF="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/1906.html?"
    TARGET="_top">mentioned</A> something about doing <BR>a set of western pixel fonts.
    <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re not in cahoots, you should get so. Your <BR>individual
    streams of bitmap talent call for a confluence.

  body: ' Dave - for want of a better phrase - it&#39;s all good. Keep developing
    this idea. Do think about the origins of such fonts though; they were fonts for
    posters and were rarely used at sizes less than, say, 72 point. If you can make
    bitmap versions with flavor then go for it, but the richness of these design ideas
    you have really should be manifested in vector fonts. '
