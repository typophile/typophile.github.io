body: Can anyone on typophile suggest a suite of fonts to fit a brief in which arabic,
  english and hebrew versions of a title need to be in successive frames. They can
  all be compatible in terms of weight and stroke contrst, or the arabic and hebrew
  can be conflicting / contrasting with the latin script font stylistically transitioning
  between the two?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]
