body: "I have a font in progress that has Latin and Hebrew classes set up and realize
  that after creating kerning pairs and compiling the kern feature they all fall under
  the kern feature without a specific script to separate the two and designate the
  Hebrew as hebr.\r\n\r\nI don't know too much about all of this so bear with me.\r\n\r\nI'm
  basically trying to figure out how to separate the two kerning features and designate
  the Hebrew script within the kern feature without having to do it manually?\r\n\r\nCan
  someone please advise how to handle this, and what I need to look into to learn
  for future reference when dealing with non-Latin languages?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
