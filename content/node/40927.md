    for my paper\", do you mean a kind of paper, or a particular document you've written
    and must now compose?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Hi Gregorius,\r\n\r\nso you want to design a [[typeface]] and produce yourself
    a [[font]].\r\nAnd as you want to use it for type-setting your thesis, I assume
    it\u2019s about a Latin text face \u2013 right?\r\n\r\nHow many time do you have?
    You have to be aware of the fact that creating a font will take a <em>very long</em>
    time, at least if you\u2019re doing it for the first time, and if you want the
    outcome to be reasonably good and usable.\r\n\r\nGiven that setting an academic
    paper usually requires more than just one weight (e.g. Roman, Italic, Bold, maybe
    Small Caps, several sets of figures, \u2026), I strongly recommend to rethink
    your plan. You\u2019ll be better off with a little less ambitious aim. You could
    design a nice display face for titlings/headings, for example.\r\n\r\nTo answer
    your question \u2013 have a look at these older threads:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/36268\">Advice
    for a beginner</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/35134\">Type Design
    tutorial anywhere? \u2013 How to create fonts?</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/37860\">What
    books are there on type design?</a>\r\nand of course the [[How-To]] section in
    the Typophile Wiki.\r\nF"

  body: "thanks Hardwig\r\n\r\nyeah i know that creating a font need extra time. i
    won't create all of family type or characters set (ligeratures, etc) in my font,
    maybe just one family type with uppercase and/or lowercase, that's why i must
    have good concept for this decision. \r\n\r\ntruly, it's not about my ambition.
    i want to learn and experience the process of creating a font. btw, i can't change
    the topic anymore.\r\n\r\nthanks a lot for your advise, i appreciate it, and for
    those great links, it's helpful\r\n"
