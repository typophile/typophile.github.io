body: "I just wrapped up a logo design for a small business that I did for about ten
  times less than I should have. I offered to do the job for $250 because I thought
  it would be a quick wordmark for a yoga teacher, it turned out to be a three-part
  logo with a brandmark, wordmark, and an add-on workmark for a sub-brand. I was really
  busy and not sleeping much when I agreed to do the work without raising the price
  (end of semester stuff) and have a contract with the client for $250.\r\n\r\nNow
  the client is happy with the logo and wants to pay extra. The question is: do I
  tell her not to worry about it knowing that she's planning to do more business with
  me, or do I accept the extra cash even though we have a contract?"

  body: Take it as a good sign that the client wants to compensate you for the "extra"
    work... I would imagine that they're planning on using you for more work down
    the road, and this is their way of keeping you happy. It might be different if
    YOU asked, but if they're offering, for goodness' sake, take it! You'll want to
    consider raising your rate on the next job.

  body: I wouldn't take it, you have a contract and that it's priceless. But if the
    original $250 were agreed just for the logo, then you should re-arrange the contract
    if the final product exceeded what was in the agreement. Don't take it just like
    that, if applicable, make a new contract for the final product, so she will see
    that you respect your work and the contract.

  body: Some people might even be offended if you wouldn't take it. Especially in
    Oriental cultures (and it is a yoga teacher), I think it might come off as offensive
    if you wouldn't accept it... Seems like an easy choice to me. And the fact they
    want to pay extra is a sign they are pleased & will definitely want to work with
    you in the future

    this would be the perfect opportunity to charge much more via doing as Elio (ilovecolors)
    suggests. Rewrite the contract taking into account the additional services you've
    rendered.\r\nI feel your pain; that it's embarrassing to undersell yourself so
    badly that the client feels hesitant accepting on the original terms. Also, why
    am I not looking at a picture of this wordmark and logo right now? Has your Photoshop
    broken down?"

    double or triple the original bid, I don't really think it's worth it (unless
    you're really strapped for cash). \r\n\r\nNow I'm always a fan of sucking every
    last penny from a client, but I think this will end up hurting you down the road.
    It would be better to just call it good at $250, but make it clear to her that
    this was more or less a freebie with a small stipend. If she gives you $50 extra,
    she'll think that she paid you what you're worth (or whatever arbitrary number
    she comes up with). And then she'll expect those same rates down the road.\r\n\r\nProbably
    your best bet is to walk away, unless you think it would be a really great portfolio
    piece. "

  body: "I can't really offer an opinion on this one, but I have a couple of practices
    that have served me & my company well for almost 30 years.\r\n\r\n1. We have two
    prices: full price and free. Even friends can understand this one. It should go
    without saying that if it is a free job, we work just as hard as if we were getting
    full price.\r\n\r\n2. 95 % of the time, for our work -- even creative work --
    we have a price agreed on in advance. Sometime we make a little extra, sometimes
    we don't; it averages out in the long run. For that other 5% of the time when
    I come back & ask for more because of some unforeseen complexities, customers
    almost always agree. I think this is due in part to that 95% consistency; and
    in part because they too see that the extra work was needed.\r\n\r\nAnd a final
    thing: very occasionally I quote too high, yet the price is agreed to. In that
    case, similar to when I have to go back & ask for more, we bill less than the
    agreed amount. I don't view this as a change in price so much as a mistake in
    assessing the complexities of a job, just like the situation where we ask for
    more.\r\n\r\nFWIW "

    From what James said, the client recognized that the job was worth more than originally
    agreed and made the offer of more money. He didn't browbeat her into doing it.
    Sounds like a great client!\r\n\r\nIt is always good to have a contract before
    starting a job (learned the hard way) but it's also important to make clear the
    scope of the job within the contract. If the contract stipulated a wordmark and
    the job exceeded that description then you would also have been within your right
    to negotiate for additional money."
