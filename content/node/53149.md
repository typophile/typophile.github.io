  body: "Well after a little digging around on their website, I found a pdf (usually
    a good way to see what fonts are used in file>properties)...and it turns out to
    be called SainsburysBigOne. Not very imaginative for a custom font.\r\n\r\nThere
    are some alternatives listed on [[http://www.qbn.com/topics/439582/|this page]]."

    to have access I'd email their marketing team.
