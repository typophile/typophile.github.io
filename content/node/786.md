    are very nice, and the small touches, like the @ and the braces, are quite elegant. '

  body: ' Yeah. I like it too and I agree with John about the small touches, the @
    was especially nice.  <BR>The uppercase Q could need some minor optical adjustments
    in the bolder version though. Other than that, it&#39;s solid. Have you begun
    with the letterspacing and kerning? Is it done soon? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking
    for a good condensed replacement for trade gothic... this looks promising. Will
    it be sold? '

  body: ' sorry, I should have been more specific. I did not intend to say that I
    did not like the font. I still feel, however, that the bold weight has some small
    &#40;but important&#41; issues to confront. specifically, I noticed the negative
    area at the base of the lc a, b, and d where the bowl encounters the stroke and
    the space around the bar on the uc Q. the adjustments I am referring to may be
    entirely void in reality because of the corrupting effects of screen resolution
    -- just offering my observations. it really is a nice piece of work overall. '

  body: ' i&#39;m not crazy about the way lc t terminates in the boldest version.
    it could use a little tapering of the stroke as it gets to the end, or maybe shorten
    the actual stroke. i dig the lc e. the diagonal crossbar is nice. '

  body: ' Nice sans. I agree with Isaac on the &#39;t&#39; and would go a step further
    to say all weights of the &#39;t&#39; seem to flare too much, it doesn&#39;t seem
    appropriate in this instance. As for optics. The fig &#39;4&#39; seems to suffer
    quite a bit from the weight interpolation, as does the &#39;M&#39; and &#39;N&#39;.
    Your notches in the characters &#39;d&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;g&#39;, &#39;p&#39;,
    &#39;q&#39; and &#39;r&#39; &#40;&#39;Q&#39;&#41; all but disappear. It might
    be nice to exaggerate a bit, maybe? The &#39;j&#39; and &#39;f&#39; characters
    seem to flare also. I really like the severity of it though. Nothing like bowing
    to the master and sticking to the grid. ;&#41; '
