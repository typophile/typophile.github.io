  body: "To make things easier, I presume this is the font you want to know, with
    its unusual R:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n_4885.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe script
    painted on the wall is not type. I was just looking through the scripts at [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/styles/script.php|Letterhead
    Fonts]] for another ID here. They have some that might do a similar job."
