body: I've just done these frames & fleurons trying to create a stylised jugendstil
  look. Not sure if I've succeeded. I'd love to hear what you think.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/frames_3831.gif]

  body: Don't know if they're "stylised jugendstil" (they reminds me of bank notes),
    but I like them! :-)

- body: They don't evoke jugendstil to me, either. Jugendstil is organic; these are
    mathematical. To be more like jugendstil, try adding some thickness and variation
    to your strokes to look more like vines or stems.

  body: I agree with Alaskan's comments. They don't feel Jugendstil to me either but
    I LOVE THEM!!! I would use them if you ever release them!

  body: "Thanks for the comments!\r\nI was a bit afraid I deviated from jugendstil
    quite a bit along the way. I actually did try the different stroke weights with
    the spirograph-like 'flowers' but thought they looked better in the same weight.\r\n@
    Jennifer > no plans of releasing these as I did them for fun, but if you want
    I can send you the Illustrator file."
