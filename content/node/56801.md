    those green cell colors if I were you. Go to the Multiple Master section of Font
    Info and set the default Weight Vector to something other than 0 or 1000. This
    will change the display in the Font Window and you will see any interpolation
    anomalies that might be hiding."

    a way, yes, the first master you design can be used to construct the other master(s).\r\n\r\nFor
    me, this is much better because everything will be compatible from the start as
    you place every point at the right place from the start (and it is very easy to
    see if it is placed wrong aswell). You can see the both masters together all the
    time, and easy compare details and test the details how they look in the interim
    weights. If you extrapolate the weights at the same time (with the slider) it
    is also very easy to see errors. Everything is so visible if you for instance
    go below the 0, and put in -200 or something.\r\n\r\nFurther, you can kern them
    both at the same time, build your sidebearing system so it is compatible, put
    in all the OT-features, classes etc.\r\n\r\nIt is also good because you will have
    the exact same character set through out the family without even thinking specially
    about it, no glyph will be forgotten.\r\n\r\nI always make the fonts as ready
    as possible in the MM-project, so when i pick out the weights, the only thing
    to do is to go through the glyphs and make small, small adjustments \u2013 and
    rebuild the kern feature :)\r\n"

  body: "Could anyone help me? I've been searching for sources that properly explain
    how to work with masters but to no avail. The only tutorial video I can find is
    a Polish one, which gives insight into the process but he shows how the master
    works on only one letter by adjusting it for the light master, while I already
    designed two weights to use as masters. I read the whole chapter on Multiple Masters
    and interpolation from the FontLab manual but I feel the information is very incomplete.
    It's probably complete if you consider more than 700 pages came before it, but
    this specific chapter on its own doesn't give all the information.\r\n\r\nI managed
    to get steps further by reading your comments. I blended two weights and almost
    half my glyphs are green now while the other almost-half is white, with some glyphs
    in red. What does it mean when glyphs remain white? Won't they be interpolated?
    If not it seems I have to do a lot of manual work either way, but I still like
    to get as much of the work done automatically anyway.\r\n\r\nAlso, I can't find
    out how to open up the panel with the slider so I can adjust the weight. Right
    now I just have a font file with two blended weights and have no idea how to proceed
    further. I'm seriously frustrated with the lack of documentation on FontLab. I
    always spend hours researching and in the end get nothing done. I always learn
    things, but it requires a tremendous amount of time to finally find the answers
    I was looking for.\r\n\r\nAnd to clarify, I'm actually trying to extrapolate,
    though I've never worked with Multiple Masters before so I'm looking forward to
    do interpolation as well. I designed Light, Regular and Bold and right now I require
    Black and figured I may be able to do at least some of the work automatically
    using extrapolation."
