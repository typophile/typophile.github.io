  body: I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find a font to match that exactly. But I would
    <BR>start with Orator and the OCRs.

  body: Since it&#39;s printed by another method &#40;mechanical&#41;, as Stephen
    said, you won&#39;t find a font to match it, but FontFont has a number of simulations
    of other printing methods such as FF Call, FF Gateway, FF Eboy and FF Luggagetag
    -- none are very close to your samples but might be starting points.
