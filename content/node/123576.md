    in the metal type/phototypesetting/digital type worlds. It most likely had a basis
    in large wood type of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nI found many similar fonts, but
    no spot-on matches. For the numbers, Octin Sports is very similar:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/octin-sports/\r\n\r\n"

    supply houses such as Michigan Church Supply http://www.michiganchurchsupply.com/-c-100_842.html?sort=3d&page=1
    I obtained the remaining numbers from that source and combined all numbers into
    a single number-set. I removed the white on black optical illusion which alters
    perception of weight and produced the following reference: \r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/HymnsetBonW_5092.jpg]\r\nI
    trust it will be helpful in selecting a substitute font where most letters would
    be a rough match for the casual reader.\r\nOctin College Semibold http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/octin-college/
    \ could perhaps be the closest. Too wide, but it has a similar weight and has
    angles inside the counters. Octin College is the same as Octin Sports [already
    suggested] but lacks the non-conforming serifs, except on _1_. \r\nRunner up:
    Directory Board JNL. It also has a similar weight and, but has rounded rather
    than angular corners inside the counters.\r\nDon"
