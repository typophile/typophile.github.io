  use with my engraving machine. I was thinking I would start with an existing handwriting
  font that has a fairly even thickness and modify it from there. \r\n\r\nThe engraving
  machine software allows you to choose between it's own fonts which they call Vistool
  Fonts and have the extension .af4 or a True Type Font. I have a request into the
  company to see if there is some way for me to create a true single line font and
  somehow get it to into their format but I highly doubt I will get anywhere with
  that. So, I am thinking I will go with a true type font which I realize will not
  really be a single line but really 2 lines on top of each other. I think this will
  work okay though a true single line would be better. \r\n\r\nI would love to find
  someone to help me achieve a finished font that I can use. Please get in touch if
  you are interested in working together on this project. I would like to move quickly
  but need to have some idea of the cost of doing this. If the 1st font works well
  than I would like to do more. \r\n\r\nThanks so much! \r\n\r\n-Julie \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hey Julie,\r\n\r\nActually I did such a typeface in the fall of 2009. It's
    a monoline family which was used for a pitch of a Bi\xEBnnial. The project never
    got finished, so the fonts are ready (basic character set) and waiting to be used.\r\n\r\nMy
    original idea was to have a monoline which I then could give different strokes
    in Illustrator. These fonts are TTF's including A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and punctuation.\r\n\r\nGroeten,\r\nDries\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MAD_1_4005.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MAD_2_5467.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MAD_3_3786.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MAD_4_6007.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MAD_5_4920.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MAD_6_4354.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MAD_7_6263.png]"
