  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey all,

I've recently run into a slight dilemma.  I did a document and formatted the times in this method: hh:mm xx,(4:50 pm)

My client wants the times to all be in this format: hh:mm X.X. (4:50 P.M.)

Personally, I cringe at the thought of visually disturbing the flow of the text like that, but it made me wonder.

What is the proper way, I know all forms xx, x.x., XX, and X.X. are accepted, but what is the most widely accepted, what do you as designers do, and are there prominent examples of use?

Thanks in advance for your insight on this matter, I never considered that I didn't know this before.</div>

You will meet resistance to both lc and no periods. I have a customer who runs for The Chicago Manual of Style every time I make a style decision like this. CMoS goes with a.m. and p.m. So, she comes running to me waving the examples in 9.42. She never looked carefully enough to see the "often appear in small capitals..., in which case periods are unnecessary."

You will be much happier if your face includes true sc rather than a set-small large cap.

		<div class="commentbody">In Ireland the 24-hour clock tends to be preferred... but it's considered bad form to omit the full stops from "a.m." Why? Because while "a.m." and "p.m." are used in English, both are also used in Irish, and "am" is a noun meaning 'time' in Irish. So for consistency (particularly in light of bilingual invitations and so on) "a.m." is recommended here.

In Irish "roimh nóin" and "iarnóin" are also used for "before noon" and "afternoon"; the abbreviations are "r.n." and "in." though "i.n." is also seen.

I love that book. i do agree though, small caps keep the flow, where as periods sometime stops it (I'm personally not a fan of the periods in the AM and PM).

Maybe on the grounds of disambiguation: the periods prevent "A.M." from becoming "AM," which is a word. I know, I know: in books for readers with any degree of smart much beyond a brick, this will not be an issue; they'll dig that it is time we are talking about here, not a state of existence. 

Maybe for some the periods "stop the flow." Not for me.

Dez's dubble-period example is indeed horrid. But he needn't worry. In this case the period serves equally as part of the abbreviation and as the sentence terminal. You could look that up in Chicago at 9.42 ("The first train leaves at 5:22 a.m. and the last at 11:00 p.m.").

Which leads me to say, once again: Following Chicago or Bringhurst should always take second place to our own well-considered ideas of what helps a page. As long as they are indeed "well-considered."

Horrid also is the lack of a space following the hour number.

		<div class="commentbody">wow! tremendous insight everybody, thanks a ton!  I'd love to keep hearing different persepctives on it.

Some more specific information about the actual situation I'm dealing with right now.  I am making a flyer equivalent to a conference schedule for a series of training sessions happening at a college here in my town.  Space is at a premium and the chart has to fit within the width of a standard letter-sized sheet.

I haven't be fortunate to have the shortest workshop names, and the names on the chart are literally usually half of the actual full name of each session already!

I put the format as <em>'5:00 pm'</em> and my supervisor requested <em>'5:00 P.M.'</em> "because that's the proper way to do it, and also to change the times throughout the body copy to that format as well to be consistent."

I can understand including the 'pm' so people don't show up at 5 am to the college, but I think making the times that big and spaced out will ultimately break the flow of the chart, and if I do it my way in the chart, I must remain constant throughout the whole document.

I am using Myriad Pro SemiCondensed, which unfortunately, doesn't have Small Caps that I could find anywhere.  Here's a picture of what I've got so far:

		<div class="commentbody">Is it set in stone that you should be using Myriad? There are tons of sans serif fonts that look rather similar, and give you the same weight on the page. A little play on words early. I have found a new love...Stone Sans. It might not be what you're looking for, but just throwing that out there. I think the SC are the best option, it will satisfy both parties, and look good :)

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah I'm locked into using Myriad, she tried forcing me to use Trebuchet like all of her previous print work and I fought for one we could both stand.  Since she often wants to fit too much text into too little space, I found Myriad was one we both like, and the semi-condensed allowed us to save as much space as we could per line, without being too small and condensed to read.

I have checked out Stone Sans, and I do like it, but I don't think I have the liberty of using it here unfortunately.

I'm also worried, she wants me to create a power-point template using MSoffice fonts and I'm pretty sure she's going to revert back to using Trebuchet for all of her on-screen work.  I like the feel of Lucida Sans but I don't know what to tell her to use for on-screen and web use.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I haven't used this feature, but PowerPoint (Windows) has the ability to embed, or include, font files in its documents. There's also the option to package the presentation into a self-sufficient file with everything (fonts included) already in the package. You would have to verify the legality of this for the particular licenses of the font files you're using, but it may be worth looking into.

		<div class="commentbody">oooh wow, thanks for that <strong>agarzola</strong>!  I had no idea that existed.  I thought that sort of thing only started in the past couple of years and I never expected to look for it in office.

I checked out the article, and the limitation is that it's only able to do this with TrueType fonts, but worth trying!

Now lets check those fonts and licences.....I wonder what Truetypes I have that allow this sort of use.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Glad to be of service, innovati. I only stumbled unto that article last week, while researching PowerPoint behavior regarding font substitution for a small rush project. In the end I didn't need to embed anything, as Georgia saved the day and, thus, I could get away with not worrying about font substitution. (A good thing, too… I use the Mac OS version of PowerPoint, which sadly —yet predictably— doesn't have embedding capabilities.)

Good luck with your project!</div>
