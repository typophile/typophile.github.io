body: "I am looking for a sans serif typeface that suggests science, technology, and
  mathematics without seeming clich\xE9d or trite. I am looking for something with
  enough character to be distinctive, but still appropriate for an academic publication.\r\n\r\nThis
  is for a redesign of a magazine for a college of physical and mathematical sciences.
  The institution and the magazine are fairly traditional and academic. Articles mostly
  deal with research conducted by students and faculty. The audience is primarily
  students and alumni in the college.\r\n\r\nThe typeface will be used for things
  like cover lines, pull quotes, headlines, subheads, etc. It will range in size from
  about 10 to 18 points, and will be paired with something like minion or caslon for
  body copy. It would be nice to have a decent range of weights.\r\n\r\nMy first choice
  now is DIN, but it seems a bit overused and obvious. Any suggestions will be very
  appreciated. Thanks."

    worked quite well.

  body: "Sans: \r\nEdgy but not too: Interstate, Meta.\r\nEmigre Cholla interesting
    but lacks enough weights for you.\r\nStylish but not calling attention to itself:
    Linotype Syntax (available with OSFs)\r\nStraight vanilla workhorse well matched
    to serifs like Caslon: ITC Franklin Gothic\r\n\r\nFor the serif, also take a look
    at Adobe OpenType Warnock, very very crisp, stylish, and good for science.\r\n\r\nMy
    approach would be: Warnock and Linotype Syntax, a champ combo! "

  body: Thanks for your suggestions. I am really liking Klavika, Stratum, and Pill
    Gothic, they each have nice little quirky details. Syntax is also nice, I may
    come back to that if I need a more conservative face. I considered Cholla, but
    it is a little too quirky for this project.
