    I think it\u2019s OK to link to a free font site. We do that all the time."

  body: 'Jan the font itself is probably freeware, the site however had links to other
    fonts which should not be listed. If someone needs it they can google for the
    font name Lisa suggested. I''m just trying to keep things above board. There are
    very few free font site links we''ll leave up. '

  body: OK Tiffany. That sounds plausible. Which sites are OK to link to?

  body: "Lisa, no need to apologize. Sometimes moderating is hit and miss and in this
    case I know you weren't trying to do anything wrong.\r\n\r\nJan, that's the problem,
    really. We really  need the people wanting to post the links to sites to be more
    aware of what else is available on those \"free font\" sites. DaFont for one.
    I've been told they are good about removing fonts which shouldn't be listed. I
    suppose we need to add this to the Free Font wiki entry."
