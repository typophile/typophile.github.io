    and <a href=\"http://www.blambot.com/\">Blambot</a>, but I can't find an exact
    match.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, the font I've found that has the most in common with
    your mystery font (in the basic letterforms) is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/gfy-handwriting-fontpak/gfyjeanna-regular/\">GFYJeanna</a>,
    a <a href=\"http://www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5456\">\"Go Font Yourself\"</a>
    font from <a href=\"http://www.chank.com/\">Chank</a>. I suppose there's a chance
    that your mystery font is a customized -- and much-improved -- version of GFYJeanna.\r\n\r\nIf
    you don't need an exact match (and no one else is able to find one for you), I
    suggest that you go through the offerings of Comicraft and Blambot. They both
    have many fonts that are much nicer than an unmodified GFYJeanna."

  body: "I've been hunting for this in <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html\">Part
    11 of the Script Font ID Guide</a>, which is all hand-printed fonts. I used the
    'G' and the 'y' as my initial filter, and I couldn't find a match for this lettering.
    \ \r\n\r\nThe problem, as our <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forums/typeid/faq\">FAQ</a>
    says, is that there are just too many hand-printed fonts, because they are cheap
    and easy to make. It's very possible that this is a custom font done for this
    company.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is similar to Spire's, although I suggest looking
    for a similar font in the Script Guide, and then looking up the supplier in the
    Reference List. Many of them can be found as free downloads, or part of a rather
    inexpensive font collection.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "I just went and had a look at GFY Jeanna and I absolutely believe that the
    same person who did that lettering did your sample. The 'g' and 'G' are obvious
    differences, but it looks like the one used for the ad is a 'cleaned up' version
    of that lettering.\r\n\r\nThe problem is still that this was probably done as
    a custom version, so you will have to find the best match available.\r\n\r\n-

    tweaked the spacing and stroked the type to get it closer to the weight of the
    original. Aside from that, this is an unmodified GFYJeanna.)\r\n\r\nI'm pretty
    convinced now that this font started life as GFYJeanna."

  body: There's a very good chance that this customization job was done by Chank himself.
    It's probably worth a shot to <a href="http://www.chank.com/contact.php">contact
    him directly</a> to see if he can provide you with the exact font.

  body: "My impression, partly based on things I have read before, was that Chank
    doesn't actually do all of those handwriting fonts. Handwriting is, after all,
    handwriting, and usually reflects an individual style. Looking through those GFY
    fonts suggests to me that they were not all done by the same individuals, although
    I guess anything is possible.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that 'Spire' might not
    be right. My point was mainly that I think the information that Chank designed
    those fonts may be oversimplifying their true origins.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    <a href=\"http://www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5456\">Go Font Yourself Handwriting
    Fontpak</a>, which includes GFYJeanna, is a collection of Chank's favorite GFY

    first place).\r\n\r\nBTW, Mike, you can call me Edward if you like. :)"

  body: "Thanks, gents, I think you've got it. I appreciate the homework and the fast
    reply, as always.\r\n\r\nAnd Mike: your ID Guides are phenomenal...thanks for
    providing such a great resource for the type community. I've already used them
    countless times. If I could humbly offer one suggestion to you about the site,
    inspired by Edward Tufte, it would be to integrate the Supplier Reference List
    into the ID Guide itself, so clicking on a given sample takes your visitor (via
    target=\"_blank\" or something) to the respective supplier's site. I know it's
    more work for you to integrate the two, but I think it would ultimately make searching
    a simpler, one-step affair. Also, you could keep the Supplier Reference List,
    which has obvious merits unto itself, as a feature on the site.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again all.\r\n\r\n--Michael.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n//

  body: "Michael, \r\n\r\nThanks for your comments about my Guides. I agree that your
    suggestion would make things easier for the users, but there are two main reasons
    that I have not made links to suppliers from the samples:\r\n1) There are multiple
    suppliers for most of the fonts, since the designing foundry is usually only one
    source, and I am not trying to play favorites, even though I could benefit from
    doing so, with sales referral fees. \r\n2) Links have a way of getting out of
    date, and the maintenance task would be horrendous. I have been lucky enough to
    have wonderfully generous volunteers to help make samples for the Guides, and
    even to take on the design of the Serif Font ID Guide for me, but I'm spread too
    thin to take on the addition and maintenance of about 6,000 links.\r\n\r\nI am
    thinking about the idea of putting links into the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/SupplierCodes.html\">Supplier
    Codes List</a>, and I already do have them on the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/providers.html\">Type
    Providers page</a>.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
