  on this logotype? I can't seem to identify this one, though it seems familiar. \r\n\r\nIs
  this a commercial font? or a free font?\r\n\r\nThanks for the help.\r\n\r\nBest
  regards."

    your sample (see FAQ about how to post images), and if you edit your title to

  body: "Hi Mike,\r\n\r\nThanks for the really quick reply :). \r\n\r\nMy solution
    currently is to just do a trace in Illustrator since I don't have this font installed.
    And I don't need to buy it since I'm gonna use it for one quick work only :).\r\n\r\nReally
    appreciate the help.\r\n\r\nThanks and best regards.\r\n\r\n- Romar\r\n\r\n"
