  Reiner]] designed this typeface for the [[Klingspor]] foundry in Germany.\r\n\r\n[[Peter
  Bain]] and [[Paul Shaw]] have this to say about Gotika:\r\n<em>It is both highly
  stylized and simplified. It could be characterized as an Art Deco interpretation
  of a [[textura]].</em>\r\n\r\n[[Paul Renner]] recommended using Gotika as a headline
  face for text set in French Didones. Wow.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no commercial
  digital revival of this typeface."
