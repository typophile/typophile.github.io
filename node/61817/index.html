  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi there.
This is new for me. Just joined Typophile, but interested in being involved in the conversation here and showing and sharing ideas. Really lovin the community from what I see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on a couple logo projects right now. Here is one of them:
&ldquo;For the Sake of the Name&rdquo; conference logo</p>
<p>It is for an all staff conference/retreat for a Christian ministry organization. Want it to be fun, not too &ldquo;serious,&rdquo; but to show a sort of professionalism.</p>
<p>Here is what I&rsquo;ve done so far. I would be super grateful for your thoughts:</p>

<p>On the font: I like it, but depending on your audience, it might be to organic. Also, the &ldquo;for the sake of&rdquo; part seems a bit out of place: Because it&rsquo;s rather similar to the other typeface, it looks more like a mistake than a deliberate choice.</p>

<p>Good thoughts. The shape, yes, should reflect a lake and rolling hills a bit, but not too much. The conference is supposed to be more of a retreat than sessions &amp; learning etc, so they want a more relaxed, but professional look to the branding and materials.</p>
<p>About the fonts, I&rsquo;ll keep working at it. And post some new ideas.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t like the fonts on (B) - would that be better if the fonts were re-worked?
Thanks again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d consider making the grey horisont line white, and playing around with transparent shades of blue (water) and green (hills). 
Perhaps a venetian serif like <a href="http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/eason">Eason</a> could give you an organic, lively touch without being to cheesy?</p>
<p>Rembember to consider how this will work in one colour.</p>

Thanks again. I implemented a bit of your suggestions. Tried the white horizon line, but thought maybe the new treatment might work? the line hides behind the background before getting to the end.</p>
<p>Here is my newest version of A. Thanks again to anyone who can offer some thoughts and pointers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was hoping someone else would comment on this as well. I&rsquo;m more of a student, so I would take my words with a grain of salt. Anyhow, here&rsquo;s my two cents:</p>
<p>The type look more suiting to the audience, just remember to give your caps some breathing space. Normal capitals are not spaced to work together in an all cap setting and need to be tracked out a bit. Thus, professional fonts have Small Caps especially made for these situations, and also slightly lower (and wider) making them stand out less in text.</p>
<p>Two things are sticking out. The numerals (are they scaled up old style figures? – they are much heavier) and the first line (set in lower case only). Both are bugging me because they&rsquo;re not being echoed anywhere else, and I&rsquo;m generally bugged by a sentence not starting with a capital when there&rsquo;s no apparent reason for it not to;)</p>
<p>I would love to see the island on it&rsquo;s own, with no type on top of it! Perhaps a few different versions with smaller type (It think it might be a bit large).</p>

Though a student, you are providing some good pointers to someone is not a type guru (though am really wanting to learn more). Students sometimes have a fresh perspective that others might not. Have to show clients some ideas today, so am working hard on that. Once we nail down a direction to go in, I&rsquo;ll post more here.</p>
<p>If anyone else has thoughts to add, I will be continuing to work on this project.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ll echo everything Frode pointed out above. I&rsquo;ll also give a further reason for changing the black line in the mark to white (or another color if you find a better alternative). Right now, the line in black makes it look like another element of the text, not something related to the mark. A logo that already has so many textual elements, such as this, doesn&rsquo;t need more confusion from the mark.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see the mark perhaps a bit smaller and on its own, away from the text. Experiment with other kinds of fonts as well. I&rsquo;m not sure this serif is going to cut it.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;d agree with the other comments.the bold numbers seems out of place.</p>
<p>have you tried &lsquo;for the sake of&rsquo; in either small caps or all caps (spaced wider)?</p>
<p>also, i&rsquo;d experiment making &lsquo;cadence 2010 conference&rsquo; smaller, so that it&rsquo;s about the same width as &lsquo;the name&rsquo; or the line.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d also agree with trying a version with the mark and text separate.</p>
<p>all the best, this is taking shape nicely!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi, I haven&rsquo;t exactly worked on this a lot the past few days, but I&rsquo;ve sketched out a couple other ideas. Any thoughts on if I should totally leave these 2 new ones (C &amp; D) and keep with the original. Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>@Simon -
Thanks for the welcome! Good thoughts on lining up the bottom text. I&rsquo;ve worked a little on that but I will continue to keep it in mind for the next revision.</p>
<p>@penn - thanks too for your thoughts on the line. I have implemented a white line. Making it thinner works. I did try taking it out altogether but then it kind of lost something - didn&rsquo;t make sense as to why the words were arranged how they are. But I&rsquo;m still working with it.</p>
<p>Again, thanks to all -</p>
