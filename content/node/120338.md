  in the attacked logo. I am mostly certain the \"Lionel\" and \"Authorized Value
  Added Dealer\" sections are Myriad Pro, but I am not sure since the shape looks
  slightly different between Myriad Pro and what is in the logo (slightly more pointed
  on the corners compared to the logo's contents). I am also unable to identify what
  font \"Since 1900\" is in.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated, thank you."
