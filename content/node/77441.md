  I know professional foundries can master fonts (hinting etc) for you but it costs
  a bomb.\r\n\r\nAnybody know how one goes about geting in touch with the finer points

  body: "I agree with frank. I've met several designers with great ideas for typefaces,
    but never coming to the point of realizing for lack of time and practice. A cooperation
    with either a type designer or a foundry would help to bring these fresh ideas
    into production.\r\n\r\nI also remember that igizio marini offers [[http://ikern.com/k1/|iKern]],
    a service for spacing and kerning, which would normally take up a bulk of time
    and a lot of experience to complete. I know that Jos Buivenga (of Calluna and
    Museo fame) has also used this service for some of his fonts and it seems to work
    quite well. You already need to have all your character set completed in fontlab
    though, so perhaps you could start on that.\r\n\r\nAnd if you plan to import your
    illustrator drawings in fontlab, make sure not to have to scale them in fontlab,
    as this will cause a lot of distortion. the x-height of your letter needs to be
    1000 points high if I remember correctly, to import at 100 percent in fontlab."

    recommend ScanFont, from the FontLab folks. It's only $99 or so and it makes importing
    Illustrator outlines into FontLab a breeze. If you set up your Illustrator outlines
    in any kind of alphabetical order, you can bring them all into the correct code
    points in FontLab in a blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nI never leave home without it."

    ScanFont has a scaling tool that does that for you. In fact, if your Illustrator
    document is too large (dimensionally) you may run into some problems with ScanFont.

  body: "Getting the meaning of words correct is important. Thus, I will not criticize
    Kent Lew for pointing out that creating the outlines of glyphs does not, itself,
    constitute the creation of a font, even if it is the design of a typeface.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    while it isn't the creation of a font, if it is the design of a typeface, then
    it is also the design of the important part of fonts which implement that typeface.
    One can indeed say that designing a font may also involve setting up the hinting
    and the kerning, but it is possible to skip those steps and just push a button
    and have a font of sorts created from a set of character outlines. So the term
    \"design a font\" is perhaps too ambiguous to properly criticize in this fashion."

    at Typophile, then one should be apprised of elementary mistakes in terminology.\r\nA
    collection of glyphs is not a typeface, especially if it has never been made into
    a font and never been used for setting type.\r\nIt could at best be described
    as \"a design for a typeface\", in the way that an architect's plans may be termed
