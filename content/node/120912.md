  printer Christophe Plantin working in Antwerp during the Renaissance, another important
  figure dominated the market but as a type designer: Hendrik van den Keere.\r\n\r\n\xB6
  The question that comes to mind now is what's the real Hendrik van den Keere \"roman\"
  available on digital format:\r\n\r\n<em>Renard</em> (Fred Smeijers)\r\n<em>DTL VandenKeere</em>
  (Frank E. Blokland)\r\n<em>Poynter Old Style</em> (Tobias Frere-Jones)\r\nOther\u2026\r\n\r\n\xB6
  Many thanks to your inputs to come."

  body: "DTL VandenKeere or DTL Van  Den Keere, as I saw it on Luc Devoye's site,
    appears to be the one of those three that is intended as an authentic version
    of the original, little changed except for being \"trued up\" to modern standards.
    (\"When will one ever learn\", asked Goudy, but I honestly think that the need
    to \"true up\" faces for them to be considered acceptably well-crafted is not
    going to go away anytime soon.)\r\n\r\nOne has to open up that \"e\" if one is
    intending to create a typeface like Poynter Oldstyle, which became the most widely
    used newspaper typeface - displacing the faces that displaced Corona and its cousins.\r\n\r\nI
    saw from one of my results that van den Keere himself shortened the ascenders
    and descenders on at least one existing face - a Middelbaar Canon - for it to
    be usable in the context of his time, so one can't complain too much that he in
    his turn received the same treatment.\r\n\r\nAs for Renard, it took the middle
    road - not authenticity without worrying about popularity like DTL Van Den Keere,
    not radically changing the face for a usage with special requirements such as
    newspaper use like Poynter Oldstyle, but instead making a typeface suitable for
    present day book publication.\r\n\r\nGiven such obvious and clear differences
    between the three typefaces you've mentioned, choosing one of them as the \"real\"
    (or simply the best) revival of the Romans of Hendrik van den Keere, depending
    on one's criteria, isn't at all difficult, but one would have to bring other choices
    in to make it illuminating."
