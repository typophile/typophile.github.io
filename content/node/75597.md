  at the back of a book? (ie, This book is typeset in xxxxxxx).\r\n\r\nI'm wondering
  if it's common to list the digital foundry of the version used (if there are multiple
  similar versions out there) and also, if the original foundry should be included
  (ie, should Akzidenz Grotesk be credited as \"Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk\"...)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    down to the botom of the page and check out the sample."

  body: "A lot of times, the fonts will be listed on the CIP page, along with the
    book designer, the typesetter, and the printer (or just the line \"Manufactured
    in the United States of America,\" for example). When fonts are listed here, usually
    nothing much is said about type -- occasionally, it will include the foundry,
    e.g.,\r\n\r\nSet in Carter & Cone Galliard\r\n\r\nWhen more detailed information
    is given, as Nick says, it would be in a colophon at the back of the book. Sadly,
    that's a disposable page if required to make even forms. The CIP page is always
    printed."

  body: "I think that the foundry name should be included when it's a key part of
    identifying the typeface. For example, one should never write in such a place
    simply \"Garamond\" or \"Caslon\" but include the foundry to identify which version
    one used, because they are often quite different.\r\n\r\nWhen it's not critical
    in distinguishing the typeface, I think it's still a pleasant courtesy, as is
    identifying the typeface designer.\r\n\r\nAlso, any book that identifies the book
    designer should also identify the type designer(s), however, just as a matter
    of fairness. Also the jacket designer and/or artist....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
