body: "Thanks to all for your expertise. I'm a graphic designer; my focus was always
  more on illustration, but I've learned a LOT that I needed to learn about typography
  by lurking here. \r\n\r\nHere's a question:\r\nA while back I bought Body Copy Sans
  Pro by Bergsland. \r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/body-copy-sans-pro]]\r\nIt
  filled a gap in my text font collection; I had no \"elegant\" formal sans for such
  things as an invitation to a classy event; all were more utilitarian. \r\n\r\nI
  use the font way less than I expected, because I'm uncertain what display or headline
  font to use with it. I'm concerned I'll choose something that clashes; contemporary
  display fonts don't look right at all.\r\n\r\nWhat harmonizing headline font would
  you use with this body font if you wanted a distinctive, elegant look? What about
  Sigvar Bold?\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/sigvar-serial]]\r\n\r\nOr
  something like Bernhard Bold, even with the swash capitals?\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bernhard-modern]]\r\n\r\nI
  was also considering one somewhat decorative with an Art Nouveau flavor, Letterhead
  Fancy Caps or Beaumarchais...Am I completely off base?\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/coffee-bin-fonts/letterhead]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/beaumarchais]]\r\n\r\nWhat
  about an upright script like Adore or Serena or even Pendulum?\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/adore]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/serena/]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/pendulum/]]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your help! ~ Dina\r\n"
