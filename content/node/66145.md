  heard these two.\r\n\r\nGood type is like good lighting in a museum. It showcases
  the contents without being distracting or too noticeable.\r\n\r\nTypography is like
  the voice talent in an ad. You don't notice it when it's professional and appropriate,
  but when it's not, it just feels cheesy."

  body: "I tell my students that typefaces are like songs. They express or elicit
    different feelings. They can be trendy or timeless, you can get tired of certain
    ones, and that there will always be a need for new ones. \r\n\r\nI just realized
    another similarity - you can purchase them legitimately, or \"share\"/(steal)
    them on-line. \r\n\r\n"

    to our crafts as being art, when really they <em>are</em> forms of art. Functional,
    yes, crafted, yes, organized, but still art.

    Typesetting is composing and you can create crescendos, diminuendos, rests, etc\u2026\r\n\r\nMainly
    what I typeset are terse headlines and taglines. I set them the way I want to
    hear them.\r\n\r\nI was recently talking to another Creative Director who used
    to be a voice over artist and when he sets text he invents voices that correspond
    to the font. He also hears the type when he sets it.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: 'I like type as the ''voice'' of words on the page. The clothing analogy is
    good as well. And the analogy to shoes, which I think Hrant has often used, seems
    to work particularly well for text type. They have analogous practical constraints:
    comfort in walking, comfort in reading--yet style and beauty are also very important.
    Also you have different shoes for different purposes, and suiting the shoe to
    the outfit, etc. It is a surprisingly robust analogy. '

    the same time that not only have to have the same characteristics but also at
    the end have to stay together well, forming a whole new painting.\r\nIt is in
    my eyes one of the most difficult tasks in the midst of the battle between technique
    and art that mankind ever faced.\r\nVery modest way to see it, I admit ;-))\r\n\r\nsalute\r\nStefan"
