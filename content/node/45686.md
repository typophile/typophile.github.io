  body: "Dear Ricardo,\r\n\r\nI presented the first article to my History of Graphic
    Design course last fall but find it does not answer the question of who owns this
    symbol.\r\n\r\nFrom conversation with Harry Allen, the fact that the American
    Red Cross licenses the symbol to corporations who make commercial profit from
    it is not answered by the organization's lawyers stance that they are doing no
    wrong.  Is it right for relief agencies to compete with for-profit industry?\r\n\r\nI
    find this all a very sticky wicket, however, because of the good the American
    Red Cross does.  Living in Katrina-land, and, counting down to a new hurricane
    season, I am reminded that the Red Cross is the ONLY American agency who, time
    and again, is called upon and does respond for disaster relief. \r\n\r\nSo, my
    question is, who is the grabby one?  J&J for registering a universal symbol for
    commercial profit in the first place or the American Red Cross for overstepping
    past bounds?\r\n\r\nIt is my personal experience that in business, as with life,
    best practices need always to be evaluated periodically. Which is why I find this
    issue so interesting."

  body: "Hi, Nancy,\r\n\r\nYou bring up a lot of good questions. I've made modest
    donations to the Red Cross myself, because I too believe that they actually do
    something in times of natural and man-made disasters.\r\n\r\nBut even non-profits
    have to find ways to raise money so that they can continue to exist and do good,
    and that's where the sticky issues come up, I think. (I have mixed feelings about
    non-profits using for-profit methods, but that's just me.)\r\n\r\nSlightly related:
    I remember that a few years ago, the band Red Kross had to change the way they
    spell their name due to a conflict with the Red Cross... I think the band The
    Postal Service had similar issues with the United States Postal Service.\r\n\r\nBut
    back to your original post. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/09/business/09cross.html?em\">This
    New York Times article</a> gives dates for when the American Red Cross and Johnson
    and Johnson each started using the symbol.\r\n\r\nYou can read a history of the
    use of the red cross and red crescent symbols <a href=\"http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/emblem-history\">here</a>."

  body: "Hi Ricardo,\r\n\r\nThank you for the two additional links.  I like the history
    of the cross and crescents.\r\n\r\nI believe that the Red Cross has had a lot
    of management difficulties recently, something like two or three presidents having
    to resign within a year.  I know that that is not an assignment I would be interested
    in fulfilling, balancing budgets trying to do the right thing in the face of enormous
    challenge.\r\n\r\nBesides, I wouldn't consider a major corporation any expert
    in moral leadership.  So, I think what they did to try to make money in the same
    manner as companies who now appear to be competition, is okay.\r\n\r\nBut, that's
    my opinion."

    most of my stationery business is based on hand writing personal correspondence
    delivered by the post office, it is tough to see how silly they are some time.
    \ I am not at all sure that it was a good business decision to shrink wrap and
    hand process a piece of junk mail that got mangled in their system.  Well, at
    least the rates went up.\r\n"

  body: "Sorry,\r\n\r\nI established an account while I was teaching \"Design to Music
    Industry Majors\", a senior level university course, it was fascinating.  I learned
    more I taught, well sort of.\r\n\r\nAnyway, please establish an account, you can
    use an alias.  MySpace is the industry network for the entertainment industry,
    and, if you have been keeping up with the magazine, JUXTAPOS, art/design/(type)
    converge these days.  Which is why I am using Typophile, Wordpress, UTube, the
    Loyola University New Orleans Blackboard platforms to structure and teach an experimental,
    online studio design course this summer.\r\n\r\nMySpace is pretty obnoxious but
    it is the industry standard for the music industry.  So, although it was a real
    reach for me to make an account, I have.  And now use it to teach from.  (In the
    online course each student is required to post an item to their 'sketchbook' once
    a day, five days a week by five p.m. for the duration\u2013eight weeks.)\r\n\r\nI
    hope that you will logon."
