  I thought it might be Burgues, Compendium or Zaner Four, but the characters (especially
  for the fancy caps) don't seem to match up. This is the first script I've seen with
  a roman numeral glyph - although that could be faked with three slashes and some
  extra swashes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/carter_fred_5_6699.jpg]"

  body: I considered hand lettering, but I thought it might be a font since the capital
    F's (and other repeated glyphs) seemed perfectly identical. Thanks for clearing
    that up, Jan!

  body: "it\u2019s Ale Paul\u2019s Burgues Script, but with heavily modded uppercase
    letters. some of them may even be taken from other typefaces. the roman numerals
    are also custom. \r\nbut if you take a look at the [[http://www.veer.com/download/pdf/burguesscript.pdf|PDF]]
    you will recognize the lowercase characters, especially the alternate ones like
    the \u201Dt\u201C and the ending \u201Dr\u201C used in \u201DCarter\u201C."
