body: I know the correct font for the an iPod 5G is Podium Sans from searching this
  website, but my question is whether the font is the same for the outside too [http://www.apple.com/ipod/gallery/images/ipod02_20060912.jpg
  is a link to a picture of the outside front - the only text using the font is the
  word menu on the scroll wheel]. If they are indead the same like I sorta thought
  they would, is Lucidia Sans an ok alternative for Podium Sans? Thanks for the help
  in advance.

    is based on Myriad Apple actually.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's Podium Sans because
    there is no splayed \"M\""

    body: I believe apple at one point used Myriad Apple but then switched to Podium
      Sans after the iPod photo which you can cite at wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podium_Sans).
      But my real question is if the word "MENU" on the outside of the ipod in the
      photo is the same as the font used inside the iPod, what would be the best clone
      font that is free.

  body: The outside is not Podium Sans b/c in the word "MENU" the "M" has splayed
    ends, and the Podium Sans "M" ends are verticle. Besides, Podium Sans is not used
    in any sales collateral, packaging, online, or anything else besides onscreen
    use for newer iPod. In all other applications, Apple still uses Myriad Apple.

  body: "Ok, now that I compare it, I see your completely right :)\r\nSorry for this
    rather useless question that was asked before. I was really confused by the two
    different fonts and where they were placed.\r\nThanks for the help."

    think Apple may have contributed to the confusion by orignally claiming that the
    color iPods were using Myriad as a UI font. But that's explained at the wiki. "
