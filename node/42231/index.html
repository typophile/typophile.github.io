  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all, wanted to post a mark in progress I'm working on to get some feedback, this a personal identity for a portfolio/blog site. I've been through lots of sketches and I'm at this point trying a purely typographic mark, though I'm not necessarily sold on that approach. The kerning on "digital" needs some work but I'm more looking to see if the overall idea is working at this point. Any feedback or ideas for other typeface combinations or other directions to try greatly appreciated, thanks.

On your site - is "in theatres" in Gotham?   Either way, if "digital" were to look more like that, and be de-emphasized colorwise, I think it would look pretty sweet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good thoughts guys. and eeblet, aluminum nailed it...i did tons of sketching, research, etc., and a fig is a horribly unidentifiable shape :) I have played with the fig leaf concept and haven't yet hit on one I like, while I think the concept has some potential I want to stay away from the scripty leafy trend but i'm not at all opposed to the concept. logosam, i tried a pixel approach like that as well but kind of leaned away from it as i thought it might give an appearance of being too digital/web-centric.

That being said, here's two revisions on a combination of earlier discussed comments. I'm leaning towards the linear version, or do you guys think I should explore some other concepts?

To nitpick...I'm still not convinced the fi ligature works. The g seems disconnected. I'd maybe try one with a slight gap between the bar of the f and the i. </div>

I was being kind of jokey about the fig - as in, "well, I'd rather illustrate 'fig' than 'digital' if I had to illustrate something" - but now I'm wondering if an abstracted fig behind the vertical arrangement of "fig digital" wouldn't soften things up?  Something like this, only not looking like it was drawn in MS paint (I think figs have a quite distinctive shape...):

Ok, I really liked the ligature originally but after trying it the consensus was correct, it does have a much better feel with the "fi" separated. The kerning still needs to be tweaked a bit but it's darn close...any last thoughts? And thanks so much for all the help and advice, greatly appreciated.
