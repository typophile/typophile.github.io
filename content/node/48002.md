  body: Yes it does look like it, but I think its actually a different font, since
    I have seen it used on many occasions.

  body: "Sorry to burst your bubble Sam but this is not Rotis SemiSerif STD. As Yves
    has already pointed out it \"looks somewhat like Rotis SemiSerif\" but it's certainly
    not a match. My guess is that this is actually derived from Rotis Serif to begin
    with. Note the balled ends of the 'a', 'r' and 'c', it would be much more difficult
    to add these to Rotis SemiSerif than to simply remove the serifs at the bottoms
    of the serifed characters. Beyond that the charactes have been squashed vertically
    with the curves of the 'a' and 'c' having been completely redrawn. I also suspect
    a stroke has been added to the arms of the capital 'T'. You can see what I'm yapping
    about visually below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tarmac_4602.jpg]"

    a custom work.

  body: "No problem. ;^)\r\n\r\nThe suffix STD only means it's a Standard OpenType
    face, a typeface with a limited character set that doesn't take advantage of advanced
    OpenType features. That's purely technological and has nothing to do with the
    design. The suffix Pro stands for 'fat' OpenType faces with extended character
    sets, like small caps, contextual ligatures, Eastern European accents, Cyrillic,
    Greek and so on. Read more about it <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/support/opentype.php/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nPretty
    sure it's a custom designed logo inspired by Rotis SemiSerif."
