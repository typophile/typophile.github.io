body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI know, I know: it's name says it all - but is this available
  for Windows? Being a lowly PC based designer, one of our client's logos is entirely
  in this. I've tried alternates, but it's almost like the Comic Sans of the Mac...
  :)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\ns"

  body: I would get an outline version of the logo created on the Mac that you can
    use in Windows based design apps. Apple tends to keep their proprietary fonts
    to themselves.

  body: It is called Chalkboard, and it is bundled with Mac OS.  I did a light google,
    and couldnt bring anything up, so you might have to bite the bullet and follow
    sii's advice.  Otherwise, use a mac.

    for you: \r\n\r\nDavid Berlow designed Gadget for Apple. He retains the rights
    to the original data. I believe he is offering to license you a Windows version
    of Gadget (known inside Font Bureau as Zenobia). So, if you're serious about wanting/needing
    a Windows version, you should e-mail him directly.\r\n\r\nExcept . . . the Contact
    feature on his profile page doesn't seem to be enabled, and he hasn't given his
    e-mail address. I won't presume to do so for him. So I suggest you contact &lt;
    info@fontbureau.com &gt; and reference this thread, if you decide to pursue this
    further.\r\n\r\nHTH\r\n"

    to do with Font Bureau.\"\r\nI've been meaning to ask if it is okay in this forum:
    \ When a user asks for authentic versions of fonts from one of our libraries,
    is it customary to offer the user help finding fonts and see if there is anything
    else? Do folks here think that's okay? or should we just leave users to their
    own devices, pirates, and in the worst-case scenario whatever-old other advice
    happens to pop-up here?\r\n\r\n(I am sorry not to have mentioned the more direct

  body: I think it's highly appropriate to mention how they can legally get a particular
    font - even from your own foundry - if the font in question was specifically requested.
    Where it gets hazy is when people ask for recommendations for a particular style.
    In that case I feel it's still appropriate but you may want to make it clear that
    you designed the font and/or have a relationship with the seller of such a font.
    And it might be nice to add alternatives to your own just to be "fair". That's
    my 2 cents in regards to David's marketing question.

  body: I sometimes ask for type suggestions for different projects I'm working on.
    The more suggestions I get, the BETTER. I don't care if the person suggesting
    the font has anything to do with its production or promotion. I realize most links
    will lead to MyFonts or FontShop, but no one is forcing me to buy from them. When
    I do purchase, I try to purchase directly from the foundry's website (if this
    feature is available, secure, and time-efficient).
