body: "Hello. I'm working on a pretty simple MT based site for a non-profit friend
  & client and want to incorporate a 3-level 'suckerfish' dropdown menu in the sidebar,
  for navigation to the various sections, subsections & some individual articles on
  the site.\r\n\r\nI've got the code, but need a bit of help to make it work correctly
  and look pretty. I will of course be happy to pay someone to help me, plus will
  buy drinks at Typecon.\r\n\r\nAnyone interested?\r\n\r\nJLT > hundertwasser@yahoo.com"
