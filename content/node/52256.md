  to buy a new font for my Mac. I've only bought a couple of fonts before but I download
  a lot from free websites. I am kind of a font maniac, as most of you probably are,
  I can identify almost any font from sight and have trouble reading books in fonts
  I dislike. \r\n\r\nAnyway, some of my favorite fonts are: Adobe Garamond, Granjon,
  and Caslon. I like really classic fonts with nice rounded question marks and apostrophes,
  and if something's too off or weird about a font I have trouble writing long things
  in it (I'm a novelist). For instance, I have Deepdene on my computer and I thought
  I would love it, but it's just too quirky for me. \r\n\r\nI'd love some suggestions
  about what I could buy that's similar to the fonts I like, but a little bit different.
  I was thinking Sabon, but I'm not sure. Any thoughts? Please, give me some of your
  fontaholic expertise!\r\n\r\n- Molly"

    If not, the student pricing on InDesign is similar to the price of a nice font
    family, and I think you'd enjoy it. Also, at least InDesign CS2 let you get Garamond
    Premiere Pro for free once you registered it.\r\n\r\nAdobe's Type Collection for
    Students is a good deal as well--quite a few good families in it.\r\n\r\nOther
    typefaces you might like: Baskerville (I like Storm's Baskerville 10 Pro the best),
    LTC Caslon (a nice Caslon), Minion Pro (has a very rounded question mark--I think
    it comes in the Type Collection for Students), and Bembo Book\r\n\r\n-Justin"

  body: "Personally I love [[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&id2=overview|Dolly]]
    from Underware (or [[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&id2=pdf|here
    for a pdf]]). I use it regularly, and it works beautifully for book typography,
    plus it is quite affordable.\r\n\r\nIf I had the money or a good project for it,
    I would also buy [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/ourtype/fresco_lf_normal/|Fresco]]
    from OurType. \r\n\r\nIf you like classic fonts, take a look at [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100020|Requiem]]
    from Hoefler & Frere-Jones. Also quite afforable.\r\n\r\nI've also been looking
    at DSTYPE's [[http://www.dstype.com/capsa.html|Capsa]]. Yet again, very afforable.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.ludwiguebele.de/item.php/Typefaces/Text/Augustin|Augustin]]
    also seems quite nice, but more angular.\r\n\r\nFeliciano Type Foundry has [[http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=22|Rongel]],
    which is also a nice classic typeface (unfortunately only Type 1 format).\r\n\r\nIf
    you want a real classic looking face, [[http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-21-jannon|Jannon]]
    from StormType could be interesting.\r\n\r\nFor more suggestions, check out the

    Bulmer</a> as being next in line chronologically, if not Baskerville.\r\n\r\nStaying
    closer to what you like, Robert Slimbach (who redesigned Garamond for Adobe twice)
    has produced two new designs in the classic old style vein, Minion and Arno. Arno
    Pro is his final word (so far) on the genre, a face of truly awesome scope. \r\n\r\nIf
    you are interested in sophisticated book typography, being able to handle such
    things as footnotes--with special glyphs for superior figures, and optically scaled
    type for the smaller text at the bottom of the page or the back of the book--then
    you need this kind of Pro (OpenType font). So I would concur with Justin that
    the route to take is via InDesign, which will enable you to set proper typography,
    and which comes with Arno bundled, AFAIK.\r\n"

  body: "Now that you've made your selection --\r\n\r\nI notice that you have both
    Adobe Garamond and Granjon, and were thinking about Sabon. These are all based
    on <cite>Garamont</cite> or <cite>Garamond</cite> fonts. The Adobe Garamond is
    probably the best in PostScript digital format. In metal -- there was no Adobe
    of course -- the Granjon was probably superior. Sabon was a compromise, designed
    by Tschichold so that the same letterforms could be set by hand, and by either
    the Monotype machine or the Linotype linceaster. It was an admirable & beautiful
    compromise; well worth it. And as things turned out, it was also one of the best
    fonts for the early Linotype digital photocomposers, such as the Linotron 202.
    For reason none of us completely understand, Sabon didn't fare so well in the
    conversion to PostScript. Sabon *Next* isn't really the Tschichold font, simply
    another Garamond revival. \r\n\r\nThe point of all this is that type is used to
    put ink on paper, and what the ink is, the paper is, and the method of applying
    it all have a considerable effect on what looks good.\r\n\r\nSo pay attention
    to how your fonts look when printed on the inkjet or laser printer, and how the
    same fonts look when printed offset, especially the Trade edition of the book
    (before the mass market edition). This is just knowledge, so if you wind up a
    successful novelist, you aren't pestering the publisher to use a font that looks
    good on your laser printer, but is rather less successful when printed offset.\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you find your interest in fonts runs deeper than that, you might consider purchasing
    a font editing tool like FontLab. You can then work over fonts -- at least, those
    where the license permits -- to your own taste and needs. Adobe allows this.\r\n\r\nWhether
    your interest in type remains one of appreciation or grows larger, good luck to
    you.\r\n\r\nCharles"
