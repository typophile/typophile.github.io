body: "I created this typeface for the masthead of a cartographers' magazine called
  \"Atlas.\" I wanted to make something elegant and soft, a contrast to the Myriad
  Condensed design the publication feutured before. I decided to use Whitney Book
  and Medium Small Caps as the secondary typeface.\r\n\r\nSo, tell me what you think\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Atlas3.jpeg]"

  body: 'I like it, although it''s a little difficult to get a clear view with such
    low contrast: white on yellow.'

  body: The only thing that bothers me is the upper story a's look like there leaning
    to the left. I think thats because they were never intended to be used in display
    sizes.

  body: "The secondary typeface looks very bad, or is that just the pdf?\r\nI like
    the characters you designed. It's nice.\r\nWhy did you draw the horizontal bar
    of the t so low?\r\nNow the t looks to small.\r\nI second the leaning to the left
    of the upper part of the a's."

  body: "Thanks for the imput on the \"a.\" The design I originally made was in much
    bolder weight, and i only tweaked it a little, I guess not enough for the light
    version.\r\n\r\nI reduced the space between the upper part of the \"a\" and increased
    the t's height and put it against blue to increase contrast. I was wondering if
    maybee I should widen the t's horizontal bar a little, you can see it up top as
    Atlas2.pdf\r\n\r\nAnything thing else would be greatly appreciated"

  body: "I opend you pdf in Illustrator and saw that the glyphs have a lot of anchor
    points. Was the original typeface a truetype? The outlines are not smooth. When
    you remove all the points you don't really need, you can control the surves better.
    Import your logo into FontLab or Fontographer and clean up the curves. Or do it
    in the program you made the logo in.\r\n\r\nPieter"

  body: "I would reduce the crossbar on the left of the t, and at the top of the l.
    The area around the lower serif of the s is a bit \"black\" (in that it's more
    solid than some of the other characters) I think you could look at reducing the
    width of the stroke as it enters the serif and generally try to get the stresses
    to marry up with those of the a.\r\nTim"

  body: "Ok, I lightened the lower serif of the \"s\" and tried to simplify the \"a\"
    and \"s\" anchor points. Unfortunately, these are simply scans taken from Streamline
    of a handdrawn image. I tried shortening the the upper \"l\" serif and the \"t\"
    crossbar, but i personally prefer them as is.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your helpful
    comments, i just looked at my first and third version and realized how much more
    refined it looks.\r\n\r\nAnything else?\r\n\r\n-Alex"

  body: "The s is a bit flat between 6 and 7 o'clock at the bottom and seems to need
    rotating slightly clockwise, you should also compare the top and bottom elements
    of the s.\r\nLooking good.\r\nTim"
