body: I&#39;ve been working with a demo version of TypeTool and now I&#39;d like to
  buy it, but I don&#39;t know which platform to use. The Mac demo I&#39;m using will
  generate font files for Mac or PC. Does the Windows version export fonts for PC
  and Mac? I have a Toshiba laptop I&#39;d like to use simply for its portability,
  but I want to be able to create fonts for both platforms. Anybody know anything
  about this?

    you make OpenType fonts you don&#39;t have any problem since they work on either
    Mac or PC

    <BR>I was afraid of that. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not able to spring for FontLab yet,
    so I&#39;m going to start with TypeTool &#40;I&#39;m a newbie&#41; which doesn&#39;t
    support OpenType. <BR> <BR>I think that&#39;s odd that the Mac version supports
    both platforms while the PC version doesn&#39;t. Must be something technical.'

  body: Acute Systems CrossFont does a good job of converting PC fonts to Mac format,
    and vice versa. There&#39;s a trial version &#40;which I believe is almost fully
    functional&#41;, but the license is only $45 IIRC. It only works on PCs.

  body: I know bugger all about Macs, but that seems kinda reasonable. AFAIK Mac files
    have a &#34;resource fork&#34; that PC files don&#39;t have &#40;this is where
    the info is in a font file&#41;. I think that PCs can&#39;t write the resource
    fork - so they can&#39;t generate Mac fonts. But the opposite doesn&#39;t apply.
    <BR> <BR>[This is mostly a guess...]

  body: In the TypeTool Mac manual PDF, it lists Postscript Type 1 for PC as an export
    option. I&#39;ve seen it in the demo, however, I haven&#39;t actually tried an
    exported font on a Windows machine. <BR> <BR>Nathan, I&#39;m going to check out
    CrossFont. Thanks for the info. Although, I&#39;m starting to think I&#39;ll just
    get the Mac version of TypeTool.

  body: I never understood why PCs can&#39;t export resource forks and stuff.  If
    you take a PC formatted zip disk and transfer Mac files to it and then read them
    on a PC, the resource fork is listed as a separate hidden folder titled resource.frk.  I
    don&#39;t see why something like type tool can&#39;t just do that. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    tried Crossfont&#39;s PC to Mac export and it didn&#39;t work for me.  The fonts
    were screwed when I was able to test them on the Mac.  It compresses them into
    an hqx or bin file which keeps the resource data intact so it should&#39;ve worked.  I&#39;ve
    only tried it the one time, so I might&#39;ve missed a setting or two.
