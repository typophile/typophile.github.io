  have ITC Avant Garde Gothic Alternates and ITC Avant Garde Gothic and yet they are
  different sizes and weights (and look fantastically ugly).\r\n\r\nAny pointers?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMike."

    of \"ITC Avant Garde Gothic\" and \"ITC Lubalin Graph\" to include 10 styles each.
    \  SoftMaker's versions of those 2 font names being cloned under license from
    Brendel - \"A850 Geometrical\" (ITC Avant Garde Gothic clone) and \"L850 Slab\"
    (ITC Lubalin Graph clone) - are both finally coming in all 10 styles each for
    the \"regular\" parts, and the small-caps parts each have approx. 2 styles.\r\n\r\nSoftMaker's
    versions of those 2 font names being cloned under license from URW++ - \"Avignon\"
    (ITC Avant Garde Gothic clone) and \"Square Serif\" (ITC Lubalin Graph clone)
    - are both finally coming in all 10 styles each for the regular, alternates #1,
    alternates #2, and old-style figured parts.   The \"condensed\" width parts of
    each font comes in 4 styles (Book, Medium, Demi Bold & Bold), and the small-caps
    parts each come in 2 styles (Book & Demi Bold).\r\n\r\nThese will appear on two
    of SoftMaker's premium-quality typeface collections - \"MegaFont XXL 3.0\" (for
    home users) and \"infiniType 4\" (for designers) - both being released in May
    27, 2014."

    different foundries.

  body: "Awesome thread.  Awesome font.\r\n\r\nNewbie question:\r\n\r\nI'm ready to
    make a couple avant purchases here, and am just wondering what you all think about
    TTF vs Postscript on these.  (were they converted from postscript to TTF or vice
    verse, etc)...\r\n\r\nEven more newbie question:\r\nI see that there is a postscript
    PC and a postscript MAC for sale...shouldn't a PC postscript work fine on a Mac?
    \ \r\n\r\nAny help greatly appreciated.  I've been doing variations of these letters
    by hand in Illustrator for too long."

    for my wife/partner and we can't figure out how they work because of what mik
    was dealing with originally. We own ITC Avant Garde which I have owned for over
    ten years. Not only can't I figure out exactly how they work but they are as mik
    said \"different sizes and weights\"\r\nI would love some direction.\r\n\r\nThanks"
