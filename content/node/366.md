    domain name at this point? maybe they sold the old one? I&#39;ll have to check
    the old address and see what happens there in the next few months. '

    <BR> <BR>For yellowblack.com it was either FontShop, the  <BR>&#34;Dummy&#34;

  body: ' The yellowblack.com domain has been advertised in the design media for the
    last couple of months. I think the idea is that it&#39;s &#34;more than&#34; fonts
    - I thought I&#39;d seen an ad that mentioned stock photography, but there&#39;s
    no mention on the site&#40;s&#41;. <BR> <BR>Many of the stock libraries are also
    now selling fonts, and some former type resellers have branched out into other
    areas &#40;FontHaus&#41;. '
