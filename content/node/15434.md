  body: "I tried it for a day (release 1) and it didn't get along with the widgets-engine,
    I guess, because these were crashing like mad on me. Also there were issues with
    auto-activation in Illustrator CS2 (FEX pointed to missing fonts but didn't auto-activate
    them, even though they were in the database).\r\nI'll try FEX again as soon as
    there's a final release, because it looks quite promising. Until then I'm using
    FontAgentPro (that has been ok for me, at least a world better than Suitcase)."

  body: "Dating back to OS 7 and Quark 3.x I have been frustrated by dealing with
    font magement issues, but felt I had to use them because i didn't want to always
    be rebooting the computer or quiting and restarting all open application just
    to make use of the fonts. After hassles using Font Book, Suitcase and Font Agent
    for OSX I have scraped font management utilities alltogether with no hit to productivity
    -- just the opposite, in fact.\r\n\r\nThis is because unlike OS9 and earlier,
    System X and all the application I use (from adobe CS to Quark 6.x to the lowly
    textedit) seem more than happy to activate and make available, on-the-fly, any
    font(s) added to any of the ...>library>fonts folders. This is akin to dumping
    fonts in the system folder>fonts folder from OS9, with the exception being the
    on-the-fly, no-reboot, no-quit-&-reopen needed.\r\n\r\nBut what about custom font
    sets, the ability to turn fonts on and off, and the need for a searchable database
    you ask? Well, I have found that any font(s) in  ...>library>fonts folder can
    be nested inside other folders and still will be activated. So I can drop a folder
    named \"design_job_1\" which contains 2 other folders named \"font_family_1\"
    and \"font_family_2\", each of which have several individual font files, into
    the ...>library>fonts folder and all the enclosed fonts, at any nested level,
    will become active yet stay happily in their enclosing folders.\r\n\r\nThis meanas
    that when I want to \"deactivate\" that custom set, I open the >library>fonts
    folder find that custom folder, remove it, and voila! the fonts become inactive/unavailable
    within seconds.\r\n\r\nThis is all made even easier by simply option-dragging
    (copying) the fonts or font folders you want activated to the >library>fonts folder
    to begin with. That way your master collection of fonts which you probaly spent
    3 summers organizing stays unaltered - becuse you're simply using it as a searchable
    database (thanks to the little search window in the upper right of the finder
    window) and then copying from it. \r\n\r\nThe last step in making this work smoothly
    is to simply drag the fonts folder you want to be activating and deactivating
    from into the sidebar of a finder window. This will make an drag-n-dropable alias
    of it that will be persistent in all finder windows from then on.\r\n\r\nNow,
    the only time I fire up one of the old management apps now is if i need to do
    a lot of on-screen previewing (which I try to avoid anyway in favor of looking
    at printed specimen book & catalogs)\r\n\r\nI really didn't think this would be
    faster, but I swear it is."

  body: "I think you're right, neumann. \r\n\r\nI tried using Font Reserve with the
    early versions of OSX and had nothing but problems. In desperation, I started
    doing exactly what you describe. I worked this way until Font Book came out, and
    now Font Explorer X. FEX seems the best yet, but you make me wonder again if these
    utilities are worth the trouble.\r\n\r\n(Everyone forgets that the original reason
    Suitcase was created was to overcome the 256 font limit on Macs. That limitation
    has never existed with OSX.)"

  body: Instead of Font Book, I think Apple should have made it so you could preview
    fonts in the Finder, similar to what happens in Windows when you double-click
    on a font file.
