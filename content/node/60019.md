  becoming a popular design exercise. I have noticed a bit of difficulty distinguishing
  between [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram|ambigrams]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome|palindromes]]
  and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome#Semordnilaps|semordnilaps]] (I think
  you need to scroll down to see semordnilap). I wonder if it\u2019s possible to design
  an ambigram/palindrome or an ambigram/semordnilap?"
