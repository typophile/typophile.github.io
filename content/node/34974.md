  so put them all here.  Let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nA short description for
  each..\r\n\r\n[[http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y239/Jumpsuit/SegMeg.jpg|Seg Meg:]]\r\n\r\nI
  really need a closer view to best view the detail on this.  Anyway, this was a font
  that came to me from my sketch book.  I like the way the two forms play off each
  other. I am anxious to use this somehow, but its going to be hard to find a good
  fit for it because it has such a different look to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y239/Jumpsuit/Retron.jpg|Retron:]]\r\n\r\n
  A short and squatty font.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y239/Jumpsuit/aeon.jpg|Aeon:]]\r\n\r\nI
  am happy how this came out.  It has a strange style going for it.  I know its not
  perfect, however I kind of like it like that.  However, if you have any ideas I'd
  be happy to hear them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere you go.  Any comments or suggestion
  welcome\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n"

  body: fyi. that aeon thing is really similar to some custom typography brody did
    for a cabaret voltaire album a hundred thousand years ago. can't remember which
    one, but i'd advise looking it up and studying his construction methods.

    has a problem with that particular file since I uploaded them all the same and
    in Safari it works fine, but I will see what I can do about that. \r\n\r\npatricking:
    Could you get me an example of that font because I am really curious how that
    looks, I can't find anything that resembles my font by searching online. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Patricking, Sorry for the late response.  I kind of see what your saying
    with the aeon typeface resembling, but not really.  Has Brody constructed other
    letters like that, or is that the only one?\r\n\r\nLex: I agree, however I am
    not at my computer right now to change, but thanks for the advice.  "
