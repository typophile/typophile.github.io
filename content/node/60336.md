  assume there are some restrictions with the filenames for image uploading. I'd suggest
  putting a disclaimer/note next to the UPLOAD IMAGE link. "

    I\u2019ve never really understood why the OS programmers even make such file names
    possible\u2014after all, they\u2019ve been involved in crafting some of the standards
    that make spaces a problem!"

    reasons to use dashes in HTML files for SEO purposes (not to mention making them
    human-readable). The rest have been adopted by nearly every OS out there, so it's
    somewhat par-for-the-course. Hence the suggestion to have a disclaimer when that's
    NOT the norm. ;)\r\n\r\n"

    Most of the web lives on UNIX servers, and a space in Unix means the end of the

    of filenames when uploading from a form (see [[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1867#section-3.3|RFC1867]]).
    In UNIX, the only characters that aren't allowed in filenames are \"/\" and the
    null character. All other characters are allowed -- although some characters might
    cause problems for certain software or require escaping.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's usually
    best not to use the filename supplied by the browser but instead generate a unique
    filename on the server when storing the file. "
