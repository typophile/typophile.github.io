body: "I'm searching for an application that can display <em>uninstalled</em> fonts
  I drop on it. I just got this Mac Pro box, and the app I used before (XFontInfo)
  is not universal binary. Anyway it would be nice to have an app that could take
  whole folders of fonts and display them, that could XFontInfo not do. I don't want
  to install Linotype's Fontexplorer as it gets in my way with its caching and auto-this
  and auto-that. Mac OS X's fontbook preview window is way to small to be usable.\r\n\r\nThere
  is a host of font viewers on versiontracker, but I have yet to find one that simply
  works. Are there any applications that you have tried and can recommend?"

  body: 'This is an interesting idea. Most font management/preview tools use ATS for
    font previews. To preview uninstalled fonts,  the application developer would
    need to have libraries that could handle the rasterization. One option would be
    to use FreeType, although I don''t know if it works with traditional Mac suitcases.
    The downside is that  the compatibility of the preview engine would not be exactly
    the same as the OS. It might offer some advantages in terms of generating specimens
    though. '

  body: "If the tool is just for Mac OS/X then it is possible to temporarily activate
    the font, and then deactivate it when the display is closed. We have made a tool
    to preview uninstalled fonts on our collection cd\u2019s."

  body: Malcolm that is too slow. The fact that no-one has done something like MacFont
    http://www.geocities.com/mixage/ for OS X yet is puzzling. XFontInfo only went
    halfway, but shows that it is possible. I am mega puzzled. I miss MacFont.

  body: Clause - speed is relative, but on our g3 & g4 macs it's more or less instantaneous.
    Not sure there is any other way to do it unless it incorporates its own rasteriser
    as canderson suggests.
