  cyrillic equivalent of the Johnston's \"Fundational\" hand or a similar humanistic
  model. You know, one if those pages showing each stroke with numbers... I have mostly
  typographic examples or ancient manuscripts photos. I need something to practice
  at home.\r\nIf you can recommend me an good an available cyrillic calligraphy book,
  it would be also very nice.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nRamiro. "

    calligraphic script, based on any teaching book (anyway, we haven't a lot of it)
    will be looked dated, even if you use some more modern, like a Villu Toots schemes

    like to share the samples Vera Evstafieva just sent me. I think they are great
    and fill a gap. It is difficult to come back to calligraphy trying to use **modern**
    post Civil Reform letters because they were quite 'artificial' and broke connection
    with written forms.\r\nBut Vera developed a very didactic and consistent model
    to teach her students. I find it also very beautiful.\r\n\r\nShe allowed me to
    share it here, but please, mention the author if you use it in any way. If you
    want to reproduce it also ask Vera.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/humanist_cyr_6039.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pointed_cyrillic_3577.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pointed_italic_cyr_5828.jpg]"

  body: "Ramiro, \u2018Cyrillic equivalents of the Johnston\u2019s \u201CFoundational\u201D
    hand or a similar humanistic model\u2019 do exist. However, to me, and to many
    other users of Cyrillic, most of them look and feel decidedly <a href=\"http://www.callig.ru/img/samples/bogdesko/bogdesco-foundational.jpg\">unauthentic</a>.
    It\u2019s just that the revival of italic handwriting, the way it is known in
    the West, never took root in the Cyrillic-using lands. After all, there was nothing
    to revive: Cyrillic italic emerged only in 1730s as a <em>printing type</em>,
    complementary to roman\u2014not as a formal, or informal, writing style. In the
    20th century there have been quite a few attempts to acculturate the Cyrillic-based
    broad-nib calligraphy at a steady stress angle. Among its proponents were Villu
    Toots, Hildegard Korger, Ilya Bogdesco, Jovica Veljovi\u0107, and many others.
    <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/54037599/Russian-Calligraphy\">Leonid Pronenko</a>
    and <a href=\"http://calligraphy-expo.com/rus/about/Reports/VideoLessons.aspx\">Petro
    Choby\u0165ko</a> are still working very hard on that. You can also find some
    interesting examples on <a href=\"http://tipometar.org/kolumne/IndexEng.html\">tipometar.org</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    find it significant that the samples you\u2019ve posted here are in fact showings
    of the conventional <em>typographic</em>, not flowing, cursive forms\u2014just
    rendered with the broad- and pointed-nib pens. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of the real-life
    pointed-pen handwriting. The style that was indeed dominant in Cyrillic penmanship,
    and taught in all schools, is this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/m_zhukov/pic/0004wqz9\">\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    Yuri Gordon\u2019s book is not about calligraphy or handwriting."
