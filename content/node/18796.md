  up buying several. I was looking for one that would match a JPEG of a poster I saw
  online at the Bauhaus Museum.  I wanted to make a reproduction of the poster. Nothing
  worked out so I spent half a day making my own Bauhaus type which I call \"Weimar\"
  in honor of the poster. Today I added Latin 1 extension glyphs.  I am attaching
  a PDF of the typeface sample which includes the little JPEG of the 1923 poster that
  got me started and the reproduction I ended up making (using my new font).\r\n\r\nI

  body: "hi chris,\r\nnice work IMO. What caught my eye on first sight is that esp.
    the punctuation marks and currency symbols (esp. the top left part of the UKP
    symbol)don't feel exactly bauhaus to me, they seem more like they've come from
    a screen font, meaning to say that, at least for my taste, you took the constructivist
    approach a little too literal/too far here. Just a thought tho. And the fact that
    the caps have no round parts at all, again in my humble opinion, does not necessarily
    mean that there shouldn't be any round parts at all, for example the copyright
    symbol, @ etc. just feel too technical/somewhat computer-related to me when strictly
    based on square and 90 degree angles. \r\nOn a different note: great to see you
    took the effort to design a german dbls, but that character/lyph does ONLY exist
    in lower case (although you can see it crammed within caps over here in germany
    every day, but that's WRONG!). German dbls is to be replaced by two capital S
    when you're setting/writing caps only, and that goes for small caps too, of course.
    But that inevitably leads to the question if you're planning to add lower case?
    I for one would love to see that, and it might be an interesting task to design
    lower case glyphs within such a formally restricted system...\r\n\r\nbest,\r\nfranz"

  body: "Ich stimme Franz zu.\r\n\r\nChris, I recently made a similar typeface, based
    on 1902 Offenbach geometric forms rather than the later strict constructivist
    stuff. In the art nouveau era, designers seemed to be less rigid, and were willing
    to break their own rules. I think that some of you non-alphabetic symbols would
    benefit from diagonals. Then they would feel old and German instead of new and
    internet-techy. If you keep the glyphs with the diagonals fat and zero-contrasty,
    I'm sure that they'll fit right in.\r\n\r\nI also heartily applaud Franz's German
    dbls comment make that two s's instead. If you really want a \xDF in your face,
    you'll have to design a complete, real lowercase to go along with it. Which would
    be super, really, although the triad combination of Uc, SC, and lc is somehow
    so NOT Bauhaus\u2026"

  body: "Oh, Chris, two more things!\r\n\r\n1. Change the name. Remember that old
    DTP rule, \"never use a typeface named after a city\"? I wouldn't want your design
    to fall victim to such retrograde silliness. Also, Weimar as a city (and even
    as a government) has such a varied, rich history. It simply cannot be distilled
    into a specific style. And Weimar was not fond of the Bauhaus when it was there.
    The Bauh\xE4usler stomped over the city's rich art historical teaching tradition
    (said the bureaucrats at the time). After four years, the city council (or was
    it the state of Thuringia?) cut all their funding. That's why Gropius moved the
    school to Dessau, where he got a sweetheart deal with the city's Mayor. How about
    a name like \"Weimar School\" or \"Weimar Poster\"? That last one would be a double
    whammy with internet searches. And keyword the font with \"Bauhaus\"\u2026 then
    money will pour in.\r\n\r\n2. Put this font on MyFonts.com ASAP. You'll probably
    want to do some minor tweaks to its design, but really, this isn't such a time
    consuming face. But I bet you that it will sell on a platform like MyFonts, as
    long as you keyword it right and give it a nice font flag (something with that
    Bauhaus head\u2026).\r\n\r\nOK, I really shouldn't be giving you this much free
    advice."

    other Dan - some of the nonalphabetics look too much like pixels and not enough
    like type furniture; you're almost there though.\r\n\r\nThe \"upside-down\" B
    is a great idea and you've done a great job of balancing it, but does anyone else
    think it looks a little dark?\r\n\r\nAll in all it's looking pretty sweet. When
    I try to draw letters like these, I always run into trouble with the D and O,
    V and U, R, and X. I like your solutions for all those letters; I'll have to crib

    no additional language support. Another has swashes, ligatures, alternates, CE

    context should make things clear. I think it's very unlikely a face like this

    double-S when setting (small) caps, most professional applications like quark,
    indesign, illustrator, which allow you to convert text from upper to lowercase
    and vice versa, do this automatically, so i can't say for sure if a dedicated
    double-S glyph is actually necessary? don't know what happens if the converting
    of cases is done via opentype featuritis, so you might be right there to do one,
    i am sure somebody else has it down precisely...\r\nmeant to give you another
    \"go for it\"-like remark, but things don't look as if you'd really need one \u2013
    well done!\r\n\r\np.s. isn't it amazing how relatively well legible such typefaces,
    which, compared to 'proper' ones, are pretty \"crude\" formally, can be at smaller
    sizes? strikes me every time i see something like this...and the overall strong
    graphic appearance of a column of smaller text \u2013 great as well."

    on a platform like MyFonts.com, \"Pro\" can't hurt, can it?"

    character set with broader language support rather than an Adobe thing only. My
    assumption is that people from the countries who don't get as much choice in type
    will perhaps be tempted to give it a second look. Not that this font has a big
    use scale because it is display, but the broader common market usage across cultures
    may be a selling point--perhaps more for my text faces though.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    of standardization in description is important for our customers. AFAIK, Adobe
    originated the term, but it can carry a specific meaning (i.e., CE inside), and
    it has already been semi-universally adopted.\r\n\r\nAs we know, OT does not always
    equal OT. Just because an OpenType font can have up to 65,000 glyphs does not
    mean that it will\u2026 most still have around 200\u2013300. At least with terms
    like \"Pro\", your average buyer knows a little of what to inspect when he installs
    the font. I think that the more our customers know, the happier they will be\u2026
    and maybe they'll buy more fonts! \r\n\r\nErr\u2026 well, it *could* work, couldn't

    the Adobe connection, the term \"Pro\" is standardised in that buyers are more
    likely to recognise it as having an extended character set than any other term.

    is very probably antithetical to the core inspiration of your type face. On the
    other hand sometimes good things come from tweaks and exceptions in type.\r\n\r\nI
