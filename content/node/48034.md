body: "This was the type on the spine of an old book that I need to ID. Can anyone
  help? It has a lot of Goudy and Garamond characteristics, but the \"a\" throws me.
  Any help would be awesome.\r\n\r\n(Sorry for the choppy sample - I have the cover
  type but it is all caps.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/teach_4620.gif]"

  body: Do you have a sample that perhaps has greyscale, and not just black and white?  Some
    of the important nuances about this face are quite difficult to ascertain with
    the pixel distortion.
