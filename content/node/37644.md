body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI have serious trouble in understanding this thing about the
  naming of the glyphs (and all the other in my eyes too complicated stuff about all
  the naming in a font.-).\r\nIn certain situations- please don\u2019t ask me how
  it came up - I found myself a glyph board like the one below. It has large designs
  so the letters are not visible in the whole. Tried thousand numbers in thousand
  menus to make it fit without success. ;-)\r\nBut this is not the problem here. What
  makes me sick is in this case my \u2018R\u2019 It has the strange name _0082 or
  something like that and if I want to change its name FontLab cancels it from its
  place and throws me at the end (and its not possible to paste it away from there!)
  where I absolutely don\u2019t want to have it and where besides it doesn\u2019t
  work any longer with the R-key for example in the metrics window. How can I achieve
  that it stays where it is meant to be in between Q and S and is named R and comes
  out pressing the R-key? Would be a miracle! Why couldn\u2019t the FontLab programmers
  not do a simple thing as it was for decades in FontStudio? I wonder about the sense
  of all the complications.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nStefan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-2_5753.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-3_5265.gif]"

    I have told you in a recent post, you should't create standard characters from
    scratch. They are all already prepared with the right names and unicodes.\r\nI
    would strongly suggest to start over. \r\nFile->New \r\nYou empty font should
    look like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild1_4499.png]\r\n\r\nYou
    can then copy and paste your glyph R from the old font to the slot named R in
    the new font and it should work as expected."

  body: "Which glyphs appear in the font window and where in the sequence they are
    located is determined in the encoding file. The encoding file is a simple text
    document that lives in the following directory:\r\n\r\n<code>    MyHD / Users
    / UserDirectory / Library / Application Support / FontLab / Encoding</code>\r\n\r\nTo
    build your own custom encoding try this: Duplicate one of the existing files,
    change the file name and the unique number in the first line of the document and
    insert your own fonts name like this:\r\n\r\n<code>    %%FONTLAB ENCODING: 11005;
    MyFabFont</code>\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will see that it is very easy to change the order
    of the glyphs or to add a glyph in the desired spot in the sequence like this:\r\n<code>\r\n
    \   F\r\n    G\r\n    G.alt\r\n    H\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nIn case of doubt the FLS
    manual is a super resource (p.152).\r\nGood luck.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Hannes,\r\n\r\nthanks, sounds very interesting! Seems you know something
    about it. \r\nI will try this. For now I helped myself as adviced above by creating
    a new standard font and copying the glyphs into it. Yet, as a solution it felt
    strange. Yours seems to be worth a try.\r\n\r\nStefan"

  body: "Stefan,\r\nIf you open any of the standard encoding pages in FontLab--for
    instance Latin Extended A--you will have a prebuilt encoding in proper naming.
    You simply draw your glyphs in the boxes with the names that coincide. Be sure
    you have the naming set to name instead of unicode so the names show up.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
