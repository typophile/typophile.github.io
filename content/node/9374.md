  body: I like the play with the negative space. But I think the type has no character.
    It might sound obvious, but try FF Signa instead. <BR> <BR>BTW, what about putting
    four sigmas together somehow, maybe as four sides of a square? I would look like
    a snowflake &#40;maybe too much like the Utah Olympics one?&#41;, assuming that&#39;s
    relevant - your colors <i>are</i> pretty chilly! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: i like hrant&#39;s suggestion about the snowflake of sigmas. <BR> <BR>and
    you should definitively drop arial; Signa is a great font, and i would test a
    geometric sans like Avenir, Kabel, or Proxima too. <BR> <BR>finally, you could
    also reconsider the position and proportion of the text &#40;i think it could
    come under the logo, left-aligned with the Q&#41; and reduce the tracking. <BR>
