  It has been used here in Australia as the main titling font for the 2004 Sydney
  Festival. You&#39;ll see samples used throughout their website <a href="http://www.sydneyfestival.org.au"

  body: Thanks fontdude &amp; Yves - but please call off the dogs on this one. We
    have had success tracking down the designer of this typeface and it was a custom
    job specially done just for the 2004 Sydney Festival. Good call by Yves. I have
    been speaking with the designer by email and he hasn&#39;t properly named it yet
    but is thinking of calling it &#34;Festival Sans&#34;. It&#39;s not commercially
    available yet. Sorry for wasting anyone&#39;s time but maybe this will help someone
    else down the track if they are trying to ID the same font?
