body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI've been tasked with finding a new typeface to use in this
  company logo; for better or worse the client has decided to go with the red, halftone
  drop shadow version, and I'm worried about the legibility of the current text, particularly
  at small sizes.\r\n\r\nIt's for a local production company, the rest of their branding
  has a pop-art/Lichtenstein-esque kind of theme. This logo will be reproduced at
  a number of sizes, the smallest probably being on their business card, and it will
  also be reproduced on screen in a motion graphics context -- so needs to scale reasonably
  well for TV.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any suggestions for a font (or a better way of resolving
  the white/black layering)?\r\n\r\n(edit - for some reason can't get Insert Image
  to work, so jpg is attached)"

    extremely simplified version (i.e. no drop shadows, highlights, etc.) wherever
    the other one would lose those details.\r\n\r\nAs for typeface, I'd suggest hand-lettering
    at a small size, using comic books as a reference, then scanning and tracing as
    a vector.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. If you didn't want the client to go with the
    halftoned version, why did you show it to them? :-P"
