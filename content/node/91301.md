body: I am using CG Futura Maxi of various weights for a client and they need to purchase
  a legit copy for official use. While researching where this font can be purchased
  all I am coming across is free font sites... could this really be the source? Does
  anyone know the ACTUAL source of this font? And further what does CG mean? Crappy
  hack of a great typeface? Thanks gang!

  body: "CG stands for Compugraphic, which made photo-typesetting equipment in the
    last half of the 20th century. They were bought by Agfa, which later merged with
    Monotype.\r\n\r\nI have the light and demibold versions of Futura Maxi from way
    back. If Monotype doesn't have them, I don't know who would."

  body: Thanks everyone, I think at this point the best option is go with the PL version
    and forget about CG. Appreciate it!
