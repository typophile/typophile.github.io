  body: "And if you would like the more complete, original which contains a serif,
    sans serif, and alternate version, look at Mason, which is available from Emigre
    or through MyFonts. As far as I am aware, Mason is the original and Morpheus is
    a blatant, near copy of Jonathan Barnbrook's work. Mason came out in 1992.\r\n\r\n<a

  body: That's interesting. From what I am reading, the change came about because
    of sensitivity to the association with Charles Manson. I wonder if this is the
    real reason or an urban legend. Seems to be the only reason I can find. Thanks
    for the tip.
