body: ' I&acute;ve tried generating every possible kind of font file from Typographer
  but I just can&acute;t get any of them to install with suitcase on Mac... Please
  help me with this one. I don&acute;t understand macs that well, but I should know
  how to install one on a Mac. This however isn&acute;t the case with the files that
  Fontographer exports. What I&acute;ve got so far are files called: <BR> <BR>Font$
  <BR>Font.afm <BR> <BR>Could someone direct me to a tutorial page or somerhing? '
