    was integrated into the OS. <BR> <BR>Also I think it might have to do with more
    people switching to Suitcase or Font Reserve

  body: of course we don&#39;t know how it works yet, but i&#39;m pleased to hear
    that i might have a replacement for suitcase finally.  my only two qualms about
    moving to os x were the lack of quark &amp; atm deluxe.  one of those problems
    was just solved, and hopefully apple font book will solve the other.

    <BR> <BR>Suitcase has its problems, but it has worked well for me so far.

  body: I made one of those flash font browsers for myself a couple months ago. I&#39;ll
    see if I can find it to post here. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s is fancier than mine though.
    Mine showed every single font on the system, even those little weird ones that
    are an intricate part of the Windows XP system that don&#39;t seem to serve any
    purpose except to take up space and memory. I wonder how they filtered those out.

    <BR> <BR>It looks kind of anti-aliased on my system--same set up as yours. More
    like OS9 anti-aliasing with terrible spacing. Some of the characters get clipped
    in odd ways, too. Tom&#39;s has better spacing. I think the Flash Player/Plug-in
    on OSX is a Carbon app and/or does not use the Quartz rendering engine.
