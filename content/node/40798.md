    Designer and we'll be redesigning the GW websites, don't worry. As for the logo,
    they want to keep it pretty close to what they currently have, so I don't know
    how they would feel about a rippling brook, but I can always see what they say.

    or \u201CSteinbach Online\u201C and not \u201CSteinbach Online.com.\u201C Get
    that tagline out of the logo, too. All of the extra crap in the current logo makes
    it look like the company behind the logo is run by people who were too stupid
    to let the people paid to design the logo actually design the logo.\r\n\r\nAs
    for typefaces, first you need to figure out what kind of feel you want this logo
    to have. Sit down with a thesaurus and start creating long lists of words and
    synonyms until you just can\u2019t do it anymore, then put the whole project away
    for a day and then refine the list. Once you know what you want to evoke, sit
    down and start looking at fonts to find some that echo your sentiments. Test the
    word or words that will go into the logo in every font that fits. Pick the ones
    that work and look over them again. Keep refining. Then it\u2019s time to start
    tweaking letters and such."

    other files on my thumb drive so i'm saved there too.\r\n\r\nI'm reinstalling
    the Tiger OS onto my laptop and after that I'm re installing the Leopard OS so
    I can run time machine and get my old information and programs back, so hopefully
    by later today I will have this logo ready to make changes to. \r\n\r\nI think
    that it is a cleaner look to the logo, but hopefully they don't go ape over the
    missing \".com\". I think it really makes the logo without it. What are your opinions
    on the 2 lines in the box? Or the type below the \"steinbachonline\"?"

  body: "It's a general rule to not mix sans serif typefaces in copy- the same goes
    for logos with taglines. I suggest making the tagline a serifed typeface for contrast's
    sake. Your kerning is off throughout the logo itself- the S is pulling away, and
    the space between the N and the B is off. The shape of the B is weird, as well.
    The mark you've thrown in there is too low-contrast (and looks like a low-rent
    version of the Fila logo). \r\nIf I were you, I'd kill the mark, then vary the
    weight between \"Steinbach\" and \"Online\". Make Steinbach heavier, as that's
    what's important."

    me in the right direction and be meticulous about my work. I tightened up the
    \"s\" as well as the spacing between the \"n and b\". I realized that I was using
    a file with the \"b\" that I started editing. If you notice in the first logo,
    there were no stems on the \"n, a, and b\". I added the stem back to the bottom
    of the \"b\" which I feel makes it fit in with the rest of the letters again.
    \r\n\r\nI'm having trouble picking out a clean looking serif font, so I was just
    wondering if anybody has some suggestions what might look clean and modern. The
    logo does remind me of the \"fila\" logo now that you mention it. If you have
    suggestions for the font of the text below, i'll play with some different weights
    and upload a new file.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\nChris"

  body: "It worked better when you were mixing Avant Garde and Myriad. Not mixing
    sans faces is usually a good policy because the similarities between sans faces
    can create a sort of dissonance in which the viewer can\u2019t figure out why
    the words don\u2019t seem to work together. But in a case like this, where there
    is strong contrast in size, form, and the contrast of case, there is no dissonance.
    In Myriad, the tagline, also feels much more subservient to the rest of the logo,
    whereas in Avant Garde the all caps seem to be screaming for attention. \r\n\r\nI
    think that you did a very good job with the logo mark\u2014it can stand on its
    own in places where the wordmark is inappropriate. I would keep it on the right
    to really anchor things. "

    to something bolder (a black), headline version of the contrasty sans used in
    the original, with more contemporary flavor. Such as a Quadraat Sans Black (if
    such an animal existed). Or a punchy headline sans like Knockout Ultimate Welterweight.
    Whitney Condensed Black.  And then possibly try Online in a light, maybe monoline
    script. Like a more flowing version of Handsome Pro Light.\r\n\r\nMaybe the script
    idea won't work. But shoot for contrast that says \"bang\"\r\n\r\nWhatever you
    do, it should have some personality. This feels like you opened up a font, typed
