body: "Ok here goes.  I'm trying to create a print for my newborn nephew.  I found
  one online that I like [[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2mpAVWyCHoAb1poemNJRWdGN0E/edit]]
  however I want to change the wording a bit to make it a little more personal.  I
  LOVE the \"little boys/best ones\" font but I've tried a few different search engines
  and can't quite find exactly what it is or anything similar.  Moreover, I *swear*
  I've seen it before on the cover of a magazine and I can't place it (googled the
  heck out of most of the magazines I read as well to no avail)!!  Either way it's
  driving me mad and any help would be greatly appreciated.  Anything close - curvy
  and bubbly like that - would be fine.  The only similar styles I have found as of
  yet are straighter and more boxy.  \r\n\r\nThank you all in advance for your time!!"
