  body: "There is an old metal type called Super, designed by Arno Drescher in 1930,
    which matches all the details of this lettering. The squared M with raised crotch(unlike
    Futura), the curved t (also unlike Futura), the high waisted R, the g, e and c
    terminals -- it was as close as I could find. If it had been from an Italian foundry
    I would have been sure of it, but it was from Shriftguss, a German foundry. I
    found this in the Jaspert \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\".\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Looks like it could be Arno Drescher's \"Super Grotesk\", revived by Nicolai
    Gogoll as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/drescher-grotesk-bt/|Drescher
    Grotesk]] for Bitstream. FontFont also have a version of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-supergrotesk/|
    Super Grotesk]].\r\n\r\nSee an interesting comparison here: [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Futura-vs-Super-Grotesk/1549769]]"

  body: Bitstream version also has Drescher Grotesk BT SmallSizes (with ink traps),
    a cool addition.

  body: "Thanks for the swift work on this. It is greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nGogoll's
    Drescher Grotesk feels a little too contemporary for my purposes. Svend Smital's
    FF Super Grotesk is perfect.\r\n\r\nI have another related ID request for you...
