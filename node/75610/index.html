  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It&rsquo;s time I return to some basic experiments after (truth be known) struggling with less governed attempts at designing glyphs. Therefore I am trying to get to grips with a simple sans face in which the majority of contours are formed by expanding paths with minimal optical adjustment i.e. slight variation in stroke width/height. No doubt this is the kind of typeface you have seen many times, happily or otherwise.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to I extend some of this crude logic to the typically tapered joints. Clearly this is not achievable with expanded paths as it produces <!-- raw HTML omitted -->aligned extrema<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where they ought to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sheared<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (provisionally laid out in blue). What functions are there to aid construction of contours for a branched joint? I use the term construction because I readily admit to being humbled by my attempts to draw freely! For this thread at least may the eye inform the position of any central path (free, adjusted optically) but let the computer produce the contours (constructed accordingly).</p>
<p>Here is a very basic /u/ to introduce my problem, the central path is in red. What informs the provisional blue contours in a generic grotesque /u/?</p>
<p>I added a fictional gauge ball to help imagine what might govern the blue contours in a physical manifestation. Despite the red path being divorced from a physical implement, such as a pen, assigning an imaginary form allows me to imagine how the contours might form. This imaginary &lsquo;tool&rsquo; would be required to vary in height (to accommodate adjusted thickness) and shear on it&rsquo;s path (to accommodate the taper) simultaneously and smoothly. Which functions might I use to translate this fictional sentiment to the digital design? If these functions are not available in FontLab should I be looking to scripting solutions and parametrics? Please, feel free to correct my imagination.</p>
<p>I hope that you can guide me to some solid resources and that this thread develops in earnest.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Some of these have extra points between the extremas - I don&rsquo;t think this was usually a conscious design decision. Probably those points were added in conversion.</p>
<p>Looking at your example and these - the leftmost set of points might want to be slanted too.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for responding Brian. Studying various grotesque alphabets confirms the conventions but doesn&rsquo;t give much away about how the contours are formed - I suspect that in all of your examples they are determined by eye and iteration.</p>
<p>A broad nib pen moving along a central path informs the contours of calligraphic lettering. A traditional grotesque font is an abstract interpretation of this image - these fonts were conceived as outlines from the outset. However, the computer allows us to, where appropriate, reinstate a direct relationship between contours that is longed for when working with outlines only - the crudest expression of this is an /o/ constructed with two parallel paths but naturally this particular function can&rsquo;t cope with more complicated situations.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am not searching for a holy grail solution to stroke fonts, just different functions to aid consistency between various components. I hope that somebody can point me in the right direction.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to focus too much on the /u/ as this kind of joint is common to the /n/m/r/b/d/p/q/g/a/. It is because of this recurrence that I am keen to find functions capable of generating contours from a central or single path in each incidence.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;the computer allows us to, where appropriate, reinstate a direct relationship between contours that is longed for when working with outlines only&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I would debate that such a «direct relationship» between the contours is necessarily «appropriate», or desired, or even «longed for», in a sans. (If you make an extremely pen-informed font that may be different.)
I would rather see the necessary optical corrections, like the thinning you show, as reasons to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->deviate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from any sort of «monoline» ideal. For one thing, if this is the way you&rsquo;d like to construct a font, how do you intend to account for the necessary different thicknesses of vertical and horizontal strokes?
It seems to me like you&rsquo;re clinging to a logical model that you don&rsquo;t need to need.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably the case in all the best typefaces. You can certainly expand paths using a non-uniform brush (Illustrator I believe has quite powerful functions to this effect) but you&rsquo;d have to tell it which paths to expand and contract in the &lsquo;right&rsquo; places and at what rate (for example the SE curve of u needs to thin much more than the SE corner of an o, and different again for a d)&hellip;so you&rsquo;d end up iterating anyway.</p>

<p>Of course I want to produce an optically adjusted font. It is precisely because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don&rsquo;t want to produce a monoline font<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that I started this thread. I thought I&rsquo;d managed to make that clear initially!

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How do you intend to account for the necessary different thicknesses of vertical and horizontal strokes?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Even the basic expand/parallel paths function can accommodate this adjustment as there are input values for height and width!</p>
<p>Back to my original questions:
What informs the position of the sheared BCPs on the tapered strokes?
How can I translate this sentiment using functions applied to a path?</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;ve managed to clarify my questions. It&rsquo;s much harder to make myself clear in a forum than if I were sat opposite you with a pen and paper sketching out my concerns!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would debate that such a «direct relationship» between the contours is necessarily «appropriate», or desired, or even «longed for», in a sans.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>If possible I&rsquo;d like to avoid debating here, we can start another thread for that! Right now I&rsquo;m asking for technical advice, and I don&rsquo;t want debate to obscure that. Please trust that I already have some sensibilities!</p>

<p>This is the kind of intelligent function I&rsquo;m getting at, thanks Ben. I know I will be tidying up in the end, that&rsquo;s not a problem. I know that I can&rsquo;t apply one function to all parts of a central skeleton path but I could certainly apply different functions to separate sections of this path and join them myself. Powerful functions are what I am interested in, even if it is necessary to apply them to very specific areas individually. Maybe working on this level is akin to drawing in speed, but for me the advantage is that I&rsquo;d only have to edit the central path directly and keep varying the function until it felt right, this suits my way of working!</p>
<p>Are there similar but more powerful functions than expand/parallel paths in FontLab buried in the macros somewhere? I&rsquo;ll have a look at Illustrator in the meantime.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Andrew, thanks for starting this discussion!  I am also very interested in these issues.</p>
<p>On a related note, I think the joining of the straight part of the u to the curve is also a tricky thing.  As shown in the images posted by brianskywalker, sometimes the points are horizontally aligned, sometimes the inside is higher, sometimes the outside is higher.  I think the appropriate choice is highly dependent on the &ldquo;shear&rdquo; of the bottom that you mentioned.</p>
<p>A short discussion of these issues appears in a thread I started a while ago: [[http://typophile.com/node/64835|Aligning points on outline of straight to curved stroke]].</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Brian, I&rsquo;m really glad that you uploaded that image of Replica as that is exactly what got me thinking about a hypothetical variable gauge ball. The Replica ball accounts for adjusted stroke width and height as it travels from vertical to horizontal. I then tried to imagine what kind of movement and transformation the ball would have to make to negotiate the tapered joint of a lowercase letter, in the case of my example a /u/, and I concluded it would have to shear to achieve this. Also I imagined that the ball would get slightly wider to produce optically adjusted width in the curved stem of a character such as /R/. Looking at the above image I think NORM chose to standardize this but there is no reason not to add more &lsquo;standards&rsquo; to achieve a more adjusted font. For example, maybe for a /B/ the ball gets a fraction wider again for the lower right hand extrema.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m talking about a hypothetical, flexible gauge. Maybe I have to tell it how to respond to different scenarios, for different components of letters, based on our well established optical adjustments, but it will nevertheless inform the inside and outside contours by following one path and producing contours either side based on parameters. If this hypothetical &lsquo;clever gauge&rsquo; was a function in software, which function is it?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Stephen, glad you found this interesting, I just linked this thread to yours. Hopefully we can evolve some solutions.</p>
<p>I also dared to mention a pen - this seems to induce some skepticism from Nina in both threads ;-)</p>
<p>The reason I mentioned a pen was because I enjoy the fact that the inside and outside contours are related. I want to achieve a more complicated relationship between these contours than produced by a fixed width traveling at a fixed angle.</p>
<p>That is not to say that I want to make a calligraphic font. I want to make a sans serif font on a computer - that is why in my mind&rsquo;s eye I replace the pen with this ball. This imagined &lsquo;ball&rsquo; is more flexible than the pen in the hand, it does not need to be kept at the same angle like a pen does and it can change in width much more than a nib splayed by pressure - on a computer it is not bound by physicality! Again, I don&rsquo;t want to get into the philosophical rights and wrongs of this - there are plenty of fonts on either side of that debate - I&rsquo;m looking to make something that reconciles the two, a midpoint - and I need to find the tools to do it. Often on Typophile the &lsquo;why&rsquo; stands before the &lsquo;how&rsquo; but I&rsquo;d like to reverse that order here. It&rsquo;s often easier to ask why than to explain how!</p>
<p>I think I need to add some more illustrations.</p>

This is where the pen allusion ceases to be relevant and some kind of variable gauge more appropriate.</p>

<p>You can also easily recreate something like the Replica example, in Illustrator, with a &ldquo;scatter brush&rdquo;:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Brian. I&rsquo;m not trying to reproduce the artwork for Replica. That image is important to this thread because it reveals parallel paths - the circles are just illustrative. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The circles allow us to see what is going on between the contours.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> They illustrate, rather than plot the contours. I want to plot the contours. The moving ellipse is just a way of us humans engaging with two abstract lines by aiding our imagination in how they might relate.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A hypothetical ellipse that transforms smoothly along a single path would always plot smooth and corresponding contours from its extrema.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Maybe this is not the optical ideal, but it&rsquo;s what I am endeavoring to produce nonetheless!</p>
<p>But this is working backwards. I am not trying to invent a function based on the a moving ellipse - I imagine a function capable of tackling my problem already exists - a function where more parameters than height and width can be stipulated when expanding paths. The function does not have to be intelligent enough to know which set of parameters to apply to different parts of the curve, I can expand them separately and specify the parameters such that the ends of each segment correspond.</p>
<p>I fear I am struggling to convey my ideas.</p>

<p>On that note though, those gauges were only ever meant for just that - gauges. Knowing how to do them in Illustrator means you can use them as intended.</p>
<p>I think with art brushes you could easily replicate your examples, and then reuse those art brushes on other glyphs. I&rsquo;d like to show you how, but I don&rsquo;t have time. You might be able to figure it out yourself, perhaps? If you need explaing of the custom brush tools, just look up tutorials and they should explain.</p>
<p>Also just remembered that there is a plugin for illustrator that does thinning and expanding of strokes - without converting them to outlines. Can&rsquo;t remember what it&rsquo;s called though. Using art brushes would still do the job, though, but that plugin might better work for what you want.</p>

<p>Brian, thanks for the time you have invested in this thread. I&rsquo;m going to spend some time looking at all the possibilities of brushes and plugins in illustrator, which without your recommendation I might have discounted too easily. If you remember the name of that particular plugin add it to the thread in the future.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I recently did some experiments with the variable stroke feature. And I think it is more or less useless because you can not really define mono-thick lines which come after a line that gained weight. Plus you have to edit more points to get the same result as you would have to with the outline approach in fontlab.
And if you finally have an Illustrator result that you like and want to make it bolder it will just give you bad results.</p>

Maybe you should also have a look into <!-- raw HTML omitted -->kalliculator<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Frederik Berlaen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

		<div class="commentbody">As Hrant says, Noordzij&rsquo;s model of the stroke only takes you so far. It seems to me that while Romain du Roi, Metafont or expansion/translation/rotation models do produce sort-of usable results, true Design comes in when you move away from these limiting geometric, modular or algorithmic approaches, and start to draw things optically, with new ideas, critically. I think type design is way too interdependent and complex to reduce that way: the human eyes have to be the final arbiter in all decisions, no?</div>
