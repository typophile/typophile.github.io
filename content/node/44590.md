  body: "thanks for the suggestions; I might just have to get the sharpie out and
    start experimenting, 'cause nothing I have seen in my search has the right feel.\r\nI
    did find ClickArt\xAE Fonts 3 Deluxe (sounds cheesy, I know) which has many options,
    however, it is for PC only. Does anyone know what this collection of handwritten
    fonts is and where to find something similar for Mac? "
