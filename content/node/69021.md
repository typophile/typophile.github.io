  I need to add an item to the main menu. Unfortunately, I don't know which font the
  original designer used. I can't seem to ID this font on What The Font, but it looks
  very similar to Arial Black or Helvetica. The lower case e's and a's are different.\r\n\r\nHere
  is a link to the main menu on the home page:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ursulavonrydingsvard.net\r\n\r\nAnd
  here's a link to the main menu image:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ursulavonrydingsvard.net/0_a/inc/main/1050/t_logo.gif\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone help ID this?\r\n\r\n"
