  body: As you can embed subsets of the font in any final product, I don't see why
    file size should be an issue. Can you elaborate a bit on what the problem is?

    it doesn\u2019t match precisely \u2013 in terms of weight and metrics.\r\nMyriad
    is (has been) available as a [[Multiple Master]] font. Maybe you can generate
    your own Myriad that matches Kozuka?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/koz-myriad_3459.png]"

    what's the Latin bit of Kozuka Mincho based on?

  body: I agree, Christian, the file size shouldn't be a concern. And I noted that.
    Still, it makes no sense to me why the whopping 5.3 MB is required for a medium
    weight font that looks similar to a number of others. For example, thanks to Florian,
    I see where KozGoPro is a near match with Myriad Pro, yet my open type file for
    Myriad Pro-Regular requires only 78 KB. I guess what it comes down to is that
    I'm compulsive about wanting to keep my installed fonts as lean as possible.

    is a typeface intended for setting <em>Japanese</em> text. The number of glyphs
    it contains is at least an order of magnitude bigger than the one for a latin
    script font like Myriad."

  body: "What Riccardo said. In numbers: Kozuka Gothic contains 15.713 glyphs, Myriad
    a mere 842. By the way, Myriad is not just \u2018Latin\u2019, it covers Greek
    and Cyrillic aswell. And the file size of Kozuka Gothic is not just due to the
    East-Asian characters (although that makes for most of it). It also holds scads
    of circled, squared, bracketed and reversed figures and letters, box drawing glyphs,
    full sets of rotated glyphs and italics, etc.\r\n\r\n@Dave (dtw), I doubt that
    there\u2019s such a direct link to a \u2018stand-alone Latin\u2019 for the Laton
    part of Mincho, as it is the case with KG and Myriad. If there was any Adobe typeface
    involved at all, it might have been Utopia."

  body: "All six weights of Kozuka Gothic Pro (and Kozuka Mincho Pro for that matter)
    are based on the Adobe-Japan1-4 character collection, and include 15,444 glyphs.
    However, the font being discussed is the \"Pro-VI\" version, which is based on
    the much larger Adobe-Japan1-6 character collection that includes 23,058 glyphs.
    (The \"Pro-VI\" versions have since been replaced with \"Pr6N\" versions that
    include the same glyphs, but are JIS2004-savvy.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, about Myriad being
    used for the Latin glyphs of Kozuka Gothic, that is true. And, I should point
    out that Myriad MM was used, and in addition to selecting an appropriate instance,
    the resulting glyphs were also scaled. Below is what we used for each of the six
    weights:\r\n\r\nExtraLight  Myriad MM Weight=140 Width=600 Scale=112% (102% vertical)\r\nLight
    \      Myriad MM Weight=250 Width=580 Scale=113% (102% vertical)\r\nRegular     Myriad
    MM Weight=340 Width=560 Scale=113% (102% vertical)\r\nMedium      Myriad MM Weight=480
    Width=530 Scale=114% (102% vertical)\r\nBold        Myriad MM Weight=620 Width=500
    Scale=114% (102% vertical)\r\nHeavy       Myriad MM Weight=750 Width=470 Scale=115%
    (102% vertical)\r\n\r\nBut, back to the original question and concern: if you
    want to use the Latin glyphs in Kozuka Gothic, the easiest path is to simply use
    Myriad Pro. ;-)\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior Computer Scientist, CJKV Type Development\r\nAdobe

    part and only in Extra Light. I plan on using Myriad MM (Multiple Master) as explained
    in this article and a tool such as Typetool http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/
    that should be able to do so as mentioned on page 80 of its manual : http://www.dtpsoft.de/downloads/manuals/TT3MacMan.pdf\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I can't find Myriad MM font anywhere. Or at least the real one. I've been able
    to download so-called Myriad-MM.ttf but I am not sure they actually are real Multiple
    Master fonts. When I open them with Typetool I don't get the pop-up I'm supposed
    to have if I trust what's written on the manual.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any idea
    where I can find the real Myriad MM ? If you can tell me how can I check if the
    font I found is indeed a Multiple Master font ? What is multiple master fonts
    file extension by the way ? is .ttf possible ? If you can tell me how I am supposed
    to use Typetool or any other tool out there that could help me.\r\nI read that
    Open Type fonts are the next generation of Multiple Master fonts... can this be
    achieved using Myriad Pro ? Or do I really need to find Myriad MM if I want to
    recreate Kozuka Gothic Pro Extra Light ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, I am completely
    lost, I've been looking for a long time and I can't find any answer...\r\n\r\nNick"
