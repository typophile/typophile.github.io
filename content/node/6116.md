body: Hi all. I&#39;m currently working on a logo for a friend who is launching a
  small mens clothing lable. the client requires a strong masculine mark/identity
  that reflects the brand name, GUNN. This is the current direction im working on.
  any comments/criticism are appreciated   <BR>cheers. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42959.gif"

  body: Very bold and militant! Is this appropriate to the clothing in anyway? ie.
    Is fashion of the clothes inspired by army uniform. <BR> <BR>I like the mark,
    maybe join the G and U.

  body: I think you might need to thin out the crossbars on the &#34;N&#34;s. Right
    now the right side of the logo is much heavier than the left. Connecting the &#34;G&#34;
    to the &#34;U&#34;, as Alex suggested, might help also. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: 'It would be nice to see the Logo an the appropriate label. I&#39;d rather
    disjoin the letters. If the label is on the right fashion it will fulfill it&#39;s
    purpose. But to stay readable the disjoin would be my issue number one.  <BR>
    <BR>Another thought: Try to make it as unreadable as possible &#40;maybe make
    another horizontal line straight through the crossbar of the G&#41;, this will
    strenghten the stylish-fashionized approach. At least till you have to redesign
    the mark in a few months. <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik'

  body: hi all, thanks for the quick feedback. ive been trying to fix that prob with
    the weight. ive thinned out the cross bars and added a little weight on the g
    and u and tried some connections of the g and u... but feel the connections affect
    the legibility, which the client is concerned about. ive also reversed the logo,
    as a possible option &#40;also to see how it affects the weight changes&#41; <BR>

  body: A logo is just one thing, maybe you should show us some samples how the corporate
    indentity will be. <BR> <BR>What kind of photographs will be used for advertisement
    ? <BR> <BR>What are the colorschemes ? <BR> <BR>Etc. etc. <BR> <BR>A sturdy logo
    can be adequate, solong it works in combination with all other elements within
    the corporate ID. <BR> <BR>regards, Jacques

  body: I think the G is too complex. Perhaps simplify to better match the other letters?
    I thought of another option of joining the forms with bars instead of connecting
    them individually as well. <BR> <BR>This logo could work very well as a fashion
    hang-tag. <BR> <BR>Nice strong design elements. Keep up the good work. <BR> <BR>-C

  body: Hey David, nice design so far. In my opinion, the version without any letters
    joining was the best one you sent us. I personally find that those joinings resemble
    serifs, and I find it somewhat strange to have serifs only in a certain part of
    the letter. <BR> <BR>So, in my opinion, you should either keep them separated
    or REALLY join the letters, like using the same stroke for the right part of the
    &#34;U&#34; and the left part of the first &#34;N&#34; &#40;like putting one letter
    INSIDE another&#41;. This second option would, of course, result in an somewhat
    abstract/low-legibility logo, but which I think could work, since you&#39;re working
    with fashion. <BR> <BR>My 2 cents, <BR>Lucas
