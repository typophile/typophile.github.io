body: I&#39;m working on a sans serif design, not quite mono-lineal, some humanist   <BR>structure
  but no humanist modulation, and I find myself constantly   <BR>questioning if I
  have drawn my shapes correctly. When setting sample   <BR>words, some parts of strokes
  appear thicker and some thinner. Parts   <BR>that would normally be made thinner
  by the shape of the pen, the upper   <BR>left and lower right of the &#39;o&#39;,
  right stroke of &#39;v&#39;, appear thick. Where I   <BR>might expect a thickening
  of the stroke, lower left and upper right of   <BR>the &#39;o&#39;, left stroke
  of the &#39;v&#39;, I see instead a thinning.   <BR>   <BR>Am I mad or is this a
  common experience? I imagine that my mind   <BR>&#39;expects&#39; the normal pen
  based modulation that I&#39;ve been accustomed   <BR>to working with in my past
  few projects and is reacting against the   <BR>mono-linearity of this new design.
  I&#39;m finding it very distracting   <BR>and I don&#39;t know what to do about
  it except to keep measuring all   <BR>my strokes to confirm that they are in fact
  the same width.   <BR>   <BR>Ideas? Similar experiences?

  body: Hi Aaron. You&#39;re definitly mad. So am I :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Are you designing
    on screen? If so, do printed letterforms have the same issue? The trouble I&#39;ve
    had designing onscreen is by the time you zoom out to get a sense of the whole
    letter &#40;or even a word&#41; the anti-aliasing starts messing with my mind
    as you&#39;ve described. While I still design on screen, there is an element of
    trust in your measurements untill you pull a print.. <BR> <BR>In your sample,
    the only one that looks off is the v. If anything the thick should be on the left.  <BR>
    <BR>Good luck. <BR>Randy

  body: '&#62; Are you designing on screen? <BR> <BR>Yes <BR> <BR>&#62; If so, do
    printed letterforms have the same issue? <BR> <BR>Not that I&#39;ve noticed, so
    if so, it&#39;s not as strong. I&#39;ll give it a <BR>look when I get home. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; In your sample, the only one that looks off is the v. <BR>&#62; If anything
    the thick should be on the left. <BR> <BR>I first noticed the effect with the
    v; it seems strongest there.  <BR>According to my theory, the left stroke should
    appear thin. <BR>After repeatedly seeing &#39;v&#39; with conventional modulation,
    <BR>thick on the left, thin on the right, by comparison a mono- <BR>lineal v will
    seem <i>too thin</i> on the left and <i>too <BR>thick</i> on the right compared
    to what your brain has <BR>become used to. <BR> <BR>When I resumed work on this
    design last night, after <BR>reading around 50 pages of Adobe Garamond, the effect
    <BR>was very evident. Looking at it today, it&#39;s not quite as clear <BR>in
    the round characters, still somewhat visible in the v. <BR>Maybe that&#39;s the
    lesson, don&#39;t try to be original after <BR>extended reading or your gut feeling
    will tell you to make <BR>your design look like the typeface you&#39;ve just been
    <BR>immersed in.'

  body: You&#39;re not mad and this is quite common. I find that even the slightest
    &#39;correction&#39; for this, i.e. the slightest modulation, will compensate
    to produce the appearance of an unmodulated stroke. The likeliest explanation
    for the phenomenon &#40;and ghost modulation is quite a good term for it&#41;
    is that we are so accustomed to the &#39;normative&#39; forms of our letters being
    modulated, and in a particular way, that our minds reject the absence of modulation
    and see, instead, a reverse modulation. The effect is most obvious in letters
    with &#39;mirrored&#39; forms, e.g. <i>A O V o v;</i> in Tiffany&#39;s illustration
    above the effect is much less troubling in the <i>d.</i> I suppose if one was
    exposed only to totally unmodulated letterforms for an extended period of time,
    one would eventually be &#39;cured&#39; of this phenomenon, but how likely is
    that? It is sensible to introduce very minor modulation to counter the perception.

  body: When I was reading Smeijers&#39;s &#34;Couterpunch&#34;, in the chapter about
    adding something to the lc &#34;j&#34; to make it sit on the baseline&#42;, my
    mind started thinking about &#34;reform&#34;, and it immediately hit me that the
    Latin lc &#34;a&#34; is facing the &#34;wrong&#34; way! I  now realize that it&#39;s
    not so simple, but the power of suggestion is indeed powerful. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    BTW, I don&#39;t know if he realizes it, but that sort of thing is totally contrary
    to his otherwise highly conservative approach to type design! <BR> <BR>&#62; we
    are so accustomed to the &#39;normative&#39; forms of our letters being modulated
    <BR> <BR>I think that&#39;s part of it &#40;especially for a type designer&#41;,
    but there are [probably] optical issues as well - just like a perfect circle/square
    &#42;appears&#42; imperfect. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    fair to call this an optical issue, not just a matter <BR>of familiarity. It&#39;s
    likely similar to color fatigue, where the <BR>world looks blue after you&#39;ve
    spent a couple minutes <BR>wearing yellow sunglasses. But I also think that since
    we <BR>spend so much more time reading modulated text than we <BR>do wearing colored
    sunglasses, the effect is more <BR>permanent. <BR> <BR>&#62; I find that even
    the slightest &#39;correction&#39; for this, i.e. the <BR>&#62; slightest modulation,
    will compensate to produce the <BR>&#62; appearance of an unmodulated stroke.
    <BR> <BR>And it seems you&#39;re not alone. Myriad compensates for this <BR>effect
    in both the o and v. Adobe&#39;s Frutiger compensates <BR>only in the v, but does
    so quite dramatically. Agfa/ <BR>Monotype Gill Sans compensates in o and v. Linotype
    <BR>Helvetica Neue compensates only in v. Neufville Futura has <BR>no compensation
    at all. <BR> <BR>So it appears that I should add some optical compensation <BR>to
    my design. Seems to be standard best practice today for <BR>the most common digital
    sans fonts.'
