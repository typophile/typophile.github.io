  &#34;I partied last night with Zapf Chancery&#34; shirt that would be a great gift.
  <BR> <BR>Stupid, yes--but you&#39;d have to know them. <BR> <BR>Anyway, figure this
  is a 1-in-1000 shot to see if anyone knows where this shirt comes from.  But if
  anyone would know--wouldn&#39;t it be the typophile forum? <BR> <BR>Thanks for tolerating
  my &#40;idiotic?&#41; request...

  body: Linotype was selling shirts in Uniglo &#40;japanese gap like store&#41; in
    Wimbledon London with its fonts on them for a retro look. I don&#39;t remember
    seeing them in Zapf Chancery but it&#39;s very likely.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/48279.html?1094799554"
