  body: Can't find a perfect match that could fit at the same time both /S with horizontal
    terminals and /R disproportional bowl... As alternative, I suggest [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/font/T1052/signal|URW++
    Signal]], used for French highways and road signs. I like also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/saa|Saa]].

  body: "The main thing that is distinctive is the _R_, which is found in a few fonts
    like Arboria Bold -- already suggested by Kevin -- GT Walsheim -- already suggested
    by Riccardo -- and Neutra Display http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Neutra+Display&q=Go
    The other letters are pretty common, including _S_ which is similar to Helvetica,
    Chalet, Newhouse, Nimbus, Pragmatica, Arial etc.\r\nperhaps the closest out of
    the box is GT Walsheim which hs both a similar _R_ and a somewhat  similar _S_.\r\nDon"
