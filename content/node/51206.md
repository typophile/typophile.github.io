    idiot- Yes Man Movie poster. Another clue - Jim Carrey. \r\n\r\nI'd just got out
    of bed, my brain wasn't in gear. Message to self - never post replies before coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick

    messed up the poster to cobble together more letterform examples.\r\nThe un-altered
    poster looks really nice, and can be seen here:\r\nhttp://yesisthenewno.warnerbros.com/)"

    pics are from a rather peculiar permanent exhibition at The Wellcome Trust on
    Euston Road in London. They are made out of some heavy-duty material called Corian
    that looks like marble. I'd love to have one of those letters.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
