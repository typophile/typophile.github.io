  the movie \"Lord of War\".\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lordofwarthemovie.com/\r\n\r\nYou can
  view the typeface throughout some of the video shorts. It is a slab serif font,
  but I am not yet skilled enough to pinpoint the name."

    first. I was rushed at the time.\r\n\r\nhttp://members.optusnet.com.au/~pilantra/lord-of-war-type.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
    typeface I refer to is the one used for the opening titles. For the actors and
    production. \r\n\r\nThis sample is very small, all I can do is identify it as
    a hybrid sans and slab serif."

  body: "Gareth, I'm not seeing any \"slabbiness\" in your sample. Looks like a geometric
    sans to me.\r\n\r\nAgency (Font Bureau), Stratum (Process Type Foundry) or Refrigerator
    (Mark Simonson) will get you close.\r\n\r\nYou might also search Myfonts with
    terms like \"constructivist.\""
