body: I've put negative left sidebearings on my 'j' and (descending) 'J', which works
  well except when those glyphs start a line, in which case the tails stick out past
  the left margins. Is there a better solution as far as setting up the font goes?

  body: "Well, there will always be some of that, just like with an \"f\" ending a
    line. And all in all, I think it preferable to use less negative sidebearing &
    kern as needed. There are other constructions that might cause problems, such
    as \"f_ space_J\", as in \"of Jewish descent\".\r\n\r\nIf you try this with, say,
    Bulmer, which has a large negative sidebearing with the j's on the left and with
    the f on the right, the wordspace almost disappears.\r\n\r\nYou can use an alternate
    J,j, with less of or no negative sidebearing as a contextual alternate when preceded
    by a space, but I don't know how that will work at the beginning of a line --
    certainly it wouldn't work as the first character in a paragraph.\r\n\r\nUsually,
    all the clever sidebearing ideas we come up with to avoid kerning with a lot of
    letters come back to haunt us.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: Is there such a thing as a null char, so as to make pos null J +x possible?
    Or after a cr lf, perhaps? Although that'd be problematic for the first line.

  body: "Craig,\r\n\r\nThe solution just occurred to me. Karsten Lucke use to recommend
    that in a case such as this, you make the \"standard\" character (the encoded
    one) the \"exception,\" then using calt, switch to a desired alternate.\r\n\r\nSo
    yes, you could make the standard J/j with about -20 units left sidebearings, then
    set up a class with all the alpha-numerics with your -80. Check leading punctuation
    while you are at it, I bet you find that things like an asterisk, colon, etc.,
    work better with the -10 or -20 character. You will still have to kern the j with
    parenleft, bracketleft, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to get the \"j\" too tight. I once
    set a book on Hemingway & wound up cringing every time \"Kilimanjaro\" appeared
    in the final, printed book. That has become my test word, BTW.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "> the tails stick out past the left margins\r\n... They should. I mean you
    put them there to make the letter balance in it's default space and though they
    may look to you like they are sticking out, to readers, I think it's just fine.\r\n\r\nOr,
    you can make not a few, but dozens of alternates, as the opposite effect occurs
    as well, with e.g. a non-descending J and many other characters, and then make
    lots of OT, and then think there is too much space from the margin to the main
    stem of the J compared to the line below which starts with an \"L\". :-p\r\n\r\nCheers!"
