  and I was really blown away by the quality of his typefaces, particularly Stuart
  and Bonesana. I was suprised that I had never heard of him nor his Nonpareille foundry
  before and  I wonder if he is just not very well known, or I somehow missed it.
  I'm just curious if anybody here knows any good examples of his work, or perhaps
  has used his typefaces. Any personal opinions or other reviews of his work are also
  appreciated. http://www.nonpareille.net/typographie/index.html\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance,\r\nJasper de Waard"

    known. I bookmarked his website a certain time ago and several times I found typefaces
    of him on blogs:\r\nhttp://www.slanted.de/eintrag/bonesana-pro\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/person/Matthieu_Cortat/\r\nhttp://typographica.org/category/designer/matthieu-cortat/\r\nhttp://abcdarium.de/matthieu-cortat/\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    I don\u2019t know him personally but in a future project I would like to work
    with one of his typefaces.\r\n\r\nGreetings, Roland"
