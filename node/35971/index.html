		<div class="commentbody">The kgreenlandic (kra) has a lowercase form only. Good question as to what to use in a small caps setting (or in an all caps setting, for that matter). We&rsquo;ll need an expert to weigh in, but other than avoiding such a setting, my inclination would be to design a usual kra glyph that matched the height of the small caps (typically slightly higher than x-height) and another to match cap height. But that might be seen as incorrect by native users. Just looking at Minion Pro, I don&rsquo;t see anything other than the normal x-height kra. The kra is now replaced by &ldquo;q&rdquo;.</div>

 As concerns the letters [[http://www.typophile.com/user/14455|eigi]] mentions, code points like U+01F0 [ǰ] are considered compositions (eg., of j + ◌̌); the small-caps version should just combine the small-caps j with U+303C Combining Caron. Abusing the IPA small-caps, it should look something like [ᴊ̌].</div>

<p>I have been increasingly convinced that a seperate Small cap font rather than a single font containg Roman Caps &amp; Small Caps is a good idea anyway since Indesign &amp; other apps don&rsquo;t have a very elegant way of handling the issue yet - and may or may not evolve one. Do you agree?</p>

There are a few archaic Greek &ldquo;single-case&rdquo; letters also: historically, only one form was ever used, but Unicode, being a two-case system (yo Eben, don&rsquo;t get me started) calls forth the other.
So the question is, who is going to design the glyph?
Do type designers leave it to the orthographers, who will likely (e.g. Everson, SIL) just add some kind of tick mark? (Pardon me, &ldquo;diacritic&rdquo;:-)
I say, if we have to make the damn things, we should at least be allowed a little fun and invention!</div>

<p>Samuel Kleinschmidt, who introduced the pre-reform Greenlandic orthography (and the one responsible for the kra, if I understand correctly) in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fTcLAAAAQAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=samuel+kleinschmidt&ots=atOPD5ofol&sig=x0J701F5KhYnXXY8mjKuoF4DAgY#PPA175,M1">his 1851 Greenlandic grammar</a>, doesn&rsquo;t seem to have cared about capitalization. I&rsquo;ve skimmed the contents at Google Books, and nowhere does he seem to use capitals for any Greenlandic words. His German is far more sparse on capitals than I am used, for that matter.</p>
<p>I tried to find examples of Greenlandic books in the pre-1973 orthography at Google Books, and found <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fiETAAAAYAAJ&q=Av%C3%A1ngarnisalerss%C3%A2rutit+K'anak&dq=Av%C3%A1ngarnisalerss%C3%A2rutit+K'anak&lr=&pgis=1">this example</a> which has the form K’ânâĸ (Qaanaaq in today&rsquo;s orthography) with what looks like a modifier letter apostrophe. So score one for SIL. This is just one example, though, and it&rsquo;s a rather small sample size. I would like to see more, but it&rsquo;s difficult to find a fully browsable book written in pre-1973-orthography Greenlandic at Google Books for copyright reasons.</p>
<p>I did find <a href="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&id=VkYaAAAAMAAJ&dq=subject%3A%22Greenland%22&q=diary&pgis=1#search">this snippet</a> of part of a map with &ldquo;K’ânâĸ&rdquo; written by hand, but it&rsquo;s too small to see what&rsquo;s really going on in there with the diacritical marks.</p>

So this issue is likely something that conforms to its own set of conventions, and Everson and SIL are not arbitrarily inventing anything. They are merely describing what seems to have been standard practice.</p>
<p>Nick: <cite>This is so obscure you could probably set your own standard.</cite>
This is a whole language and a literary tradition you are talking about. Do you think type designers should disregard the accepted practices just to have fun in designing a new glyph, which would only serve to cause confusion in the representation of historic spellings? At least the German eszett is still in use so the possibility is there for a gradual acceptance of a capital form.</p>
<p>The archaic Greek letters pre-dating the bicameral divergence of the Greek alphabet are a fun challenge for type designers, because there is a need for them, as you said. That&rsquo;s where we can exercise creativity and work toward building up some kind of consensus. The Kra doesn&rsquo;t need our help.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I would suggest eliding the diacritic with the letter.
That would avoid the mark bumping into the diacritic on a following letter.
Also, changing the nature of the top right serif from the standard upper case form of K (borrowing from, say, C) would provide consistency with the lower case treatment. I mean, the lower case character isn&rsquo;t just a &ldquo;k&rdquo; with a diacritic, is it?
<img src="/images/old-images/Kras_6601.png" alt="">
But this is hypothetical, there are other more useful characters to put in fonts!
Thomas Phinney made a good point in his blog, when discussing which Cyrillic characters to add to a font, that using the number of speakers of a language is a good criterion. So if there are a lot of speakers, it&rsquo;s useful to support a language. And perhaps also if it&rsquo;s endangered. But really, what possible use is there in retconning a deprecated glyph?</div>

<p>Really it&rsquo;s just historical fiction, although I do like the Marxist overtones of &ldquo;revisionism&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It is important to consider that a language with not a ton of readers &amp; not a a ton of books was probably given less thought &amp; consideration typographically speaking than other languages. It seems likely to me that the glyph design solutions they evolved might be a bit too slapped together and could stand being reconsidered especially if it was done in a manner that was culturally historically sympathetic. Acknowledgment that a given solution is <cite>completely legitimate</cite> doesn&rsquo;t preclude new ideas. How do you know that the Kra couldn&rsquo;t be helped? I don&rsquo;t! The world can&rsquo;t be split into simply retroactive continuity vs. simple revisionism. Insisting on this split takes your eyes of glyph designs and therefore real consideration of the issue.</p>
<p>What is the population of readers of this glyph set anyway?</p>

<p>Kra was phased out of the official Kalaallisut orthography in the early 1970s, so the only time one is going to find it used to today is likely when one is attempting to faithfully reproduce older works. It would seem to me that a reconsideration of its design would be at odds with that goal.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it is a mistake to place the apostrophe mark over the left stem of the n like this, Cristobal. The old Afrikaans character U+0149 is not a letter with a combining mark it is, as the Unicode name indicates LATIN SMALL LETTER N PRECEDED BY APOSTROPHE. It has a compatibility decomposition to U+02BC (spacing apostrophe modifier) followed by U+006E (n), and the Unicode special casing rules indicate that the uppercase form is U+02BC followed by U+004E (N). In other words, the typical rendering for this diacritic character should be identical to ’n and ’N.</div>
