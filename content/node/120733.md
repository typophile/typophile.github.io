body: "I just saw the following post: http://typophile.com/node/119543\r\nI was going
  to comment there with some shameless self-promotion, as the postwar theme relates
  strongly to what I've been doing in the past weeks. However, I wanted to give so
  much background information that it would just be embarrassing to present that in
  the aforementioned thread.\r\n\r\nFirst off, I'm going to tell something about the
  project so if you're only interested in the typeface, scroll down.\r\n\r\nI would
  like to present a preview of a typeface I have almost finished which is based on
  the Helvetica model. It's not an alternate though, as it's an ultra black display
  variant. In the last weeks I've been working for Stedelijk Museum Schiedam for a
  school project. Each group was assigned a different section of the exhibition \"Ik
  hou van Holland\" (I love Holland) \u2014 Dutch art after 1945. http://www.stedelijkmuseumschiedam.nl/nl/tentoonstellingen/nu-in-het-museum/334-opening-ik-hou-van-holland-21-september-2013\r\n\r\nOur
  group was assigned the Soft Living section which was about the 60s and the Cold
  War. It showcased works like 'The Soft Living Room' by Maria van Elk, 'TV as a Fireplace'
  by Jan Dibbets, 'Signing the sky above the port of Amsterdam by airplane' by Marinus
  Boezem and 'Teaparty' by Bas Jan Ader.\r\n\r\nThe brief was to develop a project
  to promote the museum and to have a way of measuring the increase in customers.
  After extensive research on the museum, the exhibition, the artists and their mindset
  and the 60s, we decided to design a newspaper as this correlates nicely with the
  mass media which came to prominence in the early 60s. We discovered that many of
  the sentiments of the 60s  are still prevalent today and in fact there is a cycle
  of repetition regarding politics and civil rights movements. In fact as of August
  2014 we entered into a second Cold War. We collected literature from the 60s and
  used this as a canvas and added a second layer to give insight into how the 60s
  correlate to our time. For example, we used one article on Frank Zappa with the
  title 'This man is very dangerous' and we made a collage where the name Zappa was
  covered by Obama's name, thus changing the nature of the article entirely. Another
  example is putting images together to add meaning, like putting pictures of the
  Dutch feminist group Dolle Mina's next to Pussy Riots and Wonder Woman, thus implying
  feminist groups to be the defenders of the public.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I also did research
  on the typefaces used in the 60s and typefaces used by newspapers. Obviously by
  the end of the 60s Helvetica became very popular and I particularly noticed Helvetica
  Condensed Bold being used for headings. I didn't really want to use authentic typefaces
  though; the newspaper had to be somewhat authentic to the 60s but with a twist.
  As such the idea arose to design an ultra black display typeface based on the Helvetica
  model, which we were going to use for the branding of the newspaper and our project
  as well as setting some of the headings.\r\n\r\nI decided on the name Zwartika because
  'zwart' is Dutch for 'black', and the name brings up an association with swastika,
  which I think is just for a propaganda kind of typeface. Zwartika is just about
  done and I'm almost done with Giltika, which is a more playful variant which is
  a little step into Kayo's (Gill Sans Ultra Black) direction. I only developed Zwartika
  for the project though, but currently I'm expanding the typeface. I have the design
  of Zwartika Regular and Italic done and of Giltika Regular and Italic, though I
  have yet to turn the italics into a font.\r\n\r\nI gave Zwartika away for free at
  the art academy as a one-time offer but I intend to sell an extended version and
  Giltika soon on MyFonts. As such it seems like a good idea to ask for some criticism
  now. It's very late, but I rather do it now than not at all. \r\n\r\nI'm also uploading
  documents of the project for those who are interested. The Soft Living research
  and presentation documents are early on in the project, so we were thinking of different
  concepts back then. 'Presentation Stedelijk Museum Schiedam' is the final presentation
  I gave to the client. We had an exhibition of the project with a newspaper stand
  and newspapers which I printed in risograph (which was often used in the 60s apparently).
  The client and the teachers then selected the projects they thought were best and
  wanted to know more about and those projects did a digital presentation to compliment
  the exhibition. I will post a few pictures of our exhibition separately."

  body: I think it's a very cool display font with lots of personality. No doubt it
    will sell a lot.
