  body: "(I wrote these answers while Mike was posting, so there may be some redundant
    info.)\r\n\r\n<em>1. Should I test them in fontbook or suitcase I have different
    results in each.</em>\r\n\r\nReinstalling a different version of the same font
    serially will result in problems because of the various font caches used by OS
    X. There are several strategies that I know of.\r\n\r\nOne is to avoid font managers
    and install fonts directly into the Adobe's private Font directory ([startupvolume]/Library/Application
    Support/Adobe/Fonts/). This means your fonts are only available to Adobe apps,
    but the apps don't seem to have cache problems when you use this approach.\r\n\r\nAnother
    strategy is to change the name of your font every time you generate a new version.
    You can install such fonts any way you like, but it's an extra step to keep changing
    the name.\r\n\r\n<em>2. Exporting as .otf. Is there any benefit to .ttf</em>\r\n\r\nIt
    depends. If you are working with Type 1 curves (beziers) there will be a conversion
    process when you save as TTF which you don't have direct control over. Also, hints
    will be automatically converted to TT instructions, again without your direct
    control. Neither seems like a good way to test. If you are working in TT curves
    and building hints with TT instructions, that would be different.\r\n\r\n<em>3.
    Would like them to be a true cross platform font (reason for using opentype).
    Is this too lofty of a goal. I have heard of many problems with this. Solutions?</em>\r\n\r\nIt
    is possible. There are some good tips on the FontLab forum, written by Adam Twardoch.
    Look in the \"Tips\" section. Particularly look at the article about naming. (Mike
    linked to this above.)\r\n\r\n<em>4. My kerning pairs don\u2019t show up when
    using them in an application. They are as if I didn\u2019t make any. what am i
    doing wrong?</em>\r\n\r\nIt could be that you have not built a \"kern\" feature
    for your font. There is an option to do this automatically when you save an OpenType
    font. It's better to do it manually by using Class Kerning. It's not exactly obvious
    how to do this. Here is the procedure:\r\n\r\nCreate your left and right glyph
    classes (see the manual on how to do this). Kern the primary glyphs using the
    Metrics window. IMPORTANT: Make sure you don't do kerning pairs for any other
    glyphs. Do \"Kerning Assistance...\" from the Tools menu. Click on the \"Apply
    and Save\" button. Now you will have your \"kern\" feature. You need to do this
    whenever you change the kerning.\r\n\r\nAn additional step if you have more than
    100 class kerning pairs: Insert \"subtable;\" about every 100 lines in the kern
    feature definition. If you don't, you will get erratic kerning in non-Adobe applications.
    I don't know why this is, but it works.\r\n\r\nOne more thing: The old-style kerning
    table is ignored in CFF OTF fonts.\r\n\r\n<em>5. I have fonts with light, medium,
    bold, etc. When turning them on it doesn\u2019t seem to recognize the whole set
    some are missing. I have read through many posts and the manual can only get it
    right with luck it seems. help?</em>\r\n\r\nSee Adam's article on naming mentioned
    above.\r\n\r\n<em>6. When typing with the fonts and the weights do show up there
    is for example a line of text in bold and a line in regular. When they print,
    they come out the same, either both bold or both regular\u2026 WTF?</em>\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure, but it is probably a caching issue. The methods I explained in my answer
    to question #1 should help with this."

  body: "The kerning table/kern feature thing gave me problems for a while when I
    first was using FontLab a year or two ago and generating OT fonts.\r\n\r\nMy understanding
    is that kerning tables are not saved with CFF OTF fonts, although I think it is
    possible. Even so, you don't want to do it.\r\n\r\nAlso, look at your kern feature
    after it is generated. If you see any pairs which directly reference glyphs. For
    example:\r\n\r\n\_\_pos A T -30;\r\n\r\ninstead of\r\n\r\n\_\_pos @_kernlA @_kernrT
    -69;\r\n\r\n_kernlA and _kernrT are classes; A and T are just glyph names. For
    reasons I don't understand, if any entries in your kern feature are NOT classes,
    there will be problems in some applications. The way to remove the non-class pairs
    is to go through your kerning pairs (open a Metrics window; click on the little
    K to activate kerning; click on the \"Kerning Dialog\" button to the right of
    the button with the red X) and delete any pairs in which either side is not the
    primary glyph of a class (that's the one which comes first in the class and has
    a tick mark ['] next to it).\r\n\r\nAfter doing this, redo the Apply and Save
    thing. Keep doing this until you only have class-based kerning pairs in the kern
    feature."
