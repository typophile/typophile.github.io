body: Can I get some suggestions on a couple typefaces when you think of the words
  "Aztec" and "Mexico"? One direction I'm looking into is using the Aztec pictogram
  (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-mexican-relics/p22-mexican-relics/)and some
  type that would go with it. The other direction is just getting the feeling of the
  mexican culture.

    a lot of culture and to be represented by pictograms may be appropriate in some
    instances but may be like putting boots on a Texan who lives in the city.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.visitmexico.com/work/sites/Visitmexico/resources/Banner/13585/logo.gif"
