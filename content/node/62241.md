  identifying typefaces so I feel a little bad asking, but any help would be very
  much appreciated and I will try to post more, not just ask for help. I am working
  on a Hindu wedding program for a friend who is North American marrying into a Hindu
  family. I have spent hours researching typefaces trying to find one that has a Hindu/Eastern
  flavor but is not too over the top. I would like to find a nice script and a serif/sans
  to go with the script but have not been having much luck. I would love any suggestions
  and or a suggestion as to what the attached is the word 'Hindus'\r\n\r\nThanks so
  much for any help,\r\nCheers, Leigh"
