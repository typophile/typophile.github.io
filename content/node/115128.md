  body: "Interesting. I checked the screen shot and the letters are monospaced. \r\nFrom
    Kobi Benezri's website http://www.kobibenezri.com/ we learn that he developed
    the sans monospaced font Lettera for Phaidon  based on a mid 70\u2018s typewriter
    font designed by Joseph M\xFCller-Brockmann for Olivetti. Later he also developed
    a proportional spaced version Lettera Text. Lettera is sold by Linto http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Typewriter+Fonts/Lettera/\r\nUnfortunatly,
    while the sans monospaced font in the screenshot looks generally like Lettera,
    it has some significant differences: semi squared sides on letters such as O and
    C, and a few serifs: base of r, y  and Y, top of J. Lettera could be modified
    to make a reasonable facsimile. \r\nThe search continues.\r\nDon\r\n"
