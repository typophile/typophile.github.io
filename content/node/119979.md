    Unpublish a thread  and then bounce the offender ...I do what I can. I have no
    idea who else is helping out.\r\n\r\nI'm here in the EST and check on each forum,
    including Blogs about three times a day..."

    site. I visit Build and General Discussions fairly often on a daily basis, and
    TypeID less frequently -- and I hate spam.\r\n\r\nIf you need a new mod for that
    purpose -- and that only -- all you have to do is ask me."
