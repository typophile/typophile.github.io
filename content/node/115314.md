  like to know what the font is.\r\n\r\nI've tried various tools to try and work it
  out, but I just can't seem to find one that matches. I think it may be in italics
  (I'm not sure if it's tilted by default), but I don't know if that affects the tools
  or not.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\nThanks in advance."
