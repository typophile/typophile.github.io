    uses some automated-voice audio to complement its navigation. personally i think
    this site is real neat &#40;although far from intuitive, especially since they
    added that thing that looks like dried figs&#40;?&#41;&#41;. the fact that it&#39;s
    in flash does a few things, 1&#41; make it inaccessible to those with disabilities
    &#40;and in fact there&#39;s some &#34;braille&#34; graphics on there that are
    just silly for a blind person to whom they&#39;re useless&#41; 2&#41; allows the
    designer to implement interesting layered audio on a web at tiny file sizes, the
    handy thing &#40;you may know already&#41; with flash/audio being you can make
    even a tiny invisble swf and stick it somewhere on your page, and flash compresses
    and exports .wav files as mp3 which is very cool. the site also has other environmental
    audio &#40;which does not turn on and off&#41; which imo is gentle and restrained,
    as well as more ok than some seeing as it&#39;s a music label site.  <BR> <BR>also,
    germane but not exactly related to your questions is this article i just found
    on &#34;voice font&#34; technology: <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/14214.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/14214.html</a>; since
    css 2 allows us to make aural styles &#40;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/aural.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/aural.html</a>&#41; for those using
    speech synthesizers i guess these are being called aural or voice &#34;fonts&#34;
    ... interesting.  <BR> <BR>hope this was remotely useful.'

    <BR> <BR>One of the best uses of Flash I&#39;ve seen. <BR>It&#39;s in Portuguese
    though, so some of you might not understand it very well.
