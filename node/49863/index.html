  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Yep, that's what I'm gonna do. Don't even try to stop me.

The inherent problem with the number 9 is that it looks just like the number 6. I'm putting this on my inner forearm, right before the elbow. If I'm sitting at the computer, elbows bent, the bottom of the 9 will face the desk. I'll be looking at it upside down so it will probably look like a 6 to me.

Wondering if there is any font that is clearly a 9 vs. a 6. I'd like something a little rockabilly-ish looking, but not a 9-ball or something like that. Just a 9, plain and simple. 

I also like the way Garamond has a break between the ball and stem of the 9. 

Thanks for any feedback. </div>

Not that it would ever matter, not like anyone would know that. But I would know it, and it would bug me. 

I kinda like the idea of a plain 9 as well. Here's a couple 9's I'm digging:

		<div class="commentbody">Here are a couple of other possibilities:

1. Use lower-case roman numerals: ix

2. Combine the numeral and the name (Eva and Tony don't have that). You could use a larger number with the word nine spelled out below and surrounded by a box to make it look like a flash card, or if you used rounded corners on the box you could make it look like a playing card -- if that appeals to you. Or you could curve the word around the top of the number.

Please take to heart the earlier advice of others to choose your tattoo artist carefully.

Think you are going to struggle to find a typeface that will achieve this. The problem is that the elements that make a '9' be a nine are the same factors that are used to make a '6' be a six. Thus changing any of the elements i.e changing the straightness of the leg on the '9' will only ultimately change the 6 in the same way. Saying that I do think that it is possible to make the mark more like a 9 instead of a six, but not enough to use on its own.

From what others have suggested I think possibly having a dot after the number will work best. At first I thought the roman numeral idea might work, but then realised that in fact IX(9) upside down is actually XI(which is 11), so might no do the job unfortunately. 

Good luck. Let us all know what you decide to do.</div>

As Andy Griffiths points out, using all cap roman numerals will not do the job, since upside down they would read as 11. That's why I originally suggested lower-case roman numerals (ix) which do not read as anything upside down.</div>

Think this is a pretty good idea from Clint-Anglin, might be worth checking whether lower case numerals can be used though. If so, this could be a good solution.

Alternatively, you could always create the '9' using 9 objects, i.e circles or blobs.

True enough in general, however if it's a type tat you want there's artists that specialize in that, and it'd be my obvious direction if i were getting numerals or lettering. FWIW there's also a fair number of oddly weighted A's in typefaces as well, having it done in tattooing is most likely due to not flipping the stencil beforehand.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the great ideas. Great forum here. I love the domino, the flash card and the 9 out of 9 dots. My wife is firmly against the ix, even though I think it may be the best idea. 

The reason I wanted to get a 9 is that my son and I were born on the same exact day, December 9th. Pretty cool, and kind of unique. My son is half Mexican (my wife) and half white guy (me). She suggested I get the nine written out in Spanish.

nueve

I like that idea. 

Now I just have to find the right font. I'm tempted to go all Mission San Francisco Latino gangster and swirl it up, but as an average white guy, that's not really my style. I can't seem to find a Latino font that looks like anything but a Chevy's restaurant menu item. So sad.  

Should I just go Helvetica?
