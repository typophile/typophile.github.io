<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm working on a book project and the editor has asked to include a handwriting typeface for central character. I've searched most of the free sites and pay sites, but the scripts that are good enough (opentype with ligatures, etc.) tend to be a bit too refined for a pre-teen girl. I must admit I'm a bit stuck.
Her handwriting will likely go up to 3 pages and we need to include "reluctant readers," so legibility is important.
I've managed to find two that come close to filling the job:
<a href=http://www.dafont.com/jennifer.font>Jennifer's Hand Writing</a> (captures the age)
and <a href=http://www.dafont.com/lauren-c-brown.font>Lauren C. Brown</a> (the legibility is decent)
Neither have ligatures, so will require a lot of grooming that I'd love to avoid. I also don't mind paying for the font if it's the right one. I know that open type will be opening up doors, especially for script fonts, but I haven't seen anything that fits this niche.
Help?

<div class=commentbody>If you're doing 3 pages and the readership is broad I would avoid a connected script. Print writing, like those you've mentioned, will be much more readable. Also <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_providence_sans/>FF Providence</a>, <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/andy/>Andy</a>, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=felt%20tip">Felt Tip</a> or <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_zemke_hand/>ITC Zemke Hand</a>.
To avoid shape repetition you can move baselines a bit and flip symmetrical characters, but at 3 pages you're going to have a lot of the same letters regardless of how many alternates or ligatures you have. Readability is most important.
Alternatively, you can pay a bit more and have your ideal <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/services/handfont.php>font created from scratch</a>.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The Amy Papaelias site is funny, but not quite what i was looking for :)
And Olga has a bit too much variation in the x-height and character weight to sustain a few pages of text.
Stephen, I totally agree with an unconnected script and I took a look at some of the ones you pointed out. They're close but they look like boy's handwriting. I'm anticipating needing to make adjustments to a few words here and there to reduce the impact of repeated letters (doubled letters, character angle, baselines...).
As for getting a font made from scratch, I won't get any of the ligatures I'm hoping for. I suppose, in my dream world, I was hoping that a type designer who visits this site had one made of his/her daughters handwriting and went to the trouble of adding all the opentype features. Like I said, dream world.

<div class=commentbody>It's a bit mature but not impossibly so. I knew girls who wrote like that as a kid. They jhust put circles or hearts over their i's.
If it were a printed character, I'd go with it. It's be nice to have a slightly combined handwriting font where 'ing' and 'th' (etc.) get close to a cursive without completely crossing over.</div>
