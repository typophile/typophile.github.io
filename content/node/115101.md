  heavy and blocky header font to pair with it.\r\n\r\nI was using Georgia+Verdana
  for my drafts, before actually choosing fonts. I really like the way Verdana Pro
  Black looks for my headings (example: [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/MqUNFb1.png[/IMG]),
  and I'm looking for something which is: preferably open-source; slightly less clich\xE9d
  than Verdana; and very heavy.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear any suggestions, thanks."

  body: "In passing, it is considered a great faux pas to use lining (aka \"capital\")
    figures with small capitals. Either use full caps for OED, or old-style (aka \"lowercase\")
    figures, or small-cap height lining figures, which you'd probably have to make
    up.\r\n\r\nTo be perfectly accurate, Heuristica is the old Adobe Utopia, which
    Adobe essentially made Open Source when Slimbach redrew it. It (Heuristica) is
    a bit different from the current for-sale Utopia..."

    Utopia.\r\n\r\nBTW ideally you want a font with smallcaps that aren't so small,
    and lining numerals to match them.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Way back when a number of Berthold fonts were licensed to Adobe, the sans
    I paired with Utopia was Imago. Lately, I've wondered if the new Clear Sans from
    Intel might partner well with Utopia.
