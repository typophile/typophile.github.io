  Glyph Window?\r\n\r\nBasically, if I have glyph 'A' of Example Bold open and make
  an edit is there a command to quickly switch to Example Light in the same Glyph
  window to make the same edit and continue on through the family without closing
  the window?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: No. You could put them all into a multiple-master font, but that has it's
    own issues. Glyphs is doing a better job managing fonts that contain more than
    one master (they aren't really multiple master fonts), so if you're ready to take
    the plunge, try it out.

  body: Thanks James, I'll look into that. Trying to avoid the MM and using Superpolator.
    Would love to be able to use a command to cycle between glyphs quickly within
    a family to make quick edits or adjustments.

    it into Fontlab 6 or 7 or whatever the hell is going on over there.
