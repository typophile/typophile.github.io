body: "I'm creating some special characters to an existing font (with Fontographer
  4.7.3) and met a new problem: I have no clue on how to add a new character! So far
  i have only created characters to already existing characters slots, but with this
  font there no \"extra slots\" left. Or techically, i seem unable to activate the
  truly empty ones (double-click isnt' working). So, is there a way to create those
  **-key fonts in fontographer or should I finally move on to FontLab?\r\n\r\nAppriciate
  any help you guys can offer, right now i'm feeling very very stupid :-).\r\n\r\n[edit:
  posted originally to a wrong subforum]\r\n\r\n"

  body: You should be able to increase the number of characters allowed in the font
    at Element/Font Information (Number of characters allowed in font). You should
    then be able to double click the new ** slots to open and activate them.
