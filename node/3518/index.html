<div class=commentbody>Scangraphic out of business? Could have fooled me... <br> <br><a href=http://www.scangraphic.de/sc-about-fonts.htm target=_blank>http://www.scangraphic.de/sc-about-fonts.htm</a> <br> <br>FontHaus also sells SG fonts: <br><a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/FontFind.cfm?Function=Supplier&Search=Scangraphic" target=_blank>http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/FontFind.cfm?Function=Supplier&Search=Scangraphic</a> <br> <br>But I can't find Avant Garde in there. :-( FontHaus does, however, have Elsner & Flake's strange monospaced version. <br> <br>The Avant Garde alts were also part of Linotype's GX Font Collection, released back in the early 90s. It had such other oddities as "schoolbook letters" for Times, Helvetica, and New Century Schoolbook, all the swashes for Bookman, swash caps for Palatino (not the originals, but rather Ariadne, which has often been paired with Palatino's and others' lowercase italics) and the swash alternates for Zapf Chancery Medium Italic. <br> <br>You might be able to call Linotype and see if they have any extras left that they would be willing to sell you. You can only get to the GX features through GX apps like UniQorn and LightningDraw, or one-by-one through the InDesign glyph palette. GX features do not work automatically in InDesign like OpenType features. <br> <br>Good luck in your quest, <br>--John <br> <br>P.S. <br>RSP99 wrote: <i>Try in "The Pirate's Den" ... </div>

What if you decided to deliberately withdraw something from circulation because you were dissatisfied with it? Would you still be happy to see people trading it on newsgroup forums? <br> <br>This is not a hypothetical question. The early Tiro Typeworks Type 1 retail fonts have all been withdrawn from circulation, a process that took some effort to cancel contracts etc. We did this because some of the types were going to be revised and rereleased in OpenType format, while others we were unhappy with and wanted to retire. The fact that trading those old fonts on newsgroups doesn't financially harm me is irrelevant: the fonts are my intellectual property and I have the right to say when, how and if they are distributed.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, well if one can't have everything one wants, then Mason can't go on some pirate site and download bootleg fonts, can he ;) <br> <br>Mason, I must admit that I adamently disagree with you. Especially in this case, when it is &lt;I>clear&lt;/I> that Advant Garde's Alternates are still commercially available. <br> <br>Many designers search fonts.com and myfonts.com, and if they don't find their searched-for font (after a whole 10 minutes of research!) they assume that the font is dead, and that this legitimizes piracy. A little more research would prove that this font (AVG G Alt) is still commercially available, albeit through Scangraphic of FontShop Austrailia.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In February of this year, when I tried to buy Scangraphic Avant Garde Alts through Font Shop I had some "problems" to get it living in Europe. <br> <br>To summarize, I could not get it through FontShop Europe neither Australia. In touch with FontShop USA/Canada, they had it but told me they could not sell fonts outside of North & South America. However, they kindly directed me to Type Sales (Swipe) where I finally got it. <br> <br>By the way, a very complete and very well done font (Stephen's link about Scangraphic) with Bodytext and Headlines.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Stephen, <br> <br>any idea why FontShop.com does not display the foundry name on Font Package Detail or Font Detail pages (like the one you pointed to?) <br> <br>On the search results page: <br><a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=avant+garde" target=_blank>http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=avant+garde</a> <br>it is clearly indicated that the Avant Garde Alternates version is by Elsner+Flake, but this essential information is missing from the detail pages, which is a pity. <br> <br>Tiffany, <br>Since Avant Garde Alternates is from Elsner+Flake, naturally, it goes best with EF's version of ITC Avant Garde. <br> <br>All Elsner+Flake fonts can be purchased from: <br><a href=http://www.elsner-flake.com/ target=_blank>http://www.elsner-flake.com/</a> <br> <br>These alternates are not "new" by any means. EF has had them for quite some time. But perhaps they're new at FontShop.com. <br> <br>Best, <br>Adam</div>
