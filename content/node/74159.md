  available for freelance and contract work assigments.  \r\n\r\nShe can do manual
  TrueType instruction and PostScript hinting, font digitization, contours optimization,
  font building and rework, codepage transformations. \r\n\r\nResume and an overview
  of past projects are available at:\r\nhttp://flavours.me/fontworks\r\n\r\nDo you
  think she has a fair chance to build a small practice on this? "
