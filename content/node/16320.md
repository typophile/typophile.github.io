  ignore kerning pairs setted in font?\r\nI've tried to set some of them in my pixelfont
  but with no effect during tests in Flash\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd second question (off-topic):\r\nWhere
  can I gather some information about designing (pixel)fonts for PDA? Proper mertics,
  \"pixel\" size and so one... As far as I know pixelfonts are designed for 72 dpi
  resolution (Flash, Mac) but I think that PDA's system (Windows for pocket PC editions)
  also (like regural Windows) has 96 dpi.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.s.: Please excuse me my english,
  I don't use it too often.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful for any answers."

    for...but any information is useful :-).\r\n\r\nReturning to the kerning pairs
    issue - Yes, it was a static text field. But generally, I want to know if Flash
    respects that kind of informations at all. If Yes - I will know that I should
    make some more tests (and playing with that has any sense).\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nI'm
    using Font Creator 5 and I setted only two pairs \"WA\" and \"AW\" for test."

    supports kerning, yes. But I'm not so sure about the way you're trying to do it.\r\n\r\nWith
    auto-kerning on, Flash will reference the kerning table of the font, assuming
    that such information exists. Since the only time I ever use Windows is under
    extreme duress, I confess that I'm not at all familiar with FontCreator; the only
    thing I could suggest you do in this instance is turn auto-kerning off and enter
    numerical values for each pair you want to set, by hand, at authoring time. A
    bit tedious imho but that would work."
