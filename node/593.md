body: Hi, I am a student at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. I am working
  on my very first font &#40;don&#39;t really know what I am doing so all the help
  you can give me would be appreciated&#41;. I have included a gif of what I have
  so far... which is just upper and lower case. This font will be used as a captioning
  font on a television.. which is very low resolution. Any suggestions would be great.<img

  body: Jason, <BR>I think the basic shapes you drew are clear &amp; open, which should
    work well on screen. There are some strange things in the contrast though; The
    &#39;I&#39; is thinner than most other uprights for instance. Within letters like
    &#39;w&#39; and &#39;S&#39; some fluctuations in thickness appear. Moreover the
    horizontals are heavier than the uprights &#40;or is that on purpose?&#41;. It
    is hard to tell from this example how this will work on tv. Try looking at it
    in white on a moving and colorfull background then see what happens.  <BR>Best,
    <BR>Diederik
