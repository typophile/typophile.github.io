  to a font's vertical proportions?\r\n\r\nI know the \"[[http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/contents/letter/|anatomy]]\"
  diagram. I'm just wondering if I were to give a string of numbers, such as:\r\n\r\n1000/768/712/483/226\r\nor\r\n16/12/11/8/4\r\nor\r\n14/11/10/7/3\r\n\r\n...whether
  this would be understood to mean that if you divide the vertical space of the em
  into 1000 (or 16 or 14 or whatever) that the ascender height is 768, the cap height
  is 712, the x-height is 483, and the descender length is 226.\r\n\r\nAnd if not
  this, what other method is used to shorthand-communicate these proportions? Or,
  is that not a useful thing to communicate?"

    768 + 226 &ne; 1,000, which\u2014if you're using FontLab\u2014will result in an
    error message when you generate an OTF font."

  body: "There can be a difference between the explicit Ascender/Descender definitions
    and the length of ascenders and descenders. One is a set of vertical metrics in
    the meta data, the other is how you choose to draw the design; one is technical,
    the other is aesthetic. It\u2019s the former that FontLab cares about.\r\n\r\nAnd
    in fact, there are different Ascender/Descender metrics \u2014 there are the [OS/2]
    TypoAscender & TypoDescender, the WinAscent & WinDescent, and the [hhea] Ascender
    & Descender. There may be others I\u2019m forgetting.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t recall
    offhand all the particulars of the relationships, but I pretty sure that the WinAscent
    and WinDescent don\u2019t need to add up to the em definition.\r\n\r\nI believe
    Karsten Luecke or John Hudson (or someone like) has given a comprehensive overview
    before somewhere that you can google for."

    don\u2019t have to touch; the sum, as positive numbers, merely has to add up to
    1,000. You can ask FontLab to calculate the absolute values for you, then tweak
    them a bit to satisfy its 1,000-em compulsion. "

  body: That's what I hoped it was. Y'see, I read the ascender and descender in that
    string of numbers as actual, excluding a small strip above/below, so your off-hand
    on them as normalised had the tea going the wrong way down.
