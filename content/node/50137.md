  work, and only for about another 45 minutes.  My boss has a client that somehow
  doesn't know the font used in his own logo.  I'm not quite as keen at font identification
  as I would like, so I haven't been able to find the answer myself.  I've tried every
  online font ID site I could find, but to no avail.  So I am in desperate need of
  some help.  Like I said, I'm only at work for another 45 minutes, and the font has
  to be identified before then, so time is of the essence.  It doesn't look like you
  can post images on this board, so here is a link to an image file of the isolated
  font:\r\n\r\nhttp://i401.photobucket.com/albums/pp94/feelbettersoon/risepartlogo.jpg\r\n\r\nAny
  help you could possibly offer would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you so much in
  advance."
