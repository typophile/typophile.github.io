    you got a warning message and can't preview that means it didn't compile and the
    highlight is to indicate the error. Sometimes those warnings are tricky too interpret.
    If its kerning there may be some kind of glitch in your kerning classes or something.
    Try posting screenshots of the warning and the highlighted part of the kern feature."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Code-Grab-2_3814.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's
    a grab of a part of the kern feature with the line that is highlighted when I'm
    trying to compile. It seems like as the kerning involves glyphs, in which I added
    anchors to build their accented versions, FL adds an @ glyph before the underscore.
    Is the @ glyph necessary in the code? I guess it is?\r\n\r\nI also realized that
    all the kerning classes I had defined previously disapeared from the classes window,
    it seems that the information has been transfered in the open type kern feature
    since the @ glyph is placed before all glyphs containing anchors. The thing is
    that I don't know how this happens\r\n\r\nAs I'm not familiar with Open Type encoding,
    I don't understand what \"pos\" stands for before both kerned glyphs. I don't
    get either what \"enum pos\" stands for.\r\n\r\nHope this will help"

  body: I also realize that in a previous VFB file which is almost the same with less
    dlig edited, the kerning classes have not disappeared yet, everything works perfectly
    i.e. I'm able to compile and preview all the alternates and ligatures.

    that first.\r\nIf still problems, copy past all your code (the regular features)
    here and we can see the error.\r\nNext step is to take a look at your classes.\r\n\r\nBtw,
    the @ stands for \"class\" \u2013\_it means that it is a class that is kerned
    against 'v'."

  body: Thanks a lot to all of you. After updating the kern feature I still had some
    minor problems to fix in the code, but now, everything seems to work perfectly.
    I still don"t understand how the kerning classes disappeared but since the opentype
    kern feature has been updated succesfully, I guess it's much of a problem.
