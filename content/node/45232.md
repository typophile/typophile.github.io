body: What would be the best choice of typeface that is distinct like Consolas, but
  not monospaced and would be attractive in business presentations and spreadsheets.  The
  reason I mention Consolas because the zero has a slash to clearly show that is not
  an O.

  body: There are versions of Arial and Tahoma with slashed zeros. Search for "slashed
    zero Arial" or "Tahoma slashed." T93Y and Monaco are other possibilities, and
    Technical Slashed would provide that hand-lettered blueprint look.

  body: "Thanks for pointing me in the direction of slashed zero fonts but I was I
    was hoping to get away from programmer and windows based fonts.\r\n\r\nI was looking
    for something that was <strong>attractive and elegant</strong> while at the same
    time had the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n1.  Crisp clear characters.\r\n2.
    \ Extended characterset.\r\n3.  'l', '1' and 'i' are easily distinguished\r\n4.
    \ '0', 'o' and 'O' are easily distinguished\r\n\r\nforward quotes from back quotes
    are easily distinguished -prefer mirrored appearance\r\nClear punctuation characters,
    especially braces, parenthesis and brackets.\r\n\r\nAnd whether on screen or printed
    looks fabulous and is a san serif.\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nI

  body: Could you explain what you mean by getting away from "windows based fonts"?
    For instance, do you mean fonts that aren't bundled with Microsoft products, like
    XP, Vista, and Office, this being based on a perception that MS core fonts are
    overexposed, overused, and not distinctive enough?

    solutions."
