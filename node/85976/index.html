  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Conventional font categories are practically useless to me. Almost every font I make falls under decorative, sans-serif or both. That&rsquo;s not much of a category range. Pretty much anything before Morrison I throw into the Ancient category. I don&rsquo;t have any need to subdivide that category. For my purposes, those fonts have a common thread: not particularly interested. Most if not all font categories deal with pre-Morrison archetypes.</p>
<p>Old sans (Franklin Gothic and other sans with ancient flav)
Geo-classical (Futura, Gill, Bernhard Gothic)
Helveticas (Arial, and hundreds of other mid-century neutrals)
Frutigers (Museo Sans, Verdana)
Humanist sans (Easy. If the baseline is straight, it ain&rsquo;t humanist. Most of what I see categorized as humanist are just Franklins.)
Geo-gothic (Avant Garde)
Square Sans (EF Digital, Bank Gothic, Chimes)
Superelliptical (Microgramma, Eurostile)
Brush Sans (Flash, Balloon)
Techincal (DIN, Highway Gothic, stencils, elevator buttons, template lettering, labels &amp; other &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; lettering)
Pixel (early computing retro, including segmented LED)
MICR (Data 70)
Rounded Sans (V.A.G., Arial Rounded)
Compacta (Impact, Helv Inserat)
Industrial slabs (Memphis, Museo)
Stops (Stop and similar minimalist variants produced in the 70&rsquo;s &amp; 80&rsquo;s. I didn&rsquo;t think it was a category until I moved to Japan. Bored font historians looking for a subject should try tracking Stop&rsquo;s influence on car emblems, videogames, graffiti and the circa 1990 4k demo scene.)
Geo slabs (Lubalin Graph)
Structured scripts (Magneto, Deftone Stylus)
Scripts (boo)
Decorative (Actually decorative. Fonts that look like fire or chrome etc. It&rsquo;s often used as a catch-all category by the ancient ones)
Misc (a better name for a catch-all category)</p>
<p>These are the categories I use in my work. Unfortunately, other people don&rsquo;t see these as categories. A famous font grump called my Pirulen font a Bank Gothic knock-off or something but he probably wouldn&rsquo;t call every transitional font a Times knock-off. Categories are important. Exploring a category sounds better than knocking off.</p>
<p>In the future, people and machines will make more Geoslabs. They will all resemble Avant Garde Gothic a bit. Geometry, baby. People will make Compactas that look somewhat like Compacta. They&rsquo;ll make hundreds more MICR and Stop inspired fonts and there will always be those who will place them in the Decorative category and call them knock-offs while they toil away on the next great, slightly-different Garamond.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Typodermic, first: I agree with you, established font category schemes are AGES behind.
Example: Myfonts.</p>
<p>To simply tag the fonts is not the solution.</p>
<p>I guess, nothing will happen until a case can be made for better categorization increases finding and sales.</p>
<p>A sensible categorization for the future would have to be, in my opinion, two- or three-dimensional. That means, one can combine a feature 1-“Venetian” with a feature 2-“florated” or 3-“shaddowed” and so on. Perhaps it would only work (for searching = finding = sales) when fonts get tagged systematically and not arbitrarily. <em>Inside</em> the font info data, possibly.</p>
<p>If one looks for, e.g.: “a blackletter connected script Greek” – you’re lost.</p>
<p>Has anybody an overview about what has been done in this respect during the last ten years?</p>
<p>How big is the interest of font producers to work out and agree upon a new categorization scheme?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t know if categorization is important to everyone else. What I&rsquo;ve always found frustrating is since they stopped making new font categories the 20th century happened and hundreds of new categories blossomed. I don&rsquo;t know what makes a font category. Some fonts are so special, that nothing comes close to them. It doesn&rsquo;t happen much these days but in the 20th century new font categories happened a lot.</p>
<p>If I treat a font as a category it means nothing to anyone else. As far as most people are concerned it&rsquo;s a tribute, knock-off, &ldquo;inspired by&rdquo; or whatever you want to call it. You think I&rsquo;m making a tribute to Stop, in my ad copy I tip my hat to it. But in my mind, I&rsquo;m just making a Stop. In my mind Stop is a category like a clarendon. When I think about Stops, I not only consider the original Stop but all the other Stops I&rsquo;ve seen in my life. The way graffiti artists interpreted it. The way it was incorporated into the square sans (Roland). Amiga intros: lots of Stop influenced fonts there. And, as I mentioned, in Japan, Stop wormed its way into the visual culture and it fed back into western techno culture.</p>
<p>Nick: damn, I just lost 10 font geek point because I have no idea. But I ended up finding this which is fascinating.</p>

<p>As a type designer, sticking to established categories is actually a quite difficult way to make a living. If a category is established, then there probably already exists a face that exemplifies that category and will be the default choice for designers looking for something in that category.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Too often, I see classifications that seem odd or even wrong to me.  It seems as though classifications have noting to do with what the designer had in mind and more to do with whatever the person doing the categorization seems to feel is important.  I think I will just make stuff and not bother giving it a category.  If someone else later puts it in a category, I am fine with that as long as I don&rsquo;t have to be involved in the nit picking arguments that come with such a chore.</p>
<p>In his day and age, their is technology that can figure out much of the &ldquo;what is this thing&rdquo; problems.  My only problem is assigning search terms or meta-data that will help a person find my type if it fits their needs.  I can&rsquo;t be sure I have covered the correct bases to make a reasonably intelligent search. When I have gone to a vendor like MyFonts and typed in search criteria, I am often amazed at what shows up!  I look at faces out there which I think are capable of doing the same kind of job as faces I am working on and see what search terms they have used.  It is not unusual for me to see terms that don&rsquo;t seem to fit my intention.  That is not to say that &ldquo;My Way&rdquo; is the right way, it just indicates how hard it is to get enough of the search terms that any given font buyer would use to find what they want.  I hate the guys who put every search term on earth in all their type just to be included in everyones searches, no matter what.</p>

<p>Indeed. Most type classification efforts, PANOSE included, define fonts in terms of morphological and historical characteristics that make sense to hardcore typographers, but don&rsquo;t have much utility to someone who wants to know &ldquo;what&rsquo;s a good font for this project?&rdquo; or &ldquo;what font would go with this one I already have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, putting fonts in  a &ldquo;humanist sans&rdquo; category is great if you already know what a humanist sans is and what it&rsquo;s good for. If you don&rsquo;t, then the category might as well be &ldquo;florble-glorks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some companies have expressed that they don&rsquo;t wish their trademarked name to lower-case. That&rsquo;s why, when I photoshop, regardless of what app I&rsquo;m photoshopping with, I always begin wth a lowercase p.</p>
<p>Some of the PLINC categories, are styles. Stencils, shadows, bas relief, blocks. The PLINC catalog I have was printed in 1971. I guess humanist sans fonts hadn&rsquo;t been invented yet because there&rsquo;s no category for it &lt;-interrobang goes here</p>

<p>The question is whether using &ldquo;categories&rdquo; helps designers find the fonts they&rsquo;d like to use for a particular project or not.
It&rsquo;s a means, not an end. And as a means, it isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>This is the available research saying this, not me. Although my own personal experience jibes with it.</p>

<p>And then try talking to a few web designers. Marketing is a simple thing. (But few do it. I guess because it&rsquo;s work. And it almost always leads to more work. It&rsquo;s much easier to lean back on the couch of opinions and assumptions that &ldquo;everybody knows&rdquo; are true but never are.)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see anything in that summary about categories not working for users. It only says vaguely that users want &ldquo;excellent organization of the fonts&rdquo; (and later, that subjective-seeming tags are a concern). Was there more (about categories) in the talk that didn&rsquo;t make it into the summary?</p>

It may be that this was an original definition of it for one classification scheme or the other, but I can&rsquo;t think of anyone that ever defined it to me like that. For a modern classification, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to make much sense to exclude for example Frutigers from that category; for most people I know, they&rsquo;re actually one of the leading examples for humanist sans serifs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It certainly is true that traditional typeface categories tend to neglect even the recognized subdivisions of sans-serif types (Grotesques, Geometric sans-serif, Humanist sans-serif), never mind attempting to subdivide the endless chaos of display faces.</p>
<p>Instead, they&rsquo;re mostly occupied with Roman faces, and even there, the classification is focused on the serif style. So we might get&hellip;</p>
<p>Sans-serif
Egyptian slab-serif
Clarendon
Latin (wedge serif)
Modern
Transitional
Oldstyle</p>
<p>as a list of classifications.</p>
<p>Some additional categories&hellip;</p>
<p>Weighted sans (i.e. Radiant, Globe Gothic)
Flare serif (i.e. Optima)</p>
<p>Grotesque (early sans-serifs)
Gothic (News Gothic, Franklin Gothic)
Geometric sans
Humanist sans</p>
<p>are obvious enough, but to really subdivide today&rsquo;s sans-serif faces might be considered by some to be akin to creating a division similar to that between oldstyle and modern for last week&rsquo;s fashions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m with you on the Pre/Post Morrison era definition. When Jim tweaked Cooper Black and put it on the cover of LA Woman - that was a watershed moment. What followed was the whole Tootsie-Roll-Brady-Bunch-Hour typography steamroller that defined a decade. Nice call.</div>
