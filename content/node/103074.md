  have been investigating the PDF from rackspace and both the font and the acutal
  diagram seems to be a vectorized image in the PDF. I have no clue which font is
  used. I made a screenshot of the font. The URL for the rackspace brochure is\r\n\r\nhttp://c1776742.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/downloads/pdfs/RackspaceCriticalApplicationServicesAdobeCQ.pdf\r\n\r\nI
  have aldready tried to upload different screenshots of the font to font identification
  web services but to no avail.\r\n\r\nCan you help me identify the font?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

      of the looks from using the font \"Gotham Rounded\" using capital letters. Perhaps
      the drawings are using a softened version of mentioned font?\r\n\r\nThanks for
      providing the URL to WTF. I am now looking for a font similar to the handwritten
      font in red color. That looks nice too! \r\n\r\nAny input on either font or
      font substitution are welcomed!"
