  body: "Nick, I'm going to respectfully disagree with you on that.  It's the swash
    S anyway, so in the very rare situation where the context isn't enough to differentiate,
    there are three other S glyphs to choose from.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sassy

  body: 'I love the font, but I have to agree with Nick: only the first of the four
    S glyphs looks like an S (not an L) and even the first one is confusing. It could
    be a T.'

    L\r\n4. L\r\n\r\nSc makes it easier to read then Sa thats for shore.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you could tweak the angle a bit? (or is that a noob suggestion?)\r\n\r\nBut I
    really like your font. And baseball scripts are trending. Yours wil definitely
    sell! :-)"

    Lassy. '

    from that works great!\r\n\r\nAgain lovely font!"

  body: The alternate S is still confusing to my point of view. I think the confusion
    come from the spin which should be less right. Also, did you try a smaller top
    loop? Your basic S is more readable even though it may be less right. Good work
    overall.

  body: "Hi.  I didn't try a smaller loop on top, because it never occurred to me
    that the S was ambiguous.  I thought I, T, J, L and Z would be more likely candidates
    for problem readings, but I think context solves most problems (as it does in
    most scrip fonts, where if you look at certain uppercase characters individually
    you go \"what's that then?\")\r\nI'm considering making a Pro version, with way
    more swashes and alternates, all selectable by the user rather than automatic
    contextual substitutions.  I'de probably also add alternates for all caps settings
    for acronyms.  As of now, it's selling much better than I expected, so I wouldn't
    want to quickly release an advanced version, for fear it would appear as something
    of a cash in.  I'm going to wait and see how it gets used, and if I feel a Pro
    version would be a useful addition, I'll make one.  I guess the decider will be
    when I see someone's modified it themselves to solve a certain problem and I think
    it looks bad!  I am forced to use Monotype Corsiva quite regularly in the day
    job, and the amount of times I'm asked to change the ampersand for something that
    'looks less like a J' is pretty ridiculous.  I'm all for users using fonts as
    they see fit, but if a line is crossed I'll find it hard to not march right in
    and tell them they're doing it wrong!"
