  body: "I believe this edition was published in 77 as a facsimilie of the original
    1930's print. I saw an original edition at the recent ansel adams exhibit at the
    MFA here in Boston and fell in love with the font (espcially in lowercase bodies
    of text)\r\nIt was a pain to find an image of it online."
