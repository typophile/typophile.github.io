My feeling is the move occured during the transition from custom, often monospaced bitmap fonts (often but not always drawn by non-typedesigners) to outline fonts.

The usual solution -making it a &quot;perfect&quot; circle- is just pukey to me. So reversing the stroke contrast (which makes sense in the context of the numerals in general), or giving it weight only on one side, and/or using hybrid nums (taller than x-height) is better, I think. <BR> <BR>&gt; Georgia? <BR> <BR>But the <i>original</i> Georgia nums (hybrids), not the later -tamed- ones. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good question about the &quot;slash-0&quot;. <BR> <BR>I work at a library and trained myself to start slashing zeros for better legibility with call numbers. Though the dotted 0 does sound nicer. <BR> <BR>The l/1 is still an issue though. And funny  that it was mentioned, as I've just gotten back from a trip to Paris (Paris!), where I noticed the numeral 1 is almost always written as if it were an UC &quot;A&quot; minus the crossbar (and perhaps with a slightly shortened left leg). It took me a minute to decipher it, but it does seem to make a lot of legibility sense. <BR> <BR>Actually, I was considering a post about just that. How common is the A-without-a-crossbar numeral one, and are there any fonts that use it? <BR> <BR>David Roughs <BR></div>

be confused for the O-slash (like in Danish). I actually
like the reverse-slash one best.</p>

And because the slash isn’t confined to the counter, they all resemble Øs, rendering them useless.
By the way, I’m a proponent of the backslashed 0, like the one in the original Anonymous.</div>

<p>Yes, Consolas offers dotted 0 and clean 0 as alternative versions of the slashed 0. It also has old-style figures.
Sadly, Visual Studio, the software which most likely being used together with Consolas, doesn&rsquo;t support these Opentype features.</p>
