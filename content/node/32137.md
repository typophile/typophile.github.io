body: "please help!\r\n\r\nI'm a graphic design student and have just started my final
  year. In this year we have to do a major project which runs in two parts over the
  year, first part (where i am now) is research based and the second is the studio
  practice and actually designing something that has come out of this research.\r\n\r\nMy
  topic from the end of last year was expressive type and legibility, with questions
  like does type need to be read to communicate ideas etc. From this i was told i
  need to ask harder questions and \"go much deeper and in more fresh, even idiosyncratic
  directions with your research.\"\r\n\r\ni am interested in the development of type
  like how it started purely as a function - a way to communicate but is now an important
  means of communication and can show visual evidence of thought and emotion.\r\n\r\nBut
  i need something else to apply type to or some sort of social issue etc....which
  is what im really stuck with so please help if you have any ideas or thoughts, it
  would really be appreciated!\r\n\r\nsome examples from other students :\r\nballroom
  dancing - showing the movement and dance through type\r\nand someone last year redid
  a book of personal letters (cant remember the book title or by who) in a typographic
  way.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nMel\r\n"

    typographers of the Russian constructivist movement helped establish the second-most
    murderous and second-most repressive slave state in human history, condemning
    tens of millions of people to death. Take a look at the work of Lizzitsky and
    Rochenko and you can just churn out volumes about how typography can be used for
    evil in the guise of liberal social causes."

    their names before you diss them; that's El Lizzitsky and Aleksandr Rodchenko
    to you. I'm really looking forward to seeing a post from you that <em>doesn't</em>
    announce your politics first and your ignorance second).\r\n\r\nMel \u2013 as
    for your project, well, look around you; I remember a big fuss (national newspaper
    headlines) from a few years ago about the graphic work done for Te Papa by Saatchis
    Wellington. Even the fairly recent 'concrete poetry' project along the waterfont
    there is not free of contention. Wellington does an international arts festival
    no? What do you think are the key criteria in selecting the typefaces for the
    festival collateral? How does this translate from the local government brief to
    what the agency actually ends up using? And how? Much of the time it's not the
    type itself that is emotive, so much as the way it has been used...\r\n\r\nResearch;
    I notice that the 'local' ProDesign magazine had become a lot more type-friendly
    in recent issues (they now have Kris Sowersby writing a regular column) so why
    not go through the back issues? "

    body: cool thanks for that Ben, yeah i remember the concrete poetry along the
      waterfront, so will look into that more - have heaps of pics, and true that
      it's the way type has been used thats emotive, which is what im more interested
      in rather than the typefaces themselves, (sorry was hard to get out what i was
      thinking properly in the first post) and sweet i actually have a subscription
      to ProDesign so will go through all them this arvo...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WWW-6138-E13A_4288.jpg]
