		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the offer! What format would you send it though? I&#39;m [generally] on Windows. <BR> <BR>Anyway, what I&#39;m mostly wondering is this: Since this is a large design, but with good weight and spacing, how does it function as a <i>text</i> font for hi-res displays? I&#39;m hoping John Hudson will chime in. <BR> <BR>And the main reason I&#39;m curious is that I&#39;ve been working on a similar font since &#39;98, but mine uses grayscaling, so it requires special treatmen/usage. It will be released soon. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

Essentially because Windows use 96ppi to figure out how to draw stuff, things come out looking smaller than on a Mac. How to get past this problem in producing a font like this is beyomd me. Hrant may have some good insight into the size difference and how to compensate / allow for it in your production. <BR> <BR>I like this face - it&#39;s quite nice, and I think that Hrant may be right: useful for text at high resolutions. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bonsoir Christophe ettoutlemonde, <BR> <BR>TRUTH in Design will sort out how to use grayscale bitmap fonts all over MacOS. Until then, as reported, they work great in Flash and Photoshop. <BR> <BR>The trouble is, there is no cross-platform bitmap font standard except TrueType and OpenType pixel fonts. Even MacOS which gave us brilliant post-PARC typography &#40;<a href="http://www.kare.com/MakePortfolioPage.cgi?page=4" target="_blank">http://www.kare.com/MakePortfolioPage.cgi?page=4</a>&#41; has now abandoned its bitmap font heritage. shame. Upside is, if they support pixel sizes, they have to support pixel fonts. Details to be posted to this board. As far as bitmap&#60;-&#62;outline correlation, it may have to be handled by the designer, not insensitive operating systems and apps. <BR> <BR>TiD wants to publish MR. PIXEL. Qu&#39;en pensezvous M.
