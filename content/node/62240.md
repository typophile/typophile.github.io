  I would like to know which is preferred for printing? I've had a few people tell
  me that true type fonts are not suitable for print design (though I'm not exactly
  sure why). I can't find a definitive source saying this is true. Which I am ok with
  b/c I use mainly Opentype PS. I have a few Opentype TT, though, and my question
  is are these suitable for printing? And if not could someone care to explain why?\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\n\r\nLogan"

  body: "The \"TrueType not suitable for printing\" idea is from pre-Opentype days,
    and was mostly a myth spread by printers who didn't want to support it. Generally
    it was because they were dealing in formats that lacked font embedding. The \"problem\"
    was that if a customer sent a document that specified a TT font of a commonly-used
    typeface, but didn't include the font, the printer would substitute the version
    from their own Type 1 font library, which could have slightly different metrics
    and make the flow come out differently.\r\n\r\nNowadays you can send a PDF and
    it won't matter what you used in it."
