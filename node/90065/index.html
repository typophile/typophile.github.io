  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">For starters, I am not a graphic designer or artist. I've come to this forum to get assistance from those of you who enjoy doing this type of thing. I'm getting a tattoo this weekend, but need someone to draw it up for me. I tried using GIMP2.6 (which my friend suggested), but could not, for the life of me, figure out how to accomplish what I wanted. It may as well have been in Hebrew. I also tried installing "Illustrator" and "Photoshop" (to no avail). I'm just not talented at all when it comes to this type of thing. I'm looking to get a tattoo of a triquetra using this verse (And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. I Cor 13:13). The verse itself will be in the form of the triquetra. I don't know how to twist/turn/shape text into a desired shape. If any of you could help me with this, I'd GREATLY appreciate it. I'd like the font to be Lucinda Handwriting. And the image itself can be no smaller than 3"x3" and no larger than 4"x4" (though I'm sure the size can probably be scaled up or down when printing---so I've been told). Thank you in advance for all who decide to help me out. By the way, I don't need the circle in the triquetra (just the triquetra itself). Feel free to email me your design at dreinva@yahoo.com

And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. I Cor 13:13
And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. I Corinthians 13:13
(whichever length works best)
Lucinda Handwriting (if it's no more work to switch fonts, I'd also like to see it in Minya Nouvelle)

Unfortunately, the guy who's doing my tattoo is fairly new and only hand draws his tats. This tat has to be done with a program for it to come out right (as the letters have to be SPOT ON). That is the reason I'm asking for assistance from you guys.</div>

I tried and tried to figure it out using that GIMP2.6 program and also Microsoft Word. I just CAN NOT figure out how to shape text.</div>

I might look at uncial fonts, especially ones

That said, go talk to a couple of artists and ask them about size, the amount of text, the design and placement.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with hrant and jselig…put some money down if you want someone from here to design it for you. Do you ask your tattoo artist to just throw down a tattoo for you without purchasing it? We eat, too. :)

I also suggest you go to an artist who knows what they are doing with letterforms. Do you really want a shitty tattoo for the rest of your life? If he is doing it in his garage or kitchen … well that's even worst. Best of luck dude!</div>

dreinva, as you can see from my image above you have some interesting design challenges ahead of you. 

The above comments are very critical, compare my sarcastic image (using comic sans) with hrant's linkage and keep in mind the above comments. Each letter shape is an expression in and of itself and if everything goes according to plan, all those letter shape expressions should be a integral kick ass component of the entire design. 

I think this piece could be really awesome but it will take some time in the planning stages.

Good luck, hope that helps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You might consider adding a background behind the type. Create a triquetra that looks like a 3d object, similar to the one below, and put the type on it, sort of like it was engraved on a bracelet. Space the words so that the hidden areas are between two words, so that no characters are hidden.

In the example below the bands are obviously way too thin, there's not room for the type, but take that general shape and make the bands much wider so the type will fit in them.

		<div class="commentbody">For all of those who gave insightful, helpful responses, thank you for your time and help. I eventually posted my request in an "Illustrator" forum. From there, I rec'd a video on how to go about doing what I was attempting Instead of trying something simple my first time using Illustrator, I had to go tackle something pretty complicated. It took me a little while, playing with the font (different fonts and sizes) to finally get what I was looking for. My first two fonts, the tattoo artist said wouldn't work, because of eventual "bleeding" together. This week though, I found 2 fonts that were the right size and spacing that would work. Hoping to get my tat this weekend. Thanks again for all that helped me. Will post a pic once I get it done.</div>

Looking forward the pic.

Last week I got a killer tattoo comish. It's a ribbon of text telling the guy's life story. The text begins on top of his left foot and wraps and weaves and moves up and around his whole body pausing / incorporating for his many other tattoos (one of which is mine!) He's a hip hop artist and will be coming up with the verses, I'm so stoked to get this piece going.

What I really fond intriguing about your piece is not so much the design challenges - they can be the fun part - but the fact that you've laid christian verse on what was/is originally a pagan symbol ... </div>
