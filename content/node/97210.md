  and cant find any definitive answer, maybe there isnt one... Or maybe someone here
  can shed some light/wisdom.\r\n\r\nI, as the studio manager endeavour to keep our
  licensing completely legal and avoid any infringements. We are a production department
  within an agency, and generally we do all our work in-house. Our licences cover
  this in excess (approximately 30 machines) but I always purchase 40-50 to cover
  growth etc.\r\n\r\nRecently due to increased workload we have come into the situation
  where we have had to commission external parties (freelance suppliers) to build
  our designs (albeit webpages and micro sites) based off our photoshop designs supplied
  to them. The fonts in these designs are completely static, however we need to supply
  them the fonts to create/build the work. These freelance suppliers generally work
  from home or their studio. Is such work covered under the majority of EULA?\r\n\r\nMy
  concern is, if it is not, and they need to acquire their own licences, it could
  potentially blow out budgets significantly, where a $200 piece of work could potentially
  end up in the thousands after purchasing additional licences for their site/location.\r\n\r\nOr
  would this be covered similarly to a print bureau, where fonts are supplied to output/print
  the work then deleted after the completion of the job.\r\n\r\nAlternatively can
  you suggest any other ways around this?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    pretty much.  :-/\r\n\r\nMany font houses don't even allow the print bureau borrow-then-delete
    scenario you mention. You can probably understand why (that last \"delete\" bit
    won't actually happen). Heck, some of them don't even allow PDF embedding! I myself
    believe this last one is too much.\r\n\r\nWork-around? Here's the only one I can
    think of, although it's a massive gray area: transfer ownership of the font to
    the contractor; once they're done they transfer it back. Which means you're supposed
    to delete the fonts until they transfer them back to you (and they're supposed
    to delete them at the end). Of course even if this process is legal the results
    are likely to be unethical.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      just have to rasterize everything that leaves the place now so fonts don't need

    - Remote access to our FontAgent server, would be a great option, I do have enough
    licences (software and font) to cover them, the only concern is that the fontagent
    server still downloads the database locally, so in turn fonts are now at a different
    location, hence break EULA. Am I right?\r\n\r\nI think the easiest less painful
    way might be for us to \"convert to smart object\" text layers before we send
    it to the devs to build/cut-up. Then technically as long as they don't edit those
    smart objects, they wont need the typeface.  "

    can't stand Tuesdays btw) what is the big difference? I mean if I come over to
    your work station and use your computer - or I access your computer remotely?
    \r\n\r\nShouldn't the EULA be concerned to where and whom the license resides?
    \r\n\r\nSeriously, if 20 people come over to your work station and use your computer
    shouldn't that in itself violate the EULA? Having access to your computer -remotely
    or not - isn't the object of a licence agreement. The object of the license agreement
    should be concerned with - where - the font resides*. \r\n\r\nOr else why allow
    20 people to come over and use your computer?? I'm confused...\r\n\r\n\r\n*And
    to that I think fonts should be able to track IP residency. \r\n\r\nn."

  body: "Neil, in the case of most foundries, licensing is based on a requirement
    for each computer or device hosting the fonts to have a license. Additionally,
    licenses are usually (though not always) arranged on the basis of a specific user
    or company, regardless of whether the license is for a single user or 10,000.
    Sometimes that restriction is geographical as well. A freelancer, third party
    or other entity not named on the license would therefore require their own license
    if the font(s) are going to be resident on their computer or device.\r\n\r\nIn
    the case above I was specifically responding to Justin's question about distribution
    through a remote server tool or third party access to a font management database.
    This scenario implies that the remote user is accessing the font(s) on their computer,
    which is not part of the licensed entity. What you are describing is a scenario
    in which a user is remotely accessing and using fonts on a licensed computer,
    which means (to my mind, in this context) that the fonts remain resident on the
    licensed computer and are not moved to the third party computer.\r\n\r\nTo your
    other point: if you have a scenario in which a computer has a licensed copy of
    the font software on it, why should it matter who uses that computer? As long
    as they are not modifying the font software, duplicating it for re-distribution,
    producing work or embedding the font file in ways expressly prohibited by the
    EULA or for an individual, group or entity other than that licensed to use the
    font(s), it does not matter who uses the computer."

  body: "Thanks Karl, as a freelance graphic designer I'm glad I just buy fonts as
    my clients need them. EULA ins and outs are something I might have to consider
    if and when I ever finish up the half dozen or so modern display faces I've been
    toying with over the years.\r\n\r\nRemote access to a someones work station seems
    doable then as long as the font remains on that work station's computer. I'm not
    up on cloud services but I imagine there is a all-in-one studio for paying users.
    Adobe software coupled with Myfonts inventory ...that sort of service could be
    quite marketable.\r\n\r\nn.\r\n\r\n"
