  a while.  This forum seems fantastic.  The range of knowlege really surprised me.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just getting into typography.  I design as a hobby, so I don&#39;t
  have a large collection of fonts.  I&#39;m designing with free fonts and prepackaged
  stuff, which is sad, considering how many beautiful faces I&#39;ve seen on this
  forum alone. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I could use a critique for this logo: <BR> <BR><img
  src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20446.gif" alt="Subliminal Logo">
  <BR> <BR>It is set in a free font called Forgotten Futurist.  Really, I&#39;ve only
  designed by sight until now, but I&#39;d like to learn how to do it right.  Any
  critiques would help, and I have an extremely thick skin.'

    between forms. <BR> <BR>there are some ligature possibilities that might <BR>heighten
    the ambiguity... <BR> <BR>Because of your name, it&#39;d be a good opportunity
    for <BR>more of a Sony/Aiwa approach, imo... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure about the

  body: I could be shooting in the dark here, but when I saw the icon beside the &#34;subliminal&#34;
    title, I assumed that the single strand curving behind the other three stands
    &#40;foreground because the single stand is breaking behind them&#41; represented
    a subliminal, background, or underlying message. <BR> <BR>If you were to lose
    the icon, which looks very corporate, you might try something like drawing a horizonatal
    negative space line right through vertical center of the word subliminal

  body: i think the letters are very good. i tried tighter letterspacing, which may
    or may not be better...  <BR> <BR>and i&#39;d not do an icon with it.  it doesn&#39;t
    need it, and it&#39;s gratuitous.  i was turned off by the icon because i couldn&#39;t
    associate it with anything i know about.   i would concentrate on the letters.  <BR>

  body: 'I think a logo for a firm called subliminal SHOULD be subliminal. Make it
    almost unreadable or hidden in something else. The way it is right now, it really
    says nothing.. which would be okay, imo, just a typeface for a comapny is WAY
    okay in my book, but then you&#39;d have to have a simpler, blander font and do
    away with any playfulness.  <BR> <BR>What I&#39;d do, I&#39;d make it very very
    simple, the kind of invisible simple typography and print it white on white. Or

    is: Set your type or graphic and use a layer style like drop shadow and then take
    the layer fill down to 0% it preserves the layer effect but elimnates the fill.
    Good for a glass like effect.'

    coolest free fonts &#40;that actually came through the Typophile Critique&#41;
    is <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1269.html">MRH Anton</a>.
    It has obliques and unicase alternates. Very solid as free fonts go. It fits this
    squarish, sans serif look, but has much more interesting things going on. <BR>
