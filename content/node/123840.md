    for metal type in Jaspert's Type Encyclopaedia (1970)\r\nThere are many digital
    versions of Bernhard Fashion, some under this name and some under others including
    Bernardo Moda by Peter Wiegel (2014) http://www.dafont.com/bernardo-moda.font.
    \ Some versions include extensions and changes  such as Black Tie by Anton Scholtz
    http://www.identifont.com/show?JYV and Nick Curtis's Quoi Chou NF (2006) http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Quoi+Chou+NF&q=Go\r\nBTW,
