  body: "I was going to say that this was hand-done because the top \"FRESH\" and
    the bottom \"FRESH\" don't look the same, but since the 'S' in \"STAY\" and the
    first \"FRESH\" seem to be the same, I would guess that the lower-case characters
    contain alternates for the upper case.\r\n\r\nI don't know what it is though.
    It looks free, maybe try dafont.\r\n\r\n -  Lex"
