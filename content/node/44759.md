  body: Unfortunately bosoms and eyeballs may be the initial association. Have you
    tried making the circle of the "b" and the two o's progressively larger? I see
    the explosion you're going for, but it took me a couple times to get it.

    slowly increasing the size of each letter.\r\n\r\nFor example:  b @ 25%, o @ 50%,
    o @ 75%, m @ 100%\r\n\r\nJust an idea to play with..."

    that anything is \"booming\" in this logo.  It's fairly static.  You need some

    until they were pointed out (hee hee!). But yep, I see them now. I was trying
    to get the impression of amplification across and thought the circles looked a
    bit like speakers.\r\n\r\nI agree that it's quite static looking, I think I'll
    go back to the drawing board and see what I can come up with.\r\n\r\nWill post
    the results,\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "For such an explosive word (pun intended) I'd personally like to see the
    work less rigid and locked down. While your version is clean and well constructed,
    it doesn't convey any energy, fun or excitement that could come with a moniker
    like Boom.\r\n\r\nI might be repeating what a lot of others have said, but this
    is one of those projects that people love to get. It allows them to explore the
    less confining guidelines in logo design. Get creative and throw some passion
    into this less than stellar first attempt. "

  body: cute but its not pushed 100% all the way right. Simplify the elements a bit
    more. Cut out more of the waste colors. Try to cut it down to 1 color if you can.

    range of companies including theatre, medical, beauty and business. They would
    like the logo to show amplification.\r\n\r\nHere are some changes to the first
    attempt and some very rough other ideas.\r\n\r\nI know the speech bubble is used
    a lot but I think it gets the idea of amplification across and I like the circular
    look.\r\n\r\nI guess the lower left looks too like the more4 logo.\r\n\r\nAppreciate
    any thoughts.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/option3_6413.jpg]"

    it more like the ''b'' to show a progression of sound. '

  body: "#1, #2 and #3 are the only ones that I find fresh and exciting. But you're
    having problems with letters. M is problematic on all of them. Ditch #3. Dead
    end. Ideally the logo is between #1 and #2 with changed m.\r\n\r\nIt will probably
    be the easiest to make m bigger in 1, which will emphasize every letter (otherwise
    it's also reading boo m - are you scared?)\r\n\r\nCOmpletely forget about 6 because
    it looks like clip-art logo."

    though the sound is passing through each letter and is just about to move into
    the 'm'. \r\n\r\nI don't actually mind #4, though it is a bit more static. #5
    reminds me of the more 4 logo.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/more4_144x134_5668.gif]\r\n\r\nYou're
    definitely on the right track with #1 though. Stick at it."

    a word, because i always hits a breaking spot where it just looks hokey.\r\n\r\nIt's
    like that Coca Cola product 'Zero'.  Yeah, it has a very very very nasty type
    treatment hat I think originally was supposed to indicate weight loss, but I won't
    touch the stuff because it's such an abonimation of type.\r\n\r\nI really strongly
    second 'all about seb's suggestion, having a fun vector comic-book boom would
    be wonderful.\r\n\r\nYou could also look at colouring treatments like comic book
    titles, big letters with half-tine gradients in them (which still hold up in B&W)\r\n\r\nmy
    first thought when I saw your rounded sansserif was intense sadness.  It looks
    like it's trying to be too clich\xE9, or too trendy, but I'm not certain of the
    freshness or longevity of a trend like that.  Best of luck!"
