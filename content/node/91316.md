  \"the sea\" album cover.  I'm specifically trying to figure out the font used for
  her name \"CORINNE BAILEY RAE\". I've attached a copy of the album cover. Here is
  a [[http://www.corinnebaileyrae.net/#home.php| link to her site]] where the font
  is used again on the words...\r\n\r\nCORINNE BAILEY RAE\r\nHOME\r\nNEWS\r\nBLOG\r\nDISCOGRAPHY\r\nLIVE\r\nSCRAPBOOK\r\nVIDEO\r\nFORUMS\r\nPHOTOS\r\nSIGN

  body: "Avant Garde. It exists with many variations and alternate characters, by
    a plethora of commercial vendors and, individual designers. The free version by
    Mewtor (1997, widely available) contains many, if not all, of the glyphs shown
    in the album cover., but it's quite a bit darker than what's used on the website,
    which is a thin or light version.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
