  body: "I agree with Ryuk, it is actually Joey Nelson who cannibalized ITC Kabel
    and created <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-1&ffam=Decade%20-%20Regular&fid=eb3d5d8bca613e7544602122717d457a&fsize=60&text=BAD%20BOYS%20BLUE&wrap=2|Decade]]</strong>
    free font.\r\nI suggest to use the original legitimate font if possible: ITC Kabel"
