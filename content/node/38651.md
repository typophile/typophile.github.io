  have been told he often creates his own fonts from old letter forms, but was wondering
  if there is a font i could use as a starting point. have tried identifont and myfonts
  with no luck.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WASTED_4663.jpg]"

  body: Oh, now I see. Seven minutes. I thought you identified independently from
