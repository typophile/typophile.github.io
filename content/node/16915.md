  Any ideas?

  body: This looks like the American Highway typeface. Its most popular digitisation
    is The [[Font Bureau]]'s ubiquitous <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FB.106460.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=REAL+SIMPLE&sampleSize=32"

  body: "Close indeed. If I may quote myself from a three year old thread:\r\n\r\n<em>PMN
    Caecilia by Peter Matthias Noordzij (released by Adobe in 1991) predates Luc(as)
    de Groot's Thesis by some 3 years (originally released under the FontFont banner
    in 1994), but the production of Thesis started in 1989, so it's quite possible
    they were developped almost simultaneously.\r\n\r\nPeter Matthias produced the
    \ preliminary sketches for his PMN Caecilia typeface during his third year of
    study in 1983. Perhaps Luc(as) was looking over his shoulder in class? Or was
    it the other way round? ;) The actual type  family was designed in 1990 and named
    for his wife. Which is sweet.\r\n\r\nI think the fact they seem pretty similar
    is because they're both by very talented, very Dutch ;) type designers who are
    about the same age and studied at the same school, the Koninklijke Academie van
    Beeldende Kunsten in The Hague, with the same tutor, Gerrit Noordzij, who is Peter-Matthias'
    father. And both typefaces were designed according to the same principle of the
    broad-nibbed pen.\r\n\r\nYou can find more info about the genesis of Thesis at
    Lucasfonts > The LF Font Families > Thesis Classic > Info & Samples. The most
    interesting part of the creation, its original design under the name Parenthesis
    as the \"corporate\" typeface for the ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat, is
    not included anymore, sadly enough.</em>"

  body: "Real Simple's logo (I prefer to use \"masthead\" to refer to the list of
    staff and contributors on the inside of the magazine) is *not* Interstate. It
    looks to be based on older gothics like Engravers Gothic. ITC Blair is a contemporary
    reworking of that style.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/engravers-gothic/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/blair-itc/\r\n\r\nAnd
    for the completists out there, the other typeface Real Simple uses is Meta, including
    the Hairline, Thin, and Extra Light weights, which were commissioned especially
    for the publication."
