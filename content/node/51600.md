body: Hi all. I've been trying to design a logo for a new arts and culture community
  called 'mill' I've been backwards forwards and all around with ideas but none seem
  to have any wow/clever or even 'oh that's nice' factor. Any thoughts? This is where
  I'm at at the moment and I really don't think I like any of them? see attached file

    & [[http://www.the-mill.com/|THAT]] for some inspiration perhaps. (also on what's
    been done already.)\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "I'm 100% with Penn on this one - most of these are far too busy, and the
    ones on the left are pretty much unreadable. These really need to be simplified
    down a lot! The right-hand pair are much better from a legibility point of view,
    but still don't really say 'Mill' to me. To me, the word <em>Mill</em> implies
    process, refinement, and movement - none of these really capture any of these
    things.\r\n\r\nAre you looking to create this entirely as a word mark, or have
    you considered using a more illustrative logo? Just wondering - you might find
    there's some good iconography to consider here!\r\n\r\nAndi\r\n\r\n[<a href='http://www.semibad.com'>semibad</a>]"

  body: "I'd not seen that before Penn's post - it's certainly clever, although I'll
    admit I wouldn't have been able to read it if I hadn't known it was supposed to
    be 'mill'. Certainly makes life harder for you though, Helen!\r\n\r\nTrouble is
    that if you go lowercase (and make use of that wonderful arrangement of letterforms)
    it's going to end up looking at least a bit like the logo above. Just while I
    was thinking about it, I sketched this out really quickly:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mill_6161.png]\r\n\r\nI
    do mean <em>really</em> quickly, so try not to laugh too much! Just to illustrate
    that if you take the nice curves from the bottom-right idea and put them throughout
    the mark, you could get a quite nice sense of depth to it, and give the idea of
    a mill building. It's still quite similar to the mill mark above, and there's
    more things wrong with it than right, but it's just to illustrate a point.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck with this one - it's a tough little project :)\r\n\r\nAndi\r\n\r\n[<a href='http://www.semibad.com'>semibad</a>]"

    Andi's thoughts on going illustrative; a nice mill illustration might work better
    for you."

    the same similarity, until I saw the connection had already been pointed out from
    the beginning.)

  body: "thanks everyone this is very useful. i'd read the link too I guess a bit
    of flattery in the form of similarity to the posted logo aint a bad thing! so
    i'm working on the top right one i posted as i agree with the logo designed by
    north you wouldn't have a clue it said mill unless someone told you so a bit strange
    it's so great in some respects. \r\nthe thing with an illustration is the logo
    is a mark for a new arts communities magazine cover and webspace/forum that will
    have the strapline 'creatives\u2013made and mixed' so I'd be concerned a windmill
    or similar would be to distinct and not really say much about the community which
    is encompassing arts from all genres.\r\nit's a toughie i've thought about somehow
    trying to get the idea of made and mixed across with an illustrative approach
    maybe something where the mark shape is that of a like building and then the dot
    of the i or something that cuts into the m maybe is like a mills propellers (is
    that even what they're called LOL) ??"
