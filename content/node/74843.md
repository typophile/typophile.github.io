  body: The second image suggests that you have already located the font; are you
    asking for a less expensive--or free-look-alike?

    a free look alike would just do it.

  body: "Gaspipe lettering was popular for signage in the 1930's. It's called gaspipe
    because the letterforms are constructed like pipes \u2013 long, vertical strokes
    connected to shorter horizontal strokes with rounded connectors."
