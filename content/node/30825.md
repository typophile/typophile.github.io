  body: sheesh. all i did was restructure the [[foundries]] page, as it was so large
    it wasn't accepting changes to the page. i do what i can to keep things in order
    there, but appreciate everyone's help. i see stewf's name is constantly on the
    contributers' list. hopefully this is becoming a useful resource for others besides
    just me!

    Oh wait. Darn it. Well, the only team that can beat the Saints is the Patriots.
