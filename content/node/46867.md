  body: Maybe it was handdrawn. I frequently will make an aphabet handdrawn, scan
    it in, and livetrace, or just save the scan for further use one day. It means
    having to set the type yourself, lining it up and everything, but maybe that's
    what this person is doing. Other than that, it reminds me of school house rock.
