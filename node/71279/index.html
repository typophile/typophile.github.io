  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi hello,</p>
<p>My friend asked me to make an online portfolio for her. She&rsquo;s an architecture graduate. So far, I haven&rsquo;t encountered that many individual architecture portfolios online, so I decided to seek for some feedback and some info on it here.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m working on at the moment is the type for her full name. I need something that would look good both in print and screen.</p>
<p>The aspects I doubt about are the width of the type and the unusual &ldquo;R&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve used (if the curve looks good or I don&rsquo;t need it at all?). I haven&rsquo;t dealt with the kerning on the bolder versions yet tho.</p>
<p>As you can see, it doesn&rsquo;t really resemble architecture itself. Is it a mistake?</p>
<p>You can consider me as an amateur in this field of typography, so maybe I&rsquo;m over thinking this whole thing and should stick with something clear/simple?</p>
<p>Looking forward to your opinions.</p>

<p>Now that I look at it, the &ldquo;O&rdquo; does seem a bit too small, thanks for correcting. I&rsquo;ve increased the size of it and slightly changed the curve as well. I think it does look a bit more natural now.</p>
<p>And yeas, the line&hellip; I was just testing how the type blends with geometric objects (the basis of my web design) and just left it there when saving the image.</p>
<p>@ill sans</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s what you meant, but I have tried making the curve matching the degree of the &ldquo;O&rdquo; and it turned out pretty appealing</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In the first of your fixed ones, the R has fallen below the baseline, and the curve is still off, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. The second is better, but to my eye the R looks like a P that&rsquo;s about to topple over towards the O, with a tail hanging on it in a rather unconnected way. I would curve the tail up a bit towards the Z as Riccardo suggests, and maybe make it connect to the bowl of the R slightly further to the right. I&rsquo;ve made a very crude example of what I mean in Paint, I&rsquo;ve tried to make the curve of the R be concentric with the O, look like it continues to the Z (I didn&rsquo;t succeed with that one very well), but also made it cross the baseline more or less at the furthest point of the bowl of the R (blue lines), where it would naturally stop if the R was just a letter with no continuing curve.</p>

<p>Just a suggestion from a non-designer who likes to look at things.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">That&rsquo;s what I had in mind! ;-)
Getting the tail of the R to look like a continuation of the diagonal of the Z would require a wider Z (to get a less steep diagonal) or discontinuing the concentrism with the O at some point&hellip;
What I would at least try is to make the Z &amp; A parallel as well since you seem to be aiming for a very clean geometric look with this logo.</div>
