body: "In 1864, the punchcutter Homan Hallock, who with Eli Smith was responsible
  for the admirable \u2018American Arabic\u2019 types that were used in the Van Dyck
  Bible translation, produced this experimental Arabic type. It may be the first attempt
  at systematic Arabic script reform, preceding the Cairo Academy initiative of 1933
  by almost seventy years. It doesn't seem to have been employed, except in the single
  specimen sheet produced by Hallock.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HallockExperimental600_3933.jpg]"

    one doesn't believe it's functional, it's still highly impressive to see such
    an effort, especially when you consider it was during the metal era.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hello John riccardo hrant and Aziz its been a couple of years since my last
    type activities.\r\n Thanks John for this specimen sheet of Hallock's type I heard
    about his work described by  Saad  Abulhab as a predecessor for  Saqqal's unconnected
    Unified Arabic type.  Some decades ago (tempus fugit!) I was experimenting with
    Apple's MacPaint using 'fatbit' mosaics to construct a font. It had the look of
    these letters here!  Hallock's glyphs seem to be generic multi-purpose shapes
    for example the 'jeem' also has a dot on top so the punch can be used to create
    jeem ha kha. Same from the ba ta tha noon where all the dots are featured to be
    'deleted' later.  Interesting - it shows he was serious about the possibility
    of creating an actual typeface for practical use.  "
