  fine on the mac but when trying it on the PC in Indesign CS 2 it doesn't. I can
  see the name in the font list but when I select it the font doesn't change and that
  font style is removed from the font list. I know this could be any number of things,
  but are there thing I should be checking when I generate the fonts. I've generated
  the PS font family which works fine on both platforms.\r\n\r\nc."

    (Indesign, Illustrator). Photoshop 7 for the PC, the fonts work fine. I only have
    demo versions of CS 2 cos I dont really use PC, could the fact that they are demo
    versions be the probelm ?\r\n\r\nc."

    Have you tried running them through the Microsoft Font Validator? "

  body: "Adobe apps need/use different naming then Word for example, it's quite tricky.\r\nThere
    have been a couple of good threads on naming opentype families on the forums,
    if you search for 'Font Family Naming in Fontlab', you should find what you need.
    For example <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/31118\">this thread</a>, with
    replies from Adam Twardoch, who works at Fontlab Ltd. :) Those are mostly about
    OTF-naming. I'm not sure if it's different for OT-TT's. But maybe it's of any
    use.\r\n"

    using a demo version of CS 2 to test the fonts. I tested the fonts on a friends

    know if anyone can confirm this.\r\n\r\nc."

    Word. \r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n\r\nOpenType TTF and OpenType OTF work on all applications
    on Mac.\r\nOpenType TTF works on all applications on PC\r\nOpenType OTF Doesn't

  body: "Well, I make OTF fonts in Fontlab all the time, and can use them in Adobe
    apps on PC without any problems. So it should work.\r\nBut the Windows font-directory
    is quite.. odd. Sometimes it helps to delete the font, and install it again. And
    also make sure the Adobe apps are not running while installing the fonts. Normally
    that shouldn't matter, but unfortunately it does. For me, anyway. :)"
