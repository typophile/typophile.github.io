body: ". I had some good feed back from the previos post. I was informed a grid system
  wasnt appropriate \r\n in the last post.  \r\n\r\nI have now posted my cv. i think
  a two column layout might work.  As i dont know much about the grid \r\nsytems.
  I  am trying to find out what be appropriate margin size . i am using heveltica
  10 regular  \r\nwhich has leading of 14 pts. \r\nIve  read that its good practicce
  to make the margin width the same size as the body text leading . \r\nIs this true
  as i am unsure \r\n\r\nthank you \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://fav.me/d7xsel1\r\nlayout

  body: "Just a couple of quick notes.\r\nYes to make the two columns equal in width.\r\nNo
    need to align the title inside the columns.\r\nIn general, margins should be wide
    enough to frame text and pictures, but narrow enough to keep all together. Also
    consistency is a good thing.\r\nYou should also check text alignment (and revise
    body copy in order to consistently use proper typographic elements such as apostrophes,
    en-dashes, etc.)."

  body: "I know you didn't ask for advice regarding this, but your layout is full
    of misalignments, inconsistent capitalization and punctuation, etc. Most readers
    won't care if a margin is a few points off, but these kinds of mistakes will be
    immediately obvious to everyone. \r\n\r\nPlus the type in the lower right is totally
    unreadable on my monitor.\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase what I said in an earlier post,
    I think you're focusing on the wrong things. For a small layout like this, instead
    of worrying about grids and the exact width of a column or margin, focus on making
    it an attractive, easy-to-read layout."

    body: 512pixel, try learning and using InDesign for your layout. Illustrator is
      for illustrating.

  body: "My own critic of my works is i dontlike the black gaps to wide in the space.
    \ Especialing with the white writing. This apparent near the top were i have two
    margins \r\n\r\n\r\n i can post pic of this so i can see were  i can see bad use
    of spacingt . I am thinking o f moving some of the text off the baseline grid.
    As weant the gaps closer together between the blackk and grey  \r\nWhich currenlty
    is all aligned to baseline grid . The colour aslo transormed to cmyk  when exporting
    as pdf .\r\n\r\nI will post this later \r\n\r\nhttp://fav.me/d7yrm1d"

    easier to read.\r\n\r\nI hesitate to say this, but some of your posts are hard
    for me to understand due to odd sentence structure, misspellings, etc. Maybe you're
    just typing fast, but it's important for graphic designers to be able to communicate
    clearly in writing as you'll need to communicate with clients, managers, co-workers,
    write proposals and contracts, etc. "

    \"computer\" graphic design is unnecessary; who does graphic design any other
    way these days?\r\n\r\nI would put your software skills at the bottom, not the
    top.\r\n\r\nProofread! You have many misspelled words and incorrect or misplaced
    punctuation marks. Get a friend to read over it for you.\r\n\r\nHow about putting
    your name somewhere prominent?\r\n\r\nYou can do better than Helvetica. Helvetica
    may be many things, but unique it is not. You want to stand out.\r\n\r\nThe dark
    grey type is hard to read.\r\n\r\nFor bullet lists, align runover lines with the
    first line of the bulleted paragraph.\r\n\r\nMake it a standard paper size.\r\n\r\nMany
    people have a hard time taking \"Hotmail\" addresses seriously. Some e-mail services
    are widely seen as more professional than others. Gmail is a safe bet.\r\n\r\nOrganize
    the document with subheads: Work Experience / Education / Special Skills etc."
