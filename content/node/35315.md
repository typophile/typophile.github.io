  the opportunity to get in touch with metal typesetting but...\r\n\r\nWhile reading
  Meggs' \"A History of Graphic Design\", on page 81 (3rd ed.), he describes the book
  <em>Teuerdank,</em> printed by Johann Sch\xF6nsperger with type designed by Vincenz
  Rockner in 1517. According to Meggs:\r\n\r\n<cite>Rockner carried this design quality</cite>
  [the quality of Rockner's fraktur compared to Gutenberg's textura] <cite>even further
  in a heroic effort to duplicate the gestural freedom of the pen. As many as eight
  alternate characters were designed and cast for each letterform. These had sweeping
  calligraphic flourishes, some of which flowed deep into the surrounding space. Other
  printers insisted that these ornamental letterforms had to be printed from woodblocks,
  for they refused to believe that it was possible to achieve these effects with cast
  metal types. (An inverted <em>i</em> in the 1517 edition, however, conclusively
  proves that metal types were used to print Teuerdank.)</cite>\r\n\r\nAfter reading
  this paragraph two questions came to my mind:\r\n\r\n1. If it wasn't for the inverted
  <em>i,</em> telling the difference from a woodblock print or a typeset ornament
  wouldn't be possible? Isn't it possible to tell the difference between these two
  techniques of printing just by looking at the printed piece? The thickness of ink,
  the irregularity of the shapes or something like that?\r\n\r\n2. How was it possible
  to set those flourishes in metal type? Were they a whole piece of metal or maybe
  divided into several smaller parts put together?\r\n\r\nIf you don't have Meggs'
  book nearby you can read about <em>Teuerdank</em> and take a look at some pictures
  here: http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/feb2005.html\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's
  impressive..."

    right now I'm up to the third to last chapter. I'll have to go back to the beginning
    once I'm done.\r\n\r\nGetting back to reality, yes, Rockner's stuff is really
    great, although I don't recall it as vividly as some other images I saw."

    overlaps and puzzle style letters that allow for contextual alteration. So the
    answer to your question is yes.\r\n\r\nI am really interested in this kind of
    thing. Do the images shown at your linked URL show any other these flourishes?\r\n"

    with the caption "title" is especially interesting as some flourishes do not connect
    to the letters below them...

    hand, outsourcing the work to hard-up scribes who were casualties of the new media.
