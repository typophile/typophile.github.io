  I am working on a huge contract designing custom photo albums evocative of coffee
  table books such as one would buy at the giftshops in museums. So the typefaces
  need to have a classic quality to them, they can be both classic fonts and modern
  streamlined fonts depending on the theme of the albums, be it weddings or births.\r\n\r\nFinally,
  does anyone recognize the fonts used in Martha Stewart's everyday food magazines?\r\n\r\nThanks
  ever so much."

    didn't specify which parts of the MS magazine you wanted ID'd, but I know the
    ones I've seen use a lot of Gotham and Whitney, both from <a href=http://www.typography.com\">H&FJ</a>.
    Good luck."

  body: "Well, if I used the right fonts for the mock albums, they would make me look
    good, no?\r\n\r\nYou're right - complEmentary fonts - that's what I'm looking
    for.\r\n\r\nFor the Martha Steward EveryDay Food magazines, I am looking at the
    September 2003 issue. It's a nice light font with slight serifs - rather friendly
    looking. Ideal for baby albums, I think.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "Archer is not actually H&FJ's \"newest\" type family for Martha, just the
    most recent one that they're finally able to release for public license. Archer
    was designed back in c.2002. The Walbaum-ish serif face that they designed for
    <cite>Martha Stewart Living</cite> is newer (can't remember the name offhand),
    but isn't available for license. But I suppose I'm just nitpicking semantics.\r\n\r\nMartha's
    <cite>Everyday Food</cite> magazine uses Whitney pretty much throughout, almost
    exclusively. There are some numbers that look like Clarendon or Belizio (or perhaps
    custom from H&FJ in the same vein). But otherwise, Whitney Whitney Whitney. Unless
    something's changed in the last several months since I looked at a copy.\r\n\r\n--

  body: "Oh, sorry, didn't see your post about 2003 until after I posted mine. They
    may not have had the Whitney fonts in 2003. I don't have a 2003 copy around, so
    I can't say. Sounds like it might be Archer, which they were still getting a lot
    of mileage from in the Living series. I wouldn't be surprised if they launched
    Everyday Food in the same fonts as Living to piggyback on the brand, and only
    later distinguished it by shifting fonts. (I have a 2005 issue in Whitney as I
    described.)\r\n\r\nIf you posted a scan, I'm sure we could ID the 2003 fonts for
    you.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'If you want museum art-book elegance, that''s easy: Linotype Sabon with oldstyle
    figures (or the Adobe OpenType version), and, very selectively, Linotype Syntax
    with oldstyle figures. Sabon is very popular for museum displays and catalogues:
    in my view, it is the most nearly perfect serif there is. And Linotype Syntax
    is superior because its base weight is not too heavy, as with so many other sans
    families. Just remember the oldstyle figures--always makes a really nice difference.
    In my experience, Sabon looks best set 11/15.'

    - looking up Sabon right now - yep, I have it. Thank you for the suggestions.

    and Maag foundries have type testers where you can set up two (or more) types
    beside one another.\r\nReminds me of type specimens where the pages are cut horizontally
    into three, so that you can view bits of different pages with other bits, if you
    know what I mean.\r\nThere was a children's book I recall, Victorian possibly,
    <em>Heads Bodies and Legs</em> -- from which the surrealist game <em>The Exquisite
    Corpse</em> may have been derived."
