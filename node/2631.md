  body: Looks pretty mr bluett. You have some spacing issues  <BR>between the N and
    Y, maybe try opening the whole thing <BR>up a little. I am not particulary mad
    about the ultra-sharp <BR>terminals on the E,N,Y. They don&#39;t seem too organic
    and <BR>coffee like. Don&#39;t spend too long on this, they might not  <BR>appreciate
    it ; &#41; <BR> <BR>love kris

  body: The E with the wavy crosspiece definitely evokes a very coffeehouse image
    in my mind.  That said, I&#39;m not sure how well the bottom serifs on the N and
    Y work with the rest of the glyphs.  The letter forms &#40;contrasting with ornament&#41;
    seem to ride high, and don&#39;t have the bulk of the E,B, and O - an impression
    only accentuated with the crossbar of the N riding so high.  It&#39;s not really
    an issue of color, the word EBONY just seems to fizzle and die at the end. <BR>
    <BR>Realize that this comes from someone who could probably never equal your work,
    so a critique is really all I have for you.  I don&#39;t know how else to preserve
    the elements of the face in the N and Y, so I guess it&#39;s up to you to decide
    whether I&#39;m full of it. <BR> <BR>PS, I like this face a lot.  It seems to
    have a lot of the soul of the old-west woodcut lettering with a distinctly modern
    feel - a potent and interesting combination.

  body: Ah, here is a gif. I haven&#39;t altered anything yet. I will have a better
    look at the N anf Y since there is some doubt about them. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23754.gif"

  body: It seems to me that you are borrowing from alot of influances and not focusing
    on one direction. Try one pencil version of each idea, like african or Victorian
    and then see if they work. Focus the concept then execute
