  body: The shapes of the lc &#34;a&#34; &#34;d&#34; and &#34;k&#34; and uc &#34;I&#34;,
    and the inconsistencies in the design have me believe this might be custom drawn.
    I think maybe we can whup up a typeface that&#39;s similar and that could be a
    good starting point if you&#39;re willing to go through some customizing. <BR>
    <BR>BTW We&#39;re all rank amateurs here, only some of us are better at hiding
    it than others. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: It&#39;s hard for me to believe that an inn at Lake Tahoe, a small resort
    town in the mountains between California and Nevada, would have the resources
    to commission a custom logo. In many ways the face reminds me of  <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/americana/">Americana</a>,
    though I know that&#39;s not a match, and I couldn&#39;t find one myself.

  body: 'Oh but I totally agree, Chesh, I find that equally hard to believe: I never
    said I thought they <i>commissioned</i> a custom logo. It looks more like some
    poorly skilled but highly motivated person drew it. The lettershapes have that
    lovely wobbly inconsistent vernacular feel to them, and I don&#39;t think Tibor
    Kalman&#39;s responsible for that. ;&#41;'
