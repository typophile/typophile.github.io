  a friends skateboard company. I would like to try and ID the typeface used on this
  vintage jewelry we found when doing some image research for an idea we have for
  a board - i know that it has had some treatment by giving it the swoosh underline,
  can anyone throw some light on which was the original typeface? Is it a set of characters
  with a swashes?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks again as always, typophile hasn't let us down
  yet! "
