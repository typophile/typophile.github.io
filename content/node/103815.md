  body: "Letterhead has a great collection of fonts inspired by pre-WWI signs and
    lettering.  \r\nThe tilde shaped feature in the middle of the O is sometimes called
    a flame. The feature seems to have been invented by a book cover letterer, Henry
    Thayler, in the 1890s. In addition to the center of the O, flames sometimes appeared
    above the serif at the end of the arm in L, running leftward from the apex of
    the A, replacing the crossbar in E, F, H and A, and elsewhere. Some fonts of the
    era included flames. They were more common in hand painted signs and in book covers.
    Unfortunately, I don't recall offhand another digital font with the flame feature
    in O.\r\nDon"

    supppose <a href='http://www.psyops.com/download/Psy_Retablo.pdf' target='_blank'>Retablo</a>
    (link is a PDF) could be considered to be flaming, eh? Including a flame <em>outside</em>
    the o/O."

  body: "Yes, Mike, a tilde/flame dingbat under the O was a part of an Arts & Crafts
    style. A representative fancy book cover from about 1896:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Violin1896ca_5850.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Violin1896caDetail_4739.jpg]\r\nRetablo
    catches some of the style, but the addition of spurs is something the Arts & Crafts
    letterers  would have rejected as old fashioned and un-cool. For that reason I
    see Retablo as a modern fusion design. \r\nIn addition to the tilde/flame dingbats,
    this Arts & Crafts style often had the cross bars pushed to the top,  a  graceful
    R, and the diagonal part of the N intersecting the right hand stroke above the
    bottom corner.\r\nIMO this is a good style to exploit for some new fonts.\r\nDon"

    ornaments. Don't know if such a discussion fits the type ID board. If it does,
    I will start a new thread with the names of what I have found & ask what other
    names might be known to our cognoscenti. Otherwise perhaps I should try general
    discussions?\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "To add to what Don has said, the flame shape was also called \u2018cyma \u2019.
    It widely used in sign painting and lettering from 1900 to 1930 aprox.\r\n\r\nHere
    is a short paragraph from a old book on sign painting:\r\n\u201C... a short pen
    or brush stroke termed the cyma, on account of its resemblance to the curve of
    the Greek moldings of that name. The purpose of the cyma in lettering is to fill
    the space between the slanting parts of the letters, or extremities of letters
    where wide openings are likely to appear where the letters are placed together.
    It is also used as an integral part of some letters... \u201D\r\n\r\nThis is from
    another book:\r\n\u201C... Note the frequent use of the cyma in this alphabet
    as in A, for its cross-bar ; in C, to fill space and add grace ; between M and
    L, again to fill up excess of space; in Q, where it properly belongs, as in the
    Roman Q; in W, again to fill space, this time serving to take away the appearance
    of too great width in that letter; finally in &, where it makes a most graceful
    part of the ampersand.... \u201D"

  body: "Found this info on a <a href=\"http://www.woodworkinghistory.com/glossary_cyma_curve.htm\">
    woodworking site</a>:\r\n----start quote----\r\ncyma: Cyma comes from the Greek
    word meaning wave. A molding in common use, with a simple waved line concave at
    one end and convex at the other end, similar in form to an italic I. When the
    concave part is uppermost the molding is called cyma recta, but if the convexity
    appears above and the concavity below the molding is known as cyma reversa.\r\n\r\n(Another
    term for cyma curve is \"S-curve\" Some cyma curves were small, like those at
    the top of many cabriole legs; others were large, like that of the leg itself.
    See for example, chapter one of Norman Vandal's book on Queen Anne, in sources\r\n\r\nIn
    1906, a Princeton professor, Allan Marquand exhaustively traced the history of
    both these terms in the English language -- box below.)\r\n\r\n    \"... [F]rom
    current European terminlogy ... the words cyma recta and cyma reversa represent
    a usage practically confined to Britain and the English speaking people. How then
    id these terms come to be adopted in Britain? ... [I]t came this way. In 1715
    an Italian name Giacomo Leoni was brought over to Britain by Lord Burlington to
    assist in the translation of the architectural works of Palladio, published in
    that year. This English edition of Palladio, subsequently republished with annotations
    of Inigo Jones, had no little influence on Englsih architects and architectural
    terminology\")\r\n----end quote---\r\nThis seems to explain the use of the terms
    in the books Pablo cited.\r\nDon\r\n"
