  in the field of fashion and magazines.\r\n\r\nis there any category name for those
  fonts or does anyone know where there came from or what background they have?\r\n\r\neven
  a few names from similary ones would help!!!!!\r\n\r\nhttp://industriemagazine.com\r\nhttp://www.saturday-group.com\r\ni
  am sure the font from saturday for industrie magazine is custom made but there are
  so many out there right now there must be some mainstream version :)\r\n\r\ni am
  not looking for slabserif or egyptienne.\r\nand i am aware that bodoni does have
  a good contrast in the line width :)\r\n\r\nthanks so much!\r\n"

    a list of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/extra_bold_high_contrast_serifs/?affid=99346\">high
    contrast serifs</a> at FontShop, but these are much bolder than your sample which
    is really not that high contrast, it's just very light. So see their <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/extra_light_serifs/?affid=99346\">extra
    light serifs</a> as well. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bp_type_foundry/sangbleu_family_pack_ot_bp/?affid=99346\">SangBleu</a>
    seems to be the closest to what you're after."

  body: "thank you!\r\n\r\nthe list from fontshop is very nice, but i think the \"modern\"
    touch of the fonts i mean, comes from very black serifs.\r\nhard to explain but
    it always feels like they are to heavy for the letter, thats why they are often
    based on a light version, i guess.\r\nmaybe they just using display fonts, and
    thats the trick :)\r\n\r\nbut i would call sangbleu definitely one of them.\r\ni
    am still looking for more examples."
