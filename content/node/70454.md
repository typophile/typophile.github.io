body: "I'm a young teacher who is interested in framing a print of William Ernest
  Henley's poem Invictus in the complicated typeface Zapfino. I am experienced with
  computers, but not at all with digital typography. Zapfino Extra has many guidelines
  for usage, and this is probably not a job I can handle myself. Not to mention, I
  don't own the font family and it's very expensive.\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions
  about how I might be able to have this done? A copy of the poem and a couple links
  of interest are provided. Thank you!\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapfino\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/2762-17899/tipsandrecommendations.html\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOut
  of the night that covers me,\r\nBlack as the pit from pole to pole,\r\nI thank whatever
  gods may be\r\nFor my unconquerable soul.\r\n\r\nIn the fell clutch of circumstance\r\nI
  have not winced nor cried aloud.\r\nUnder the bludgeonings of chance\r\nMy head
  is bloody, but unbowed.\r\n\r\nBeyond this place of wrath and tears\r\nLooms but
  the Horror of the shade,\r\nAnd yet the menace of the years\r\nFinds and shall find
  me unafraid.\r\n\r\nIt matters not how strait the gate,\r\nHow charged with punishments
  the scroll,\r\nI am the master of my fate:\r\nI am the captain of my soul."

  body: Also, I have learned that Mac OS X includes Zapfino, and its word processor
    Pages appears to modify the glyphs according to the characters adjacent. Noting
    this, it might be possible for me to do this myself, but I think I would still
    need some guidance. Thanks.

    I believe I'll need to switch to Illustrator to access the hyper-flourishes.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/invictus_4634.png]

  body: "Okay, well apparently I'm talking to myself, now, but I was able to find
    the glyph selector on Mac, so I took the liberty of adding some style. I hope
    it's not too much. Can anyone please provide their thoughts? I would like this
    to look professional.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm noticing the new version is somewhat harder
    to read though I payed more attention to avoiding glyph contact between the lines.
    Is this because the flourishes are larger?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/invictus_5466.png]"

  body: "This must be the best specimen of Zapfino I've seen in a while. I always
    see Zapfino on garbage bins and in ugly logos.\r\n\r\nI had trouble understanding
    the poem but readability was fine. I wouldn't worry about how easy it is to read
    this from a distance. When you're reading from close proximity a major problem
    is character recognition, you know if a certain letter looked like another or
    if it doesn't look like any at all. But in the case of Zapfino it's such a well-drawn
    typeface with a very solid calligraphic background and all the flourishes and
    the styling do not add any ambiguity.\r\n\r\nI think you've done a great job on
    the second one, you made it more even in texture. I would be tempted to set WILLIAM
    ERNEST HENLEY - INVICTUS in serif capitals. Something like  Hoefler All Caps at
    a height a little larger than the Zapfino x-height in the text. Naaah forget I
    said that you probably want the name of the author to be prominent.\r\n\r\nOther
    than that add more margin especially on the sides (if you can I don't know maybe
    this is the ratio you're working with).\r\n\r\nOh and if you're interested in
    Herman Zapf's lettering take a look at [[http://vimeo.com/5385464|this video]].\r\n"
