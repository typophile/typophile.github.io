body: Dear Typophiles, <BR> <BR>I am looking for some information regarding the Meta
  typeface family by Erik Spiekermann.  It is my understanding that the typeface was
  simply re-branded as Meta from it&#39;s original release as Meta&#43;.  Could anyone
  inform me if there are any typographic differences between the 2 versions, that
  I should be aware of? <BR> <BR>Thanks for your time. <BR> <BR>What a great site.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>Neil

  body: Hi there, <BR> <BR>I think the difference is in the figures, in one release
    they are old style and in another there also titlely figures. Of course you know
    the story behind Meta? It started out life as a corporate font for Deutsche Post
    &#40;German postal company&#41; but half way through they pulled the plug on the
    project. Anyway, their loss; its a great font. <BR> <BR>Chris
