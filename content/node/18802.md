  on the eternal quest of making a font\r\nlook good (but to me at least never \"the
  same\") both in print\r\nand on screen, I have a question:\r\n\r\nWhat's the relative
  effort involved in getting this\r\noutline \"g\" (slightly modified from Patria)
  to render\r\nout this bitmap \"g\", preferably robustly on as many\r\nplatforms
  and applications as possible.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/render_g.gif]\r\n\r\nOne
  way is to make two separate fonts, one outline, one pixelfont*.\r\nAnother is to
  superhint, like the previous generation of MS core fonts,\r\nbut with the difference
  that grayscaling is enabled. A third is to -come\r\nclose, and in some ways exceed-
  using CT, using some level of hinting\r\n(which I'm not clear on). For the purposes
  of this discussion I will add\r\nthat -if it makes a big difference- you can assume
  the top of the lower\r\nbowl of that outline \"g\" to be flat -and even uniform
  in weight- instead.\r\n\r\n* Or a raw bitmap font, in special situations.\r\n\r\nSo
  I'm wondering what are the relative efforts, as well as\r\nthe relative technical
  impediments in terms of delivery,\r\nof the various methods. Thank you.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Spec? Wazzat?\r\n\r\nMaybe this: a TT font populated with \"normal\" outlines
    (leftmost \"g\"), but that renders out specific grayscale bitmaps (righthand \"g\"s)
    at certain PPEMs. My sample bitmap \"g\" is from an existing (but still in development)
    14* PPEM serif pixelfont, which however has quite \"abnormal\" outlines (because
    without hinting that's the only way to get specific grayscale bitmaps).\r\n\r\n*
    Or 15 if you want to include a blank topmost row (although that's a\r\ngracious
    sacrifice of apparent size that's been unfashionable for years).\r\n\r\nSo how
    painful would it be to superhint a normal outline font to render out bitmaps like
    that? One reason I ask is because I wonder why it's never been done (AFAIK). Although
    maybe the Next Big Thing became ClearType so superhinting* was exiled from the
    Republic. And speaking of CT, would that be any better in terms of reducing effort?
    I'm assuming CT can render out \"normal\" (full-pixel), non-colorized bitmaps.\r\n\r\n*
    Which interestingly however is not mutually exclusive with CT, so...\r\n\r\nAs
    for the cross-platform, cross-app wish, that might actually be pretty hopeless,
    seeing as how OSX mostly ignores hints. On the other hand, CT-style fonts might
    actually work when OSX's subpixel rendering is enabled? What's funny BTW is that
    the existing format of my pixelfont actually ensures consistent rendering across
    platforms! The only other way to do that these days seems to be to settle for
    Fabulous Full Fuzz on both platforms!  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n\r\n"

    Mike told me that, but ... I'm not sure. Perhaps I have diagonal hinting in mind.
    I believe Bistream Vera family was also hinted for grayscale rendering (by FreeType)."
