  it in PC type 1 format. When the company install the fonts onto their aged bespoke
  systems, everything is fine, but for some very strange reason the space character
  is much bigger than it should be. When you highlight the character on their machines,
  you can see an extra space appears to be added.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like a problem
  with them, but they already have several hundred other fonts, where this isn't a
  problem. This makes me think it's a problem inside the font.\r\n\r\nHas anyone experienced
  this? I wonder whether the data that holds the width of the space character might
  be duplicated somewhere, and the duplicate is different.\r\n\r\nYours... at the
  end of his tether."

  body: "The bespoke software unfortunately is the only one of its kind in operation,
    and the makers disappeared into the ether soon after it was sold years ago. It
    runs on pc's, and perhaps I'm being naive here, but the encoding I used was 'default
    encoding'. The fonts also get converted into a software native binary file, but
    that's probably more of interest than of help.\r\n\r\nThe problem still has yet
    to be fixed and I'm now changing the encoding to 'windosws ANSI. I'm also weaving
    myself a long rope."

  body: "All you can do is give them a variety of options to try out, until you come
    across something that works. And give the optional fonts markedly different (silly,
    even) names and numbers, to avoid conflicts.\r\nI've had various problems to do
    with naming and encoding, and it seems to me it's best just to find something
    that works, rather than figure out the whys and wherefores, or who's responsible."
