  body: Mike, I would think the only way to know is to peek inside the PDF. Other
    than that I don't know. Wish I knew.

    InDesign etc.

  body: "Acrobat tries to match the weight and proportions of the missing font, then
    modifies either Adobe Sans or Adobe Serif to match as near as possible. So, what
    it looks like it's simulating is a very light serif font with an unusually narrow
    S and T and wide lowercase letters. My guess would be ITC Serif Gothic Extra Light.

    answer is right,although wouldn't you say that condensed and normal letters are
    mixed in the sample?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
