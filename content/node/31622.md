body: I am holding a branding workshop for highschool students of an after school
  media arts program in april. I am interested in any suggestions that may help me
  educate the students about the world of branding, design, typography, etc... These
  students will have little to no experience in this field of course, so I am starting
  from scratch. The workshop is very short term and my intend goals are for each student
  to produce a logo type and an advert implementing it. Any suggestions, ideas, resources
  would be much appreciated.

    by Jonathan Hoefler can be of any use? For a bit of history on type. There should
    be some more courses by him on typophile, but it''s hardly accessable, unfortunately. '
