body: "Hello! I am looking for the best font to write a printed formal letter to a
  respectable doctor (a professor) I have never ever written to. It must leave a good
  impression since he is very bussy and would surely dismiss a poorly written letter.
  I have the letter written in Word 2013 (Calibri). I can rewrite it in LaTeX (probably
  using LyX) if necessary. I prefer free fonts but I am willing to pay for a good
  font if necessary. Thanks for help.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Slazer, \r\nIf your \"respectable doctor\" is worth his salt, he certainly
    will value the content of your letter above the chosen font. That is, as long
    as you keep your choice professional and understated. Put your effort in a well-written
    and concise letter, instead of spending money on a font.\r\n\r\nIf he has a personal
    assistant, call her to verify the smartest way to get your message across. Often
    it is the assistant who does the reading anyway, and then shares the information
    if it is relevant enough.\r\n\r\nGood luck,"

    in the content, logical structure and grammar. I just need to improve the look.
    I have decided to definitely use LaTeX instead of Word for the obvious reason.
    It was created for printed documents anyway.\r\n\r\nThanks for mentioning the
    personal assistant - I did not thing of that. Good point!"

    LaTeX for a letter is a bit overkill.\r\nOf course, it\u2019s a matter of using
    the tool you know better how to handle in order to obtain the desired output.
    \r\n(that\u2019s why I often end up using InDesign for some of my letters ;)"

  body: I use LaTeX for my letters; the letter class http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Letters
    works fine. To get palatino, you put in the preamble <code>\usepackage{palatino}</code>
    or <code>\usepackage{mathpazo}</code> if you have mathematical formulas. The class
    also works fine with XeLaTeX, which allows you to use opentype and truetype fonts.

  body: "Slazer, I think you're overthinking this. I'm not a fan of Word, but in this
    case, Word would be fine. There's no need for LaTex when all you're composing
    is a single letter.\r\n\r\nUse a nice, cotton paper stock paired with a conservative
    serif typeface and just make it look professional. If this professor is like most
    professors I know, your carefully chosen type won't even be noticed, and the reply
    will be scribbled back to you on a Post-It note or in an email typed out in Comic
    Sans. ;-)"

    legibly, and hand-address the envelope too."

    classic serif. I assume you know how to fold a letter correctly, right? Plus,
    if you write the addresses on the envelope by hand, make sure they are legible
    :-) \r\n\r\n"
