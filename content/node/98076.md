  body: "How would you make E lighter?\r\n\r\nSince this is for a logo, I thought
    starting the word with a wider L is better. You did not like the empty space between
    L and O, is that it?\r\n\r\nHow about the weights of O and V?"

  body: Horizontal of L could be a bit thicker.

  body: I agree. I did make L thicker and bars of E narrower in a variation, but is
    it OK to use different thickness for L and E?

  body: "As Fiona Ross recently said: \"To make things look the same you have to make
    them different.\"  :-)\r\n\r\nThickening the horizontal of the \"L\" might mean
    it can stay that width.\r\n\r\nLightening the \"E\": try making the vertical thinner.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Nice quote :)\r\n\r\nOkay I know equal and optically equal are not the same.
    Horizontals vary, but verticals of L and E are almost always the same in typeforms,
    aren't they? Just trying to understand the basics a little bit."

  body: It's a question of what you can get away with in a given setting. If the /L/
    and /E/ were next to each other, the eye would be less forgiving about unequal
    stroke widths. Type designers have to allow for that, but logo designers don't!

  body: Hmm, I see your point... Fair enough. I'll post a rounded version here shortly.

  body: "If the word is part of a larger logo, then nitpicking it as a stand-alone
    element is fruitless. It would have to be seen in context.  If it's the entire
    logo, than it appears somewhat elephantine - more so in the reversed version.
    If it's to appear both black on white and white on black, the word should be optically
    corrected to look the same in both environments. And it will be different when
    printed than on a screen, and different depending on the sizes and resolutions
    of the media.\r\n\r\nThe space between the L and O will disappear in some sizes
    and circumstances.\r\n\r\nYou asked if it's OK for the L and E to have different
    dimensions - if it looks right, then yes.\r\nTo me, the spaces between the E's
    crossbars look very small. The optical effect is that the E's top and bottom crossbars
    look considerably fatter than the L's horizontal, even though they're the same.
    That may be why eliason said to make L's horizontal wider.\r\n\r\nYou're trying
    to design a VISUAL identity, not a mathematical one. What you SEE is always more
    important than what's actually there\r\n\r\n- Herb"

  body: "Variation with rounded corners.\r\n\r\nI adjusted horizontals of L and E,
    narrowed V and O a little.\r\n\r\nHerb, I recently read a text about a new typeface
    which claims it's optically adjusted for negative use but could not find it now.
    Does this mean not all -even pro- typefaces are crafted for negative use?\r\n\r\n<img
