    well respected on the Mac OS side.

  body: I'm on trial of font explorer, it seems like it lacks a lot of features that
    typeDNA has like harmony, find fonts according to weight, serif only etc etc.

  body: "Does it say anywhere how it determines things like serif vs. sans, etc.?
    \ Fonts have the capability to have that information in the Panose area. Unfortunately,
    in a large percentage of fonts the Panose information is, to say the least, weak.\r\n\r\n

  body: "I'm not sure but it worked quite well. You can try it for 2 month(I think)
    and try it yourself. visit http://typedna.com/\r\nAs for the moment it gives me
    best experience. The font preview is sharp compared to others(to my eye). You
    can also access google webfont and activate the font directly. I tried FontXplorer
    and didnt like it, Still considering purchasing TypeDNA or not. "

    not Panose info...
