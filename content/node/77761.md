body: "Hi everyone! \r\n\r\nI need to choose the Colour for my latest logo. The logo
  is of a Renewable Energy Company called \"Natural Power\" and it needs to communicate
  profesionality and eco-friendliness. \r\n\r\nFor this purpose we already established
  the form of it, a simple text with a leaf recall on the word \"Natural\".Also, the
  word power is in bold to emphatize it's meaning.\r\n\r\nWe are now arrived at the
  colouring stage.\r\n\r\nYou can find two pictures with 3 concepts each. Wich one
  do you think will be more effective, taking in consideration that it will be printed
  on cardboard with a little emboss going down? Wich one does it seem to fit better
  to the eco friendly image of the company in yours opinion? Thanks for taking the
  time[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DUE_3844.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DUE_3844.jpg]"

  body: I personally prefer the brown. The pale green has too little colour contrast
    for my liking.

  body: "If you make the background green and the gap in the a a little bigger the
    leaf will become much more obvious. Right now it's only visible when you're looking
    closely at the logo. I'm not saying. The typeface you used lacks a little friendlyness
    IMO. I think Nota has the appearance you're looking for, though you'll have to
    change the /a/ somewhat to make it look like a leaf. http://www.typonine.com/fonts/nota/otf_font_tester/\r\nKeep
    going!"

  body: "The brown looks very nice. Though the green seems to say grass, it does remind
    me more of the environment in a pleasing way. Maybe you should try and darker
    green? I sort of like the green but not quite.\r\n\r\nAnd a BIG second to the
    stem of the leaf--it has gone missing. Now it looks like an accident.\r\n\r\nPS:\r\n\r\nYou're
    SURE you can't find an hour to give the bowl of that A back it's contrast?! It
    can be a very nice logo with just a tad bit more work! Don't let something you
    could be proud of slip away."

  body: "Hi again and thanks to everyone for the comments!\r\n\r\n\r\nWe think we'll
    go for a green or brown at this point, and Definetly enlarge the gap of the leaf
    . If you still have other suggestions don't hesitate, we're still working on it...\r\n\r\nthanks
    again,\r\n\r\nPier\r\n"

    in the same branch who has a very similar logo to ours, with the same name. At
    this point I had to quickly change it with this version for legal reasons. What
    do you think?\r\n\r\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/content_round.php?page=done&l=img11/1073/naturalweb.png&via=mupload\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPier"

  body: "yeah, you're right hola.\r\n\r\nThe point is I never ended up with a \"text
    in a shape\" solution, and I'm afraid it could be interfering with the communication
    objectives of eco friendlyness and expandability. what do you think? Could it
    work"

  body: Would be good to know what that competitor's logo looks like. Happy accident
    perhaps as this is a nice idea but WAY too subtle in present execution to read.
    Agree looks like printing error (the stem looks like a printing hickey) and subliminally
    just pick up 'a's don't match which is worrying. Leaf 'a' just looks weak and
    increase of negative space through adaption unbalances word. Adjusting letterspacing
    between 'r' and 'a' may help but may have knock on effect as you are playing with
    'colour' of face. Need MUCH more contrast between 'a's to work. Very hard to get
    them to contrast and balance convincingly. Could repeat leaf as bowl of 'a' for
    both occurrences. Still tough to pull off (perhaps why you have been so tentative?)
    but nice idea to explore. I would definitely work on keeping outer shape of 'a'
    intact and just changing inner, thus leave integrity of letter shape alone. This
    would help make an inner leaf shape clearer and much more obvious what it is.
    Whole letter would be emphasised but not distorted (this is hard to explain in
    just words!). I would keep question of typeface and leaf shape open to discover
    what worked. Is this leaf idea what your competitor has already done in some way
    though? In which case don't go there.
