  body: "Hi Luka, the conversation has (only slightly) already begun <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/20889\">over
    here</a>. And yes, ATypI is being held in Lisbon this year. To read more about
    this year's conference you can <a href=\"http://atypi.org/06_Lisbon/\">go here</a>.
    \r\n\r\nWhere TypeCon does pre-conference workshops, ATypI does the TechForum.
    The sessions for the TechForum should be posted within the next week. *fingers
    crossed*"
