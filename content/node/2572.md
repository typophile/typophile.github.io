body: Hello folks, this is my second attempt, think I have wasted that post with a
  blink of an eye, as I though I have already posted. <BR> <BR>anyway, I am having
  difficulty identifying this typeface, I know it is very similar to franklin gothic
  heavy italic, but I have put them next to each other and perceive some differences,
  for instance this is more wide and squeezed and also the t is seems more rounded,
  regarding the tail. <BR> <BR>I really welcome any comments and please help me identify
  this font. <BR> <BR>thanks in advance. <BR>ilteris <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23298.gif"

    not be an exact match. It might also be some thinner variant with some applied
    stroking, but I&#39;d have to test my theory.'

  body: I think they just customized the top of the &#34;t&#34;s on on  <BR>a very
    black oblique Helvetica. The &#34;r&#34; and the typical  <BR>curve at the bottom
    of the &#34;t&#34; gives it away. Problem is  <BR>I can&#39;t find the exact match
    neither! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"

  body: well honestly, I can believe it because, here, people don&#39;t play according
    to the rules, it is a high probability that they transform and spoil it according
    to their needs. <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot for the feedbacks though, univers seems
    quite similar to it, I am gonna go for that one. <BR> <BR>cheerz. <BR>ilteris

  body: My guess is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frutiger/95-ultra-black/testdrive.html?s=toronto&amp;p=48">
    Frutiger Ultra</a>, mechanically slanted.
