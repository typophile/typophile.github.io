body: "With multiple languages at work, input of diacritical letters by keyboard happens
  to be quite problematic. Dozens of quirky key combinations of your native layout,
  still giving you not even a fraction of all the diacritical variety, or switching
  from language to language for specific input, each defined without single, predictable
  manner.\r\n\r\nTrying to deal with this mess, I once made a keyboard with a single
  and intuitive method for possibly all diacritical letters. The method is simply
  the Option key\_+\_the base letter, followed by typing diacritic's name. Therefore
  pressing, say, Opt\_+\_e, followed by typing <em>acute</em> spits an\_<em>\xE9</em>.
  There's also no need to type the entire name, since the keyboard estimates it and
  suggests early available output. You can get the layout and view more info at http://github.com/ichosis/Interdiacritical/.\r\n\r\nTypographers,
  linguists and editors \u2014 all the people who are dealing with diacritics in their
  daily work \u2014 would, I think, find the keyboard useful. Especially touch-typists
  used to type with uninterrupted flow, what the method inherently allows. But I'd
  rather hear what do you guys think."

  body: The Swedish standard keyboard has five combinatory diacritics - acute and
    grave accents, circumflex, tilde and umlaut - mapped out on two buttons of the
    keyboard. You press the button (or the button and shift/button and alt gr, yes
    mine is a pc) and then the letter, getting you a good portion of the needed glyphs.
    Wouldn't a system like that but with a greatly extended range of diacritics be
    more efficient?

  body: "But system you're describing, Johan \u2014 and, in fact, system of all those
    standard keyboards \u2014 is exactly what I was trying to avoid, as it forces
    you to be aware of a bunch of things:\r\n\u2022 What modifier keys are required?
    Shift? Alt/Opt? Both?\r\n\u2022 What keys trigger what diacritics? Apostrophe
    gives acute or grave? Colon as umlaut? What about others, less intuitive ones?
    And, hey, it's still punctuation, not diacritics!\r\n\u2022 What is the actual
    combination? In other words, what modifiers in what combination with what other
    keys give what diacritics? You see the problem.\r\n\r\nEarly on, I've tried a
    system based simply on Option key plus a key of diacritic's initial letter, followed
    by the base letter. But it just couldn't work with caron, cedilla, circumflex
    and so on. I'd have to make some hacks, therefore no solution either.\r\n\r\nWhat
    makes the Interdiacritical method effective is its ridiculous simplicity, intuitiveness
    and extensibility: with a single Opt key you can enter basically all imaginable
    diacritics above all Latin letters, knowing only the diacritic's name. And with
    multiple languages to deal with efficiency is not a priority \u2014 that's what
    language-specific keyboards are for."

    accent, but they're not so many. \r\nHowever I have to point some incoherences
    as, for instance, \"\xE5\" letter is the direct result of cmd+<em>a</em>, while
    \"\xE0\" is cmd+<em>`</em> + <em>a</em> \r\n\r\nTo access the complete latin accents,

  body: "I work mostly in three different languages (dutch, german english) on a dutch
    keyboard, which works fine most of the time. The only difficulty I have is when
    I write long german texts, as the accents and characters commonly used (\xE4,\xFC,\xF6,\xDF)
    are not, as on a german keyboard, directly accessible, but only through the pattern
    alt+u+a/o/u and alt+s. This becomes even more of a hassle when using it on capitalized
    letters, which are common in german because every noun is capitalized. So typing
    \xC4 requires the combination alt+u, shift+a. This can become a little annoying
    over time... \r\n\r\nAnd I guess languages that use more diacritics, and more
    complicated ones (like stacked diacritics) can be even more difficult to write.
    So I guess there definately is a need to simplify this, but I'm not sure this
    will work over longer texts as it still requires quite a lot of extra typing.
    So when using multiple languages at the same time, I would prefer programming
    new key combinations with only single keys (like the ones mentioned above). When
    only using the diacritic in a few words I probably would go through the glyphs
    panel.  "

  body: "I use Windows and expanded my keyboard adding AltGr + key combinations for
    most letters with diacritics. This could be done with a free keyboard editor from
    Microsoft.\r\n\r\nOne can add characters to AltGr + A-9 and Shift + AltGr + A-9.
    Thus, the possibilities are quite wide (49 x 2 in a Portuguese keyboard). The
    only problem are conflicts with keyboard shortcuts in some programs, as InDesign
    or Photoshop, so it's up to the user to select keys for one and other functions.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know if this is possible in Mac. As there is no AltGr key, Grzegorz solution
    may be the better choice in this platform.\r\n\r\nWhat about to use stylistic
    sets to achieve this? Say, in a <code>ssXX</code> feature one can add the same
    substitutions set on <code>ccmp</code> feature, but then using combinations like
    letter + diacritic abbreviation + trigger. Something like <em>a/ac=</em> subs
    by <em>aacute</em> (this is just a sample, not the correct syntax). Is this a
    very unorthodox idea?"

    went into various names, as there's no limit for that. You just type the name
    you're familiar with and the diacritic pops out. For now they're mostly Unicode
    names and some of their widely recognizable equivalents. Still flattened to plain
    Latin, though.

  body: "I've experimented with various input methods some years ago. For longer texts
    anything beyond two keystrokes per accented letter gets tedious. It's not only
    the number of keystrokes that grows but also the <em>typing time per keystroke</em>.
    It seems that one can do at most two keystrokes unconsciously \u2014 if the keystroke
    sequence is longer, the brain starts task switching: one stops thinking about
    the text, one starts thinking about the required key sequence, one finishes the
    key sequence, and finally continues thinking about the text.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    accessing every accented letter with two keystrokes does not work (unless one
    uses a keyboard with thirty dead keys). But one can access the most frequent ones
    with two keystrokes, and that's what counts in practice. Here's the recipe: Take
    one key as a reserved &lt;Accent&gt; key (I prefer &lt;Tab&gt;, but that's a matter
    of choice). Typing &lt;Accent&gt; replaces the letter before the cursor by another
    one: <em>a</em> becomes <em>\xE4</em>, <em>A</em> becomes <em>\xC4</em>, <em>e</em>
    becomes <em>\xE9</em>, <em>s</em> becomes <em>\xDF</em>. To get other letters
    with the same base letter, type &lt;Accent&gt; repeatedly. Every press of the
    &lt;Accent&gt; key yields one more replacement: <em>\xE4</em> becomes <em>\xE0</em>,
    <em>\xE0</em> becomes <em>\xE1</em>, <em>\xE1</em> becomes <em>\xE5</em>, and
    so on.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I can get the frequent letters (in a given language)
    with keystroke sequences that are both mnemonic and short (the average length
    of the keystroke sequences is very close to 2). For rare letters occurring in
    some foreign proper name, I may have to type &lt;Accent&gt; ten times, but for
    letters that I need only once per month, that doesn't matter. The only thing I
    have to remember is the rule \"type the base letter and then type &lt;Accent&gt;
    sufficiently often until the required letter appears\". The method also has the
    advantage that one can type in the natural (handwriting) order: first the base
    letter, then the accent. And in contrast to dead keys, one needs only one reserved
    &lt;Accent&gt; key. (Conveniently located keys are a scarce good!)\r\n\r\nI've
    checked the orthographies of 28 European languages. For 21 of them, everything
    works smoothly, for the remaining 7, it works with some tweaking. <a href=\"http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~uwe/paper/AccInput-bibl.html\">(Here's
    the full story.)</a> Still there are some limitations:\r\n\r\nThe method clearly
    does not work if the number of accented letters per base letter is too large (such
    as the 17 variants of <em>o</em> in Vietnamese or the 23 variant of <em>alpha</em>
    in polytonic Greek). Even five derived letters (e.g. in Yoruba) may be too much.\r\nIf
    one switches between different languages, one has to switch the replacement scheme.
    Typing French text with a replacement scheme for German is a sure way to give
    you RSI.\r\nUnlike dead key or AltGr techniques, the method requires support by
    the application. It's an <em>input method</em>, not a <em>keyboard</em>. (In fact,
    I have only implemented it as an editor macro.)\r\n"

    is how OS X Lion somehow deals with it? Hold-pressing a base letter gives you
    a little pop-up with a row of few related diacritics, all with associated numeral
    as a shortcut. By the way, this row is also tab-enumerable, what quite closely
    resembles Uwe\u2019s very own idea."
