  have no fill, and are made of line only.\r\n\r\nIt's for a video project where i
  want to 'write' the text on in neon light. I can get a filter to do this in AfterEffects
  but need type that's more-or-less continuous (handwriting/script) and is 'stroke-only'.\r\n\r\nany
  ideas?\r\n\r\nthanx in advance.\r\nVV"

    made a line-font a while back that does have a lot of extra symbols & accents,

    fot the Illustrator question, you can make a centre stroke with the blend tool,

  body: "You might have to adjust a few lines before you can use it. If you want to
    make center lines from a font, you'll have to copy the letters, erase everything
    but one outer stroke, paste it, erase everything but the other outer stroke (this
    is where you might have to do some adjusting like linking to separate parts from
    one stroke to make sure you get the 2 outer strokes) & thenuse the blend tool
    (set it to one step).\r\nThe copy/paste thing is needed because you can't use
    the blend tool on a single object & even if you cut a path, Illustrator will still
    see it as one object."
