body: "I'm still waiting for MyFonts to release this font, but I thought I'd post
  a couple of examples here to give a peek at what's new.\r\n\r\nThis is a four font
  Script family called Waterfall with a Professional OpenType version that includes
  all four fonts, plus alternates and ligatures not found in the primary styles.\r\n\r\nI'm
  interested in what folks think.\r\n\r\nRob"
