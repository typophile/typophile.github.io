  or Avenir with the line treatment used to create Prisma?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Prisma_Gotham_6643.jpg]

  body: With careful use of the convert type to outlines, clone and expand stroke
    functions, repeated, you can apply that effect to any font. It will naturally
    work better with some than others.

  body: Hehe. Nice one Stephen;-) We can only hope that someone like TFJ would take
    on such a project but in the meantime anyone?? What bugs me is I've seen it before
    and can't remember where. But it is out there!

  body: 'Funny that you bring up that font, Conor, as I was always looking for neon-like
    lettering when I was about twelve, thirteen years old (I''m eighteen right now),
    and I ran across this one as well. I didn''t like it then, don''t like it now,
    although the concept of making letters out of such ''connected'' shapes has been
    executed some times before, and done with great grace. '

  body: Hi Conor. The shape of NeonCaps is very close. To bad it is so badly drawn.
    Let me know if you find it in a better version. Thanks for the effort so far.
    I was and still am hoping I don't have to draw it from scratch myself;-) Please
    TFJ where are you when we need you;-)

    is a very nice one for you to check out Sebastiaan. Do you have any other examples
    of stuff like this done with grace?
