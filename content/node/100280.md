body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI thought some of you might be interested in my Flickr site which
  has a pretty good collection of 'Random signs and bits of type seen whilst I walk
  around aimlessly'. Not big branded stuff that we all know, more the homemade/sign-writer/weathered-and-looks-unusual
  kinda thing.\r\n\r\nI'm sure I'm not the only one to record type-in-action that's
  interesting, so if anyone else has something similar, feel free to share!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/46913941@N02/\r\n"
