    Do you think they modified the spurs of the DIN? The only reason would be that
    this modifitcation of the spurs would make it easier to differ letters that have

    could also do your own detective work and try to teach us (me at least) what is
    legal and what is not. I don't have your knowledge or skills (that's why I only
    participate here, posting elsewhere would be irrelevant, senseless and probably
    stupid) but I'm a font lover. My quest (my obsession I should say) is to know
    them all :) And I try, as much I can (know) not to recommend what I suspect to
    be illegal or outline theft. But you'll have to admit that the font world is quite
    nebulous, dark and blurry where the big ones are probably the biggest thieves
    (cf previous discussion on Triplett). Reliable information is also very hard to
    find.\r\n<blockquote>\r\nTitillium is born inside the Accademia di Belle Arti
    di Urbino as a didactic project Course Type design of the Master of Visual Design
    Campi Visivi.\r\nThe aim of the project is the creation of a collective fonts
    released under OFL. Each academic year, a dozen students work on the project,
    developing it further and solving problems. Any type designer interested in the
    amendment or revision of Titillium is invited to co-operate with us, or develop
    their own variants of the typeface according to the terms specified in the Open
    Font license. We also ask all graphic designers who use Titillium in their projects
    to email us some examples of the typeface family in use, in order to prepare a
    case histories database.\r\nThree years after the birth of Titillium, the project
    is still evolving, and even we don\u2019t know what it will become in the future.\r\nSpecial
    thanks go to:\r\nProf. Luciano Perondi, design and curation\r\nProf. Marcello
    Signorile, coordination\r\nProf. Manuel Zanettin, web project supervision\r\nDiego
    Giusti, design of the first prototype\r\n</blockquote>\r\n"

  body: "Mostly I'm trying to raise red flags, for people who really care about type
    (very rarely the person asking for the ID, I'm sad to say) to think twice. Specifically
    I'm hoping that the handful of people who spend so much time IDing fonts do care
    about type, and Typophile, more than they care about merely getting their kicks.
    This is a community, and every action helps or hinders its long-term health. I've
    been warning about the dangers of IDing <em>for its own sake</em> for many years,
    and I believe it's one reason Typophile isn't as vital as it used to be. Type
    designers give this place its reason to exist, but type designers are being increasingly
    disrespected. You can't sustain such an environment - all you'll end up with is
    a vapid ID swamp. We have to be more mindful, more like parents and less like
    children.\r\n\r\nLook at Fivos's first post. What would somebody like Julia do
    except click on that link, then click on the Dafont link, and download the font,
    with no idea whether it's ethical or not? And what could somebody like me do except
    follow that same path, get suspicious (who's \"piqtogram\", and how come his one
    font on Dafont has a very nice Latin and a horrible Thai?), then try putting \"Thaitillium\"
    into Google, getting a full page of links to a free font, and say \"this smells
    plagiarized\"? Neither the person asking for an ID, nor a person like me who can
    detect potential copying but isn't an ID expert, can be expected to know that
    Thaitillium is a derivation of Titillium, which just happens to be a legitimate
    libre design. (BTW, my question concerning Chantabut's copyright claim still stands...)\r\n\r\nYour
    description of the font world as \"nebulous, dark and blurry\" is apt, and everybody
    falls into a trap sometimes. I myself prefer raising too many red flags than too
    few, because I'm willing to be wrong sometimes in order to reduce harm to things
    I value. But together we can greatly reduce the rampant disrespect for designers:
    we cover each other's blind spots, reducing the cases where we recommend an unethical
    (BTW not <em>illegal</em> - I personally don't care much for the letter of the
    law) font, changing our recommendations when a fellow Typophile reveals something
    we didn't know.\r\n\r\nYou have impressive knowledge when it comes to IDing type.
    But such knowledge is just a tool - it remains up to the individual to use his
    tools well or poorly, to use his tools to really help the people who deserve it
    most (the people truly dedicated to making the fonts you so enjoy IDing), versus
    merely reveling in his skills. I actually think that you, Dick, Jan and the rest
    usually do a great job; I would simply ask that when somebody with a good \"nose\"
    raises a red flag, don't get upset - just re-evaluate your font recommendations.
    And sometimes you'll find yourself able to hold your ground, effectively lowering
    that red flag.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>the big ones are probably the biggest thieves</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    don't believe so, even though I'm no fan of Capitalism. And I think many people
    often invent or exaggerate corporate greed in order to feel better about themselves,
    in order to keep pretending that they're not causing harm themselves.\r\n\r\nThe
    Triplett thread is a very good example: just because a large company is taking
    advantage of a designer does not make it OK for a hobbyist to also take advantage
    of the designer. Is paying one shady character worse than <em>not</em> paying
    another shady character? Consider that the former also happens to be nurturing
    the type scene overall (by promoting many more ethical designs than unethical
    ones) while the latter is only harming it (by making it seem like fonts are supposed
    to be free). I would rather pay the party that's doing more good than harm. But
    maybe the best advice in cases like that is: simply don't recommend or use Triplett.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
