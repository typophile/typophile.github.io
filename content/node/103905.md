  for my images. Someone I really look up to is Garance Dor\xE9, I know she writes
  all her fonts herself (does anybody know how to do that by the way? I would like
  to try it.. her website is www.garancedore.com if you would like to see). But is
  there a font that resembles to her handwriting?\r\n<IMG>http://www.garancedore.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/24-7.jpg</IMG>\r\n\r\nI
  am not sure if this post will insert the picture with the handwriting on it, if
  not, this is the link to the image: http://www.garancedore.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/24-7.jpg\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"

    handwriting and if your handwriting is as bad as mine, you're not out of the woods
