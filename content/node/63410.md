  the design professionals. It needs to evoke feelings of trust, reliability and maturity
  while still being approachable, friendly and modern.\r\n\r\nThis is an early iteration,
  and I have converged to the following set of typefaces:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/certtime_4129.png]\r\n\r\nMy
  top choice by a <em>very</em> slim margin is Titilium italic. I also really like
  the r-t pairing in Sansation, specifically the shape of the 't', and I am considering
  building it into the Titilium version.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I am looking at using
  NeoTech italic, but borrowing 'r' from NeoSans.\r\n\r\nThoughts ?\r\n"

  body: The rt pair in Mentone is troublesome. Especially if this is for a brand where
    you know you will always have that pair. Sandsation and Neotech both solve this
    pair better. If you use any of the others you need to reconsider that pair and
    the spacing, etc.

  body: "You could fashion the double \u2018t\u2019 into a ligature and thus eschew
    letterspacing. It's kind of begging for it in the lowercase version, I feel. Doing
    this would have the fortuitous side-effect of making the logotype more memorable,
    perhaps even lending a layer of meaning \u2014 in the \u2018lock\u2019 that would
    be created between \u2018cert\u2019 and \u2018time\u2019. You could even include
    the \u2018r' in the ligature if you felt adventurous. \r\n\r\nIf you do attempt
    this, don't just smash the letters into each other, but rather intervene in the
    letterforms and extend the right arm of the first \u2018t\u2019 \u2014 and be
    vewy vewy careful with the \u2018r\u2019, should it be involved.\r\n\r\nThat said
    ( in defense of a capitalized version ) may it be useful to have that uppercase
    \u2018T\u2019 in order to point out that there are two  of them? It may serve
    as a nifty mnemonic for the correct spelling of the inevitable website.\r\n"

  body: "@CGI - thanks for the suggestion, I gave the ligature idea a try. Merging
    t's by extending of left t's arm to the right looks not terribly interesting,
    but it does show some promise. I see two problems with this option though. First
    is that the ligature falls apart and looks quite odd if each t uses its own color.
    I guess I can do a gradient, but that's a path leading to the cheesy side :) Second
    issue is that the wordmark starts to look a bit busy (or fancy) and I really need
    it to have a fairly restrained and understated appearance.\r\n\r\n@all - I was
    also pointed out that tighter kerning and alternative shape of 'r' are worth looking
    at. The kerning suggestion is 100% spot on, applied. With the 'r' there are options:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/certtime-r-500px_6015.png]\r\n\r\n1.
    untouched 'r'\r\n2. 'r' based on 'm'\r\n3. 'r' based on 'e', take 1\r\n4. 'r'
    based on 'e', take 2\r\n\r\nI am definitely not liking #1 anymore. The #2 is more
    consistent, but #3/4 look more pleasant. Thoughts ?\r\n\r\n"

    [[http://www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/effra/|Effra]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/etelka/|Etelka]]
