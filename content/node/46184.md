  (tipped into an 1853 magazine), shows a gamut of working styles in the multi-face
  genre of advertisement that originated in the title pages of books. Blackletter,
  script, outline, dimensional and decorative styles were also available, but not
  used in this piece, which represents the basic \"look\" of advertising typography
  for much of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nSans serif faces came into common usage in
  the 1830s, but with the exception of the odd bold condensed display face, these
  were all-cap designs, and the idea and practice of using lower case sans serif fonts
  did not emerge until the 1890s.\r\n\r\nWhy did it take so long?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    featuring one little usage of a very similar sans in 1816 (first image in column).\r\n\r\nI'd
    tend to agree with James. It most likely looked so odd, that nobody immediately
    saw it for what it was. It really is more interesting that it's so close to helvetica
    and avenir, and other sans that are considered cutting-edge (gotham)."

    (the wider proportions of which they resemble). I guess James might be right -
    if you're bringing them in for emphasis, you might feel no need for a less emphatic
    way to set them.\r\n\r\nDid the slab-serif lowercase emerge contemporaneously
    with the uppercase?"

  body: "Another factor may have been that it is harder to see what to do with the
    lower case and a mono-line look. \r\n\r\nWith the upper case, the joins in DPBR
    are at right angles to the stems, whereas in the lower case many, bdghmnpq, are
    at a steeper angle. And you have to narrow them more at the joins, like in a serif
    font, for them not to look clotted. But that compromises the mono-line look to
    some extent. \r\n\r\nThat doesn't answer the question of why they felt they needed
    a lower case, though.   "

  body: "For what it\u2019s worth, this is my take on the topic. If, as I think, the
    sanserif letter of the late 18th and early 19th centuries was based first on Roman
    capitals of the Republican period \u2013 up to the first century BCE \u2013 which
    are monoline letters with hardly any noticeable serifs and no thick and thin strokes
    \u2013 and then on earlier Greek capitals, then our lower case letters did not
    exist at that period and it would have been illogical to add them to sanserif
    letters of any kind. During the 19th century, quite a lot of display typography
    using sanserif types, in books at any rate, seems, whether consciously or not,
    to have a sort of echo of the form of the Roman inscription, and is set all in
    caps.\r\n\r\nWhen typefounders began to think that the strange new \u2018Egyptian\u2019
    (sanserif) design was worth developing (as we know it was already used by signwriters
    and letter cutters and lithographers and engravers), that argument did not hold
    out for very long. So you get Thorowgood\u2019s well-known Grotesque round about
    1830, which has condensed proportions and a lower case, and does not look remotely
    like the letters of a Roman or a Greek inscription. And then gradually lower case
    characters begin to be provided for some sanserif types. My impression is that
    these happen first, or at any rate more frequently, in Germany, round about 1850.\r\n\r\nBut
    of course anyone could have made a sanserif lower case. In 1810 William Gell published
    a book about his exploration of antiquities in Greece, and drew this quite nice
    title page for it using sanserif capitals. He would have been familiar with early
    Greek monoline inscriptional lettering.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gell
    - Itinerary 1810 - 1 title tr a 450_3689.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd this is an engraving
    of a detail of one of the maps he drew for the book. The sanserif lower case must
    simply have seemed a sensible addition.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gell
    - Itinerary 1810 - 2 lower case - 500_4360.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf there is an earlier
    sanserif lower case in print than this, of 1810, I have yet to hear of it. (Note
    that I said in print. During the 18th century there were monoline types with a
    lower case for impressing lettering in relief for blind people to read.)\r\n"

    thread]] there is a picture of the Thorowgood sans. The lower case is rather awkward.
    Is the story of greater use of lower case sans a matter of gradual improvement
    in the design of the lower case sans letters, which, when they were better, started
    to be used more often?"

    in the design of the lower case sans letters, which, when they were better, started
    to be used more often?</em>\r\n\r\nYes Bill, I think there\u2019s a lot in that.
    The sans was so strange that it was not easy how to figure out a lower case for
    it \u2013 whereas the slab serifs, which just seemed to be rather crude roman
    types, soon had lower case in roman and italic.\r\n\r\nI dived into this without
    much preparation, but here to justify my remarks about the German sans is one
    from the foundry of F. W. Bauer in Frankfurt am Main (not, I think, any relation
    to Johann Christian Bauer, whose firm became the Bauer\u2019sche Gie\xDFerei in
    Frankfurt), from the technical publication <em>Journal f\xFCr Buchdruckerkunst</em>,
    1858. The size is 14 Didot points. Seems pretty competent to me.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bauer
    - Mittel Grotesk - 1858 - 500_4102.jpg]\r\n\r\nEnglish founders do seem to have
    woken up to the idea much later. Here is a sans from the Caslon foundry in London,
    from their house journal, <em>The Caslon Circular</em> for October 1878. The size
    is 2-line English or about 28 point. They introduce it with the note, \u2018Many
    have been the applications we have received for the Doric\u2014or Sans-serif\u2014
    lowercase, and we have been induced to commence the series so as to supply the
    want thus indicated.\u2019 In other words we are making a lower case for this
    font because our customers keep asking for it, not because we want to. They say,
    without enthusiasm, that it has \u2018the quality of plainness\u2019, and that
    it can\u2019t help being \u2018a good wearing letter\u2019. What one might call
    low-key marketing.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Caslon - Doric 2E
    lowercase - 500_3846.jpg]\r\n\r\nMore early German examples would be welcome \u2013
    but not that notorious and much-reproduced condensed sans of \u20181825\u2019,
    which I hope is now thoroughly discredited.\r\n"

    keep asking for it, not because we want to...</em>\r\n\r\nIt seems paradoxical
    that the sans was more developed in blackletter-using Germany than the UK.\r\nBut
    perhaps German type culture had less prejudices about what was appropriate for
    the foreign and already strange-seeming roman letter (as Paul Renner would later
    demonstrate with Futura).\r\n\r\nAnother explanation is suggested in Fred Smeijers'
    <em>Counterpunch</em>--that by the 19th century type founding had become an industrial
    institution with clearly demarcated job functions which separated concept and
    execution, the conceptualizers being marketers, not designers or makers. But why
    did the marketers not respond to the market's \"applications\" for a sans lower
    case? Because it was beneath the diginity of type founders?--They were men of
    rank, many being engaged in public affairs. James Figgins I, for instance, was
    an Alderman while directing the Figgins foundry, only retiring from the business
    when he became an MP in 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    sans you put up. I'm wondering whether this was a German practice, based on the
    black letter style of g. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the one story g is easier to make work
    in a monoline look, as you have three horigonals, instead of the four in the double
    story g. \r\n\r\nAnd the need for a more forced double story g may have influenced
    the more quirky look of the English Grotesques. That German 'Mittel Grotesque'
    already has a more even, sober look than the English example. "
