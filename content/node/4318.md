body: Hello <BR> <BR>i am preparing a broshure where i use 3 colors. Propably it will
  be 158 CV &#40;orange&#41;, 539 CV &#40;Dark Blue&#41; and the metallic silver 877.
  I want to make compinations with those colors and also to use the silver 877 in
  tints to get tones in a picture.  <BR> <BR>I would appreciate it if you could give
  me any tips about printing metallic colors. <BR> <BR>christos

  body: Christos, <BR> <BR>The Pantone web site has some very good information on
    metallic  colours used in printing. Follow the links on this page.  <BR><a href="http://www.pantone.com/products/products.asp?idSubArea=0&amp;idArea=1&amp;idProduct=316&amp;idArticleType_Products=0&amp;ShowNav=23"

    <BR> <BR>You should also talk to your printer about what you want to do. <BR>

  body: 1. If you have large solid areas, always add a varnish -- metallics pick up
    fingermarks far more easily. &#40;Think of  aluminum fridge doors..&#41; <BR>
    <BR>2. Type knocked out of a metallic works far better than surprinting &#40;in
    other words, the reader&#39;s situation is usually with the metallic reflecting
    a darker part of their environment, so metallics appear dark in usage&#41;. In
    particular, surprinting fine black type on a solid metallic is a bad idea, as
    it doesn &#34;sit&#34; very well on the surface. <BR> <BR>3. Always use coated
    stock -- uncoated can look ghastly. <BR> <BR>4. Straight silver can look a little
    uneven &#40;it tends to pick up the slightest unevenness in the paper stock&#41;
    -- splurge on the &#34;mixed metallics&#34; pantone book, and try some subtler
    effects -- more like &#34;pewter&#34;.

  body: Weight and quality of paperstock is criticial when using metallics. <BR> <BR>You
    need to be aware that metallics have a greater degree of opacity than standard
    inks. As a result, on lightweight or low-grade paper stocks the will tend to show
    through on the reverse side of the paper or even bleed through the paper itself.
    <BR> <BR>Your printer will generally advise on the minimum grade of paperstock
    you should be using.

    <BR> <BR>I think this is not as clear cut as it might seem. If you choose the
    right uncoated stock, you can mute the reflective quality for a more subtle effect
    &#40;I&#39;ve done this&#41;. However, for what you want to do, I&#39;d agree
    with Nick.'
