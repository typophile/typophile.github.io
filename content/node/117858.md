  body: Looks totally hand-done to me but if you still need a geometric sans to base
    your customization on, have a look to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic|Avant-Garde
    Gothic]] ITC and particularly to one of its alternative ligature glyphs available
    through OpenType features /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/std-book/glyphs.html#glyphs/540757/326|CA]].
    Your sample /C looks pretty much the same.
