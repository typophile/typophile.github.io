body: Hi <BR>I got a little problem as i don&#39;t really know which encoding i should
  use when generating the font. I&#39;m on a Mac, so i choose Mac Os Roman, however
  when using the typeface in Textedit, the characters match my keys, trying in Illustrator
  they don&#39;t. <BR>So how do i choose the right encoding? <BR>And a second question,
  how do i add special caracters like pictos to my font? Srry, i&#39;m a student and
  initiating in Fontlab so thanks for any help.

  body: MacOS Roman is OK. But perhaps you haven&#39;t provided characters with right
    names. Use the Glyph-&#62;Glyph Names-&#62;Generate Names command to generate
    names from Unicode indexes. <BR> <BR>Johnych
