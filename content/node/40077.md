body: "Well... I am formatting a book, and despite showing him a couple of options,
  my dad still wants to use a sans serif font. I posted here last week and got some
  good suggestions for serif fonts, but it looks like I won't get to use them.\r\n\r\nI'm
  a bit nervous about this since it goes against traditional book typesetting wisdom,
  and also because sans serif can be very modern and sometimes \"cute\", which wouldn't
  really fit with the subject material of this non-fiction book.\r\n\r\nSo, what I
  am looking for is suggestions for:\r\n\r\nSans serif fonts that are classy looking
  and would look nice in large amounts of text\r\nOR (this next one is in case I can
  compromise with him)\r\nSerif font, but that is not very complex and uses minimal
  serifs (something he will look at and think looks very readable- his idea of readable
  is basically sans serif).\r\n\r\nThanks for any help."

    a lot of work in Pill Gothic lately, and that one works out pretty well, and gives
    a look thats very contemporary as opposed to modern."

    about Weiss? Is is a serif font, but the serifs are small. An elegant typeface
    and good for books. Needs generous leading.\r\n\r\nhttp://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFont&code=WSSQ10005000"

  body: You might want to shoot me for saying this, and that's okay, but what about
    Helvetica Neue? It might be hard to read at first, but after a while it is actually
    very easy to read, if it is set properly. Philip Meggs' _A History of Graphic
    Design_ is set entirely in Helvetica. At first I didn't like that, but then it
    grew on me, and it actually became easy to read.

  body: Just the first  edition of Meggs was set that way, second went back to serifs.
    That said - Helvetica is not bad for text, I also like text set in Gill Sans or
    Hypatia Sans (waiting for italic for Hypatia which will make it even better and
    more useful for text)

  body: "As was brought out in the last thread, the text in this book isn't the most
    important thing.\r\n\r\nThat alone takes you outside \"traditional,\" at least,
    if you consider the first 450 years \"more important\" to \"tradition\" than the
    last 50 years.\r\n\r\nAny number of photography books use a sans. If you ask on
    this forum, you'll get a range of suggestions. As you pour over the suggestions,
    consider this.\r\n\r\nThe designer Richard Eckersley, in his last 10-15 years,
    was quite fond of Trinite, and used it for many books. His good friend Rich Hendel
    (another designer, author of <cite>On Book Design</cite>) loved the look of Richard's
    designs with Trinite, but could never get it to work in his own designs. For a
    similar look, he'd probably use Quadraat. This isn't all that uncommon a phenomena.
    Rich Hendel uses Arnhem quite often, and I've set many books in Arnhem that Rich
    designed -- you would think I understand it by now. But when I have to design
    a book, I can't get Arnhem to work quite right, even if I steal Rich's design
    pretty much in full. When Arnhem would be right but I have to do the design, I
    usually switch to something like Charter.\r\n\r\nWhat matters in a book, whether
    the text is important or not, is that the book is a physical object. There are
    spacial relationships you have to attend to. They are there whether you take a
    traditional approach or   not. The \"right\" typeface is one you develope some
    comfort in working with. Think on it -- there is no magical typeface. If there
    were one, we'd all use it. The magic comes from your ability to understand how
    it works (fits spatially), and use it.\r\n\r\nIf you've never heard of Richard
    Eckersley or Rich Hendel it doesn't really matter; the point is they were/are
    very, very good book designers, who worked enough years to see many changes in
    both fashion and technologies. "

  body: Avenir is not a bad idea either. In checking I found that Lewis Blackwell
    set his book "20th Century Type" (1992 Rizzoli, NY) in Gill Sans Light and it
    functions well with the illustrations and type specimens.

  body: Optima. Easier on the eyes over longer stretches of text than any other sans
    serif I've seen. The text may not be so important to your dad, but it may just
    be to anyone actually reading it.
