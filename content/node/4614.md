  body: The packaging to me is less an issue than the icons &#40;I only look at the
    packaging once&#41;.  I can&#39;t tell one icon from another! They are way too
    busy and meaningless to me.  There should have been some kind of clear progression
    from the past versions.  Sometimes just being &#34;pretty&#34; is not enough.
