<p>Today we launch a brief for typographers
all over the world. The brief is:
&ldquo;Communicate with an illustrator&rdquo;.
We need the best typographers in the
world to design a brief for the best
illustrators in the world. Since the
brief has to not only inform but also
inspire illustrators we will settle 
for nothing less than perfect typography.</p>

Pretending it&rsquo;s Evil and it should be verboten is a good tactic if you&rsquo;re an established professional in an affluent society who is mostly interested in making more money (by trying to discourage spec work on the part of others). To be fair though, some people discourage spec work because they -incorrectly- assume it&rsquo;s pure bad for everybody. Humans aren&rsquo;t so simple.</p>

<p>Well yes, that&rsquo;s one way to distinguish professionals from amateurs.</p>
<p>Of course there is self interest involved, but it&rsquo;s cynical to assume it&rsquo;s the only motivation; as you say, humans aren&rsquo;t so simple. The people who organize their professions are volunteers whose bottom line would have been much better if they hadn&rsquo;t spent so much time volunteering. But they do it to raise the status of the profession in general, and part of that is increasing the value of that kind of work in the marketplace, for everyone who does it, not just the professional elite who made the grade and pay their dues. By having a code of ethics that prohibits members from doing spec work, professsional organizations may in fact hamper members from getting work that goes to those prepared to compete with spec.</p>
<p>If professions don&rsquo;t organize, they will be populated by contract workers without benefits &ndash; Bush&rsquo;s &ldquo;entrepreneurs&rdquo; &ndash; who will be exploited by a capitalist marketplace dominated by powerful corporations. Graphic design freelancers are such entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised you would favour capitalism over the worker, Hrant.</p>

<p>Which is totally fine. The problem is hiding that fact, for example by

As if.</p>

<p>But since you brought that up: again, why so absolute? A client could try its luck with spec work, and then go &ldquo;pay-first&rdquo; if needed. Ethical? Maybe not. But this does not make it OK for a designer to be phoney and manipulative, especially not when it comes to his peers; except I guess if he thinks he has no peers.</p>
<p>Whose side am I on? I guess mostly the highly talented designer who
doesn&rsquo;t have the luxuries of time and opportunity that most of us do.

entrenched more entrenched.</p>

<p>If an organization has a code of ethics, the members should abide by it. 
But it&rsquo;s not like professional organizations want to outlaw the behaviour for non-members.
They will point out how it&rsquo;s in the interests of design-buyers to avoid commissioning spec work, because they truly believe that&rsquo;s better for design in general, as well as for professionals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the side of not seing people exploited, irrespective of talent.
I&rsquo;m suspicious of &ldquo;public good&rdquo; projects that ask for volunteer work, such as preparing briefs for illustrators, with pefect typography, because the person asking usually has some kind of grant paying them for their work.</p>
<p>I checked out this Caravan Project web site, and there&rsquo;s nothing about &ldquo;who we are&rdquo;, which sets off the bullshit detector alarm bells. Betcha Big Oil ain&rsquo;t paying to tow the caravan from A to B. Also, I think copyright is a good way to protect intellectual property, so creatives don&rsquo;t end up working for nothing &ndash; so I ain&rsquo;t got no kind words for the we-want-your-best-for-nothing &ldquo;no copyright&rdquo; crew.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t enter competitions these days, because, especially in type design, it&rsquo;s a lot of work and expense preparing specimens, and those who organize the competitions (and print the literature and awards books) get paid for their work; the winners get publicity, funded by the losers.</p>

<p>Well Hrant, your reasons for doing &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; work, if you do any, may be self serving, but don&rsquo;t judge others by your own motives.</p>
<p><em>I think you have “better” reasons.</em></p>
<p>True, I rarely won anything when I did enter competitions, and usually didn&rsquo;t like the stuff that did win! There are a lot of people in the same boat.</p>
<p><em>Yes, advertising is much fairer: all the qualification you need is being rich.</em></p>
<p>At least it&rsquo;s not gambling.
Pay the cost of high-res output and shipping, plus entry fees, and don&rsquo;t make the cut &ndash; total write-off. Do that a few times and it adds up.

The only thing we can tell you
is the truth. TCP is a non-profit
project. Your view of volunteerwork
is very dark and I think its sad since
probably many designers agree with you
after failed specworks and such.</p>
<p>Who we are? We are three graphic designers
from Sweden. We are all freelancers. What more
info do you want about us? Do you want us to
put pictures of ourselfs on the page? Then we
would def be accused of voyerism and we don&rsquo;t
want that since we dont want individual attention.</p>
<p>We will not pay anyone for doing design
that we view on our webpage or show at
an exhibition BUT we want TCP to be an
online and rolling gallery that shows and
bring together all parts of the designculture.</p>
<p>We will not sell other peoples work and
we will not take any profit from other
peoples work. We think galleries, be it
online or rolling, should never charge
designers or people for using it.</p>
<p>TCP might get attention due to other peoples
work but isnt that a good thing? To get more
people involved in ethical and moral issues
surrounding our culture and design today.</p>
<p>TCP is a rolling gallery free for anyone
to use or view. It is supposed to bring
art, design &amp; culture together and back
to the people, not manipulate or fool
designers to do free work.</p>
<p>We can only be honest about this and it&rsquo;s
up to you to believe in our ideas or not.
We just hope that if you dont want or dont
have time to get involved just visit the
website now and then to see how the project
on bringing culture together is going and maybe
you will see that it&rsquo;s for the good of the
designers and the people and not for commercial
matters.</p>
<p>Np-copyright logo was created since we think
everything in our culture today is appropriations
and interpretentions from other peoples work.
We agree with your view that the copyright symbol
is good in its way of protecting creatives but we
also think that those who only copy other peoples
design and call it theirs isnt real designers and
probably won&rsquo;t gain from it in the end.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Fred, I apologize for doubting your motives.
Anarcho-syndicalism, go for it.</p>
<p>My dark view of volunteer work is based on a lot of experience with non-profit groups &ndash; so often the money goes to bureaucrats, and the interests of the organization become compromised by those of the sponsor, in order to keep the organization running. Meanwhile, volunteers are used to do the grunt work. The worst-case scenario is when a non-profit activist group that&rsquo;s been around a while needs to fund a project, but can&rsquo;t pay themselves for the work, however, others may be hired to work on the project. And of course tradesmen, services and materials are also paid for.</p>
<p><em>Do you want us to put pictures of ourselfs on the page?</em></p>
<p>Maybe, but I think as designers you should be able to find some way to discreetly provide reassuring background information and context.</p>
<p><em>We can only be honest about this and it’s up to you to believe in our ideas or not.</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s naive. You really can&rsquo;t expect people to take anything on trust. How is a potential contributor to know whether you intend to publish a book reproducing the typographic briefs, or the illustrations? Good intentions are not enough, people&rsquo;s attitudes can change. What if one of your partners has a change of heart and decides to make some money off the TCP material?</p>
<p><em> the best typographers &hellip; natural selection</em></p>
<p>How can you mix elitism with &ldquo;art for all?&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think that since we never have had any interest
in profit in The Caravan Project we didnt question
how other people would see it. Now I start to see
why people missunderstand our whole message.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>TCP is not a company or sponsored by a company. 
The Caravan Project is a rolling gallery that will
give local artists and designers the chance to show their
work without having to go through the posh and pretentious
galleries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The whole idea with the brief was not to get alot of
spec work. We simply wanted others to be as passionate as
us about our project and instead of just showing our own
work and copyright everything we did we wanted to show as
many talented designers as possible and also try to make
people think about copyright since it nowdays is missused
in many ways through interpretentions almost identical to
the originals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We on TCP wanted to contribute to swedens most cultural
and alternative music festival. We didnt want anyone to
specwork for us. We simply wanted as many motivated creatives
as possible to join in, be it illustrators, typographers, artists
or musicians, and in the end try to get the ones involved attention
through an exhibition in Swedens capital Stockholm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To answer both Nick and Chris about elitism and art for the people I would like to clarify the manifesto since it obviously is missunderstood as it is today.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;A gallery should never forbid an artist to show his/her work&rdquo;
No discrimination shall be allowed be it racial, genderbased, ethical, class etc..</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfinished and weak concepts should not be exhibited&rdquo;
Just because it isnt pretentious and posh it doesnt have to be a unprofessional and less qualitybased gallery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provoking art should never be disallowed as long as the artist can explain why he/she wants to create it&rdquo;
Art and design that are provoking should never be rejected just because it is provoking. The artist or designer must always have
the freedom to provoke. But the artist/designer must have a meaning as for why he/she wants to create the provocation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must always be a general interest in art and design. Today the public tend to avoid the galleries that from the beginning was made for them&rdquo;
What about it? Who can argue against that most galleries today have a strange athmosphere where people are not quite themselves and dont dare to ask or debate the works on the big white walls.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&rsquo;t think the way to get people interested in art is to keep making conceptual art, as I assume you are, Freddeuk, from all the stuff about art as communication, the virtue of provocation, and bad art as the product of &ldquo;unfinished or weak concepts&rdquo;. The problems with conceptual art are that most visual artists are bears of very little brain, so their insights are worthless; that the people don&rsquo;t want to spend their weekends going to see the embodied big ideas of idiots; and that visual art, <em>contra</em> every exhibition catalogue produced in the last forty years, cannot &ldquo;explore&rdquo; &ldquo;issues&rdquo; because it doesn&rsquo;t have the structured semantic opportunities that language has. If you want to end the low-grade elitism of galleries now, direct your bile at conceptual art. Race-gender-class prejudice is hardly a dominant force in the art-world, for God&rsquo;s sake! Attributing all ills to that kind of elitism seems a bit odd after the long purge of elitism has has created this sea of gurk, in which people as obviously incompetent as you expect to be taken seriously as theorists.</div>
