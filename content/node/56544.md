  body: "\r\nhey Ashley,\r\n\r\nI like your approach!\r\n\r\nThe two things that stick
    out to me on first glance are:\r\n\r\n*the circular letters - I wonder if the
    stroke keeps going too far on the inside, making a sort of double-walled letter
    \r\n*the I, T, r, and e seem too geometric for the otherwise playful approach
    and execution.\r\n\r\nOh, also in your real cookie dough, the baselines aren't
    straight, which I actually find somewhat charming. \r\n\r\nlove to see where it
    goes!"

  body: I like the real dough too, I just didn't know if it would work in all situations...

  body: "I also like the dough, but have trouble reading dough in both versions. The
    'd' in the digital version doesn't work for me.\r\n\r\nBy the way: I assume you
    want to use the lettering for headlines. Perhaps you could make a couple of versions
    per letter and just photograph them all instead of using digital lettering. That
    way you could compose them together. The digital version looses its charm.\r\n\r\nGood
    work, dough. ;-)"

  body: "The dough design looks delicious. OK. Sorry. I got carried away.\r\n\r\nI
    really like this concept. Here are my issues with the digital version: \r\n(1)
    I can't decide if it says, \"dough\" or \"hugh.\" \r\n(2) Notice how in the dough
    version the baseline of the letters are curvy and organic? Well, you stripped
    all that out in the digital version, which makes it look decidedly less \"doughy.\"
    \r\n(3) Related to (2), some of the glyphs have lost playfulness with the straight
    baselines as well, particularly the 'd', the 'y' and the 'r'.\r\n\r\nAll that
    said, however, good job with getting your creative inspiration!\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick

  body: the sense of dimension and space in the real dough is lacking in the digital.
    the way the H has to move itself over and around the G, for instance, really makes
    it
