  an A-Z list of brands but the kicker is that the type face for each brand needs
  to be a known type face and the idea is to have as compelling of a brand and type
  face as possible.\r\nI am starting the list with\r\n\r\nA - American Airlines -
  Helvetica\r\n\r\nI have created a google spreadsheet that I am keeping the list
  on and have left the privileges open in case anyone is so inclined to add directly
  to the spread sheet.\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/b2ViK2\r\n"
