  text, i.e. \"NO.357 | L.17\", is set in:\r\n\r\n 1. My best guess is that it is
  Didot. Am I right?\r\n\r\n 2. Irrespective of the answer to the first question,
  what keyword should I be using when searching for typefaces with lines running through
  the strokes of characters as in this sample? I thought \"shaded\" would be a good
  starting point, and it indeed got me some good results. Could you suggest any other
  keywords that will get me typefaces similar to the one used in the image?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n

    guess is Bodoni. \r\n\r\nShaded? There are only a few typefaces that have this..but
    it's not hard to do it yourself in a graphics editing programme. I believe The
    Font Feed has a tutorial.\r\n"

    for the tip, though.\r\n\r\n@Gustav: That's exactly what I was looking for. The
    family includes Turkish glyphs, which renders your help all the more valuable.
    Thanks a lot.\r\n\r\n   "
