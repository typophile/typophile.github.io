body: "Dear typographers &c.,\r\n\r\nI'm working on my first book design, which is
  a dissertation on a subject in (the history of) military science. Although I've
  read my Bringhurst and these forums, I'm having trouble deciding on a typeface.
  The writer himself has only one demand: that the text be legible, which for him
  implies rather heavy/dark. \r\n\r\nHis writing style is somewhat old-fashioned;
  perhaps, a little dry too. Should I support the character of the text with a classy
  but 'boring' Garamond or Minion? Or would it be better, instead, to liven up the
  text with something more modern, exciting and quirky, like Quadraat or Dolly?\r\n\r\nSo,
  do you have any suggestions for a serif typeface that, in order of importance\r\n(1)
  is suitable for setting long text (the book will be about 400 pages in size)\r\n(2)
  has nice small caps for headings and nice italics (which are used quite extensively)\r\n(3)
  has something of a 'military' feel to it (this should, of course, not be overdone)\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance for any help you can give me."

  body: "Stefan, thanks for the suggestions. Delicato, which was already on my shortlist,
    is beautiful not in the 'classic' sense, but in a way of its own-- something like
    that is what I'm looking for. \r\n\r\nGeorge, you mean <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1004/conrad-family.html\">Linotype
    Conrad</a>? Too irregular for body text, in my humble opinion. \r\n\r\nThe period
    covered is, to say the least, not too specific: from 1469 BC up to the Cold War."

    Conrad would indeed be a whimsical choice; Sweynheym and Pannartz were definitely
    among what our great-grandmothers would have called the "splendid primitives"
    of type.

    fonts, considering I've already set up separate character styles for small caps
    and the like, which can easily be switched back and forth between OpenType and
    Postscript variants?\r\n\r\nBulmer I find not adventurous enough. Kepler I like,
    but not so much its commas and quotation marks. Whitman and Walbaum are interesting
    options. \r\n\r\nPataline, <a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=dolly&id2=overview\">Dolly</a>
    (not OpenType, by the way) is one of the fonts I'm considering. I really like
    its lively character, which indeed might work to make the dry text a bit more
    exciting. On the other hand, don't you think Dolly (<a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/download/dolly/pdf/Dolly.pdf\">example
    pdf</a>) is too happy and friendly a typeface for serious subject matter such
    as war and its history?\r\n\r\nI've also come across Slimbach's Warnock. Would
    that be acceptable, keeping in mind the subject of the book? I guess Cronos is
    a good sans companion? "

    typeface. The more I have opportunity to look/play/work at/with it, the more I
    like it. The bonus is that the italic isn't a pansy support to the roman, but
    has that rigid goodness that I love so much."

    on the fonts, but usually more extensive ligatures, kerning between the small
    caps and the roman, the superiors, fractions and the like. Switching to \"expert
    sets\" for some characters often breaks spellchecking. Better language support
    means you're less likely to be in trouble when you discover the Czech name in
    your English text.\r\n\r\nI set a book in Warnock, because I needed the Greek,
    and I was very pleased with it."
