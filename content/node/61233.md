  I have no idea what to buy now--there are so many Pantone products. For a freelance
  print designer, what is the standard set these days? My current set is just the
  solid chips: coated and uncoated.\r\n\r\nAre there any Pantone do-it-all books that
  have the solid chips, as well as CMYK and RGB formula equivalents?\r\n\r\nTIA,\r\nJean"

    as well), but I just got an e-mail from them today about a trade-in program that
    could save you some money:\r\n\r\nGo to pantone.com/chipin\r\n"

  body: "There are sets that offer real value (combining several swatch books at a
    lower cost than the combined total for separate ones). \r\n\r\nIMO the bare minimum
    a designer should own is: \r\nformula guide solid uncoated\r\nsame coated\r\n4-colour
    process guide coated (EURO when in Europe)\r\nsame uncoated\r\n\r\nLess imminent,
    but nice to have: formula guide solid matte\r\n\r\nAnd guess what? There is a
    nice case with all of these PLUS \r\ncolor bridge coated \u2014 which has rgb/html/cmyk
    with cmyk and pms-samples \r\nadded as a bonus.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen

  body: "Definitely a Solid to Process coated. It shows on one side, the solid ink,
    and as CMYK on the other. There is a big difference in some colors printing CMYK
    versus spot color. You might consider getting a uncoated too, cause ink on a uncoated
    paper look much darker & duller, cause the ink soaks into the paper instead of
    laying on top of it. If you want to go all the way, get a metallic book and pastel
    book too. \r\n\r\nIf you're plugged in with a commercial printer you might be
    able to get free ones from them, especially if you send a lot of business their
    way. Get hold of a print salesman, they will do anything for a commission. We
    used to get new books every year until the economy went down the crapper. It's
    recommended (by Pantone) that you get a new book every year, but lets be real...\r\n\r\nThey
    have this new GOE system that Pantone is pushing, but I've not heard of anyone
    yet using it here in the USA. Maybe cause a lot of printers have folded, and printers
    in general, are resistant to change. Maybe cause of the sweatshop mentality of
    management from predigital? You would be surprised how many pothead printers there
    are still out there too, but I'm rambling on..."
