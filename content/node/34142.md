    Perfect;\r\n\r\nhttp://revision3.com/pixelperfect\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd of course Russell
    Brown has a nice collection of Photoshop tips & techniques too;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.russellbrown.com/tips_tech.html\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides
    those, I guess mr.google can recommend tigs of 'the other kind' such as good-tutorials;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.good-tutorials.com/\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustrator
    Techniques dot com is the most recent high quality site for your vector needs;
