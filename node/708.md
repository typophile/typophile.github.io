  body: I doubt it. The title of the thing was the &#34;Underground Enigma&#34;. And,
    of course, the original source is lost to the ages. I can check, though.

  body: I checked. I don&#39;t have an S to give you. The graphic shows all the letters
    that were in the original. I did find out the letters were rub-off transfers.
    <BR> <BR>In the end, I just made a font for these seven letters and passed that
    along. Thanks, though. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
