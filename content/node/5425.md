  my own handwriting font, but I am curious if it actually generates vectors off of
  your scans. <BR> <BR>Even if it doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s pretty interesting.

  body: I remember when it was still in beta and free, but it didn&#39;t look so hot.
    I tried it a couple months ago &#40;no longer beta&#41; and the preview I got
    looked really cool. I used a ballpoint pen and it turned out fine. I haven&#39;t
    paid for it yet, but I will once I finish tweaking the letters in PS.

    designers. Pretty cool, and not as expensive as you&#39;d  <BR>imagine. <BR> <BR>Then
    again, I don&#39;t know if anybody can compete with $9.
