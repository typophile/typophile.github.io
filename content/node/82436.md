  a Hebrew script font to match. I then found Egotrip (Fontbit), and through the evolution
  of the invitation, I'm now looking for a new English script to better match the
  Hebrew.\r\n\r\nI'd like to mimic the strokes in the Hebrew (some thickness variation,
  but thin and smooth; handwriting-based; alternates to make the name unique). I hate
  to say that the overused Zapfino is close, but I won't use it.\r\n\r\n<a href=http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/argentina-lian-types/quijote-sauvage/pro/>
  Quijote Sauvage</a> may be close, but I'm not sure.  I looked through a bunch of
  scripts on MyFonts. As you can see, I only need to set the name.\r\n\r\nAny help
  would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSteve"
