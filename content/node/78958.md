  text that I've got to fit on a 4 or 8 page newsletter, like its going to be folded
  so that it'll have a spine. Anyway I always end up with gaping holes where I've
  ran out of text or have to change the type size to fit all the text in a certain
  area. The person wants to have the images under certain paragraphs so some images
  end up with completely different proportions than others so as they fit.\r\n\r\nSo
  I'm not sure if I should just make a template first and the writer can make the
  content to fit in my space? I'm not a graphic designer but I need to put together
  a eloquent newsletter quickly.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated."

  body: Start with a template. Fitting the design around text will make a real mess.
    Any good editor can fit text to the space available.

  body: "Tell your editor how many words they need to add or cut from each article.
    It may take a few rounds of changes to get it right.\r\n\r\nDon't change the text
    size from article to article, but sometimes you can get away with making a slight
    change to the leading (like maybe 1/2 point) between lines to make an article
    a little shorter or longer. Not ideal technique, but it works. And if your columns
    are rag right (rather than justified) you can change a column's width very slightly
    to adjust the depth a little. But it's better just to let the editor edit the
    article's length.\r\n\r\n\"Filler\" articles (quotes, jokes, or whatever) can
    be used to fill gaps. And callouts can be used to fill space and add visual interest.
