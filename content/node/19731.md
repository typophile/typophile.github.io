body: "Six weeks away from graduation, and I am redoing yet another r\xE9sum\xE9.
  I have really focused a lot on typography through my studies, and am planning on
  furthering my education into grad school. Essentially, I do need this to look good,
  and be typeset well. Below are the specifications and the details about the design.\r\n\r\nSize=
  7.25 x 10.25\r\nTypeface Indetification-\r\nName and Footer= Meridien Roman\r\nAll
  other= Kepler\r\n\r\nMy main concerns are:\r\n1) That the hierarchy is clear, easy
  to follow, and understandable.\r\n2) It has been brought to my attention that I
  have used a category to seperate my \"Technical Qualifications\", where as I have
  not included categories for \"Education\" and \"Experience\" for it would ruin my
  hierarchy. It is my opinion that these two categories are not needed, as the first
  two things on a r\xE9sum\xE9 are typically your education and your previous experience.
  The question of flow is really the one posed, as some seem to feel that this omission
  causes an interruption.\r\n3) I have utilized small caps in the sentence fragements
  where necessary, however, the term \"OSX\" baffles me. Should this be set in standard
  magiscules, or do they cause an interruption in the typography?\r\n4) At this point,
  I have not yet decided how exactly I am going to orient the text block on the page,
  wether it be justified left with a larger right margin, centered, or what have you.
  If you have an opinion on this as well, I am more than open to hearing what you
  have to say. \r\n\r\nI really appreciate any suggestions and criticism, and the
  harsher the better. A dilutted opinion is one less valueable to my goal. Thanks."

  body: "In my opinion, as far as I can gather from a quick glance.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dash
    issues:</strong>\r\nI\u2019d question your use of n-dashes instead of hyphens
    in your body text;\r\nI\u2019d also question your use of n-dashes instead of m-dashes
    in your dates.\r\n\r\nI have neither Meridien nor Kepler. Their respective hyphens
    may be longer than usual (it seems so), nevertheless I\u2019d use m-dashes for
    your dates.\r\n\r\n<strong>Grammar issues:</strong>\r\nI\u2019d question your
    omission of full-stops (periods to the American English folk).\r\nI\u2019d hyphenate
    the words \u201Cprint\u201D and \u201Cbased\u201D to read \u201Cprint-based\u201D.\r\nThings
    are \u201Ccomprised of\u201D other things.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."

  body: "I have always been told that n-dashes are preferred, as opposed to a standard
    hyphen. An m-dash does seem rather obtrusive in length for the use in dates, at
    least with Kepler. I suppose I could just substitute a glyph from one of the condensed
    weights to remedy this however. Perhaps you can recommend a font that has well
    proportioned m and n-dashes that I could view to gain a better understanding of
    just what a well proportioned dash should look like, width wise.\r\n\r\nI also
    avoided periods upon another recommendation. I felt, as others did, that since
    I have avoided using complete senteces, that puntuation was not necessary. Additionally,
    I chose the word \"comprise\" based on the recommendation of Strunk and White.
    Their definition relates that this term literally translates to \"embrace\". I
    don't mind changing the word though, it is really not a big loss either way, although
    I would prefer to correct it so that I position the writing to affect the middle
    80% of the population whom have the average understanding of grammar and spelling.
    This seems to be the best tactic, as the bottom 10% and the top 10% of designers
    are clearly not where I am aiming as of just yet, being not a seasoned designer
    myself.\r\n\r\nThank you for your suggestions, they are appreciated."

  body: Its a little lengthy. Your name can be more prominent. Overall, its nice and
    clean....although it lacks personality. I think you could use a touch of humor
    or quirkiness in there, whether it is textual or graphical. Then again, thats
    where the line between graphic designers and everyone else gets more apparent.

  body: "I feel like there is not enough white space. Its hard to scan your resume.
    I feel like your hoping they will read the whole thing. \r\n\r\n Also, I would
    try to avoid justifying the right margin.  Iam a wrong. Someone prove me wrong.
    Ive been working on my resume lately but I think there are standards you are trying
    to break.  I feel your contact info is tucked at the bottom and hidden. And over
    all the design is to grey.\r\n\r\nDont get me wrong but based on my research this
    is how I feel. You definately are great at typography and iam impressed overall.
    I will post mine if you like. Maybe I should shut up.\r\n"

  body: "No, don't do that mad_grab. I have had some many different r\xE9sum\xE9's
    at this point, so, its not like I don't understand where you are coming from.
    I did not really set out to break any standards, and I typically do prefer to
    set well proportioned, fully justified text than to have ragged, unbalanced lines
    of type. I do do both, but on this occasion, I felt it better to keep it simple,
    the old KISS principle. The lack of character might be bad, but really, I aimed
    at again,  easy readability. I was surprised to hear Prakash Nair comment on the
    length, as its far shorter than any other r\xE9sum\xE9 I have done in the past,
    its not even on a full 8.5 x 11 sheet. Also, I should point out that the character
    comes through the paper based on the stock that I have chosen to print with. I
    ran across it really on accident, its a laid text weight from Neenah, that is
    actually a light blue, you can view a sample <a href=\"http://www.neenahpaper.com/itemlisting/index.asp?ft=Home&s=Laidc&b=05&c=CBL\">here</a>.
    I think that this lends enough character, plus the odd size, to set me apart.
    \r\n\r\nI agreed although about my name and contact info, I will make those items
    more prominent. After all, those are rather important items of information."

  body: the use of adjectives comes from the fact that I don't like to simply use
    the same words over and over again. Is there any other way to go about that, not
    sure.
