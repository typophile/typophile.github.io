Apologies for the low resolution of this image. focus on the upper portion of the logo, thank you.</p>
<p>So here I am having a client for my final output for a course in my university and we agreed on the rebranding of the logo as being like this image up here.</p>
<p>my problem now is what &ldquo;C&rdquo; can be best similar to this? (See the center of the top portion of the logo.)</p>
<ul>
<li>has a ball terminal</li>
<li>more or less constant width throughout the stroke of the &ldquo;C&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I am trying to have the look that the &ldquo;C&rdquo; that will be used in this logo will be the one that will be used for the brand name as well (since it also starts with C; both words to be exact.)</p>
<p>In addition, I&rsquo;d need a second type that will accompany the primary type (for touchpoints and other deliverables)</p>
<p>Any suggestions, opinions or comments about this? Much appreciated and thank you for your time! (in advance of course ^.^ )</p>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>A couple of points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just looking or the C in the logo, then why use a font? This should be easy enough to draw, and the advantages are that you get exactly what you want (what both you and the client envision), you don&rsquo;t have to worry about licensing/usage restrictions, and it costs nothing except your time which you would have to invest anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fonts being free or not should make no difference whether the business is an established, ongoing concern, or with regards to usage. Often the commercial fonts will have fewer restrictions than many free fonts and you can be certain of your and your client&rsquo;s rights. With a commercial font you&rsquo;ll usually get a high quality design which is more likely  to be unique - and a commercial font doesn&rsquo;t need to break the bank. Many excellent fonts to be had for under a tenner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That having been said. It is difficult to suggest a font without knowing anything of the client - the business, the target market, the usage of the logo and other branding material. All of this will inform your choice regarding the mood you wish to convey and the appropriateness of the font.</p>
<p>For the C and brand name style you&rsquo;ve mentioned - a good typewriter font such as ITC American Typewriter, or Esfera from Nick Curtis (only $12.95) will give you the monoline character with ball serif. There are many great examples of complete branding solutions using fonts such as this also, so you may not need to look for a second font. However, if this is a cupcake business (kind of looks like a cupcake in the logo), then American Typewriter is probably a bit overused in this area and you may wish to consider an alternate style to set your client&rsquo;s business apart from the competition.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I see your points and I can agree much with all of what you said.</p>
<p>if anything about the client:</p>
<ul>
<li>rebranding to make the look less of a passion kind of business</li>
<li>cleaner look</li>
<li>yes it&rsquo;s a pastery business, online at that.</li>
<li>target market; younger demographic of people (think university students or people who can come by to get a treat for their loved ones on the go)</li>
<li>uses of logo would be for online and other touchpoints such as packaging, menu, posters</li>
</ul>
<p>as for mood, as my professor suggested, would be more to being a cleaner kind of logo rather than being elegant, simple or &lsquo;elitist&rsquo; (as said by the client)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Clean style or not, I would simply design the C yourself. Reading your post I was already thinking &ldquo;Why would you want a typeface for this?&rdquo; and then I read osamu&rsquo;s post in which he makes a lot of valid points. I personally really wouldn&rsquo;t recommend typewriter typefaces for this brand though. I would design the C myself and possibly select a slab serif typeface to work with the logo for display use and/or body copy. Perhaps [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hoftype/cassia/|Cassia]] by Hoftype? It&rsquo;s not monoline, but I personally think your brand could use a &ldquo;human touch&rdquo;. If you insist on monoline, then [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/archer/overview/|Archer]] by Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones should be a great choice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/archer/overview/">Archer</a>, <a href="http://ernestinefont.com">Ernestine</a> (disclaimer, the latter is mine). Both not free. But then, branding with free typefaces is usually a terrible idea – not just because many of them are not that great, but also because one of the points is to make your brand stand apart – which a typeface available to everyone at the touch of a button doesn’t exactly help. 
In this regard, drawing it yourself is of course the best idea. But since you’ll want it to mesh with your type choice I’d recommend to decide on the type first and then build on that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>well, taking all of what you guys &amp; gals said, I see why it&rsquo;s better to do it myself (was not satisfied with how it came out (being vectored well and then the whip coming off as free hand (-_ - &quot; ) .)</p>
<p>The fonts said here, I&rsquo;ll try them all out to find what feels appropriate. With all the comments, it seems that all of you seem to say that I should just use 1 family type, is that correct? I still do need to compliment it with another typeface as a requirement in the course, but I do see that two different weights of the same family works as well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">You don&rsquo;t necessarily need 1 typeface. I usually think 2 typefaces is the better option. It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;ve been focusing on your current problem, which is to identify a typeface which can work well for your logo or will work as a basis for your logo. If you want advise on a complimentary typeface I think we need to have a better idea of which direction you&rsquo;re headed. I think I would first finish the logo and then find a secondary typeface.</div>
