body: "Hi,\r\nI've been asked to create a seal for a community in Ecuador. First design
  was judged \"too scandinavian\" and sophisticated/abstract and a more local sensory
  style was wished. \r\n\r\nNow my question: How do seals look like in south american
  tradition? \r\nWhat symbols, abstractions, reductions and content is used? \r\nWhat's
  the local style for a seal?\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if some examples could be posted.
  So I can see the surrounding field.\r\nCan anyone help? \r\nThanks!"

  body: I'd imagine (perhaps quite wrongly) that their design follows that of Iberia.  Generally
    you'd have some symbol/coat of arms/etc with the name of the organization or person
    going around it in a circle and potentially a latin phrase or a subdeparment name.  I
    don't know what scandinavian seals look like so I can't really make a comparison.

  body: No offense intended, but why don't they have a local designer do it, if local
    style is what's desired? At the very least, you might try to identify a local
    designer to collaborate/consult with you and your agency.

  body: "Thanks for the answers!\r\n\r\n@kentlew: I also thought of this, but the
    task was initially handed over to me and though we talked about it (especially
    after first design) it wasn't an option for now. \r\nIf so I'd gladly propose(d)
    it to this list to find one.\r\nI'll probably post images if I'm a step further.\r\n\r\nAnd:
    I'm still interested in the actual \"seal language\" over there, so if someone
    has an example at hand and if it doesn't bother too much to post a small image
    I'd be very glad!"

  body: Ah, I was thinking of seals (sellos) no seal/coat of arm (escudo).  Maybe
    it's just 'cause I'm designing my own one right now.

  body: "Hi Ricardo Cordoba, hi guifa,\r\n\r\nthanks for those examples!\r\nSorry
    for letting you wait more than a week, but I've been very busy and then on a conference
    for some days.\r\n\r\nMy question regards seals for documents, that means: Metal
    stamps used with ink or used embossing the paper to give a special authorization
    to a document, e.g. a contract or legal issue, or state's documents.\r\nSo it's
    normally a round seal with an average diameter of 30 mm to maximum 40 mm.\r\n\r\nSo
    the examples are helpful - some of them are very interesting and lead me a step
    forward - but the general collection not quite meets my central questions.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the material and technical conditions: Stamps used with one color or as emboosing
    stamps with no color.\r\nSo there is a reduced amount of possible visualizations.
    \r\nAnd then the question: What symbols? What kind of visual language is used?\r\n\r\nLet's
    say you wanted to visualize trustworthiness, reliability, local rootedness, or
    whatever - what would you put in your seal and in what manner?\r\n"
