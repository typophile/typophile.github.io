  body: "SF Fedora is a decent font, but there are issues that you should be aware
    of. You can compare the Fedora font (and also a font called \"Adventure\" by Neale
    Davidson) on my website. Yes, I know this is a shameless plug, but my Safari font
    really is the best Indiana Jones font out there.\r\n\r\nDesigning a typeface based
    on the \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (Indiana Jones) poster is much trickier than
    one might guess. It's not a matter of simply tracing the artwork on the poster.
    Try tracing the letters in \"Raiders\" and then spelling the word \"ideas.\" It
    will look bad -- real bad. In order to get the font to work you have to redraw
    every glyph and make all kinds of adjustments so that when you use the font, and
    type out a word, it looks presentable.\r\n\r\nI've spent a lot of time making
    \"Safari\" look good. I hope you'll compare it to the others.\r\n\r\nhttp://davidocchino.com/portfolio/typography/safari.html#compare\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you can give me any feedback on how to make the font even better, I'd love
    to hear it. Thanks!\r\n\r\nDavid Occhino\r\nDavid Occhino Design"
