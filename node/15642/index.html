  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m setting the Lady Macbeth &lsquo;Unsex me&rsquo; speech and have been reading about the story (I didn&rsquo;t have the goodluck to study it at school) and getting a basic background before embarking on starting a full on project. I know this story was written in the 17th century and thought to remain true to the history would try to find a font relevant. I&rsquo;ve looked at English Gothic fonts and though I&rsquo;ve not done a hugely indepth search, the ones I&rsquo;ve been looking at tend to come up as Blackletter which is not the route I wanted to go down, as I still want the speech to be fairly legible so thought a serif would be a better choice?</p>
<p>So does anyone have any ideas that spring to mind? I&rsquo;ve looked through typowiki at the history of the fonts listed there and Garamond and Bembo were two that had undergone changes but were around at the time (or so the numbers say :-))</p>
<p>This is more of a side project to my main project of documenting and mapping people using type so I&rsquo;m trying to use the font and the way its set to give a voice to Lady Macbeth so her personality of ambition and hunger for power come through. I just need pointing in some direction as I feel like I&rsquo;ve lost a wheel and I&rsquo;m going around in circles :)</p>
<p>Anyway help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>&hellip;you will find many examples of 17th century printed works of Shakespeare&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t know whose types they were using, but they weren&rsquo;t Caslon&rsquo;s.

what a great find for source material on early Shakespeare publications!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what is so useful about the web&hellip; results within minutes!
Remember searching through mountains of books in the library (NYC Public Library on 42nd st. for me) for source and reference material?</p>
<p>The only MAJOR difference is close examination of printed material as opposed to screen resolution. You can&rsquo;t have everything&hellip; yet.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you want to evoke the time in which the play was first performed or published, then types like Caslon or a Fleischmann revival are all much too late and in completely the wrong style. Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays date from the very early years of the 17th century, and the typography of the first folio edition is essentially late renaissance or mannerist. See, for example, this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0393039854/ref=sib_rdr_zmin/002-4794442-0124013?p=S01G&j=1#reader-page">facsimile page</a>.</p>
<p>Ferguson&rsquo;s <em>Pica Roman Type in Elizabethan England</em> is worth consulting to get an idea of the kind of generic type popular in England during Shakespeare&rsquo;s lifetime. The elaborateness of style and quality of printing had advanced by the time of the first editions of Shakespeare&rsquo;s work, but Caslon&rsquo;s types are too close to the baroque to really substitute.</p>
<p>All that said, I think you could have much more fun responding typographically to the content of Lady M&rsquo;s soliloquy rather than to the historical period of its composition.</p>

<p>Ok, point taken.</p>
<p>But are there any digital types out there with the &lsquo;antique&rsquo; look from that period? That&rsquo;s why I was thinking of Founders Caslon or the Farnham, which is so mannered as to look a little different and suggest another era. Ok they&rsquo;re historically wrong, but they can suggest &lsquo;antique&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>But as you say, maybe to suggest &lsquo;old&rsquo; is not the best route anyway.</p>

I was only asking for help, I have done a fair bit of research on the internet since asking for help and also spent most of yesterday in the letterpress at uni to work out what would work, sourcing Jacobian fonts and such.</p>
<p>Honestly this is why I tend not to post here, but just lurk because you ask a question and countless times people just rip you to shreds. I don&rsquo;t know everything, I thought most of you guys were professionals hence my asking your learned opinion.</p>
<p>To those who helped thank you, I now have some other avenues to work along.</p>
