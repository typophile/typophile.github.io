  of offering TOP QUALITY in terms of print-quality, paper-stocks and coatings/options.
  \ I cannot find a decent printer in the Kansas City area (where I'm located).  I
  want a printer that CARES about making great work and preferably one that is open
  to doing smallish runs (1000-ish)\r\n\r\nAnyone point me in the right direction?\r\n\r\n"
