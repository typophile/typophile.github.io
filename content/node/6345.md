  body: Reminds me of Gill Sans, but the J and the r have been altered. The J has
    been raised optically onto the baseline. The underbite on the e is very Gill Sans
    though.

  body: It reminds me more of Eras than Gill, but in any case i&#39;m pretty sure
    the &#39;r&#39; has been altered, and, if it really is Eras, the &#39;y&#39; as
    well. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-eras/bold/testdrive.html?s=Jewelry&amp;p=72">Eras
