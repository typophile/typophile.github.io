  type in use. By this I mean photographs of typography in the real world &#40;book
  covers, posters, food packaging, you name it&#41; categorised by font, weight, &#40;rough&#41;
  location, media, subject &#40;Personal hygene, sport, electronics etc.&#41; and
  so on. This was initialy envisaged as a student tool, to help first year students
  answer the perennial question '

  body: Peter Karrow has been working on a database of magazine advertising &#40;he
    talked about it at ICTVC2&#41; it would be super cool to add the names of the
    typefaces used in each ad to the database - even automating the process by some
    super-advanced version of MyFonts &#39;what the font&#39; identifier. Add the
    names of the ad agency that created the ad and a database of font licensees and
    you could even include automatic invoicing if unlicensed fonts were being used.
    Then again maybe not.  <BR> <BR>Si

  body: I think that it is a great idea. Although, as you mentioned, many foundries
    post examples of their types in use, all examples that I&#39;ve seen have been
    woefully incomplete. Plus, even sites with large databeses don&#39;t ever include
    everything or every foundry

  body: Dan, thanks for your encouragement. <BR> <BR>I am prepared for the long haul
    on this project. <BR> <BR>In order for it to be comprehensive, I think it will
    have to invlove public submissions, and, ideally, some sort of involvement with
    the foundries themselves. That is going to be the real difficulty in my view;
    persuading the later that this will be a worthwhile investment of their time.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks again

  body: That&#39;s my plan at the moment. A prototype with roughly 500 images is about
    60% complete now. <BR> <BR>I am about to start an MA in Communicationa Art and
    Design at the Royal College of Art in London, and I plan to consult with tutors
    there before approaching anybody. Hopefully the project&#39;s status as an MA
    project and a bit of name dropping will open a few doors.
