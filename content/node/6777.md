    A nice digital interpretation is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/shango/regular/testdrive.html">Shango</a>
    by Jason Castle, but that has the U with the tail. I made the ID from Jaspert
    et al&#39;s Encyclopaedia of Type Faces, but the sample given there doesn&#39;t
    show the U, so it&#39;s hard to tell for sure.

    as some people say &#34;cliches are cliches because they&#39;re true&#34; &#40;which
    may itself be a cliche!&#41; so perhaps Trajan is used simply because it&#39;s
    so pretty. Oh, and for the sake of completeness and because it may help, and here&#39;s

    I wouldn&#39;t exactly call Hollywood a hotbed of innovation. They keep cranking
    out the same movies with the same posters because they&#39;re afraid to try something
    different. <BR> <BR>I just read that Jude Law is going to be in 6 movies between

    but I am gonna be mighty sick of his face  too in 3 months. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    used Trajan plenty too. When you present it to a client along with a bunch of
    other ideas, they just love it. It is a beautiful font. But you have to know when
    you use it that every graphic designer is gonna look at it and go &#34;oh, Trajan.

  body: "Hey, Typophilics -- this is an old thread, http://www.typophile.com/node/6777,
    but it's funny because I just found it. I was looking for something else, and
    this came up. To the nature of the font, it's not Trajan -- it's a customized
    Girvin titling font; surely, it's based on 1st century epigraphy, but not on Twombly's
    Trajan. Trust me, I've had so many of my logotype renderings converted into Trajan
    solutions by agencies, it's a joke. \r\n\r\nI've been working as a designer for
    motion picture marketing since 1978-79, and Apocalypse Now, Francis Coppola. And
    what happens is that you create solutions that are endlessly juried and judged
    by either the directors, the studio leadership, the talent, whomever is involved
    in the proposition -- and toned down. The art fullness, diminished. So, doing
    a rendering of the Last Samurai, or Lord of the Rings, Gladiator -- The Ghost
    and the Darkness -- or Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, each of
    these treatments is entirely customized -- tuned and built by hand. And if there's
    an agency conversion, the customized solutions move to easily built imitation
    solutions by the agencies, and...the work is gone. \r\n\r\nMore here on that:

    said, as they say in the comics. \r\n\r\nI started working on Lemony Snicket as
    a production designer for Count Olaf's eyes -- which then became part of the logo,
    then from there, building out the fonts and related work to create the master
    -- for a committee and client team of 15. \r\n\r\nRough, but done.  \r\n\r\nReach,

  body: "Thanks Tim for bringing this post back to life.  I remember reading a list
    in a \"Print\" column years ago, written by a design God of the moment. It was
    about things that were great and things that sucked in design.  Top of his list
    for the sucky was \"any movie poster.\" That was at least 10 years ago and those
    unfortunate words come to mind every time I see one.  And while it's not always
    true (think Juno and Little Miss Sunshine for refreshing departures) I've tended
    to agree with him most of the time.\r\n\r\nI had to double check to make sure
    it was actually you posting, for as I was reading the earlier entries I knew that
    they were talking about some of your work. What the \"movie voiceover guy\" (as
    he is actually known) is to trailers, you've been to movie logos. And just as
    others try to imitate him, you've created a look that the industry feels the need
    to bastardize and perpetuate. \r\n\r\nI wasn't aware of the scope of your film
    work and the quite successful niche you've created until a few years back when
    I came across your name and remembered you for all the fantastic hand drawn logos
    and type treatments that were all over the design and type annuals back in the
    day. That was a rare gift of beauty and wit you showed us.  Would love to see
    more of that again.  Throw away that computer.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nPatrick\r\n\r\nhttp://typographyshop.com"

  body: "Patrick, sweet, your comments -- thanks for your generosity of spirit. I
    claim nothing, really. Simply that the idea of creating a logo for a film is like
    creating an identity for something else -- except that, perhaps, it gets a little
    more out there. The exposures are bigger, and perhaps even in some instances,
    international. \r\n\r\nBut the real telling is in the telling itself. Any motion
    picture identity treatment is about telling the story in a kind of compressed
    concretion of space. The motion picture logo can be, literally, the first thing
    that comes into play. It's the teaser for what's to come. Then, finally, months,
    if not nearly a year later, the film logo is the last thing out, that tiny little
    space ad that you see. Last week! \r\n\r\nIron man, I'd attest, will be in play
    much longer. \r\n\r\nMore on that, later -- except for now, there's this: http://blog.girvin.com/?p=768\r\n\r\nThanks,
