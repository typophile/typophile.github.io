  if someone with a little more experience in this area could please help?\r\n\r\nIn
  my quest, I've found quite a few older Letraset scripts that are almost similar,
  yet nothing exact. I figured before throwing in the towel and assuming it's handlettered,
  I'd ask someone here for their help. \r\n\r\nThe reason I mention Letraset is, while
  searching the MyFonts site, I noticed a good number of their script fonts are somewhat
  off the wall. Which in a sense, is exactly what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  offer a little help in my quest? Thank you.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/champ_5110.jpg]"

    It has some similarities, especially the angular shapes."
