  thing that is bothering me though is the kerning.\r\n\r\ni have a title that is
  set at 50pt in the bold variant, but for some reason the metrics setting make the
  spacing look weird to me. setting it to optics seems better.\r\n\r\nis this normal?\r\n\r\nis
  this an indesign or meta thing?\r\n\r\nany ideas?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: Kerning is more of an art than a science. While I would say the 'oc' pair
    in the Metrics sample is too loose, there are many pairs in the Optical sample
    that are too tight, and the 'ry' is too loose. Remember also that text fonts are
    kerned for text sizes (check the samples at 11pt) and Optical spacing is best
    left for headlines and used with care.

  body: "hmmm... interesting. in this sample, i still prefer the optical overall in
    this sample.\r\n\r\nin the serif - the 'ry' seems fine in both to me. and around
    the 'o' seems better in the optical.\r\n\r\nin the sans - your're right about
    thr 'ry', but check out the 'om'! the optical is heaps better! even is the 'sub-head'
    the 'o' seems to cause probs for metrics.\r\n\r\nthanks stephen!"

  body: "Not only is kerning more an art than a science, opinions differ, with few
    completely \"right\" or \"wrong\" answers. With really bad kerning, you might
    get 98 out of 100 people to agree it is bad.\r\n\r\nAs Stephen Coles pointed out,
    text fonts are kerned at text sizes. Moreover, foundry kerning has to assume any
    mix of letters. WA has to be kerned for a following \"L\" or a following \"V\";
    only one value permitted in the font.\r\n\r\nThe rule at our shop (composition)
    is that display type must always be hand kerned. No font-based kerning can cover
    the all the sizes, the variations in letters used, the variations in the number
    of words in the title. These are all at play."
