  the \"H\" and the \"S.\" Any ideas? (And thanks for anything that might be offered!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Wind

  body: "Hand lettering in the style of the era. Note the variations in repeating
    letters. \r\nThe beaked terminals on _T_ and  _S_ are distinctive, but are found
    in some fonts of the 1900s. Also with _E_ similar to the title. For example check
    the fonts at Greater Albion Typefounders http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Greater_Albion_Typefounders/
    and you might find something you like. Note the similarities with Bonning, Bonaventure
    and Vertrina.\r\nOther similars include Canada Type's Ronaldson http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/
    and Intellecta's Benjamin Franklin   http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/benjamin-franklin/\r\nDon"

    offered. I noted the variation, but never thought about hand lettering. It is
    a lesson for me to better consider the period of the piece.\r\n\r\nWith my regards,
    \r\nKurt"
