body: 'Lesson One <BR> <BR>A famous calligrapher was sitting on a tree <BR>resting,
  doing nothing.  A small type designer <BR>saw the man of letters and asked him,
  &#34;Can I <BR>also sit like you and do nothing ?&#34;  <BR>The calligrapher answered
  : &#34;Sure, why not ?&#34; <BR>So, the type designer sat on the ground below <BR>the
  calligrapher and rested. All of a sudden, <BR>a foundry appeared, hired the type
  designer <BR>and took advantage on him. <BR> <BR>Management Lesson : <BR> <BR>To
  be sitting and doing nothing, you must be  <BR>sitting very, very high up. <BR>
  <BR> <BR> <BR>Lesson Two <BR> <BR>A sad type designer saw a bull and started to
  <BR>tell him his thoughts.  &#34;Oh, bull, I would love <BR>to be able to get to
  the top of the font design <BR>tree,&#34; sighed the sad type designer, &#34;but
  I have <BR>not got the energy.&#34;  Suddenly the bull voiced : <BR> <BR>&#34;Well,
  why don&#39;t you nibble on some of my  <BR>droppings ?&#34; replied the bull. &#34;They&#39;re
  packed  <BR>with nutrients.&#34; <BR> <BR>The sad type designer pecked at a lump
  of dung, <BR>and found it actually gave him enough strength <BR>to reach the lowest
  branch of the font tree. <BR>The next day, after eating some more dung, he <BR>reached
  the second branch facing a slab typeface. <BR>Finally after a fourth night spent
  in front of <BR>FontLab, the type designer was proudly perched <BR>at the top of
  the font tree with an OpenType in <BR>his hands. <BR>He was promptly spotted by
  a craftsman, who shot  <BR>him out of the tree. <BR> <BR>Management Lesson : <BR>
  <BR>Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won&#39;t  <BR>keep you there. <BR>
  <BR> <BR> <BR>Lesson Three <BR> <BR>A little Finnish type designer girl was flying
  <BR>south for the winter.  Getting to the airport, <BR>it was so cold that the girl
  froze and fell to <BR>the ground into a large field in the middle of <BR>a forest.  While
  she was lying there, a reindeer <BR>came by and dropped some dung on her. <BR>As
  the frozen girl lay there in the pile of dung, <BR>she began to realize how warm
  she was.  The dung <BR>was actually thawing her out!  She lay there all <BR>warm
  and happy, and soon began to sing for joy, <BR>&#34;the ABCs of love...&#34; &#40;<a

  <BR>A passing Art Director man heard the girl singing <BR>and came to investigate.
  <BR>Following the sound, the AD discovered the girl <BR>under the pile of reindeer
  dung, and promptly dug <BR>her out and took advantage on her. <BR> <BR>Management
  Lesson : <BR> <BR>1. Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy. <BR>2. Not everyone
  who gets you out of &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; is your <BR>   friend. <BR>3. And when
  you are in deep &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;, it is best to  <BR>   keep your mouth
  shut !'
