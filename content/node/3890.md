  my attempt at a single weight, ultra-extended sans. I wanted to steer clear of curveballs
  for my own learning purposes. I was shooting for rounds that gave a nod to, but
  weren&#39;t squared &#40;like bank gothic or eurostile extended&#41;. Also this
  is my first time to attach a swf. Hope it works. <BR> <BR>-Randy'

  body: ' Hi. <BR> <BR>This is the my stab at the some lower case. It&#39;s my first
    time venturing into the lc. Considerably trickier. I&#39;m not sure how I like
    it. It&#39;s not nearly as even weight as the UC. Any thoughts or suggestions?

    image of it. I see that your finishes are cut off..a little more stylized. but
    - this could easily be mistaken for a Microgramma clone. '

    This face bears a passing resemblance to Novarese&#39;s design, but is much less

  body: ' He he. <BR> <BR>Is it just me or is Microgramma the same &#40;or almost
    exactly the same&#41; as Eurostile also by Novarese. As mentioned in the first
    post, I was trying to design something that, as marc mentioned, is less geometric
    &#40;the shoulders of the letters aren&#39;t nearly as square&#41;. <BR>In fairness
    though, the lower case is quite Eurostile-ish, particularly where the branches/bowls
    meet the vertical stems. I may have to rework the way these join to reference
    Novarese less. Thoughts? <BR>All that aside, my favorite is the uc G. <BR>Thanks.

    <BR>I wouldn&#39;t think you were nodding to Novarese. I&#39;d think its a copy.
    Perhaps your attempt to be less geometric isin&#39;t round enough yet.  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s

    lowercase added.
