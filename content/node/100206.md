  body: "Thanks Ryuk and Bojev, good observations!\r\nWe are looking for exact typeface
    here, as it is part of some historical work in conjunction with an extensive exhibition
    of Melin og \xD6sterlin's work, to be held soon in Oslo.\r\n\r\nAny other leads
    are much apreciated!"

    neither \u2014 more likely phototype. Do you need to recreate this setting, or
    do you need a full typeface? I see Yokoland is curating the exhibition. I know
    they have the skills to recreate this. Why not ask them? And if not, my office
    is just down the hallway from them."

  body: "After talking to a few people it looks quite likely that this is phototypeset
    Futura, squished and stretched to justify. Roth always used futura apparently.
    Also is pretty obvious this was designed by Roth, not M&\xD6 as well!\r\n\r\nOg
    takk for inspill Frode, ikke Yokoland her, mer en slags sympatis\xF8r. "
