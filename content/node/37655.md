  body: This was hand lettered -- or custom designed if you will. Nowadays it is easy
    as pie to enlarge the font in your design program at will, but back then every
    size had to be cut and cast. We're talking entirely different production methods
    here. Any type quite large -- especially magazine nameplates and slogans in advertisements
    -- was done by hand.

  body: Trajan? No way, the M doesn't match at all. Maybe Weiss Antiqua or Berling.
    Check FontShop.com.

  body: So, let's take a look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/felix_titling/?sample_text=TIME&sample_size=96">Felix
    Titling</a>. Already quite close.

    Saks</a> as well. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/goudy_std/?sample_text=TIME&sample_size=96\">Goudy
    Oldstyle</a> has the correct type of M, but the serifs are too pronounced.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I compare all these options, I get the impression this nameplate may have been
    done by [[Frederic W. Goudy]] himself."
