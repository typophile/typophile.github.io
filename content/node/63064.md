    last post of mine (which was written in response to your post, in turn directed
    at me) as the conversation seemed to have been left hanging in the air ?\r\n\r\nSpecifically,
    regarding AIGA's position that the spec work is damaging to the clients. Following
    AIGA's logic, BrandStack is as harmful to the clients as the 99designs. Yet no
    one here or on other logo-related sites calling to boycott it.\r\n"

  body: I don't agree with tread about contest submissions because contests gave me
    a lot of practice and skills. I am new at logo design so I must learn a lot (make
    a lot of logos) and contests give me an opportunity.

  body: "I can understand both sides.\r\n\r\nThe professional would see at design
    contests as an easy (and cheap) way for 'clients' to choose the best design(s)
    from a whole catalogue of 'free' works, hence eliminating the professional consultation.
    It sucks.\r\n\r\nThe amateur designer sees design contests as a way to test their
    work against like-minded amateur designers, and to build on their own competency/skills
    level in designing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, a solution could be tutoring from the professional
    to the amateur? Takes time and considerable effort, of course.\r\n\r\nA professional
    could come up with a logo/design challenge and entries/submissions by amateurs
    are critique upon.. Amateur receives feedback required. In the long run, professional
    protects his rice-bowl..?\r\n\r\nnagfa"

    a better designer.\r\n\r\nBut could anybody tell me something about my logo proposal?
    I am looking for critiques here, hehe ;)"

    with a cruddy logo and redesign it?

    getting feedback at all. You win or don't win. \r\n\r\nWhy don't you make up fake
    businesses and design for them than put them on here for critique. I think it'll
    be more beneficial than doing spec work, which really is never a good idea."

  body: "Spec work is an extremely touchy subject, and you should in absolutely no
    way attempt to learn anything from a real design process through these \"contests.\"
    It's said ad infinitum why you shouldn't: you lose the chance to consult a client,
    the potential to be ripped off is extremely high, and you usually get less than
    what you're really worth (if you get paid at all).\r\n\r\nIf you want feedback,
    why not try sites like Logopond, deviantART, Flickr... the list goes on and on.
    What's even more enraging is that I just found <a href=\"http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/emergien_logo_logotype_design/details\">the
    contest on Crowdspring</a>, and they're only offering $400? Seriously? A global
    firm whose image needs desperately to appeal to investors and businesses of all
    kinds, while showing dozens of personality traits... $400. That's the mark they
    will use for the rest of their existence as the face of their company, and you
    think that costs $400? That's not even one month's rent for you, even if you live
    in an efficiency apartment.\r\n\r\nAnyways, you posted up your design to be critiqued.
    I think that the type looks very dated. And why did you break the pattern of shapes
    at the bottom of the \"e\"? The first version possesses very muted and dull colors
    in my eyes, while the second... I like the cyan, but why the gradient? It looks
    like it's casting a shadow of doubt on the mark."

    spec work."

  body: "In the first two images, the first thing that catches my eye is how busy
    the e logo is, but that is taken care of for me by the second two which just use
    gradients. The shapes could be a bit much, but it seems like the alternating colors
    in the first two images are what make it busy. Maybe it's just me; I AM a huge
    fan of gradients. It's a great design though! I especially like the font used
    in the name of the company.\r\n\r\nR//R\r\nweb.me.com/kyleleitch"
