  and here&#39;s the few glyphs that I&#39;ve created so far.  Am I going in the right
  direction?  Should I follow in this path?  I will be posting updates when I get
  further in the design, so this is kind of a preliminary post.  Thanks! <BR> <BR>The

  body: Like I mentioned in that other thread, I think it would be great if the stencil
    gaps had some decoration to them, instead of being just plain shears. You have
    a little bit of that  in the &#34;E&#34; and &#34;F&#34; - and that&#39;s the
    <i>minimum</i> I would do to all the gaps. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Thanks Hrant and Stephen.  I will definately start experimenting with new
    kinds of stencil gaps.  I should have a new update ready in a couple of days.  I&#39;m
    determined to follow this project through.  Thank you for your support!

  body: 'I think you&#39;re doing a fine job here, and it definitely has potential
    to be better than the original. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s only one characteristic of
    the original that I don&#39;t see you capturing &#40;I have the Solotype book&#41;:
    the pips on the rounds &#40;C and O&#41; pull the curve out a bit, while on your
    version they seem to just be thorns on the stalk &#40;as <i>is</i> the case for
    the pips on the sides of straights in the original&#41;.'

  body: Ralph, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help!  It took a little while to figure out
    what the pips are.  But you&#39;re definately right!  I did use modified thorns
    from the &#39;I&#39; on the &#39;O&#39; and &#39;C&#39;.  I will try to use the
    curve to pull out the pips, instead of having my curve with added thorns.  Thanks!
    <BR> <BR>P.S. I checked out your website.  I didn&#39;t know that you were an
    inventor.  That&#39;s pretty amazing. <BR> <BR>P.P.S. My hundreth post.  Hooray
    for me!  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: Ricardo, <BR> <BR>Thank you for the encourement! I&#39;m still battling with
    the stencil gaps, I&#39;ve experimented with some shapes, but I haven&#39;t found
    any that I like yet. I&#39;m not sure how I will handle the stroke width variation
    yet. If you look at the &#39;A&#39; and &#39;N&#39; in the original sample there&#39;s
    is some variation. I will probably see what the glyphs looks like with uniform
    stroke, and then vary it it make letters less &#34;heavy&#34;. For example &#39;W&#39;
    would look pretty solid if all the legs were the same width as the &#39;I&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: Yes, I see what you mean. The original <b>A</b> is also a bit top-heavy, and
    that big black triangle in the place where the crossbar should be makes it look
    heavier still, IMHO.  :-D <BR> <BR>Please post new samples when you have some
    more!
