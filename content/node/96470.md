body: "Using the Hindi keyboard and typing the following sequence of keystrokes below
  I get :\r\n\r\nShift + 4         \u0930\u094D\r\nShift + 4         \u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D\r\nShift
  + 4         \u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D\r\nBackspace     \u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D\u0930\r\nBackspace
  \    \u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D\r\nBackspace     \u0930\u094D\u0930\r\nBackspace     \u0930\u094D\r\nBackspace
  \    \u0930\r\nBackspace\r\n\r\nThis is the way I understand what is occurring above
  :\r\n\r\n<ol><li>The key Shift + 4 inputs at once the Hindi character \u0930 (j)
  combined with the virama diacritics \u094D (d). In fact, if one types these two
  characters in sequence, with the Hindi keyboard, one gets the character \u0930\u094D.</li>\r\n<li>Therefore
  when I type the second combination Shift + 4, I get first, the combination of the
  glyph \u0930\u094D with the character \u0930, which results in \u0930\u094D\u0930
  (this doesn't seem to be a valid glyph in devanagari), which is followed by the
  combination of   \u0930\u094D\u0930 with the virama, resulting in \u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D
  (again possibly another invalid glyph), which equals the second glyph obtained above.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>
  Continuing with the exercise we get first \u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D\u0930 and finally
  \ \u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D which equals the third glyph obtained in
  the diagram above.</li>\r\n<li>Now if we type the 6 Backspace keys in sequence,
  we should obtain the remaining glyphs shown above.</ol>\r\n\r\nQuestion : Why the
  shaping engine allows the rendering of those extraneous glyphs, instead of simply
  rendering \u0930\u094D \u0930\u094D, for the keys (Shift + 4)(Shift + 4) and  \u0930\u094D
  \u0930\u094D \u0930\u094D for the keys (Shift + 4)(Shift + 4)(Shift + 4)  ?"

  body: "Have you read up on the special treatment of the letter Ra in Devanagari
    conjuncts?\r\n\r\nThe sequence \u0930\u094D (R with killed vowel) at the beginning
    of a conjunct is always rendered as the repha form, i.e. the little hook above
    the last letter of the conjunct. So when you enter the sequence twice you get
    \u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D, which is the conjunct RR with killed vowel.\r\n\r\nWhen
    the sequence virama+Ra occurs following another letter in a conjunct, it takes
    the rakar form, which is either the little hat below the letter as in this case,
    or a stroke merged with the full form of the letter. So when you enter the sequence
    three times you get \u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D, which is the conjunct
    RRR with killed vowel. The first R is displayed as the repha, the second R is
    displayed as a full form, the third R is displayed as the rakar form. The explicit
    halant (virama) always indicates that the final vowel is killed.\r\n\r\nNone of
    these are 'invalid glyphs' (indeed, they're not glyphs per se, but combinations
    of glyphs) in the writing system, although I believe RRR is probably not found
    in actual languages. RR may be."

    body: "John\r\n\r\nThanks for calling my attention to the treatment of the letter
      \u0930 in conjuncts. I haven't had the time to read this subject yet. The amount
      of information that I'm processing in the last few days is just mind-boggling.\r\nBut
      after carefully studying the subject presented in [[http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ch09.pdf|Chapter
      9 : South Asian Scripts - I]] published by the Unicode Consortium, I think I
      finally understood what's going on here. I'll just repeat below the steps I
      used to achieve the results obtained by the shaping engine, using the rules
      stated in the referenced\r\ndocument :\r\n\r\nAccording to the Rule R2 in page
      275 of the document we have : \u0930\u094D + \u0930\u094D = \u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D
      . Now applying rule R8 in page 277 we get : [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Consonant
      RA_5122.png]\r\n\r\nI had to use the image above, for I couldn't figure out
      how to print the cincunflex under the dotted circle. BTW, is there a way of
      printing on this editor a Unicode point, as one does in MS Word, i.e., by typing
      the Unicode character code followed by Alt + x ?\r\n\r\nThe final glyph, although
      not very clear, should stand for \u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D\u0930\u094D, i.e.,
      Shift + 4 applied 3 times.\r\n\r\nDo you agree with this approach ?"

  body: "The dotted circle is U+25CC.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you mean by asking
    if I agree with this approach? This is normal Devanagari shaping, according to
    script rules, but in practice it is very unusual to have even a RR conjunct, let
    alone RRR. Most commonly, the repha key, i.e. the shift+4 on your keyboard, which
    inputs Ra + halant, would be followed by another letter."

    body: "<cite>The dotted circle is U+25CC</cite>\r\n\r\nOk, but how do I print
      this character here ? In MS Word, you just type 25CC followed by Alt + x, and
      the character pops up in the Word document. Is there something similar in the
      Typophile editor ?\r\n\r\n<cite>I'm not sure what you mean by asking if I agree
      with this approach?</cite>\r\n\r\nI was just trying to make sure I was on the
      right track, after reading so much info about the Devanagari script. That's
      all.\r\n\r\n<cite> it is very unusual to have even a RR conjunct, let alone
