  font for a client, and I am not sure of the difference between Lucida Sans, Lucida
  Grande and Lucida Sans Unicode in a function sort of way.\r\nIs it necessary that
  I tell my client to use one font if he uses a PC (Sans Unicode) or a mac (Grande)?\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Most glyphs are identical, BUT....\r\n\r\nLucida Sans has a regular, bold,
    italic and bold italic available. Lucida Grande only has regular and bold, and
    Lucida Sans Unicode has only regular.\r\n\r\nBoth Lucida Grande and Lucida Sans
    Unicode have larger character coverage (both languages and symbols) than Lucida
    Sans.\r\n\r\nFor all the characters they have in common, Lucida Sans and Lucida
    Sans Unicode have identical designs. Lucida Grande has just a very few differences,
    notably:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>\"1\" has a baseline serif</li>\r\n<li>hyphen is longer</li>\r\n<li>\"@\"
    is larger and more upright</li></ul>\r\n\r\n"

  body: What Thomas said is true for the system font versions (i.e. Lucida Grande
    in OSX). The retail version of Lucida Grande has a lot more styles, see http://lucidafonts.com/
