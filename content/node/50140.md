  body: "My guess is that it is modified [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-bauhaus/|Bauhaus]],
    with the terminals rounded. It seems well-made, but it's still a 33 year old design.
    Either some looks never go out of style, or there is a failure of imagination
    (or both?).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Your guess is probably right... And the comments sound very pertinent :-)  Fashion
    also hits typography and also here winds of revival seem to blow -- and I've seen
    a renewed wave of interest in the rounded forms of Bauhaus and related cousins...
    Anyway, many thanks for the feedback.

  body: "It's interesting that you say 'renewed wave of interest', because I have
    been doing this ID thing for nine years, and the first [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces.html|Font
    ID Guide]] I made was for Bauhaus-style fonts, because the newsgroups I took part
    in at the time had requests for these styles all the time. (The earliest version
    was late 1999)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
