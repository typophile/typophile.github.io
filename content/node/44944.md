body: Anyone know why Mac apps don't allow you to spec vertical layouts in agate lines?
  I'm doing a gig that involves making up a lot of newspaper ads, and I'm constantly
  having to translate them into inches or picas. Made a slip the other day that could've
  been a big deal if I hadn't caught it.

  body: "Quark XPress does allow the use of agate lines on the Mac, but Adobe apps
    don't use it anywhere, and I can't think of any other apps that do off the top
    of my head.\r\n\r\nIn the US, newspapers or magazines don't still spec agate lines
    exclusive of any other measurement, and it's certainly a unit (like most typesetting-specific
    terms) that has been in decline ever since DTP started taking off in the 80s.\r\n\r\nConsumer
    classifieds use per-word or per-character charges, and commercial space is generally
    specced by specific dimensions that are a fraction of the page or of a column
    (and specced primarily as inches or metric on the rate sheet), rather than allowing
    advertisers to buy arbitrary numbers of agate lines or column inches. That makes
    it easier to swap ads around on the newspaper's side, and to drop in preexisting
    PSAs or in-house ads for any unsold space at the very last second."

  body: Hm. I'm not working in the U.S., so maybe that accounts for it. Montreal papers,
    both English and French, still use agates. I imagine I'll be converting them yet
    for awhile.

  body: "Interesting, they use agates but don't even have a metric equivalent already
    listed? That's amazing, how do they deal with all the small businesses out there
    that create their own ads and don't have any idea what an agate is?\r\n\r\nI'm
    surprised Adobe hasn't supported agate as a unit if its still commonly used anywhere,
    particularly Canada which is such a huge market. I know they support custom units,
    have you tried that?\r\n\r\nOh, wait, I just checked and it seems agate units
    were added in InDesign CS3! I was trying to see how the custom units were specced
    and there it was, and google confirmed agates were just added in CS3, so now you
    have an excuse to upgrade :D"

  body: "Hi there\r\n\r\nNat's absolutely right about this. Yet another reason to
    go CS3. It came up in class the other week, and I admit I was suprised to see
    agates there in the measurement preferences \u2013 none of the current students
    seem to have the slightest interest in newspaper work.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-2_6088.jpg]"

  body: "Do they still use agates much in NZ, Ben?\r\n\r\nI loved working on newspapers,
    but that was my first job. It was great to see results the next morning, plus
    there was such a huge volume that I could experiment and play around a lot. Some
    of that coolness has probably been replaced for students by the instant gratification
    of the Web, but there's something special about being able to hold it in your
    hand.\r\n\r\nThere's certainly no faster way to learn about dot gain and ink behavior
    than on high-speed newsprint :)"
