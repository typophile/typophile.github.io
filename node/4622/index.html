		<div class="commentbody">During the revival period I believe many metal faces were redrawn from printed specimens sheets, but many, if not most, of the faces that are associated with the metal type libraries of Linotype, Monotype, Ludlow, have actually been digitized from photofilm versions. Um, with the notable exception of Lanston. And brilliant that was Gerald G. <BR> <BR>I know of a few exceptions with Monotype Typography as well. The digital Dante and, most likely the Pastonchi, were redrawn from master patterns of the metal type. <BR> <BR>I believe that at one point Ludlow UK was quite intent on buying up old Ludlow film from a source in Canada for their digitizations. <BR> <BR>But to get more to the original question. You would not actually want to preserve a metal face per se for digital as you would not have wanted to for photofilm. The printing technologies associated with these type technologies have/had different needs and require/d different approaches. <BR> <BR>Reversing the situation, printing digital type letterpress, is a whole other animal. There, yes, the considerations of the how and why of the design of a metal type face are quite crucial, and not easily replicated with the available tools. <BR> <BR>Gerald</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Probably the biggest loss that comes to mind is optical scaling. In metal, each size was inherently different anyway, but when automatic scaling was introduced (way before phototype - I'm talking about the Benton pantograph) the desire to save money overpowered quality. The good news is that some designers are slowly coming back to optical scaling. <BR> <BR>Another thing that was lost is the softness of the border between black and white. I think this might actually be the main reason letterpress is more readable (when done really well). I have a hunch that offset is simply too crisp, and our perceptive system cannot become very comfortable with such stark borders. I can think of one way to address this issue: unfocus the laser in an imagesetter (but microscopically). As an aside, I don't think either the randomness or the relief effect of letterpress are really important/positive. Randomness is lack of information, and we don't read with our fingers (unless it's Braille). <BR> <BR>And a third thing is trapping. In the metal days: a size couldn't be used larger, so traps would never become obvious/distracting; and bleed was greater, so trapping was more necessary. In digital, traps are still necessary much of the time, but not enough to &quot;register&quot; in the mind of most designers. Interestingly, phototype was really hazy so they actually used a lot of traps - and they even used thorns: the sharp protrusions at corners to help them keep their sharpness. Virtually nobody does thorns in digital type.  <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>But we've also gained a lot. Most of all <i>potential</i>, even though it remains largely unrealized. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant <BR> <BR>I've always been amazed by the lack of optical sizing in digital fonts. Not so much by the failure of most foundries to provide it, but in the failure of typographers to incorporate it in their routine design, especially so since the tools for creating even a basic rendering of optical scale by ranking weights was available quite early on. Fontographer was the most long lived of these, followed now by FontLab. <BR> <BR>In regard to letterpress, hey!!! The relief effect is much more cherished today than it was during most of the history of printing. Printers would do anything to get rid of it, calendaring the paper after printing, dampening the paper afterward, etc. But on randomness I will have to disagree. You are speaking of distortion caused during printing I assume.  <BR> <BR>Don't know if you knew this though. It has long been thought that randomness was deliberately incorporated into many of the typefaces of the early printers, up until the beginning of the type foundry and the standardization of casting production. New evidence on the DK-Type, attributed to Gutenberg, suggests that it is possible that the single letterforms may have been composites of variant letterform pieces put together in punch form and cast that way to mimick the natural variance of handwritten letterforms. <BR> <BR>Does this effect readability? Certainly the earliest printers must have thought it crucial to the potential readers (buyers) of their time to simulate as much as possible the handwritten word.

Perhaps it's personal preference, but I can certainly tell a difference between digital Bembo and the metal Monotype version in a copy of Fine Print (or one of Mr. Tufte's books) and I prefer the metal. Many foundries are now creating optical sizes, or at least text and display, as opposed to one homogenized font&ndash;a great improvment. <BR> <BR>I have a printed copy of your Caslon specimen and a copy of the 1924 G.W. Jones Caslon specimen. I'll have to take a closer look and compare the digital to metal. (Your Caslon specimen is very lovely, by the way.) <BR> <BR>Tell me this, Mr. Giampa. Frederic Goudy cut his own type, right? Did he anticipate the finer execution of printing that you expect? In other words, do you feel your digital versions of his types live up to his (Goudy's) expectations of his metal types? And please, this is no attack&ndash;I just want to know your opinion. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison</div>

I'm actually working on that issue with Pascal, a much more relevant face to study. But if Zapf didn't exagerate the concavity (and really every other feature that deviates from the &quot;orthonormal&quot;*) then that just means he <i>should</i> have! One interesting think about Optima is that it seems the concavity was originally a technical compensation (for fighting gain), and not a bone fide design feature! It's only when some boss at a font house liked the effect at large sizes that it became a &quot;feature&quot;. Ironic, considering it's the font's main attraction. <BR> <BR>* For example, overshoots (like in the &quot;o&quot;) have to increase the smaller the point size (I mean relatively, of course). <BR> <BR>** As per Lawson's &quot;Anatomy&quot; (I think). <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; I believe that all renditions of Californian do not offer optical sizes? <BR> <BR>Hey, you're &quot;Mr Lanston&quot;! So you tell me (I honestly don't know): Did the original metal Californian have optical scaling or not? Obviously I wasn't talking about the digital/photo derivatives. You said &quot;If you don't like ours, you don't like Californian&quot;, and I'm trying to see if this makes sense or not. <BR> <BR>If your stuff doesn't have optical scaling and you don't want to admit it, well don't get angry at me. Blame the paucity of the retail font market - that would be understandable. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>It's common knowledge that many digitizations of metal faces are too thin. Bembo is such a case; digital Bembo printed &quot;normally&quot; (offset) is anorexic compared to metal Bembo printed &quot;normally&quot; (letterpress). I'm not sure what Knuth was talking about, but if you really do believe that people should be listened to in proportion to the quality of the fonts they've actually produced, then all you have to do is look at Computer Modern to totally ignore Knuth. (But as I've said, I don't believe that myself.) <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>&gt;I put both thorns and traps in Worldwide, a newspaper text face. </i> <BR> <BR>And well done, too, Nick.  <BR> <BR>My implied point still stands; for the most part, thorns in phototype were a compensation for a photo problem. That problem no longer exists, so the general need for thorns in digital type also no longer exists. (Hrant seems to be implying, above, that today's digital designers are somehow lazier than their forebears for not including thorns in their designs. Perhaps this is not what he meant.) <BR> <BR>Nevertheless, there are specialized circumstances where they may still be of some value. <BR> <BR><i>&gt;&gt; How did they save money?  <BR>&gt;By making one (or at least fewer*) set of drawings, of course. </i> <BR> <BR>It should be noted that the initial impetus for the creation of the pantographic punchcutter was not to circumvent the process of optical scaling, as one might surmise from Hrant's rant. <BR> <BR>The primary reason for the development of the pantographic punchcutter was to allow a person who was not necessarily trained or skilled at punchcutting, to cut a punch by directly following a [much larger] drawing. The device reduced the artistic and mechanical skills that were previously required to interpret a designer's design and cut it very small on the end of a piece of metal. This opened the doors to increased productivity in converting paper designs into metal fonts.  <BR> <BR>The fact that one could cut different sizes from the same master was a corollary efficiency that some foundries leapt at, while others did not. Linotype, for instance, created separate drawings for every size. M. F. Benton sometimes made different drawings for different sizes of certain letters &ndash; those that could not be optically adapted by adjusting different parameters of the pantograph (or so I understand from conversations with Mike Parker, who studied Benton's drawings at the Smithsonian). <BR> <BR>So although the demise of optical sizes can be traced to the invention of the pantographic cutter, that was not the goal of its invention. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, I did try to sort of hint that the Benton boys were great. And I'm a big fan of &quot;intent&quot;.

I think the pantograph was a success because of its scaling more than anything else. The font houses that <i>didn't</i> use the pantograph's money-saving scaling went under [first]. <BR> <BR>&gt; Hrant seems to be implying, above, that today's digital <BR>&gt; designers are somehow lazier than their forebears <BR> <BR>Well, I don't know if that would be fair to say of the overall, but certainly contemporary designers seem to <i>push the available potential</i> less. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; a digital face will increase roughly 5% <BR> <BR>Only for a specific size (12?), because the gain is actually <i>absolute</i> (and typically on the order of one mil = 1/1000 inch). <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; FB Californian has 3 optical sizes <BR> <BR>Huh. <BR>GG, what about yours? <BR> <BR>BTW, Addison, this is just a little campfire - don't worry. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; when did [trapping] start? <BR> <BR>Well, I can tell you about the earliest one I [think I've] seen: in an &quot;R&quot; by Guillaume Le Be II. <BR>I saw it in a promotional booklet done by a Famous Type Designer, but when I asked him if he could provide me with the original scan/source of the image -because I was interested in the history of trapping- he refused on the grounds that I was seeing things. Unsurprisingly, this FTD doesn't put traps in his fonts, and is against the practice. Maybe he didn't want me to find out that his original model used traps but his &quot;revival&quot; didn't? Or maybe I <i>was</i> seeing things. He could have just shown me the original so we could figure it all out. Anyway, I'll find out eventually. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Paul: Right on!

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant <BR> <BR>The 5% I was talking about was not during the letterpress printing process, but a gain from neg to plate during the platemaking process. I read a technical report where it was suggested as 5%. This would be across the board and have nothing to do with the type size, but rather WHATEVER imaging was being transformed. <BR> <BR>Which brings up a question that perhaps both Nick and you can help me with. Since the film negative is photoexposed on to the plate material, would not a properly configured letterpress face not only have a weight reduction in its main strokes, stems, etc, the inclusion of ink traps, but but but, thorns as well? Or did the photofilm process require thorns because of camera distortion, different kind of lighting exposure, etc.? <BR> <BR> <BR>Gerald</div>
