body: "Anyone know if you can set up styles in Word with conditional font selection,
  similar to using the \"font-family\" attribute in CSS? I unfortunately have to design
  a document for a client in Word (for users with no typesetting experience) and would
  like to be a bit more lively with the typography. Thus, I'd like to be able to list
  a group of fonts in the style so that if a user doesn't have Font A or Font B, Font
  C will kick in...\r\n\r\nI'm dreaming, right?"
