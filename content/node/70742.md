  body: "Hello, All:\r\n\r\nI was just Googling for my old, old, old ex-employer,
    Visual Graphics Corporation, and I wound up at TypoPhile! Great to see there still
    a bunch of folks interested in the beauty of the letter, and the space that surrounds
    it.\r\n\r\nI used to install and repair VGC's Phototypositors back in the mid-70s.
    Unfortunately, when I left the company in 1977, I didn't keep anything as memorabilia
    or reference.\r\n\r\nBut thought I'd just drop in and say hello.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nDoug"
