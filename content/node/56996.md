  body: "This looks identical to a Font Bureau design, by Berlow, Pichotta & Highsmith
    for Vibe magazine called \"Vibration\" (or Vibration Gothic) (the Bold Compressed
    weight). It is shown in the Third Edition of their Type Specimen book, but I can't
    find it on their web site.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
