    dated ang generic?\r\n\r\nMaybe a bit more research in fonts would lead to something
    more surprising.\r\n\r\nOn page 6 you use a set of ornaments to separate the sections
    Publisher / Other titles... I'm just not sure that this oldish stuff expresses
    anything in relation to the contemporary music (modern minimalism) that Glass
    creates."

    are??\r\nThe Initial on page 3 not in helvetciaa light??\r\nthe ornaments are
    nice.. perhaps it can be used for seperates more content stuff on the text-sites
    (3-5)?\r\nthere are (at all) a mixed of two fonts. would it be a kindly cover

  body: "I think in genereal you need to pay a lot more attention to your body copy.
    If you are choosing to justify the text then you need to pay speacial attention
    to where you hyphanate words. \r\n\r\nIn the introduction 'collaboration' and
    'process' are hyphanated quite badly. When hyphanating words try to use the syllables
    within the word. 'collabor-ation' and 'pro-cess'. \r\n\r\nSomething else when
    justifying text is making sure that the tracking between each word is consistent.
    If you look at the third paragraph in the introduction, and compare the first
    sentence' tracking, compared to the last sentence' tracking, ending in 'Laurie'
    you will see that the word spacing is much tighter in the first and looser in
    the last. TO remedy this you need to play with taking words over, and taking words
    back from each line, and this is where the use of hyphans becomes important as
    they help to create an evenly coloured page. \r\n\r\nDue to the short line length
    you may find yourself adding many hyphans, here I suggest, that due to it being
    the introduction, there may be an opportunity to replace certain words with others
    that are of the same meaning but different lengths. \r\n\r\nI have just set a
    200 page book and that was justified, it took at least a full few weeks to go
    through it and tweak every line. \r\n\r\nJustifyling lines requires a lot of patience,
    as does all typesetting, but it is worth it in the end, gives you something to
    be proud about.\r\n\r\nGood luck\r\n\r\nMatt"
