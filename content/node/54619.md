  to make a poster out of it\r\nbut still I feel something is wrong........ There
  are some details supposed to be added later like phone numbers and address.... but
  still.......\r\n\r\nHow about the font and it's size? "

  body: The font used for "Arabic calligraphy gallery" doesn't really suggest calligraphy
    to me. Think about using a font that captures more of that "hand-written" aesthetic.
    Also think about reducing the size of the text for the gallery location and breaking
    it into 2 lines and centered. Also consider spelling out the dates (i.e. Feb should
    be spelled out as February). This will make it look and feel more formal. I don't
    know what your final poster size will be but also consider making a vertical list
    and centering the artists names  - almost like movie credits. Hope this helps.
