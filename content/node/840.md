  body: The first one is definitely <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/tango/">Tango</a>,
    not sure about the second but it should be relatively easy to find &#40;I just
    don&#39;t have the time at the moment&#41;. For 60s-era surf fonts, check out
    House Industries&#39; <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=TIKICD-FO">Tiki
    Type</a> collection.

    the sample was so small.

    target="_blank"> Goudy Heavyface</a>  <BR>and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cooper/black-italic-headline/testdrive.html?s=beach%26bikini%201979&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Cooper Black</a>. <BR> <BR>Sorry I can&#39;t be of much more
    help, but we haven&#39;t got  <BR>almost any affinity with surfer culture down
    here in Belgium.  <BR>The waves on the North Sea are quite unimpressive. ;&#41;

  body: Sure does have that Cooper Black flava in certain respects. Even the ampersand
    is extremely similar. But the numerals, the k, and the big loopy O strays pretty
    far. A Coop knockoff? Anyone have a specimen of Ludlow Black?

    just additional suggestions. <BR>Don&#39;t we Dangerboy?

  body: 'Yeah I guess I don&#39;t NEED an exact match - but if I could find that it
    would be great - but yes suggestions are very helpful as well - I was just trying
    to determine if I was going to have to customize a font to get that &#34;swooshing&#34;
    O or if there was a font out there as rad as this... <BR> <BR>And I&#39;m still
    very open to any more ideas for California/West Coast 70s/80s surfer fonts...just
    to give you guys an idea of what I&#39;m working with so far a few of the favs
    I&#39;ve been using are: <BR>Debussy, Opal, Answer, Rollerguide, Plush,Cookie/Cooper,
    Grease, Frankfurt, Hobo, and I even used Black Rose for one logo that turned out
    pretty sweet - I did find some others I&#39;m planning to snag soon - LazyBones
    &amp; the Tango font...so any more suggestions along these lines PLEASE hook me
    up! <BR> <BR>Thanks guys... <BR>The Danger'
