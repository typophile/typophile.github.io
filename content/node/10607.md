body: Hello folks, <BR>I&#39;ve tried everything to ID this font but it is evading
  me. The font is used on the logo of Royal Porcelain Thailand so could be custom-made&#40;?&#41;.
  You can see it in action on their website as well <a href="http://www.royalporcelain.co.th/"

  body: Closest I got was the Jason Walcott font Debonair &#40;Jukebox&#41; but it&#39;s
    not right either... :/

  body: Debonair is a revival of Roger Excoffon&#39;s &#39;Diane&#39;, and it does
    not have the looping l.  <BR> <BR>I think this is a slight modofication of Excelsior
    Script, which goes by several other names, depending on your sources.  Here is
    my sample using NovelFonts &#39;Ecstatic&#39;, which is no longer available, as
    far as I know. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70980.gif"

    target="_blank">&#39;Classic Script&#39;</a> is almost identical as you can see
    in this Test Drive and it is available. In this and the sample above, you would
    only need to add to the initial loops, and perhaps add a smidge of stroke thickness
    to be almost exact.
