body: "Hi. I just wanted to ask if any of you are familiar with this font that I've
  been looking for quite a long time already. I don't know what it's called. It looks
  like century gothic (even width of lines) with a serif, and the most distinctive
  letter is the capital 'O' because it has a cross in the middle. The font has this
  church-y, almost gothic feel to it. Hope you can help. Thanks. \r\n\r\nhttp://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c155/wingspread/o.jpg"
