  body: I like it. Bold and playful - bold in the non-fonty sense, that is. <BR> <BR>The
    strokes on the <b>e</b> seem a little thin on the sides.

  body: I think the top bowl of the g is a mite too small, especially in comparison
    to the lower bowl. It&#39;s also a bit skewed, not really upright; tutn it a degree
    or so clockwise... <BR>The e is a bit flat on the left side. Should be more like
    o. <BR>You also should normalise the bits where bowls meet verticals &#40;eg b
    is too much unlike a and u -- I mean the lower parts&#41;. <BR>All in all I think
    this is a very mature effort. Wish I could have done this!

  body: 'At first I didn&#39;t like this, but now it seems to be clicking for me.
    That &#34;g&#34; is quite nice for one thing. Speaking of which though, the descender
    depth for it is much greater than the rest - even greater than the ascenders.
    <BR> <BR>I guess the main thing about this design is that the stroke contrast
    is funny - it looks like it was mechanically squished in Illustrator or something.
    But I guess you want that as a feature, and that could very well be an interesting
    angle. Just know that when a type designer sees it in actual use he&#39;ll probably
    blame the setter and think: &#34;Another case of squishing, yuk!&#34;  :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>BTW, it seems to me that the &#34;s&#34; doesn&#39;t have enough of that
    effect. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Hi Hrant, <BR>you&#39;re right I have to rethink the contrast. I definitely
    don&#39;t want it to look &#34;artificially&#34; compressed. I was making the
    strokes mathematically the same weight instead of optically, but it d

  body: On the g, I think the top can be small as in the first posting. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/charlotte-sans/bold/testdrive.html?s=abcdefghiijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Charlotte Sans</a> has a small eye, and looks very good. Also
    it will give you more space to develop the loop, so it doesn&#39;t have to descend
    so much. The way you join the arches to the stems of hmn is interesting, but I
    would need to see a text setting to see how the letters work together.

  body: I think this typeface has some good things going for it. One thing that I
    noticed &#40;this may be intended, not sure&#41; is that the bowls look like they
    are about to fall off of the vertical strokes on the d, p, b, q etc. You may want
    to consider optically strengthening the connection by letting the counter cut
    into the vertical stroke. I hope this makes sense to you. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/55224.gif"

  body: I think you might indeed strengthen the connections &#40;maybe&#41; just as
    long as you don&#39;t go against -what I see as- the essence of this design, which
    revolves around a funky modulation. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Good points Hrant the , glad you like the name too! <BR> <BR>On the p, b,
    q, d I really had trouble making it work... it makes sense to cut across the vertical
    stroke, I&#39;ll try to make that and still keep the main features <BR> <BR>Hrant,
    by mushy g ear you mean that the curves are too soft, maybe that the connections
    should be corner-like? <BR> <BR>Also, do ya&#39;ll agree that the y is looking
    thinner than the rest of the glyphs? <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: I agree about not understanding irregularity of descender length.  <BR> <BR>As
    for the y, do the different strokes need to be such different weights. Maybe this
    is why it&#39;s reading weaker/thinner to you. I think the weight of the right
    stroke relates more to the other characters.  <BR> <BR>The s is the character
    that feels like least at home to me. Perhaps you could flatten the angle of the
    diagonal a little, and that would open up the transition into the curves.  <BR>
    <BR>The e also feels a little rounded out in comparison to the o,b,c,d,p,q. <BR>
    <BR>since we are speaking about the ear of the g, i feel the angle of it&#39;s
    end should relate better to the angle of r, a, c. Maybe not; maybe the ear exists
    more in the world of the cross of the f and t and t, and the end cut should remain
    vertical.
