body: "In order to aleviate the my mother from the unrelenting torture that is my
  sister's wedding, I've offered to design the wedding invitations. It's actually
  an interesting challenge. We are Dutch, living in the US, and the marriage is to
  a Scotsman. I would like the typography, however subtle, to reflect this. \r\nSo
  far, I\"m thinking of using DTL Renard as the Roman. I don't want to muddle the
  thing up with 3 typefaces. A Roman, a script and perhaps a few flourons to choose
  from. \r\n\r\nideas? suggestions?\r\n\r\n-chris"
