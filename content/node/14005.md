    in 1998 this was the plan (sort of). A note posted on my 'blog' from that era...\r\n\r\nU&lc
    cleared for take off\r\nNew York, NY. - 23 September 1998\r\nWhen ITC changed
    the format of the popular printed quarterly, company head Mark Batty stated that
    the Web version would be extended. U&lc editor John D. Berry and his team have
    followed through on that promise with articles that appear exclusively in the
    online version. By the time U&lc vol.25 no.2 hits the newsstands the online version
    will include online columns by Eileen Gunn, Olav Martin Kvern, and a mystery columnist.
    Expect new content to be posted on the U&lc site by the end of the week. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=44

  body: I see their website and it looks like any other crappy website. I mean do
    you think the quirky nature of articles like the longest word or the longest sentence
    could translate to the web, and the protraits done in type etc?

    still exists as an entity to inform and help educate readers who have an interest
    in typefaces and typography.\r\n\r\nIlene Strizver and Allan Haley are frequent
    contributors, and both remain dedicated educators and lovers of the craft. \r\n\r\nI
    believe what you are missing is the old irreverant playfulness inspired by Herb
    Lubalin. It wasn't quite the \"Monty Python\" of publications, but certainly more
    of the \"Smothers Brothers\" presentation of quality content behind the jokes
    and wisecracks.\r\n\r\nWhatever I do will be more about the U&lc phenomenon that
    had thousands of readers tackling mailmen for their quarterly issue. Also, a little
    bit about the affect it had on raising anti-piracy issues, licensing and royalties,
    inspired marketing techniques and what happens when you allow designers to have
    fun doing what they love.\r\n\r\nMore than likely it will start out as an expanded
    typowiki. Also, I have no authority to reuse or display copyrighted material,
    so I doubt that it would grow into an online archive.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nYes,

  body: As I see it, U&lc cannot translate properly onto the web because part of the
    experience of U&lc was seeing the printed page and how the letters interacted
    with that set page size. The web is limited in that way because if you want to
    look closely at a letter you zoom in and lose the surrounding area. However, with
    print you have the information in your peripheral vision still. I know this might
    sound wacky, but I have noticed that it is still more visually exciting to view
    things such as U&lc as they were intended to be viewed -- in all of their printed
    glory.

  body: "Tiffany, you are absolutely correct!\r\n\r\nI've started writing two articles
    on the U&lc Phenomenon; one as a review of the new <em>U&lc</em> book for Stephen
    Coles, and the other focusing on the impact ITC and <em>U&lc</em> had on the world
    of type.\r\n\r\nIn writing my drafts, I've described several factors that made
    U&lc such a unique publication and experience. In one, the very fact that the
    early editions were printed in black & white on newsprint, meant that layouts,
    type selections, illustrations and typography were presented in raw unadulterated
    print, with no reliance on stock, ink colors or higher lpi (lines per inch) halftones.\r\n\r\nSo
    there you had it, the most dynamic typographic layouts printed on cheezy newspaper
    offset. And that's how it was meant to be experienced, in it's purest form, like
    the actual da Vinci notebooks, or tablecloth drawings of Toulouse-Lautrec. The
    majority of the world can only see repros or facsimiles of the above, which lacks
    the very tactile quality of the originals. The experience is absolutely different.\r\n\r\nYes,
    yes, I know. Don't compare one-of-a-kind masterpieces with a magazine that had
    runs in the thousands. I said it was a draft, didn't I?\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"
