  \r\nOne I can think of is quite round in it's line form?  \r\nAny ideas?"

      \r\nA sans or serif, just has to be classy! A long extension would be great.

    body: Thanks for the suggestions. Stephen, I liked your options. I still really
      want to find out that typeface on the wallpaper cover. Pattyfab, definitely
      close with Sackers Gothic but slightly different. Anyone????
