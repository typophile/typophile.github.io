  is not helping <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
  BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m gonna pass this by you all, and see what you think. <BR>
  <BR>I very happy with the mark, we did that a short while back. It&#39;s the layout
  of the card I&#39;m having trouble with. <BR> <BR>The card is two color, PMS 7542
  &#40;a muted blue&#41;is used in the mark, in 100%, 80%, and 60%. The other color
  is a very dark gray. Faceplate sans &#40;two points to whoever points this out from
  an earlier &#39;rejected&#39; logo&#41; <BR> <BR>I should ad, Sogno &#40;pronounced
  sone-yo&#41; is a textile import company, similar to IKEA but, more focused in the
  &#39;bedroom&#39; side of the business. <BR> <BR>So feedback would be helpfull.

  body: Kyle, <BR> <BR>I like the mark as well, although I must admit that I thought
    it was a paper company. Perhaps some sort of pattern integrated into the mark
    or background to allude to fabric/textiles? Also, I believe textiles are commonly
    distributed in round or flat rolls &#40;imagine rolling up many many feet of fabric
    around something flat, like a yardstick&#41;. Just something to think about. <BR>
    <BR>In regards to the typography/layout/colors. While I like Faceplate sans, I&#39;m
    not sure its the best choice for a company that does textiles. To me this face
    is a little too modern/techie/impersonal for the purpose. I would say the same
    about the color scheme -- the muted blue is okay, but I feel that the gray is
    does not work. What about something a bit warmer -- more natural fiber looking?
    Something from the off-white to medium brown range? <BR> <BR>Just some top-of-mind
    feedback for what it&#39;s worth. <BR> <BR> -t

  body: 'Kyle, I like this. <BR> <BR>I kind of like Faceplate because it&#39;s kind
    of quirky and friendly but feels refined and modern enough. <BR> <BR>The mark
    is good, and I think you should stick with it. Pillows, rugs, curtains, and tablecloths?
    <BR> <BR>Tim&#39;s suggestion about the grey makes sense, but I haven&#39;t ever
    seen their range of product. A warmer grey almost brown could be pretty nice.
    Especially with the blue. Dark brown suit and a nice blue shirt.  Maybe they&#39;re
    too cool for brown. <BR> <BR>You may have tried all this stuff already so take
    it for what it&#39;s worth: <BR> <BR>What happens when you layout the card horizontally?
    Could you hang the mark in the left corner and stack info underneath the  sogno
    logotype aligned with the s? <BR> <BR>If you stay vertical what about aligning
    the information text with the imaginary centerline of the logo? <BR> <BR>Hang
    in there. Let us know what goes on. <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: Hi Kyle, I like the font and the logo and the colours very much. But I&#39;m
    not crazy about the while box right on top of the back of the card? Is it necessary?
    It seems to cut the card into two, and rather abruptly I feel. Would the design
    not be stronger without the white box? Just my two cents.  <BR> <BR>Be sure to
    post the final. <BR>

  body: Karen thats a really strong opion all ten times of it or so. Kyle, love the
    type but play with the layout some more, its so corporate. Maybe instead of printing
    the paper graphic you could stamp it or emboss it so it works on both sides of
    the card maybe even a diecut. Also think about using a textured paper. Its very
    stiff and needs to lighten up. Just my opion, Dan

    logo is totally a paper company. Try using a roll with a wavy sheet coming out.
    <BR> <BR>The other criticism I have is that the colors are a bit too muted. And
    what about putting a subtle background pattern &#40;as in fabric&#41; on part
    of the card? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Hrant I&#39;ve done work for paper companies If I see another paper roll graphic,
    I&#39;m going to puke. They all use it. But texture is good. I also agree about
    the colors, most paper companies want to show off the brightness of their papers
    and how the ink jumps off the page, subtle colors and full coverage defeat that
    goal. Kyle you might want to be PC and use one of their recycled papers for the
    card and have the symbol and the percentage of recycling. The card, like an annual
    report can do more than post an url or phone number. Dan
