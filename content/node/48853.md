  I expand the classes (to see how many pairs I have) I have 6500 pairs, is this a
  normal amount for a font or should I limit the amount of pairs."

  body: "I think it is rather much, but I dont think you have to worry for that matter.
    But perhaps you could look over the spacing a little bit, as this large number
    of kerning pairs could mean that the spacing is not optimized? Or... it could
    also mean that you really have kerned VERY good :)\r\n\r\n"

    the spacing is not good  :-)"

  body: "Who is they? Don't believe everything anybody said ...&nbsp;&nbsp;:)\r\n\r\nIn
    my reading the question was technical. In this respect, the given number of kerning
    pairs is really small. (I take for granted that the font is an OTF with a glyph
    set larger than in old PST1 fonts.)\r\n\r\nIf the question were about strategy,
    then of course one better try hard to create almost-perfect spacing so it needs
    as few kerning as possible.\r\n\r\nIf the question were about aestetics, then
    better let the design of the typeface decide, not what anyone said. Some typefaces
    need more, some need less kerning."

  body: "The font in question is an OTF font, I spent an age on the spacing so I hope
    it is correct. The kerning I did was to correct spacing that couldn't be achieved
    without the kerning.\r\n\r\nThe kerning I did was :\r\n\r\nUpper/Upper\r\nUpper/punctuation\r\nUpper/Lower\r\nLower/Lower
    (min)\r\nLower/punctuation\r\nNumber/Number\r\nNumber/punctuation\r\n\r\n  "

  body: I vote with Rachael. Even working over an old, well-fit Type 1 font, I'd get
    about 2000 pairs. Over half of these involved punctuation. A second observation
    is that however you set the sidebearings of capitals, either (1) cap-cap needs
    a lot of kerning, or (2) cap-lowercase needs a lot of kerning.

    I fully agree with both observations, about punctuation and spacing of capitals.\r\n\r\nBest
