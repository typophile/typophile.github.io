  the image below.  \r\n\r\nthe slanted e is a must, and the v and the a are also
  important!\r\n\r\n\r\nit would appear to be in the bauhaus family, but beyond that,

    is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=avant+garde\">Avant
    Garde Gothic</a> with <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=EF.101895.0.0\">Alternates</a>
    for the 'v' 'e' and 'T'.\r\n\r\nQuite a popular stumper, actually. (I think it's
    the alternates that throw people off.) But once you know it, it's hard to miss!"
