  on WinXP. These are the only real specs:\r\n\r\n- No metrics classes\r\n- No kerning
  classes\r\n- 2 kerning pairs only\r\n- dnom / numr feature\r\n\r\nHere's the code
  for the dnom/numr features:\r\n\r\nfeature dnom {\r\n    sub @dnom_normal by @dnom_ot;\r\n}
  dnom;\r\n\r\nfeature numr {\r\n    sub @numr_normal by @numr_ot;\r\n} numr;\r\n\r\nEverything
  compiles and previews just fine in FontLab, but when I try to generate the font,
  I get this:\r\n\r\nERROR: There was a problem while compiling OpenType font. Final
  .otf font is not saved. Please, check OpenType features definition for errors\r\n\r\nI
  can't seem to get any additional info on what's actually wrong, and the problem
  doesn't seem to be budging. The font is comlpetely finished at this point, so it's
  frustrating to not be able to build it.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated!"

    with an open contour. FontLab highlighted it in red, I fixed it, and the error
    went away. I'm still left with this strange and vague OpenType issue, however,
    and as a result my font is still "unbuildable".

    the generated OT font to be built. There may be an uncompleted build residing
    there with a goofball extension (look for something like \"[<em>name of your font</em>]._tf\").
    If so, remove it or rename the extension (try \"[<em>name of your font</em>]._tf_fail\")
    and then retry your generation effort.\r\n\r\nSuch quirky behavior struck me thrice
    only when using FLS 5.0.0 on Win2K and the above procedure cleared the problem.

    say I've ever had this one, but to check if it is true, save the features as has
    been recommended, then reset the features in the FontLab OT panel so there are
    none. If you can now make an OT font, then you know the problem is (most likely)
    in the features. \r\n\r\nAs I remember debugging 101, you add one thing at a time
    until you find the problem -- or alternatively, keep splitting the file in half
    until the problem is isolated. As has been suggested, by importing the features
    file, you can work in a text editor so you can see better, change file names etc.

    replacement basis, using classes only when it is absolutely impossible to avoid
    them. (Because debugging class errors is really close to reading uncommented ANSI
    C :)\r\n\r\nAnother idea: try to add the features directly to the already generated
    TTF - and regenerate it as OTF?\r\n\r\nAlso it is (funny, but yes, why not?) not
    a bad idea to restart the PC :) And maybe check with other versions of FontLab,
    even maybe do an upgrade, if it solves the problem... (If you have some old FL
    4.6, maybe it will provide hints where the problem is hidden). But at this stage
    the things are already becoming too heavy..."

  body: "Here is what I would do . . .\r\n\r\nTake an old Type 1 font you've used
    for years.\r\n\r\nRead it into FontLab.\r\n\r\nSee if you can make an OpenType
    font from it -- just read it in (make sure there are no parens in the copyright
    line) and see if you can generate an OT font.\r\n\r\nIf not, likely there is some
    problem with your installation of FontLab.\r\n\r\nIf so, the problems is likely
    with your font.\r\n\r\nIf it seems to be in your font, make a copy & throw away
    everything but  two letters -- the space and something else, say \"A\". See if
    you can make an OTF font. If not, remove the \"A\" and try a \"B\".\r\n\r\nIf
    this initial test doesn't work, you need a guru beyond me, but likely someone
    here can help.\r\n\r\nIf this test does work, make another copy of the and remove
    half the lettes, & see if you can generate the otf font.. If not, keep removing
    half the letters until you can. If it is a single letter, pretty soon, you will
    have it isolated. If it is more than one letter it will take longer; I'd use an
    \"addition\" rather than a \"subtraction\" procedure (i.e., keep adding to what
    works). \r\n\r\nOne thing you might try first is to make the OT-TTF font, read
    it back in, change the curves to PostScript, and see if THAT will let you generate
    an OT-CCF font. But my guess is it won't.\r\n\r\nGood luck"

  body: "This is not a feature file problem - note that Andy tried removing all features
    and had the same problem.\r\n\r\nAll that CFF subroutinization does is make the
    font file smaller. It does this by finding bits of contours that are common to
    several glyphs, and sharing that bit between them. Think composite glyphs, but
    sharing just parts of an outlines. With some fonts, this can make the CFF table
    as much as 50% smaller, although it is more common to see size decreases of around
    20-30%. It is rare to have a problem because of this; the bugs I know of happen
    when there are > 32K subroutines, and you usually run into this when you have
    > 10,000 glyphs. However, it does no harm to turn subroutinization off. The size
    difference of the final OTF font is usually don't matter on modern systems, unless
    you are targeting mobile device.\r\n\r\nThe approach suggested above by charles_e
    on 2.Nov.2007 6.13am seems the most practical. to me, although I'd do it the other
    way around; make a new font, then add the letters in gradually, then fix the FontInfo
    and other meta info to match the original, then add features.\r\n\r\n- Read Roberts"
