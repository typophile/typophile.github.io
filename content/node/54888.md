  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/firstcollageB_4120.jpg]\r\nI did this first,
  but I misunderstood the assignment. I needed to incorporate the letters into the
  page with the images. I put my letters on a separate page to make them look like
  a ransom note, which I think looks pretty neat.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newcollage_4381.jpg]\r\n
  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/newcollagepgtwo_5420.jpg]\r\nI had to do my
  new collages on two spreads because my images were so big, but I did what the assignment
  called for. I wanted one of them to have so white space. When I collage outside
  of class I avoid white space as much as possible so I was trying to break that habit.
  I like these because some of the images aren't so obvious. You kind of have to think.\r\n\r\nCan
  you guess my letter? "

    things down on paper. Graphic design that has no content always leaves me feeling
    slightly empty.\r\n\r\nAlso look into grids for layouts (www.thegridsystem.org
    is a good start) as it will give you a lot more control when piecing different
    elements together. I always wish someone had told me about them earlier!\r\n\r\nGood
    luck with your course."
