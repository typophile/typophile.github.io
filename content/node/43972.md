  body: "This tip is not going to be as helpful as a proper plug-in, but in a pinch
    you can export text from your master as Adobe Tagged Text format. This will create
    plain text marked up with your styles, and at the head is a complete definition
    of all styles. You'll need to learn to decipher and wade through all the Adobe
    Tagged Text syntax (exporting as \"verbose\" rather than \"abbreviated\" makes
    it a little easier to decipher).\r\n\r\nNot ideal, perhaps, but maybe better than
    having to take a bunch of notes by hand.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
