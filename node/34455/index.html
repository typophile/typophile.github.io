<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I am working on a redesign of one of my first fonts (Tirana released by T26). I feel that this fonts has flaws as it was my first. Since I feel strongly enough about it, I’d like to make something better of it, so I am redrawing it and expanding it’s weights. I think it is improving lot to the point of starting to become a different font, although the basic characteristics like the curves and proportions, which were my main motivation for going back to this font, are kept. I think this is a common feeling among type designers, if you were in the same situation, what would you think would be best the best way to release it? Releasing it with the same name and adding it something like “pro” or “new”? Releasing it with a different name and assume it is a new font? Not going back to it at all?
You can see attached a sample of the new upper cases.
Thank you in advanced.

<div class=commentbody>Hi Rui,
Why don't you release an OpenType version of Tirana, calling it TiranaPro, with smallcaps, ligatures, swashes, and then you can add the new glyphs you designed into that font and allow people to use them as alternates.
I don't mind to give you some guidelines in order to achieve that.
Abraço,

That is a good idea and I am working on smallcaps and ligatures (not swashes, I don't think it would fit) as I am expanding the font. The thing is: I'm trying to achieve a new level of coherence in Tirana more suitable for corporate use, so I'm redrawind every glyph so that every form gets smoother and the amount of ideas combined in the same typeface gets smaller.

<div class=commentbody>If you think it's a different font now, only keep the old name if it has value with users. In fact, if that's the case you might do that even if the new font is totally different! :-) Renner released fonts called Futura which looked nothing remotely like Futura.

<div class=commentbody>On a sidenote: I don't particularly like the changes to the G, K, and R I like your off center K, it has more character, same with the original G that has that nice little spur, and that R, it's not perfect but you tweaked the life out of it. Your new letterforms are getting too clean, they're starting to look like all the other common corporate sans you find these days. </div>

Where I agree, I don't necessary see the point in completely redesigning every letterform. Why would I pick Tirana if I can pick from a number of other sans that all have the same characteristics?
You need something to diversify your font from the herd. It doesn't have to be innovative, but it does have to be distinctive. </div>

I completely agree, but distinction can be found in details as well. All I'm saying is that I like the font the way it is now regardless of whether or not it resembles other existing fonts. I think by designing something yourself, you'll obviously be inspired by a certain amount of things, but you'll always end up with something unique (unless ofcourse you're literally copying a design). Important to keep in mind when judging Tirana is that it's a "remake" of Rui Abreu's first font which also already featured many of the characteristics that resemble the new herd.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, my main motivation was to narrow the amount of ideas on this font making it more corporate and clean, trying to achieve more coherence and universality.
My Idea is to polish it and clean it to make it a corporate font, even if it starts looking like other corporate fonts, I guess that is a necessary consequence.
I agree with Tom, “distinction can be found in details as well”.
I think “genitalia” will get more shinny and polished and, hopefully the same size 

If you have a corporation lined up to pick it up, sure. But there's a limit to how bland you can make it before an "out-of-the-blue" corporation becomes much more likely to simply go with another similar design, with even more polish! What I mean is, unless you put an inordinate amount of polish on this (I'm talking about multiple weights, widths, all kinds of extras), a "special look" is what will sell it best to a corporation.

<div class=commentbody>I'm just concerned you might be heavy handed with the polish. Some of the uniqueness of the original is being buffed out completely in the newer version and it would be nice to reconsider going back and lightening up on how smooth or polished you'd want some of those characters to be. The originals weren't overly quirky. I'm worried you might be creating some dead fish.
I will say that the majority of your newer characters are well done and definitely rise above the older ones.
Try revisiting your G,K,R, and B and see if you can hint back to their original styles while maintaining the clean look the other characters have now.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's an interesting question. For me the thing that stands out about the font is the way you handle curves - the C obviously but also the 3 & so on. They have a nice tension & invention about them. To make a the redesign worthwhile I would try to find a way to make the other glyphs with straight lines inherit some subtle shift and maybe tension as well. To me the glyphs don't quite all relate as a group yet - in either set. I think they need to. You could loose the weirdness even more but I think that would be a shame. The shift I mean doesn't have to be huge. Just there - & helping the letters to belong to each other. If you are not sure how to do that yet; I would wait until you are & then finnish a version 2.0 You are clearly developing the sensitivity you need to do it. I think you can.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It depends on the corporation. If you are trying to make the next uber-ubiquitous sans you are already off to the wrong start. If you want to make a sans that a telecom might license you are doing fine! It would be cool if you had the bottom Jut out a bit more maybe. I thought of a treatment for the A. Do you want to hear it?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hopefully the squiggliness of the red lines is enough to make the suggestion clear without it being too specific or prescriptive. I did start to muck with the A as well. If you like any of the the ideas feel free to use them.

<div class=commentbody>Yes, I see what you mean. this is exciting. I think your suggestions bring a really nice tension on the straight lines. Maybe they are a bit extreme to me, for now at least, but are making me want to work more on this tense curves and opposite/complementary tension of the stokes. I will continue on the rest of the font, with this new ideas in mind, so that I can get back to the uppercases with more congruence.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I do like the newer version of this face very much. Although it appears more 'corporate', I think it retains a very subtle impression that retains the character you were acheiving in the first version.
My notes would be to keep what you have here, but perhaps reconsider the following glyphs:
G, R, 1, 2, 4
G: I think if you include the spur from the original (but not the arm), it'd add what's possible missing to the G.
R: I feel this character falls out of balance with P. Perhaps consider using P as the basic form the new R? It appears to slightly fall out of balance with the rest of the face.
1: I prefer the angle of the original - as it now matched the 6's new angle.
2: I like the suggestion above - perhaps de-emphasis the bottom.
4: As noted above, perhaps emphasise this character as it would 'match in' better with the rest of the numeral set.
And sorry all the mistypes - but I've been up for around two days straight again on my own project. I won't even bother trying to spell-check at this stage.
I like this new version of your typeface though! Very nice. Very subtle. Subtle is a beautiful thing.

<div class=commentbody>And PS: I can say that I like this better then DIN. The subtle charm simply pops out at me, while retaining a very sophistocated approach.
Or at least, I see it being like a little cousin to DIN, that's all grown up and blossomed.
(Okay, when I start getting into odd analogies and talking about blossoming, then I know I need sleep.)

<div class=commentbody>“Or at least, I see it being like a little cousin to DIN, that’s all grown up”
Yes, is sometimes feel that Din is operating at the back fo my mind, not because I like it though.
