  body: 'Hey, thanks. That clears that up. Too bad it&#39;s shareware: unfortunately,
    I can&#39;t get a &#34;good copy&#34; since this is all there is.  <BR> <BR>I
    thought perhaps I just had the italic of some font, and was hoping to buy the
    complete font with roman, italic, bold, etc, but it turns out this is the whole
    thing. So.... <BR> <BR>Does anyone know of any higher quality, non-shareware fonts
    that look similar to this? I will be eternally grateful. <BR> <BR>za'
