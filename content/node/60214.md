  body: "Akzidenz-Grotesk\r\n\r\nEDIT: nevermind, jumped at it a bit too soon. Hold
    on a sec.\r\n\r\nEDIT2: The title looks an awful lot like AG, but the two-story
    g in the paragraph below suggests otherwise. I feel kind of embarrassed to be
    stumped by this one, because I know it's sitting right in front of me.\r\n\r\nEDIT3:
    Got it! It's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/trade-gothic/|Trade Gothic]].
    (Title is Bold no. 2, rest is regular)"
