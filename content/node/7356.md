body: Hi Guys <BR> <BR>I wondered if anyone knows how long an Atypi membership normally
  takes to process. I faxed them with a join form a week ago, and haven&#39;t heard
  anything. I emailed them yesterday to check they got the fax ok, I haven&#39;t had
  a reply yet... <BR> <BR>I am not in a rush or anything, just a little nervous of
  faxing my credit card details to New York and not hearing anything back. I mean
  with the amount of cash I have on that card, they could have been drunk on really
  cheap cider all week! <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>===

    conference, so that might account for the delay. I&#39;m in pretty much daily
    contact with the secretariat, so I&#39;ll mention your query to them Jim.

  body: Ah, the secret handshake is only for second degree novices, you&#39;ll begin
    with the secret looking askance. When you reach the higher degrees, you will be
    able to project your membership number directly into another member&#39;s mind
    in the typeface of your choice.

    an analysis of recommended typography textbooks, including a list-discussion summary
    of sorts. If you were an educator AND a member of ATypI you could participate
    in forming such documents, and of course members get consistent and speedy access
    to any proceedings. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Nice document. I especially like reference to McLuhan &#34;The Medium is the
    Massage&#34;. Stimulating. Walter Tracy and Bruce Rogers also need to have their
    names corrected. <i>The</i> Counterpunch? Yikes, no proofreaders. &#40;Yes, Hrant,
    I realize you aren&#39;t responsible for it. And stop staring at me.&#41;
