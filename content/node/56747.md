body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am restoring an old Reg Harris bicycle and am recreating the transfers.
  I've artworked most of them now, but am having problems identifying the fonts (have
  spent rather too long looking and can't really see the wood for the tree...)\r\n\r\nThe
  first font is for the model name (Record in my case, but I believe it's the same
  as this one): \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Reg_Pro_toptube_decal_3973.JPG]\r\n\r\nThe
  second font is from the crest on the seat tube (\"Reg Harris Cycles Ltd England\"),
  this one is driving me particularly crazy because I'm sure it's obvious, but I can't
  seem to get it (it's a basic grotesk of some sort...)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Reg_Pro_seattube_decal_1_5721.JPG]\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance for all help,\r\n\r\nCrispin Jones"

  body: The gold outline makes <em>Professional</em> tough to decipher, but <em>Reg
    Harris (Cycles) Ltd.</em> is done in the style of Edward Johnston's 1916 alphabet
    for the London Underground, and <em>England</em> looks like the same thing, but
    slightly bolder and more condensed.

  body: Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't think Johnston is right - the aperture
    on the "R" is too small on Johnston...
