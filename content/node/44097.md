  night?\r\n\r\nI thought Hoefler was very interesting and though I was aware of most
  of the faces he covered it was quite insightful to hear him talk in detail about
  them. Most of what he said was on the theme of conservation, which is an interesting
  angle. Though he admitted it was a talk he often gives with Frere-Jones (who wasn't
  there) it still seemed quite relevant. I suppose it's quite difficult to dislike
  the man anyway.\r\n\r\nI was amazed that one bloke got up and got Hoefler to sign
  an autograph!\r\n\r\nAs for Froelich, well, I shoudn't say too much. I thought the
  magazine she art directs for the NY Times that she talked about was quite mediocre.
  In fact, don't get me started on the fractur T!\r\n\r\nI wondered if anyone else
  had any thoughts?"
