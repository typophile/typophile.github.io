  MyFonts, so this family is soon available:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SuomiSlab_3613.png]\r\n\r\nIt
  has six weights with optically corrected obliques. Attached also a more comprehensive
  pdf.\r\n"

    Slab Serif looks an excellent face in its own right.\r\n"

  body: "Hello, Paul-\r\n\r\nIt's \"Close, but no Cigar\", because in small point
    sizes you might confuse it with American Typewriter, but at closer look you'll
    see it's totally different.\r\n\r\nThat was the idea behind Suomi Slab; to have
    those Clarendon features, so prominent on (in?) American Typewriter, but to go
    as far away as possible from the round, polished and slacking forms of American
    Typewriter.\r\n\r\nAnd thank you for your comment. I'm pretty proud of this one."
