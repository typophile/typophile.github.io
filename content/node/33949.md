    context. How about some more settings and glyphs? \r\n\r\nOn another note\u2014
    I'm scared of your website. :) "

  body: "The second image is fantastic. In the right context this face would work
    beautifully.\r\n\r\nI'm not as keen on the heavier weight though; It feels clumsy
    and not as refined. The swashes don't flow from the letter as nicely either (e.g.
    the t).\r\n\r\nI would really like to see one of the letters (perhaps the 'G')
    up close to get a feel for the detail.\r\n\r\nSorry I don't have anything more
    helpful to say.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, how did you start the design process?
    Did you use a pointed nib?"

  body: "It\u2019s a very nice take on the vein of Velvet and Porcelain. Your majuscules
    are absolutely gorgeous, and your normal specimen sheet is pretty easy on the
    eyes as well.\r\n\r\nDo the end-user a favor and add in alternate versions of
    the filled-counter minuscules that aren\u2019t filled in. There are times when
    having the counter filled just doesn\u2019t work. If you really have the time,
    it would be great to do filled and unfilled versions for everything to make the
    whole font more versatile."
