body: "i'm designing the back of a postcard for a tech client's IBC tradeshow party
  in Amsterdam.\r\nAfter sending the layout, which is sophisticated and euro simple
  she asked for - \r\n\r\n\"funky splatter text and all skewed\" \r\n\r\nand she said
  it 2x, so she's adamant.\r\n\r\ndoes any typeface like that or look and feel come
  to mind?\r\n\r\nthat's still sophisticated and euro?\r\n\r\nthe copy is something
  like this so you get a sense of how much to make splattery and skewed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIP

    all set."

  body: A good compromise might be to skew the text, but keep it clean, and add a
    texture overlay in front and behind it. Sounds like she wants it to look "exciting"
    wooooo.

    Degrading</a>\r\n\r\n\"First drawn in 1993 by Tobias Frere-Jones for Neville Brody\u2019s
    Fuse magazine, Reactor FB combines abraded forms with Tesla\u2019s theory of destruction
    through accumulating rhythmic points of noise. The \u201CDerelict\u201D style
    offers choices of eroding framework for each character. In Degrading, each letter
    flings soot and smut at its stark neighbors until accumulating flecks build up
    a roaring vibration that can overwhelm the outlines; FB 1996\""

  body: "thanks guys!\r\ni combined all of your thoughts and ended up with 2 options,
    as we providers like to do. one helvetica cy light - skewed it with different
    gradations of grey and the other one, i handwrote / scanned and placed some funky
    line drawings in there and played with curves. client seems very excited. thanks
    for your thoughts.\r\n\r\n"
