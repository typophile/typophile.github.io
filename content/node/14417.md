  body: Pre-digital Hobo Black formed a nearly closed lower loop in the S like that,
    but I'm unaware of any digital version. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=UR.109876.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=SA&sampleSize=288&attributes.paraSize=14&paraSize=14"
    target="_blank">Hobo Bold</a> might get you a bit closer, though, as far as the
    general weight and the counter in the A are concerned.
