body: "Hi guys,\r\nToday's question comes from my font Mixteca (you can see in the
  Crit section) where I'm developing a couple of new weights. I know the spacing/kerning
  on the base weight isn't quite perfect yet, but I'm wondering if the metrics can
  be successfully applied to the bold and the thin. What I'm thinking is to copy the
  metrics exactly, then add +10 (for instance) to the bold and -10 to the thin.\r\n\r\nReasons
  for: glyphs have same architecture, serifs and heavy strokes in the same places,
  kerning pairs should be the same.\r\n\r\nReasons against: different weights have
  been drawn optically so widths of glyphs are not consistently scaled. \r\n\r\nI
  suspect the answer might be that the only way to tell is to test it, but I'm wondering
  if anyone would care to share experience of spacing different weights? I couldn't
  find any info on spacing different weights in the resources I have. Any pointers?
  \r\n"

    like /H/O/n/o without reference to the original spacing, and then compare and
    see if you can draw any conclusions.\r\n\r\nI think relationship to the counters
    is key for letterspacing, so a quick question to arise is what has happened to
    your counters in your drawing the other weights?"

  body: "I use the same spacing for all the weights, normally applying a bit more
    space (\u2248+10) to the thiner weights and a a bit less (\u2248\u221210) to the
    bolder weights \u2013 that is because it helps to the boldness of the typeface:
    if spacing is added, the font looks lighter. Of course, you need to test if the
    spacing added or deleted is the ideal amount and some modifications must be applied
    to some glyphs.\r\n\r\nAs for the kerning, I start with the same pairs for all
    the weights, but often the bolder weights need more kerning pairs since the glyphs
    are closer, and some pairs of the thiner weights look a bit odd (excessive in
    some pairs, not sufficient in others). In short: it is a helpful starting point."

  body: "> I think relationship to the counters is key for letterspacing\r\n\r\nIt's
    interesting because for Mixteca I've had to narrow the letters of the Thin to
    make them look the same size (I guess otherwise the counters are too big), which
    made me want to reduce the letterspacing too. Conversely, the bold had to be widened,
    and that made me open up the letterspacing. This is a hard game ;)"

  body: "I now create a Thin, Regular, and Extra Bold, which I space and kern manually,
    then interpolate the other weights.\r\nThe Ultra/Black may require its own treatment.\r\n\r\nI
    think the reason is that notan plays more of a role in the middle weights, where
    the balance and rhythm of positive and negative is crucial, whereas in the extreme
    weights (which are more \"display\" anyway) the role of proximity between glyphs
    plays a greater role.\r\n\r\nThese are quite different spacing strategies. Helvetica,
    for instance, is tightly fitted at the extreme weights, but more open in the middle."

  body: Be very careful when you add new kerning pairs or fine-tune existing ones
    in ready weights. Even if you have consistent spacing between your weights, small
    random differences in kerning will shift bigger portions of text.

  body: "1)\r\nSo, when you have, say, Thin and Black as frames for your design, with
    acceptable metrics and kerning, you can get every other weight by linear interpolation.\r\n\r\n2)\r\nBut
    when you make bigger adjustments in design - and spacing - of the interpolated
    weight, the lines change into curves.\r\nSo, after next interpolation, \"linear\"
    letterspacing must be adjusted according to the curve.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/del2_4850.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs
    you can see, the more interpolations, the more similarity between the curve and
    lines. Spacing of DemiBold and DemiBlack in my example probably wouldn't need
    any changes. \r\n\r\nAnd now, when having the structure of our family, we start
    making changes to the kerning independently, we'll get a wavy output, where every
    weight has it's own, random line length."

  body: "What Nick said. You have to check the spacing of the middle weight too. Not
    only because the relationships have changed but also for mechanical reasons.\r\n\r\nTake
    a run-of-the-mill sans-serif for example.\r\n\r\nThe angles of the AKVXWkvwy will
    likely change from heaviest to lightest. It's especially relevant in glyphs with
    diagonals. Even if you've adjusted the spacing and kerning for the heaviest and
    lightest weights, the transition of the negative space between some glyphs is
    not always linear.\r\n\r\nThe way the heaviest L or T fits with other glyphs is
    different than the way the lightest L or T fits with other glyphs. When you tuck
    a fat L into an O, there's a sharp corner and some negative shapes to deal with.
    With an ultralight, there's no sharp corner, just a line. If you don(t give it
    an extra kerning tuck, the gap hay look too wide. In my experience, the transition
    between weights for these situations is rarely linear.\r\n\r\nUltralights have
    problems that medium and heavy weights don't have. Periods, commas and quotes
    are hard to discern in an ultralight. A bit more space can help make things clearer.
    But a medium weight doesn't really have the same problem. The periods, commas
    and quotes are quiet easy to discern. If you rely on a linear transition for the
    medium weight, the spacing of these glyphs may seems too loose."
