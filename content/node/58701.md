  body: Unfortunately, this appears to be hand lettered.  Look at the "e"s in particular.  They
    are different.  If it would be a typeface, they would be identical.

  body: "Just a thought... if I, as a lettering artist, were to have done this I would
    have had the \"cross bar\" of the L follow the arc.\r\n\r\nI actually think it
    is a font, or started as one. Plus the D's are identical... even tho they are
    different sizes.\r\n\r\nBut ya know, I could be wrong : )\r\nMichael"

  body: "Hey Rocky,\r\n\r\nI also think it's a font, with opentype there are a lot
    of possibilities\u2014\u2014alternates, ligatures, connection strokes\u2014\u2014check
    \"house industries\" and the movies of the \"Robothon\" conference. But back to
    the font, it doesn't really matter if it's written or a font because it's not
    that good. It's really inconsistent in spacing, kerning, connection-strokes and
    countershapes. But I do think it's a font, a writer that spends time learning
    this should know the basics that would not result in this."
