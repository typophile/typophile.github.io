  type?\r\n\r\nBeing a bit of a novice to ebay I just missed out on buying it, but
  I'd appreciate any suggestions of similar very condensed sans serif's from this
  era. I've checked out Knockout, Alternate Gothic, Garage Gothic, Compacta, FF Kipp,
  Railroad Gothic, Block Gothic, Balboa, Champion Gothic.... but still not quite feeling
  the love.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDom"
