  as a negative font, i have 5 classes, on positive, one negative, then positive that
  has bite taken off from both sides, bite taken off only from right side, and last
  one bite taken off from left side.\r\n\r\nI have done a simple script that substitutes
  every other letter to negative when there are 2 positive letters next to each other.
  Now what i want is to get the first letter always be all positive or bitten off
  by right side depending if it has a round letter next to it, or not. and middle
  ones as well totally negative letters or bitten off both sides. My time is running
  out, and no help what so ever.  Well, ask me anything, if you did not understood.
  \r\n\r\nSincerely, Nele"

  body: "I have done a fair bit of substitution coding, but I cannot understand what
    you are trying to do.\r\nSo how do you expect anyone to help you?\r\nWell, I could
    understand if I tried really hard, but why should the reader bother if the writer
    doesn\u2019t?\r\n\r\nAs a piece of design communication, your post gets an F.\r\nThe
    principle here is more important than the project: never let your guard down\u2014as
    a designer everything you do must be a professional-quality communication. (Until
    you become as successful as David Berlow.)\r\n\r\nShow an image of what you are
    trying to do (we are designers \uFB01rst, not programmers!)\r\nPost a link to
    your font.\r\nAnd although English is not your \uFB01rst language, so what? If
    you are posting in English, make your grammar and spelling perfect\u2014which
    will help everyone reading, whether or not English is their first language."

    it would have been apparent that there is no such word in English as \u201CIm\u201D.\r\nAlso,
    I would imagine that sentences always begin with a capital letter in Estonian.\r\nIt\u2019s
    a typographer\u2019s responsibility to be be picky about spelling and grammar.\r\n"

  body: "I wasn\u2019t just picking on Nele for language, that just happened to be
    one of several de\uFB01ciences in the original post.\r\n\r\nYou know, I read that
    post, and tried to \uFB01gure it out, but I couldn\u2019t, so I thought, why should
    I have to work so hard to help someone else, when they are a design communicator
    and do such a poor job of engaging me visually and helping me to understand their
    problem?\r\n\r\nThe language wasn\u2019t really an impediment (very minor errors),
    but rather an issue of a lack of typographic care, which I thought I\u2019d mention,
    because the thoroughness of communication is insidious\u2014if your attitude is,
    \u201Coh this aspect isn\u2019t important, I\u2019ll just rough it,\u201D that
    will come back to bite you.\r\n\r\n"

    you put <em>all</em> the negative letters into one class, and likewise all the

    didn't bother me that much. But, like you, I just couldn't visualise the point.
