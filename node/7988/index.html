  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am interested in mid-20th century typography and design, and am looking for a good, representative collection of faces from the era, from 1937's Coronet up to about Nov 1963: Murray Hill, Futura, Park Avenue, Balloon Extrabold, Gillies Gothic Bold, etc. <BR> <BR>I use Linux exclusively: GIMP for Web-based graphic design and TeX for print-based typesetting. I want to use the fonts primarily in GIMP, for Web work, but I'd also like to be able to use them occasionally with TeX, for the purpose of printing cards, letterheads, and the like. <BR> <BR>Can anyone recommend a source for these fonts, and a format (PostScript Type 1, TrueType, etc) that will work for me?</div>

  
   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">For use with TeX, I stick with Type 1, although you can use TrueType and with some pain, OpenType as well. Installing the fonts for use with TeX is not trivial, but it isn't quite so bad, if you read the excellent <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Type1fonts/fontinstallationguide/fontinstallationguide.pdf">TeX font installation guide</a>.  <BR> <BR>As for where to buy the fonts, I usually buy from Adobe, Linotype, FontShop, etc. Avoid the generic rip-offs, though.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, that's exactly the information I was looking for! <BR> <BR>I prefer to use Type 1 because they seem to work easy in X; once installed, GIMP and other applications just magically have them. <BR> <BR>Most foundries only seem to offer Mac and Windows options. I suppose Type 1 fonts for Windows on CD or downloaded will work on Linux? <BR> <BR>Just found some of the beautiful old faces I'm looking for available from Linotype.com. Happy to see them but guess I'm a little surprised at the prices for some of these 70-year-old typefaces. A <a href="http://www.linotype.com/89150/gilliesgothic-family.html">single 4-font family</a> will set you back $80-100&mdash;the cost of doing business for a commercial publication, surely, but it seems a little impractical for hobbyists and free-lance part-timers! <BR> <BR>I'd love to see them sold in packs, like how <a href="http://fontdiner.com/">Font Diner</a> does it. They sell new fonts with a &quot;retro&quot; aesthetic&mdash;I haven't tried them yet but the quality seems good, and you can get about a dozen for $30.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, you will want the PC Type 1 fonts.  <BR> <BR>For buying Linotype faces, often the more you buy, the cheaper the prices. (Just add more to your cart, and the prices update.) Unfortunately, that's not the case with all the fonts, though. I'd love to get Optima Nova, but not enough people are beating down my door with freelance jobs for me to afford it.</div>

These prices vary depending on the theme and on the fonts themselves: <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/6-1788-6/compilationvaluepackages.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.linotype.com/6-1788-6/compilationvaluepackages.html">http://www.linotype.com/6-1788-6/compilationvaluepackages.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>We don't offer discounts for amateur use,* but we do have a 30% discount in place for students. And as Steve mentioned, we offer bulk discounts on individual weight purchases. <BR> <BR>Sometimes, when a new value pack is released, its initial sales price is only around $30. If you sign up for the Linotype newsletter, you can get these special announcements mailed to you every month. <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/webshop/newsletter.php" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.linotype.com/webshop/newsletter.php">http://www.linotype.com/webshop/newsletter.php</a></a> <BR> <BR>Or, you can periodically peruse the News section here on Typophile.

		<div class="commentbody">Dan, appreciate the links. I took note of the many themed Value Packs, and wonder if Linotype would ever consider releasing Packs of fonts collected by time period? <BR> <BR>I'd like to improve my collection with a concern for quality and authenticity over quantity&mdash;but this being an amateur operation (at least for now, anyway), I'm on a tight budget. I have the basic PostScript printer fonts, all of the fonts that come with teTeX, and some of the extra CTAN fonts. Can anyone recommend other sources for obtaining good Level 1 fonts&mdash;particularly mid-century&mdash;on a budget? <BR> <BR>I keep reading about the Bitstream 500 font CD and the 250 font CD, and they're recommended in both the comp.fonts FAQ and the Linux Font HOWTO, but these CDs no longer appear to be available by Bitstream, nor do they show up used on eBay. <BR> <BR>One source I did find that offers a collection of type scanned from vintage sources is the <a href="http://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/PROPDOCS/PropFonts.html">HPLHS Prop Fonts</a> CD, and I wonder if anyone here has seen it.</div>
