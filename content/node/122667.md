body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI just completed a large document (288 pgs) in In-Design
  6 and tried to publish it to PDF.  I know you heard this before.  Adobe refused
  to embed the font, which of course is mandatory.  The font is a TTF created in 2001.\r\n\r\nI
  have written permission to use the font commercially and need to find a way to legally
  remove the do-not-embed restriction.  I contacted the creator of the font, and he
  did not realize he even put in the restriction and does not know how to remove it.
  \ He does not even have the program he used to create the font.  Yikes!\r\n\r\nChanging
  the font would take weeks even though I only use it in chapter heads and drop caps.
  \ I am also afraid outlining would put things out of wack.  It needs to work in
  print and in multiple electronic forms.\r\n\r\nI have scoured the web and have tried
  all sorts of apps.  Some did not work, and I could not even figure out how to use
  a few others.  \r\n\r\nAny ideas on how I can get myself out of this fix?  I get
  addicted to fonts and will resist changing it since it so perfectly relates to the
  subject matter of the text.\r\n\r\nHelp.\r\n\r\nsuzanneski\r\n\r\n"
