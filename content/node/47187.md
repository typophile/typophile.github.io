  to have a do-it-yourself (install) vibe as well as appear classic and reputable
  (company has been around for 30+ years).  Any font suggestions? '

  body: "How about <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_letter_gothic_text/\">Letter
    Gothic Text</a>?\r\nIt's a proportional version of a monospace style.\r\nSo the
    idea is it has a kind of technical \"code\" vibe, but at the same time it sets
    very smooth and compact.\r\nFor more personality in display, you could match it
    with one or more of my monospace-unicase <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/panoptica.html\">Panoptica</a>
    styles. Pixel might be good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Great suggestions, thanks.  I checked out your site and think Panoptica styles
    would add personality.  Would you be able to suggest a serif font that would mesh
    well with Letter Gothic Text for areas that are copy heavy?\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: "Officina is similar, and has sans and serif versions, but the Light weight
    of Letter Gothic is really nice, and Officina doesn't have that.\r\nSo perhaps
    Serifa would be a good companion? That would work with Panoptica Egyptian.\r\n"
