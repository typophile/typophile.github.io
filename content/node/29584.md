    showed up on the page. OK! I see that is for candy. What kind of candy? Is this
    adult candy? Pre-school candy?"

  body: "It's definitely got a sort of Middle Eastern / Aladdin feel to it. If this
    is what you're going for, then it's working.\r\n\r\nA couple of things - the crossbar
    on the 'T' and the middle bar of the 'E' are a little too thick. The bowl of the
    'R' seems a little light. Also, the 'C' seems to plain. Try giving it a little
    spur like the 'S' has.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: hmmmm, now i think the type looks too like some ethnic cuisine restaurant
    etc. i think there needs to be colour in there for kids to be attracted to it
    and all bubbly, fun, exciting and colourful. don't know if the others agree though.
    It's not exciting enough for kids. sorry but if it was older than 18 and for a
    restaurant or some ethnic food place like take away but without stars, then it
    seems ok but as its not for them, i think you need to see other companies selling
    sweets/candy and see how they are attracted. go and stand in a sweet shop and
    see what kids go for first and you might want to link it with their psychology
    and use shapes they look out for first or colours.

  body: "Treating it as a piece of lettering, rather than a logotype (with all that
    implies), you have the CAS almost (but not quite) running into each other, while
    the TERS don't; I think this needs some work on. As Lex recommends I would look
    at making the crossbar of the T narrower and lighter, the centre bar of the E
    slightly shorter and lighter, the bowl and leg of the R wider and more fluid and
    the middle section of the Ss have a sudden change of stress, the A has a fairly
    geometric shape to its right leg especially, while the C doesn't have the calligraphic
    aspects of the other characters. I think I would make the C larger and work on
    the interaction between the characters.\r\nTim"
