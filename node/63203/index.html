  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on a university assignment which tasks us to design a series of crime fiction book covers (based on Ian Rankin&rsquo;s rebus series). The main objective is to be able to create a unified visual and/or theme which identifies the books as a series and as part of the genre.</p>
<p>My concept is essentially taking photos as though from a first person perspective, reflecting Rebus' harsh, violent view of the world. This does not specifically mean Rebus himself, since the job of a police officer is to see through the eyes of criminals or victims.</p>
<p>I want the type to reinforce this idea. I&rsquo;m trying to figure out a way I can prevent the text from obscuring the image without drawing too much attention away from it or making it unreadable. These are the two best solutions I&rsquo;ve come up with&hellip;</p>
<p>This first option involves trying  to integrate the text in to the scenery (hopefully exectuted more effectively than this):
![](/images/old-images/First Person 1_3507.3 (S2).jpg)</p>
<p>The second option is to overlay the text:</p>
<p>![](/images/old-images/First Person 5-1 (S3)_4160.jpg)</p>
<p>The title for this second one will be laid out similarly to this:
![](/images/old-images/Type Test 2_6549.jpg)</p>
<p>Is there any advice anyone can offer? Are EITHER of these working well?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like the idea of a pov photo as a unifying element.
The idea of an intergrated type could also be quite interesting; maybe actually have the cigarette on the pub photo.
The photos, however, don&rsquo;t quite fit with a pov; with the pub shot the angle is too low whilst the playground shot is too close to the paper - from personal experience the best way of getting a pov is to place the camera slightly behind where the head would be rather than actually in front of you.</p>
<p>You may also like to look at the penquin books as an inspiration on creating a diverse yet unified aesthetic.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here are some nearly final versions. I couldn&rsquo;t seem to get the type to integrate well consistently, and shooting the pictures from a more correct first person POV didn&rsquo;t look quite right either, so I ended up defaulting to the second layout.  The changes I made to the curves makes the pictures give off that sort of amateur vibe much more effectively than they were before, and gives them a sort of retro look (a good thing, since Rebus is always reminiscing to the past).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually quite happy with these.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The way the rectangle intersects the type is a bit awkward to me. I would also move the titling over to the left and better center it ( if you want it to be off-center, it may be a good idea to scale it down some )</p>
<p>I would also advise against using the newspaper shot - insofar as it makes me wonder whether I should read it as part of the titling – but it does give me an idea, especially since you mention integrating the type inside the image. Why not have your author and title be inside the newspaper? ( but you&rsquo;d have to use another photo : ) You can extend this idea to include neon signs ( fairly easy to create in photoshop, and overlay onto a seedy-looking urban photo ) auto decals / license plates / graffiti / whatever. In any case, the best, most flat &amp; graphic, most genre-appropriate images are #2 and #4 above - good job.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t wish to take this route - or don&rsquo;t have time - perhaps you can at least supplant the newspaper with a nicer-looking, non-color newspaper, turned to a page with miniscule type.</p>
<p>Good effort so far.</p>
