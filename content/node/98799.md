  I am now looking for a firm which can develop the spacing and kerning values for
  the font and finalize it.\r\nIs there any firm for this service? I only know IKERN.COM.\r\nBut
  I would like to reach to other firms too.\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    foundry. In the past I have respaced a number of third-party fonts, including
    Goudy's Deepdene for LA's Museum of Contemporary Art. Of course there are others
    here who can also do good work.\r\n\r\nIf you have a budget for results of higher
    quality than iKern can produce please do request a quote: hpapazian at gmail dot
