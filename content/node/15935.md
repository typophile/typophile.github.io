  body: ">essentially a large optical size\r\n\r\nI don't think this is accurate.
    Jonathan Hoefler pointed out in an interview that regular caps are designed primarily
    to go with the lower case, whereas titling caps are designed for an all-caps setting.
    This is the essential difference. For example, Hermann Zapf did two versions of
    Titling Caps for Palatino, one thinner than the roman and one thicker--Michaelangelo
    and Sistina, now with different names in Palatino Nova. In both cases I believe
    that they have a greater variation in width from the regular roman caps. This
    is a tendency in Titling Caps, following the Roman letters on the Trajan column
    in Rome. Also titling caps will generally be spaced looser because of the intended
    all caps setting, I believe."

  body: "Titling caps can be set either looser or tighter depending on the font.  A
    classic roman face would in most cases be set looser.\r\nGenerally, the things
    that change are those that are needed to be typeset well at text sizes. Contrast
    can increase at large sizes and there is less need for trapping.  You can also
    have a true hairline sans because it won't be used small. The width may be a tad
    more condensed as well.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Eric, there is clearly no consensus on what defines titling caps stylistically.
    \r\n\r\nHistorically, in a practical sense, they were simply capitals which used
    the entire type body (i.e., including the descender space). Thus, in a 60 point
    titling font, the caps would be nearly 60 points tall (minus overshoot space and
    other design considerations). Also, the J and Q would be designed not to extend
    below the baseline since there was no metal down there. Etc. \r\n\r\nTitling caps
    in modern fonts are not really the same thing. I know of none that are designed
    to fill the em square in the way that traditional titling caps did."

  body: "A couple of other things: \r\n\r\nYou might wonder why they would have made
    titling caps the way they did in the first place. One reason (probably the main
    reason) was for large inset initial caps on paragraphs. Since there was no extra
    space for descenders below the cap, you got a nice snug fit.\r\n\r\nThe other
    thing to keep in mind (and this relates to Thomas' comment about optical size),
    titling caps were made only in display sizes, not text sizes."

  body: "The design conventions for smallcaps are pretty clear, because of the height
    and weight relationship to the lowercase and regular caps.\r\n\r\nI disagree with
    Thomas that 'titling caps' implies a large optical size of the regular caps, although
    that is certainly one common kind of titling caps. I think there is a lot of stylistic
    leeway in the design of titling caps, and they may be lighter or darker and may
    be significantly different in proportion and detail from the regular caps. Eric
    Gill's Golden Cockerel type -- shown here as drawn for digital type by Dave Farey
    -- is an interesting example of a design in which the treatment of some letters
    varies between the regular and titling caps (note the C and Q):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cockerel.gif]\r\n\r\nWilliam
    made reference to Jonathan Hoefler's comments on the subject, and I think one
    of the most important points Jonathan made is that in titling caps there can and
    perhaps should be more variation in the width of the letters (hence, for example,
    the famously narrow E and F in the Trajan letters).\r\n\r\nAlso note that the
    relative height on the body has varied in some classic titling sets, such as Mardersteig's
    brilliant Dante:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dante.gif]"

  body: "> the relative height on the body has varied\r\n\r\nIn metal, titling caps
    almost always fill the entire EM height. This is for reasons of efficiency as
    well as the lack of negative leading: if you wanted tight multiple lines of all-caps
    the lc descender area would get in the way! In digital, because of the ease of
    sizing and negative leading, and because there can always be an advantage to lining
    up baselines (between a titling font and normal one) I think it's better to avoid
    the old metal standard.\r\n\r\n> the J and Q would be designed not to extend below\r\n>

    though. When Thomas focuses on optical compensation, I think he's about 90% there
    actually - at least in relation to a text cut - the further elaborations can be
    said to explain the differences between titling and display cuts.\r\n\r\nAs for
    the nature of titling caps, I'd just\r\nadd one thing: you need a lot more...

  body: "Let me re-phrase that slightly. The difference in optical compensation is
    the required element of titling capitals compared to a text face. An optional
    element is to have design differences, which may be minor or major.\r\n\r\nIf
    it is a really different design, I think of it as more of a companion titling
    face rather than the titling version of the same face. For example, Michelangelo
    is being renamed and re-released as \"Palatino Titling.\" I can understand the
    marketing reasons for it, and it also clarifies the use of the typeface, which
    are both good things - but from a design perspective I am not sure that I agree
    with the naming, because it's just a little too dissimilar to Palatino.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"
