  is a font that was used for a monogram for a baby announcement that was produced
  by Cranes.  I'm trying to laser cut it in wood and need the font to do so.  Thanks
  for your help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/423134_346665608705803_874370002_n_6266.jpg]"

  body: "AFAIK this is not a retail font.\r\nIt could be a modern hybrid of styles
    produced for Cranes.\r\nThe base letters are in a style developed in the early
    19th century, which is known as \"Tuscan\" and is characterized by the fishtail
    terminals.\r\nThe clean line rationalist structure and minimalist flower ornamentation
    reminds me  of some 18th century initials.\r\nIf you only need the letters _L_,
    _C_ and _I_ your best solution might be to have them scanned to make vector outlines
    for your laser cutter.\r\nNeedless to say, I could be wrong and someone has made
    this into a font. All I can say is that I have not seen anything like it in the
    sources, both printed and online, that I usually check.\r\nDon\r\n"
