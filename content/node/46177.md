  anyone know any more about this font? is there a digital version? or does anyone
  know where I could find a full character set...\r\n\r\nAny info or links would be
  much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n-M\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/signet_5952.jpg]"

    Old Style]] is basically the same typeface. I notice that the M is different from
    the one shown in the Solotype Catalog, but I think the rest of the letters are
    the same.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
