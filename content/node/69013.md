  The British newspaper The Guardian published a special seven-page supplement devoted
  to San Serriffe, a small republic said to consist of several semi-colon-shaped islands
  located in the Indian Ocean. A series of articles affectionately described the geography
  and culture of this obscure nation. Its two main islands were named Upper Caisse
  and Lower Caisse. Its capital was Bodoni, and its leader was General Pica. The Guardian's
  phones rang all day as readers sought more information about the idyllic holiday
  spot. Only a few noticed that everything about the island was named after printer's
  terminology. The success of this hoax is widely credited with launching the enthusiasm
  for April Foolery that gripped the British tabloids in subsequent decades. \r\n\r\nArticle:
