body: Hey all.  Speaking of Unicode, I&#39;m having a little problem getting a particular
  codeset to work.  I can get the Private Use Area codes to work, even tried Armenian
  as an experiment and it works too; but when I assign the codepoints for I Ching
  Hexagram symbols, they won&#39;t show up in the MS Word &#34;Insert &#62; Symbol&#34;
  box.  What am I missing?

  body: Does it matter that the I Ching hexagram symbols were given codepoints in
    Unicode version 4 while the most recent version of FontLab/TypeTool only includes
    information up to Unicode version 3.2? <BR> <BR>If this is the case, should I
    compose a codepage file to reflect the new information &#40;since Unicode 4.0&#41;?
