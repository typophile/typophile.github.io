		<div class="commentbody">Biologically speaking the cells which make up the basic building <BR>blocks of the human body are structurally the same. Yet, in the face <BR>of this, we still develop into recognizable individuals. How it this <BR>so? Because each individual has a distinct DNA code which differs <BR>from all others. The result of all this blending of individualism is a <BR>active structure called society. <BR> <BR>Nomad is an interactive typeface based on this socio-biological <BR>diagram of human society, where basically each character <BR>(biological entity) consists of independent cells each with their <BR>own given code. Once typed, these codes work together to form the <BR>Nomad characters. As these characters grow into words, sentences <BR>and eventually paragraphs they in turn from lager reactive structures <BR>each with their own unique identities. <BR> <BR>Unlike other typefaces in its similarity to biological creatures, <BR>Nomad relies on its complex structure and its ability to react to <BR>touch to create a more fluid relationship between the user and itself. <BR>Based on the aforementioned principles, I have designed two prototype <BR>versions of the Nomad typeface. One, which manifests its independent <BR>of external stimuli through motion, and the second which has an <BR>interactive component that reacts to external stimulus, thus allowing <BR>it to recognize the presence of the user. <BR> <BR>Handwriting allows one to establish the existence of its creator as it <BR>differs from person to person. Nomad act like handwriting in a network <BR>situation expressing the existence of the other user through the state of <BR>its interactivity or motion. As a result of this type of mediation we can <BR>begin to be felt across the network. <BR>(originally Nomad was developed for touch screen) <BR> <BR>Thanks for the advice. It encourage me to do another project.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerhard: <BR> <BR>I agree, this isn't a typeface that anyone should use to set a text block. That's why I was careful to use the word &quot;gestalt&quot; when describing its legibility. (Is &quot;readability&quot; perhaps the preferred term here? All of my dictionaries give almost identical definitions for the two words, i.e., &quot;capable of being read.&quot;) <BR> <BR>In any event, it is fascinating how the cells' overlapping shapes coalesce into recognizable glyphs that can and do, in fact, succeed in communicating information. Not large amounts of information, mind you, but with proper attention paid to spacing, setting and context, this typeface certainly lends itself to display/head information. <BR> <BR>David Thometz</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for making the distinction between legibility and readability. But by doing so you have effectively validated the relevance of both! The RvL quote is really too simple-minded. Saying &quot;legibility does not exist&quot; is like saying &quot;communism does not exist&quot;. No concept can exist in its pure state, sure. But even though the Soviet Union was not -and could not have been- a &quot;pure&quot; communist state, it was certainly more communist than the USA. In the same way, Quadraat is more legible (and certainly more readable) than FF Extra. Pretending otherwise is often an escape from having to take the non-artistic issues in typography/type_design seriously, and this leads to inferior communication. <BR> <BR>Note that intentionally downplaying legibility is something else. It's OK, as long as you have good reason to do it. But legibility *does* exist, and how! <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hah. Good points. I should say that I haven't  <BR>bought RVL's argument outright. But I do think it's  <BR>useful as a way to put legibility in context. <BR> <BR>You can see how, in the case of Nomad (and even in  <BR>the some of the old Ray Gun stuff) how the seeming  <BR>abandonment of legibility is just another design  <BR>'element' or 'treatment' (for lack of a better  <BR>word). That diminished legibility requires readers  <BR>to participate more closely or more actively. When  <BR>this is used properly it can be powerful or  <BR>delightful or engaging. Used improperly you could  <BR>lose your audience and fail to communicate your  <BR>message. <BR> <BR>In essence I agree with you Hrant.
