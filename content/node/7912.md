    Chronicle interests you the most? They have many  different lines as seen below.
    From what I&#39;ve noticed their books are always well designed. Some of my favorite
    little &#40;read: smaller&#41; design books were published by Chronicle. <BR>

    I started to apologize with <BR>the people on this forum &#40;I love this forum&#41;
    ; <BR>since a few weeks ago happened to me something <BR>I considered un-fair,
    I have probably posted some <BR>bad thoughts, or I have been typo-graphically
    un- <BR>ethic. I am sorry. <BR> <BR>Back to my ?/curiosity/concern -- If anybody
    here <BR>is not working for Chronicle, I would appreciate <BR>a comment on the
    typefaces they use, the form of <BR>their books, for the lines &#39;Art &#43;
    Design,&#39; <BR>&#39;Children&#39;s Books&#39; &amp; &#39;Literature&#39; &#40;if
    you have, <BR>if you can, of course&#41;. Maybe you could post a <BR>little scan
    of some interesting/odd/special <BR>parts/details -- tha would be great, and I&#39;m
    sure <BR>other people here could add their point of view. <BR>I don&#39;t feel
    like to write to Chronicle asking <BR>this, I prefer to ask this here. Hope that
    my <BR>&#39;thread&#39; is not too weird. <BR> <BR>Peter Sellers starring &#39;Hoffman&#39;

    <BR> <BR>I know that, and I am looking forward to check <BR>one &#40;or more&#41;
    book myself with my hands ; meanwhile <BR>I appreciate any virtual help &amp;/or
    critical opinion <BR>from this board. <BR> <BR>Sincerely, <BR>Alessandro'

    moved across the country, but I still design books for them.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    sorry not to respond sooner, but I was a little confused: what is it you want

  body: Hello Mr. Benjamin Shaykin ! <BR> <BR>Right today I put my eyes on &#39;Black
    &amp; White&#39; by Steven Guarnaccia <BR>and Susan Hochbaum -- wonderful book
    !  &#40;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/5ybvu" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/5ybvu</a>&#41;
    <BR>Well, recently I have been bitten by sort of &#39;copyleft&#39; virus, <BR>and,
    well, no wonder you were confused because of my question. <BR>It seems to me that
    this house is quite brave &amp; visually smart. <BR>I&#39;d love to work for such
    minds, so I envy you a little bit. <BR>I was wondering who, in general, or specifically,
    is in charge <BR>of choosing &amp; using typefaces in the books about Art &amp;
    Design <BR>and Children&#39;s.  Does this always come from the authorship, or
    <BR>is rather a consult between Chronicle and the book designers ? <BR> <BR>Thank
    you very much, <BR>Alessandro
