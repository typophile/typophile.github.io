  Yves. We met and spent a good amount of time together at TypeCon in NYC but I can't
  seem to find his email address etc. anywhere on the web. I was going to post in
  the Type ID forum because I know he's a moderator there but deemed it inappropriate.
  Thanks in advance! (Yes I did try the email at the bottom of typographer.org but
  the message was bounced back to me.)\r\n\r\n-David Bailey"

    and send him a message through that.

    talked to him since! Forgot to come back and edit this though.
