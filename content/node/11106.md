    <BR> <BR>I agree, the frames are a hassle, but we haven&#39;t had much luck trying
    to strip them out. A new version of the BB software is coming out, and we&#39;re
    hoping that is one of the new features. '

  body: ' Jared: <BR> <BR>Since the subject of passwords has been brought up, I haven&#39;t
    been able to use my account since I first signed up for it many months ago. The
    password that I thought I used when the account was created doesn&#39;t work,
    and the system won&#39;t let me make a new account with the same name or e-mail
    address. I sent an e-mail shortly afterward, but any reply never made it to me.
    <BR> <BR>Can anything be done? I&#39;ve been getting along without trouble by
    manually entering my name and e-mail address on my posts, but it would be nice
    to have access to all of the functionality of an account. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>

  body: ' In both IE 5.1 and Netscape 4.7x on my Mac the discussion pages are almost
    always far, far too wide. I have to scroll right to read long lines of text that
    don&#39;t have any line breaks in them, and the limit on just how wide these pages
    can get seems to be infinite. In this PARTICULAR thread the page works fine -
    as if the frame it is in has a set pixel limit, but many other threads here don&#39;t
    seem to have any page/column width limit. Surely this can be fixed pretty simply
    by tweaking the templates. '

    you raise is true--there are no  <BR>set pixel dimensions. You&#39;ll notice it

  body: ' Manual line-breaking is indeed a form of art. <BR>But note this: it reaches
    true nirvana only <BR>when one adapts the actual content to <BR>create a pleasant
    block of text. <BR> <BR>Furthermore: a good paragraph is neither a <BR>roller-coaster
    ride with huge gaps and juts, <BR>nor is it a military tribunal with completely
    <BR>straight sides; it is a pragmatic, human thing <BR>that is neither frantic
    nor frigid. The Ancient <BR>Greeks knew this; in comparison, the Romans <BR>were
    juvenile. <BR> <BR>My maxim for the ASCII age is this: Write for the rag. <BR>
    <BR>But the reason I refuse to do it on Typophile is simple: the typing window
    uses the predictable, monospaced Courier, but the end-result uses a proportional
    font - this makes the creation of nice text blocks much too laborious. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' By the way, I think I owe Jared an apology. <BR> <BR>On re-reading my previous
    post, it could be construed that I was complaining about a lack of assistance
    with my account and password. In truth, I sent only one e-mail regarding the problem,
    several months ago, and it was a secondary mention within a message about another
    topic. I didn&#39;t bother following up because I was getting along just fine
    on the boards entering my name and e-mail address manually with each post. <BR>
    <BR>It was only with the creation of this thread that I thought to ask about it
    again. As you can see, Jared fixed the problem for me immediately, for which I
    am grateful. <BR> <BR>My previous post was somewhat careless, and while Jared
    made no indication of taking offense, I wanted to clear the air anyway. <BR> <BR>Jared
    and Joe run a great organization, and I for one really appreciate their efforts.
