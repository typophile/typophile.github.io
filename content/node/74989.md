    Black</a>.

  body: "Thanks a ton Renko!!\r\n\r\nI think it's Dispatch Condensed Black with what
    you noted a thick outline. The leg's right serif of the L seems to be inline with
    the stem's right serif. It's that force on the negative space that I'm really
    interested. \r\n\r\nTo bad one can't outline glyphs on Myfonts ;)\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."

  body: "You might look at Aachen Bold or Black.\r\nThere are a few slab serif faces
    that look similar, and because of the way this was laid out it makes it tough
    to give an exact match."

  body: "Thanks for that fontgeek, I see what you mean. But it appears to me that
    the underside of the serifs are rounded where they meet the stem, a bit to 'smooth'
    for the slab I have in mind.\r\n\r\nI gave Font Bureau a call asking to try out
    Dispatch. Pretty much sure I'm going with that family.  "
