  body: I also think it looks a lot like <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/knockout/testdriver/ko48.html"
    target="_blank">HTF Knockout No. 48</a> &#40;or near that&#41; that has been &#39;softened&#39;
    to round off and blur the terminals.

  body: This is Elderkin by Eric Olson / Process Type Foundry. For some reason it&#39;s
    not available on his site any longer. I purchased it before it was removed. Another
    alternative would be Ultramagnetic <a href="http://youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0020"
    target="_blank">http://youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0020</a> or Garage
    Gothic from Font Bureau <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GarageGothic"
    target="_blank">http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GarageGothic</a>. Mike&#39;s idea
    is also a good one, if you just need to set a headline or short bit of text you
    could try Trade Gothic Condensed Bold and round the corners in Illustrator or
    Freehand for a similar feel.

  body: Eric Olson gave an explanation why he removed both  <BR>Process Grotesque
    and Elderkin in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4102/6314.html?1107978640"
    target="_blank"> this thread</a>. Process  <BR>Grotesque is being reworked, but
    I fear Elderkin&#39;s gone  <BR>the way of the <a href="http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/expeditions/treasure_fossil/Treasures/Dodo/dodo.html?dinos"
    target="_blank"> dodo</a>.
