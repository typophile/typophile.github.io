  certain font.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.shunn.net/mormon/terror/img/nametag.gif"
  target="_blank">http://www.shunn.net/mormon/terror/img/nametag.gif</a> <BR> <BR>The
  first line, not the serifed font below. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve looked it up on a font
  identifier, which told me Avenir and Arial Curved Bold, neither of which can actually
  work for this font, as their O&#39;s are round and larger than the average letter.
  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s monospaced, but I could be wrong. Here&#39;s another
  sample: <BR> <BR><a href="http://mikeli.image.pbase.com/u6/jhales/small/981811.John11701003.jpg"

  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance.'

    DIN</a> has a better range of weights that gets closer to the look.

  body: It&#39;s not really a font, it&#39;s engraved lettering. I wouldn&#39;t be
    surprised if it were something like <a href="http://www.scottmachine.com/scott.htm">standard
    style</a> of a Scott Master Engraving Font. That said, I would be shocked if there
    weren&#39;t DTP fonts &#40;probably free&#41; around.
