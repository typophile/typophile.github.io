    first is an essay by designers who believe that designers could be doing better
    things with their talents and abilities than marketing products\u2014products
    which are, in the view of the authors, unnecessary. There might be a connection
    to Adbusters by way of inspiration.\r\n\r\nAdbusters is an attempt at mocking
    branding and marketing, in which advertisements and the mainstream media are parodied
    with recreations of their advertisements and ephemera, usually by altering the
    wording of an ad campaign. The people behind it refer to their activity as culture
    jamming, although as I already pointed out in another thread, most people pay
    no attention, so it\u2019s not so much affecting culture as a dialogue between
    holier-than-thou hipsters. It has been pointed out that Adbusters itself is a
    heavily branded, overpriced magazine just like those it often mocks, and that
    the same can be said for the unbranded products sometimes sold within its pages
    or by its creators. \r\n\r\nYour best bet for understanding the anti-consumerist
    movement is to go down to the library and start sifting through old issues of
    Adbusters, or find a local group that engages in this stuff and talk to them.
    Reading up on Jonathan Barnbrook would be very worthwhile."

  body: "> Adbusters itself is a heavily branded, overpriced magazine\r\n\r\nThe magazine
    is only overpriced if you compare it to those that carry advertising, which generally
    provides many times the income that circulation does. Since Adbusters carries
    no ads, the cover price is naturally going to be at least double what an ad-rich
    publication will (and remember that an 80 page issue without ads has the same
    editorial space as a 200 pages magazine that carries ads.\r\n\r\n(And no, I am
    not a holier-than-thou hipster. I have bought exactly 1 copy of the magazine in
    the last five years.)"

    is a need for someone to stand up and complain so that someone else will stand
    up and fix it for those poor shmoes, EDITORIAL WILL BE THERE!\r\n\r\nBut going
    back to Adbusters, they do have some hard hitting journalism being conducted.
    Just recently they had a [[http://www.adbusters.org/the_magazine/73/The_Death_of_Canadian_Journalism.html|scathing
    expos\xE9 about the mass media in Vancouver, BC]]. Damn scary, if you ask me.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    their recent coverage of [[http://www.adbusters.org/the_magazine/73/So_Paulo_A_City_Without_Ads.html|S\xE3o
    Paulo]]'s decision to remove all of their outdoor advertising is a very soothing
    concept that I wish most cities in America would adopt."

    before the invention of the printing press and will live on long after it becomes

    ridiculous. When was the last time you blacked out after watching tv commercials
    and woke up with 50 boxes of Tide detergent? Advertising helps us decide. Nothing

    It's not until about half-way through the magazine when it gets to the actual

    you gotta love a product that says, \"Buying stuff and marketing stuff is bad!\"

    manifest themselves into rather obnoxious and ill-conceived actions that puts

    an increasingly polarized world where those that partake in the issues tend to
    trend to one extreme or the other. \r\n\r\nI'd like to seem something happening

    we buy that no one has had the time to put effort into that realm. ;o)\r\n\r\nI
    can say the more I watch Nickelodeon with my Kids, the more I realize that there

    us at a very young age. (And yea, I should just shut the TV off, but Spongebob

  body: "I started a green marketing company in 1988, and tried to make a go of it
    for a couple of years.\r\nI worked out a philosophy and practice that addressed
    the issue of creativity.\r\nAs every ad should be, in essence, an environmental
    audit--reasoning why the product is justified or an improvement--there is no place
    for stretched benefits, i.e. claims and promises which have nothing to do with
    the product's environmental impact.\r\nFor instance, a celebrity endorsement or
    a suggestion that a car will give the consumer sex appeal or social status.\r\nThat
    challenged a lot of the notions of creativity which exist in advertising, making
    it quite restricted.\r\nAs well as \"non-creative\" ads, it was also hard to get
    clients to buy into the idea that, for instance, smaller ads were better. Creatives,
    of course, like big ads with white space.\r\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that
    the traditional business qualities advertisers look for in an agency are the be-all
    and end-all: price, quality (includes creativity), and service, and called it
    a day in 1990, by which time the green buzz of the late '80s was fading and digitization
    was capturing everyone's imagination. No doubt I could have kept at it longer
    if I'd been a better salesman.\r\n \r\nThere are a small number of green and pro
    bono agencies, and they will remain a small number. Some environmentally-favorable
    practices occur in the industry, notably to do with materials used, but that doesn't
    address the central issue of consumption-stimulation, and the role played by \"creativity\"
    in hyping it.\r\n\r\nThere is only so much that business can do, because its bottom
    line is the bottom line.\r\nIt's up to governments to regulate consumption--in
    the aggregate, citizens and corporations have too much self-interest to make much
    of a difference individually, despite the best efforts of a green minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
