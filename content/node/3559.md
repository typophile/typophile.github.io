  was going for something more modern but still had a somewhat constructivist feel.  I
  also kept in mind a possible application in screen printing. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/285.gif"

  body: ' I&#39;m a big fan of constructism myself - And overall, the face feels right.
    It definately works better in large sizes. The counterspaces get lost in the small
    sizes.  <BR> <BR>The balance of some letters seem off. Letters like &#34;A&#34;
    seem perfectly symmetrical when others like &#34;W&#34; or &#34;P&#34; feel like
    the right stroke is heavier than the left. <BR> <BR>Could you elaborate on your
    statement of  &#34;going for something more modern?&#34; I&#39;m curious as to
    what you meant by that. '
