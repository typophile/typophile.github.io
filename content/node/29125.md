body: I'm sure this has been covered somewhere before, but is it possible to include
  "flat" and class-based kerning in the same OT font file? Are there any ill effects
  of doing this? Any help is appreicated. Thnx.

  body: "GPOS based kerning can handle pairs and classes equally well. Kerning in
    the 'kern' table can only do pairs (ignoring Apple's extensions for AAT for the
    moment).\r\n\r\nMost Adobe fonts have both pairs and class-based kerning in the
    GPOS table 'kern' feature. This works just fine.\r\n\r\nIf you are asking about
    having both GPOS kern feature and 'kern' table in the same font, that's another
    question. The results of doing so are undefined in the spec, and there's no guarantee
    what will happen. But a number of folks have done it, without obvious disasters
    occurring.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: i guess i should clarify my question a bit. is there any reason why one should
    duplicate what's handled by class-based kerning with pairs in the GPOS kern feature?
    maybe i'm overthinking this...

  body: If I understood your question, the answer is "No". To include kerning data
    in OpenType CFF fonts all you need to do is to provide a 'kern' feature with all
    the positioning rules (and necessary classes, obviously). That's how it's done
    in Adobe's fonts.

  body: thnx for your answer, Miguel. I was wondering, is it possible to get notes
    for your <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/atypi2006/atypi_Adventures_in_class_kerning.pdf">Adventures
    in Class Kerning</a>? I can follow the PDF untill i get to the code optimization
    portion, and then i get lost.

  body: "I don't have any notes, unfortunately. I demoed a macro with a few fonts,
    and that's where the code comes from. Yes, the slides are not very useful by themselves.
    Is there something specific you'd like to know?\r\n\r\nEssentially, I demonstrated
    that in big fonts (2500+ glyphs, 3 scripts, 15000+ kerning pairs, for example)
    it is necessary to optimize the code of the 'kern' feature. FontLab 5.x does a
    great job, but unfortunately it's not enough. And in some situations, the order
    in which the kerning classes are arranged in the Classes panel (yes, the Classes
    panel), might mean the difference between one 'kern' feature that compiles, and
    one that doesn't.*\r\n\r\n* this has to do with the fact that when FontLab generates
    the 'kern' feature, the class-class kern commands are ordered in the same way
    as the kerning classes appear on the Classes panel. And this order might not be
    the ideal if subtable breaks are also added.\r\nIn a font containing kerning classes
    for Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and punctuation, for example, one of the ways to avoid
    overflow errors upon trying to compile a 'kern' feature, is by arranging the same
    kind of classes next to each other (i.e. all Latin classes, then all Greek classes,
    and so on).\r\n\r\nAlso, in a big font project, FontLab generates a 'kern' feature
    with too many subtable breaks. In my example, FL was adding about 11 subtable
    breaks, when only 3 were effectively necessary, as I showed."

    Sergey Malkin (who maintains Microsoft VOLT) and Yuri Yarmola (our chief Fontlab

    of FontLab Studio:\r\n-- Allow the creation of class supersets/class groups (classes
    that contain classes or classes+glyphs)\r\n-- In \"Class kerning with exceptions\"
    mode, allow exceptions of key-glyph/key-glyph pairs, or abandon the concept of
    key-glyph (this might sound strange at first, but class kerning is about kerning
    classes and glyphs; the key-glyph is in a grey area, because it can act as glyph
    or as a class)\r\n-- Compile kerning data on the fly, and report kerning problems
    (class overlapping, inaccessible kern pairs downstream, etc.)\r\n\r\nThis will
    keep you guys busy for a while... :^)"

    it seems this would require to think of kerning and the interface differently.

    files.)"

    think that the kerning problem should be solved in a completely different manner.
    The final classes embedded in the font do not, conceptually, have anything in
    common with the classes used in the design process. The classes in an OpenType
    font are a mechanism for technical compression. The classes used in the design
    are for the designer. I hope that we can find a solution that will separate those
    two entirely: the designer will be free to set up classes in the FontLab Studio
    interface in any possible way (such as, mix Cyrillic A with Latin A in one class),
    but in the process of the actual kerning compilation, the kerning will be composed
    in a different, optimal way, including both pairpos pairs and class pairs depending
    on the outcome of an automatic optimization algorithm. \r\n\r\nUnlike a handful
    of experts at Adobe, regular type designers do not have to, and should not be
    bothered with things like subtable breaks, class overlapping etc. \r\n\r\nWe will
    keep the UI access and the programmatic access to the OpenType Layout feature
    definition source code (in AFDKO syntax). This means that people are free to develop
    their own Python code to transform the \"visual\" kerning information (Classes
    panel and Metrics window) into the AFDKO code -- just the way you did it Miguel.
    \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Stumbling across this old thread again ...\r\nI did some quick experiments
    in this respect recently. To my surprise I found that though \"tidying up\" classes
    helps AFDKO a bit when generating a kern feature (replacing left class and right
    class that have same glyph coverage by a single class will create a more economic
    GPOS), it does <em>not</em> necessarily help to completely rearrange kerning and
    classes. So providing AFDKO with a kern feature as VOLT's kern2volt would create
    it rather troubles AFDKO. This maybe because AFDKO and VOLT generate GPOS differently,
    and AFDKO works better with a kern feature more or less following the designer's
    logic of setting up classes."

    am just now learning about the Glyph Positioning table (GPOS based kerning). All
    I know about it is that it's a table that microsoft will read to interpret the
    kerning values for my opentype-flavored opentype font. I know that in fontlab
    I can export it if I have the box checked next to \"Generate \"kern\" feature

    \"export opentype tables\", but where can I edit the GPOS kerning feature/table?\r\n\r\nMr.
    Sousa - What is code optimization (for kerning)? How do you do it? Do you use
    the opentype panel and change the code in it? If so, why do that instead of use
    the metrics window, as I have been doing for all of my kerning adjustments? All
    you need to do is to click the button \"Apply and Save\" in Kerning Assistance
    to make adjustments made in the metrics window show up in the opentype panel,
    -- even if you have defined no classes at all, this will generate a \"kern\" feature,
    I believe. Or am I wrong about this? I'm getting confused about some of these
    things!\r\n\r\nBTW I am working on OTF-flavored OpenType fonts."
