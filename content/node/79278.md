  many open source fonts which are under GPL for allowing me to modify and project
  the fonts for Ubuntu themes. \r\n\r\nEULA, CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 and CC BY-ND 3.0 s-u-c-k!\r\n\r\nI
  need the open source and free fonts for projecting the Gnome and GTK themes for
  Ubuntu. \r\n\r\nDo you know some good sites of many and many open source and GPL-like
  fonts?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nKevin"

  body: "See: http://www.openfontlibrary.org/wiki/Existing_Free_Fonts\r\n\r\nAnd go
    to the final page and see \"Freeware Fonts\"\r\n\r\nNo, no, no.\r\n\r\nAll these
    typodesigners, as Ray Larabie, Klein, and other don't allow to distribute, re-distribute
    and to derivate or remix their works, according their EULA. They don't want and
    won't hear the OpenFontLibrary's persuasion. These fonts are closed source while
    Linux is an open source software. \r\n\r\nI found the Ray Larabie and other proprietary
    typodesigners freeware fonts housed on Ubuntu software center. Then why did Ubuntu
    house the Ray Larabie and other proprietary typodesigners <strong>closed source</strong>
    freeware fonts on its software center?\r\n\r\nI'm against the house of Ray Larabie
    and other proprietary typodesigners fonts on Ubuntu because they're closed source!
    The closed source fonts, although are freeware, mustn't be housed on Ubuntu or
    any distros of Linux!\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause the users of Linux know what
    open source is and Linux is open source, if they know, they'll think all which
    are on Ubuntu are open source, then they'll modify and [re-]distribute the Ray
    Larabie and other proprietary typodesigners fonts without realizing that the derived
    works and [re-]distribution aren't allowed by Ray Larabie and  other proprietary
    typodesigners!\r\n\r\nI know you would tell us that there's description in fonts,
    but not all will view the fonts, not all know English, know reading in English
    and what EULA is!\r\n\r\nI know you would say they can take the free-ware fonts
    on Ubuntu but they can't derive your works for projects and themes of Ubuntu or
    other. But if they want to modify? The closed source fonts mustn't be housed on
    any distros of Linux, only the open source fonts must be housed on Ubuntu or other
    distros of Linux because the users want to modify. \r\n\r\nThen I'm against the
    house of closed source free-fonts on Ubuntu!\r\n\r\nI'm fundamentalist and fanatic
    Linuxer. "

    Font Library]]. [[http://www.dafont.com/|Dafont]] has both for-free and freely-available
    fonts, and usually marks which is what. Similar with [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/|Font

    just sites of freeware fonts. Open source and freeware are different things. Open
    source is GPL-like e CC BY-SA-like, or I mean open source allows to modify, distribute
    and redistribute. GPL and CC BY-SA are different of EULA which doesn't allow to
    modify the fonts. \r\n\r\nMany fonts of Dafont and Fontsquirrel are under EULA
    and not under GPL or CC-BY-SA. "
