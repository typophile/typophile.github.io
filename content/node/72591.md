  2007), Alan Bartram shows a sample of metal Monotype Falstaff (1935) with matching
  italic. How come the digital version of Falstaff currently offered for sale by Monotype
  (and Adobe, etc.) has only a roman version ?"

    for whatever reason. But still I just can\u2019t understand why there are so many
    classic Monotype typefaces which remain unreleased in digital form \u2014 Joseph
    Blumenthal\u2019s Emerson, for instance."
