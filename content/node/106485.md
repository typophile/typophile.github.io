body: "Hi,\r\nThere is tables that explains which applications support different opentype
  features like this link:\r\nhttps://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support\r\nIn
  this table we see that all of the mentioned apps support the \"standard ligatures\"
  opentype feature.\r\nbut how would I know if I implement an GSUB LookupType 5 or
  6 (Contextual substitution) in a standard ligatures it will be executed in those
  apps. I need a GSUB LookupType 5 or 6 to be executed by default so I think it's
  safe to put it in this feature and it will be executed in all of those apps, right?\r\n\r\nThanks"
