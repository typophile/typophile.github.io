  off.\r\n\r\nI was accepted to attend Project M this year.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know
  what it is you can read more about it here:\r\nhttp://www.c2llc.com/projectm.html\r\n\r\nIt's
  an amazing experimental design collective for young creatives that does projects
  for the social good.\r\n\r\nI was accepted today from people all across the country
  to be apart of this years 7 person team.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is everyone has
  to put in $2000 to help pay for the project. It's totally non profit.\r\n\r\nThere
  is no way I can afford to do this without your help. So I'm asking for donations.
  In appreciation everyone who donates will recieve a 4 color limited edition screen
  printed poster designed by me after my Project M experience.\r\n\r\nPlease please
  please help me out!\r\n\r\nTo donate and get more info please go here:\r\nhttp://www.forcedconnections.com/projectm/\r\n\r\nI
  am about to graduate college with a graphic design degree from the University of
  North Texas you can check out more of my work here:\r\nhttp://www.forcedconnections.com/\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\n-Ben Barry"
