  This workbook will be around 30 pages, contain line art illustrations, be printed
  in black and white, and will be designed for her kids, which are young adults with
  mild learning disabilities. She has chosen the typeface FF Meta for the copy of
  the workbook and is unsure about what typeface to use for the titles of each chapter
  section (headlines).\r\n\r\nShe is really set on using FF Meta, and we are trying
  to decide what would be a suitable typeface, if any, serif or sans-serif, that compliments
  Meta well while retaining organization and legibility."

    use Meta Bold Small Caps or All Caps as headers. '

  body: I second Yehan. Either FF Meta Bold SCs/Caps or <a href="http://metaserif.com/">FF
    Meta Serif</a>.

  body: I doubt you'd need to blow a wide hole in your pocket and get Collis. It's
    a beautiful face..but completely unneccesary for your purposes.
