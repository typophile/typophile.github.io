		<div class="commentbody">My studio, Treacyfaces, is continually busy. So, I don't get the luxury of hanging out here as much as I would like. I've just noticed the above post. <BR> <BR>In the current iteration of our treacyfaces.com (up now for about a year), one can get pretty much anywhere - especially to all crucial services - in one click.  <BR> <BR>I believe that's called ideal convenience. <BR> <BR>Indeed, we sell a lot of fonts via the site, and complaints probably amount to 1 in 5000 unique accesses. (You can't be all things to all people.)  <BR> <BR>Yet, we're bookmarked constantly. We're returned to constantly. We're purchased from constantly.  <BR> <BR>This year, our 19th in the type business, has already become our biggest sales year yet. <BR> <BR>We have always designed treacyfaces.com to be accessible to the greatest number of people possible. <BR> <BR>Unlike some sites, we choose not to shut out or frustrate some users by forcing browser or plug-in upgrades right at the entry. I want a happy prospect coming through the door, not one or one who feels frustrated or shunned. <BR> <BR>About the TFArrow inquiry above and what came of it: <BR> <BR>The inquirer asked good questions by e-mail.  <BR> <BR>As is typical for us, they were promptly provided well delineated buying information plus supplemental customized specimens to base a knowledgeable license purchase on.  <BR> <BR>With personal service, we also ensured that the font/weight combination was an exact match. <BR> <BR>The inquirer's company promptly purchased the license they needed. <BR> <BR>Looking back at the transaction details, I believe that the customer received our typically excellent brand of customer service, receiving their license materials promptly.  <BR> <BR>There have been no customer complaints from that buyer, nor from any of our world wide customers who purchased via treacyfaces.com last week. <BR> <BR>For instance, here's one from Australasia who ordered a 4-weight volume this week using treacyfaces.com's quick, one-page online order form:  <BR> <BR>&quot;Thank you for your great service. Very quick and easy with the personal touch! I will not hesitate to use your service again.&quot; <BR> <BR>This is actually the kind of enthusiasm we are greeted with continually. Of course, I thank our customers for it. <BR> <BR></div>

After not talking with him for probably a decade or more (for no particular reason), I was very happy to hear that he's well and still tirelessly devoted to keeping the Lanston collection vibrant as ever.  <BR> <BR>A tip of the Aring to him for his long term devotion to quality!

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, again - <BR> <BR>Thanks very much.  <BR> <BR>I'm currently still reeling from all the interesting info and photos on Mr Giampa's site. (I just returned from the virtual PEI tour. Wish I had packed the virtual DEET. Virtual OUCH! Those mosquitoes!) <BR> <BR>The Optical Size discussion you note is surely interesting, yet I think that Mr Hudson has said everything that needs saying, in a way. I agree with his overall perspective on it, as written. <BR> <BR>An aside: I mourn the passing of Multiple Masters from a technological point of view, but I've always imagined that it created endless gymnastics for the designers who worked to shoehorn their designs into it. Along the lines of all the 'regularization' technique discussions that used to take place in the late '80s and early '90s, for defining seemingly ideal PostScript fonts. <BR> <BR>Take care. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR></div>
