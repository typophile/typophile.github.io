body: I am having exporting a few amount of characters from the family I am creating.   <BR>
  <BR>I wanted all the characters to be accessible in the same &#34;style&#34;. So
  i put an alternative lowercase under the &#34;option &#43; letter&#34; and when
  I try to use it in Illustrator it does not recognize these alternate letters.  I
  recognizes more than half of them, but letter like b,d,j etc. show the default font&#39;s
  original character when i do the abover keystroke&#40; option &#43; z = ?, not my
  character&#41;. <BR> <BR>I am using Mac Roman encoding standard in Fontlab and working
  on a Mac.  Any ideas or should i make it it&#39;s own style? <BR> <BR>jp

  body: Well as any good student if you don&#39;t get 14 hours a day in and answer
    your own post what good are you.  I couldn&#39;t get option &#43; o &#40;oslash&#41;
    to work, but I got its big brother shift &#43; opt &#43; O to work instead.   <BR>
    <BR>Any reason though the other does not work? <BR> <BR>Night! <BR> <BR>jp
