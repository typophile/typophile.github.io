  font appeared once in the french Vogue.\r\nThere are some similar fonts, but i can\u2019t
  find\r\none with the same stroke difference and the\r\nfine details like the angular
  end of \xBBV\xAB or \xBBA\xAB.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nt."

    for your response.\r\nAnd yes, there are similar forms and proportions\r\nto the
    Caslon 540. Is there fallen a name which\r\ncompany made a custom version from
    it?\r\n\r\nthanks, t.\r\n\r\n"
