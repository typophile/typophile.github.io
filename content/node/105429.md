  to find out if there are any other fonts our there with similar forms to this lovely
  new face by Ludovic Balland... I am particularly interested in the sharply delineated
  junctions (brackets?) between stem and the serif, for example in the 'I'...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/StanleyIt_6617.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  as ever for any useful tips!\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt"
