  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

As well as working in education as a designer, I'm an MA Design Studies student at Central St Martins and am conducting research into typography. I'm posting today to see if anyone here might be able to help out with my MA research.

The title of my project is "Life according to type" and is an exploration into how designers can use art as a vehicle for typography to interpret the world around them.

To explain a little more, the project first took form as a way of gaining insight into how legibility and accessibility were affecting typography, how say increased restrictions from certain groups force the designers hand in typographical choices (sight disorders, learning disabilities, etc.) and moved into how to keep the variation in typography alive.

The research aims to look into using typography as a means for expressing the surrounding world, collaboration amongst the design community and for myself curating design/art exhibitions online and in galleries.

I'm hoping to find designers to take part in my research, ideally people who possibly may be able/willing to create a piece of tyopgraphical art which would then be used as as a demonstration/example of my research aims.

I'm also conducting research into how guideline restrictions from groups forces design choices when it comes to typography, as well as personal views of designers on this subject.

If you know of anyone else that may be able/want to help then please do either let me know or pass my details on.

For more information or expressions of interest I can be contacted at either contact@christophernallen.com or cnallen@hotmail.co.uk as well as via Typophile.

Again, thank you for your time in reading this and I look forward to hopefully hearing from some of you soon.

Chris Allen.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I had considered lettering, but decided to concentrate on digital type. Whether the designer creating the piece then translates that type into a physical (drawn, sculpted, etc.) form is entirely up to them as long as they reference the original digital typeface as it is more about keeping the variation in typography alive and I feel that this affects digital more so. I welcome your thoughts on the subject however.

Thanks
