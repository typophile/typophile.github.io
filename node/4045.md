body: Does anybody know how I can add more points to curves, the opposite of  Fontlab&#39;s
  &#34;Transform/Optimize&#34; function. <BR> <BR>I require more points as the font
  is loaded into an interactive environment so more points mean more manipulations
  for the user. <BR> <BR>If anyone knows any ways or software that can do this, please
  let me know. <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>Nic

  body: Also in illustrator. <BR> <BR>Filter &#62; Distort &#62; Roughen <BR>Set the
    distort distance to 0 and add as many points <BR>per inch as  you like. Probably
    the same as the above. <BR> <BR>R

  body: or you can always go in and add more points where you want them directly in
    fontlab - skip illustrator all together. i don&#39;t know of any feature that
    will automatically do this tho.
