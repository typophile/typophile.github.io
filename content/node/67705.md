  body: "I got this question as an e-mail and said I wasn't sure if it was a font.
    I looked through Part 1 of my Guide and think it may be a modification of Jukebox's
    [[http://search.veer.com/Annabelle?producttype=TYP&category=Type|Annabelle]].
    At least the A seems right and the B is similar. Perhaps the B was redrawn to
    be simpler?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Interesting, I had the same feeling - the A looked familiar while the B looked
    kinda DIY :-) ... more like a \"German double s\" \"\xDF\". Maybe it's as simple
    as that. Unfortunately the test drive at veer.com only renders basic Latin chars.\r\nAndreas"

  body: Time for me to weigh in here... The "A" is indeed from Annabelle. The "B"
    is the capital B from my 'Jeffriana' font. Both letters are unaltered and appear
    here as they do in the fonts. Glad I could clear this up. :)
