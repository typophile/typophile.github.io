body: My book publisher wants the titles of my book to be in Republik Sans 2 and 3.
  The text is in Warnock Pro. I think the titles look terrible with the text but can't
  really articulate why. They just feel wrong together. Can anyone suggest language
  to express why this isn't a good pairing? Or do you disagree with me?

  body: What kind of book is it? Republik is quirky and draws attention to itself.
    Could we see a sample of Republik along with Warnock?
