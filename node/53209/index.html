  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an illustrator (the kind with paints, paper and brushes rather than a computer) and I&rsquo;m completely new to the world of font making.  However, I would like to be able to make my own font and then use that font to write on top of a background image that I have painted and scanned in.</p>
<p>Basically, I guess that means creating a font then being able to type it onto a high resolution image.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for advice as to what software I can buy to accomplish this.  (I already have Adobe photoshop.)   All advice would be really appreciated - I&rsquo;ve run searches online but there&rsquo;s so much on offer and I don&rsquo;t know where to start!</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">As an illustrator, why not hand letter?
The lettering can be done as part of the illustration (the usual method).
Or you can paint, draw, write the text as a separate illustration and add to the other illustration as another layer.
Or if type is what you want then check out the software available from Fontlab.
Perhaps a sample of what you trying to achieve might help generate more accurate advice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks - I&rsquo;ve looked at Fontlab and it does seem good.</p>
<p>The reason I don&rsquo;t want to write by hand is that I need display nearly two hundred different children&rsquo;s poems onto full colour illustrated background.  Doing them all by hand would simply be too much work.  (I have a template for the background, which was painted then scanned - I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t include a copy for copyright reasons.)</p>
<p>I should be able to create an original font without too much difficulty - but what I&rsquo;m concerned about how I can then type that font onto my background image.  For example, if I make a font using the Fontlab sofware, would I be able to export that font into something like photoshop or not?</p>
<p>Thanks again.  Sorry if my questions sem basic - but it&rsquo;s all new to me.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">You can use just about anything and any font in photoshop. Once you add your font into your computer&rsquo;s font folder it will be available in photoshop. Using the type tool, (its the tool that looks like a &lsquo;T&rsquo;) click anywhere on your painting and type away. Once typed you can then freely change size, colour and everything else plus move the type around to where ever you want. Photoshop places type on a new layer every time you type. Simple &amp; easy, try it and see. Open any image in photoshop, select the type tool and start typing. The type will appear on a transparent layer and wont affect the image.</div>

I didn&rsquo;t realise my font would be available in photoshop so easily - I thought I&rsquo;d have to do something really complicated to be able to use it there!  Your help has been much appreciated and I hope you have a really great day. :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I use Fontlab, but in this situation I would advise software from High-logic [[http://www.high-logic.com/scanahand.html]] 
The software is less complex and less expensive than FontLab. You will only need a (Virtual) PC, scanner and $49,-</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Fontlab is one option. If you plan on doing most of the drawing by hand you might be better off with Scanfont and Typetool or even Illustrator and Typetool. But font design is not as simple as you think; the learning curve for spacing and kerning is particularly brutal.</p>
<p>I don’t know what your time budget is like, but if you need this done fast you’ll probably be better off to just work your design out on paper and pass it on to a type designer for digitization, spacing, and kerning. If this is a simple font without the need for numbers, punctuation, and accents I could probably digitize it for less than it would cost you to buy Fontlab.</p>
