body: I made a font for a client who uses Corel Draw. Now when I suggested that he
  should switch to Illustrator, that opened a can of worms. He really didn&#39;t like
  my suggestion. <BR> <BR>The font works for him in Word and Works, so it&#39;s obviously
  valid. It works on both my PC and Mac at home. Is there something perhaps in the
  way I&#39;m generating the font? I used Fontlab 4.6 to make it. <BR> <BR>The worse
  part of this is that Chank made the last font for him and it worked perfectly. I
  asked Chank if he did anything different from me &#40;after all, he&#39;s the one
  that taught me&#41; and there wasn&#39;t anything we could come up with.  <BR> <BR>What
  do you think? Anyone have an idea, besides dumping Corel Draw? I mean really, why
  use that program? But that can&#39;t be part of my answer. <BR> <BR>The only possible
  thing I can think of is that I copy and paste the font into a new document. Maybe
  the document is corrupt? I have no clule. Please help me! <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: 'sorry, should have gone into more detail. the font shows up in the type menu.
    however, when he tries to type nothing happens. from what i understand, the cursor
    doesn&#39;t move. so basically corel doesn&#39;t understand the font.  <BR> <BR>i
    came up with two approaches for this after i posted this: <BR>1. download the
    corel 12 trial version and install it on my pc. if it works on there then no problem
    on my end. <BR>2. since i used fontlab, maybe i should use fontographer and export
    it as a ttf file. maybe that might have something to do with it? i don&#39;t like
    that option because fontlab shouldn&#39;t have a problem. <BR> <BR>one thing i
    don&#39;t know is what he&#39;s running. how old his computer is, if he&#39;s
    using windows 98, etc. so there are some unknown variables in this problem.'

  body: That&#39;s strange. <BR>I&#39;d guess that the problem is in your client&#39;s
    machine. Maybe the font isn&#39;t correctly installed. <BR>Have he tried reinstalling
    the font? <BR> <BR>Another &#40;less probable&#41; hypothesis is, there&#39;s
    something wrong with the font&#39;s name. <BR>Any &#39;weird&#39; &#40;non-alphabetical&#41;
    characters in its name?

  body: ' Just because the font works in Word and Works doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s
    nothing wrong with it. Apps that do more complicated stuff with fonts often access
    additional stuff in the font in the way that more basic applications do not. <BR>

  body: Hmm. I see. Thanks, Thomas. <BR>In that case, Tim, I think you should try
    MS Font Validator.
