  body: Top one kinda looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/futura/ef-bold/testdrive.html?s=PROSPEKTA&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank"> Futura Bold</a>, but the bowl on &#34;P&#34;  <BR>and &#34;R&#34;
    seem too big. I don&#39;t know if it really is tho.

  body: I can&#39;t believe I can&#39;t find it, it looks so familiar. But it doesn&#39;t
    appear to be a <a href="http://www.blambot.com">Blambot</a> or Pizzadude creation,
    and I can&#39;t find it anywhere on DaFont or MyFonts. But Blambot should have
    ample alternatives if you can&#39;t find this.
