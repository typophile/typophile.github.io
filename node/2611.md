  body: I&#39;ve noticed in the IndieFonts 2 catalogue that quite a  <BR>few fonts
    from the Galapagos Collection are &#34;inspired&#34;  <BR>by other typefaces.
    There are for example obvious  <BR>similarities between New Age and FF Scala,
    especially in  <BR>the italics; Extreme Sans sits extremely close to Platelet;  <BR>Prop
    Ten could&#39;ve been designed by Frutiger etc.

  body: Yves, Galapagos makes alot of fonts for private clients, and I suppose they
    define the direction of the design. I wouldn&#39;t get down on them. Now if they
    copy one of Marks fonts the gloves come off.

    IndieFonts catalogues.
