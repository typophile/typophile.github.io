  installation co-created by Callum Innes and Colm T\xF3ib\xEDn.\r\n\r\nThese are
  the best images I've been able to find of the type (these have perspective distortion
  and all):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/another_way_5451.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3d891fdf_5901.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  this: \xABthe world in front of her had been washed down\xBB\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/wefindwildness2/5834050522/\r\n\r\nIt
  feels familiar... but I can't quite put my finger on it. Anyone?"
