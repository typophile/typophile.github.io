  body: Wasn't able to identify it but as it has been designed by Christian Broutin
    in 1959 ("who was born in 1933 and only 26 when he designed it") and so pre-dates
    the digital era, I'm afraid it was completely hand-done. Main titles on the 2
    different versions of this poster ([[http://s3.amazonaws.com/auteurs_production/post_images/10899/Jules_et_Jim_MPOTW.jpg|main]]
    and [[http://s3.amazonaws.com/auteurs_production/post_images/10900/Jules_et_Jim_petite_MPOTW.jpg|smaller]])
    do not even look identical to me. They look similar to some [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica|Helvetica]]
    Compressed/[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/folio|Folio]] Condensed Bold a bit
    distorted (by hand?). [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers|Univers]]
    Ultra Condensed, artificially emboldened though, could also work, possibly a bit
    closer for /et (oblique cut /t top).
