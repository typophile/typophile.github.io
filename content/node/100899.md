  body: "Looks hand painted to me, with some letters squeezed in to fit (such as the
    M in 'HANDMADE', everything BUT the M in 'HOMEGROWN', and that silly central peak

    grunge treatment has been post applied or not. Anyway, here are some fonts in
    the same vein: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/shelton/|Shelton]] (very
    close for \"SMOKE\" mixing upper and lowercases), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aerotype/thunderhouse/|Thunderhouse]],
