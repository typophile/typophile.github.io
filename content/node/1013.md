  body: Simon and Andreas, I don&#39;t think eszett qualifies, because Hrant asked
    for the best letter of the Latin <i>alphabet</i>. An alphabet is a set -- sometimes
    the full set but most often a subset -- of a script used to write a particular
    language. So &#39;Latin alphabet&#39; implies the letters used to write the Latin
    language, as distinct from the superset of the Latin script, which is used to
    write many languages with a great variety of alphabets.

    typically starts a new font by sketching the lowercase letters h and o on his
    Mac. Then he creates related straight letters like i from the h and round letters
    like c from the o, keeping a close eye on their weight and overall form by often
    printing them out; &#60;...&#62; He works last on more &#34;capricious&#34; characters,

  body: The thread kinda veered from Best Letter to  <BR>Most Useful Letter to Start
    With. I&#39;d agree with David. <BR>The O is a great control letter to start with
    and <BR>i like to create a B or an 8 next. <BR> <BR>About the R. <BR> <BR>If its
    a typeface that is going to have a workmanlike <BR>R, then I make the R by working
    from the B. <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s going to be an exuberant face, then I&#39;d work
    <BR>from the P and add a tail with flourish. <BR> <BR>bj
