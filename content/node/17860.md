body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nThis would be my first post here on Typophile. I've been
  searching the internet for a site that analyzes some of the more highly regarded
  typefaces in history (Baskerville, Bodoni, Gill Sans, Goudy {insert face here},
  Cooper, etc.) and deconstructs them in a fashion that describes what is conveyed
  buy each face's individual characteristics. \r\n\r\nI know that here you have the
  Typowiki reference, but this just gives a history of each typeface. I'm looking
  for a more critical analysis. Am I asking too much? Should I look at these faces
  with a broader eye? Should I look more towards the period from whence these faces
  emerged?\r\n\r\nAny links or book suggestions would be well appreciated.\r\n\r\nI
  love this website, and I find it refreshing that I wasn't the only one scratching
  out early font ideas on my notepad instead of listening to my government lecture
  in high school!\r\n\r\n.lazyeye."

  body: "I've done my diploma thesis on this topic, analysing two fonts in detail:
    RialtoDF and Syntax. Each font got a small presentation book (~50-60 pages), analysing
    formal aspects, influences like zeitgeist, technique, font designer and purpose
    of use. I chose these two fonts because they are quite different (sans serif /
    serif) but have lots of things in common (humanist ductus, ...).\r\nThe theoretical
    part describes these things in a more common way.\r\n\r\nIf you want pdfs of it,

    you ordered this from Amazon, did it cost you $94? That's what Amazon and other
    used bookstore sites (e.g., abebooks.com) seem to charge.\r\n\r\nI lucked out
    and ran across this book recently at the Strand Bookstore in NYC (www.strandbooks.com)
    for $20. I thought I bought the only copy, but it looks available online....\r\n\r\ns'marks\r\n"

    plan on selling the more used version on eBay. If anyone is interested, and can't
    find this book at strandbooks, I will post a link to the auction.\r\n\r\n.lazyeye."

  body: "OK, great, glad you didn't pay $80-$100 for it. It's not a bad reference
    book at $20, but I don't think it's worth $80. And, as others have noted, there's
    no analysis or criticism, just type samples.\r\n\r\nNow the FontBook might be
    worth $80. Didja see the guy on Amazon selling it for $1200?!\r\n\r\ns'marks\r\n"
