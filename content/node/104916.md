  \r\nI've been looking at this for too long! Can people kindly critique the brand
  mark which will be reproduced foil block on an uncoated stock. In particular I'm
  having issue with centering the text and the kerning. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDarren"

    \r\nReport \u2013 right by a little less.\r\nThe \u2013 a gnat\u2019s to the left.\r\n\r\nBut
    I am not really comfortable with the position of 2014, I think the other text
    needs to be lifted off it a touch, especially the R4 and O1 combinations.\r\n\r\nDepending
    on the final size and the budget you might be asking quite a lot of the blocker/finisher.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Pretty much agree with timd; might help to make the type a tad smaller and
    add more space between lines.

  body: "Much better, but I \uFB01nd the reversal of this style disconcerting, as
    I\u2019m reading the \u201Cshadows\u201D as foreground, not the implied type face,
    which draws attention to the thin edges as if they are serifs, which seems strange
    in a sans face; the effect is especially strong in \u201CT\u201D, \u201C2\u201D
    and \u201C1\u201D.\r\n\r\nAlso, I\u2019ve always preferred the illumination to
    come from top left. I believe that is the standard."

  body: I think the relative centering is good (especially after John's amendment),
    but I think the whole text block needs to move a touch right within the holding
    shape.

    against the background.

    contrast will be about the same.

    Shift the word \"THE\" left until the E aligns vertically with the L in WEALTH.\r\n2.
    Shift the word REPORT a tad right until the vertical stem of R in it aligns with
    the vertical stem of T above it in WEALTH;\r\n3. shift 2014 a tad right until
    the vertical stem of the 4 aligns with the vertical stem of the R above it in
    REPORT.\r\n\r\nThis will also make it feel a bit more like a table as in balance
    sheet.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TWR2014_4066.png]"

    will be about the same.\r\n\r\nBut most foils are reflective to some degree, and
    their brightness will vary depending on what they are reflecting. A matte foil
    might help but I'm not sure it'll create the effect you're after.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/foil2_3660.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut
    even if the contrast is sufficient, I still like the white version better."
