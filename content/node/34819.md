  only a slightly different angular degree, but also weight? We've just bought Freight
  for a project and noticed this slight oddity. Is it our laser printer or is there
  a slight visual difference somehow? The caps all seem slighly thicker. Is this somehow
  a weird trick of the eye or a peculiarity to the face? Any thoughts welcomed\r\n\r\nBest

  body: "Claus, I wouldn't call it a \"norm\". Mostly I would call it old-fashioned,
    often purposefully. But it can work - in fact there are two functional reasons
    why caps that stand out can make sense: it makes it easier to spot names when
    scanning a text, which is what scanning is usually for; and all-caps text, which
    tries to be strong, looks stronger.\r\n\r\nJonathan, caveat emptor I guess.\r\nI
    think it's a great font overall, but know what you're buying.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "It is the norm to a <cite>higher or lesser extent</cite> as I said. The stroke
    thickness difference between uppercase and lowercase characters have always been
    present in type. Some (stylistic) periods have accentuated this difference, others
    have minimized it, but it it always there. As Hrant says, one explanation can
    be a desire to differentiate proper nouns or nouns in languages as German where
    they are capitalized. Another explanation is the desire to adjust the stroke of
    the characters so they would be more uniform in colour, as uppercase letters have
    larger negative spaces and thus require a darker positive space to achieve a harmonious
    co-existence with the lowercase. If the stroke of the uppercase is identical with
    the lowercase in absolute terms then the uppercase letters would look too thin.
    The Freight text fonts draw inspiration from the Dutch Fleischman typeface, which
    by contemporary sensibilities look dated, but them are the breaks.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the angles of the italic down-strokes, the story is much the same. The variations
    are there for reasons of optical adjustment, period sensibilities (and print-technical
    reasons I ponder).\r\n\r\nSo no, you haven't bought a pig in a poke. Freight text
    is meant for... text. Not display setting. So when you zoom in to the details
    of Freight they might look strange and illogical, but they are there because they
    work when set in normal text sizes. Freight has a selection of complementary faces
    for display use that might come in handy in your case."

    that a little bit to avoid the caps looking too thin in relation to the lc (as
    you explain further along) versus doing that an extra amount so that the caps
    stand out. In fact the two are pretty much opposed.\r\n\r\n> in languages as German\r\n\r\nHold
    on, German is actually a language where my point doesn't apply, since <em>nouns</em>
    are capitalized, not just names. German is no good for scanning.\r\n\r\n> The
    Freight text fonts draw inspiration\r\n> from the Dutch Fleischman typeface\r\n\r\nWhat's
    strange though is that -looking at the Enschede 1908 book- Fleischmann's own Italics
    don't exhibit unusually dark or less slanted caps!\r\nSo Darden must have done
    it for another reason...\r\n\r\n> Regarding the angles of the italic down-strokes
    ...\r\n> the variations are there for reasons of optical adjustment\r\n\r\nThis
    I'm not seeing.\r\nI suspect the reason Italic caps were historically often slanted
    less than the lc was to avoid collisions with the metal kerns. But the \"standing
    out\" aspect might apply as well.\r\n\r\n> Freight text is meant for... text.
    Not display setting.\r\n\r\nThat's certainly a very good point. Jonathan, there's
    a severe limit to how much a person (especially a non-type-designer) can consciously
    gauge what works and what doesn't in a text face by focusing on individual features/letters,
    essentially because immersive reading is subconsious. To some extent you have
    to resist that temptation.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
