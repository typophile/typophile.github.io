  and thus the invitation has to be in both languages. i was wondering if anyone knew
  any german wedding faces? - all my searches get re-directed to horrible wedding
  sites and before i use Schwabacher or Fraktur, i wondered if anyone had any suggestions?
  or suggestions of where to find.\r\n\r\nalso - is Goudy a bad choice for the aboves
  american counterpart?\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you"

    many Germans remain paranoid\r\nabout blackletter, so check first. If so, use
    DIN.  ;-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    of wedding were in Chevalier or some sort of engravers or copperplate gothic.
    So I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about this. I\u2019d use just one typeface for
    the whole thing, maybe an elegant script. No blackletter (has rather a negative
    than a festive connotation)."

  body: "In this day and age, even for traditional weddings people tend to print their
    invitations for themselves. So they'd use whatever they find on their computer
    and seems \xBBelegant\xAB to them.\r\n\r\nIf they have a Mac, these would be the
    likeliest candidates: Apple Chancery, Zapfino, Palation Italic, Times Italic.\r\n\r\nIf
    they know a designer with a Creative Suite, Bickham Script Pro.\r\n\r\nYou could
    get an impression by image-googling for \xBBHochzeitseinladung\xAB."

  body: "The suggestion by Andreas of Reinstaedt and Canterbury Sans seem to strike
    a good note as alternatives to the old style engraved fonts.\r\nHere are card
    mockups with typefaces that may meet contemporary German tastes, as sold by Shutterstock
    -- they provide them under the category \"Hochzeitseinladung\"--  http://www.shutterstock.com/s/hochzeitseinladung/search.html
    The cards show a good range of typefaces that you could use in your own designs.
    Shutterstock does not name the typefaces but most are fairly obvious. If you don't
    recognize any that you find attractive, just pop the question over at the font
    ID board http://typophile.com/typeid\r\nDon"
