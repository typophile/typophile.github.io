  body: 'In the Dover Solotype catalog there are a few candidates, but who knows if
    they are digitized -- &#39;Barnum Square&#34; &amp; &#34;Old Town&#34; &#40;p.25&#41;.
    On  the previous page there is one called &#34;Warlord&#34; and another called
    &#34;Wigwam&#34; that also have similar characteristics. The obvious digital fonts
    I know, like P.T. Barnum, Wanted and Playbill are not the same. <BR> <BR>What
    is the source of the image? Does it possibly come from before the 1990&#39;s? '

    the overall feel  <BR>is spot on. Is that close enough for you?
