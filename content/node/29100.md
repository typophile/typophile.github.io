  The typetester works exactly as I want it to if I genereate my fonts in TrueType
  format. Then the typetester displays all character sets correct. It displays \xE5
  \xE4 \xF6 and all the mathematical and accented characters exaclty as they are.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  since I only produce OpenType fonts, I would very much be able to use OpenType fonts
  to render the images instead. But any OpenType font makes the TypeTester forget
  about the accented charachters, and some characters becomes mixed up with others.\r\n\r\nI
  think it\u2019s about some encoding issue, but I havent got the slightes idea on
  what to do.\r\n\r\nIs there some \"trick\" I could do when exporting my OpenType
  fonts for the Typetester for it to work the same way as a TrueType font when it
  comes to displaying characters? Maybe some Encoding option in FontLab?\r\n \r\nIn
  that case I dont have to do a TrueType version of the font specific for the tester.\r\n\r\nThe
  OpenType rendered images also gets more smooth, so the font looks better with OpenType
  format...\r\n\r\nThe typetester can be seen at:\r\nhttp://autodidakt.se/index.php?page=autostyler\r\n\r\nAnyone
  around here with these kind of knowledge?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m forever grateful for all
  help.\r\n\r\n"

    you tried your TypeTester with Minion, for example? Does it work?"

  body: "Nope. No, OpenType font actually works with the tester fully. Well, it works,
    but some characters are missing and some gets mixed up.\r\n\r\nAt the same time
    it\u2019s rather strange that if I just export as a .ttf it works fine. I dont
    need to do anything else, isnt that strange?\r\n\r\nI was thinking that _if_ I
    export an OpenType font with the same kind of encoding as a TrueType font, it
    may work, but I dont know the main principles on what differ them both.\r\n\r\nThe
    Typetester is written for TrueType fonts, I know that, but since \"half\" of the
    OpenType font works, it must be a way to make the whole work aswell. (?)\r\n\r\nI
    guess my main question really is, what is the real difference between a Truetype
    and an OpenType when it comes this matter?\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the difference in
    the encoding-things? Is there some things that I could try perhaps in the Font
    options in Fontlab, I\u2019ve seen there is a lot to choose (cmap etc...)\r\n\r\nMaybe
    it\u2019s not that simple, but I\u2019m just reaching out and trying to learn
    :)\r\n\r\n(The very helpful person who helped me create the tester is however
    going to give it a try and see if there is some code that could be re-written
    in the tester)"

  body: "I am supremely confident that someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but...\r\n\r\nThe
    Truetype fonts which Fontlab produces are, in fact, Opentype fonts, but TTF-flavored
    instead of CFF flavored. However, in order for the TTF fonts to carry the .otf
    extension, they must be digitally signed, while the CFF fonts do not require the
    dsig. In any event, it has been my experience the TTF-flavor fonts seems to behave
    better overall that the CFF versions. I suspect this may be because Adobe has
    a few bugs to work out...which is perhaps why a new and improved version of the
    OT FDK is under development.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, why don't you go with what
    works? Generate TTF fonts to use on your website and continue to sell your OTF
    fonts."

  body: "> <em>in order for the TTF fonts to carry the .otf extension</em>\r\n\r\nThis
    part is incorrect. An OpenTpe-TTF font will never have a .otf extension. One of
    the reasons why a TTF font needs to be digitally signed, is so it gets the correct
    icon under Windows.\r\n\r\n> <em>I suspect this may be because Adobe has a few
    bugs to work out\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nYep, we spend a lot of time working out bugs,
    especially the ones in OSes and non-Adobe apps... :^/\r\n\r\n> <em>which is perhaps
    why a new and improved version of the OT FDK is under development.</em>\r\n\r\nLike
    any other app, the FDK is (and has been) _always_ under development. The reason
    why you're currently hearing a lot of buzz about it, is because all the version
    between 1.6 and 2.0 were not made public. The last release (v1.6) before the current
    one, had been made available more than three years ago."

    I know, probably that is the best thing to do \u2013 but I\u2019m the kind of
    person that sometimes just can\u2019t let things be as they are or accept that
    it\u2019s not optimal and adjust to that. It gives me some kind of \"itch\" ;-)"

    obscure trivia point, but... actually, it is perfectly legal for it to do so.
    The reason for it to have a .ttf extension is purely for backwards compatibility.
    Microsoft has often made noises that they may change all their .ttf extensions
    to .otf one of these days.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thomas, \r\n\r\nthanks for bringing it up. Indeed, it is correct to assume
    and rely on the fact that a font file with a .ttf extension is an OpenType TT
    font, but a font file with an .otf extension may be either an OpenType PS font
    or an OpenType TT font. I haven't yet seen any retail OT TT fonts with an .otf
    extension but I'm sure it's only a matter of time until they appear. \r\n\r\nAdam"
