Here&rsquo;s a little update. I did up the lowercase except for k, and the g still needs a lot of work. On screen the lowercase letters look HUGE next to their UC counterparts, but it all looks fine on paper. Something feels wrong, helll I can see it&rsquo;s wrong, but I am not sure why.

<p>That&rsquo;s OK I can critique myself.</p>
<p>The lc a has the most character of these characters, but the lower curve needs to be smoothed out a bit.
That f is a joke, right? Just an upturned j with a cross bar. I do like those inset curled ball terminals on the f, t, and j, though. Hard to say if that feature fits in with an otherwise wide font though. Try stretching them out, like the tail on the Q.</p>
<p>Keep working on that g. The line weights seem about right but it&rsquo;s still too dark.</p>

<p>The firs thing I&rsquo;d do though is the uc H.  While the U traditionally has two different stresses on the vertical strokes, the H does not, both are thick.</p>
<p>I like the inset balls.  But push the ball of the r in some.  you can have skinny rs and be okay.</p>
<p>Also, a problem I noticed I had in Coruña the other day you have too&hellip;. the Ss look like they were made with entirely different angles and curves.  both fit the font, but they don&rsquo;t fit each other I don&rsquo;t think, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>Can you provide some text in your sample? I realize you may not have done spacing yet, but it&rsquo;s still helpful for judging letter forms.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve made some improvements and d most of the letters look a lot better, but when I did a test text print at 12pt it looked absolutely terrible! There is a problem of uneven color to say the very least (not that even color is a supreme goal in and of its self, but well, you&rsquo;ll see soon enough.) The thin parts of the high-contrast strokes frequently disappeared at that size. Clearly this isn&rsquo;t meant to be used so small, but it&rsquo;s too wide for titling. Maybe its destiny is in signage?</p>
<p>The x-height is huge, so much that the lowercase overpowers the caps. &rsquo;m not sure how this can be repaired.Making the cap stems heavier might help.</p>
<p>I want to give it another pass before I show a new sample, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be too long now.</p>

I think it&rsquo;s too wide, the x-height too high, and also i think the letters are unexpectedly round. I love the lowercase &ldquo;t&rdquo; and &ldquo;j&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m no expert, so my critique goes at the whole concept, and it is very dependent on which direction choose.</p>
<p>UC: The top left serif of &ldquo;N&rdquo; is wierd. &ldquo;W&rdquo; bothers me, and the left stroke on &ldquo;Æ&rdquo; falling from the E-shape serif as well. The lower part of B ends straight on the right side of the stem, but &ldquo;E&rdquo; is rounded. Is that done on purpose?</p>

<p>Yes, I found that the B looked way too heavy with all the internal corners rounded. Squaring that one kept it balanced to my eyes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do with the Ws . I may have to beat them with a mallet. I agree with you on the faults of the lowercase. the x-height and overshoots are what you&rsquo;d expect for a text face, but with the extreme contrast that would be impossible in this case. I&rsquo;ll try tightening them up a bit.</p>

&ldquo;S&rdquo; and &ldquo;s&rdquo; are both a bit wide in my eyes.
The mid section of &ldquo;W&rdquo; and &ldquo;w&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t really work.
The right leg on &ldquo;k&rdquo; should stretch further out to the right.
The thin stroke on lc &ldquo;x&rdquo; still doesn&rsquo;t visually align.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about those numerals. I think 5, 3 and 7 look great, but the others need some more work.</p>

<p>You will notice a lot of changes this time, some small, others far less subtle than previous go-arounds.</p>
<p>Nearly all the lowercase are slightly narrower, the H is symmetrical, the inset ball terminals have been replaced with hairline hooks, the J has a spurred hook, the leg spurs on K and R have been replaced with convex curves, ear of g and tail of y are relaxed a bit, new tail on the Q, modification to the ß, leg of k adjusted, several of the numbers have been redone (the 6 and 8 still bother me, though they are improved) and a bunch of smaller changes throughout.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Jason,
I think there are some interesting quirks in the shapes and the experimental feel of this is nice, so there&rsquo;s no reason this shouldn&rsquo;t be even better than Jeanne Moderno that you referenced. 
However, I do agree with some of the comments earlier. I think there&rsquo;s a bit of disharmony between the terminals as well. 
In particular, to my eye, it looks like there&rsquo;s something missing on f and j&rsquo;s terminals. I like the barbs on C and G but somehow it doesn&rsquo;t work so well for me the other way up on the J. I&rsquo;d make k&rsquo;s lower leg fancier somehow. g and s look oval when I think they could be rounder, look at the eszett&rsquo;s curve. The tail of Q feels a bit small. The dip of the V and v looks a bit left of centre and I would nudge it right. I don&rsquo;t like Ww and aæ either. On adu the tail looks a bit floating next to the overshooting curve of the bowls. 
The numerals are really interesting, I like the grooves in 137. Can you put a similar white cut into the 8 (where the hairline crosses the diagonal), or disconnect the ends there? Your alternate 2 and 4 are great.
Look forward to seeing how this develops :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thought I&rsquo;d weigh in, since my types have been mentioned. :)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interesting stuff going on in your alternates. REALLY interesting stuff that&rsquo;s not quite syncing with your basic alphabet.</p>
<p>Such as in your second esset, @, copyright symbol that could carry your face in a whole, cool direction.</p>
<p>LOVE that second alternate 2 - it&rsquo;s very &hellip; Eastern European.</p>
<p>Leslie Carbarga says it in his Font/Lettering Bible (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing): anything goes, even mistakes - but once you make your decision, repeat it and do it often.</p>
<p>I see lots of little decisions here - but they&rsquo;re not consistent throughout.</p>
<p>For example, consider taking your @ construction and applying the cool 3D-like strokes to your other characters. You could even build an entire alphabet from the way you structured your @! The smooth stroke on the bottom with the calligraphic flourish, really interesting treatment. What would your other letters look like if they had this treatment? Lowercase y, God, even the tail on the Q would benefit sooo much!</p>
<p>Some other thoughts:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to throw a lot away (edit!) in favor of getting everything cohesive/working well together. You should see the cutting room floor on any of my fonts!</p>
<p>When researching 19th Century Fat Faces, I&rsquo;ve run across a lot of unusual edges and components that you could also be incorporating. With all the small foundries (that eventually made up ATF) producing very odd versions of Modern type, there&rsquo;s a lot to reference and build off of; just apply what you find in a consistent manner.</p>
<p>Bodoni himself was a tinkering fool - with the money and resources to overwork his lettering ad nauseam. Octavo.com has a great digital version of his specimen book, there&rsquo;s a TON of stuff in there that to this day still hasn&rsquo;t been mined (except for a few font designers who have been building off of it). Look at Bodoni&rsquo;s odd numbers - and imagine all your round shapes going in that half moon direction. That would be SOOOO cool.</p>
<p>Really, this is a display face, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be totally legible. (did I actually say that? That&rsquo;s so not me.)</p>
<p>Stop looking at Tiffany, it seems to be holding you back (my opinion). What you&rsquo;re doing is different than Tiffany&rsquo;s approach, you could actually end up doing something better.</p>
<p>Stop looking at my fonts, they seem to be taking you in my direction and really, you have potential to do something unique here if you just create something totally &hellip; You. You have some incredible elements in there - you just have to focus on a few of them and go for it.</p>
<p>The name is good. Memorable. But if you really don&rsquo;t like it, that&rsquo;s up to you. Some of the best fonts do have horrible names.</p>
<p>Also: take your time. Focus on one letter and work that until its finished. Then work it again. Trying to do a whole alphabet at once will just drive you mad and you&rsquo;ll end up with some good forms and some forms that haven&rsquo;t been fully realized. DON&rsquo;T RUSH IT and you&rsquo;ll have a better product!</p>
<p>And insane as this sounds, I spent 10 years on Jeanne Moderno. Rod Cavazos saw my first sketches back in 1998 and it&rsquo;s been a really fun journey, I&rsquo;ve learned a TON about modern types - and I&rsquo;m no where near finished yet (there is more jeanne on the drawing board)</p>
<p>:)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>While the first version (caps only in a day and a half) seems rushed, it was little more than a sketch. I just sketch directly in FontForge sometimes. It helps to keep my thoughts organized, though it is limiting in its way. (I sketch type on paper too but it seldom looks like this).</p>
<p>Effluent is a pretty sounding word that is synonymous with sewage. It nicely reflects the low self-esteem of this designer, but I question whether that will impair its marketability.</p>
<p>Likewise, the alternates I show are also largely sketches or designs I&rsquo;ve rejected from the main line; most will likely be eliminated from the final font but they may see life in another project. I&rsquo;ve already tossed out those inset ball terminals I had on f,j and t, and the barb on J is gone in the next version.</p>
<p>Thank you Steve for your input. I only mentioned Jeanne Moderno as a point of comparison since it is broadly in the same genre of high-contrast modern type that has recently in everyone&rsquo;s face here since it became featured here on Typophile. I hadn&rsquo;t even been aware of it before then. Sorry about that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The problem with the W/w may stem from trying to maintain the same angles as V and A.

But if I change the angles, they start looking wonky other ways. I&rsquo;ll have to try again on those.</p>
<p>The thing I really can&rsquo;t figure out is what to do with the b and q serif. I don&rsquo;t like the ones they have and am tempted to give them the curl like on a, d, p, and r, but I&rsquo;m not so sure that&rsquo;s right on all the places it already is.</p>

<p>I made the parentheses, braces, and brackets vertically asymmetric. I think it was so they&rsquo;d look good with either lowercase or all-caps or number settings without a baseline shift. I&rsquo;ll have to thoroughly test them to see if they actually do that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice work. The ball terminal off the top of the number 4 strikes me as not quite fitting. But that&rsquo;s the only thing so far that&rsquo;s sticking out to me. As for the lowercase serifs - well you can&rsquo;t really terminate them with a ball approach (at least I can&rsquo;t see that being feasible for most of the LC) . So hook or perhaps a slim flattened serif (like your UC letters have) may be the only real options. Hope this helps.</div>
