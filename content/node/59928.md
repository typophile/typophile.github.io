body: "When I arrived at work this morning and turned on my computer I had an e-mail
  about an upcoming project. As I mentioned in my last entry, I am getting my feet
  wet with e-mail marketing and have become the go-to-guy on the subject. The e-mail
  started with a few basic technical questions that came up in conversation with a
  customer. It then said that as a means of convincing the customer to go with us
  for there e-newsletter, we (I) would come up with a design of what it would look
  like and help advise them on the content.\r\n\r\nThis sounds an awful lot like spec
  work to me. I am a member of AIGA and another regional advertising organization,
  both of whom, have a firm stance against spec work. To play devil's advocate however,
  this particular client is an existing customer of other materials and give us steady
  business. Does that make spec work like this \"more acceptable?\"\r\n\r\nAs the
  newest, youngest, designer at this company I don't necessarily have a lot of clout
  yet in the way the business is run so what is the best way to handle a situation
  like this. I am being told by a superior to do something that is unethical in the
  industry but in the same token, we have a \"customers always right\" attitude. Is
  it best to grin and bear or should I express my opinion on this particular issue?
  It is not really a common practice in my company but it is also not the very first
  time I've seen things like this happen."

    existing clients to help them 'visualize' prior to project launch. It really depends
    on how much I like the client. ;o)\r\n3) Spec work, while frowned upon, is certainly
    not unheard of. In large firms it's often relabeled/disguised as 'detailed pitch'.\r\n4)
    You are getting a salary, right? So at least in your case, you, yourself, aren't
    doing any spec work. ;)"

    balance between good customer service and letting yourself get walked on sometimes.
