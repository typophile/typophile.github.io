body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThis is my first post on this forum, but i've been reading
  it for some time now. I'm not a very good typographer, so therfor my post. \r\nCurrently
  i'm - pro bono - doing a design on a a logo (+ID) for a charity non-profit organisation.
  They were called GNSI which stands for Ghana Netherlands Schoolfeeding Initiative.
  I've already convinced them changing the name in SIGN. \r\n\r\nThe Identity should:\r\n\r\na.
  Reflect what they're doing\r\nb. Have a professional (non activism) appearance /
  and be positive\r\n\r\nSIGN's main activities are:\r\n1. nutrition\r\n2. education\r\n3.
  (economical) developement\r\n\r\nI've tried to capture this in the ID by creating
  a iconic alphabet. The style is referring to schools (and cutout / potato stamps).\r\nThe
  logo is not a fixed logo, but a constantly changing combination of icons and a 'wordmark'
  (for eg different on letterheads and businesscards). This is because I feel that
  the icons themself should not represent the organisation. (added two examples of
  possible logo). \r\n\r\nI would appreciate some pointers and critique.\r\nThanks...\r\n"

  body: 'With your explanation I see what you have done & it makes sense. I even like
    to look of it.  But without the explanation I would be quite confused. Making
    icons to work in this way is something that rarely works well. Many many ideas
    resist iconization or rely on cutural factors that change. The idea of econmomic
    developemet strikes me as falling strongly into this category or ''resitive''
    ideas. So I don''t recommend the icon route. What about making letters out of
    many symbols like the univelier logo - then you could include much more.  What
    about A sigbn that says ''sign''? It would be confusing but also create an oportunity
    to talk about what it is. I am sure there are many many other possibilities. Keep
    going. '

    that in choosing a typeface for a charitable organization you're looking for something
    that isn't too cold, however I think something a little slicker would seem more
    professional and instill more confidence.\r\n\r\nJust my thoughts."

  body: "I don't mind it, though I did view the logo prior to reading your comments
    and concept. My imediate reaction was oh right ... SIGN FACTORY which on reflection
    is completely off beat.\r\n\r\nI certainly don't think the current logo holds
    much (if any) sense of community or approachability. Perhaps it's just the rigidity
    of the box.\r\n\r\n\r\n<label><a href=\"http://www.solid-creative.com\">Communication
