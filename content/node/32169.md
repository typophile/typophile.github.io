  body: 'Eurostile would be one place to start, but I''m betting there are closer
    options -- faces that already have the slight tail on the l, for example. No time
    to look, but I''d check foundries that have a lot of geometric sans: You Work
    For Them, Lineto, T26, Die Gestalten, Thirstype...'

  body: I don't disagree with you Marc, but the tails on the l's are sharp/angled
    not curved like most of the sans fonts out there. I do agree that Apex is a close
    fit for the font based on the e's (less oval and more rounded rectangle), which
    is also similar to Eurostile/Microgramma. Based on the letterforms, we're both
    right.
