  recently joined a large magazine that comes as a supplement in a newspaper) for
  the past three years. I have just been promoted to creative director of the entire
  newspaper, which includes its broadsheet, a supplement and a separate magazine supplement
  that I have been creative director of.\r\n\r\nAs such, given my experience with
  magazines, a newspaper is quite the change. I recently redesigned the magazine as
  creative director of that, and that is the reason I have been promoted essentially.
  \r\n\r\nThat's just some background. We are purchasing Type Together's Coranto 2
  and LFT Etica as a serif-sans pair, but everyone seems to want to keep the masthead
  font, which is set in Utopia Display. I think it is really quite poor, but then
  that is probably because most mastheads on newspapers are essentially custom variations
  of fonts. But Utopia is not a font I like anyway, and it does look desperately generic.
  It just doesn't look nice.\r\n\r\nAre there any fonts similar to Utopia, but with
  a bit of flare and originality (I know this is an oxymoron given I'm not a fan of
  Utopia) that could go and replace the masthead font? Or does anyone have any suggestions
  for one? It has to stay serif.\r\n\r\nYour help would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: The current masthead is not all caps, and it's just standard Utopia Display.
    However, I wouldn't mind selecting a similar font in its semibold weight, but
    Utopia's semibold is too heavy for me.

  body: How about Kepler? It is similar to Utopia but more refined, and the display
    cut seems to have a "classical", timeless newspaper feel.

    Or hire a logo designer, or type designer, to tweak the masthead? 'm sure TypeTogether
    could do something nice. Or hire somebody else.\r\n\r\nBTW, here is what I think
    is a good example from my own work of tweaking a font into a logo, where I started
    with TypeTogether's Adelle: http://blog.extensis.com/creative-fuel/brand-refresh-new-logo-decision-time.php
    (start about halfway down to see where things start to get some direction and
    come together)."
