body: "For about a week new I've had what appears to be a few corrupt fonts that I
  just can't get rid of in my Indesign CS2 font menus. The name of the fonts are corrupt,
  and when I try to use them I get an error message stating that the fonts cannot
  be printed because the outline files are missing. I've checked and cleaned up my
  user, system, and indesign fonts directories as well as clearing all application
  and system font caches. I have also nuked all the old adobefnt.lst files. Nothing
  has removed the screwy font. Here's a screenshot of it in the menu:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wtf_6422.gif]\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?"

  body: download a program called 'font finagler', it deletes all the crappy preferences,
    etc... and forces indesign to rebuild its libraries... sorts the majority of problems

  body: I've used Font Finagler to blast everything, it doesn't work. I've also searched
    the entire filesystem with spotlight and using find as root and there's nothing
    coming up. The problem is only happening with Indesign and Illustrator CS2, so
    I'm pretty sure it's somehow tied to those. I checked /system/library/application
    support/adobe/fonts and there's nothing odd in there, either.

  body: For some reason, the odd name of the font suggests it might have been used
    in a PDF file at some point. (Was the font extracted from a PDF, perhaps?)

  body: I didn't explicitly extract it from one, but I've placed a PDF containing
    the fonts into another document, is it possible that Indesign grabbed the font
    then and has it stashed somewhere?

  body: AFAIK, new fonts don't become available in the Font Menu just because a PDF
    file was placed in the InDesign document, but I could be wrong. What happens if
    you remove the placed PDF?
