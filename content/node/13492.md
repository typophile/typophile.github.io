  (FE=f\xE4lschungserschwerend), the <em>difficult to forge narrow face</em>, has
  been the official font used in the manufacture of German license plates since about
  1995.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1970s, a terrorist band named the Red Army Faction (RAF)
  preyed upon West Germany. One of their tactics was apparently the forging of license
  plate numbers to evade police. At the time, [[Karlgeorg Hoefer]] was commissioned
  to design an \"unforgable\" alphabet. The result was a series of letters or numbers,
  which could not be changed into any other by the simple addition or removal or a
  stroke or element. Somehow, the government lost interest in Hoefers project. Maybe
  the RAF just went away\u2026\r\n\r\nIn the 1990s, the new, reunified German government
  decided to make new license plates. They wanted a to use a typeface whose letters
  were all different from one another, but which could be differentiated from one
  another by radar/computer readers. They could have picked an existing font like
  OCR B, but they didn't.\r\n\r\nA design based on Hoefer's experiment was put in
  place, sadly, to almost universal derision by the public and other designers."
