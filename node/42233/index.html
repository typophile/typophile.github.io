Hey Charles, on that interview, do you remember Peter Saville specifically saying it was 9pt Helvetica?

Go to the YouTube I posted and see version 4 to hear about the cover design. Stockport is south Manchester and where I have spent lots of time.

Note the 'FACTUS 1' on it which means FACT US no. 1 as in the USA version 1.00 release the first US release by Factory Records.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It is not Helvetica because the lowercase 'a' right side goes straight down and does not have an extenstion like Helv. Also the figure 'one' in Helvetica doesn't have a straight top extenstion but a curved one. The parens are spot on Univers as is the lowercase 'g', comma, and numerals.

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm... It was a while ago I watched the documentary, which was called, 'Factory- From Joy Division to Happy Mondays' on BBC. I definitely remember him saying about the reluctance to include type on the outer sleeve, but I can't be sure about the 9pt Helvetica comment, I may have just imagined this, or its a mis-informed comment I've heard somewhere?

Until now, I've always just presumed it was Helvetica, but never really studied it up close... so I was wrong to say it definitely IS without checking - sorry.

After more investigation, I now agree with Lex & Miss Tiffany - It's got to be Univers.

As I was checking my recently purchased 12" Remastered Vinyl (2007) it has thrown up an interesting point. The UNKNOWN PLEASURES title appears to be set in DIN or Akzidenz? 
 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UP_4290.jpg]

If you check out the next image, a sticker from the back, it claims to have 'original artwork' - I don't think so!

The sticker also reveals that the artwork was 're-editioned' by 'Something Else'... I think they have some explaining to do... I'm feeling a little cheated here![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sticker_3482.jpg]</div>

compare the lowercase 'y' and figure '2' Univers has a straight y and 2 not curved or with a hook ending.

This is the 1980 FACTUS1 original back cover. 

on your recent one it probably only refers to the image as being a reproduction since most people don't call type 'artwork' so they probably 'remastered' the typography.

Again the figure 1, lc 'a' and 'y' and 'parens' are all Univers.

On your newly purchased 'remastered' one I like th (P) registered product symbol, you don't see that in fonts very much.

Also I doubt the US version was the same as the UK version since very few LPs or CD are the same since they are usually produced locally. I have many US and UK CDs that are the same and My wife who's a Manc has UK version of the ones I have as US. Her UK Suede Cds aren't the same as my US 'London' Suede (??? they are Mancs!) and the songs are different.

And to be honest I'm surprised I have the US version of Unknown Pleasures since most of the LPs I have from back then were 'Imported' since the first versions were never producted in the US until much later. </div>
