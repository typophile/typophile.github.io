  body: I&#39;m very sorry we&#39;re unable to identify your logo, Terri. There&#39;s
    a possibility <BR>this is a custom drawn design. What&#39;s the logo from?

  body: Yves, <BR>It&#39;s scanned from a business card. <BR> <BR>I have a feeling
    you are right, that it was custom-drawn along with the graphic element that&#39;s
    also part of their logo. <BR> <BR>Funny, the reason we need to reproduce it is
    because Rubloff bought a controlling interest in the company I work for! but we
    can&#39;t seem to find anyone who can supply us with original art for the logo!
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for trying. --Terri
