    body: I designed the @mosphere Restaurant logo. Its actually based on a TTF font
      called [edited by moderator], but I've been looking for an alternative with
      more than one weight for some time and very useful to find Peignot which looks
      identical. Out of interest what are you using the font for Chan?

    Too funny, calling the original \"identical\" to the rip-off. :^)\r\n\r\nBTW I
    removed the name of the pirate copy. Internal policy and stuff."
