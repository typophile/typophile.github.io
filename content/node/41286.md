  body: In a few ways it reminds me of Champion Heavyweight with a stroke added. A
    little squooshed too, vertically I mean.

  body: "The closest was Knockout 94, but it wasn't a match(see below). I don't know
    if the added stroke trick would fill this out to match it. I think Stephen has
    a list of ultrabold fonts. Maybe that would help.\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Knockout94_5449.gif]"

  body: Avant Garde was published in the late '60s/early '70s, so this is pre-digital.
    Good suggestions from Tiffany and Mike, though.

  body: Thanks all. I think Champion is closest; I could mess with it in Fontographer
    to get it closer to the AG type. Now how do I buy it without having to buy a bunch
    of other weights I'll never use??
