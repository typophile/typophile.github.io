    target="_blank">http://www.inkjetmall.com</a> <BR>They have lots of free tutorials
    if you poke around their site.  Also, check out the Epson site, you may need the
    correct PPD files por whatever is used in the PC world.  Most high-end color calibration
    and workflow for graphics and publishing is done on a Mac so their is a lot more
    Mac info about.  It CAN be done on a PC &#40;so they tell me&#41; but I have no

    but maybe someone here has had a more fortunate experience and can enlighten you.
