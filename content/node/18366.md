  body: This could be a font -- there are identical shapes. This doesn't guarantee
    anything though.

  body: "I'm not as convinced that there are identical shapes there, even though the
    'd's, for example look similar. At that image size I don't see any proof that
    this wasn't hand-drawn.  My other reason for saying this is that I would have
    collected a font like this for the Script Font ID Guide, and it doesn't look familiar.
    \r\n\r\nSimilar fonts I can think of are <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/croissant-sh/>Croissant</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Jellybaby>ITC Jellybaby</a>.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Identical shapes doesn't mean it wasn't hand drawn - they could have copied
    their own letterforms.

    may be a possible substitute.
