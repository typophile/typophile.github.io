  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

I'm designing some covers for a client and they've asked me to give them one alternative using a particular font called Agenda (see sample below). As I haven't got it and they aren't sure they want to use it anyway I wondered if there might be a free shareware alternative which might be similar just to get by until they decide what they prefer.

Anyone know of anything as I've looked and found a few but think the curles on some of the letters (such as L's) are quite extreme.

Thanks.

Say What? I'm not sure what's unclear about FontShop sublicensing Font Bureau fonts, as they have done with little or no confusion since 1989. I could understand if they charged differently than us, or offered a different set or a subset of styles but niether of those situations exist. And "the FontFont range of typefaces" is what?

Yves, 'm not sure what your gripe is either. Where exactly is the marketing nonsense of which you speak?

		<div class="commentbody">David - I've been following the business side of type for a little while and I have the impression -- I could very well be completely wrong -- that the way certain typefaces are bundled and discounted make them look "cheap". I often have had discussions with end users, trying to convince them that digital type is a product of intrinsic value. Basically it's really hard to make them see type licenses should be paid for, not just exchanged amongst friends and colleagues.

When four weights of Today Sans are lumped in with some other fonts and then sold for $19.95, it tends to get difficult to explain why a single weight should retail for $39.50. And even more so when InDesign CS comes with a.o. complete high quality OpenType families like Adobe Caslon Pro, Adobe Garamond Pro, Adobe Jenson Pro and Adobe Warnock Pro. Make no mistake, I'm happy to have those with my software, but I suspect this might make the lives of independent font foundries a little harder.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with you, Yves, but I also see something else. I'll try to explain. I'm going to generalize and so might step on some toes. I'm not trying to insult anyone, I promise.

People who license type are not one sort of people. There are many shades of gray. Some people do have an eye for good type but would never, ever, pay $39.50 for a font. No matter what. But they would pay $19.95 for a quickie bundle. 

Then there are those who wouldn't buy an inexpensive font bundle because they'd wonder if there were hidden strings attached. 

Then there are those who are in the middle somewhere. They know fonts are tools and need them for their toolbox. They can't always afford the most expensive and so bundles such as this might ingratiate them to a foundry because they were able to use some of their fonts for less money.

I could see using bundling, from a foundries point of view, as a way to get the lower end of the spectrum to consider using more of their fonts. 

Yes, in some ways it makes one wonder about the worth of a typeface. But the truth of the matter is that it is a success just to have someone licensing the font instead of downloading it. 

Perhaps this is clear as mud.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen, thanks for the clarification...Yves you do more than follow, I 've been chasing some of your ideas for years. but..."When four weights of Today Sans are lumped in with some other fonts and then sold for $19.95...explain why a single weight should retail for $39.50"

Because, they don't have a license for it, that's why.

Explaining to someone that fonts must be bundled should not be too hard: no user of any supported language of the OS should have to go out and buy fonts to enable use of the OS and its bundled apps. 

The fewer and fewer applications that come separate from the OS, must come with enough fonts so that any user wishing to make any kind of document you've Ever seen before will not have to go out and buy more fonts. 

Then there are bundles that are not associated with OS or Application, and those are targeted at users of other products and or services where people need to make documents like you've Never see before.

Then, and in order to go on, the definition of independent font foundries needs to be estabilshed as what? — those foundries who do not involve their fonts in bundling? 

I think perhaps you hear people who have an IP-IQ problem?

Here is a good test: PCs of all kinds from the Huskiest Desktop to the Invisiible Nosephone come bundled with music. Do all users find themselves content with the bundled music? What are their choices in aftermarket bundled music? Does any of this have anything to do with the indy musicman (relative to digital technologies effects)?

If people think intellectual property is not worth 39.95, but want to use it anyways, then they are breaking the law. It's not that some fonts are free or cheaper that make them do it is it? 

Tiffany says, "People who license type are not one sort of people" which I heartily agree with, and I think it goes without saying that "People who don't license type, are one sort of people." :)
