body: Hi, I&#39;m using Fontlab in a Mac. I want to know how must export a font in
  TT format for PC. I mean, the &#34;regular&#34; o normal settings for a regular
  font. I&#39;m making a pixel font, and have no problem with mac with default settings.
  But in PC i&#39;ts not working. Can&#39;t get the exact size. In my case 8 points.
  Hope you understand my poor english. Thanx in advance.

    default at 96 dpi not 72 like Mac.

    like you are dealing with screen resolution problem, try setting the PC version
    of the font at a smaller size. Not sure if this will help or not.'

  body: IIRC, Microsoft has an article about bitmap fonts on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography"
    target="_blank"> their site</a>. PC fonts need to be 11ppem to appear as 8 points.
    13ppem if they&#39;re displaying on SVGA &#40;120dpi&#41;.

  body: Thanks for the answers. I was trying and see that if I use 1330 UPM in Fontlab
    &#40;to compensate the 96 dpi in PC screens&#41; I can get my font to work well
    at 10 points in PC. <BR>It&#39;s than OK? What happens if someone use a screen
    resolution of 72? Sorry, but I&#39;m a Mac user. Thanks a lot.

  body: 'Grisel,  <BR> <BR>it is fully OK to use a 1330 UPM. However, it is indeed
    the case that ideally, you need to consider all major screen ppi settings to be
    sure that your font works well on all systems. Use the formula:  <BR>&#40;ppem
    size&#41; = &#40;dpi density&#41; / 72 &#42; &#40;point size&#41; <BR>And use
    at least following dpi densities:  <BR>72 &#40;MacOS&#41; <BR>96 &#40;Windows
    &#34;small fonts&#34;&#41; <BR>120 &#40;Windows &#34;large fonts&#34;&#41; <BR>
    <BR>This means, that, for example, for bitmaps to appear at 10 points, you should
    include bitmaps for 10, 13 and 17 ppem.  <BR> <BR>Adam'
