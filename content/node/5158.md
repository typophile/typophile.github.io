body: Does anybody know the typeface used for the &#34;PARENTAL ADVISORY EXPLICIT
  MATERIAL&#34; logo? <BR> <BR>And... am  I in breach of copyright if I use it on
  promotional material?  <BR> <BR>Because, it will reflect the offensive material
  found in the art gallery which I am promoting, and isn&#39;t that its purpose!?
  <BR> <BR>I hope I haven&#39;t created a monster with the question. <BR> <BR>Font
  used for the logo, my original question. Not sure if it has been stretched or not.

    was a good Keyword for that and doesn&#39;t show up. <BR>And the thing is that
    I don&#39;t  see any Archive Folder in the Type Identification Board between June
    06 2004 and September 23 2003... Is it just me?

  body: I don&#39;t think this has anything to do with movie ratings. I think this
    is the logo he means. There were a few variations on the font used but most used
    a compressed gothic &#40;impact, compacta?&#41;. The bottom either says lyrics
    or Explicit content. The last logo is one of the earliest. It had a different
    font. &#40;I think Aachen for &#34;advisory&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37954.jpg"

  body: The font on the one on the left is Helvetica Compressed or Helvetica Ultra
    Compressed. Or Extra Compressed. One or possibly more of those, anyway.

  body: The one on the far right is more than one font &#40;note the Rs&#41; which
    have been manually compressed and extended.  <BR> <BR>Middle is the best if you
    ask me.

  body: I want to make a shirt for pregnant women that reads &#34;Prenatal Advisory.&#34;
    I don&#39;t know what the bottom text would be, though. But I think it would be
    a whole lot cooler than the old &#34;Baby on Board&#34; signs...
