  body: "Left column looks like an educational logo, kids-oriented. Middle column
    looks like a shampoo product line, specifically - [[http://www.stuff4beauty.com/pics/ultra-shampoo.jpg|Biolage]].
    \r\n\r\nBetween the options in the last column, the second from the top in the
    left sub-column looks nice and reasonably appropriate. The bottom three options
    don't really work for me. I would rather keep 'E' as a mark and render Elmsmere
    Associates a standalone text (similar to the top set of options in the last column).\r\n"

    my client said they like the idea of the elm tree standing for being solid and

  body: "<ol>\r\n<li>First pack with trees has unbalanced details. they have too much
    detail in the tree and some of them are dubious when you think of pure black/white
    logo. They look like clipart combined with type. Not a logo in this version.</li>\r\n<li>Second
    pack that imitates green leaf under E. leaf looks somehow distorted but otherwise
    still no distincion that would make it a logo.</li>\r\n<li>Squared E's... Seen
    them often times before, but in more refined version. Of all ideas presented here,
    this one is the strongest but still one would ask himself whether to go this route
    since so many have gone down this one before with mixed results. Some logos look
    really great, others blunt...</li>\r\n<li>The last/new pack with magnifying glass
    is a missed one like the first pack. \"Rough\" looking magnifying glass clipart
    attached to type. It's also rather unreadable...</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nSome steps
    you should take:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Get away from the monitor. Take paper and pencil
    and draw and write ideas associated with your client needs and their business
    as well as logo goals.</li>\r\n<li>Start with a complete simple B/W logo without
    colours. This will help you keep detail down to minimum.</li>\r\n<li>When you
    feel you have some nice and strong idea on the paper, sit behind the computer
    and try to do it and see if it could work.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nSorry.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

    is it that Elmsmere Associates <em>do</em>?\r\nI suppose you chose the whole tree/leaf
    imagery because of the Elm in Elmsmere. If so and you want to stick with it, you
    might try combining the squared E with one or two leaves as an initial, renaissance
    style. Or maybe work the tree and its branches in.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/561px-Initial_fkr_17jhd-2_4121.png]"

    no linework and set Elmsmere in a sans. And track out your caps! Also, convince
    the client to just use \u201CElmsmere\u201D. There\u2019s a reason that the Target
    logo says \u201CTarget\u201D and not \u201CTarget Corporation\u201D."

    is a word with a meaning. Elmsmere is not. It all depends on the business they
    are doing. If it's some environmental company I'd remove associates, if it's some
    special services (lawyers/real estate etc) I'd keep associates...\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

    separate the word in two (like with the magnifying glass) use \"Elms\" not \"Elm\".
