  the right fonts to design a book about squatting. I'm looking for a good font for
  my body text & headers. I want my font to be correct in a iconographical way, and
  I have troubles searching for the right type because of the lack on background knowledge
  on typography. \r\n\r\nCan anyone give me a good suggestion on which font to use
  on a bookdesign about squatting?\r\n\r\nThx,\r\n\r\nN."

    about house-squatting? Or is this an exercise program? Or something else?\r\n\r\nMore
    details are really required to get an idea what the book is about. Assuming it's
    house-squatting... Is it a first person I-was-there adventure? Or is it a sociological
    book. Or is it from the property owners point of view, or maybe the cleanup or
    construction or security company's point of view? Are there a lot of statistics?
    Or pictures? Is it about a family? What? \r\n\r\nWho's going to be reading the
    book? Paperback, hard cover?"

  body: "It's a book about subcultures in society. I need to do research about house-squatting
    and transform it into a well-designed book. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking about a hard
    cover book (165x235mm); about a 100 pages (black & white only to keep it sober).
    Primarily the book shows a study about squatting, so it's an educational book,
    but not with a lot of statistics. I am going to explain house-squatting (why?
    what? who? where?) with a good text and some black & white photo's.\r\n\r\nI'm
    thinking about binding it with a jute textile around it and a black title silkscreened
    on the cover of it. "

    is beyond my limited font experience. A font which might be appropriate for house-squatting
    might not be elegant enough for your design.\r\n\r\nThe font I wanted to recommend
    at first is Skolar, a seriously seriffed, low contrast font, but this might lack
    the necessary elegance. Perhaps someone else can offer a direction for a solution."

  body: "Thx J. Tillman,\r\n\r\nSo maybe a hardcover book in jute would be to fancy?
    Because it primarily is a book that is made for an assignment at my graphic design
    studies the design and binding should be well done. But in order to compeed with
    the content of the book I need to change the binding and design? Skolar seemed
    like a good body text letter.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I was planning on binding the book,
    and let the hardcover open, combined with a sober, maybe recycled paper, black
    & white printed. [[http://www.nielsbenoot.be/book.JPG|photo]] This seemed like
    a good way to compare with content of the book, knowing that the design is there
    to support the content, not otherwise. \r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?\r\n\r\nThx"

    to be brief. First of all, book designers don't use the term \"headers.\" There
    is a reason for that. Secondly, a book interior is not generally considered a
    \"graphic design\" project. (Yes, I know there are a exceptions. Especially for
    those books whose role is to rest on a coffee table and not be read.) There is
    a reason for that, too. Maybe a first step would be to read a book or two about
    book design. If you just need familiarization, Rich Hendel's <cite>On Book Design</cite>
    could be helpful. If you need a how-to manual, you'll need a different book. (I
    don't know of any successful how-to design manuals.)\r\n\r\n"

    fonts. \r\n\r\nI\u2019d suggest a kind of <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-ygJ6aj/?refby=i\">\u201Cindustrial\u201D,
    idiosyncratic sans</a>, like Trade Gothic, Bureau Grot, Bau, Hermes, Venus, Folio,
    Rhode, Franklin or Benton Sans, Dagny, Titling Gothic, Scout etc.\r\nMost of them
    have wide as well as condensed styles which should give you enough possibilities
    for a varied layout, headlines and text, also on photos. (If it was about East
    Germany, Neuzeit, Super or a similar geometric sans-serif would fit too)\r\nGrey
    cardboard, black and white photos, recycling paper, maybe some red \u2026"

    though I would also argue against your opinion that a book\u2019s interior, especially
    a photo-heavy book like this one, isn\u2019t graphic design.\r\n\r\nAls je wilt,

    out the book suggestions.\r\n\r\n@Indra Kupferschmid, thanks for the font suggestions!
    \r\nI'm still doing research for my book and I'm still searching which regions
    are interesting to investigate. I was thinking about Germany, Belgium, France
    & Holland. I'm going to check out Bau, Bureau Grotesque & ITCFranklin Gothic.
    I'm not sure about Neuzeit for the entire book, but for the Germany chapter it
    wouldn't be bad. \r\nIf I'm using the grey cardboard I could silkscreen the cover
    with a nice black title. "

    embody the politics of squatting in your production design.\r\nFor instance, print
    your text in the white space of pages taken from coffee table books, palimpsest-style.\r\nThen
    the choice of font would be one that contrasts with the original typeface."
