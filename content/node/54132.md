  like to request your kind assistance!\r\n\r\nFirst, might I just tell you that I'm
  kinda old-fashioned... I love Baskerville, and I had a \"version\" specially made
  which has the Old Style Figures (one can of course get the OsF, but all the commercially
  available Baskerville fonts have the \"line\" figures); same thing with London,
  and with Garamond (I use a Mac, by the way, OS X 10.5, + MS Word 2008 because I'm
  a retired uni. professor, and it seems that's the software all publishers use, so
  I fear we don't have a choice).\r\n\r\nBut back to business\u2026\r\n\r\nAs I'm
  doing some research on the New Testament, I need to be able to type in Greek. \r\n\r\nFor
  the moment, I\u2019m using the Greek Unicode typeface that comes with Times New
  Roman.\r\n\r\nHowever, I must say I don't much care for the appearance of this font,
  or for any of the other Greek fonts I've been able to track down on the Internet.\r\n\r\nTo
  this posting I\u2019m attaching a page from a book: the font used is (I think) Plantin
  for English...\r\n\r\nBut could someone please advise me in what font/type style
  the Greek is printed?\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, it was commonly used in printed books
  from about 1880 till 1950, but before the era of computers, word-processing etc.\r\n\r\nI
  like this Greek type style very much, and would be more than grateful for any help
  (1) identifying it; (2) obtaining it, or even having it made to use on my computer?\r\n\r\nAll
  very best wishes from \u201Cdown under\u201D,\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew\r\n"

    for.\r\nBest wishes,\r\nThomas"

    ask, do you too use Greek in your word-processing? (I\u2019m just wondering how
    you were able to identify my font so easily...!). \r\n\r\nAgain, thank you sincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew"

    my research. I've always been fond of the typeface used in the Oxford Classical
    Texts series, which put me on the track of Porson.\r\nBest wishes,\r\nThomas"

    you could be very kind and help me out with one thing more...?\r\n\r\nWhen typing
    Greek Polytonic, using Porson, whenever I type a Greek acute accent (the semi-colon
    key), why does the text revert back to my default font Times New Roman?  (It means
    I have to keep highlighting all Greek text, then selecting GFS Porson, to make
    it consistent.)\r\n\r\nWhen you have a moment, any thoughts very gratefully received.\r\n\r\nKind
    regards,\r\n\r\nAndrew"

  body: "I assume you\u2019re using Word (I myself am using Nisus, where this problem
    does not appear). It seems that GFS Porson does not contain a separate acute accent,
    which is not actually needed when typing Greek. When you press the dead key for
    the acute accent (semi-colon), Word changes the font to one which contains an
    acute accent, namely Times New Roman, although we actually don't want a separate
    acute accent.\r\nThe only solution I could think of (there may be people here
    who know of a better solution) was to add an acute accent (and a diaeresis, which
    causes the same problem) to the font. I just sent a new version to you by email.
    I hope it works.\r\nBest wishes,\r\nThomas"
