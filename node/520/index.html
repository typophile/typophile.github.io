<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>fontsforflash.com and truthindesign.com are releasing something called "super pixel fonts". <br> <br>Is this "revolutinary" stuff? How are they built?</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>They seem to work by adding quarter and eighth "pixels" to create varying depths of gray when rasterized in Flash. It's basically custom anti-aliasing for bitmap fonts. Apparently optimized for Flash's rasterizer, they don't come out nearly as good in other apps.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm not sure why, technically. It could have something to do with the way FFF expands the outlines slighty to prevent filled-in counters in Flash. Here are some samples of FFF Business in Flash MX, Fireworks MX, and Photoshop 7. Also zoom views of the letter 'a' for each, and a snapshot of the vector outlines in Fontlab. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/12792.gif alt="FFF Business samples"></div>

<div class=commentbody>| It could have something to do with the way <br>| FFF expands the outlines slighty to prevent <br>| filled-in counters in Flash. <br> <br>It is due to expanded outlines. Flash renders characters on the left glyph margin, but Photoshop will include glyph spillover, if any. Most FFF fonts include these optimizations for the Flash renderer. However, they are not part of the Super Pixel technique. The newest Super Pixel font 'Halogen' is trimmed to the margin instead and does not blur in Photoshop or Flash. (it does lighten a little in Dynamic vs. Static mode in Flash, see image below) <br> <br>The second poster was right, the technique adds hand-antialiasing to pixel fonts without all that dangerous mucking about with hinting. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/12951.gif alt="Business & Halogen in Flash & Photoshop"></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, Garf, <br> <br>Antialiasing must be turned on, unless you're in Flash with a dynamic text field. In that case, the operating system itself draws the text. So I get the following results. Notice that at low quality, Halogen and Business lose their grey pixels, but Halogen retains them in the dynamic text field. In every example, dynamic is lighter than static, because it's being rendered by Windows 2000 with basic font smoothing (circa 95 plus pack). The black block is a difference filter between Medium and Best quality - no difference. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/13105.gif alt="Super Pixel Fonts in low quality, static and dynamic text"> <br> <br>Business and Halogen were built differently - Walter Apai of FFF designed Business after seeing my prototype super pixel fonts. Walter improved the use of the technique visually, and I improved the technical side. About a month after Business came out, I released Halogen, using a further refined technical approach. FFF has access to the full "Super Pixel Fonts"</div>

<div class=commentbody>Christopher, thanks for the elaboration. <br> <br>> When our patent is complete <br> <br>I'm no lawyer, but I think what's called "Prior Art" might prevent your patent from actually holding up in court. <br>In fact off-hand I can think of three cases of such "Prior Art" that might qualify, but I can't be sure. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Hrant, I know you're interested in hand antialiasing. I hope you will consider releasing a Super Pixel font through FFF. <br> <br>Prior art: that may be. I've found potential cases but none are in the Flash+TrueType+unhinted sandbox. <br> <br>There should be no difference between Business and Halogen output in MX vs. Flash 5 or 4. Has anyone tried 3 or 2 format? These also have antialiased rendering for embedded glyphs. <br> <br>-chris</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, I've been working on an "immersive on-screen reading" font called Mana on and off since '98... <br>I've even managed to "deliver" it through some funky CGI scripting: make each letter a tiny GIF and convert ASCII text to an image stream... :-/ But the raw HTML code size was prohibitive for long texts. <br> <br>Here's a snippet: <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/13119.gif alt=mana.gif> <br> <br>I actually contacted FFF, but they said the amount I expected for my design didn't make sense for their business. <br> <br>What about through you guys? <br> <br>I can always go solo, but having a high profile home would help Mana's sales a lot. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> > These also have antialiased rendering for embedded glyphs. <br> <br>> I don't get this part. <br>> hhp <br> <br>I meant to say, each version of Flash down to the original FutureSplash uses antialiasing. When a font is decomposed into geometry for display as static text, it will be antialiased. So, it's likely that very old versions of Flash will support Super Pixel Fonts. <br> <br>BTW, I like Mana. TiD's not yet set up to sell fonts though. Mana's grey fringing is far more refined than typical ClearType output. I would further lighten pointed forms like the crux of the y. <br> <br>p.s. what is a 'juvenile' or 'kiddie' letter y? <br> <br>-chris</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Miguel, Hrant, <br> <br>This is not a rude question and it comes up a lot. The generic name for greyscale pixel font methods is "sub-pixel fonts". <br> <br>"Super Pixel fonts" describes a patent pending technique which provides reliable rendering on all TrueType environments. Your grey dot fonts will probably be great (disclaimer, I love your fonts) but they won't be "Super Pixel fonts" unless you license with us and build them like we do. Hrant is right, it takes more than sub-pixels. <br> <br>In many countries, It is still legal to protect a method even if you are not a rich corporation. A patent holder is not obligated to extort and coerce, only to assert ownership. We hope to do this right. <br> <br>-chris</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like it. <br> <br>There were not a lot of 48 point bitmap fonts available for MacPaint so I made a few by doubling a 24 point font and smoothing it out in ResEdit in much the same way. <br> <br>A similar method was actually applied by the Apple LaserWriter when printing 72 dpi images (from MacPaint) - a mechanical, but competent, interpolation up to 300 dpi. I think some paint software was capable of the trick as well. <br> <br>I do not agree that his scheme's "errors and inaccuracies would likely be insignificant". No scheme is the equal of the eye, reader or typographer. But it's a big step up from nothing. the author of SmoothType should try it out as a rendering option. This would help old designs keep up with antialiased outline fonts. <br> <br>-chris</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have used Fontographer a lot since the old days of outline Mac fonts. It's great, but FontLab is better. Pixel fonts can be really tweaky to make (cutting counterforms, pixel snap, etc) and FontLab does a lot of it for you. I haven't tried the Mac version, apparently it's better.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Fog lets you create Outline and Bitmaps on 50% less price than Fontlab or Bitfonter. <br> <br>In my opinon,Flashfonter is NOT an application like Fontastic or Fog. Is a small app who lets you open fonts from your system and export a .VFB file on a pixel grid vector, thats it. The other is a pluging for fonlab, to draw those pixels as vector. <br> <br>I believe that pixelfonts deserve a $99 app like Typetool, no way to pay $500 to buy bitfonter or fontlab if you can do the same ob fog, you guys from Fontlab are on the time to build something like this. A Pixeltool 1.0 for $99 makes a sound for all who build pixelfonts. <br> <br>mh. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, I think by "PS" Darryl means Photoshop, not Postscript. (Darryl, most people on Typophile probably think "Postscript" when they see "PS.") <br> <br>Some people do the design work in Photoshop, then produce the font in FOG or FL. I've never used this method, so I don't know what's involved. I use BitFonter for the design stage and then import the resulting bitmap font into FOG where it can be traced.</div>

<div class=commentbody>AFAIK, nobody did. The idea of using an outline font to produce one font size is asinine. If not for pixel fonts, I would have been stringing together grayscale bitmaps like Hrant did with Mana. <br> <br>But they were there and I figured you could 'fraktur' them to get gray. Did I mention the level of gray is different in every rasterizer? And every user asks me if they can use it at 12 point as well as 8? Sorry, no - It's a hack! <br> <br>It's not a software patent. There's no software, just technique. (as we all know at this point)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Apologies to Rob who said "tech" not "software". Considering I said "technique", his last point stands pretty strong. <br> <br>But I disagree that it's not innovation. Six months ago you couldn't get sharp antialiased text in Flash, now you can, provided you can find the point size you want. <br> <br>I'm sure Macromedia will innovate me right out of the market by next year.

<div class=commentbody>Joseph is correct. We chose a partner with big marketing and credibility in pixel fonts. Flash designers feared grey smudging, so only FFF could offer something with grey pixels that could be trusted. TiD is known only in the Pocket PC and Flash arenas, so we are more or less invisible. <br> <br>PixieType's PixelFX appeared a month after Super Pixel Fonts. It looks like they're using our method. I can't speak to PixelFX' compatibility, different subpixel styles yield different results. <br> <br>We use a lot of tools, including some in-house tricks. FOG is great, FontLab's better at the moment.</div>

<div class=commentbody>An open question to the designers from pixietype.com... <br> <br>Why do you sell super pixel fonts without showing the name of your font designers? <br> <br>Do you have authorization from FFF or truth in Design for using this technique? <br> <br>Are you from Argentina? <br> <br>mh. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Nice one Darryl, <br> <br>FYI, if a designer doesn't want to figure it out and do it by hand, she/he can paint fonts in Photoshop and publish through TiD's new foundry. <br> <br>TiD has built a converter* that makes gray-pixel TTFs out of pixel images. Fonts from many typographers will debut next month, more are welcome. *it is not based on bitfonter.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>TiD's automatic converter introduces a degree of iteration in the design process without which any grayscale-pixelfont effort is effectively crippled. <br> <br>And Darryl, it seems that there is a small subset of grayscale-pixelfont methods that results in consistent and robust rendering across various apps (such as Photoshop versus Flash versus native-OS, etc.) as opposed to just working fine in one of them. Chris has done much legwork there. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey there
I have found a great superpixel font: [[http://pixelfonts.style-force.net/|Marke Eigenbau]]
imo the best pixelfont ever, it's very easy to read.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Those grays are way too light - they're almost invisible (and on
MacOS they're even lighter). Here's an example of leveraging gray
pixels for real: http://www.themicrofoundry.com/manademo/
BTW, Marke Eigenbau is shown as size 8, but it's actually a 9.
