body: "hi. i'm looking for a monospaced font similar to Pragmata but it should be
  more edgy.\r\nthe dots should better be rectangles and some curves should be more
  like 3 lines. a lot of 45\xBA angled lines would be great.\r\noh i nearly forgot:
  this desired look shouldn't decrease readability too much.\r\n\r\ndo you know such
  a font?\r\n\r\nthanks a lot already."
