body: "My understanding is that most fonts have the design space (UPM) of 1000 units
  and I'm curious if anyone knows why this is the standard?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask
  is because I'm beginning to feel the limitations of that space when working with
  small scale details, most notably when creating complex angles, intersecting shapes
  and especially when working with circular shapes (at a small scale or while merging
  or deleting from).\r\n\r\nOften times the point(s) of intersection when merging
  shapes or deleting from them do not land on a perfect grid coordinate, thereby distorting
  the end shape that I've created however slightly.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any thoughts
  or experience with this topic?\r\n\r\nIs there anyone that defaults to a (UPM) of
  2000 because of this issue and to work in fine detail?\r\n\r\nIt seems that a (UPM)
  of 2000 would be a more flexible space to work in, generally speaking.\r\n\r\nAny
  feedback is greatly appreciated."

  body: "While UPM 1000 is typical for PostScript fonts, 2048 is typical for Truetype.
    If you are outputting to OpenType of either flavor, you can use 2000 if you wish
    or 2048 as well. There was a thread on this in the past with some posts by Adam
    Twardoch explaining it in great detail. Try a search on UPM and see if they turn
    up?\r\nI have just had a problem with a font requiring higher resolution and bumped
    it up to 2000 with no problem so far. I hope to release the font soon so I will
    post any issues that I find in testing the higher UPM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    the beziers for type that needs to look \u201Cperfect\u201D at huge sizes?"

  body: "The advantage for larger UPM sizes is the control over curve and point placement
    as well as bezier handle placement. There is not a resolution change like you
    see with pixels. The grid made by the UPM controls where all points must fall
    so that any inbetween position is not possible. Most fonts won't need the difference
    but some can be helped--those which need more curve control.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
