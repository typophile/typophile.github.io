    font&#34; site. <BR> <BR>Do any one know if there is an &#34;lookalike&#34; free
    version of this font? <BR> <BR>BTW, if I have broken some forum rules with this

    border=0> Indeed you have broken some forum rules  <BR>with your last post, but
    that&#39;s no reason to delete it. As you  <BR>told us, you&#39;re a newbie so
    you couldn&#39;t know. I appreciate  <BR>you were so candid. I&#39;m pretty busy
    right now so I&#39;ll have  <BR>to get back to you later for some explanations.
    In the  <BR>meantime everybody go easy on Tormod, alright? First  <BR>one who
    doesn&#39;t behave gets booted! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Tormod, Yves will educate you but a good free site is DaFonts, you won&#39;t
    find the commercial fonts Zapfino or Papyrus, but maybe you will find something
    you could use.

  body: Hi Tormod, I didn&#39;t forget you. In short, we have nothing  <BR>against
    freeware or shareware fonts <i>unless</i> they are  <BR>pirated copies or rip-offs
    from existing commercial fonts. <BR>So we could point you towards websites which
    offer  <BR>legit free fonts &#40;unfortunately most of those sites are  <BR>severely
    tainted by the presence of rip-offs as well&#41;,  <BR>but we sure as hell won&#39;t
    tell you which free font is a  <BR>design stolen from Hermann Zapf.
