  to utilize the special characteristics of french, german and english (british) typographic
  design. It's not limited to certain typefaces but also grids and other elements
  indicating a nationality in design.\r\nSo i, currently being in research-mode, can't
  find all that much on certain direct markers that would identify a design as french
  or british.\r\nThere is quite much on german typography and considering that i am
  german i have a little knowledge regarding the german aspects.\r\n\r\nPractically
  im here to ask for your help on any books, authors or websites that could help me
  out.\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: Read the typesetting section of The Chicago Manual of Style, for a start.
    Also, visit the countries and just look at books, signage, magazines, newspapers,
    and take lots of photos. Graphic design has a distinctly different feel in France,
    Germany, and England (and, of course, compared to America); you can then try to
    identify why it feels different.

    be useful to look at older books from different countries to get a feel for practice
    before homogenizing influences had a chance to change the typography of some countries.
    (Although, in other cases, the limitations of metal type or the economic dominance
    of some countries might have suppressed national styles for some time.)\r\n\r\nOne
    example that comes to mind is that in Britain, it was normal practice to insert
    a space between a word and a colon which followed it.\r\n\r\nAlso, I remember
    reading a claim that Italian, instead of hyphenating, uses superscript letters
    somehow, although I don't recall ever seeing this in an Italian text."

    of capital letters so some German type designers such as the genius Georg Trump
    made their capitals shorter.
