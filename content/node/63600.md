  body: It is very clever from compositional and geometrical perspective, but conceptually
    it's a door that opens into the darkness. <em>That</em> has kind of an odd vibe
    to it.

  body: Minor crit. was that I wonder if the door handle will be legible at smaller
    sizes

  body: "I like it; If I were to see it by itself, I wouldn't be sure what industry
    it belongs to. I'm guessing since it is for you personally, it is for your design
    service? Otherwise, I relate the door to other types of business. Maybe the tag
    line could help tie it together.\r\n\r\nOverall the mark is strong. Perhaps moving
    the handle slightly away from the edge of the door would be better.\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback. It is a logo for me personally as a designer. I'm
    primarily a web designer, so I don't do traditional branding very often.\r\n\r\nI
    could see the \"door to darkness\" as being slightly eerie, maybe (like Kate suggested)
    a very clear and clever tag line could tie it all together.\r\n\r\nI want to say,
    \"broadening your horizons\" or \"taking you where you didn't think you could
    go\" in a much less cliche and/or grammatically sloppy way.\r\n\r\nThe door handle
    is a point of frustration for me, but it is definitely needed in order to communicate
    that it is a door. Maybe slightly larger and away from the edge would do the trick.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: 'To Paul: Maybe I don''t need a new logo. I''m more doing it so that I can
    improve my skills, and it seemed like a logical starting point. I''ve never had
    a personal mark that I felt comfortable with and proud of, so this was a way of
    doing that. But I see your point that many people want logos or icons when they
    really aren''t necessary.'
