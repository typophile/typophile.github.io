  body: Thanks. it&#39;s very close but not 100%. It&#39;s so close it looks like
    someone might have been a bit too inspired and made their own version. <BR> <BR>magnus

  body: Yea, I noticed that your sample may not be identical to &#39;Liant&#39;, but
    I thought that I should and would rather post the original source of &#39;Inspiration&#39;..

  body: There is a freeware typeface which is based on the same typeface  <BR>model
    FF Liant is based on. I really don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a rip-off or a  <BR>different
    digitization. Maybe it&#39;s that one. I&#39;ll see if I can find additional  <BR>information

  body: actually weleda hired ingrid liche to design a font which based on the philosopy
    of rudolf steiners anthroposophy.  <BR> <BR>those glyphs were carved in wood.
    the roots of this style came from the jugendstil/art nuveau in which steiner evolve
    his theory. in waldorfschools you can see many of those carved typfaces. <BR>
    <BR>nowadays weleda use a modified liant -version for all printing matters.

  body: Yeah, one of the first Svensk words I learned from my Svensk <BR>mother. Sadly,
    growing up in the US, I didn&#39;t learn many more. <BR> <BR>I think this was
    actually a high-end clothing shoppe.
