I&rsquo;m thinking also it could not have been a simple 2D distortion, more a 3D perspective (front point is top left of /J and back point is bottom right of /w, if you know what I mean). That could explain somehow the mismatch.</div>

<p>The peak of the &lsquo;w&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s left side connector would have to be custom. As well as the curl on the top of the &lsquo;r&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Should we consider this a heavily modified version of Bickham? It may have been traced over and tweaked.</p>

Curiosity now, why are you so insistent to find the exact matching font for what should logically be a logotype? J.Crew can easily afford any designer to create a unique woodmark (which sounds obvious for this industry) that could have been based on Bickham Script.
Now 2 more points for Bickham Script (easier with a bigger sample [[http://jcrew.tumblr.com/|here]]:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard enough for me to find script fonts I enjoy that looks contemporary and this was one that stood out to me. The version of Bickham I&rsquo;ve seen wasn&rsquo;t quite &ldquo;there&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing out the alternative glyphs. I still notice differences but no worries, we all look at things differently. For the sake of closure let&rsquo;s mark this as a modified version of Bickham Script.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone.</p>
