  body: The family I'm currently working on has 915 per font. No OS figures. At the
    moment there are 100 fonts in the family (no italics) I was hoping to get to 520,
    but I think I'll have to pace myself.

  body: "When I got the big Frutiger book, Typefaces, The Complete Works, I was surprised
    by the greater warmth of the original Univers, as I had always felt that Univers
    was a bit chilly in its look, lacking in charm for all its polish. Upon seeing
    the comparison of the original, warmer Deberny & Peignot version, I realized that
    the coldness was a product of redrawing for Linotype and other subtle changes
    over the years. \r\n\r\nNow I can see that Frutiger and his collaborators (Kobayashi?)
    seem to have restored the more attractive look of the original, at least from
    what I can tell on screen. At the Linotype site you can bring up both the old
    and new, and judge for yourself. \r\n\r\nSo aside from the new proliferation of
    weights and glyphs, I do think that the site's claim of restoring the \"humanism\"
    of Univers isn't just BS. I'm very glad that Frutiger has been able to restore
    Frutiger and Univers to the designs he wanted. \r\n\r\nThe differences are very
    subtle, but you can feel them--and feel them more than see them.    "
