body: "hello everyone,\r\n\r\ni was wondering if maybe someone could explain how en
  when to use the em and endash correctly. i remember reading somewhere that they
  both have different functions.\r\n\r\nfor example in a date do i use emdash or endash
  \" 17-05-09\"\r\n\r\nalso for example on a poster say an expo runs from 17 \"until\"
  20 march 2009 (meaning that actualy the expo ends on 19 march. do you use en or
  emdash between \"17 and 20\")\r\n\r\nhere in holland for dates they have \"tot\"
  and \"tot en met\" meaning \"till\" and \"till together with the date listed\" ...\r\n\r\ndon't
  know if i'm explaing it wright, hope you guys kind of understand what i mean here
  :D\r\n\r\nthnx so much in advance everyone \r\n\r\n"

    this case I would use neither, instead use a regular dash, or if you can, a figure
    dash.\r\n\r\n<em>also for example on a poster say an expo runs from 17 \u201Cuntil\u201D
    20 march 2009 (meaning that actualy the expo ends on 19 march. do you use en or
    emdash between \u201C17 and 20\u201D)</em>\r\n\r\nHere you would use an en dash.
    En dashes are used anytime you have something in a range (times, dates, etc.).\r\n\r\nAs
    far as em dashes go, you use them mostly in body text when interrupting a train
    of thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatrick"

  body: "'Trick, that's exactly how I use en dashes: from-to, but not within a phone
    number, ISBN/EAN, zip code, or date. I also use it in the sense of \"contrary

    Punctuation:\r\n\r\n<cite>...in the rare case in which a sentence is broken off

    in Bringhurst as \u2018a phrase marker\u2019 in a sentence with normal word spaces.
    I have seldom used an em dash except when I found the en dash too narrow.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    to indicate 17\u201320 March (meaning something runs from 17th until 20th March
    inclusive) I use an en with no spaces. For a date as numerals I would use 17/05/09
    although that might change if using non-aligning numerals as here.\r\n\r\nBringhurst
    also mentions the three-to-em dash (which I have never used), he also gives a
    pithy criticism of the em dash as belonging in \u201Cthe padded and corseted aesthetic
    of Victorian typography\u201D.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "When typsetting a book, or a text in a paragraph document, I prefer en dashes,
    in dialogues or in the middle of a sentence. Like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dashes01_3778.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    same text with em dahses looks weird. The em dashes are too wide (it also depends
    on the the typeface you're using), and deleting the blank spaces doesn't help:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dashes02_5863.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
    names and numerals/dates, I prefer using the hyphen, without blank spaces, instead
    of en dash; for the same reason: en dash in this case looks too wide:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dashes03_4612.jpg]"
