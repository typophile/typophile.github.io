  FONTS COLLECTION 8: \"ZEPHYRMEN\"\r\nHot on the heels of Collection 7 (\"Pagodaland\")
  comes another 15 Device families released under the code name \"Zephyrmen\". As
  we've come to expect from Rian it's an extremely varied and versatile collection
  of type, ranging from distressed (Roadkill, Zond Diktat) to playful (Catseye, Custard),
  historical (Mulgrave is based on cast-iron Victorian street signs) to futuristic
  (Gentry, Gridlocker). The 7 weight \"Ministry\" typeface is a notable revival, created
  after viewing the Ministry of Transport signage designs in the National Archives
  in Kew. All new releases are magnificently detailed in the new Device book \"Ten
  Year Itch\" (see below). \r\n\r\nView and buy the Device 8 Collection:\r\nhttp://www.fontworks2.type.co.uk/fw/doc?d=public/displaycase/device8\r\n\r\n-
  TEN YEAR ITCH: The definitive Device Fonts resource\r\nWorkaholic type designer
  and illustrator supreme, Rian Hughes celebrates ten years of font releases the only
  way he knows how, by sweating blood on a mammoth 160 page type specimen documenting
  the entire Device collection. Stuffed to the brim with samples, text settings, background
  info on each font and with a foreword by Erik Spiekermann this book is a visual
  feast for type fans. If you've admired Rian's work over the years the book will
  be indispensable. The softback version has fold out flaps featuring a cross section
  of logos designed for various clients and if you're really quick you may be able
  to purchase the extremely limited edition (only 150 exist) hardback volume with
  full colour dustjacket and a lime green embossed hard cover, signed and numbered
  by Rian. The book is officially unveiled in March but Fontworks have advance copies
  available to purchase now; e-mail sales@type.co.uk to place your order.\r\n\r\nView
