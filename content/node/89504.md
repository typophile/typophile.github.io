body: "Desgined some custom inlays for the front of this guitar that were to represent
  \"DD\" without actually being two Ds. The result is a little like a sine wave, a
  bow, infinity, part of a treble clef, or lots of other stuff you can dream up. It
  even looks like two Ds if you know that's what you're looking for:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_DDinlays_4483.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhen
  we were almost finished with the guitar, I was looking at my sketchbook from working
  the fingerboard inlays out and one design stood out that had the customer's initials
  of \"DDM\" all folded up and cryptic. I was really excited when the customer loved
  it and said we could inlay it on the back of the peghead:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_DDMmonogram_5536.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  wood is a dark Quilted Maple and the inlays are all in golden mother of pearl, all
  handcut. "
