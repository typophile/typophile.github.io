body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nBelow is an attempt at making a cursive greek in venetian
  style, to be used together with Jensonesque romans. It is mostly a period piece,
  so there will be a whole bunch of alternate characters and ligatures.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BucentoroGreek-45_6283.png]&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI
  would appreciate your critique and comments (especially if you can read Greek).\r\n\r\nSept
  20, 2006: version 0.21, first test of polytonic (no kerning yet).\r\nApril 14, 2007:
  version 0.56, connected polytonic with common ligatures."

  body: "Beautiful! Dense and expressive, but clear in the same way Jenson is. The
    low contrast, on a more vertical axis, is a very strong element. \r\n\r\nI'm sorry,
    I'm not a native, or even new reader of Greek. But I'm very interested as a type
    designer to be informed about other scripts. \r\n\r\nThis design seems a natural
    candidate for OpenType substitution wizardry. The ligatures, which I realize are
    historical, could be achieved in other ways, and the connections made even more
    true to the writing style the type is derived from. In other words, you could
    keep everything that's fluid and genuine about it, and even add more cursive connections
    wherever they are appropriate, with the benefits of OpenType. Sergei, would you
    be interested in some material on OpenType connecting scripts? I am not a salesman.

  body: Thanks, Carl, I am definitely interested. I know OpenType basics, but have
    no experience in making connected scripts. Bucentoro's ligatures are made by joining
    individual elements, so it is possible to assemble them with context substitution
    and proper positioning. The big question is how to approach this in a most effective
    way.

  body: "This is a fascinating project, and the tension between bounce, \"kappa\"
    height, slant angle and contrast is very nicely balanced. I'm impressed with the
    way many of the characters \"ligature\" together, especially double gamma.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I think that your roman is a little \"flat\" in comparison -- if you could \"bounce\"
    the baseline alignment of the roman (and Cyrillic...) a little, considering that
    the mean line (top of the x-height) already has some bounce, then I think you
    will have a better roman and greater harmony between the scripts. Bear in mind
    that we are used to seeing strict \"Jensons\" this past century, but during the
    Incunabula everything was a little wonky. Besides, we already have a lot of very
    proper Jensons, even some slightly weatherbeaten ones like Adobe Jenson, so perhaps
    the useful design space is beyond the end of the present spectrum -- inspired
    by your greek script, as it were.\r\n\r\nThe character forms of the basic setting
    are surprisingly orthodox (given the unusual quality of the ligatures), with the
    exception of the \"dropped\" lambda, which could be a sore thumb in a plain, contemporary
    setting of the face. I also feel that the eta is a bit stunted, for too obvious
    a reason. I like the fancy Omega; the Psi seems a bit tight, perhaps an alternate
    form with lower arms might be good.\r\n\r\nThe ligatures are a whole nother issue!
    -- the authenticity of which can be debated from many angles. Whatever, it will
    be a massive job to implement them in OpenType with full accents and breathing.
    I can see them finding commercial use, as well as scholarly.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of
    authenticity, I have always liked Jenson's M with the \"extra\" serifs.\r\n\r\nWill
    you be doing archaic cyrillic characters also? "

  body: "Thanks for the comments, Nick. This is a multi-year project covering latin,
    \ greek, and cyrillic and I am learning a lot about type design in the process.
    Roman part is in its first iteration and for now I use it mostly as color reference
    for the greek. Making a historical greek is very educational and I expect to gain
    some freedom to experiment with the roman later.\r\n\r\nGreek minuscules are based
    on certain mid-16th century manuscripts I like and a lot of features including
    low lambda, low theta, and short eta come from there, as do all the ligatures
    - everything comes from the same time and a very close circle of scribes. I plan
    to implement all meaningful ligatures with proper breathing and accents (I have
    about 300 in my collection). They will be available via the 'dlig' feature with
    \"legible\" ones sitting under the regular 'liga'.\r\n\r\nWhen this massive historical
    exercise is finished, I plan to make a separate simplified version for modern
    typography where familiarity is much more important than historical authenticity.
    And yes, archaic cyrillic is in the plans too.\r\n\r\nAs for Jenson, I am not
    a big fan of its uppercase, so I'll probably rework it into something more 'venetian',
    based on historical calligraphic models - something closer to the greek/latin
    small caps in this version. "

    I could from the available literature, then compiled a large corpus of classical
    texts and calculated the frequency data for sequences of 1-4 letters. The third,
    and probably the most important  source is manuscripts - my prototypes show a
    consistent set of ligature rules. Basically, the scribe picks one of the recognizeable
    letter shapes to continue the ongoing circular motion of the pen, with significant
    counterclockwise bias. I ended up implementing these rules via 'calt' mechanism,
    so there is no combinatorial explosion."
