That is the Typophile's beef with Mr Garfield, that he trivializes typography by focusing on those aspects of it which are most conducive to sensationalizing with his flashy wit.

If he were to write a book on another mainstay of civilization, cutlery (What The Fork?), one would no doubt discover the sexual peccadilloes of the inventor of  the pickle fork, be treated to a rehash of the Macdonalds coke spoon incident, and the story of how Ginsu revolutionized TV advertising.</div>

They are those which have missing glyphs, wrongly encoded characters, inconsistent character widths, unkerned accented characters, or which don't show up in the font menu.

"Brush Script was made available by American Type Founders (ATF) in 1942, and its designer Robert E Smith gave it a lower case with joining loops, creating a quaint and consistent type that looked as if it was written by a fluid, carefree human. The problem was, no one you had ever met actually wrote like that"

And why not? I'm sure you want to hemorrage when you see bad design. Yet, designers still want to protect this "insider status" they had previous to desktop publishing. I kind of see typographers circling their wagons instead of confronting the problem. While every ignorant lay person thinks that if they know the alphabet they know typography. I believe this is short-sighted. Unless we expose the "normal" population to an understanding of typography beyond Comic Sans and Papyrus we are just going to have more of the same. Have you seen how popular LetterMpress is on the Mac App store. I believe people do care about type they just don't have many places to look...unless textbooks and reference guides are your thing. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">In terms of serving an introduction to typography Garfield did a good job.

What is wrong with writing a book to give some depth to a topic in which most don't even realize exist? Every typography book I have ever opened starts with kerning and readability, typically an instant turn-off. Think about the first time all of you have come across that "aha" moment when you actually realized letters and words are packed with various functionality and personalities. Did this moment come when you had a personal experience with type, or were you force fed principles of typography by someone who knew more than you? 98% of the people I know “breath helvetica” not only ignorant to its rich history but in addition there are thousands of other faces that have crazy and interesting backgrounds. This allows the average reader to create a connection with a typeface and then hopefully realizing there is much to be learned about the topic as a whole.

The book is a open door that invites people to learn more about a topic they didn't even know existed. 

Coffee Table Book? Sure. Successful in its intent? Yes. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Is there any difference between this book tainting the landscape and the typographer who sends his "type babies" out into the world with no say as to how they could be used.

Maybe the discomfort of this book is a displaced outcry from all the typographers who have quietly groaned in the background when their own "type babies" were used in vain.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Do agree with some of Garfield's least favorites - could never stand Souvenir, for instance, or Avant Guard or Rotis (with which The Economist had a brief flirtation). 

The small type in the original, great little Penguin historical atlases by Colin McEvedy was economical, attractive and read legibly and fluently in Times. Times was replaced by the higher x-height Rotis in new editions of some of the books. Trying to be contemporary, I suppose, they made the books look and read ugly: with Rotis, the sense is chopped up - it's harder to take in whole phrases and thought units at one time.
