  school, but I'm far from a typophile. I was hoping someone here would quickly be
  able to tell me what font the website someecards is using for their greeting cards,
  since it would probably take me a year of browsing typefaces to figure it out.  I
  checked it against some of the fonts I know are trendy (i.e. helvetica) but, nothing.

  body: 'Jan - very swift, thank you. I see that''s the same typeface the BBC uses.  I
    also see its status is still only commercially available, albeit fairly cheaply
    in comparison to another I was looking at (i.e. Lisboa Sans @ $300).  How does
    that work, anyway.  I would have figured that after nearly 80 years a typeface
    family would be noncommercial.   '

    that it had to be digitized and what you have to pay for is the license to use
    it as software (fonts are software)."
