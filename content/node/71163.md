body: "I am having some issues with font activation and was wondering if anyone had
  any ideas as to what might be happening.\r\n\r\nI imported a font family into my
  library using Font Explorer X Pro and activated it. It says that it is activated.
  But, when I go to select it in InDesign, or any other application for that matter,
  the family is nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any clue as to what might
  be going on? I don't know what to do as the font manager says the family is activated,
  but it doesn't actually appear anywhere else.\r\n\r\n<cite>EDIT: System restart
  solved the problem.</cite>"
