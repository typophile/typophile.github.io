body: I am trying to collect a small list of ways to say welcome in various languages
  for a new project. There are several websites that have fairly deep lists but many
  of them conflict with each other, understandably since there are numerous greetings.
  <BR> <BR>I know several people here have rather diverse language experience so maybe
  you could help make sure that I am as accurate as possible with some of these. Please
  let me know if any words here jump out as being inaccurate or maybe not the best
  way to say a simple, informal welcome. Also, any suggestions for other languages
  are welcome too. Welcome, ha... <BR> <BR>bienvenue -French <BR>benvenuto -Spanish
  <BR>bienvenido -Italian <BR>bem-vindo - Portuguese <BR>bine al venit - Romanian
  <BR>hosgeldiniz &#40;s cedilla&#41;- Turkish <BR>ia ora na - Tahitian <BR>tervetuloa
  - Finnish <BR>&uuml;dv

  body: portuguese&#42; and german are right. <BR> <BR>&#42; if you were saying welcome
    to a woman, you would say <i>bem-vinda</i> instead.
