  something type related to keep me occupied while my better half visits Bergheim
  and Brandenburger tor. And as usual every little tip is of great value -- bookstores
  to burial grounds etc.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "All the cemeteries in Berlin are a treat. There are several along the base
    of Prenzlauer Berg, just outside of Mitte (a short walk from Alexanderplatz).
    Kreuzberg has a massive multi-cemetery complex from behind the Bergmanstra\xDFe
    onwards.\r\n\r\nThe design bookstore fave seems to be B\xFCcherbogen on Savignyplatz.\r\n\r\nI
    quite like the museums, but I wouldn't say that they are quite typographic. Although
    current branding and ads for the Bode Museum and the Pergamon Museum are.\r\n\r\nThere
    are a number of monuments with inscriptional lettering to see, including the memorial
    to Soviet troops in Treptower Park as well as a memorial to WWII Polish partisans
    in the Friedrichshain Volkspark.\r\n"

    stop). It is \"the mother of all airports\"*, sadly slated to close at the end
    of October. I don't know about any type, but just the photos of its monumentalism
    give me the shivers (in the best way). I might make a trip to Germany just to
    fly into it, into its glorious canopy. Sigh.\r\n\r\n* Norman Foster\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
