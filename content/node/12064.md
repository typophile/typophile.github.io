  you can see I'm trying to go for something with a few \"quirks\" or strange features
  so it won't be just another bland sans. The \"n\" was originally drawn by hand,
  then after many many months converted to curve and tweaked. As for the rest, it
  was done directly on-screen in a desperate attempt to try and pass the feel of the
  n to other letters.\r\n\r\nThis is my first-ever, [supposedly] serious attempt at
  designing type. Serious as in \"I'd like to finish it\", not serious as in \"I'd
  like to sell it\". \r\n\r\nWell, enough rambling. Please, opinions, praise, criticism,
  anything!"

  body: "nice start. the o's look a touch heavier than the n and H. also, why is the
    right foot of the n rounded, but not the H?\r\n\r\nwould help to see more characters.
    maybe you can add the related characters: mhucebdpq. also shouldn't be too hard
    to throw in an i or an l. that way we can see how the flavor carries over to the
    other glyphs. It will be interesting to see how the quirks, as you put it, will
    carry over to different letters, and how the face ends up working as a whole.
    One thing I've discovered as a beginning type designer is that subtle elements
    end up making a big difference. On one letter, the quirk may seem subtle, but
    when the entire alphabet reflects the quirks, it can be overwhelming.\r\n\r\nlook
    forward to seeing more\r\n\r\neric"

  body: "Eric, thank you very much for you input.\r\n\r\n<em>also, why is the right
    foot of the n rounded, but not the H?</em>\r\n\r\nI actually haven't tried that,
    because i always thought that it would make the strong \"foundation\" of the H
    seem weak, as if had a bad leg and would fall to the right. As I created the n,
    I thought that I would have to be very careful on carrying that rounded foot to
    other characters, or the alphabet could end up *too* unusual. I don't want something
    that looks too strange for more than a line of text.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for
    commenting! I'll post some more characters next week, I think."

  body: "nice work, gabriel I like where it's going. I like how the inconsistency
    in the curves and stokes give the letters life, kind of like natural inconsistencies
    from letterpress printing as opposed to the perfection of digital type. \r\n\r\nA
    few comments:\r\n\r\nthe u looks wide compared to the n. the d also looks a little
    wide as compared to the b. It looks like the d is an invertd p, but that the b
    was constructed differently. maybe I'm just seeing things.\r\n\r\nI like the little
    flares in the j, perhaps this can be incorporated into the i as well?\r\n\r\nkeep

    the others, then use the b as the basis for the others

      they could be better. This is all a learning experience for me, so I want to
      do them with care. \r\nBut I'll think of them (the previous pqd) when doing
      the new ones. :)"

    got some of the geometry, but the imperfections really liven things up. I like

    post a pdf so we can see something at higher resolution?\r\n\r\nnote on the f:
