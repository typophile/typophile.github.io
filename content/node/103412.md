body: "Perhaps not the right terminology but I am looking for fonts that have a big
  'swashes' associated with them. I new to create something similar in the attached
  image, whereby the last letter, y in my case and d in the example attached forms
  a swash. \r\n\r\nDo such fonts exist or is this something I would manually create.
  Appreciate any help."

  body: Those tails and swashes can be found in some fonts. Have a look to some of
    them tagged "[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/baseball|baseball]]" at MF may lead
    you in the right direction.
