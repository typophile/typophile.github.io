  ago. It is from a Star Wars comic \"Jedi Quest\" published by the editorial Dark
  Horse Comics in 2001, although they have also used the same font in many other series.
  I have looked and looked at hundreds of sources, but I do not find any similar.
  I would be very very grateful for your help. \r\n\r\nhttp://img278.imageshack.us/img278/4827/starwarsjediquest02243fz.jpg"

    Blambot and Comicraft.

  body: I had read that Dark Horse had used fonts from those two webs in their comics,
    but I have been searching there but I haven't been able to find that specific
    font :-(
