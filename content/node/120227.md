    That may be a tricky one. For instance, that shape for <em>\u0434</em> can be
    found in the Serbian localization of Brill italic.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/main_building_3769.png\">"

  body: "I agree. The lettering looks like a Frankenfont that mixes all sorts of things.
    \u03D0 and the other substitutions you suggest are indeed plausible. Perhaps in
    contemporary Russia hybrid lettering is chic for the web cognoscenti.  Unless
    there is a lot of other lettering from the game with this style I am tempted to
    think this is a one off phrase. sort of a cultural compost.\r\nAnyway, on further
    reflection, I believe finding something by an extended string search seems like
    a long shot.\r\nDon"

  body: "Finding an upright font that matches may not be easy. The problem is that
    those sites may cheat a lot with alphabets. They may well put a u instead of an
    \u0438, and a \u0261 from IPA extensions for a \u0434 etc. There is no way to
    know what the actual string used to produce the picture was. To my eye, the \u0432
    looks a lot like a \u03D0 (greek beta symbol)."

  body: "Here is a very informative quote from Nick Shinn on March 8, 2008\r\n\r\n---
    start quote ---\r\nBulgaria?\r\nA poster to Typophile described a \"cartel\" situation
    there--with only one design school teaching typography, and a small community
    of typographers. Several type designers have gotten together in the HermesSoft
    foundry, and are promoting alphabet reform with their fonts. (The reform is to
    use italic or script letter forms in the Roman alphabet, which produces a latinized
    look, with more ascenders and descenders than usual in Cyrillic.)\r\nHow much
    support does this have within the country's education system? If Bulgarian cyrillics
    are being taught in elementary schools, that would critical.\r\nThere is also
    the fact that Bulgaria is the only Cyrillic-using country in the EU, so Bulgarian
    cyrillics could become a de facto norm in the EU.\r\n\r\nThat's all I know about
    the situation, but it was enough to persuade me to include a set of Bulgarian
    alternates in my Cyrillic fonts (along with five or six Serbian alternates). These
    glyphs are language-tagged, so are the default when the fonts are used (a) with
    Bulgarian language and (b) software that supports language tagging in OT fonts
    (that would be CS3--I don't know about MS).\r\n--- end quote ---\r\n\r\nThe quote
    is excerpted from a long multipage discussion of The future of Cyrillics. http://typophile.com/node/42363\r\n\r\nThe
    main point relevant to identifying the letters in question is that they may be
    from a font produced by HermesSoft. https://www.hermessoft.com/\r\nSomewhat similar

    what kind of querry they can make, but if you can find an upright font with a
    letter \u043D that has serifs on both sides at the bottom but just on the left
    at the top, a \u0437 with a  serif at the top and none at the left bottom, and
    a \u0434 that looks  like a <em>g</em> with a tail that ends pointing to the right,
    maybe you will end up with a small set to choose from."
