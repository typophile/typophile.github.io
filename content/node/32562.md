  corporate style guide denotes Eras as their main typeface. So I load up our copy
  of ITC Eras only to notice that the style guide's version does not have that slight
  slant Eras is known for.\r\n\r\nDoes a 'non-slanted' version of Eras exist? I've
  looked around on myfonts and linotype with no luck. Could it be that I'm being tricked
  by a sneaky modified version that only exists on a CD at the bottom of my client's
  desk?\r\n\r\nAny help would be laaarvely.\r\n\r\nAndrew."

    be doable, but maybe not alltogether legal\u2026"

  body: The Eras released by Adobe in the late eighties included two versions--the
    normal, slightly slanted version and an upright version. The upright version was
    intended for low-res (300 dpi) laser printers that would have noticeable jaggies
    on the slight angles otherwise. I don't know if the non-slanted version is still
    available, but that may be what they are using.

    USING ITC ERAS ON PostScript TYPESETTERS:\r\n\r\n\t\tFor best results on PostScript\xAE
    Typesetters, ITC Eras\xAE should be used at resolutions of 1270 lines per inch
    or greater.  At this resolution the highly readable face shows the distinctive,
    slightly cursive letterforms designed by Albert Boton and Albert Hollenstein.
    \ At resolutions below 600 lines per inch, the printer uses a slightly modified
    version of the design in which the characters appear upright, but maintain the
    distinctive features of a large x-height, broad curves, open counters, and sharp
    angles.\r\n\r\nAdobe and PostScript are registered trademarks of Adobe Systems

    side note: in my Nour&Patria system I have a slight slant but it's\r\njust small
    enough that upto 16PPEM it won't render any jaggies.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
