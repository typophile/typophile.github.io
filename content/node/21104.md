  body: easily? I don't think that exists in XP land. Seriously though, I would be
    interested in an answer as well. Whenever I try to use the character map on an
    Opentype face that I also have on my Mac, a lot of the glyphs don't show up.

  body: "FWIW: Have just downloaded and tried that utility; seems to work as described
    on Adobe fonts. Mixed results on others, but that's acknowledged by the creator.
    Gives you access to small caps, OS figures, ligatures and related features if
    they were included in the font. Doesn't get at alternate glyphs. Because of the
    structured way it creates the name for the font containing the accessed characters,
    Word users could presumably then code a macro to swap out characters from one
    font to the other according to their own preferences. (Like, swap numerals to
    OSF except within a table, swap to small caps where a particular style's used
    - or where faux small cap formatting is applied! etc.)\r\n\r\n__________________________________________\r\nEver

    Lyx/Latex and until it gets native support I will continue to use postscript.)

  body: "Adobe's existing OpenType fonts ALL encode every single glyph in the font,
    with the small caps, oldstyle figures, etcetera at standardized Unicode positions
    (around U+F6xx-F7xx).\r\n\r\nSo there's no need to hack apart the font with special
    tools. You can access all those glyphs now.\r\n\r\nMind you, Adobe is also abandoning
    this approach in new fonts moving forwards: glyphs without legitimate Unicodes,
    that are alternates or ligatures of standard characters, will be left unencoded
    (accessible by OpenType layout features).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Preferred answer:\r\nUse only applications that support OpenType Layout features.\r\n\r\nAlternative
    answer:\r\nWord uses the Unicode codepoints. Any character with a Unicode codepoint
    can be entered into Word -- through standard system mechanisms such as an appropriate
    keyboard layout, the Character Map application (through the clipboard), and also
    by methods specific to Word, e.g. typing the four-letter hexadecimal code and
    pressing Alt+X, or through a VB macro.\r\n[[Adam Twardoch]], in <a href=\"http://groups.msn.com/FontLab/general.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=5986\">FontLab

    using PUA codepoints, so the use of the method above is highly discouraged (even
    with fonts that contain PUAs nowadays)."
