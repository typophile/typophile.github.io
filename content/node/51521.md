    I stink at Type ID). Thanks Joe, for revising the rules.\r\n\r\nWhat I said should
    be taken with a grain of salt. As it says in the initial post - \"Smack talk is
    encouraged.\" I am just here to give you a hard time. If you haven't noticed,
    I don't often participate myself because I can't draw type very well - therefore
    one could argue that I shouldn't say anything :)\r\n\r\n<cite>- going by the rules,
    nobody has created an entire alphabet (a-z) solely for this, have they? Does the

    created entire alphabets, and entire typeface families based on their own battle

    that this is the most legible ultra-gordo i've ever seen.  I think an interesting
    exercise in type design is to do a crazy heavy like that, and then try to get
    the same character in a light version. Bonus points for direct interpolability.
    Sounds like next week's battle!\r\n\r\nStephen/BJ, thank you for your kind words.
    Now I need a cracking whip. Looks like some OT calt will be needed for smart high/low
    joins. Should be interesting: o-r would be a strange combination.\r\n\r\nRuben,
    I like your Pressig-style clipped one. That is the technique I use to rough out
    characters or lettering. The danger is that sometimes I fall in love with the
    clipped-ness and cant find the same charm in a smooth version!"

  body: "Chris, I'll have to draw a few more letters before I can really decide!\r\n\r\nI
    started out drawing a pretty boring Bodoni look-alike (see earlier sketch), but
    decided to turn it into an upright cursive with swashes to make it interesting.
    If I were to create a usable alphabet out of this though, I realize I would have
    to provide alts.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether the swash glyphs or the tamer versions
    will be the default form. I'll probably have to design hundreds of ligatures if
    I want to keep all the swashes, as they are going to cause a lot of clashes. Or
    maybe context-specific swashes. I'm inclined to try to keep all the swashes and
    see how that works out.\r\n\r\nBut I'm certainly not going to whip up an entire
    lowercase alphabet in a day like you did! I'm still amazed how fast you work.
    You and Randy, also Christian Robertson from previous battles..."

    I tried to post them on the next morning, for some strange reasons my \"insert

    later posted my designs under the title of \"embarrassment\" the next day- can
    the moderator please remove that post? thanks.\r\n\r\nOxford defines \"defiant\"
