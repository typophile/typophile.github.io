body: "Hey guys, I'm currently working on a project in which we need a calligrapher
  to write us a small text. The text is to written in a style somewhow similar to
  this one: http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=PTT0000041#specimen\r\n\r\nIf
  you live or work in Barcelona and you are interested on this project, please contact
  me via Typophile or for this e-mail: nuno AT estudipuk DOT com\r\n\r\nUPDATE-----------------------------\r\n\r\nOk,
  change of plans, the number of invitations just raised to the point that it\u2019s
  not possible to wright everyone\u2019s name on the invitation so basically now anyone
  can help even if you\u2019re in china.\r\n\r\nSo Here is the Brief:\r\n\r\n- We
  need a nice text for something close to 500 characters for an invitation.\r\n- The
  style of the text we need is similar to:\r\nthis one: http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=PTT0000041#specimen\r\nor
  this one: http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000104\r\n\r\nBasically
  we\u2019re searching for the type of style of a writer from the XIX century, something
  that isn\u2019t totally perfect, that is warm and human.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make
  it an effective selection process, what I\u2019ll need will be:\r\n\r\n- How much
  will you charge for this work\r\n- 2 samples of a phrase. One with the style we
  are looking for, and other in case you have a style that fit\u2019s this project
  and you feel more comfortable about.\r\n\r\nthe sample phrase is: \u201CJackdaws
  love my big sphinx of quartz.\u201D\r\n\r\nSend it to: nuno AT estudipuk DOT com\r\n\r\nthanks
  alot :)"

    this is a handy resource for finding calligraphers. \r\n\r\nI think you might
    want to ask them to try and replicate a sample first as a lot of calligraphers
    tend to just do standard calligraphic hands since their main work source is usually
    invitations, envelope addressing, etc. I've had to replicate that style a bit
    now and then for greeting cards, but I have to retain a higher degree of  legibility.
    But, unfortunately, I am quite far from Barcelona.\r\n\r\nStephen"
