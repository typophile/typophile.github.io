    &#40;I am told&#41; advocates for ben-gay! <BR> <BR>A group of people in Denmark
    has decided to find out, even if it means emailing the old man himself. We&#39;ll
    keep you informed. <BR> <BR>In the meantime: <BR>- how do you pronounce Goudy?
    <BR>- how do you pronounce Hrant? <BR>- are you planning to show up i Copenhagen
    in September?'

    <BR> <BR>I think Goudy is &#34;gawdi&#34;, but stess the first syllable, not the
    second, otherwise you&#39;d be talking about my all-time favorite architect. &#34;Hrant&#34;
    is just like it&#39;s spelled, stressing the &#34;a&#34; &#40;not the invisible
    &#34;uh&#34; between &#34;h&#34; and &#34;r&#34;&#41;. The &#34;a&#34; is flat,
    like in &#34;ah&#34;. <BR> <BR>Copenhagen isn&#39;t looking good for me right
    now... :-&#40;  But I&#39;m going to try very hard for Rome 2002. &#40;No, it&#39;s
    not the Olympics, but that&#39;s not stopping me from training for the typolevault.
    ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>I guess you&#39;re going to the Copenhagen one? Grrr... <BR>
