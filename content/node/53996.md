body: Signs in New Orleans are different from signs throughout the U.S. because they
  are more unique.  When I am driving through the city local stores and images on
  buildings always catch my eye.  Many signs down here are hand drawn and are very
  much like graffiti others are different in the sense that they really experiment
  with type and different ways of showing words. I chose these four pictures to exemplify
  the different types of signs you may see in this city.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0530_3433.jpg]
