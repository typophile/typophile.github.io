    Margaret Re <BR> <BR>Yeah, a chance to brag! I was the research assistant for
    Ms. Re on this project. This is the accompanying book and type catalog for an
    exhibit that is currently touring. I got to meet Matthew Carter at the exhibit
    opening. A very cool experience.'

  body: I just checked the link for the personal website. That&#39;s a different Matthew
    Carter. Not the type designer.
