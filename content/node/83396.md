body: Can somebody identify the font used to make this sign? The letters d and e are
  damaged, the damage that is NOT part of the actual design. Thanks for your help![img:sites/default/files/old-images/LM

  body: "I don't know what's going on, but I don't think that 'e' belongs. My guess
    is that these are not taken from a specific font, because all bets are off when
    letters are being manufactured. When I use this 'M' and 'a' I get only 24 fonts
    as candidates in the Serif Font ID Guide, and none of them seem like good matches.\r\n\r\n-
