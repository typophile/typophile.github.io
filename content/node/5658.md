body: I ran across this website earlier today. It is as BLING BLING as it gets...
  Anyways, the site incorporates 1 maybe 2 fonts for the logos. I am trying to figure
  out what script font was used. <BR>Any Ideas... Anyone? <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.daddyyankee.com"

  body: Took a quick look through Letterhead Fonts, but didn&#39;t see anything quite
    like it.  It doesn&#39;t look like anything I have already collected for the Script
    Font ID Guide, so I&#39;m inclined to guess it&#39;s a custom design. It does
    appear to be a font, and not hand drawn, I think, unless whoever lettered it is
    very consistent and steady.

  body: Hey, Valentine, welcome to Typophile! <BR> <BR>Just a suggestion, when posting
    on the type ID forums, it helps if you give the thread a more descriptive name.
    A title like &#34;What font is this?&#34; makes it difficult to remember when
    you are browsing trough several threads... <BR> <BR>good luck with this one!

  body: Thanks for the advice Jesus. Thanks for looking too Mike. Upon looking at
    the credits on the website, it appears that Mark Allen did the Calligraphy. He&#39;s
    released one font back in 1994.. the name of that murdered ceasar in &#34;The
    Gladiator&#34;. But nothing else. It appears my chances of getting text that looks
    just like this is nill. I suppose Bickham Script is still my favorite <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
