body: "Really basic question:\r\n\r\nThough I have spent some time drawing glyphs
  (two or so years) I have never acquired much experience exporting complete fonts.
  A client wants me to add some characters to a font but when I open the font in FontLab,
  add the characters and try to export the font I lose all the existing metrics. I
  know this is probably a basic oversight on my part but I'm a little short of time
  so if somebody could point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your time in advance."

  body: If you're opening a Postscript Type 1 font, then the kerning information (which
    is what I assume you mean by "metrics" -- although metrics technically covers
    more than just kerning) is stored separately and must be imported from either
    the suitcase file or the corresponding AFM file.

    version like 5.0.2 or 5.0.3. There was the bug fixed in 5.0.4.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohnych"

  body: Thanks for the pointers, I think it is more likely that I am overlooking a
    whole aspect rather than a bug. Will post again when I have had time to try some
    things out. Thanks again.
