  I put up on our hobby music myspace page.  Surprisedly, it's the most straightforward
  idea I came up with, containing none of the nice little twists I now buried with
  the other sketches.\r\n\r\nTaking it from here ... can anyone suggest a good font
  type for the name?\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge is that it should match the music
  (here's the [[http://www.myspace.com/antillmusic|myspace page]]). The current font
  is a modified Blackoak but it reminds me more of a retroish rock band with country
  elements.  Something a little more modern which translates the individual character
  would be nice.  In the music club beats are layered with processed samples of the
  instruments plus my lazy vocals ;)\r\n\r\nAlso, the type should look good in a complex,
  detailed variant (see 1) which we could use on a t-shirt, a reduced variant (see
  2) for use on the website and finally a very reduced variant (see 3) for small flexprinting
  on a cap.  Even in scenario 3 it should be legible.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?
  \ General logo suggestions are welcome, too, since I'm still working on the sketch.
  \ Once everything's looking ok I'll concentrate on color, kerning etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/all_6586.jpg]"

    might be helpful for other "amateur designers" ;)

  body: Sigh, can anyone please help out with a font type suggestion?  What is wrong,
    too much text?

- body: "I think most of us were immediately frightened off by the fact that you were
    taking advice from a myspace poll. Also, typophile was 404 for quite a while earlier
    this week.\r\n\r\nI'll give you my impression of what you've got so far. \r\n\r\nOverall,
    it's way too detailed, and the mix of photographic elements with (what looks like)
    pencil lines doesn't achieve rugged or grunge - it just looks sloppy. The third
    version is headed in the right direction, but it's far from complete. \r\n\r\nI
    think (?) your spikes are meant to be a platform, but the way it looks now, it's
    really more of a violent-looking star. I'd scrap the four \"spikes\" on the bottom
    and replace them with a mirror image of the top three spikes (which, btw, I would
    redraw to center the middle spike, and/or exaggerate the angles for drama.) \r\n\r\nRepeat
    after me; simple is GOOD. Simple is memorable, and simple will save you money.
    I suggest spending some time looking at vector art (icons and logos) and find
    some microphone art you like to inspire your rendering. (but stay away from gradients
    - $$$) Of your three versions, none will scale down AND up and still look like
    a microphone. The last one is looking ... well, naughty.\r\n\r\nIn short, I think
    the silence on this thread is collectively saying; \"The font is the least of
    your worries.\" Sorry if this seemed harsh, but it's honest. I hope it helps.\r\n\r\nAK"

  body: "Hi Alaskan,\r\n\r\nok, 'Simple is Good'.  Thank you for your critique and
    suggestions.\r\n\r\nSimplifying the starlike structure at the bottom and seeking
    inspiration in vector based art for the complex grille will be my next go.\r\n\r\nThe
    grille appears to be the most incompatible portion in regard to flexprint.  This
    should - at least - solve the technical shortcomings ;)\r\n\r\nRegarding aesthetics,
    I like the violent appearance of 'the star'.  People who record in studios will
    identify it as a classic microphone shock mount.  Others will take it as a star.
    Exaggerating this structure is a good suggestion.  Also, I don't mind the phallic
    qualities of the design, it's not for streamlined corporate purposes so that's
    ok.\r\n\r\nToo bad, I would have loved to integrate a font I'm confident with
    but I guess I'll have to take care of that in step two.\r\n\r\nNo worries about
    the 'harshness' of your feedback.  I've posted here to learn, not for pats on
    my back. It was a lot milder than I expected and inspirational."

    style <a href=\"http://sudtipos.com/home\" target=\"_blank\">Sudtipos</a> specializes
    in. Something nice and fat like Calgary Script or Milk Script. Then I would draw
    an illustration to match the type.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
