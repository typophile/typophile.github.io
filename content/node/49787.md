  I include X in my fonts or should I leave that one out?\r\n\r\nI think, I think
  so."

  body: "Like I said in [[http://typophile.com/node/49788|this other post]], about
    15 years ago, I created for myself a phonetic alphabet in which all unnecessary
    or redundant characters were either omitted or re-assigned new sounds. I used
    the x to precede long vowels and did away with the silent e and all other letter
    formulas we use in the English language to indicate long vowel sounds. And I created
    a brand new letter to indicate the long bowel sound.\r\n\r\nThe alphabet was first
    called Planetease, and then I changed it to Earthish. I even matched it up to
    <cite>Twinkle Twinkle</cite> (that's <cite>Sparkling Stella</cite> for the music
    snobs), like the real alphabet song. I showed it to my mom and she could actually
    read it without instruction. I thought I was a genius for a little while and it
    was a neat way to journal but then I quit using it.\r\n\r\n"
