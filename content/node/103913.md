  body: "This is an edited version of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fette_Fraktur\">Fette
    Fraktur</a>, i.e.  a \"heavy\" weight version of the Fraktur style of blackletter
    typefaces. A German punchcutter,  Johann Christian Bauer, designed it in 1850.
    Digital versions are available from various foundries. Your image differs from
    the usual version of Fette Fraktur \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FetteFrakturInUse1_4733.jpg]\r\nmainly
    in the substitution of a Latinized S, clipping the tails on I and Y, clipping
    the back-flip on O, and rounding the comb-over effect on the bowl of R. \r\nI
    would be interested to learn if anyone knows whether this edit has been released
    as a font.\r\nDon"
