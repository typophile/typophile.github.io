body: 'Why is Linotype claiming ownership of Eurostile and filing trademark applications
  when it is in the public domain? <BR> <BR>Following are Adobe&#39;s notes on Eurostile
  <BR> <BR>Typeface notes: <BR>In 1952, Aldo Novarese and A. Butti designed Microgramma
  for the Nebiolo foundry. It was a popular face, but was available only in capitals.
  In 1962, Novarese produced a full character set, including lowercase letters, and
  the foundry renamed the family Eurostile. The letters are square-shaped with rounded
  corners, producing a look reminiscent of the machinery, technology, and interior
  design of the 1950s. <BR>Designers: <BR>A. Butti <BR>Aldo Novarese <BR>Eurostile
  is a trademark of Nebiolo.'

  body: Who knows? Maybe Adobe&#39;s information is wrong? Such things have happened
    before. Maybe Lino acquired the trademark? And who is typeblog and why does he
    care?

  body: Linotype has not acquired the trademark. <BR> <BR>Possibly Linotype is registering
    public domain typeface names to monopolize the market. <BR> <BR>This is not good
    for type designers who want to create new interpretations.

  body: If the trademark has been abandoned I don&#39;t think anyone can blame Linotype
    for attempting to register it. This could be seen as a self-preservation tactic.
    If the TM fell into the wrong hands the new owner could come after Linotype.  <BR>

  body: But Si there are several foundries that offer Eurostile so Linotype could
    prevent them from using it. <BR> <BR>And if a trademark has been abandoned then
    it is in the public domain and that does not give Linotype the right to claim
    it exclusively.

  body: If a trademark has been abandoned, it does not automatically enter the public
    domain. A trademark can be judged to have entered the public domain if it has
    become a generic term and has not been legally defended by a company claiming
    the trademark. But if a company ceases to exist or simply neglects its trademarks,
    it is possible for another company to try to register that trademark. The application
    can be challenged by other companies, or by individuals if they believe that the
    name has become a generic term. <BR> <BR> <BR>Habemus papam!

    <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s an interpretation, it warrants a different name. <BR>Such
    as Foundry Monoline. <BR> <BR>The only people Linotype&#39;s action could hurt
    are those trying to cash in on the original name and design, which isn&#39;t really
    type design, is it? Although it is font business. <BR> <BR>If you want to play
    that game, then why not register the name yourself, or challenge Linotype&#39;s
    claim?'
