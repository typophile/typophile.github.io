  body: Frankly, I don't see here anything... or rather nothing jumps out in terms
    of an obvious concept or a reference. Might be an E, but the slant makes it hard
    to recognize as such. Combined with a zig-zag, I would guess it has to do with
    e-lectricity, but again the slant is just too strong, and IMO it overpowers everything
    else in the mark.

    i have been given the opportunity to create an identity for a Mobile Electric
    Charging vehicle. The brief outlines the need to create branding for a \"pilot\"
    launch for a mobile electric charging station (vehicle) for 100% electric vehicles.
    the service will be available to eligible members in the US. The focus is to deliver/create
    something \"green\" and \"environment\" safe, convenient and service member focused.\r\n\r\nI
    originally had the E without the black border and without the slant. felt it needed
    a little more movement/emphasis, so i quickly used the slant tool in ai to get
    a feel for 'movement' and added the border. anyway, here are a few other ideas
    i'm kicking around. any thoughts are welcomed. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/e_6264.jpg]"

  body: I agree that they are extreme examples, and perhaps defining what about them
    is extreme would be helpful to hola if the project is still in process.  I think
    what complicates the e-charge reading is 1) echarge is not a word, and therefore
    not easily read, and 2) the hyphen (e-charge vs. echarge) helps a lot to make
    sense of the whole, but I can see why it might be avoided for graphical reasons.  On
    another note, what about bringing that left side curve into some of the other
    letters and playing with the line weight so that the /e/ feels like it came from
    the same font as the rest, and was a bit modified to add lightning?

  body: Ha, I was a little too harsh, I meant to say 'a little forced' having the
    crossbars all the same height. Counterspace of C is large, I'd narrow that letter
    so the whitespace has a similar area to the G. Still to me, I think you could
    find a better font for that part of the logo. Something a bit smarter and more
    fresh...maybe that's just me though.

    through several renditions of the E and found the green E the best fit for what
    it will represent and readablity. Stylized the E a little to give the feel of
    a plug/pump without getting to detailed. The pump image is pretty close to what
    the actual charging mechanism looks like, but felt it was too redundant. The logo
    will be used on a promotional electric charge vehicle and will have supporting
    messaging/graphics. pretty content on where it's at. any glaring issue you might
    see, type, kerning, balance...etc...and if it's to clumsy of type be specific
    as to what bothers you. =) muchas gracias. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/e_12_4747.jpg]
