  body: "My hunch is that\u2019s a customised Copperplate (or even Sackers/Engravers)
    Gothic.\r\nAs a starting point, both Sweet Gothic Serif and ITC Symbol have a
    more similar G, but the first has more contrast, while the other isn\u2019t as
    wide."

  body: Thanks a lot everybody for these suggestions. Sweet Gothic is, indeed, very
    close, slightly more contrasted. ITC Symbol has this classy feeling I always like,
    though not enough wide as. Anyway, that are 2 very good similars.
