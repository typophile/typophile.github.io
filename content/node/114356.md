    The next question is what font is it? I will go look for it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It sort of resembles [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emily-lime/bombshell-pro/?refby=bowfin|Bombshell
    Pro]] by Emily Conners. Her Emily Lime foundry, and Magpie Paper Works both have
    styles that resemble this sort of penmanship. It's possible that one of them did
    a custom font for the place you saw this.\r\n\r\nNo luck finding an exact match
    so far.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Another similar style is Eurotypo's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/eurotypo/gemmadonati/?refby=bowfin|Gemmadonati]].
    I would almost believe this sample of yours could have been drawn by the same
    person as this font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
