body: Critiques and help PLEASE!  <BR> <BR>Hello guys.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m in front
  of a dilemma! The logo seems to be nice but it kinda doesn&#39;t fit into any design
  &#40;web or press&#41;. Take a look at the mockups of the site. Also it is kinda
  falling left. Any suggestions?  <BR> <BR>Thanks!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/51400.gif"

  body: 'I think the graphic treatment of the 2 leaves or whatever could be integrated
    into the type a little better. Right now it seems a little unbalanced because
    of that. I think #6 is the best solution, but can be explored a little more in
    terms of font and aperance like increasing the weight and such.'

    copied ... ;-| <BR> <BR>&#62; Pavel Gorin. Pavel you&#39;re right. I&#39;ll play
    around with the font and may be will make the right part darker, and will add
    &#34;Services LLC&#34; and here we go, it should be balanced.  <BR> <BR>Regards:

  body: Garik, the mark is just too big. Its commanding more attention than the words.
    What are you trying to communicate a mark? I don&#39;t think so.  <BR> <BR>You
    must be old the USSR hasn&#39;t been around for a long time.

  body: Why the dot? It halts you after Swift &#40;a full stop&#41;, which doesn&#39;t
    convey speed to me. There is no .internet TLD, so that can&#39;t be it. It seems
    to be almost a cliche.

  body: Im not sure if the company name is SwiftInternet but i think you dont need
    to bunch all that into one element. What if Swift was there on its own with the
    logo as a mark, and internet services lcc would be its own separate element below
    it or where-ever.  <BR>Just a suggestions :D

  body: Pavel is right. &#39;Internet Services&#39; should be one item and &#39;Swift&#39;
    the other. It appears you&#39;re splitting &#39;internet services&#39; in mid-thought.

    9&#41; but the client did not like it. Even more :-&#40; requested new mockups.
    Will post them once finished. Much appreciate your critiques.'
