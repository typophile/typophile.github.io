  I've seen some for crazy prices on eBay, but I'm wondering if there's any monetary
  worth to issues that are not in mint condition. \r\n\r\nAnybody looking for specific
  issues? There's a few I wouldn't want to part with, but there's a good deal I would
  sell."

    issues</a> command the highest prices (although I could be wrong).

    issue 10 and 20.\r\nI would especially like to have issue 6."
