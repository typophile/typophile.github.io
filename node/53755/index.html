I know this picture is a bit skewed, but in my defense I was afraid to get out of my car&hellip;or stop, so this picture was taken while in motion.

This reminded me of the exercises that we had to do in class.

Again blurred, and again it was night and I was not stopping, but I really like this sign and hope to get a better image of it. So to make up for this I put up 6 pictures :)

<p>I really like the feel of the hand painted signs around the city, they just add so much character. The signs painted on the exterior of buildings tend to stay there as the city grows. Its not too often that they get erased, but they are actually embraced and not easily let go. Handwritten signs are also so unique, and you will never see a duplicate in exactly the same way anywhere else.</p>
<p>I feel as  if these sigsn are unique to New Orleans. Many of them hang right next to each other on the tightly nit shops along the street. Space is so precious here as more and more people move into the city. They are a part of the city, part of what makes it vibrant and cultural.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I would have to disagree that all of these signs are specific to New 
Orleans signage.The first two and the last work the best being hand made and
one of a kind. However, you should really reshoot them during the day
and hold your hand still so the images are not blurry.</div>
