  Edited\r\n\r\nYes, I believe it\u2019s possible to make an image better once you\u2019ve
  edited it on the computer, but there is also something about an image having a human
  touch that it makes it a bit more personal. Drawing by hand can be really good for
  practicing your drawing skills, but once you have that defined, crisp image on the
  screen, there\u2019s something very fulfilling about that as well. Really my image
  is mostly enhanced by the consistency in shading that the computer offers. You can
  also create edges that are more defined.  I chose a typographic piece from the German
  Art Nouveau section in our Typology text. I really enjoyed this era in art history,
  and so I wanted to incorporate this into my blog assignment. This piece specifically
  reflects the Jugenstil (the youth bohemian style) movement in Germany and was designed
  by George Auriol in the year 1900. I\u2019m drawn to the organic, flowy movement
  of the art. This is just one of the many examples that I wish to emulate in my own
  art work. "

  body: Although your computer version looks as good as a scan from the textbook,
    I really love your original! I love the color variations of the marker and the
    black color. It has the feel of Chinese characters drawn in ink!

    texture and subtle value gradients found in the original
