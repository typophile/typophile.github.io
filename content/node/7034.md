body: Does anyone know the details of how FontLab&#39;s .NAM files work? Every sample
  .NAM file I&#39;ve seen covers only glyphs WITH Unicode values, but my concern is
  when I have glyphs I&#39;d like in my font which DO NOT have a Unicode value. Any
  help would be appreciated. Thanks!

  body: Purpose of the .nam file is to map Unicode to PS Name, so it is natural that
    glyphs that don&#39;t have Unicode indexes are not included into .nam file. <BR>
    <BR>Note that it is not necessary to put names with &#34;uniXXXX&#34; structure
    into .nam file, they are processed by FontLab automatically.

  body: If you name a glyph e.g. uni0345, activating the &#39;Assign Unicode&#39;
    function will automatically give this glyph a Unicode value of U&#43;0345.

    values? I&#39;d like to do it only to make sure that various weights of my font
    use the same private unicode values rather than generating new ones. where can
    i add those values?'
