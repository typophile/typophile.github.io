  body: Where did you find the sample? "Camera" is an exhibition by Magne Furuholmen,
    former songwriter/composer/singer in the pop band A-Ha, turned artist. My guess
    is that it's done by some design bureau in Oslo, or perhaps as part of a magazine
    piece.

  body: "@ frode frank Wow bang on, the poster I found it on was designed by an agency
    called Bleed based in Norway and yes it was for Magne Furuholmen exhibition held
    at Studio Hugo Opdal in Fl\xF8!\r\n\r\n@ Florian Hardwig & p01ak thanks guys,
    those fonts are definitely very similar but not quite there. Maybe it's a typeface
    that's been customised a little, what do you reckon?\r\n\r\nThanks again :)\r\n\r\n"
