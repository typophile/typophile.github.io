  the rather headache-inducing kerning of them vector shapes.\r\n\r\nAll opinions
  are very welcome, as I am not entirely sure on in which direction to really bring
  it home. Cheers!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitledjpg_5854.jpg]"

  body: "I like it! Looking at it, my eye tries to assign it a decade, but it keeps
    flopping between 1930s and 1970s. It has that Art Deco wackiness, but that /L/
    feels sci-fi, and the /R/ reminds me of Star Wars and the old Chicago Reader logo.\r\n\r\nWith
    this type of face, I always appreciate it when the designer supplies a \"straight\"
    version, along with the more expressive forms as OpenType alternates. For instance,
    the two different /H/s and /E/s bring a welcome diversity."

    to be strange.

  body: Hrant is correct - the L does go too much toward the strange - less slant
    would work.

  body: "Thank you all, much obliged! It definitely had some art deco as a starting
    point, but wanting to move it in a much more bold angular/contemporary direction.
    \r\n\r\nKeeping in mind that the slant-L might be a bit too much, I think it's
    getting reasonably coherent 'standard' letterforms, and vague ideas on distorting
    proportions/details on the alternates:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot-2014-07-22-11_3571.54.06.jpg]"
