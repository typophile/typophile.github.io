body: "BOOK REVIEW: A Theory of Semiotics (Advances in Semiotics)\r\nby Umberto Eco\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Theory-Semiotics-Advances/dp/0253202175/ref=cm_cr-mr-img\r\n\r\nEco's
  \"Theory of Semiotics\" may well be a book of valuable content but I doubt if I
  will ever struggle through it to the end. The so-called \"typesetting\" is beyond
  pathetic for a University Press. It looks as though it were typed on an old 1970's
  Selectric ball typewriter which was badly in need of alignment. The text was appallingly
  slugged into the pages by an unskilled typist and then photo-copied numerous times
  to assure that reading it would cause pain and suffering to the hapless reader.
  The text is bold and blotchy with hiccups in letter alignment that makes one wonder
  if this were a low-tech pirated rip-off instead of the real thing. I would very
  gladly return this book if they would replace it with a text file that I could format
  myself and make readable. \r\n\r\nMy apologies to Umberto because I am a fan of
  his work in semiotics but the dear folks at Indiana University Press and perhaps
  \"General Editor\" Thomas A. Sebeok, need a lesson in typography from Robert Bringhurst
  or a visit from nearby Miles Tinker for a sound flogging with a pica ruler. \r\n\r\nChris
