<div class=commentbody>Hi Joseph
Well did you want <a href=http://www.linotype.com/580/itcberkeleyoldstyle-family.html>Berkeley,</a> which is just a rather pale ITC imitation of Fred Goudy's University of California Oldstyle, or did you want the <a href=http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/californian.html>real thing?</a>
As the Lanston site will tell you, this one was commissioned for a book by Goudy called <a href=http://www.typeart.com/reference-books/typologia/typo-contents.html>Typologia.</a> As I happen to own a copy, I can tell you that it appears very differently on paper than it does on the screen. Goudy set it large as a text face, about 14pt, with only an extra point of leading and a 27 pica column width.
Gosh but it's beautiful. I've noticed it on a couple of jobs lately – perhaps it's coming back into fashion?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the Info, I'd love to see usage of both but if only one to choose then the imitated ITC version.
I already have it and convincing the client to go with the original $$$ might be hard pressed. Is the original as feminine as ITC's?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Joseph
I'd love to post you a comparison setting showing how much more muscular and full of old-world charm the original Berkeley was but...
a. I can't figure out how to post images to this thread
b. The nuances between the two faces get really mangled by the filetype and size restrictions for submitted images
c. I think I might be breaching copyright if I scan from the book and shove it on here
d. If you already have a version of Berkeley and there's a budget consideration that excludes buying another version, then why post the topic?
(I know, you're looking for inspiration); FYI, it doesn't look bad as a text face; Goudy set it justified with very tight word spacing and not a lot of extra lead, as I said earlier. When it's up at display sizes of course it requires letterspacing in the capitals.
The whole thing about this is that the original quirkiness in the design – traits of Goudys intimacy with mediaevalism and blackletter influences – got ironed out when ITC recut it, and the 'feminine' character you refer to is just anaemic by comparison.</div>

Bringhurst's <em>[[Elements of Typographic Style]]</em> compares ITC Berkeley and <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/CalifornianFB>FB Californian</a> at large sizes. If you follow this link, you can download a PDF and see how it prints for yourself. Lanston also has a version of <a href=http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/californian.html>Californian</a>. I prefer Californian to Berkeley because it has more character and Berkeley has some real whaked out characters (that beautiful Goudy Q was just mangled!) If you want clean and crip, you may prefer Berkeley, but if you want warm and friendly I'd choose Californian.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ok here you go
This is part of a page from the original
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Goudy-typlogia-sample_3678.gif]
And this is my comparison setting using ITC Berkeley
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Berkely-typlogia-sample_6013.gif]
In addition to messing with the proportions, the overall blackness and some serif/terminal directions, the recut did away with the ligatures and turned the shape of the capital O to something a lot more circular than Goudy intended.
I can only hope he is looking down on the FB and Lanston attempts to rehabilitate his work after this unfortunate episode.</div>
