body: "It's been quite the day. We've all been burning the candle at all ends to get
  this launch out. And despite a significant number of both cosmetic and functional
  bugs, we felt it more important to launch when we said we would. \r\n\r\nBehind
  the scenes, we were shooting for a 12:00 noon PST launch. We didn't want to launch
  too late in the day, when it no longer really \"felt\" like 05/05/05. As it turns
  out, we needed the extra time as we were plagued were a swarm of latecomer bugs
  that had us frantically working until about the 5:00 hour. Sometime in the late
  afternoon, Yves Peters popped on and pointed out that the Typographica boards were
  blowing up with people asking about the launch.\r\n\r\n5:55pm came, and we flipped
  the switch. We pushed back our chairs, shook hands all around, and generally revelled
  in the moment. Typophile is reborn, five years after its initial launch. It feels
  really good.\r\n\r\nThen the bugs start rolling in. We're having some trouble with
  our mail server; we may have misconfigured it. Despite migrating everyone over and
  setting up everyone's email accounts from before, no one seems to be able to get
  it to work. Our own testing on our side hasn't yielded much either.\r\n\r\nWe have
  a long list of known bugs, and I'm sure we'll hear about a lot more. There are a
  great number of cool features that we had to pull in order to make this launch.
  We'll be rolling those in progressively as time permits.\r\n\r\nOf all the new features,
  I'm mostly excited about the TypoWiki. With the way the Forums have kept Typophile
  moving for the last five years, the Wiki is a natural evolution for the community-
  now we'll create a more permanent reference rather than posts that hit the site,
  burn hot for a short time, then fizzle away only to be replaced by another.\r\n\r\nLots
  of people know about wikis, but may not have a whole lot of experience working with
  them. The best way to get involved is to use the Indices. Click to a topic of interest
  from the Indices and use that as a jumping off point. Click on a link; if there
  is not a wiki entry already created for that word or phrase, guess what? You're
  the new author. Dive in and put down what you know, but don't get too attached.
  Someone's going to come in tomorrow and change it anyway.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yeah Jared (and everyone else)!\r\n\r\nCan I ask two questions (well, three
    counting this one for permission)?\r\n\r\n1. How can one post news to the news
    sections? What if someone newsworthy doesn't broadcast an RSS feed?\r\n\r\n2.
    I don't see a link in the navigation to the typophile blogs. How will users who
    aren't aware of them find them?\r\n\r\nThanks, and great job (again)!\r\nDan\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"
