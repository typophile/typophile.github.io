		<div class="commentbody">I think what bothered me most was the distribution of the various 'auto-features' and other preferences in various menus. I just wanted a &quot;turn this feature off&quot; checkbox in a Preferences menu, rather than having various menu items spread about the applications, or having to turn off each bit individually. <BR> <BR>As for illogical setups: for example, under the 'Format' menu there's an 'Autoformat' submenu. In that menu, you can click Options to change the options. That's logical. Well, the same options are under the Autoformatting preferences, which are stored under 'Tools&gt;Autocorrect' then you have to choose the Autoformatting tab, which contains about 12 individual check boxes, which must be undone individually. Why the two methods? Why is Autoformatting under Autocorrect? Why can't I shut it off with one click? <BR> <BR>Another 'feature' is Word's habit of replacing fonts it doesn't have without warning the user properly. I've had people <i>insist</i> they had Gill Sans because Word blithely replaced it with Arial and didn't tell the user clearly, indicating that it was still using Gill Sans. <BR> <BR>Now that I am forced to use Word regularly (at work), I know where everything is. But when I had to use public PCs at school for a few years and all of the options would be turned back on each time I returned to the machine. Regardless, give me TextEdit any day. I'd use WordPad over Word all the time, but it lacks a spell check feature. 99% of the non-designer users I work with use Word's formatting features to create documents that are <i>much</i> harder to read because they're bolding, italicizing, colorizing and underlining left and right. Word just epitomizes the too-many-features mentality of Microsoft. Instead of building apps that each do one task (or task set) really well, they try to cram a whole bunch of stuff into one thing. I understand the need for things to interoperate, but that's different from feature-bloat. This, in my opinion, just makes easy things more complex and complex things confusing. But I suppose this is a whole other topic in its own right.</div>

If you want to go to 'preferences' I think you are conditioned by experience with the Mac, which is a different matter than logic. It is what you are used to.  <BR> <BR>I do agree with you Chris about Word not having a single on-off button for all the autoformatting features.

		<div class="commentbody">When I said &quot;That's logical&quot; about the Autoformatting, I actually meant it. It's the additional path under Autocorrect that seemed illogical. <BR> <BR>Word is a good example of an app that has outgrown itself. It wants to do too much, but doesn't take the extra step towards becoming a proper layout program. It is, in my experience, an awkward middle step between WordPad and Publisher (not that I like Publisher, either). Granted, it's usable. I just don't like it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the second path is just helping the user. What is most 'logical' is whatever you would first guess just looking at the names. You might guess either 'format' or 'options' for fiddling with autoformat. Having the redundency is actually a good usability feature in my opinion.  <BR> <BR>Also all the extra features wouldn't be bloat or 'having outgrown itself' as you put it, except that you are forced to use them as default and you have to go through a song and dance to turn them off. That is what I really object to.  <BR> <BR>I find the automatic list formatting particularly maddening.</div>
