body: "Good morning everyone,\r\nFirst of all I want to congratulate you for this
  group, I have learnt a lot from all of you and your daily posts about sing painting.\r\nI
  am running a research on \"signs\" from the 50's, 60's, and 70's, I have found a
  lot of classic designs of lettering in advertising but I am looking for the artists'
  names who created those beautiful letters. I would like to know if you can provide
  some information for me.\r\nI really appreciate your help.\r\nKindly regards,\r\nFelipe
