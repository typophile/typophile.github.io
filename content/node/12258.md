  body: "I like it a lot, so far. The pinkish red is a nice complement to the beige
    and khaki. I also like the grey you used for the shopping cart links; don't be
    afraid to work some of that in.\r\n\r\nMy only possible complaint would be that
    the edges of the page (on both the left and right) are not so well defined, and
    the eye tends to wander away a bit. But it is better than the all-centred layout
    of the old site."

  body: The only problem is that the lists on the left seem to be floating in space.
    Though they line up with the overall grid, they're so far away from anything with
    a defined border that they look lost.

  body: I like the "streaks". On the smaller photos however, I think too much of the
    product is being covered up, so I'd scale back on those
