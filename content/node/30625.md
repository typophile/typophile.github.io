body: "I am seeing this odd OS X font rendering bug in Mail. I am running Tiger (
  10.4.8) but I saw this in 10.3.x too.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or a technical mistake
  in the font? (I suspect the later of course)\r\n\r\nA word on behavior: The misrendering
  disappears when the screen refreshes due to resizing or for some other reson but
  sometimes return again when the text is being edited.\r\n\r\nHere are my samples:\r\n\r\nThis
  is as you type - noice the ops of the 'el':\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_6452.gif]\r\n\r\nOn
  carrige return:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_4482.gif]\r\n\r\nWith Spacing:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_6069.gif]\r\n\r\nAny
  idea what could cause this? This is a Type 1 mac Suitcase font. But I can get it
  happen with TT too.\r\n\r\nHere are my metrics screens in case that helps\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_3500.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5_5067.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I seem to have fixed it. I tried several things ( bug.die.die.die... ) so
    I am not sure about which one did it. \r\n:-( \r\n\r\nSorry!\r\n\r\nIf anyone
    wants to know what the new values in metrics are I will post 'em for ya. My guess
    is that \r\n\r\n-harmonizing the win & hhea tables had something to do with it
    \r\n\r\n- and or making the hhea # add up to 1000 ( my UPM )\r\n\r\n- and or making
    the typo ascender = the hightest point of the dot on the i & j."
