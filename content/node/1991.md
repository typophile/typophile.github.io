body: 'This font was borned one year ago and was created to use to graphic applications
  of a music band &#40; Gothic/Industrial &#41;, and I give the same name of  the
  group. <BR>I classify as decorative typography and have irregular form, wich I mixed
  serif version &#40; Van Serif Regular &#41; with a sans-serif &#40; Van Sans Regular
  &#41;. The forms are broked and destroyed which give a wear away apperanced. The
  strokes and bars pass the limit of the guidelines which broke the visual references
  effect, like all most of overshoot references. Zeit Geist function better as display
  font because don&#39;t have a legibility concept to use as text.GIF / JPG: <BR><IMG

  body: Hmmm... It may be similar in feel to P. Scott Makela&#39;s &#34;Dead History&#34;
    &#40;1990&#41; &#40;<A HREF="http://www.emigre.com/PDeaR.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.emigre.com/PDeaR.html</A>&#41;,
    but it is pretty obviously a very different design. <BR> <BR>The same could be
    said about Max Kisman&#39;s &#34;FF Fudoni&#34; &#40;1996&#41; &#40;<A HREF="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.fontfont.com/shop/</A>&#41;, but again, it is quite apparent
    to me, anyway, that &#34;Zeit Geist&#34; is an original design, borrowing &#40;and
    only partially so, at that&#41; from a similar idea. <BR> <BR>I like the direction
    Zeit Geist is going, especially in the lower case italics. The lc italic &#34;x&#34;
    is especially interesting in both weights. <BR> <BR>David
