  of the newest growth industries is digitizing thousands, okay, millions of square
  yards of medical records is big business.  Ogilvy (one of the big-old gray matter
  Madison Avenue ad companies) opened a department that services and markets your
  medical records\u2014 digitally\u2014on your iPhone.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ogilvy.co.uk/ogilvy-healthworld/index.php/2008/06/\r\n\r\nIn
  a delightful meeting with Elizabeth H. Dow, Associate Professor, School of Library
  and Information Science, Louisiana State University the subject of digitizing information
  and its impact on stacks (those buckling shelves in libraries that contain books.)
  \ Elizabeth is on the cutting edge of making print information electronic, she made
  the curriculum, and in a spirited cry said \"but don't destroy the books!\"  \r\n\r\n\r\nThere
  are experiential and practical reasons for storing the original manuscripts, records
  and books.  On a practical level, to date there is still no stable electronic media.
  \ Further, even the most stable may not have a retrieval system in a few years.
  \ Think of floppy disks, Syquests and Zip drives.  If you don't have the driver
  to read your disc (or the original manuscript) your \"records\" are toast (gone).\r\n\r\nOn
  the warm and fuzzy level, reading from paper is delightful and serves a different
  set of emotions than reading from digital media:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/3562724/Hamlets-Blackberry-Why-Paper-Is-Eternal\r\n\r\nSo,
  please, don't throw out the baby with the bath water.  Keep reading, looking at
  and enjoying books."

  body: This makes me think of the book "Rainbows End" by Vernor Vinge. It's set about
    20 years in the future and one of the central conflicts involves a technique that
    can, at a cost much lower than other methods, digitize an entire library full
    of books in a matter of days. On one hand, you end up with very faithful, high
    resolution digital copy of every book that can be accessed by anyone anywhere
    in the world. On the other hand, the original books are literally and violently
    devoured in the process. A very good and thought provoking book, and not just
    the part about digitizing libraries. It manages to be simultaneously inspiring
    and frightening.

    our physical or psychological prejudices is weak. Things die - it's natural.\r\n\r\n\"Other
    people should keep reading books forever because I grew up with them and I've
    become emotionally attached to that ritual\" is exactly the sort of self-centered
    capricious indulgence that impedes social progress.\r\n\r\nSomewhat related:\r\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7886754.stm\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7907888.stm\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Love the handwriting article and thanks for the first one.  There's as much
    conversation about the death of cursive as there is about why books are obsolete.
    \ For a while I was hearing that children are no longer being taught to write
    but very recently I have learned that this is not so.\r\n\r\nhrant: Did you read
    the article I posted, \"Hamletts-Blackberry...\" its pretty impressive.  While
    digital technology brings information faster and faster, the experience of ink
    on paper utilizes different parts of the brain and human emotion.  Yes, it is
    slower and demands different behavioral skills that I believe we should not throw
    away.  For instance, why is it that there are more and more book arts programs
    in the universities?  If there were not a need or attraction to the romances of
    the experience of a book, the book subject would not be so popular to younger
    and smarter individuals."

  body: "This is an interesting conversation. With the advent of Amazon's Kindle (gen
    2.0), people are claiming that books are obsolete. This claim also occurred around
    5-8 years ago with the \"e-book.\" Anyone have one of those? Not surprisingly,
    this concept has yet to really become the full-fledged standard for reading. \r\n\r\nMy
    two cents:\r\nNothing will ever replace books. I love reading, love buying books,
    love owning books, and love talking about books. This will never be replaced by
    reading the same material online and my reasoning is as follows:\r\nI work at
    an ad agency that is making the move to digital and as one of the few digital
    user experience designers, I find it fascinating that people try to simply throw
    a pdf onto a computer screen and expect it to be fine. These are two very different
    experiences. No matter how \"user friendly\" you make it, people will not read
    online. It just doesn't work. "

    society considers hip does not turn me on (iTard, anyone?). What does interest
    me is the evolution of functionality, and the leveraging of that to help society
    (in spite of itself).\r\n\r\nJust because something cannot be fully replaced does
    not mean it will always be a good idea to preserve it. I'm sure writing on cuneiform
    tablets offered an experience quite unlike -and in some ways superior to- using
    a pen, but it still had to die. And soon the pen will have to die. And eventually
    nobody will miss it. As Bruce Sterling* has succinctly said: \"For things to happen,
    things must vanish.\" Serving the future generations requires us to part with
    childish, cozy nostalgia. It is like the unavoidability of death. Let's not emulate
    those vapid Oil of Olay insolents who declare: \"I will not grow old gracefully!\"\r\n\r\n*

    heavily onscreen (and benefit greatly\r\nfrom that) but I also print my own letterpress
    business cards.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "dear hrant,\r\n\r\nsorry i missed your response.\r\n\r\ni have a few questions
    if you are still on this thread:\r\n\r\nfirst (not a question) i think we feel
    similarly about evolution.  i, too, am interested in functionality and how a function
    plays out in society.  my question for you is, why do you read what i write as
    \"nostalgia\" and \"cozy\"?  is an old technology (print on paper) automatically
    nostalgic and cozy just because it is old?  part of evolution is adaptation but
    not all things that evolve die.  mankind evolves by adaptation.  as do some birds
    but not all.  we die as individuals but adaptation moves us forward as a species.\r\n\r\nhow
    many newspapers bit the dust this past week?  that's like some birds becoming
    extinct.  but we still have birds.\r\n\r\nthis brings me to my second question:\r\n\r\nyour
    business card, why?  why have one at all?\r\n\r\nso, maybe newspapers are no longer
    the most practical form of news transferal and its okay for them to go away.  but,
    why do we\u2014and you included in \"we\" because you use a business card\u2014continue
    to find functionality and merit in print on paper?"

    more interested in society's big problems, not the foibles of individuals, so
    actually I wasn't necessarily addressing anything directly related to your post/thoughts
    (although perhaps Libby's was in fact a catalyst). And you might agree that warm-and-fuzzy
    nostalgia is something that big chunks of society exhibit; and to me it causes
    people to intellectually vegetate on the sofa of their psyche, gorging on Rocky
    Road and watching their wedding video from the previous century.\r\n\r\n> not
    all things that evolve die.\r\n\r\nYes, but everything dies eventually.\r\nIncluding
    entire species, genera, phyla...\r\n\r\n> your business card, why? why have one
    at all?\r\n\r\nThat's an exceptionally good question. Maybe to leverage people's
    weakness? Including my own? Like I love lard, even though I know it's bad for
    me.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    of couch potatoes but disagree that nostalgia equates with lassitude.  unfortunately,
    we now have \"big chunks of society\", when in more rigorous times the planet
    held so many fewer people.  i often think of suburbs and housing complexes as
    people warehouses\u2014what are all those people doing?\u2014big box stores and
    many universities and colleges seem now to be services and processing facilities
    for the product of over population.\r\n\r\nwhat interests me is the functionality
    of print and HOW it functions, what it does and how it does this.  i think print
    and digital enhance each other's experience and use, which is what i keep writing
    about."

    is personal, nebulous and dynamic - which makes it very difficult to give good
