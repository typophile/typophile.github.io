  body: "Hi Don,\r\n\r\nThanks! Cloister Black appears to be a match, just need to
    squish it a little! ;-) Still unsure about the serif font. It looks very familiar
    but it isn't quite like any of the fonts in my collection."

  body: "I think the serif is garden variety Garamond Condensed, but with the width
    adjusted even tighter.\r\n\r\nCloister Black is dead on."

  body: It isn't Garamond. You can tell if you look at the way the top of the lowercase
    "a" is rounded and the way the top serifs slope downward on the lowercase "u".
    But I know what you mean. Garamond was my first thought as well.

  body: "Chris, there are dozens of variations of Garamond, a holdover from the days
    of metal and photoset type.\r\n\r\nGaramond Serial, TS Garamond, and Garamond
    No. 5  all have  a lowercase a with a rounded top and a lowercase u with serifs
    that slope."

  body: Ah! Thanks for the info, Kevin. I'll look into those and see if I can find
    a match. Will update on my findings shortly.

  body: Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be any of those ones. With Garamond Serial
    and TS Garamond the sloped serifs on the "u" are too rounded. Garamond No. 5 has
    a better match in that respect but falls short on the rounded shape of the "a"
    and I noticed a number of other discrepancies. I suppose I'll have to slog through
    some more variations of Garamond...

    and if I had paid attention to the period before I might have remembered that
    Goudy has a diamond-shaped full stop.\r\n"
