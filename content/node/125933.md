body: "The WSOP Logo has to be San Serif because of the serifs on the edges of the
  letters correct?\r\nHere is a link to their logo to see first hand the font I am
  referring to, I want to thank any one and everyone who reads this and puts forth
  effort to help me in advanced.  LOGO LINK - http://www.wsop.com/images/logos/guidelines/\r\n\r\nPS:
  I have already contacted the developers directly at the website, also the company
  that handles licensing doesn't know it either, The main reason I need this font
  is because my company has now taken over all rights to be able to sell merchandise
  with the WSOP logo on it."
