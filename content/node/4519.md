  body: Though I agree with you BJ, to me it also looks like it  <BR>might&#39;ve
    come from <a href="http://www.comicbookfonts.com/" target="_blank"> Comicraft</a>
    or <a href="http://www.blambot.com/" target="_blank"> Blambot</a>. I think they  <BR>must
    have similar stuff in their catalogue.
