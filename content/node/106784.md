  body: "Footlight has an unusual R, with the stroke for the bowl descending from
    the stem.\r\nI found three other serif fonts with this design feature: University
    Roman, FF Ankoon and P22 Alpha Roman. \r\nI was wondering what other serif fonts,
    if any, deal with R in a similar manner.\r\nThanks.\r\nDon"
