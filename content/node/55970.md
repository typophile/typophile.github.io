  body: "Hi Stewf,\r\n\r\nno, not really. I remember that somebody here on Typophile
    once argued in favour of \u2018spurless\u2019 instead of \u2018stemless\u2019,
    since it\u2019s not the stem that is missing. Looking at bdpq in [[Gill Sans]]
    (or FF Signa, among others from your list), that makes sense to me: there is a
    full stem \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t stick out.\r\n\r\nIn a narrow sense, \u2018stemless\u2019
    sounds appropriate only with the uppercase \u2018U\u2019 \u2013 as distinguished
    from the \u2018stemmed U\u2019.\r\n[[Spur]] is traditionally (exclusively?) used
    with the \u2018G\u2019. However, <a href=\"http://typomil.com/anatomy/\">Martin
    Pecina & David B\u0159ezina</a> also use it plausibly for details on other letters
    (b, e, q).\r\n\r\nBoth terms are used on Typophile, here\u2019s a quick survey:\r\n\u2018spurless\u2019:
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/5052\">Hrant</a>, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/17643\">Erik
    S.</a>, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/41436#comment-254628\">Stewf</a>\r\n\u2018stemless\u2019:
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/4138\">Mike Y.</a>, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/4685\">Marc
    O.</a>, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/5052\">William B.</a>, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/2388\">Kris
    S.</a>, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/18799\">Stewf</a>\r\nMaverick points
    for <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/40985\">George T.</a> and his proposal
    of \u2018un-stemmed\u2019.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/39388\">Nick
    S.</a> uses \u2018spurred\u2019 for the projecting terminals of [[Cheltenham]]\u2019s
    \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018G\u2019 \u2013 but I haven\u2019t found evidence for the
    usage of \u2018unspurred\u2019. Then again, that term would offer the advantage
    of being able to differentiate between \u2018unspurred\u2019 letters and \u2018despurred\u2019
    ones, i.e. those that look like they used to have a spur once, before it got amputated
    (FF Sari?). <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?&q=despurring\">Despurring?</a>
    Don\u2019t let [[Steve Jackaman]] hear about that!\r\n\r\nYou now may make up
    your mind. :D\r\nF\r\n\r\n(It\u2019s hard to tell from that pixelated sample,
    but I\u2019d say that \u2018wagewatch\u2019 actually does have tiny spurs on its
    \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018g\u2019.)\r\n"
