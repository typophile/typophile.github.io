  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The purpose of this card is to:
1.) call attention to passerbys. i want someone passing by to 
notice the card and know its for graphic design right away.
2.) something i can give to someone to remember me by and 
referr to when they need to contact me.

how have I tried to do this? I made the words "graphic design" the biggest element
rather than my name. And i've made the card a bright color to stand out.

Why the type bleeding off the page? It was to give a sense of "graphic design". 
I first tried just putting it big in the center, but it came off as too normal looking.
The jpg i've attached is the front and back of the card.
What do you guys think? Any suggestions on a better way to achieve this?
Thank you!

i'm probably gonna get clients that don't know anything about design
i plan on leaving them at coffee shops
giving them to restaurant owners

		<div class="commentbody">To call your work "really regular design" makes it sound like a commodity, indistinguishable from any other designer's work. Why not show what makes you unique, why a client should choose you instead of some other designer (or instead of making their own logo with MS Word).

For example, the logo you did for Cinder cigarettes was distinctive. Something in that style would be more likely to get my attention than the Bodoni treatment in this post. (Keep the bright color, though. I think that works.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">etahchen, I am not a designer, graphic or otherwise.  I think you need to see this from your customer's viewpoint.  "i'm probably gonna get clients that don't know anything about design i plan on leaving them at coffee shops..."  Many (perhaps most) of your potential customers do not know what a graphic designer is or does. Your card needs to indicate very fast to someone that YOU can resolve their problem, give them a logo or flyer or whatever.  This card may not do that. Talk to a few potential customers about your card. Show them the card, and then ask them what services you (the graphic designer) provide and what customer problems you fix. Find out if the customers are understanding your card.

I like very much the left (right side up) part of the green card. But I think you should delete the right side of the card (the upside down part) and provide a more prosaic listing of your services: flyers, reasonably priced logos etc. I don't know if the right side of the card should be slanted or level.

I did not understand, from the card, that you are a person named Etah Chen. I thought etahchen was a company name or something. Maybe an additional line indicating you are "Etah Chen, Graphic Designer" should be added, to make 4, instead of 3, lines of smaller type.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One more suggestion from a non-designer. I think the slanted listing on the right looks too haphazard. I would suggest a level listing of your services, in some type of easy-to-read script. I think your last card above this post looks good on the left side, although I would list your name on an additional, first line: "Etah Chen, Graphic Designer"

And I would put additional info about your services:
--logo design
--printed material: 
   flyer, menu, book,
   pamphlet, brochure,
   and more
--website design and 
   consultation
