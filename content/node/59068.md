  body: OOT. Why do you name it '_h' and not 'h.alt' or something?

  body: The aalt feature is a special feature primarily for use by applications in
    displaying variant forms in pallettes. In order to provide access to your alternate
    forms, I suggest using the Stylistic Set features (ss01, ss02, etc.)
