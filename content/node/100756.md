  -> e.g. \"12\" is substituted with  \"3\".\r\nWhen i test the font in Adobe indesign
  anything works fine, if you enter \"12\" you get \"3\" -  as expected.\r\n\r\nBut
  when i try it in visual studio, word pad or word 2002 it get a blank space after
  the substituted glyph -> \"3 \". \r\nIt seems to me, that windows always occpuies
  the space which was instantly in used by the entered origin glyphs 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
  anyone can give me a hint, what i have to configure to fix this behaviour. \r\n\r\nHINT:
  the glyphs are of course done without brackets -> \"3\" means 3. I used brackets
  to make clear, that i get\r\na space after the 3 -> \"3 \"  ;-)\r\n\r\nhope for
  a hint\r\n\r\nOliwan\r\n\r\n...may the source be with you"

    same software with common ligatures such as \"fi\"? Perhaps the software you are
    trying on simply don't understand how ligatues are supposed to work. \"Visual
    Studio\", for example, is a plain text code editor."

  body: "It's done with standard liga. \r\n\r\nIn fact, common ligatures within other
    fonts i.e. Gabriola, doesn't work?!\r\n\r\nPerhaps i have to make a specific configuration
    for the ligature caret? It is set to 0.0 -> Amount of ligature caret is 1.\r\n\r\nOliwan
