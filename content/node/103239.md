  body: "Some version of Didot compressed? Note the extreme thick & thin contrast
    and hairline squared serifs. But I don't recognize this version offhand. Perhaps
    proprietary.\r\n\r\nFairly close is Typofonderie's AmbroiseStdFirminLight:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AmbroiseStdFirminLight_5040.jpg]\r\n\r\nSome
    Didots, like this Ambroise and one from Canada Type have ball terminals similar
    to your image, while other Didots have a gradual flow into the hairline stroke.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DidotDisplayDemiCT_5659.jpg]\r\n\r\nDon\r\n"

      could do a digital swash version to match the creation by Photo Display, which
      seems to date from the 1970s. Nebillo's creation with a disco beat :)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TorinoSwashBasedOnNebillo_6515.jpg]\r\nDon"
