  src=\"http://kamiennik.nazwa.pl/font.png\"/>\r\n\r\nPlease note that it is not Courier
  or Courier New, nor American Typewriter. I've compared this three and there's no
  exact match. It is something in between.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help.\r\n\r\n(Sorry
  if my english is not perfect.)"
