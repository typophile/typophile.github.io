    personality. You'll get the whole superset for only $179 or you can choose parts
    of it as well. Have a look yourself:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com\r\n\r\nor

  body: You can buy only the weights of Titling Gothic you need. At $30-40/weight,
    they're not cheap, but hardly overpriced.

  body: marc is right. The reason the family is so expensive is due to its massive
    size. Of course the 128-pack of crayons is going to cost more than the 32-pack.
    But no one is forcing you to buy the big one.

  body: "> <em>Sophisto, it\u2019s in the same category, but with more personality.</em>\r\n\r\nI
    don't know, Stefan, Sophisto is a brilliant family but it's more of a tech sans
    like FF DIN or Klavika.\r\n\r\nFor alternatives for Titling Gothic I'd look at
    other squarish grotesques, like <a href=\"http://www.vllg.com/Village/GalaxiePolaris/mudTyper+Weights/\">Galaxie
    Polaris</a> which costs $199 for a 10 weight fat OpenType family, <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=MTcz&fontview=specimen\">Reservation
    Wide</a> which you costs $160 for a 6 weight fat OpenType family, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11463.0.0\">FF
    Hydra text</a> which costs $149 for a 8 weight family with expert fonts, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=paralucent\">Paralucent</a>
    which you can purchase in different subsets from $159 to $199, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=stainless\">Stainless</a>
    which can be purchased in subsets from Condensed to Extended at $140 each, and
    so on..."
