body: 'Hello <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to develop a logo for freelance work, to be used
  initially on a business card, letterhead, etc. Maybe later on a website.  <BR>I
  would like to keep the mark type only. <BR>My name is Robert King.  <BR> <BR>Here
  are four ideas. These are all in grayscale at this point... I will address color
  when I am closer to a final design. <BR> <BR>The &#34;KD&#34; stands for &#34;King
  Design,&#34; although as you can see from the other options, I&#39;m flexible about
  how my name is listed. <BR> <BR>I like the 1920s-looking faces, because I&#39;m
  leaning towards a non-coporate image, but I tried a variety here to get some reactions.
  <BR> <BR>The fonts are, in order: Adobe Garamond, Bitstream Clarendon Light, Toot
  Sweet and Bergling Fantasia, both by Nick Curtis. <BR> <BR>Any comments would be
  much appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Rob <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22932.jpg"

  body: I like the last, but there seems to be a little too much air in the interior
    of the &#34;G&#34;. It may need to be narrowed a bit, and maybe pull the spur
    up so the logo doesn&#39;t run all the way downhill. <BR> <BR>Have you considered
    being the &#34;design king&#34;?

  body: I like the verticle knock out version it has a 50&#39;s retro feel. Try taking
    the cross bar on the k and make it break the rectangle too. Also make the g break
    the rectangle cleanly.
