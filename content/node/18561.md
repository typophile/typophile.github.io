  good but there has to be others...right? \r\n\r\nLost-luggage has some beautiful
  ones but they are in th $200 range. Im looking for something under $80. And in landscape
  format.\r\n\r\nPS: I hate leather and the color black.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "i think David said it best.\r\n\r\n\r\nmake something. i had a friend of
    mine build me a custom wooden case for my student portfolio, and it's one of my
    most prized posessions. \r\n\r\nmodify something. vintage cases (upgraded to hold
    your work, of course) can be nice. i think the most important thing for your student
    portfolio is for it to be unique (but still professional!) and its always a plus
    when the material you are using to present your work has some sort of conceptual
    value or tie in. \r\n\r\nno one is going to be impressed if you simply go out
    and buy the latest portfolio brand that you see on Veer or somthing like that\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\njust
    my two cents\u2026\r\n\r\n"
