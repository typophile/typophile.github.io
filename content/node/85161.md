  site (read the guidelines already :)).\r\nAnyhow, I found this National Geographic
  Map from 1983 and I quite liked the fonts used in it, however I haven't been able
  to identify any of the fonts and already went through my 3000+ font collection one
  by one, if someone knows what are these fonts, I would be sincerely thankful.\r\n\r\nFont
  used for ocean titles:\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5327.jpg]\r\n
  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_4443.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFont used
  in the country names:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-3_5951.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-4_6422.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nFont
  used for the cities names:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-6_4518.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-7_4700.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-8_5806.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"
