    target="_blank">http://www.free-typewriter-fonts.com/</a> <BR> <BR>Whoever did
    this one should&#39;ve rounded <BR>the cap and join when they outlined the font.

  body: True ... also worth noting, the designer did the <BR>repeated letters, same
    distress marks thang. <BR> <BR>a fun thing to use to distress stuff <BR>is FilterIt&#39;s
    Fractalize Filter. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.cvalley.com/products/filterit4/"
