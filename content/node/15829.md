  body: "Well, it's digital. I know this because (real reason I'm embarassed) I typeset
    that maybe 7 or 8 years ago. Since then, though, I've had several computers -
    the one I worked on this with was stolen, I think - and 3 CDs full of type gone
    the way of the dodo, or other extinct animal, in that it is no longer with us
    / me. I can't remember what it is. I wish I could. I thought it started with an
    A, but I've been through specimens, catalogs, myfonts ... just can't find it anywhere.\r\n\r\nThought
    you guys might be able to help.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt : http://www.hewnandhammered.com
