  body: "That would be <a href=\"http://bertholdtypes.com/adobe_lib/080250000.html\">Berthold
    Garamond</a>, which Adobe no longer sells. You can still get it from Berthold.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/garamond-no-2-sb/\">Garamond
    No. 2 SB</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/garamond/\">URW Garamond</a>
    are also close matches and you don't have to buy the whole family. Be aware, though,
    that since they are knock-offs of Berthold Garamond, G\xFCnter Gerhard Lange,
    the designer, would receive no royalties, which (presumably) he does when you
    buy from Berthold."

    far as I know).
