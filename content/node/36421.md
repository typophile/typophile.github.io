body: "I was walking by a hand-lettered sign yesterday, and I noticed that the last
  4 words were really compressed because the person ran out of space. This is something
  that happens a lot when people write things out by hand, sometimes drastic, sometimes
  subtle.\r\n\r\nNow, a lot of typefaces are coming out that \"mimic\" handwriting/lettering.
  Wouldn't it be cool if they included contextual alternates that compressed the last
  few words of a sentence if found near the end of a line?\r\n\r\nI know that might
  totally screw with people's H&J settings, but is something like that possible?"

  body: OpenType substitution lookups do not, in themselves, have any knowledge about
    the proximity of the end of a line. But theoretically you could treat the squished
    letters as justification alternates, and the jstf table could be used to access
    them. But no apps currently support the jstf table, and there is no easy way to
    make one.

    characters? Swashes at the end of a line sometimes make much more sense than in
    the middle of a paragraph.

    he would finish the end of lines with tiny superscript. \r\n\r\nThis sort of stuff
    seems more like something that should be handled with plugins in addition to fonts.
    Seems like another great use for that awe-inspiring Arabic plugin John demonstrated
    at Typecon. Perhaps we should start a feature request thread over at Adobe.com
    and start giving them ideas for Indesign CS 5!"

  body: "Although you can't detect the end of a line (yet) in OpenType, you can set
    something to happen based on there being no further context. Make a class of all
    glyphs. Do something based on there being no further glyphs, and use a backtracking
    context. Not too hard, and pretty similar to other contextual font stuff I've
    demonstrated and shared FDK/FontLab code for. I'm rather busy right now, but if
    anyone wants to implement it I'd be happy to write the code for it whenever they
    are at the point where they need it.\r\n\r\nThe limitation would be that depending
    on the application, other things besides the line ending may break the context.
    For example, a font change will certainly break the context. Being in a different
    cell of a table would probably break the context. For *some* implementations,
    even word boundaries may break context, to improve performance.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: I suppose if you create the font to target a specific line-length then this
    could be cool. "40 column local gothic fixed" could be a monospaced font that
    drops to 1/2 or quarter width glyphs when you get to then end of the line.

  body: "There's the hard part: it's easy to make a font that makes glyphs narrower
    at the end of the line, but it's hard to make that sensitive to approaching some
    specific line length. My technique would result in increasingly narrow glyphs
    to squeeze more stuff in at the end of the current line, regardless of how close
    you were to any particular target line length, and would still do this on the
    current line even after some text wrapped to the next line.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I'd imagine getting the effect that Dan was originally thinking of would
    be extremely difficult. The problem being that when you substitute narrower characters,
    you use less space (I know, \"duh!\") So even if you could get around the complication
    Thomas mentions, so that this \"squeeze\" effect only happens at the end of a
    prescribed line length - once the effect is applied, the length of that line would
    get shorter, leaving extra space before the end of the prescribed line length.
    This would look like someone started trying to squeeze letters in when they still
    had additional space left.\r\n\r\nWhat you'd really need to do is detect widows.
    Once you find a case where a line wraps, with only a few characters on the following
    line, you'd then want to replace the last X number of characters with narrower
    versions, so that the paragraph would end on the previous line, and not leave
    a widow.\r\n\r\nHmm, it gets worse the more I think about it!\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "Hello Thomas, this assumes that all applications behave like InDesign, i.e.
    that any line break would 'end' a sequence. If I remember correctly, this is not
    the case with Mellel where the sequence would continue despite of a line break
    (the automatic one, not the 'return'). What would be WPF's behavior here?\r\nIt
    looks like there's no binding standards for layout applications' here, so it is
    not warranted that contextual features behave as intended.\r\n\r\nSquashing glyphs
    toward the end of a line somehow indicates bad planning by the writer, so it would
    make script typefaces even more 'human'.\r\nAnother approach would use abbreviations
    as found in blackletter, combining 'bo' 'be' etc, these could be distributed evenly
    throughout a line; I remember that in a hz-Program brochure there was a sketch
    by Hermann Zapf for applying this to URW Antiqua.\r\nYet another approach would
    include slightly narrower and wider forms of glyphs that allow it (also found
    in the hz-Program brochure) and one Stylistic Set feature would replace by narrower,
    another by wider glyphs, the designer would apply the one which would be needed.
    Or better, there could be two special features, one maps glyphs to condensed and
    one to wide alternates; then the layout application could decide a line is too
    long or too short, and needs condensation or stretching, and apply as many substitutions
    as are required to get the desired lenght. Would be a nice addition to the multi-line
    composer. And here, the feature merely provides the material, but the decision
    whether/what to substitute is on the application.\r\nBut this is not the issue
    of the thread which was handwriting.  :)\r\n\r\nKarsten"

    you substitute \"trendy\" or something, I might agree.   :)\r\n\r\nSeriously though,
    it really depends on the context. If somebody's typesetting a lengthy textbook,
    they bloody well better not get too \"expressive\" about the selection and usage
    of the text typeface. Or even a novel. IMO, typography is still usually about
    serving the text. Sometimes that can be done while being \"expressive,\" but sometimes
    it can't.\r\n\r\nThis isn't intended as a personal attack or anything - indeed,
    from the way you worded your post, I'm not clear on whether this is a view you

    context of graphic design. I'm not even sure that typography is the correct term
    for this, unless one uses the term in the broadest possible since of making stuff
    with type. The use of type in graphic design is a specialised use, somewhat alienated

    text manufacture with prefabricated letters. Typography proceeds from text. Graphic
    design proceeds from different impeti, e.g. branding."
