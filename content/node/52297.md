body: "A client contacted me with a font project for a MicroSoft Windows CE device.\r\n\r\nThe
  client provided two MS Windows CE fonts, 24 x 24, in regular and bold. They are
  in 3 different font formats: name.fnt.efont, name.fnt.pfont, and name.fnt.cefont.\r\n\r\nI
  tried to open it with just the .fnt extension, but a few bitmap font editors could
  not read the files.\r\n\r\nHow can I open the files?\r\n\r\nThey want me to create
  the same font twice the size, which I guess is 48 x 48. How much should I charge
  for this work per font?"
