  Heavy into his Suitcase. We're going back and forth on this file, and (among other
  fonts) have been using Financial-Avenir Book with no problem. However, when I sent
  him the latest file along with the fonts, he said his suitcase rejected the font
  when he tried to load it(!) I've never heard of this, can anybody help? He seems
  to think it's a Quark issue, seems more like a Suitcase issue to me. Anybody?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    company from which you licensed the type.
