body: I made a website for my folks but my computer crashed and was formatted by the
  {insert your favorite expletive here} techies at HP. Anyway, I have the rest of
  the pictured text from the site and was wondering if you smart folks knew what it
  was. I have tried the online auto-identification web pages and while close, they
  are not finding me an exact match. Thanks in advance for the assistance!
