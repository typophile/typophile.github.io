body: I am laying out a book at the moment, and I need to make a diagram simply showing
  fraktur (Black Letter) type. I do know some history behind black letter, but I was
  wondering which would be the best to show the overall characteristics? I am thinking
  something like Goudy Text. Possibly Fette?

  body: "Hi Courtney,\r\n\r\nstrictly speaking, not every [[Blackletter]] is a [[Fraktur]].
    According to the DIN [[Typeface Classification Schemes|Scheme]], those typefaces
    could be classified into <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_16518#Gruppe_X:_Gebrochene_Schriften\">five
    subcategories</a>.\r\n\r\nGoudy Text is, as its name suggests, a [[Textura]],
    which is the oldest branch of Blackletter. Then again, this very typeface was
    designed as recently as in the 1920s.\r\n\r\nSo is <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1608/wilhelmklingsporgotisch-family.html\">Wilhelm-Klingspor-Gotisch</a>,
    a Textura by [[Rudolf Koch]]. That one would be my suggestion: It is one the most
    beautiful Blackletter typefaces. And, IMHO, it is more representative in some
    details. Compare the letters \u2018d\u2019, \u2018h\u2019, \u2018z\u2019, \u2018A\u2019
    etc. You\u2019ll see that Goudy Text is more normalised, less \u2018quintessentially
    Blackletter\u2019. \r\nF"

  body: "Are you looking for Fractur or Blackletter?\r\n\r\nBut, just for grins...
    this was the basis for my P22 Sting. I am very much influenced by Zapf and Goudy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grave_4417.png]\r\n\r\nYou
    might want to look at Wilhelmschrift also... but I think you are right on with
    Goudy Text. It is an exceptional Blackletter.\r\n\r\nMichael"
