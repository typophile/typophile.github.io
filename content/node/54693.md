body: "I recently started a podcast with a fellow design student on the subject of
  graphic design and typography. It's called Read Between the Leading, we can be found
  at [[http://readbetweentheleading.com|readbetweentheleading.com]]\r\n\r\nI'm just
  looking for fellow typophiles, designers, and design lovers who would like to suggest
  topics, ask questions we could discuss on the show, maybe suggest guests we could
  have on. If anyone has ideas for a young podcast, please let me know."
