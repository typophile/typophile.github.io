body: okay, so i broke down &#40;in a moment of weakness&#41; and bought the full
  version of font lab the other day. i&#39;ve been having fun playing with it, but
  i came across a couple things that kinda bother me. maybe someone out there can
  help me with a couple questions. <BR>first - and most annoyingly, i had been using
  the demo version 4.5 and importing eps files that i had made with adobe streamline,
  but it seems that 4.6 doesn&#39;t support the streamline files. i keep getting an
  error message about the eps file when i try to import it. works fine in the 4.5
  demo, but won&#39;t work in 4.6 - wassup with that? <BR>second - <BR>i&#39;ve been
  fooling around with the opentype features and tried to fix it so that when one types
  1/4  &#40;one slash four&#41; you get the apropriate fraction substitution. however
  in previewing this feature in fontlab, the first slash doesn&#39;t show up when
  i type it &#40;oh wait i think i just answered my own question&#41; but lemme see
  if i&#39;m right - okay fontlab uses slashes to separate glyphs when previewing,
  so i have to type 1//4 to get onefourth. is this just because the program thinks
  i&#39;m going to enter something like 1/0145/4 where 0145= some character that isn&#39;t
  accessible by the regular keyboard? anyhow my main concern is will this be a problem
  when i export the font in otf format? will i still have to type 1//4 in other applications
  to get the fraction to work properly? <BR>oh and one more thing - i&#39;ve figgered
  out how to expoert postscript flavored otf fonts, but can&#39;t quite figger out
  how to export ttf flavored otf fonts. i mean i can&#39;t tell if my opentype insturictions
  are being exported when i generate the font in ttf format only because the files
  i generate aren&#39;t being marked with the opentype icon &#40;like other fonts
  that i&#39;m running in windows xp&#41; so i&#39;m slightly confused about that
  too. anyhow, any help would be appreciated. thnx for reading!

  body: 1. Streamline EPS files. Have you considered contacting FontLab Support? There
    is a problem report form at <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/html/support.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.fontlab.com/html/support.html</a> that you could fill,
    attaching the EPS files that trouble you.  <BR>2. No need to worry. The slash
    character works as an &#34;escape character&#34; only within FontLab. You can
    type /glyphname or &#92;unicode -- these are useful ways of previewing glyph that
    normally aren&#39;t mapped to the keyboard, or even don&#39;t have Unicode indexes.  <BR>3.

    order to get an &#34;O&#34; icon instead of a &#34;TT&#34; icon in OpenType TT
    fonts, the fonts must be digitally signed. Read more at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/dsig/"

  body: adam yer a genius! have you actually gone through the process to be able to
    sign your own files digitaly? if so, what &#34;certificate authority&#39; did
    you go with and how do you find those services? <BR>on a more personal note, i
    noticed that you&#39;ve had some experience with cyrillic fonts... what&#39;s
    your conection there? do you speak any slavic languages &#40;i&#39;m guessing
    Polish at least&#41; iv&#39;e been messing around for a while extending character
    sets for fonts to include cyrillic characters, mostly display faces simply because
    i&#39;m a slavophile myself &#40;i almost majored in russian&#41; and like to
    have cool fonts to correspond with my fellow russian speakers. are there any books
    readily available on cyrillic design standards? or is that going to be another
    big hunt for me? thnx for your help!

  body: 'Paul,  <BR> <BR>1. Setting everything up for digital font signing is tedious,
    I agree. But I am able to sign my fonts. I have provided some links about signing
    OpenType fonts at <a href="http://topica.com/lists/opentype/read/message.html?mid=1713339467"
    target="_blank">http://topica.com/lists/opentype/read/message.html?mid=1713339467</a>  <BR>
    <BR>Oh, I forgot. Rather than signing your fonts, you can also change the file
    extension from .ttf to .otf. In fact, &#34;.otf&#34; can be used for both OpenType
    PS &#40;CFF&#41; and OpenType TT fonts, but is recognized only on Windows 2000/XP,
    while &#34;.ttf&#34; can be used only for OpenType TT fonts.  <BR> <BR>2. I speak
    Polish &#40;native&#41; and Russian &#40;but it&#39;s my fourth language, after
    German and English, so it&#39;s not really good&#41;. I learned how to read Latin
    letters at the age of 3, and started reading Russian at the age of 6, so I tell
    myself that I developed a certain feeling for the Cyrillic script. I&#39;m by
    no means an expert and wouldn&#39;t dare design anything myself, but every time
    I see Cyrillic letters and have a feeling that there is something wrong with them,
    this feeling is confirmed by my fellow experts. But I&#39;d suggest you talk to
    them rather than myself. There was an extensive discussion on Cyrillic design
    here at Typophile and I provided a set of basic literature: <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/12232.html"

  body: am i responsible for this numbering trend? or is that just you? ;^&#41; i&#39;m
    quite certain that i&#39;m not as familiar with cyrillic letters as are you, but
    i love em. are there any cyrillic black letter fonts out there? has that been
    done do you know? and polish is on my list of languages to learn along with hindi.
    languages just fascinate me! i tried signing up for your list on topica, but kept
    getting error messages. guess i&#39;m technochallenged today. anyhow... thnx for
    all the great resources! someday i&#39;ll be as smart!

  body: Maxim Zhukov &#40;until recently typographic advisor to the UN&#41; and I
    drafted some ideas for Cyrillic design standards a few years ago, but neither
    of us has found time to work on it. Perhaps now that Maxim&#39;s duties at the
    UN are over, he at least might get back to it. Maxim has reviewed all my Cyrillic
    designs for the past six years.

    proof of your small caps for minion and just fell in love with the figures! also
    i noticed that you had some information on tengwar and unicode, any updates on
    that? i started a string under design on the topic. would love to hear what you
    news you have on that one &#40;if any&#41;

  body: okay now this post doesn&#39;t refer to any quirks, but i thought i&#39;d
    just tack this on to my current post. so here it goes... i am imensly interested
    in opentype and opentype capabilities and have have had some fun with some of
    the more basic stuff in FontLab &#40;like simple ligature subtitution&#41; but
    is there any text, manual, or other comprehensive set of instructions that breaks
    down how to program features into opentype? i&#39;ve been going through the fontlab
    manual and maybe i&#39;m just missing some things and need to go through it again...
    but i&#39;m also interested in learning how i can input lookups that aren&#39;t
    supported by FontLab at this time &#40;such as contextual and positioning lookups&#41;
    is there any way to do this? better yet.. anyone know of a font designing tutorial
    for dummies? anyhow, thnx for reading.
