  body: Every law firm uses the scales or the columns or the gavel it seems. I'm not
    sure that combining them really adds anything. It certainly says 'laywers', though.

  body: "It looks very \"clip-art\" with a lot of elements just thrown together.\r\n\r\nI
    like the slab-serif typeface, but it overwhelms the art. Also the other 2 typefaces
    for the ampersand and the latin text don't really work.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: The logo is too much of an illustration. Too many conflicting elements for
    logo retention.

  body: Way too much stuff going on - imagine all those elements on a business card
    or letterhead; they'd just be mush, and the banner at the bottom of the crest
    would have an indistinguishable border.

  body: Simplify. You got to many ideas fighting for attention. Very different design
    styles causing a train wreck. Just a few suggestions, take out the web address.
    You can always use the web address on other marketing material. Simplify the shield
    and eliminate some/all generic symbols. Try using the "&" somewhere else. Instead
    of stacking the names put them on the same line and incorporate the "&". Try making
    it work in black and white first. Then add color later. Anyway, just some thoughts.
