  characteristics of my style: globated head, rounding edges, small arms..\r\n\r\nhere
  are 3 ideas. please let me know what do you think about and where i can correct

    posture is horrible, but it's not that bad)\r\n\r\nI don't get the sanitary one.
    How and where would it be used?\r\n\r\nI looked at pictogram 3 before reading
    what it was, and I assumed it was for a cafeteria (two people sitting at a lunch
    table).\r\n\r\nThe short arms seem a little odd. You've probably seen these already,
    but check out Otl Aicher's icons for the '72 Munich Olympics:\r\n\r\nhttp://eatsomeeggs.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/otl-aicher.jpg"

  body: "It\u2019s worth trying out other styles than the one you\u2019ve started
    with. Free yourself for one moment from the preocupation that pictograms have
    to look \u201Clike pictograms\u201D.\r\n\r\nVery helpful is to [[http://images.google.de/images?q=sport+pictograms&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:de:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=nhsFS8HJMKbwmwOHwMyyCg&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CBQQsAQwAA|review
    sports signage]]. The \u201Ctypical\u201D pictogram style mainly goes back to
    Otl Aicher, who in the 1970ies declared them being \u201Cculture neutral\u201D
    and \u201Cglobal\u201D. But they are not. They are just the Otl-Aicher-style of
    70ies German graphic design (though that style has been very polular since).\r\n\r\nAs
    you can see in the sports signage samples, pictograms can be much more vivid and
    beautiful than in the Aicher fashion. Think of them being *written signs*, like
    letters. Take a brush or pen and *draw* them. If you hesitate with that, beginn
    with utmost simple pictographic signs like a tree, a hut, a tent \u2026  Then
    return to \u201Cdesign\u201D them.\r\n\r\nI did a [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-corpus-publix/|series
    of pictograms]] myself, a series which actually belongs to a Venetian Renaissance
    style (!) typeface family. For my own part, it works far more better than the
    Aicherian frozen bockwuerstls."

    is a consensus that typed letters need to look like written letters. :)\r\n\r\nThe
    Andron pictograms are very nice, and certainly more elegant than the ones originally
    posted to this thread. But I don't think the problem of the latter is necessarily
    the lack of pen-influence, it's just that they're a bit rough and imbalanced still.
    That's a matter of seeing and fixing, with or without a pen.\r\nOf course stylistic
    diversity can't hurt, but that can go different ways."

    I thought the initial question was much about which style can it be. Since the
    problem of the design being imbalanced has much to do with the designer lacking
    a feel for rhythm and proportion, which qualities to catch is the very goal of
    scribal training. For *this* reason I suggested writing, less for the suggestion
    of a particular appearence. "
