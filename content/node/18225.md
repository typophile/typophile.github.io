body: "The scenario:\r\nI opened a weight of a typeface I started in FL-4.6 Mac and
  am now working on FL-5.01 Mac. I then edited the file including making changes to
  kerning. I saved the file and renamed it. Then, I output the file as a OTF PS flavor.
  A dialogue (see first image) pops up asking me if I want FL5 to convert the kern
  feature since I made changes. I click yes. A status bar pops up showing progress
  that moves swiftly until it reaches 92% (second image below). Then, FL5 hangs with
  a spinning beach ball and freezes their forever. After waiting a millennium, I went
  to the Finder and force-quit FL5.\r\nNext I reopened FL5 and the file and tried
  it again with the freeze at the exact same 92% spot. Undaunted, I force-quit FL5
  again and reboot and start the thing over again. It freezes again exactly as it
  did the other times,\r\nThen, I start over as before with one exception; when the
  dialogue box asks me to rebuild the kern feature this time, I say NO. The OTF font
  file gets built perfectly this way and in jiffy time. I check the kerning in Adobe
  InD CS and the kerning corrections that I had done were all made and everything
  is just jim-dandy.\r\nWhahhzzzup? Is this just me or is this a bug in FL5 Mac?\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rebuild-kern.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/92-percentbar.png]"

    stop by momentarily, but let me just say this: ALWAYS click NO to that question.
    I don''t quiote know what, when, or why, but the fonts I generated adter answering
    know to this question work perfectly, and on the rare occasions when I have clicked
    Yes by mistake, my kern feature has gotten dumped.'

    I don't do my kerning in the Metrics window, but write a class-based OpenType

    have posted only the kerning relevant stuff from my recent \"Apex New\" font here:\r\nhttp://www.vllg.com/files/OpenType_kerning/\r\n\r\nYou
    can save this text as a .fea file, import it through the OpenType panel of FLS,
    and compile yourself an OpenType kern feature. (Note that there lots of accents
    and small caps, so you'll need to go through the kern classes to edit to your
    font's glyph set.)\r\n\r\nAlso note that this method requires that you clear out
    your Classes and Collections panel; everything resides in the OpenType panel."

  body: You're welcome Chris. I hope that they're not too dark, and they're really
    not that secret. I've had a ton of help with this stuff, and I don't claim expert
    status, but that class-based kern feature is really useful.

    the button will create or update a kern feature without classes. But better check
    if it did a good job or not. :)\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "Kern classes have their advantages. The classes result in a compressed size
    of the kerning information in the font and they also make it easier to keep an
    overview over  kerning pairs during production. The latter can at the other hand
    also result in an unwanted levelling/simplification of the kerning information,
    because the resulting groups can contain pairs that actually need a (slightly)
    different treatment. Some grouping can also demand a very well organized standardization
    of the spacing of fonts.\r\n\r\nI had a brief look at Chester\u2019s features
    file for Apex and I noticed that for instance P and Thorn are placed in one group.
    I don\u2019t know if it works in this case, but the chances that the Thorn needs
    the same kerning as the P are small, I think.\r\nI was also wondering what happens
    with the accented variations of the a when the T_a or V_a combinations are kerned
    \u201390. With this negative value I would expect  enumerating pairs for the a\u2019s
    with accents, but I could be completely wrong, of course.\r\n\r\nI have actually
    no idea how kerning and especially the kern class files are handled by FontLab,
    but from what  Chester writes I conclude that the kern class file must match  the
    font\u2019s glyph set in some way. In DTL FontMaster the stuff is actually handled
    in a quite straight forward manner: in KernMaster one can select a kern class
    file and a file containing the kerning pairs and the output is a kern features
    file. Because everything in FM is batch oriented, the classes and pairs can be
    used for generating kern features files for a series of fonts at once.\r\n\r\nFor
    professional font production a reproducible result is one of the most important
    things. In FM for instance the OpenType features output is controlled by standardized
    features files (Adobe syntax). If the features are updated or enhanced,  the improvements
    can be applied to all applicable OT fonts by generating new versions in batch
    in DataMaster. \r\nAlso reproducible kerning is of importance. I don\u2019t think
    that there is better software for this purpose available than KernMaster. After
    generating the kerning pairs, sometimes it might be necessary to make some minor
    improvements by hand, but overall KM will handle the most complex situations,
    including the kerning of Cyrillic and Greek extremely well.  \r\n"

  body: "I shall add that since version 4.0, FontLab has been using the Adobe FDK
    for OpenType code to generate the OpenType Layout tables, including the \"kern\"
    feature. So from the same .fea syntax defining OpenType Layout features you will
    get the same binary tables -- no matter whether you use FontLab/FontLab Studio,
    DTL FontMaster or the stand-alone Adobe FDK for OpenType. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
