    involved (depending on my background knowledge of the subject).\r\nCould you,
    please, give us a short summary about the client/product?\r\nThanks in advance
    :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The RRs feel just a touch dark. if I squint and look at them, they seem a
    little too dark. You might wish to lighten them a touch. Don't take my word for
    gold. Maybe somone else could back me up here?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I like the overall
    impression. Of course, I can only judge this on its technical merit."

    know what / who this is for and the reasons behind it.. And, I dont quite understand
    why the 't', the 'r's and the 'a' are lowercase, but beside that, I really think
    its nice'n'lovely.. :)</em>\r\n\r\nDav, <a href=\"http://www.formlos.net\" target=\"_blank\">formlos</a>"

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nThis logo is actually for a housing community. It reminds me
    of a 70's Pub. I drew it Upper and Lowercase just to be different, I guess. Kyle,
    You're right, when doing the squint test, the r's do have a little more weight
    and mass to them. Thanks for pointing it out.\r\n\r\n-Charles Borges de Oliveira"

  body: I will disagree with Hrant. I don't think it is important to have a unified
    case. As lon as the color and legibility are in place, it shouldnt be an issue.
    It gives it a little more character.

  body: "Mainly I worry that it might be seen as two parts, \"CAN\" and \"terra\".\r\nThe
    \"E\" helps, but if the mixed-case is kept maybe the \"N\" should go lc.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'I think your logo is very nice! I love logos in which the word itself is
    set in such a singular way that it becomes a unigue trademark and requires no
    additional symbol. I especially like the way the descender on the "t" and the
    bottom of the cap "C" follow the curve of the baseline. Mind sharing how you went
    about shaping the letters? Did you set the type on a curved line, convert it to
    outlines and then shape and redraw the "C" and the "t"? '

    it in Illustrator CS. Thanks for the kind words :)\r\n\r\n-Chuck"
