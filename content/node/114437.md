  body: "I thought it might be a Nick Curtis font but I didn't spot it at Myfonts
    or Dafont. [I might have missed it in my quick scan of the listings.] Nick's other
    free fonts are scattered over the web. Anyway, If it is a font, I expect another
    font detective will find it for you.\r\nBTW it's helpful in these cases if you
    give some clue as to the source of your lettering: logo, web page, advert, book
    cover etc. and the date produced.\r\nDon"

  body: "Good find Ryuk. Some interesting information about the designer, Alex Tomlinson.
    On his website he says \"I'm 17 years old and love to make stuff!\" Already 157
    fonts at Dafont. He might have great future as a font maker.\r\nDon"
