  this typeface is? looks a lot like gravur condensed- but slightly different. Any
  thoughts? And whilst we're at it, can anyone supply me with a list of a few fonts
  in the same vein as gravur?  Oh, and in case you're wondering, no i don't like his
  music. just the typeface :)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.willyoung.co.uk\r\n\r\nThanks"
