  usually 3, sometimes 4 people. And I'm the designated IT person, even though I know
  zilch about it. Anyway, the office continues to plug along, connected locally via
  routers and ethernet cables and we had to recently buy another external harddrive.
  \r\n\r\nMy questions to the Typophiles are:\r\n<ol><li>Do any of you have a server
  for your small office?</li>\r\n<li> What made you decide to get one?</li>\r\n<li>Any
  suggestions/warnings about taking this road?</li></ol>\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if our
  office even needs a server. But, the network I've managed to just patch together,
  combined with the ever-increasing need for storing/backing up files, makes me think
  that <em>something</em> needs to be done.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear your experiences!\r\n\r\nThanks"

    job files on it\u2014well, you can try to make them do it, anyway\u2014and then
    have one centralized location for file storage and backup. Hard disks are so cheap
    that its often less expensive to buy more space than it is to pay an intern to
    clean up job directories and archive old files. Need more storage? Slap another
    firewire drive on the chain. Designer calls in sick? Great, just open the job
    files and work on it without having to dig around on his machines for files.\r\n\r\nJust
    make sure that you test your storage/backup/recover system often. Because this
    will also be a single point of failure!"

    I had never heard of a NAS.\r\nThanks for giving me other paths to investigate.\r\n\r\n@James\r\nI
    thought file servers were less likely to fail (versus a regular old harddrive)?
    Right now we have a couple external harddrives that we back up old files, etc
    etc and I know that they won't last forever. I though file servers had a longer
    life, right?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Windows boxes. I just got hit with a nasty virus and looks like I'm going to be
    reinstalling windows this weekend. Having my files on the C: Drive, in hindsight,
    is stupid. ;0)\r\n\r\nA file server is just a computer with hard drives in it,
    so it's going to fail as often as any hard drive would. Remember, hard drives
    have a 100% failure rate, so the key is redundancy. Ideally, that'd be a RAID
    set up, with an off-site rotation of another backup (tape or external HD).\r\n\r\n"

    prone to failure than consumer stuff because they use newer parts that haven\u2019t
    had the kinks worked out (and because corporate clients buy expensive service
    contracts). But redundant arrays of drives can be put together to safeguard against
    a single drive failing. <a href=\"http://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?pid=10967\">These
    devices can be as simple as an external drive with two discs in a mirrored configuration,
    which is probably what you want. </a>\r\n\r\n\r\nJust don\u2019t count on this
    as a backup solution\u201499% of catastrophic data loss is a result of fire/flood/earthquake
    damage, and for a small office theft is next on the list. No matter how good the
    server is, keep a backup off site."
