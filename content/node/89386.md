  body: For the other numbers except the 4 (Kade would be a good match) it's reminds
    me something like Square 721.

      has done custom dial designs (including the numbers) for Swatch or some other

  body: "Thank you for your answers, very helpful, much appreciated!\r\n\r\n@sim\r\n\r\nSquare
    721 is a very good match. I was so messed up by the 4...\r\n\r\n@Mark Simonson
    \r\n\r\nVery good point, did not know that. Altering Square 721 in Illustrator
    will fit.\r\n\r\nCase solved :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
