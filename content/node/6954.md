  body: It&#39;s very similar to House Brush in their <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=SIGN-FO"
    target="_blank">Sign Painter Collection</a>. You could also look at the samples
    in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script06Pg1.html" target="_blank">Part
    6 of the Script Font ID Guide</a>. I have font samples from Art &amp; Sign and
    Sign DNA included. They might have this, but I just can&#39;t recall all the similar
    fonts.

    an actual clone <BR>of a commercial font, but many of their offerings over the
    years were clearly <BR>manipulations of existing commercial fonts '

  body: Hmm ... I didn&#39;t link like I usually do, not knowing how Dinc, with <BR>fonts
    of dubious parentage, would be taken. Now that I search, <BR>I can&#39;t find
    Gee Whiz anywhere any more either. <BR> <BR>Since the ReadMe for Gee Whiz states
    that it may be shared and <BR>that it is &#34;free for all personal, business
    and commercial needs&#34;, <BR>I&#39;ll send it your way, Christophe. I hope that
    you don&#39;t need anything <BR>beyond A through Z and basic punctuation.
