body: "I am employed at an advertising agency and we are auditing our font library
  to ensure that we are legal with licensing, etc.\r\n\r\nPart of this initiative
  involves creating some kind of font usage licensing agreement and/or indemnification
  form to release with the final digital files that we send to the client and/or commercial
  printers, etc. We are looking for something that protects our company from liability
  for external usage of the fonts that we release.\r\n\r\nCan anyone here provide
  any recommendations for what approach to take with this? Looking for standard legal
  documentation to customize for our company for this purpose. I see the standard
  EULA's for each type foundry and am still researching other options.\r\n\r\nAny
  assistance with this would be greatly appreciated. I'm not sure yet if having our
  lawyer create this kind of documentation is needed or not.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n"

    need to be indemnified: it''s as simple as that. Beyond that, separating EULAs
    into those which allow modification for internal usage (which is to say, not for
    resale as a font) and those which do not is as far as you probably need to winnow. '

    You could transfer the license to them, but then your agency would give up said

    your company and the type foundry and the EULA agreed to at the time of purchase. "

    regarding the editing of font files: fair use allows the reverse engineering of
