Timd, "Wonders of Creation" is what the 2 Arabic words mean and translate. They have been Calligraphied in mirror symmetry by:
1 Transforming and manipulating the main letters and Ligatures.
2 Welding Last letter of the 1st word (Ba) with its mirror and Combining their Nuktas (dots) into one.
3 Combing First letter of the 2nd word (ALif) with its mirror into a down-arrow to stand for Male.
4 Duplicating and scaling Last letter of the 2nd (Ta) to form a circle with the 2 dots to stand for Female.
5 Distributing Nuktas (dots) where space allows without sacrificing readability.

<div class=commentbody>Aziz, thank you for your explanation and illustration, how difficult would an average viewer find it to decipher the various rotations and scales to understand the original meaning and symbolism (I realise an answer to this question depends on variables and of course study brings rewards)? Further to that, are the logos for Reza Abbasi Museum and Abouzar Publication in the article clear to you?

Yes. But I made a mistake in my explanation to that masterpiece of art, though it is a possible workaround. There, the 1st letter of the 2nd word (ALif) and its mirror have been combined into a slit-arrow to stand for Male as well as female. The Nukta (dot) centered above the said slit adds more meaning to the female dimension.
Sorry for the Confusion.

You mean the ‘ayn with the dot inside?
It is ‘ayn not ghayn! Nothing wrong with it.
The bird has no ghayn but One ‘ayn on the head. And that's OK too.
By the way that reads Ali (peace be on him).
I Would like also to emphasize that the "Wonders of Creation" reads Arabic, and the bird sings persian (Farsi).

<div class=commentbody>>>Iranian Typography Now
The fascinating calligraphic and graphic design presented in this article does not help the reader answer an obvious question: Where is typography here and why is it used in the title?
The writer speaks right away and all over about graphic design and calligraphy, with a brief couple sentences about the how common day script works. This is another sad addition to the pile of misleading articles mixing the art of Arabetic typography with the art of graphic design and calligraphy.

Calligraphy/graphic design and typography are different fields but are closely related. Treating them as same hurt and limit both. I once wrote that "Typography is the art of automated calligraphy" some colleagues objected but I still feel the same way about it.

<div class=commentbody>Off-topic: I think it's interesting that many of us spend a lot of time trying to convince people that English (and other "simple" Latin, Greek and Cyrillic based languages) should be considered as complex scripts. And others spend a lot of time trying to convince people that Arabic (and other complex scripts) should be treated like Latin-based languages.
I think all written languages should be able to claim citizenship in both the "complex" and "simple" camps and people should not try to bar them entry. </div>

"No Entry" is meaningless today. That's why people like <a href=http://www.arabic-calligrapher.com>these</a> can claim simplifying the complex! and the fact of the matter, they are complicating the simplex.

>>them http://www.arabic-calligrapher.com/index.html
But Aziz, listing them (http://www.arabic-calligrapher.com/index.html) as an example is very misleading. They are talking about "Simple creation of complex calligraphic artwork" These guys want the old complex (and only the old complex) styles with any cost!
On the other hand, simplifying the complex (i.e. making isolated or one shape per letter Arabic types) is a truly complex and challenging task that can be used as an example of "complicating the simplex" where "simplex" is taking the easy-way-out by re-creating old available calligraphic styles and ignoring Arabic script adaptation and survival needs!

Comparing the 3 lines in the above illustration , you can easily see that:
• 2 spaces in the middle line have been replaced with 0-width non-joiners
• the same words superimposed (overlapped) in Iranian Calligraphy.

Si, this wonderful statement is what I am working for since 1998. Option needs to be open to gurantee survival. Any use of a font is a very legitimate use.
The grandfathers of Arabic calligraphy and scripts succeeded because they believed fully in this "open entry". The varieties and styles are so different and endless. Why anyone should close the curtain now?

Personally I do not like to use the words "simple", "simplified", or "complex". They are relative terms anyway. I one should look at it in term of open design and options. Thousands of Latin types today are so "weird" and "complex" when compared to mainstream types. Are there complicating Latin? No. It is about removing "any and all" artificial and arbitrary design limitations.

Why do you keep ignoring the crucial difference between restricting
options and trying to guide? Nobody can ever be truly neutral.

There are limits to how strong a parallel one can draw between two writing systems - both in terms of structure as well as the needs of their users.

Nothing fully survives any transition.
But the more important question is: how is it <cite>useful</cite>?

Typography is about design not guidance. We are not priests.

It is not an issue of drawing "parallel" between writing systems. The questions are: Why one writing system allowed open options while another one is denied them? Should all scripts be allowed equal opportunity to evolve naturally or only some of them?

<div class=commentbody>In the "Wonders of Creation", there was letter-by letter (word) duplication.
In a way similar to placing "graphy" on the right to Typo+Calli, the 3 letters common to the first 2 words here have been calligrphed with elimination.

As the fish dies out of water, Calligraphy dies inside Computer.
Any how artificial fish are not useless for Aquariums.

Not denied, discouraged. Because users are different,
and everybody needs guidance. Equality is death.

I have a theory that life starts when the cord is cut. Until that time
it's one organism... which in effect does not survive the transition.
An artificial fish is worse than a fish dying slowly in an unsuitable
environment. But an environment is more important than what's
trying to live in it.

First in its class + Very Cheap < 20U$:
Calligraphy + Typography + (software) = Iranian Tasmeem?!

<div class=commentbody>Oh well it is a big discussion guys. I see some how there is a kind of comparison between Arabic calligraphy and Latin Typography. While both are just 2 different issues.
One thing about Latin letters they are not just treated in typography, Latin letters have their own calligraphy too. And a lot of old scripts have overlaps and complex forms just like Arabic calligraphy. Did You think about comparing an old Latin calligraphic script with an old Arabic calligraphic script? However, Calligraphy and Typography are just different, and as the Arabic has been rich in Calligraphy, it has to be rich in typography too, and both have different values of quality. At least if Calligraphy is about the beauty of the sign's form, typography is about the readability and legibility of sign's form.. and excuse me, so far I fail to see the type of font in our Arabic world that really cares about " readability" yet, they mostly are a poor or clever transforming of a calligraphic font, or just an ugly/pretty display font.
