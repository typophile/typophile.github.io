  body: Yes, the files work cross platform. The only issues you'd have are with difference
    in what fonts and plugins are installed on the two systems.

    T1, going to Windows using old Windows T1 ? Likewise for other Win/Mac traditional
    encoding differences? '

  body: InDesign translates the f-ligature character values to Unicode in a document
    if the user typed  them on the Mac or imported them, so they will work cross platform.
    Likewise, other differences between platform encodings are not an issue because
    they are always resolved to Unicode. The only cross-platform problem that I remember
    right now has to do with fonts that don't have the expected CMAPs.
