  I want to contrast it with a serif font. For some reason, I can''t find anything
  I''m happy with... I looked at all the garamonds, Flareserif (sort of like elan),
  even other FB faces like Bodega. It''s just lacking the sophistication I require...I
  want it to look very modern (of course i''m using a 30''s font like Agency, right?)
  Very legible and streamlined. I also want to stray away for the obvious picks. And
  NO copperplate... Any suggestions? '

    FF Clifford or Tyfa from Storm.
