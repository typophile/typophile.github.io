body: "My hip collegian daughter is always pushing me to make fonts which she thinks
  will fit the design trends of the day, which seems to come down to fonts which would
  look good in the monogram on the side of the Adams Family\u2019s hearse, on an Ed
  Hardy t-shirt or tattooed on the back of a contestant on Tool Academy. Ok, that\u2019s
  the extent of my second-hand contemporary cultural literacy.\r\n\r\nBut she has
  a point that we work with all of these antique type and lettering sources and tend
  to go for the clean and perfect and aesthetically refined, while neglecting the
  demand for fonts which are appealing for their rough, vintage and gothic qualities.
  So working from samples collected by art historian Pedro Lemos, I\u2019ve created
  the new Montressor font. It takes its name from the narrator of Poe\u2019s story
  The Cask of Amontillado because it has a look reminiscent of the decadence of Spain
  in the later days of the Inquisition. It is a decorative initials font with has
  strong black letter characters with decorative embellishments plus some additional
  special characters for framing the initials. The look is strong, raw and somewhat
  gothy.\r\n\r\nYou can try the font out for free.  It's our new featured font at
