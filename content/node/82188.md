    but it was created for poor ink and paper. You have the advantage of better paper
    and ink so it will look good. You will be hard pressed to get a font that looks
    sharp with and inkjet on 80gsm, as by its nature the ink bleeds. Do you have access
    to a laser printer?\r\nyou may want to try a better grade paper, this should combat
    the bleeding and give the fonts a sharper appearance.\r\nA nice modern serifed
    font? Bodoni\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/atf-bodoni/\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps."

  body: "hi I totally understand you. i'm sick of using Times. and you are right paper
    matters too, although right now I print on 100 gsm, usually it's 80gsm. by modern
    i meant fonts created or designed in the past let's say 10 years. thank you for
    your reply. \r\n"

    (Ungers stuff is wonderful). Btw, Arnhem is a great alternative to Times.

  body: "I think Frode's suggestion is a clever one, and it allows me to toot my own
    horn: some years ago Patria was used to set an issue of a provincial newspaper,
    and the results -especially at smaller sizes- were encouraging. It comes in four
    weights with italics and a \"bonus\" slanted-Roman cut. And Armenian, but you
    probably don't need that.  :-)\r\n\r\nHere's a PDF of a spread from the Creative

  body: Miller is soooo nice! But I think that you are right with Coranto, that would
    be my choice. I would still be worried with the bleeding, do you think that it
    could stand it? What point size would you be printing Typeraisin?

  body: wow interesting suggestions. well depending on x-height, my choice of size
    varies from 10 to 12 when i'm setting type for printing. since you mentioned fonts
    for newspapers, i really like Guardian fonts. What are your opinions on that?

    for bad printing conditions, designed for cheap printing situation would be for
