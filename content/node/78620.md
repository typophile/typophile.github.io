body: "Anyone have any tips for creating a logotype in a similar vein to the attached?\r\n\r\nI
  know that it will take a lot of extra tweaking, question is will it take so much
  tweaking that I'd be better off starting lettering from scratch and not from a font?\r\n\r\nNot
  sure it is something that quick Adobe Illustrator techniques will provide a work
  around for and I'd like to do a thorough job, informed by some kind of strategy.
  I considered using some kind of 3d program, bending the text on a curved wall and
  flattening the image to aid my imagination on how the letters are deformed.\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to know what steps are involved so that I can inform the client.\r\n\r\n(Is
  this something that Cabagra covers in his Lettering, Logo, and Font Bible? If someone
  can point to a specific entry in the book I'll gladly buy it).\r\n\r\nThanks team.
  Go Knicks!"

  body: "Thanks Nick, envelope distort, all sounding familiar. Helpful to have the
    proper terms for the purpose of searching online. Which version of CS do you have?
    Might it have made it's way into later versions?\r\n\r\nJames, which edition of
    the book are you referring to, or is it in both? Amazon is offering me two copies
    (I'm tempted by the black edition because it is more modest looking) but I think
    the turquoise-salmon gradient one is the latest!"

  body: "I have CS3. AFIK, the Effects &gt; Warp is the way Illustrator handles Envelopes,
    and the options are limited, whereas CorelDraw's Envelope function allows complete
    user control over the finished product, rather than trying to force you to choose
    among preset options.\r\n\r\nAs far as Cabarga's book is concerned, go for cheap
    (used copies may be available at alibris.com or abebooks.com). Some of the information
    is useful, but a lot of it is out of date, ca. 2011."

    any experience of that? It seems to deal with the task fairly easily, at least
    before touching up.

  body: Illustrator--  Object>Envelope Distort>Make With Mesh will give even more
    freedom than Effect>Warp if you take a little time to understand the skill. I
    often start with a 1X1 mesh and then add points as I need them. Using a fine grid
    to match your handles helps too, when you need to be precise.

  body: "I think the logo in the example is, however, a hybrid three-dimensional effect.
    First, the letters away from the center are stretched to compensate for foreshortening,
    and then they're placed on a curved surface with perspective.\r\n\r\nThat may
    require the use of a program with 3D modeling capabilities."

  body: "This would be my approach - 100% Illustrator, no 3D software required.\r\n\r\nFirst,
    let's agree that the arch distortion below and above the text are equal.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/defxo.png\r\n\r\nI
    approximated Clarendon Bold off the top of my head as a close visual match. Curving
    the type will squeeze the x-height (as I will demonstrate in the next few steps),
    but we can remedy that with a slight tweak.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0qNy1.png\r\n\r\nExtending
    the height of our type to match the min. and max. height of the logotype helps
    compensate for the size reduction in the middle characters after we apply our
    bulge. \r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Bd8k5.png\r\n\r\nSo now that we have our nice,
    tall text...\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rBHuj.png\r\n\r\nlet's jump into  Illustrator
    Effects>Warp>Bulge.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ESvIO.png\r\n\r\nTweak your settings.
    I like to overlay my text so I can get visual confirmation that I did it right.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/01Da4.png\r\n\r\nAnd
    with that, voila!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Ds7w8.png\r\n\r\n100% Illustrator."
