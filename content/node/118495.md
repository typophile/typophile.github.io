body: "Hello. I\u2019m not sure if this is something that has been asked before. If
  so, please point me toward the direction to look. I am still searching the forum,
  but I have not yet located a thread addressing this particular issue. \r\n\r\nTo
  provide some context, I am a student who works for a university\u2019s literary
  journal. I have no formal education in design (outside of a few illustration classes),
  so I have pretty much been learning typesetting by trial and error. Therefore, I
  have what might be a bit of a silly question to all you type professionals out there.
  Yet, it is a layout problem with which I have been struggling.\r\n\r\nFor the journal,
  I design books that contain a collection of poetry, short stories and essays. My
  question here is regarding the width of text frames. For consistency, I typically
  use a text frame width of roughly 20p (on a 6-inch wide page) for all the body text.
  This includes poems, stories, and essays.  For both stories and essays, this width
  seems to work. \r\n\r\nThe problem arises when I use this width with poetry, and
  I am unsure how to resolve the issue. The poems that I get are of varying line length.
  Some poems may only be a few words a cross, some fill up the whole width of the
  frame, and a few have with longer lines that carry over unto the next line.  My
  problem is with figuring out how to do the layout for a variety of poetry in a manner
  that is consistent and logical. \r\n\r\nWhen I use the same column width for the
  poems as I use for the prose, it generally works okay if the line length of the
  poems fill comfortably across the page. However, it does not work so well with poems
  that have longer lines.  With longer lines, I tend to use a hanging indent for the
  remaining words that end up dropped to the next line.  In the case of poems with
  short lines, everything fits. However, the issue I have with these is that the test
  looks like a very narrow column that runs down the left quarter of the page.  As
  a result, this strip of text, with all the excess white space to the right, tends
  to feel as though it is sitting uncomfortably close to the spine, or to the edge
  of the page. \r\n\r\nI have taken the time to look through some modern poetry anthologies
  and have noticed some common approaches that these books seem to use.  I\u2019ve
  noticed that poems with very short line widths seem to have their text frames centered
  within the overall margin that each books uses. The text of the poems generally
  use a flush left alignment, although some are centered. Poems with longer lines
  seem to use progressively longer text frame widths. Poems with really long lines
  seem to break outside the margins used for the non-poetry text within the books.
  However, when comparing the text frame widths against one another, I am having difficulty
  finding any consistency governing the width of the text frames. Poems of certain
  line length do not seem to use the same text width.  What does seem consistent is
  that most the poetry text frames seem centered within the margins. The widths of
  those frames seem governed only by the length of the lines. The only adherence to
  any grid system that I can locate, seem to be used for footnotes, the bibliography,
  and any non-poetry text. \r\n\r\nMaybe I\u2019ve already answered my own question,
  but I will still post it in case I am missing something critical. Therefore, my
  question is this: In in order to maintain the integrity of the poem\u2019s line
  length, it is an acceptable practice to use inconsistent text frame widths when
  setting poetry?  I feel the need to be consistent with the body of the text\u2014to
  have both prose and poetry follow the same text frame width or grid. However, might
  this be a case where it is okay to be inconsistent\u2014to break the grid, as it
  were? Does anyone have any tips, or conventions that I should keep in mind, when
  setting poetry? \r\n\r\nThank you for any advice that you might be able to provide
  to this typography novice.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMichelle\r\n"

  body: With poetry be very careful to try to follow what the poet has presented you
    with - change line length only if no other solution works.

  body: "To briefly answer: yes, this is acceptable, even traditional.\r\n\r\nI think
    what you are describing is called \"centering on longest line\" \u2014 i.e., the
    text of the poem is flush left, but the poem as a whole is centered between the
    margins. This is pretty typical for poetry anthologies. In terms of the technicalities
    of executing this, I would not put each poem in a separate text frame. Use only
    one text frame on each page and accomplish the centering with the software's indention
    tools. Center the longest line of the poem. Draw a vertical guideline that touches
    the left end of the line. Set the entire poem flush left and then indent the whole
    thing to match that guideline. If you want to be fancy, outdent lines that begin
    with quotation marks so that the marks are in the margin and the first proper
    letter is aligned to the lefthand edge of the text."

    box of constant width as Joshua mentioned and use the application's tools to adjust
    indentation and column width. Don't use tabs or a bunch of spaces to force a line
    break, it'll cause problems if you change point size later, instead insert a soft
    or hard return as appropriate."

  body: Use a horizontal grid, so there is a constant multiple for the left margin.
    When I did a poetry book last year I tried to limit the variations to four instances.
    That worked out pretty well.
