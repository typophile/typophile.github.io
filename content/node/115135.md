  letters \u201CA\u201D (double-sided serif o top), \u201Cg\u201D, \u201E\xDF\u201C
  and the and the steep serifs on \u201Eb, d, l, h\u201C are very special. \r\nThis
  Typeface was used by a Munich publisher called Carl Kuhn, from at least 1915 through
  at least 1937.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!"

    I see cira 1910 as the design date. If we knew who Carl Kuhn used as type supplier
    -- Bauer, Berthold etc. -- we might be able to track it down, through the Klingspor
    Museum online  publications or through specimen books.\r\nDon"

    and you\u2019ll find the outlines are very high quality. Helzel has been at it
    for a long time; I think he even uses or used Ikarus. Today I suspect it\u2019s
    FontLab or DTL FontMaster, the latter being a spiritual successor to Ikarus."
