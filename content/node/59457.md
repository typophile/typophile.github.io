body: "I'm looking for a similar font to the one I have attached. I am restoring/recreating
  a map drawn after Sherman marched through Georgia during the Civil War. The damage
  to this old map originally printed on burlap is in such bad shape it can't be cleaned
  up and restored in Photoshop so I am recreating it. Fonts similar to Rosewood are
  close. I want to get as close as I can to this one without spending the enormous
  amount of time it would take to recreate/draw this in vector format.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help.\r\n\r\nJac"

    at font sites using the keyword \"Tuscan\" you might find some similar styles.
    You could also try \"Wood type\", \"Antique\" or \"Western\" as search terms.\r\n\r\n-

  body: I would think it best to avoid Rosewood for this job simply because its used
    so much people would recognize it and this might give it a less authentic feel.
