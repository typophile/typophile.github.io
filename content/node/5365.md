  body: iTunes has just opened in the UK, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be much there.
    <BR>I just started searching for stuff but none of the tracks I was looking for
    was available. <BR>Some of it was quite old and/or obscure, but even current and
    well known stuff was thin on the ground.&#40;No Red Hot Chili Peppers?&#41; <BR>Was
    it this poor at first in the US? <BR>Is it likely to get better over here, or
    am I going to have to get myself a US credit card?

    its because the licence deals they&#39;ve worked out are country specific. I&#39;m

  body: Dylan, <BR> <BR>Definitely not. There are moments of repeating sequences,
    but the rhythyms and variations keep it from getting dull or annoying &#40;like
    listening to some dance music when you&#39;re not in the club&#41;. <BR> <BR>The
    DVD has a short &#40;about 12 minutes&#41; film from the original photo shoot
    with them playing around a bit, and a 53 min film of the resulting live jam session
    that later took place in front of a large crowd &#40;along with other extra tidbits,
    including the original video for <i>Midnight in a Perfect World</i>&#41;. This
    music is much more organic and evolutionary than the tracks on the CD. Personally,
    I think it&#39;s great. Lots of energy, etc. Maybe not so good for just sitting
    and watching, but I sometimes work with it in the background on TV. <BR> <BR>The
    CD is a series of remixes by people in and associated with the group that performed
    with the drummers. The sound is very diverse. It&#39;s not all hip-hop-y, or a
    lot of complicated scratching tricks. The songs are a very unique blend of music
    that&#39;s hard to describe, but definitely transcend the traditional limits of
    funk, jazz, hip-hop, and any other influence mixed in. I highly, highly recommend
    it. Even those not typically into hip-hop can find something in it for themselves.
