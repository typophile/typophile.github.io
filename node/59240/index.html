		<div class="commentbody">*smacks forehead*  Duh.  I originally wasn't planning on being back so soon so I just glazed over the date when it was announced and have been unfortunately ignoring it ever since.

And as for half-eaters, most restaurants will have something on the menu, but since I enjoy my top-of-the-food-chain eating habits, I dunno 'em :-)  It's gonna be hard to eat Southern food without meat, potato salad often has bacon bits, collard greens'll have hamlock or bacon, same with black eyed peas.  

Other local restaurants that are good (serving more southern foods) Silver Skillet is quite good, near Tech's campus.  As is Mary Mac's Tea Room and The Colonnade (the latter does not accept CCs).  A friend recommended Fat Matt's for ribs and chicken (I've not been).  Bridgetown Grill is if you're looking for something more carribean-ish (with wonderful pineapple bread)

It's essentially a requirement to go to the Varsity, even though the food is about as greasy as it can get.  For drinks if you can swing the time World of Coca Cola is the Taco Mac of sodas.</div>

Well Matthew, now that you are coming back to the States early, I hope you'll consider frequenting on over to ATL on the weekend of 16&#150;19 July and joining us! It would be a pleasure to meet.

The main things I have to check are finances (I'm in between graduation and the money-making job) and the dates I'm going to see family in Alburquerque (parents and sis already bought the tickets).

		<div class="commentbody">Hi everyone,

Let me know where you guys are getting together, I'd love to come and meet you in person.

I live in Atlanta, grew up here, went to college here, been here 30 years (except for those 3 years I can't talk about without blowing my cover)

Know that Atlanta is not really a city, but a collection of semi-urban areas that sprawl for miles and miles and miles in all directions around the heart of downtown Atlanta.

Atlanta is *not* a typical Southern town. It is quite cosmopolitan. There are a *lot* of people here from every country you can think of: lots from Eastern Europe, Middle East, Asia, and South America.

Please don't read Gone With The Wind and come here expecting the same, you won't find it in metro Atlanta.  You may if you go outside the perimeter, in which case, you're on your own.

Note about transportation: you need a car or a cab. The bus takes forever and the underground is not spread out enough nor is it efficient.

<strong>Best steaks?</strong>

(pricey)  Fogo de Chao - hands down amazing! (Buckhead)
(a little pricey) Rathbun's - great steaks! (close to East Atlanta)

<strong>Best sushi?</strong>

Ru Sans (one in Midtown, one in Buckhead)
Starfish (Buckhead)
Thai & Sushi (in East Atlanta)
Sushi Avenue (in Decatur)

<strong>Best Thai?</strong>

Tamarind Seed (in Midtown)
Rama 5 (in Buckhead)
Surin's (in Virginia Highlands)


<strong>Best burger?</strong>

Flip (in Midtown)
Atlantic Grill (in Midtown)

<strong>Best seafood?</strong>

(pricey) Atlanta Fish Market (in Buckhead, it's not a market, it's just a restaurant with that name)

<strong>Best vegetarian?</strong>

Cafe Sunflower (in Buckhead)

note: vegetarian options are available now in most restaurants

<strong>Best sandwich place?</strong>

Alon's (in Decatur)

<strong>Best nice little place to eat?</strong>

Carroll Street Cafe (in East Atlanta)

<strong>Best laid-back club/bar?</strong>

Cosmo/Lava (in Midtown)

<strong>Best techno club?</strong>

Opera (in Midtown)

Don't forget to visit the Georgia Aquarium if you have time. High Museum, if you want a museum. Piedmont Park and Stone Mountain, for outdoorsy types.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Rahim

p.s. If you are here for a few extra days, please rent a car and drive down to Savannah (2.5 hours by car) and stay at a bed and breakfast. You will really enjoy it. It's really nice, lots of restaurants, nice art scene, Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD).
