  are several interesting remarks about the history and characteristic of the armenian
  script. In relation to one of them Maxim remarked: \"I am not sure of that 'Eastern
  letters horizontal / Western letters vertical' bit, though.\" This remark relates
  I guess to the thread here about cartesian space, as well as some of the diiscussion
  in the bouma as bounded map thread.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

  body: "Peter, fascinating graph, but could you please explain it more?\r\n\r\nI
    can see how Arabic is more horizontal where Latin is more vertical on some level,
    but in other ways it's the other way around... Also, concerning Armenian:\r\n1)
    One of the reasons it was invented (the reason that got the not-particularly-godfearing
    King Vramshabouh to fund the effort) was to prevent the Armenian entity from being
    fractured between the two powers that were sitting on it; so leaning to one side
    or another was exactly what they would NOT have done.\r\n2) To me it seems that
    Armenian is MORE vertical than Latin! Stucturally the x-height region especially
    is severely vertical (with the stroke contrast being like Latin) and the script
    is also Cartesially more vertical. Have you run my sample through your process
    yet?\r\n\r\nBTW, there seems to be a mistake in the Arabic: as far as I know the
    raHmaan (third word of the first line) has a \"long-short\" floating alif (fatHa)
    as the last vowel - no idea what the actual name of it is - but basically it floats
    like the fatHa, but it's vertical, and it's pronounced as a long alif.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
