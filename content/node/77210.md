body: "Hello Everybody,\r\n\r\nAs Expletus Sans is coming to completion, I started
  working on some new ideas. After I had drawn the a I just had to complete the lowercase.
  It's still in a very early stage of the design process, so no proper spacing/kerning
  except the kerning already in Adobe Garamond. It's not exactly based on Garamonds
  proportions, but I did use it as a reference, so for now the name Garamond Sans
  will do. Before you comment any serious critique I would like to know if you know
  of any similar fonts. Hope you like it!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper de Waard\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/garamond-sans_6355.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks Stephen. It just seems so unlikely nobody has ever tried to cut off
    the serifs of a serif typeface and keep the contrast the same. Do you have any
    critique on colour, width, optical illusions, shape, etc.? Is the comma working
    for you?

  body: "Looks promising!\r\n\r\nThe /z/ looks too light to me, as well as the comma.\r\nI
    think there\u2019s a slight overall weight discrepancy between the (originally)
    serifed characters and the non-serifed.\r\n\r\nBut I like the rather compact shape
    of the /c/ and the rather solid tittles.\r\n\r\nAnother font in that category
    would be http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/aroma/"

  body: Jasper, have a look at [[http://www.typonine.com/fonts/nota/|Nota]] by Nikola
    Djurek. IMO, one of the best and most underrated releases this year.

  body: "Did you just chop them off? :) In y, the serifs obviously played a big part
    in adding weight. Your w also suffers from this. I\u2019ve used Relato Sans quite
    a bit which have a similar unconnected k and it always bothers me. I would reconsider
    that one."

  body: "@ Joerg: I just added some weight to the z and comma, so it's good to hear
    my eyes told the truth. I based in somewhat on Garamond to speeden up the design
    process. It's not meant as a sans-serif companion for Garamond. On of the many
    changes I've made so far is decreasing the length of the ascenders, which I couldn't/shouldn't
    have done if it was a companion for Garamond. The tittles are Garamond's size
    and I like them too. I find the c too wide in many typefaces. I guess I didn't
    make mine too compressed then. =D\r\n\r\n@ Frode: The k in Relato sans has a much
    wider gap. The gap in Sensa (I've decided to name it Sensa now) disappears at
    text sizes. I have made changes to every glyph shown above, many of them increasing/decreasing
    weight, so I hope what you say about the y is fixed now.\r\n\r\nThanks for your
    comments guys. I'll upload an update in a few days.\r\n"
