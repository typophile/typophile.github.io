  body: Despite the high prices on the ones already mentioned, all of these are so
    much cheaper (and especially the cost of an average font being now $25 or so for
    an individual license!) than what it used to cost back in the day. I can remember
    ordering a whole slew of types for a Monotype LaserComp in the 1980s and it was
    mucho thousands of dollars. Jackie, do you remember how much it was to buy fonts
    for an even earlier Alphatype or VIP system? And for that matter, I wonder how
    much one paid for a nice full magazine of Linotype mats when those were being
    sold new, retail, and made in the U.S.? Adjusted for 2007 dollars probably not
    cheap, either. (Forgive me if this is considered to be a highjack.)

  body: I don't think this is off-topic, but if you consider the question of the 'most
    expensive' then maybe custom work would be included? In that case I'd guess that
    one of the Windows core fonts, let's say Times New Roman, would have cost the
    most to develop and maintain over the past 20 years - and that's a font many end-users
    consider free.

    then you can easily spot unlicenced use.\r\n3. If people are paying that much,
    they are less likely to copy the font for their friends, and might even be careful
    about embedding it and such.\r\n4. Having the most expensive font might bring
    at least a little fame or notoriety within the font community.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I think the most expensive font you can own -- is asking a type designer
    to design an exclusive font for you -- and have fun negotiating a price.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,
    depending on what year you bought commercial fonts, I spent more than 900 US Dollars
    for the Gill Sans family from Monotype. I couldn't believe I was spending it.
    But considering I owned it all on typositor at $30 a weight, and on Alphatype
    $60 per weight -- spending the 900+ seemed like a bargain -- it included more
    weights than the typositor or typesetter did.\r\n\r\nMost I was ever taken for
    at one time -- Adobe. They put me on an automatic font release program. One January
    I came in on a bill for over $1500 -- it was everything I didn't need, old style
    numbers, mathematical fonts...how do I say it nicely? I was pi**ed."

    Dolly and Sauna from 'Underware'. They are good fonts, at a really reasonable
    price. Those, as well as some fonts from OurType ( Versa, for instance ) make
    me wanna buy the font, and use it in my work. In that way, you keep a good market
    for typefaces which also increases the quality.

    them. Those who want good fonts, will have to pay for the work that goes into
    making the good ones.\r\n\r\nAs for relative costs, in my lifetime fonts have
    gone from costing about as much as a house (to get a family of Linotype matrices,
    for instance) to less than I earn in an hour (for a single font).\r\n\r\nSo I
    can't complain about font prices. "
