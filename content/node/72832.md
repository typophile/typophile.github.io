body: "Hi everybody,\r\nI have run some tests in order to evaluate the legibility
  of the fonts included in the \"<a href=\"http://code.google.com/webfonts\">Google
  font directory</a>\".\r\nI have tried to read a text at about 50cm from my screen
  and evaluated the legibility of each of the 18 fonts from 9 to 18pt x-height with
  3 levels : non-legible / difficult legibility / good legibility.\r\nThe tests have
  been run up on Firefox (last version) and 3 OS : Mac OS-X / Win Vista and Win XP.\r\n\r\nThe
  results of these tests are included in a <strong>pdf document</strong>, a kind of
  \"Google fonts legibility cheat sheet\".\r\nIf you are interested, you could <strong>download
  it for free</strong> (CC-licence). \r\nHere is the link : <strong><a href=\"http://all-for-design.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/gfd/gdf-english.pdf\">Google
  fonts legibility</a></strong>.\r\n\r\nI have written <a href=\"http://all-for-design.com/typographie/google-fonts-tests-de-lisibilite\">an
  article (fr)</a> to explain my methodology on my blog. I will try to make an english
  translation when I would have some extra time.\r\n\r\nI think this pdf could be
  useful for everyone who wanted to choose a legible display font in the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/webfonts\">Google
  font directory</a> to be used on the web.\r\n\r\n<em>a french version of the pdf
  is available here : <strong><a href=\"http://all-for-design.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/gfd/gdf-french.pdf\">Google
  fonts legibility (fr)</a></strong></em>"

  body: That was pretty interesting. Google Translate did a good job translating your
    blog, for anyone looking to read it in English. As a colorblind person, I found
    it a little tough to read your charts, but it's no big deal. Good research and
    good information.
