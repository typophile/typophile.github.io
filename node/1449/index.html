<div class=commentbody>I rather enjoyed Gerry Leonidas' talk, John Hudson's new Hebrew face, Gerald Cinamon's Koch slides (lots of stuff not in the book), the House of Downer demo, everything really. I only regret not being able to be in three places at once for some of those presentations. I really wanted to see more. That's probably the best complaint they can get. <br> <br>The food, well... I guess I understand now why I've never heard of one going out to a Canadian restaurant. I preferred Leipzig. If I weren't allergic to seafood, I might have enjoyed the food more. <br> <br>So now that it's Monday, check out the announcement from <a href=http://www.adobe.com/>Adobe</a>.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I hate to start w/ a negative, but the worst thing for me at the conference were the name tags! I found them difficult to read further than 2-3 feet away. I'm naturally shy and intimidated by crowds, and I find it very difficult to walk up to people and say: "Hi! Who are you?" I would have liked to have met more people from the on-line forums ... oh, well. Next time. <br> <br>For me, the best talk was the Kevin Larson/Gerald Unger combination re: Word Recognition & Legibility. Lots of good information, I'm just sorry hhp wasn't there to cross swords w/ Kevin :o) I also thought the font business series was good. <br> <br>Vancouver is beautiful, and the weather was fantastic. It was very difficult to stay indoors; more than once I was tempted to steal a sailboat, head West & keep on going. <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>1. best talk ? Unger on reading. <br>2. worst thing ? Deciding not to go for broke on the volume of French Revolution newspapers in the auction. <br>3. best dancer ? Ms Weissman, of course. <br>4. best dresser ? Nothing of note. <br>5. most ironic ? Well, more of a coincidence, actually. Over sushi with Cyrus, I was complaining (as is my wont) of the stale state of typography in mass market magazines available at airports, but mentioned that there was one exception, but I couldn't remember the magazine name or identify the headline font, so I drew him a couple of characters. "Oh, was that Natural Health?" says Cyrus, "That's the first issue and a new face I just designed." <br> <br>6. Best quote? "The choice of type is based on reputation and trends, rather than any kind of logic." - Roger Black</div>

<div class=commentbody>The highest point in the ATypI conference in Vancouver was in having all those type luminaries in my home town. <br> <br>Taking Dan Carr and paul Razell to the Ho Sun Hing Printing Co, type foundry for a tour and demo of Chinese type casting was also a pleasure. <br> <br>It was not easy to get Fontlab information from the young men doing the digital work on the typeface during John Downer's Font Sprint, but I realize they were busy trying to drain the swamp. (Fontlab does look like a hell of a program) <br> <br>John Downer's signwriting ability just floored me. Such a talent! And very nice guy as well. <br> <br>And to top it off, I always enjoy hanging around the False Creek waterway. <br> <br>The disappointing part is that I managed to meet very few type designers, and would have liked to have had the time to get peole to visit my own metal foundry. <br> <br>All in all, I had a nice time, and wasn't completely put off the conference on by the doubtful quality of the red wine. <br> <br>Jim Rimmer <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>PowerPoint is actually a great program to write and put together a presentation as a structured document. It's how people use it that makes it a bad thing. The slide sorter view is really good, as well as the outline mode. InDesign doesn't compare when it comes to this. Try organizing your pages in the pages palette. It's a nightmere. <br> <br>Though I still do my presentations in InDesign and present in Acrobat. That's what I did for mine at ATypI. Can't do without the typographic sophistication. No kerning? Forget it! I'm tempted to try Keynote. Would any of you recomment it? I've noticed a few presenters used Keynote. I love the cinematic cross-dissolve!</div>

<div class=commentbody>John: <br>I don't think PowerPoint can take PDF as an import format. However, if you have Acrobat 6 Pro, you can export PDF from PowerPoint and have it even map transitions to their closest PDF equivalents. I haven't played with this much, since I think fancy transitions are often a distraction, so I can't say how well it works. <br> <br>Keith: <br>I agree wholeheartedly that PowerPoint is great for managing structured presentations. That's why I still use it even though the typography sucks so badly. However, when time allows I do the initial version in PowerPoint and then redo it all in InDesign when I'm done.... <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>I do my presentation in Acrobat too for couple of year and very happy with result, and more fun when you move to the next page via a BlueTooth phone, hehe. <br> <br>But yes, a template sometime can be good.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I do use Keynote for all my presentations, client and public. <br>The great thing is, you can prepare your stuff in Illustrator or InDesign, it reads PDFs and EPS files without choking! Normally I'd do all the stuff directly in Keynote which works well. And to the Kern Monkey: The text looks good! Open your eyes again this ain't no Microsoft! <br> <br>If I run around during a presentation it'll either be my mobile phone or a rc-remote. <br> <br>Did this help anyone? I still have to figure out how to join this... Hey guys, what money? Help me to join!</div>

<div class=commentbody>To be fair, it was pissing with rain most of this week, and we've had major flooding in the mountains around Vancouver, with bridges washed out, lives lost, homes destroyed, etc. But yes, today the sun is shining and I'm about to leave my computer and go to a certain cafe that many ATypI attendees agree serves the best coffee.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John -- <br> <br>Sorry to hear about the floods, hope you weren't personally affected. I'd heard about the flooding in Washington State, failed to extrapolate. (Parochial? The U.S. media? Naaaah, couldn't be...) <br> <br>Geez, first fires, then floods ... is BC expecting a plague of locusts next Spring? :0)</div>
