  OverKill]] fonts. This collection will be designed to go with most extra bold or
  black weight fonts, not just OverKill. I've researched other dingbat fonts and there
  is a lot of stuff that is useless (in my opinion). I wanted ask what dingbat glyphs
  other folks find useful and how they might be used. For instance, I saw a cool one
  the other day. On the side of a service van, there was a computer mouse at the front
  of the web address. I'm certain that it isn't new, I just hadn't noticed it.  \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJames\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

  body: "That's a interesting project: ultra-bold dingbats, I like it! :-)\r\nThe
    problem with dingbats, as I see it, is that is difficult to strike the right balance
    between specificity/specialisation (and, thus, usefulness) and a broader scope
    (thus a broader audience).\r\nOne thing I would find useful, for example, would
    be a set of dingbats that can be used to mark the different entries of a business
    card/contact form (address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail, etc.).\r\nI
    noticed also that often dingbats in the same collection have a difficult time
    sharing a common distinctive style."
