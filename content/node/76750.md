body: "In a way, this is an InDesign post. My only excuse for posting here is there
  may be some implications for OT features. And that a bunch of you have greater skill
  writing regular expressions . . .\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nIt always bothers me when
  full caps aren't letterspaced, or are set with old style figures. The latter can
  happen with newspaper section page references (e.g., C2), U.S. Interstate highways
  (e.g., I-85), and other things (e.g., Box 42A) etc. -- usually in notes/references/bibliographies.\r\n\r\nSome
  would say just set the full caps as small caps. Well, finding them is still a chore,
  and some publishers prohibit small caps in backmatter (notes, references). This
  isn't as bad an idea as some might think. Additionally, some construction, (e.g.,
  Interstate I-15) don't work well with small caps & o.s. figs.\r\n\r\nFor my purposes,
  it's enough that some publishers banish small caps in the backmatter, though I hope
  I've shown there are other reasons for an automated solution. And there is the matter
  of letterspacing full caps, just like small caps.\r\n\r\nNow with InDesign, a grep
  style could do this. Problem is how to write it. At fist glance, it would seem that
  anything within word boundaries that doesn't have a lower case letter would qualify.
  But no, straight numbers would then qualify, and that's no good. What's needed is\r\n\r\n1.
  There must be at least two letters.\r\n\r\n2. There must be at least one cap.\r\n\r\n3.
  There can be no lowercase letters.\r\n\r\n4. At least some punctuation should be
  allowed -- period, hyphen, slash, quotes, maybe parens and brackets . . .\r\n\r\n5.
  Numbers should be included.\r\n\r\nYou cannot assume that a cap starts the string.
  It would also be nice if, say, US$100 did not qualify.\r\n\r\nAnybody think of other
  inclusions/restrictions?\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAs I envision a grep style rather than
  a grep search, one could use more than expression.\r\n\r\nSince you'd be calling
  a character style, everything could be hand-coded there -- letterspacing and figure
  style being primary. But if *cpsp* and *case* were adequate in the font, a lot of
  niceties would come along for free."

  body: "Ah, the wonders of GREP styles -- how did I ever work without them?\r\n\r\nLet's
    see -- the following GREP style will find any run of the following characters,
    with at least two uppercase characters anywhere (not consecutively): Capitals,
    digits, hyphen, period, open and close single and double curly quotes, and round
    parentheses.\r\n\r\nIt will match \"123A456B\" but not \"(...A1...)\" (only one
    capital); 'word' delimiters are all possible kinds of white space, plus begin/end
    of string.\r\n\r\nIt works like this: to the left of the starting point there
    should not be NOT a space (I cannot use the regular \\b boundary here, because
    it seems some non-whitespace characters also define a word boundary; in addition,
    I cannot use \"to the left <em>should be</em> white space, because then it will
    fail at the start of a paragraph). Then, from the start, there should be any number
    of allowed characters, excluding uppercase, followed by an uppercase, followed
    by again any number of allowed characters and again at least a single uppercase.
    That's to fulfill the requirement \"1. There must be at least two letters\" (which,
    incidentally, is repeated in \"2. At least one cap\" and \"3. No lowercase letters\").
    If the previous check matches, all characters are allowed up to NOT a non-space
    at the right.\r\n\r\n<code>(?&lt;!\\S)(?=[\\d\\-\\./~[~{~}~]()]*\\u[\\d\\-\\./~{~[~]~}()]*\\u)[\\u\\d\\-\\./~{~[~]~}()]+(?!\\S)</code>\r\n\r\n\r\nTo
    test, you can set up a character style with a fat colored underline, so you can
    see what it picks up and what gets ignored:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grepstyle_3612.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    great thing about GREP styles in InDesign is that they are entirely <em>live</em>,
    so you can type text and see the result immediately!"

  body: "Hi Theunis.\r\n\r\nNice. I screwed up the spec. (1) should read \"there should
    be at least two *characters*,\" not two *letters.* That way, A1 would qualify,
    but a single cap -- I, A, O -- wouldn't. And (2) wouldn't be redundant . . .\r\n\r\nBTW,
    do you think this useful? OK to say no."

  body: "Okay ... this needs a slightly different approach, then:\r\n\r\n<code>(?&lt;!\\S)(?=\\S*\\u)([\\u\\d~[~]~{~}.()]){2,}(?![^\\s[:punct:]])</code>\r\n\r\nThis
    needs at least a sequence of non-spaces followed by an uppercase (the (?=\\S*\\u)
    part), then the same characters as above may get repeated, at least two times
    and as much as possible.\r\n\r\nI also changed the \"end\" condition slightly.
    Rather than a space character -- or, as I said before, \"not <em>not</em> a space
    character --, it also needs to check for regular punctuation. My previous try
    also failed on \"... A1, ..\" (a single comma right after a 'good' expression).\r\n\r\n<cite>BTW,
    do you think this useful? OK to say no.</cite>\r\n\r\n\"Jugdement call. Ask a
    real human.\" (Quoted freely from -- I think -- a Terry Pratchett novel.)\r\n\r\nAs
    you can see with a highlight style applied, it picks up everything mildly applicably
    and <em>relentlessly</em>. GREP Styles are the Terminators of InDesign -- They
    Will Not Stop. You cannot manually override a GREP style, unless you make another
    one with every attribute set to the exact opposite. The Highlight style, for example,
    needs one with Underline forcibly switched Off. Worse is that you have to apply
    them manually as well.\r\n\r\nI'd have to see a run of the text you intend to
    apply it to, because it may well be it works as intended ... So <em>do</em> try
    out with a Highlighting Style, so at least you can see where it gets applied.\r\n\r\nHere's
    one I missed so far: since it also includes the parentheses, the closing ones
    in your short list of examples get picked up. It's virtually impossible to force
    \"matching parentheses\" in a GREP style ...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grepstyle2_4003.png]"
