  body: That would be Sergeant Garcia, my favorite character on the old Zorro TV show.
    When all the other soldiers were tearing around chasing Zorro, they'd find Sergeant
    Garcia in the back room with a big mug of wine and a <em>senorita</em> on his
    knee.

    It would have driven me crazy.\r\n\r\nI often wondered if they based the Sgt.
    Shultz character in Hogan's Heroes on Sgt. Garcia.\r\n\r\nMichael"
