  body: "Thought one of the font detectives who are aces on scripts would have found
    a match by now.\r\nI note the swash variations of the final letters, so this might
    be from a \"pro\" font with alternates.\r\nIf nothing turns up you could consider
    substitutes such as Mayfair http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/mayfair/ or
    Ballantines Script http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/ballantines-script/\r\nAs for
    the text it reminds me of designs by F.W. Goudy, or ATF circa 1910, particularly
    the leg on the R. See for example Goudy Bookletter 1911 http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Goudy+Bookletter+1911&q=Go
    LTC Village http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-village-no-2/ and Village
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/village/ Worth digging further.\r\nDon"

    it's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/samantha-upright-script|Samantha

  body: "Hi Ryuk, I can't see any mismatch with Poor Richard, it even has the spiked
    G shown in the image. So the invitation must be Poor Richard or another font based
    on the Keystone Foundry original. AFAIK there is no other digitization of it.\r\ndon"

  body: "Poor Richard is the name used by the Keystone Typefoundry for the Roman typeface
    when it was issued in 1919. It did not survive when Keystone merged with ATF that
    year. [Source: McGrew _American Metal Typefaces.._ p 255.] Luc Devroye makes one
    of his rare errors when he says that Poor Richard is based on Keystone's Benjamin
    Franklin. But that font is much heavier and with completely different letter-forms.
    The most similar font of the era is ATF's Parsons.\r\nI checked the Red Rooster
    and Phils versions against the original and find that they seem to have caught
    the details of the design. The Phils has relatively larger capitals, compared
    to the lower case,  than the Red Rooster. I have not checked the Beatty.\r\nDon"
