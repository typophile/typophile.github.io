<p>The fact that most of the “specially designed for those with disabilities” fonts look like crap to people with any taste at all in typography is a form of stigmatization.</p>
<p>It’s a primitive situation, akin to that which used to exist in many countries with invalid carriages, as they were then known. Of course, those vehicles were well meant and fairly useful, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motability">Motability</a> (in the UK from the late 1970s) is a better idea.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>As I understand the issue raised by David’s question: Is dyslexia a speciﬁc condition, a variety of specific conditions, or a pathologization of those on the low end of the reading ﬂuency bell curve? And what are the implications of these different categories for type design?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure. Because &ldquo;people with any taste at all in typography&rdquo; are probably <em>more</em> of a stigmatized minority! They&rsquo;re seen as snobs. And what I suspect actually ends up happening is that most people think these freakish fonts are &ldquo;cool&rdquo;, and that makes dyslexics feel like they&rsquo;re getting some cool special attention!</p>

<p>Hobo came close, but was missing some essential features.</p>
<p>EDIT: I&rsquo;ve found another one, this one from Mergenthaler Linotype. Oscar - but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been digitized. This only has the feature that b and d, p and q are distinctive, and not features to address other forms of dyslexia; but it is at least not too horribly violent a departure from a conventional typeface.</p>

<p>I ﬁnd that hard to believe, certainly within the font-licensing marketplace and amongst professional designers. And such designers must surely resent having to cock up their layouts with clunky fonts, and will likely not care too much about the end result, which is indeed stigmatization.</p>
<p><em>… most people think these freakish fonts are &ldquo;cool&rdquo;, and that makes dyslexics feel like they&rsquo;re getting some cool special attention!</em></p>
<p>That may be true amongst the targeted users, but I’m not so sure that the effect of such fonts in use, as seen by normal readers, will seen as cool, because (a) designers will be using them in a desultory manner, not creating their best and most stylish work, and (b) they’re ugly and geeky (in its original meaning), like the “invalid carriage” depicted above.</p>
<p>Don’t dyslexic readers too see them as ugly, quite apart from their functionality in immersive reading?
Or does being dyslexic mean that one has no sense of aesthetics?!</p>
<p>I don’t have anything against the immersive-reading functionality behind these fonts, if indeed, that can be proven to be meaningful, but the lack of polish in their drawing so far is detrimental to their use in a broader context.</p>

<p>David,
Are you asking the research community to go back and look at already completed studies concerning dyslexia and apply their findings then to what is now a much larger number of possible typefaces?
If a study indicated that a certain feature of a font&rsquo;s design seemed to help dyslexics somewhat from a possible sample of 500 fonts to choose from, then adding a subset of say 1,000,000 fonts which may have that same or similar feature?  The odds are more fonts with said feature are available now than there used to be kind of logic?</p>
