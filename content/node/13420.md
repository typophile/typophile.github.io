    [[Doyald Young]], who taught about letter forms and logos there for \r\nmany years
    tells the story in his <a href=\"http://www.delphipress.com/\">Fonts  and Logos</a>
    that his \r\nfirst lesson in drawing letters was [[Caslon]]. At the time he started,
    I \r\nwould guess Caslon was probably the most used typeface in books. I \r\nbelieve
    he continued the practice. So you are receiving a tradition. \r\n\r\nHistorically,
    probably [[Garamond]] should be the one, as it really seems \r\nto be the architype
    of printed letters following it. \r\n\r\nCaslon has through the centuries been
    probably the most widely used \r\ntypeface for the English language, but also
    controversial. Some say \r\nit is a collection of mistakes, and others that it
    has a great \r\nharmony and readability as a whole. Perhaps the controversies
    over it \r\nmake it still a good place to start. "

  body: "I was thoroughly interested in this question, Tina, so I did a little bit
    of digging through my type books. I wanted to know more about the reason too!
    I came up with much the same information that William posted \u2014 and a little
    bit more. I thought I would share this with you, in case you were interested,
    too.:\r\n\r\n\"Despite the many hundreds of text faces designed since 1460, the
    original old style faces (Garamond, Plantin, Janson, Caslon, etc.) are still considered
    to be among the most readable ever designed and therefore, are commonly used in
    publications where an abundance of continuous text is necessary. The essential
    humanistic qualities of this type style (a sense of rhythm, strong horizontal
    stress, with a flowing, easy interaction between characters) are commonly strived
    for in contemporary typeface design even, occasionally, in sans serif.\"\r\n\u2014
    taken from [[David Jury|David Jury's]] [[About Face: Reviving the rules of typography]]\r\n\r\n[[D.B.
    Updike]] explains the popularity of Caslon's type thus: \"While Caslon modelled
    his letters on Dutch types, they were much better; for he introduced into his
    fonts a quality of interest, a variety of design, and a delicacy of modelling,
    which few Dutch types possessed. Dutch fonts were monotonous, but Caslon's fonts
    were not so. His letters, when analyzed, especially in the smaller sizes, are
    not perfect, individually; but in mass their effect is agreeable\". Caslon does
    not have the elegance of Garamond's letters but their 'defects' are recognized
    as being typically Anglo-Saxon and as such have come to represent perfectly the
    sturdy English tradition in typography.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    point in [[Printing Types]], he goes so far as to criticize a \"stingy little
    Dutch type,\" one which later in the book is correctly identified as the work
    of Frenchman [[Robert Granjon]], where it is summarily praised. Updike's books
    are very useful, but I wouldn't look to them for objectivity.\r\n\r\nTina, what
    does your Caslon assignment consist of?"

  body: "Oz Cooper's comment on Caslon was along the lines of \"If Caslon had 'improved'
    his types as much as others have subsequently, it's doubtful it would still be
    around to be improved upon.\" \r\n\r\nCooper didn't like types that are ruthlessly
    methodical and clean. Not a big Bodoni fan.\r\n\r\nSo, from your point of view,
    it would probably be more straightforward to render a Didone, but perhaps the
    idea is that there's more to learn from something that's not so predictable. Also,
    it has a trace of the angled pen, which is interesting.\r\n\r\nIf you're lettering
    it by hand, it's probably quite forgiving, so not a bad place to start.\r\n"

    And he had <strong>too much</strong> praise for Spanish type. On the other hand,
    anybody who's been to Spain might excuse that.  :-)\r\n\r\nIn the case of Caslon,
    frankly I think that to some degree at least sloppiness has been mistaken for
    creative flair. A certain \"warmth\" in the forms is great (everybody knows I'm
    not exactly the biggest fan of Bodoni...) but there's a difference between that
    and just not caring for consistency, which can only harm the unity of the design.
    Which is not to say that such consistency should preclude good craft - and to
    me the high point of Caslon is in fact the tricks he pulls in the Italic UC \"Q\":\r\n\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/caslon_q.gif\r\n\r\nNot
    only is it non-linear, there's even topological variance, all brilliantly done.
    But of course this type of thing is too sophisticated to teach in a first course!

    it is being drawn. In other words, the act of pencil to paper and studying letterforms
    and learning how the white interacts with the black or how the stem interacts
    with the bowl. Choosing Caslon could be safe and boring, but I think the point
    is too learn how to draw letters.

    was, so they say, the one old-style face that survived being melted down in the

  body: "William's post above is an important one -- the midcentury revival of Caslon's
    types by Pickering (and others) had a profound influence upon book typography,
    and set the stage for the revivals of the next century. I don't know that we'd
    have seen William Morris' humanist revivals, let alone the work of Morison or
    Benton or Griffith, had it not been for the renewed interested in Caslon.\r\n\r\nCaslon
    was in sufficient use for the next hundred years that the \"Caslon\" name underwent
    the usual dilution in the marketplace. Every American foundry that had a Caslon
    type that bore some resemblence to the types of William Caslon had a greater number
    of \"Caslon\" types that didn't -- \"Caslon Antique\" and \"Caslon Open\" are
    two that survive today, real canards that have nothing to do with any of the Caslons.
    The 1923 ATF book is full of antiques (!) and moderns (!!) named \"Caslon.\"\r\n\r\nIt's
    possible that anyone picking Caslon for a freshman assignment is doing so because
    thirty years ago, it was one of the designs most readily accessible in a variety
    of media (from Presstype to Linotronic output.) If the next generation of typography
    teachers chooses Times Roman, it might be for similar reasons."
