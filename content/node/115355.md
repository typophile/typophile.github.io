    was manufactured for use on a building. I would suppose an alphabet was designed
    and letters were cast or cut from that template. The most similar lettering I
    could find as a digital font was [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/grand-central/?refby=bowfin|Grand
    Central]] by Tobias Frere-Jones for Font Bureau. It is based on lettering from
    the mid-1800's.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hey Mike,\r\n\r\nI was thinking the same for the \"all bets are off\" scenario
    with this stuff. If I had access to a scissor lift and was able to get up and
    get rubbings of the type, I'd work off of that and attempt a redraw myself, but
    that's not possible unfortunately, thus the reason I'm trying to find a digital
    version that at least captures the spirit of that type and time.\r\n\r\nMany thanks
    for your response!\r\n\r\n-Andrei"

    you shrank the images, or at least cropped them down. These were so big that my
    computer had to spin the rainbow ball just to let me scroll down the page.\r\n\r\nI
    think in addition to Grand Central that I suggested, you could search for serif
    titling fonts and maybe find others with a similar classic look.\r\n\r\n- Mike

      context pointer - lesson learned! I corrected the initial images up top so they're
      not as huge. Many thanks for taking the time to explain that and make suggestions

    with Aviano, which has about the right width. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano/\r\nI
    recommend you examine the Trajan Alternatives at Typecache http://typecache.com/font-clusters/07/
    for a good assortment of candidates to use as a basis for replicating the letters.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n"
