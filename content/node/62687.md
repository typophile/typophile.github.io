body: "can anyone ID the fonts in the pictures? sorry about the low res quality.\r\n\r\ni
  am currently working on a brochure for a new ferry company and have been taking
  inspiration from maps, charts and navigation equip. i am looking to make it clean
  with a hint of maritime flavor. i love the old vintage maps however i am trying
  to make the brochure more modern and relevant hence the search for a more contemporary
  typeface.\r\n\r\ni have been experimenting with frutiger for the body text but if
  anyone can suggest other types of fonts similiar to the one in the photo or perhaps
  something newer please share.\r\n\r\nmany thanx in advance for ur time and advice!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
