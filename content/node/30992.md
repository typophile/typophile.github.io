body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for an information design typeface, and
  I'm hoping you can recommend some. It will be used to produce big,complicated, technical
  documents for an architectural practice. So far, I've been using what's available
  to me, which is various weights of Bt Swiss (their in-house face ... I know ...
  ) for headers and titles, and verdana for a lot of the nitty gritty stuff. (Verdana
  works surprisingly well as a text face at about six or seven point. The numerals
  are great.) \r\n\r\nWhat I'd like is something that's a bit more elegant than verdana,
  that stands up to being used big. Or, something like helvetica, but more suitable
  for text, with robust numerals. It would also be nice if it was Opentype, so it
  can be installed on my work pc and my home mac, but this isn't vital. It would be
  nice to have a good selection of weights, from a light to a black or even ultra.It
  should preferably have a cool, geometric atmosphere, rather than a humanist one.
  \r\n\r\nSo far I've looked at FF Unit and FF Zwo, which are both really nice, but
  Unit is rather loosely spaced for my taste, and Zwo isn't available in Opentype.Are
  there any other faces that do what I'm after? "
