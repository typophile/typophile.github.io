body: We have one client that primarily uses Gill Sans for their type. The problem
  with it is that with certain letter combinations, the spacing gets pretty far off.
  Ideally we would have a custom made font with custom letter pair spacing, but I
  don't really know how to do that. The biggest issue is with a period followed by
  letters like V, W and T. So ". V" or ". T" They tend to run very tight, and we have
  to manually go in and add spacing. It mostly an issue in InDesign, and it doesn't
  really matter if the character spacing is Optical or Metric. Anyone deal with this?
  Whats the best solution?

  body: "The best solution is to prepare your own kerning. I believe there are plug-in
    programs that lets you write pairs for InDesign. Here is one:\r\n\r\nhttp://indesign.pluginsworld.com/plugins/adobe/287/knowbody-aps/knowbody-cool-kerning.html\r\n\r\nIt
    may not be as useful as one would like, see:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/7608\r\n\r\nThe
    other way is to go into the font itself and modify the kerning. I believe the
    Monotype/Linotype conglomerate's EULA prohibits that, at least if you're using
    OpenType. Practically, speaking, how would anyone know if it were done in the
    font, or done outside it?"

    I'd certainly could find a use for them."
