    to post font ID requests. If an admin can move it to wherever allowed... Thank
    you!

  body: "That is an unusual face and probably would make a nice revival if enough
    resource material is available. I do believe it is hand-set rather than by machine.
    \r\n\r\nI looked through my foreign foundry specimens (French and British) but
    cannot locate it, nor in the US foundries either. I'm uncertain as to where a
    Romanian book publisher of that era would go for type, perhaps a Russian foundry.
    Unfortunately I cannot find a Russian foundry specimen book.\r\n\r\nIf you do
    identify it, please post the name here for our information. In the meantime I
    will keep it on my list of to-be-identifieds."

    the [[http://www.stormtype.com/family-tusar.html|Tusar]] that he offers. (It isn't
    the same face, it just has some of that flavor.)"

    the book was printed in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, in a german typography,
    in present day Romania (right on the Romanian-Hungarian border).\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help! I'll keep searching myself..."

    You have to do this by yourself. Your sample has some good earmark letters --
    such as the A,  f and e --  that might trigger some digging. If you have more
    text, particularly if it has letters such as R, K, G, M, Q and W, it would be
    helpful if you included that in your post.\r\nDon"
