  New York Review of Books, e.g.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product-file/31/thes7931/product.jpg]]\r\n[[http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product-file/22/bewa5422/product.jpg]]\r\n\r\nIt's
  a recent sans (looks post-1980s, if not later), but I don't know those fonts well
  enough."

  body: "All-caps sans are really hard to ID (for me). In these samples the earmarks
    I noted were: splayed M (vertices not pointed), J below baseline, no serifs on
    I or J, W like two V's joined, G has a jaw, but no beard, R has straight leg starting
    on bowl (not stem).\r\n\r\nOne font I found that meets all these is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheque/jigsaw/|Jigsaw]]
    from Typotheque, designed in 1999. There must be others.\r\n\r\nWhen were your
    books published?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    many more examples, which may help narrow this down, here: http://www.nybooks.com/nyrb/\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the suggestions so far. I will check Meta."

  body: 'I think it''s Meta. There is lower case on the back cover (which you can
    using Amazon''s "Inside This Book" feature: http://www.amazon.com/Summer-Book-Review-Books-Classics/dp/159017268X/)
    and the lower-case g clinches it.'

    have lower case too, then the case is closed.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Well done! the cover font is indeed Meta. We're looking into upgrading to
    the opentype version of Meta now that we've started using InDesign. Does anyone
    have any opinions/advice/comments about it?
