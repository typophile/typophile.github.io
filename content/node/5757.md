body: This is my first post. I&#39;m doing a logo for a drip irrigation company in
  Sydney and this is what i&#39;ve done so far. They specialize in irrigation for
  plants not for lawns. There&#39;s next to no budget which i think many can identify
  with, and it well end up being used on business cards, Letterheads etc. Basically
  i&#39;m after your critique <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41354.jpg"

  body: Hi glenn <BR> <BR>i am not usually a fan of a &#34;photographic logo&#34;,
    it always carries a lot of printing dificulties. The leaf concept i like it a
    lot but i always value more a simplification of it. try working on a simpler version.  <BR>
    <BR>Drip Irrigation SYSTEM works for me, try puting the green of SYSTEM a little
    bit darker. <BR> <BR>good luck <BR> <BR>CG

    <BR> <BR>I kind of agree with this, allthough sometimes a logo results in a more
    complex form, i think  a logo should be a form easily to draw with a bad pencil
    in a napkin. <BR> <BR>think about it <BR> <BR>CG

  body: As Christian has suggested, simplify the graphic. Lose the gradients, maybe
    create some positive/negative play to create the leaf, etc
