  invitations as a gift to my brother. I never really have to deal with the printing
  part of my design work, and I'm wondering if anyone here from Toronto can list some
  locations for me to check out?\r\n\r\nI'm going to need to select a printer and
  provide paper samples to the bride soon. So, on that note... ANY help or suggestions
  would be greatly appreciated! \r\n\r\nThanks."

    bigger than you are comfortable dealing with. There used to be a good small shop
    on Railway Ave in Don Mills called Trade Offset (or something similar) that was
    next door to the type house I worked at.\r\n\r\nMost Canadian wedding invites
    are mass produced in a shop in Stratford. I don't think they are set to do much
    custom work, although if you can live with one of their catalog formats, you can
    save a bundle. (But that sucks for a designer).\r\n\r\nWish I could think of more
    names, but it has been a long time since I left Toronto."
