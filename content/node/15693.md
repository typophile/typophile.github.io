  \r\nThe only one I can find is for Volta Medium, but I'm using the Regular weight.\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/berlidin/\">Berlidin</a> is very similar,
  but doesn't have any italics at all...\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThanks.\r\n"

    but I wish  these other types had the same \"softness\" that I see in Volta and
    Berlidin. Is there a better (technical) term for that?\r\n\r\n"
