  Zero ok?  I was born in 1980... so that's why I'm using Eight Zero as my name.  Thanks...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_treatment_ez_post_3553.jpg]

  body: 'John, this is some lovely swash action. It reads for me. I''d suggest not
    using the white hairlines to define edges. I like the beginning EIG more because
    of it. The backside of the cross-stroke on T seems a little thin, maybe should
    be closer to the front side of the cross-stroke on the H? The tail on the r seems
    a little horsey and the finial too sharp. You have a (sort of ) ball terminal
    on the cross-stroke on the EIG, but then you use sharp on the second E and the
    R and O. Not that combining both is bad, but maybe you need to decide how and
    where those are used a little bit more? '
