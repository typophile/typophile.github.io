  letter form is identical and the set type looks to regular. Given that Opentype
  allows for thousands of characters is there a way that multiple versions of each
  letterform could be used in a font (imagine 5 verions of lowercase 'm') with the
  computer then randomly selecting one of them (each time the 'm' key is pressed)?\r\n\r\nI
  imagine this would involve assigning one 'm' shape to the correct unicode character
  and the other four to 'empty' codes, and then having the computer somehow alternate
  between them...?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nAaron"

  body: "Yes, it's possible. And technically you off to a good start. And it might
    be a good idea to persue *if* the design is made in such a way that it benefits
    from the randomness. Before Opentype a type 1 font called Kosmik was made by Letterror
    that does. See?\r\nhttp://www.letterror.com/foundry/kosmik/index.html\r\n\r\nBut
    about the hand lettering. Good hand made letters (and therefore words - no?) are
    made with their forms in relationship with each other - not randomly. So making
    a type face with context driven substitution might make more sense.\r\n\r\nThere
    are lots of threads on Typophile that talk about these issues. Take advantage
    of them by searching Typophile. Cheers!"
