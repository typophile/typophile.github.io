  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am involved with a small group of Freethinkers in Fort Wayne, Indiana that want to eventually incorporate, and an trying to help spiffy up their design. Although I like to think I&rsquo;m pretty good with typography, logo developing isn&rsquo;t really my thing, so I figured this is a great place to gather some ideas.</p>
<p>In case you don&rsquo;t know, the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought|Freethought movement]] is to promote critical thinking, science, and logic, and reject dogma, superstition. Things like pro-science, evolution, positive atheism, and secular humanism go hand-in-hand with our group, which as you can imagine is often a touchy subject, considering we&rsquo;re in conservative Indiana.</p>
<p>Attached is our current logo designed by an enthusiastic founding member, which is more of just a stylized wordmark. It&rsquo;s nice, but it doesn&rsquo;t really have anything to do with freethinking, or any of the above points I was talking about. I&rsquo;ve included a few other concepts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about trying to use a graphic of a brain, or a head in there somewhere. Something that implies thinking. Basically, I need something punchy, simple, and looks good in B&amp;W and color as well (with only a couple colors, maybe blue and black?) If we could incorporate our tagline, &ldquo;Be Reasonable.&rdquo;, it would be better all the more.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas, heavily inspired by a couple awesome iStockphoto graphics.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_concepts_5518.jpg]</p>
<p>Any ideas, concerns, brainstorms? Thank you for your time, and I love this forum. It&rsquo;s always a wellspring of good, constructive criticism!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I imagine it really depends on how you are positioning the group and who you want to target.</p>
<p>To attract fellow freethinkers, I think a logo more in the style of your avatar would make more sense&hellip;maybe something with a bit of humour. A head with the top sliced off and a funnel.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the target is the community at-large, then I think you probably need a more conservative/straight-forward type treatment with perhaps a more abstract symbol.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think #1 is a strong concept and a great use of space. 2 is really good, but I worry that people might think someone botched a gradient, using two fewer steps in the blend might work better. 3 is cool but won’t scale well without multiple versions or manual intervention, so save it for a t-shirt. 4 feels like a throw-away.</p>
<p>Across the board:
•The caps are tracked much too tight, and will look better in a lighter weight.
•Capitalize “Fort Wayne”. Proper nouns in sans-serif lowercase feels very dated.
•Do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> incorporate your tagline into your logo. A tagline is a tagline, a logo is a logo. If you want to use them together that’s fine, but you’ll get better results by leaving the tagline out of the logo and treating it as a separate entity.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Boy, you really get around, Andy!  This is the second time I&rsquo;ve stumbled upon you.</p>
<p>Thanks for calling my logo nice.  I hadn&rsquo;t figured out what image to put with it.  It was intended for simple recognition by anyone, and to be easily reducible.  I was hoping to add something along the lines of what you were thinking or just making a completely new one.</p>
<p>I talked with the other Andy and he said we are welcome over there any time to work on developing a new logo.  We just need to get together to brainstorm and pound out a few more ideas.</p>
<p>I like your way of thinking though.  Forums like this one are full of great ideas and good suggestions:</p>
<p>James Puckett had a good suggestion concerning keeping our logo separate from our tag-line.</p>
<p>aluminum&rsquo;s idea of a sliced head with a funnel sounds interesting.  We might have to play around with that one a little bit.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help everyone!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with James, about the type treatment. The whole lightbulb in the head thing is rather overused, and doesn&rsquo;t necessarily promote free thought, but an realization. Why is Free Thought one word? If it&rsquo;s a movement then shouldn&rsquo;t there be some sort of community aspect brought into the logo? I think number 4 is probably the closest out of the samples to express that, but I agree, it&rsquo;s more an electrical based theme.</p>
<p>For some reason, a 50&rsquo;s style mind control type of image came to mind.</p>
