body: Hi! <BR> <BR>So i&#39;m risking my head on this chopping block. I am submitting
  the new identity for our Design firm. It&#39;s a new company, a subsidiary from
  another. We&#39;re situated in Montreal, so it&#39;s in french. So those who don&#39;t
  understand, on the first image, the official logo is at the bottom, and the others
  above are variations for the differents services. By lack of time, we didn&#39;t
  create the typography for the logo.  <BR>And on the other image, it is the business
  card, for the 3 associates. The format of the card is credit card size.  <BR> <BR>So
  tell me what you think.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/66310.jpg"

  body: I like the type by itself. The bracketed character seems to just distract
    from the logotype. It also seems a bit cliche &#40;ie, bitmapped type for interactive...way
    overdone...&#41; <BR> <BR>If anything, I&#39;d stick with the &#39;ae&#39; or
    just get rid of it all together. Let the logotype do the talking.

  body: I like the idea of the different marks for different divisions, but it seems
    like a lot of marks for one group. Will they be used separately that much? I agree
    with darrel that they&#39;d all probably work without the extra marks. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    if you do need/want the variations, then you should make them either more distinct
    from each other or more uniform. At a glance, &#39;mouvement&#39; and &#39;interactif&#39;
    are very different from the others, which all read as nearly the same. Also, the
    &#39;m&#39; is so different that it feels out of place. It&#39;s so strong and
    stylized that it overpowers the words. But on the other logos, the letters are
    much simpler and don&#39;t add much. <BR> <BR>I think you should either make the
    bracketed letters all very strong, or all the same as the logotype, or just remove
    them altogether.

  body: ok .. thanks for the comments  <BR> <BR>in fact, the different variations
    were more to value the evolution capabilities of the original logo &#40;the &#34;AE&#34;&#41;
    They are not to be used unilateraly. We didn&#39;t work as much on the different
    variations, but i like the possibility that an original logo can be developped
    into other long term possibilities... maybe I shouldn&#39;t have posted them first  <BR>
    <BR>The brackets were added to stylise the too straight and boring lines of type.
    It sort of humanises it. By the way, the type is Interstate. But i&#39;ll try
    other possibilities besides the brackets.

  body: Are you familiar with the US clothing retailer American Eagle? They can be
    found at <a href="http://www.ae.com" target="_blank">www.ae.com</a>  Although
    I don&#39;t see the mark on their site, they have very frequently used an &#34;ae&#34;
    mark very similar to the gestalt you posted. I think combining an &#34;a&#34;
    and an &#34;e&#34; like this is fairly common. I even did it myself once for a
    company named &#34;Peak&#34;. So, even if your &#34;ae&#34; mark doesn&#39;t infringe
    upon anyone elses, I&#39;d suggest creating something more original.

  body: Alessandro_  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s no alibi, it really makes that text real dynamic.
    I like the contrast between the two expressif and posed graphic elements. The
    left alignment is part of the concept so I don&#39;t see the reason to move that
    around, if playing the accordeon is that what you mean.  <BR> <BR>Ty_ <BR> <BR>No
    i did not know that clothing retailer. But first of all, contexts of utilisability
    are to be understood to make parallels I think. Of course, using a type glyph
    will be an element somewhat of already seen. But making an image is more that
    a logo, so I don&#39;t really see a problem there. We are a design firm and no
    selling product company. We don&#39;t really bother of the simplicity and straight
    forwardness of the <a href="http://www.pentagram.com" target="_blank">www.pentagram.com</a>
    logo, and it is still one of the most respected design businesses in the world.

    so then it`s fine, I just don&#39;t see <BR>how those brackets can make your image.

  body: "Alter and Alessandro. I had to look to see _what_ you were on about. It seems
    to me it is just a little mis-communication. I like the curly-brackets and think
    that in most cases you, Alter, have used them to call attention to the most important
    bits. Used this way they aren&#39;t only decoration but do help segment and give
    hierarchy to the text.  <BR> <BR>My 2\xA2"

  body: I think what some of us are saying &#40;or at least what I&#39;m saying&#41;
    is your logotype is strong all by itself. The brackets and letter don&#39;t really
    add anything...but rather they just distract from the nice type.  <BR> <BR>I actually
    do like the business cards. Perhaps that&#39;s what you go with...just use one
    bracket as an ancillary element to the nice type logomark.

  body: Tiffany_  <BR> <BR>nice analysis; I have started to produce some prints for
    our company, and it has become an alignment reference. I find it interesting to
    have a graphic element to play with.. that can be expressif and serve as a simple
    alignment.  <BR> <BR>Furthermore, I never liked the idea of a fixed logo. I have
    used the type alone... and it was interesting, but in a contrast within a dynamic
    page. And the contrary with the brackets .. but in a sobre background. I don&#39;t
    think that a logo has to be integral, 100 % of the time.  <BR> <BR>Thanx for all
    the comments everyone.. it has helped grow our image concept!
