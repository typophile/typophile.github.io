  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This year, Sears brought back its old "Wish" catalog that was absent for 14 years, visiting a Sears store over the weekend I came across heavy promotion of their entire "wish" theme, there must have been close to a hundred red in-store signage boards with the word "wish" prominently in the center, inspiring the holiday spirit and nicely decorating everything throughout the store.

"wish" :) I could've made a picture of these posters for you to ID the font, so here is a banner I found online using the same script font.

The style reminds me very strongly of <a href="http://www.typesetit.com/index2.html">Rob Leuschke</a>'s work, and it's possible he did this lettering for Sears, since he does a lot of custom work.

While it it possible that the type is custom, it does seem fairly familiar.
Any other suggestions?

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Sam, 

I've been away from the Board for a few days, and just saw your post. There are roughly thirty of us looking at these posts at any given time, and if no one came up with other ideas this suggests more strongly that this is custom work.

I think you might see why I suggested <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Leuschke">Rob Leuschke's</a> work if you go to this link and type in 'Grant a Wish' as the test drive phrase. While the details of each font are not consistent with the Sears lettering, to me the lettering style seems to fit Rob's work. I know it's just a hunch, but I think it's a reasonable one. Sears certainly has the means to hire someone to letter three words for all their holiday marketing, I would think. This way no one duplicates your look exactly, but Leuschke's work is where I'd start to find something that you would perhaps mistake for it, if you didn't have them side-by-side.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Mike, 
I appreciate very much your research and effort to help out a fella typophile, contacting Rob Leuschke goes far beyond your duty and I'm thankful for that.

I must disagree with Rob's observation that it might be hand lettering, the two a's on the sample are not really different in my view (it's just different sizes), besides, seeing the typeface in the store I recall it being applied on various formats and on different messages (e.g. Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, etc.) and they were all consistent and uniform.

If it is indeed a custom type like you suggested, I was hoping that the creator might be a typophile who could share more info about it (aren't all custom font designers typophiles? I guess I need to get out of my bubble...)

My next move will be - since I'm so love stricken by this script - to go back to the Sears store with a digital camera and attempt to capture some nice shots of the signage without being caught by security... will let you know.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sam, I see your point about the 'a', and you could be right that it's a font, but that doesn't mean it's available, if it is a custom design made for Sears. We're all fanatics here, so asking the potential designer is one thing we might try to do if we're stuck. Now if someone knows the Sears Art Director, that might be another avenue to try.

I assume that work is a custom lettering (see the lig between "he" or the p and h endings, well... it could be opentype but I do not think so....anyway that was not done by us (we would like to have that kind of work). The tagline is Almond Script. </div>
