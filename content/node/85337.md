body: "Hey there, everyone!\r\n\r\n<em>Catorze27</em> is a typeface inspired by northern
  Portuguese modernist lettering.\r\n\r\nWrought iron is a widely used element on
  Portuguese architecture and, as such, the typeface started after collecting several
  photographs of modernist iron signage in several cities in the north of Portugal,
  specially in Espinho, Porto, Ponte de Lima and Viana do Castelo.\r\n\r\nAs a result,
  <em>Catorze27 / Style 1</em> is the first of 3 styles, featuring 570+ glyphs, 7
  weights, case-sensitive forms, 2 styles of numerals in 2 sizes, Greek (Monotonic),
  Cyrillic and supports most of the Latin Unicode ranges.\r\n\r\nAvailable from:\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fabio-martins/catorze27-style1/|MyFonts]]\r\n\r\nOther

  you in advance for your replies.\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/cover_BIG_0.png\"

  body: '@Riccard0: Thank you! Well, I live in Espinho, Portugal. Like New York, the
    city streets have numbers, not names. So, the first wrought iron pics I took were
    from door numbers in a house between the 14th and 27th street. :)'
