  body: I only asked for ~4 type books because I have no other material wants really
    this year, I suspect that I will be getting them and enjoying my new base of knowledge
    once finished reading them!

    for different reasons. Chris always has a humourous view of the world and Norbert
    is putting his effort into education. Good guys both. But hey I''m an older guy
    too and thats my perspective. Come on younger guys and gals: who are your heros
    this year! '

  body: "Hmmm yeah, I totally zoned out on the idea of the thread. My parents deserve
    an amazing gift for giving me the opportunity of living in Manhattan for 6 months
    on co-op. I just don't know what to get them...and money is pretty short since
    I don't get paid at work.\r\n\r\nI second your motion, Dan. These two guys are
    tip top in contributions to this community both intellectually and educationally."

  body: "Thank you Dan. I am truly humbled.  To me, the true heros who really deserve
    our praise are the ordinary folk who have very little of their own but still give
    what they can to those less fortunate. Some volunteer time at soup kitchens, others
    pass out blankets to the homeless who have nothing but a steaming grate to keep
    them warm. They don't get recognition for their work, they just do it because
    it is right.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
