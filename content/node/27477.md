  on each thread which read smoething  like: \"xxx page reads\" with the x's being
  the number of times that thread has been read. Recently, this tidbit of information
  has vanished. I found it interesting to see how many people had read a particular
  thread compared to the far smaller number who had posted to it. Has this been removed
  for a reason or is it just a glitch to be repaired?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    likely en-route to Boston! Maybe leaving the intern behind to reboot the Mac if
    the site goes down, safe in the knowledge that during TypeCon only a handful of
    people visit typophile.  "

    going to come. Who knows, one of use might make the top 10 posters list for a
    change."
