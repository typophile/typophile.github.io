  body: The italic is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/baby-mine-fat/baby-mine-thin-oblique/testdrive.html?s=emocoes%2Bunicas&amp;p=48">Baby
    Mine</a> &#40;which is the closest match I&#39;ve found for the logo so far&#41;..
    Could they have modified the fat cut of Baby Mine for the logo? <BR> <BR>Looking
    at the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/baby-mine-fat/baby-mine-plump/win-t1/126795/charmap.html?cpselect=CP2&amp;page=1">
    character map</a> it&#39;s possible.. The lc &#39;a&#39; might have come from
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/baby-mine-fat/baby-mine-plump/win-t1/126795/character/00E6/CP2/1/">
    this</a> glyph. Hm, too far-fetched?
