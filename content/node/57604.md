body: "Time and again the question about the \"oldest pixel font\" crops up. \r\nI
  went digging a bit.\r\n\r\nPixelated <em>lettering</em> sure is old. You get mosaics
  in ancient cultures. But what about fonts? I'm going to go out on a limb here and
  propose that embroidery alphabets published as specimens for embroiderers should
  be considered fonts rather than lettering. The grid-bound specimens effectively
  constitute patterns of rules and instructions to be executed (albeit by humans).\r\n\r\nGiven
  this definition (which is probably debatable), below are the oldest \"pixel fonts\"
  that I've been able to find so far. These two cross stitch alphabets were published
  in 1533. 476 years ago! Machiavelli's \"Prince\" had just been posthumously published,
  Luther's Bible was about to follow, Da Vinci had recently passed away, Michelangelo
  was alive and working, movable type was still a young technology, and the New York
  area had just been discovered by the Europeans.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/livre-nouveau-1533_6399.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/livre-nouveau-1533-2_6599.jpg]\r\nThese
  two alphabets were included in <em>Livre nouveau dict Patrons de lingerie,</em>
  edited by Pierre de Sainte-Lucie, published between 1530 and 1533. The alphabet
  of roman capitals (of which, unfortunately, I only have a cropped image) was apparently
  previously published, in a slightly differing form, in a book by a certain Sch\xF6nsperger
  in 1524. The author of the book I got this from (Catherine Pouchelon, <em>Ab\xE9c\xE9daires
  Brod\xE9s</em>) maintains that that was the first cross stitch alphabet ever to
  be published."

  body: "\"Gridded\" isn't bad. \r\n\r\n\"Pixelated\" (and I put that in quotation
    marks because it's only accurate in a sort of synecdocheal way), in terms of conforming
    to the same design limitations, structurally/morphologically, that pixelated screen
    type is bound to. (That was the short version.)\r\n\r\nI did a somewhat thorough
    analysis of the various structural types of what I have called \"Gef\xFCgte Zeichen\"
    in German, a couple of years ago*; in English I'm still missing a term for those,
    maybe \"composed/assembled signs\", basically meaning graphical signs that are
    built-up from individual smaller units (as opposed to the other methods of making
    signs as defined by Andreas St\xF6tzner, namely writing/drawing/etching; deforming
    material; or printing/punching/stamping).\r\n\r\nFrom what I know, cross stitch
    specimens show the oldest forms of thusly \"composed\" signs (at least with regard
    to lettershapes) that are also <em>bound to a compulsory, rectilinear/orthogonal
    grid divided into roughly square units</em>, *and* are not rasterized automatically,
    but <em>designed for that grid</em>. They share that with bitmap screen fonts,
    and that makes them especially interesting to compare to the latter. Of course
    variables such as absolute size, historical context, purpose, and of course the
    nature of the light-emitting screen vs. cloth, et al., impose practical limits
    on the transferability of designs. Nevertheless, especially at small sizes the
    morphological parallelisms can be stunning.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm incapable of not digressing
    wildly when dealing with this overall subject. :-}\r\n\r\n* http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=67"

    iffy... According to this <a href=\"http://www.foveon.com/files/ABriefHistoryofPixel2.pdf\">document</a>,
    the term was first used in 1965.\r\n\r\nBut the concept is clear: letterforms
    that fit into a grid. Grids <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Grid-Book-Hannah-B-Higgins/dp/0262512408/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1241480138&sr=1-1\">have
    existed for a long time</a>, so perhaps the term \"gridded\" is best. "

  body: "Yeah, I admit my use of \"pixel\" up top was mainly populist. :->\r\n\r\nActually,
    I'm not sure I'm happy with \"gridded\" as a term. That's probably because I have
    my German nomenclature in mind\u2026 I'd like to keep viewing these as a sub-form
    of all \"assembled\" characters (like in mosaics; lettering composed of wall,
    roof, or floor tiles; LEDs; dot matrix printers; pebbles on the beach; rhinestone
    ornaments on girly shirts; lettering out of coffee cups photographed from above
    [Sagmeister]; etc., you know, the whole story). So they can be <em>gridded assembled</em>
    characters, but not <em>just</em> gridded. Does that make sense?\r\n(Because,
    say, a glyph that's been automatically rasterized for on screen display is also
    gridded, but it's not consciously designed for that grid, so it wouldn't conform
    to my definition of an assembled character.)\r\nBTW, does this \"assembled\" work?
    Or is \"composed\" better?\r\n\r\nPaul, thanks for the link! I'll have to get
    that book. I like the fact that they seem to have ordered the alphabets by cap
    height. But note that their samples \"only\" go back to the 18th century."

    of marking can happen in either constrained and unconstrained fields with constructed
    or unconstructed marks, before one even gets to classifying how the marks and
    fields are addressed by the mark maker, or whether the resulting material is lettering
    or a font. But generally, unless this needlepoint type can be reused, I'd think
    of it as lettering. \r\n\r\nThanks for the ideas and Cheers!"
