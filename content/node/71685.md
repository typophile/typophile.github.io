body: I'm working on a business card project. The old card was offset with gold foil
  and green ink. I'm keeping the basic color scheme but I'd prefer to have it printed
  in letterpress. I just can't decide between metallic ink or foil stamp. I'm leading
  toward the metallic ink, the foil seems to shiney and bright but I'm concerned that
  metallic ink on cotton stock will be too dull. Has anyone used either method recently?
  What were your pros and cons?

  body: "If your card has gold foil stamping on it, the stamping was put on with a
    letterpress; there is no way to apply it with an offset press.\r\n\r\nMetallic
    ink will last longer (foil may flake and wear off over time), but it will be duller
    than foil."

  body: Metallic ink on uncoated stock tends to get absorbed by the paper and leaves
    a dull mottled effect. If you want it to look like metal on the paper, you probably
    ought to go with metal foil. Or at least that's been my experience with the two
    processes.

    site]] and I'd agree that it's duller, especially on uncoated stocks. We have
    a black uncoated paper and gold ink in particular almost disappears on it and
    really requires bold art.\r\n\r\nMetallic raised ink is also interesting. It looks
    sort of like glitter.\r\n"

    (running it through the press two or more times) will give you better coverage
    (but will cost more). "

    silver, looks absolutely ghastly on uncoated stock.\r\n\r\nIf you can, get a sample
    package from a local printer who specializes in special printing techniques."
