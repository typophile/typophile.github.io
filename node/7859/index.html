<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello again, getting the hang of this place now. <br> <br>My last thread was about typographic handling by students but now I want to look back a little at those who influence them. <br>Two famous names many students look to where radical typography is concerned are Why Not Associates and David Carson. Why Not still seem very much respected wheras Carson recieves strong criticism. Where then is the line between expressive typography and typography which is too irreverent? <br> <br>hope that makes sense <br>danielle</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I don't have much problem with "irreverent"; I have a problem with "illegible" and "unreadable." Those are the grounds on which most of the recent criticism of Carson seems to be based. <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>IMHO, Typography (and graphic design) must by all and any means communicate the intended message to the target audience. Beyond that, the world is open. <br>If you can enhance communication by decreasing legibility, then this is fair game. An example might be designing a poster for say an optometrist where the headline might say "Blurred Vision?" and you were to either use one of the "Blurred" fonts or distort the text in PhotoShop yourself. The technique does not of itself seal the deal. It has to be done well. This is true of all typographic design. You can follow every rule in Bringhist's book and still not make a good design. Text can be readable but not effective. To me, there is a difference between good typesetting and good typography. <br>The major problems come when someone tries to mimic a technique that he/she has seen used successfully but without having it help convey the message ("If you are not part of the solution then you are part of the problem"). This is what we used to call "Technique-ee" design. An absurd example might be to use the "Blurred" typeface we had successfully seen above in the vision poster and use it for a road sign because it was "cool type" or very "hip" or "in" but in the process destroyed communication. <br>The designers task is to solve the communication problem to the best of his/her ability. You can do this by pushing the envelope or staying safely inside the box. The key words are "solve communication problem"--this is always the measure. <br>You can argue the merits of Carson's work. Sometimes he was successful, sometimes not. It is tough doing a monthly magazine and hitting the mark every article every month. In his favor, his audience loved it even if many outside that group may not have. <br>To me Carson was always at least a very skilled typographic painter and at his best a good designer as well. The tough part about being famous is that everyone sees all of your work and you are open to criticism. The many of us who dwell in relative obscurity are not held up to the light for examination so readily and can choose just our best work to show our peers. <br> <br>ChrisL</div>

<div class=commentbody>Oh, what a nice thread, <br>For a some reason I didn't get the first <br>two posts, so, the first thing (I still have <br>to read all the posts) that came to my mind <br>was: what a nice topic, and, 'line' ? <br>maybe that is an area ? And the saying <br>'two leaps per chasm is fatal.' <br>I would like to write more, later. <br>AS</div>
