    ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJeremy"

  body: Somebody's been messing around. The "o" isn't "squooshed" and the "C" looks
    like it's from a different font--Cooper Oldstyle possibly. The "k" also has been
    modified or something. A real mess, but mostly Palatino.

    up. I just used Palatino for everything, with some adjusting."
