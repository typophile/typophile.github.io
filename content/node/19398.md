body: "Hello.\r\n\r\nI wonder if any one can help me. I have a bit of a typographic
  design problem.\r\nI have to lay out a design that is going to be carved onto Portland
  stone by a stonemason.\r\nHope the following makes sense. \r\nThere are blocks of
  portland stone. Please see image.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/panels.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  panels are marked Type A1.\r\nNames are going to be carved into the stone. \r\nThe
  first Type A1 column from the right is the first column to have names on. These
  people are more important. These will have two names on each panel within the column.
  The biggest sized font.\r\nThe second Type A1 column will have three names on each
  panel within the column. The medium sized font.\r\nThe third Type A1 column will
  have five names on each panel within the column. The smallest sized font. \r\nThis
  isn't the way I would have done it. I would have had the font size all the same!!\r\nBut
  no...\r\nAs you can see the layout of the stone panels makes a strong grid. I have
  decided because the strong grid and its a modern building that the text should be
  right aligned. Fine. \r\nNames might have to be added later on so this means that
  the names should be aligned to the top of the panel (theres a margin). OK. \r\nBut
  here is my biggest problem. Is it right to align the fonts of each of the three
  different type sizes to the top of the font rather than the baseline? If I align
  to the baseline there will be more of a gap at the top of the panel with the smallest
  font. What do you think I should do? Hope this all makes sense. This is giving me
  a headache!\r\n\r\nD.\r\n\r\n "

  body: "My take would be to align the baselines because they are the most constant
    element. I would also use the baseline grid set by the largest point size to use
    for the next two columns.\r\ne.g. (these are hypothetical sizes) 1st 24/30, 2nd
    18/36, 3rd 12/42 [point size/leading].\r\n\r\nWhat typeface are you using, is
    it being routed or carved?\r\n\r\n<em>These people are more important\u2026 The
    biggest sized font.</em> Clients you've got to love them (or bury them under a
    block of Portland stone)\r\n\r\nHope it all works out\r\nTim"
