  or if there is something similar that I can download to recreate something like
  it.

  body: The Type ID section on this site and two others did not help me, which is
    why I resorted to asking the community. I thought maybe it was hand lettering
    or a custom thing and thought I would see what others thought. Thanks any way.

    there.
