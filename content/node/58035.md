  one may use as a starting point for recreating Art Deco/Art Nouveau pub signage

  body: That is pretty good - thank you. I can modify that R to bring it closer to
    the rather distinctive character of the original. The M&B one above is proving
    difficult though. At the moment I'm toying with the idea of scanning an old Art
    Noavaux face (probably Jackson- thank you Dover!) and setting it 'by hand'.
