  \r\n\r\nThe cafeteria is in the basement of a museum, it's the cheapest of the three
  restaurants in the building. The cafeteria walls are dark kelly green. The logo
  needs to be simple and work well in vinyl... very simple lines. \r\n\r\nDoes the
  leaf make sense?\r\n\r\nHow about a fork and knife? (The illustration is problematic,
  I am not a great illustrator... any suggestions on how to improve the fork and knife
  illustration are welcome.)\r\n\r\nDo you like the type treatment?\r\n\r\nall feedback
  welcome....\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\nLeila[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leaves1_5053.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/forks_4683.jpg]"

  body: "I am not sure i like the ones with knife and fork. It is sort of already
    being in the word caf\xE9 (that you can expect a place where you can get something
    eat). Doesn't really give the Courtyard Caf\xE9 something special and unique,
    if you ask me. There is no reason to say the same thing twice.) The knife and
    fork is also the default pictogram, at least in my part of the world :))\r\n\r\nSo
    i like the leaf best alwell, but like Ratbaggy said of photo would be interesting.

  body: "Leila, the boxed designs aren't bad (I don't like the utensils designs for
    reasons others have mentioned), but the leaf designs feel very uninteresting.
    The earlier type treatment feels more consistent with the leaf (with the roundness
    of the forms) but I like the Perpetua because it feels like a decision was made
    to at least look a bit distinct. Though I work with Perpetua all day as part of
    my primary job's corporate ID, so I kind of <em>have</em> to like it. Either way,
    be aware of the forms of the type and the forms of the other visual elements,
    and how they interact.\r\n\r\nThe design could use some refinement overall. I
    guess my impression is that the decisions you made about the design don't feel
    like strong decisions. They feel more like defaults. I would expect this sign
    to be identifying that there's a cafe in the courtyard, not announcing the Courtyard
    Cafe. Does that make sense?\r\n\r\nPerhaps try to develop the stem of the leaf
    and let it flow more organically into the frame? Right now it's just sitting on
    it and the stem feels too fat to me. Also, the frame feels like a standard 1pt
    box with rounded corners. Try giving the words a touch more breathing space and
    experiment with different rule weights or even multiple rules. The box feels safe
    because it helps the logo to feel more solid, but is it necessary at all? This
    could free you to try the leaf merging into the bottom of the C in Cafe.\r\n\r\nI
    hope this helps."
