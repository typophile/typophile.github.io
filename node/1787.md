body: I&#39;m working on a logotype for a company whose name consists of 20 characters
  across three words. The client would like the design to be entirely horizontal &#40;without
  line breaks&#41;. It will need to work across a variety of media including web,
  signage, vehicles &#40;vans&#41;, clothing, and print &#40;mostly flyers &amp; brochures&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>My initial thought was that a heavy, black, or extra condensed sans face
  would be best due to the many characters &#40;22 with spaces&#41;. I&#39;m also
  leaning toward all caps and italics for reasons having to due with evenness &#40;type
  color&#41; and the brand&#39;s strong associations with movement/motion/activity.
  <BR> <BR>While I&#39;m able to see what looks good on screen and at 1200dpi from
  my B&amp;W laser, I&#39;m somewhat unsure about the implications of the aforementioned
  typographic choices when it comes to the other media I mentioned &#40;esp. signage
  &amp; vehicles&#41;. <BR> <BR>However, when I set the type in a gothic &#40;not
  condensed&#41; place it next to a black condensed sans and pump up the point size
  - my eye is definitely drawn to the gothic from way across the room. <BR> <BR>Hence,
  I leave my query with the Oracle at Typophile in hopes that I may be enlightened.

  body: Here&#39;s a rough rough. Obviously the Helvetica Neue 107 Cond Oblique gives
    you more height. What I&#39;m interested in discussing is how they&#39;ll perform
    at MUCH larger sizes &#40;see above&#41; <BR> <BR> t. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19197.gif"

  body: How much larger is &#34;much larger&#34;? <BR> <BR>1&#34; 2&#34; 3&#34; 4&#34;
    5&#34; 6&#34; 10&#34; ? <BR> <BR>The only real way to discover how they will perform
    at much larger sizes, is to make them at the target size and view them under target
    conditions.  <BR> <BR>Depending on the viewing distance of the target size, you
    may have to open up the letterspace. <BR> <BR>Also if we are talking about real
    distance viewing the C in both designs closes in on itself and is too close in
    shape to the O.

  body: One more thing, mixed cases will help with both the length and the readability.
    I don&#39;t feel that all caps adds anything to communicate speed that could not
    be achieved with mixed case. <BR> <BR>If its a matter of even color, you could
    redraw the caps to more closely balance the lowercase.

  body: One thought is to run the words together and change the middle words color
    or tint of solid color or change the weight of the middle word. Might also experiment
    with a condensed face if in all caps. You might also propose using the Initials
    of the Company as the logo and use the name small under them. Your example would
    be BCC large and Bike Cruiser Company small.

  body: You could test your photoshop skills by snapping some photos of signs &amp;
    vans &amp; dropping in your logo. Not as accurate as James&#39; method, but it&#39;s
    cheaper &amp; quicker &amp; it&#39;ll get you in the ballpark. A really long logo
    like that is difficult to work with; if nothing else, a photoshop demo will show
    your client what challenges you are up against if your logo has a 14:1 width-to-height
    ratio. <BR> <BR>You could also present your logo in 3 versions, printed matter,
    &#34;outdoor&#34; &amp; web. All 3 media have different issues, so it&#39;s appropriate
    to have 3 solutions, i.e., one line for printed matter, 3 lines for &#34;outdoor&#34;,
    &amp; a less-bold version for web. <BR>

  body: The only thing the photoshop exercise will do is show you how they might look
    in those environments. It will not tell you how they perform in those environments.
    And in truth it may never get you in the ballpark. <BR> <BR>You are interested
    in how the design performs aren&#39;t you?

    You have me thinking about issues that otherwise would have never even come to
    mind. Let me try and respond to each of your excellent comments. <BR> <BR>JAMES
    &#40;BTW, your typefaces are absolutely AMAZING&#41; <BR> <BR>In regards to size,
    I&#39;m actually not sure. I
