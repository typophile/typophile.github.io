<p>This is the link posted by zeno333 ( <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/95122">http://www.typophile.com/node/95122</a> ) to know what is your favorite letter. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F691weEVpwc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F691weEVpwc</a> 
There is another thing towards the end of the video where Mr. Spiekermann criticizes Microsoft a lot. He goes to say that Microsoft is a company with bad tatse and stingy( since they didn&rsquo;t want to pay Linotype their license). He also says they commissioned Segoe to look like Frutiger and Arial to look  like Helvetica.
I think  Microsoft does a lot in the field of Typography(OpenType and VOLT). I also personally like Segoe UI more than Frutiger.
Do you think Mr. Spiekermann is right here?</p>
<p>Thanks
T</p>

<p>However, Arial does have its good points. It&rsquo;s less strongly oriented to display use than Helvetica - so it can also be used in place of Univers. So they got greater versatility in return for licensing only one typeface from Monotype instead of two from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Also, they <em>needed</em> to license Times Roman, and <em>that&rsquo;s</em> a Monotype typeface - so maybe their reason was wanting to deal with only one vendor. You get discounts that way.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve always understood this history simply in terms of Monotype being Microsoft&rsquo;s go-to font provider at that time, so they ended up licensing Arial instead of Helvetica and, most controversially, Book Antiqua instead of Palatino. Microsoft&rsquo;s relationship with Monotype was very close: Monotype personnel were stationed at Microsoft&rsquo;s Redmond headquarters, mostly doing TT hinting.</p>
<p>Later, MS licensed Palatino Linotype &ndash; in part, I believe, to try to right the wrong &ndash;, but for backwards compatibility reasons decided that they couldn&rsquo;t ditch Book Antiqua. So Windows now ships with both font families.</p>
<p>Segoe&hellip; well, that&rsquo;s a later and still controversial development, but I don&rsquo;t think it can be ascribed to not wanting to pay the license fee for Frutiger <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger#Frutiger_Linotype">because MS had already licensed Frutiger from Linotype by that point</a>.</em></p>

Adobe software has its own type rendering engine, so it effectively shields you from 'local' OS oddities.
As a consequence, one of the things that can go wrong with this workflow is Apple's proprietary changes to perfectly good fonts.
For one, it has been <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/message/4320355">noted on the Adobe InDesign forum</a> that Apple's version of Baskerville has such weird hinting that Adobe's rendering actually makes it worse to read, rather than the perfectly good job they pull off with your average font.
The system font "Helvetica Neue" is so messed up that it has been <a href="http://www.fontgeek.net/blog/?p=253">advised to entirely avoid it</a> (even if you can get it to work, sometimes you get pretty weird results when trying to embed it into a PDF).
Their private implementation of embedding color bitmaps into the Apple Emoji font is exactly that: private, undocumented, and not supported by any other software than Apple's (see <a href="http://typophile.com/node/96671">Unicode Definition For Dummies? Also: pixel precision</a> for a full discussion).
Likewise, Apple's Advanced Typographic options are only available in Apple's own software; <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/thread/1079342">InDesign cannot access them</a>.
<p>Compare this with Microsoft&rsquo;s continuous updating of Uniscribe (their OpenType interpreter), to such a point that Word, lousy as it may be, effortlessly displays complex interacting glyphs where InDesign, Adobe&rsquo;s &ldquo;flagship of typography&rdquo; fails miserably.</div>

<p>MS was having serious PR problems, and users were jumping ship. So they cooked this up:</p>

<li>Create an OS that Windows users didn’t like (Vista)</li>

		<div class="commentbody">I was doing work for both Linotype and Microsoft at the time of the development of Palatino Linotype, and had the story from both sides. Bruno Steinert was head of Linotype at the time, and was a good friend, as were many of the people involved in the project on the Microsoft side (Geraldine Wade, Mike Duggan, Greg Hitchcock). Bruno had hoped that Palatino Linotype would replace Book Antiqua, in Windows and Office, but because of existing user documents set in Book Antiqua and the lack of metrics compatibility between the two fonts, Microsoft decided that it could not remove support for that font. But at least, through the Palatino Linotype project, Hermann Zapf and Linotype received money from Microsoft for the licensing of the legitimate type.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve since learned that Arial was based on Monotype Grotesque, and its significance was that it had the same metrics as Helvetica. Back in the old days, when the HP LaserJet was the standard for laser printing, one had to buy fonts for one&rsquo;s laser printer as well as for one&rsquo;s computer, since the connection between the computer and the laser printer had enough bandwidth to send the characters you were printing to the laser printer&hellip; not the raster of the page to be printed.</p>
<p>Of course, this also followed the precedent of impact printers (daisywheel printers and various kinds of line printers such as band printers, chain printers, and drum printers) and dot matrix printers.</p>
<p>I see from Wikipedia, however, that Arial was indeed not commissioned by Microsoft as a display font corresponding to Helvetica. Instead, it started out as Sonoran Sans Serif on the IBM 3800 high-volume laser printer. In IBM&rsquo;s case, the reason the metrics were matched with those of Helvetica was that Helvetica was licensed for a higher-resolution laser printer also manufactured by IBM (600 dpi as against 240 dpi).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I personally prefer Book Antiqua over Palatino Linotype since it has been supplied with Office since version 4.3 (1994). I also find the default line spacing of Palatino Linotype too wide. A lot of organisations prescribe Book Antiqua to be used for documents. So there are millions of documents set in Book Antiqua. That explains why Microsoft could not remove it back in 2000 and replace it with Palatino Linotype. They certainly could not remove it today, since the amount of documents in Book Antiqua has been growing ever since.</p>
<p>Did you know there exists a Book Antiqua Parliamentary? It is being used by the British Parliament. I found this explanation from a House of Commons official:</p>
<blockquote>We understand that Book Antiqua is published by Monotype and made available under license by Microsoft in some of their software packages. We can confirm that the Book Antiqua Parliamentary font is the same as standard Book Antiqua apart from the use of curved as opposed to straight quotation marks. You might also like to know that there are Book Antiqua Parliamentary 2 and Book Antiqua Parliamentary 3 fonts which handle Welsh characters (circumflex and caret (to bach))and a Parliamentary Symbols font that has a star, diamond and hollow star which can appear in Papers relating to Bills.</blockquote>
<p>So we can conclude that Book Antiqua is here to stay.</p>
