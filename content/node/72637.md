    policies, since many years I suggest to set monochromatic laser printers to use
    Black at 90% (instead of 100%). To office usage this produces a rather good result
    with relevant economy. In the Tribunal where I work they are adopting this (and
    also using just recycled paper)."

  body: "A recent newspaper ad for Audi featured a font with holes in it, a metaphor
    for the \"green\" construction of their lightweight automobile.\r\n\r\nThis creative
    gem was full page, featuring acres (metaphorically) of white space. (Well, grey
    space anyway, it was after all newsprint.)\r\n\r\nWhen I started Earthmark, an
    environmental marketing company, in 1989, one of our promises was to help reduce
    clients' environmental footprint, by means of expertise in producing powerful
    small advertisements and brochures. That was probably one of the reasons for Earthmark's
    demise -- there's no glory in small ads for product managers, agencies, or creatives,
    regardless of their efficacy in shifting product.\r\n\r\nAs long as print marketing
    continues to rely on cheap size for impact, \"saving the environment\" by using
    less ink on a percentage basis is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nIn the world at large, pollution
    of all kinds has proceeded because industry standards are based on risk assessment
    tied to percentage concentrations, rather than capping toxic emissions to the
    finite nature of the physical environment.\r\n\r\nIn graphics, the high resolution
    of the digital workflow has arguably produced the most benefit to the environment,
    by enabling smaller documents. Newspaper rolls have been steadily decreasing in
    width, and newspapers in size, with the decline of that industry.\r\n\r\nIncreased
    resolution enables a downsizing of paper-size standards in general, such as has
    already happened in the newspaper business. (This process has been going on in
    garment industry dress sizes for many years).\r\n\r\nIt is time to shrink A4 etc.,
    and 8 1/2\" x 11\". \r\n"

    method:</strong>\r\n1. I set an article with 16 pages in InDesign with each of
    the fonts.\r\n2. Edited font size to match text extension.\r\n3. Exported each
    article to PDF.\r\n4. In Photoshop, imported these PDFs and rasterized them in

  body: Smaller fonts with more conventional proportions are easier to read than narrow
    fonts, no? I'm not a lab coated font scientist but I believe that to be true.
    If the goal is squeezing in more text on the page, go smaller and use type designed
    for small print. Save vertical space too. Those old, tiny pocket bibles had type
    designed for ridiculously small point sizes. I'm not against the concept of the
    eco font, but I don't see how compressed type is easier to read than smaller type.
    I haven't read a bible for more than 3 seconds so I'm just assuming that they're
    easy to read. I do know that they're tiny and employ special bible fonts which
    I haven't seen anywhere outside of a bible.

  body: 'There are several things to think about when discussing print savings.  First,
    output frequently contains images, and no font in the world can help save toner
    or ink on that, and images are usually much denser than text.  Second, ecofont
    does not support all text sizes, according to their website, they generally print
    only text up to 11 points in their font, switching to the standard font for larger
    text.  Therefore, ecofont maybe excellent within its limitations, but there are
    alternatives for printing economically without having to tweak printer settings
    for every printer individually, use draft mode (about 10% savings in average and
    poor quality output) or forcing users to change their fonts.  Our software, PretonSaver
    (see http://www.reduceprintcosts.com for information and explanation on how the
    magic happens) is certified to achieve savings of 25% to 40% of overall toner
    consumption in typical enterprise environments with no degradation in print quality.   '
