    hold it right there, pardner: SC's (real ones) are different glyphs than caps
    \u2014 mostly somewhat darker in color and a little broader. Mixing them up is
    a no-no for a real typo-cowboy.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

    sample is set in ALL CAPS.\r\nAnd the REAL CAPS are the same in SC and Regular.\r\nSo
    it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s SC or regular lower case.\r\n\r\nAlright,
    pardner?"
