  be printed in a magazine I work for, but the original artist forgot which font she
  used, as it was years ago, and just leaving it as is does not look good due to low
  quality. \r\n\r\nI'm hoping that someone here can help identify the font, since
  I'm stumped.\r\n\r\nAlso, the file attachment system malfunctioned, so here's an
