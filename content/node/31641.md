  used on the Calvin Klein logo.\r\nI first thought it was Futura, but the C isn't
  quite right, and the e is more round. Then I thought of Avenir, but the a isn't
  right, neither is the K. Century Gothic doesn't fit (i, K), and myFont.com's WhatTheFont
  guessed it was Litera, wich it isn't (look at the e, the i and the K).\r\n\r\nSo,
  do you know what the exact font might be?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :)"
