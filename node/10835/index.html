  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Here's the main weight of Patria, my first &quot;serious&quot; Latin text face. It's part of a larger system which contains &quot;counter-balanced&quot; Armenian fonts (it's a long story - as you might suspect). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/plat_reg.swf">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/plat_reg.swf</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You'll need to do a fair amount of zooming, and please pardon the occasional outline infidelity that Flash introduces (like in the inner part of the lc &quot;j&quot;'s tail, the top-right of the numeral &quot;2&quot;, et alia). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm daring to cast Patria as a next-generation newspaper face (or at least a face fit for magazines). Its x-height is somewhat small for this purpose, because I place more value on boumas (word shapes) than most designers. Also, it actually sets narrower than it looks, maybe because the open, generous forms increase its apparent size/width. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've tried to give Patria a full-bodied rigidity (read: masculinity) that seems to me to be lacking in the field of text face design. The Carolingian structures are generally very fluid/feminine, which is nice, except I feel there's too much of it now. Blackletter is very masculine, but it's not really usable any more (or at least not right now). The post-modern boys use a lot of rigidity, but they tend to apply it too literally to allow for immersive reading - I've tried to be more subtle. On the other hand, in certain places I've consciously sacrificed readability in order to reinforce the design's character (like in making the lc &quot;s&quot; somewhat wide). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&mdash;- <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hadn't looked at Patria for over two months, but now that I'm re-evaluating it, I can see a few things I'd like to change, pending feedback from you guys: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. I want to make the beaks that come off of horizontal bars (like in the UC &quot;F&quot;) much larger. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. I'm going to rethink the numerals. I'm considering making them Carter-style (&quot;hybrid&quot;) numerals, but the all-horizontal stress I really cherish. Any ideas? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. I'm also unhappy with a number of the non-alphabetic glyphs, but I'll wait for you to tell me which ones *you* don't like! And I guess that applies to the *alphabetic* glyphs too&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. I personally prefer the alternate UC &quot;U&quot;, but hesitate to place it as the primary form. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5. Are the accents too small? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6. In the Italics: even though I want it to be rigid like the Roman (in fact, I like it to be as close to the Roman as aesthetically and functionally possible), I think I'm going to make the beaks/terminals (like in the lc &quot;s&quot;) softer in contour. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7. The spacing was a rush job - it needs to be redone. Also, I'm starting to think that it's too loose overall, unless I should account for severe ink bleed - in case my original target medium (newspapers) is reasonable. Lastly, I've yet to add any UC-UC kerning (there are just some manual tweaks right now). For this, I'm considering giving all UC pairs wide spacing, since it helps all-caps setting. Crazy? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8. I'm considering making midcaps (like in Fenway). If I do, then I might implement that overall loose UC spacing I just mentioned for the midcaps, but not the regular &quot;full&quot; caps. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9. I will eventually put trapping in the font - the degree of trapping depends very much on the best usage medium for this face. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&mdash;- <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have a lot of trouble evaluating my own work (especially something outside Armenian, my specialty), and have to constantly fight myself to find the right compromises, so any insight would be greatly appreciated. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">An impressive piece of work that is swimming in subtlety. It is very readable, from what I can tell of the small paragraph.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can tell you what I don't like far easier than what I do, because I like the sum of the parts, but not neccessarily the parts themselves.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't like the numbers at all. I think you should go back to the drawing board with them. I don't think any newspaper designer would want to use these as they're more designery (is that a word?) than utilitarian. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The italic is a little too subtly angled. The word &quot;system&quot; hardly stands out at all in that sample paragraph. Also, given the overall aesthetic I don't think it's neccessary to make the italic version so similar in lettershape to the regular.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I cannot see this working as a headline or subheading font, unless you have something up your sleeve for the bold and black versions. The individual letters are not pretty enough, at least not in this regular version, and at least not in my opinion.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;g&quot;: I would have thought that with a vertically stressed font you should avoid the diagonal swoop of the top of the lower bowl. Apart from the &quot;s&quot; this is the only letter that doesn't conform vertically.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That &quot;U&quot; works fine, like Stephen says. But apart from that one instance I can only say that I like the overall effect, but I can't point to anything specific as I think that for the most part you've successfully designed a font that works for word shapes and high readability.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Guys, thanks for all the feedback so far. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's proving even more valuable than I expected. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stephen: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the italic is very lovely <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wow, thanks. I'm surprised to hear that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the overhangs on the 'f' and 'r' distract.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the Italic, right? Well, I think I agree. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Probably the paucity of serifs in the Italic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is causing the beaks to stand out too much. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The beaks bigger? A la Eureka?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I assume you mean in the Roman only, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> and not the &quot;f&quot; or &quot;r&quot; in any case.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eureka is a great design, and there's stuff in Patria (eg the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serifs) that's pretty similar. Some of my beaks are larger, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some of them *need* to be larger, but I'll note one significant <!-- raw HTML omitted -->difference (which is also the case with Foundry's Form, as well <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as FF's new Zine, and Parkinson's Azuza): the beaks are abrupt, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not adnate like mine. Formally, that's the way to do it, since <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they then match the structure of the serifs. And I almost went <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that way myself, except I realized that it makes the design too <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mechanical in a way. I wanted to express more depth in my design, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->so I'm going for a different level -or maybe flavor- of harmony, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->even though I'll surely get some flack for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I might still change my mind, but some people have actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->appreciated the duality, so I've kept it. But if I do change <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my mind, I'd soften the serifs instead of hardening the beaks. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Why hesitate on the 'U'? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because many people hate it. My main reason for preferring it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is authenticity: I think that's how the Romans would've made it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My &quot;d&quot; is in a similar vein, except I found a compromise <!-- raw HTML omitted -->between the pure structural form (like Gill used), versus <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the established one (which is way too homogenous with some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->other characters -most notably the &quot;b&quot;- for my taste). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh, and there's some of my Alphabet Reform in there too&hellip;  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Martin: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I don't think any newspaper designer would <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; want to use [those numerals] as they're more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; designery (is that a word?) than utilitarian. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You have a point. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, the best word I've encountered for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what you're describing is &quot;mannered&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The italic is a little too subtly angled. The word &quot;system&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; hardly stands out at all in that sample paragraph. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I don't think it's neccessary to make the italic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; version so similar in lettershape to the regular. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is a complex issue, and I worry about getting too deeply <!-- raw HTML omitted -->into it here. I think I'll start another thread (eventually). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the moment, let me quickly state the following (hoping <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that it's not too cryptic): when it comes to text fonts, I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->think there's a huge difference between what we consiously <!-- raw HTML omitted -->see versus what we think we see when immersed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I cannot see this working as a headline or subheading font, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; unless you have something up your sleeve for the bold and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; black versions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You're right. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The display cuts would have to be much more regular. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note that my bold is a text bold, not a display bold. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(But as with the italics, a full elaboration of the <!-- raw HTML omitted --> argument is certainly needed.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's actually an interesting paradox, the text versus <!-- raw HTML omitted -->display conflict. Certainly, a text font can be made to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->look less ugly than it can get away with at small sizes, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but I ponder the true limits of that. I have this hunch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that any real -I mean really real- text font has to have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a certain ugliness. If that sounds crazy, just look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some of Tracy's work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But maybe Patria could be less ugly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The &quot;g&quot;: I would have thought that with a vertically stressed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; font you should avoid the diagonal swoop of the top of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; lower bowl. Apart from the &quot;s&quot; this is the only letter that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; doesn't conform vertically. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not surpisingly, I've thought long and deep about the &quot;g&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My conclusions are somewhat unorthodox, but if I don't <!-- raw HTML omitted -->follow them I'd be hypocritical. More to come&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stephen: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I think they stand out *too* much, and only because the weight is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; too light. Even it up with the roman and keep the angle as it is. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note also that the x-height of the Italic is smaller. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The weight calibration issue doesn't bother me, because everything is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on an axis. I just need to do some real print runs from Lino output to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->decide the exact weight locations. What is increasingly worrying me, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->though, is the extremes: they might be too close, especially the Bold. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tiffany: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; maybe there is too much 'scotch' in [the numerals]? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now that's interesting. Do you mean that they're too <!-- raw HTML omitted -->curly or something? Or that they need to sober up?  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The '2', '4' and '6' seem the most in need a fewer curves?? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(What about the &quot;9&quot;?) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree on the &quot;2&quot;, but the &quot;4&quot; is my darling. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the &quot;6&quot;/&quot;9&quot;, I'm probably going to change them <!-- raw HTML omitted -->completely, making them bowl-with-curved-diagonal-stick. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(BTW, concerning the numerals, I'm sure you can tell that they're coming <!-- raw HTML omitted --> from that thread I once started about &quot;Latinized Arabic&quot; numerals.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stephen: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; [The 'f' and 'r' hang too much] in the roman as well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remember my penchant for promoting boumas (word shapes). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Roman's &quot;f&quot; especially I'm pretty content with. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But its &quot;r&quot; is admittedly more difficult to justify. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Not fan of the 'g' either. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->:-( <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I'd buy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cool. Just send me 500 Euro in advance, wire- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->transfer to my Cayman Islands account is fine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ole: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; can you explain the design concepts of the fl and fi ligatures <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, Bob, I'm very happy you asked that question!  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Different fonts need different tactics for the f-ligatures, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but for some reason most designers appear to be to shackled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to some strange standards that were established who know how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->long ago and for what peculiar reasons (maybe for showmanship). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My ligatures look like that because to me making a font work <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is more important than pleasing the establishment. If my x- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->height were smaller, I'd probably merge the &quot;f&quot;'s beak with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the &quot;i&quot;'s dot in the &quot;fi&quot;. On the other hand, the conventional <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;fl&quot; ligature in particular usually looks horrid; it's really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a mannered display-font trick, not something text-worthy. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I decided to chop off the el's top serif. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Martin: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; there seems to me to be not enough difference in the weights. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is actually the same deal as with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Italic issue you were making above. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; looking at the screen is less than optimal <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's difficult to over-emphasize that. The lack of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->congruence between the screen and the actual printed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->end-result is really staggering. Even a 1200 dpi laser <!-- raw HTML omitted -->doesn't cut it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; it's of primary importance in designing a text family. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Totally. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jacques: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; You are using more flat curves (Lc 's' e.g.) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; and very round ones (Lc 'c' e.g.). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I would to try to make the 'flat' <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; curves a little bit rounder. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This opens up another interesting world! Remembering that my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->intention is to give Patria a certain rigid masculinity, let <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me ask: what's more rigid, a perfect circle, or an ellipse?&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I totally agree that making the &quot;s&quot; more curvy would make <!-- raw HTML omitted -->things more harmonious, overall. But a very circular form is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->perhaps &quot;closer&quot; to a straight form in a more nebulous way. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, a curvy &quot;s&quot; would make the font too feminine. Note the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->other important glyphs which have some unexpected straight <!-- raw HTML omitted -->segments: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;g&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Lc 'g': I would close his belly, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; or try to find a more subtle ending. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Like I said above, I'll try to elaborate more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the future, but for now let me just say this: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. I believe that the closed-bowl bicameral &quot;g&quot; is a flawed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   structure in terms of the nature of the Latin alphabet. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. The strong ending reinforces boumas. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; If this face is to become a face for newspaper, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I wouldn't experiment too much with structure, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; as you did with Lc 'd'. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's a good point. Although I feel my structure <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is more readable, it might be going too strongly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->against expectations. Gill got away with a much <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more unconventional form&hellip; but that was Gill! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the eye of the Lc 'e' is too big <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's too big for optimal readability, true. But that's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one place where I decided to sacrifice a little bit of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->readability for character. Some other places: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. The &quot;a&quot;'s middle bar is too rigid. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. The &quot;a&quot;, &quot;g&quot; and &quot;s&quot; are all too wide, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   and too big-headed (which are actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   structurally related things). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, check out this &quot;e&quot; (on the bottom-right): <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Character0065Style8019.html">http://www.myfonts.com/Character0065Style8019.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's butt-ugly, but man, does it ever work like a charm! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, I should consider making a more tame/readable version <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of Patria, but in any case the differences will be very subtle, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at least on the surface. What to call it?&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, very much of these critiques here seems to me to be related <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to the display versus text issue. When I hesitate about some of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the good points you all make, it's because I'm cautious in my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hazy understanding of the feral wolf that is text face design, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->versus the domesticated hound that is display design. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

Also, Father's 1964 book, &quot;Eric Gill: His Social and Artistic Roots&quot; is an excellent elucidation. It expounds on several of his highly influential theories.

So that's where it's probably different than Catich's ideas (I hope&hellip;). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, you could say that Patria has some Gill in it (like look at Joanna's italic), and that might tie in to Catich too.

The italic was *not* derived from the roman - they're more like sister and brother. The father being a third design code-named Harrier, which is essentially a pretty unorthodox semi-serif sloped roman. It's a stand-alone design, but it spawned both the roman and italic of Patria (in parallel). Now here's where it gets really strange. Harrier was inspired by Nour (Patria's Armenian counterpart) and subsequently became a Latin design subordinate to it*; Nour itself is [in part] based on the first Armenian type (made in Venice in the first quarter of the 16th century), which was the principal style of type until about a hundred years ago, and still gets a lot of use. And this first type itself was based on medieval manuscripts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Patria eventually got a subordinate Armenian design - to balance everything out.

And this is actually where the slant of Harrier and Patria-italic comes from. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, since I had plenty of time and no handy access to a computer, I went ahead and drew the letters as close to their (hopefully) final form as I could. It feels like I did more erasing than drawing, but as you can see I still made some small markings concerning adjustments. But in the end, only one letter (out of 38 x 2 characters) underwent a structural change. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->During ATypI's conference in Leipzig I realized that I simply *had* to make a Latin partner for Nour, and the evening after I went to a bar (called &quot;Letterman&quot;!), and over some Obsolut Mandarin I drew some rough stuff: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_leipzig.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_leipzig.gif</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I with I could blame the vodka for the poor quality, but the truth is my freehand-drawing skills suck. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A couple of days later I drew these at a sushi bar in Frankfurt: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_frankfurt.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_frankfurt.gif</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was over some Sapporo and a spider roll, so I guess that explains &quot;krab&quot;&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The next day in Amsterdam, a few hours before boarding my plane back to LA, I was having some mint tea in a place called Goa, and I made a breakthrough: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_amsterdam.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_amsterdam.gif</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I say breakthrough because I figured out exactly how to apply my beloved &quot;rigidity&quot;, and drew the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot; (a couple of *very* important characters) to satisfaction. You can also see the original &quot;g&quot;, which I saw as too rigid in the end. That &quot;g&quot; also had a &quot;rationalist&quot; stroke contrast distribution, but I decided to compromise it with what other type designers expected to see.  :-/ <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back in LA, I started doing the &quot;scannable&quot; drawings, but since I then had much more time-pressure as well as easy access to a computer, I didn't bother to &quot;normalize&quot; the weight, slant, width, or even the proportions - since those can be done with software. I drew the structures, and experimented a bit too (note the &quot;k&quot;). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_la.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier_la.gif</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->After a pretty long, sporadic process, I ended up with the beta version of Harrier (around the spring of 2001): <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier-beta.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/harrier-beta.gif</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At this point, I decided to make a somewhat complex &quot;balanced&quot; typeface system which combines Armenian and Latin fonts in different ways to maximize versatility. Among other things, this included the creation of the weight extremes for each of the 5 master designs. Harrier changed a little and became the Latin style subordinate to Nour, and it also spawned Patria and its italic, in parallel. After that, Patria got a subordinate Armenian style - which looks a lot like most of those current Armenian designs I mention above! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/nour-latin.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/nour-latin.gif</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/patria-italic.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&amp;amp;patria/dev/patria-italic.gif</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although different in proportions, &quot;serif-ness&quot;, terminals, and even some characters (like the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;g&quot;), the two are structurally the same.

And if I reconcile them, should I make the serifs smooth (going towards early 20th century transitional designs, like Times), or should I make the beaks abrupt (like a lot of contemporary work - Eureka comes to mind)? Once I answer this line of questioning (hopefully with your help), I can start thinking about releasing this thing already! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

The value of a good library (especially one with Inter-Library-Loan capability) cannot be overstated. Part of the reason for this is that -even if you're a submissive person, which I'm not- practically nobody will teach you too much these days unless you pay them. And since there's little money in type design now, this doesn't tend to work out&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But even more important than reading and learning is *thinking* - on your own. I do that a lot, and it helps to guide my creativity too. One other thing: some people are better at learning through doing, others (like me) through thinking. You have to do both, of course, but it's important to take account of what kind of person you are - especially if you have a mentor (who might be incompatible with your &quot;style&quot;). And if you do have a mentor/teacher, always keep a core of doubt - see him as an equal, although you might have to keep that a secret from him. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, the Typophile boys *have* made a &quot;compilation&quot; (but just the first 50 fonts, so far): <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://typophile.com/gallery/index.html">http://typophile.com/gallery/index.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I thought the descenderless Q was for all-caps titling. Anyway. . . purely on aesthetic grounds, just taken as they are here, I like numbers 2,3, &amp; 5. (1-12, left to right, top to bottom) The corners are subtle, but they help differentiate from the O. I'd still like to see the tail extended slightly beyond the right edge, maybe 15-20 units. I think the bottom concept works, but without seeing the rest of the caps I can't judge how it fits in. Among the four, I prefer number 12. I'm not crazy about the extra spur inside, but 10 is preferable to 11.</div>

I will have an alternate that descends (like the top-left one but a lot shorter), but this is for the main form. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I think the bottom concept works <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note that the &quot;serif&quot; form (on the outside) is the only such form in the font, which might be a problem. But anyway the only good reason I can think of to have a part on the inside is if otherwise it looks too much like an &quot;O&quot;. Since the inside part is a bit disruptive, and the top two rows contain plenty of designs that are sufficiently different than an &quot;O&quot; (especially for a Display cut; and especially the ones with a corner at the bottom-left, like you said), I think I won't go inside. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for the feedback!

		<div class="commentbody">Seriously digging the Italic. I haven't actually done an italic yet, but I'm inspired by the seeming inconsitent slant.

The shallow slant of the leg is spectacular. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm having a hard time with the tail on the g. It kind of meanders without strength or direction. The concept is not that far off; as a matter of fact, I really like the g from harrier.

Also, I don't mind picturing what the/a hand might do in drawing a letter, but I don't actually draw forms by hand - just the outlines - otherwise it's not really type.

That said, there's certainly room for improvement at the glyph level. The &quot;w&quot; for example used to be even wider! But maybe it still needs work. The &quot;s&quot; is light during deliberative observation, but its crowded structure means a lighter weight makes it look better for normal/small text - look at the &quot;s&quot; in Lexicon.

The f-ligs need help, yes; they might have a bit too much ideology in them&hellip; BTW, the separate &quot;f&quot;+&quot;i&quot; don't touch - although Cambria's trick might indeed be an extra help. The abridged serifs on the &quot;m&quot; I'm unsure about: more than any readability issue (in fact the point was to pull it away from similar letters, and reduce clotting) I think it just might be too ugly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, note the setting of the title of my article: it's a first jab at making a display cut, where things are much more regularized. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sergej, you have a point, but I think it's more useful to think of it this way: the more character a font has (and I think it doesn't matter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->whose<!-- raw HTML omitted --> character it is) the harder it is to use well broadly, but the more it can shine in certain uses. In making Patria I didn't consciously try to put more or less of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->myself<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I did want to put &quot;character traits&quot; that I value into it (like sturdiness, via the serif style and those few overly-wide glyphs), and I guess that naturally means there's something of me in it - that's where the &quot;art&quot; in font design comes from, after all. While I think making a font to consiously express one's own character is a bad -or at least selfish- idea, I do think that &quot;unforced&quot; expression is natural and even desirable - you just have to be able to control it sufficiently (if never totally). So sometimes a font is usefully expressive, other times (like in the Baskerville I'm making) one has to be much more careful, more &quot;modest&quot;. So some fonts need to be more neutral than others, depending on how one would like to see them used. Most importantly there's room for both, and -as I think Paul is saying- there's not enough of the &quot;personal&quot; in most contemporary <!-- raw HTML omitted -->text<!-- raw HTML omitted --> faces - although there's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plenty<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the realm of display. And this is probably because text design relies incredibly on subtlety, and this includes the subtletly of (unforced) self-expression - knowing how much to weight it, knowing where/how to place the design in the spectrum of potential usage. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it is very hard to decide to add character to a font like adding a spice to a dish.  Character comes about naturally and is inextricably part of the face if it is unconsciously part of the designer. When I first saw Patria in TYPO 13, I was distracted by it&ndash;not in a bad way but in a new-toy way.  Newness brings a certain thump to the senses which mellows with more exposure.  I think Patria works for me more after seeing it a few times.  There are some strange spacing issues with double t, double r, and double f in particular. Perhaps ligs would fix it but I think the right sidebearing of all 3 needs a shaving. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It has a bit of a Benguiat flavor but without the calligraphic feel. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nice work Hrant&ndash;keep at it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ChrisL</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If I'm right, Chris's experience is the desired outcome (at least for a letterform-aware, but open-minded person). Because Patria is &quot;pushy&quot;, not conformant to the conventions of contemporary mainstream type design, it must necessarily feel a bit different (if only as a &quot;tingle&quot; to the layman - which Chris is not). It is gradual familiarity which brings the reader back into the &quot;comfort zone&quot;, with the added -and otherwise unattainable- benefit of functional improvement (slightly better readability). It is my hope that this &quot;familiarity factor&quot; kicks in quickly enough, and sufficiently, for the initial discomfort to be worth suffering; my gambit is that the learning of better boumas isn't wasted. Paradoxically however, this can only be the case if there's more to readability then mere familiarity (and of course there is). I'm pretty confident about the bouma nature of reading, but the true nature and rate of familiarity is what still eludes me, and really everybody else it seems: the chirographers use it to justify the continued insecure clinging to the pen/hand/arm system, while the PoMo hooligans use it to justify whatever they happen to be feeling that afternoon - but nobody really knows. That's the next step, for me at least - and it can change [almost] everything. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll take a close look at the funny spacing you've noticed - thanks! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't like Goudy's stuff either (although from what I know about the man I think I would have liked him as a person). But that's secondary (at most). The important thing is that a large number of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->users<!-- raw HTML omitted --> like his fonts, and that creates a responsability in a craftsman (if not an artiste). A lot of people love Helvetica - some of them because they think it's &quot;neutral&quot;, and they admire that. That might be fine for them (maybe), but certainly there's more to life than that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I think the only one learning will be you. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's not so bad. I certainly can't force other people to learn from it. But I think you're being a bit too negative. If I know that I for one can learn from the successes/mistakes of others, why wouldn't others be able to as well? All it takes is paying attention. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In terms of familiarity, the questions are: exactly what are we gaining familiarity with when we &quot;learn&quot; a new font; and how fast does this happen? For example, if it takes 10 exposures of an &quot;o&quot; and 10 of an &quot;s&quot; to become comfortable -beyond a certain threshold of comfort, leading to &quot;full&quot; immersion- with a certain form of a &quot;g&quot;, then all this historical chirographic baggage is 100% pointless, it's purely a restriction; but if it takes tens of thousands of exposures of various kinds of &quot;g&quot;s that share something important (like &quot;proper&quot; ductus) to become truly comfortable with that class of &quot;g&quot;, that means a non-conformant &quot;g&quot; can almost never become sufficiently comfortable. The truth is probably somewhere in between these; I personally think closer to the former. But most of all: we don't know. Anybody who uses familiarity to justify his design ideology and/or strike down that of another is an escapist. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I still remember the huge envelopes you sent me years ago ;)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->After I compared the printed version of the TYPO magazine (which has your essay set in Patria) with your Flash samples, I realized how *inappropriate* it is to judge type on screen. I recommend everybody ordering the printed copy of TYPO (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.magtypo.cz">http://www.magtypo.cz</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> ) or even better, subscribing to it!  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seriously, looking at the printed Patria in TYPO:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The italic is far more regular, better spaced and more pleasing to read than the roman.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Actually, Patria roman isn't pleasant to read. (To me.) I compare pages 7 and 15 in TYPO, i.e. I compare Patria with Charter, which is used to set Kevin Larson's article just two pages before. I know, it's aiming high since Charter is just damn good and comes from the world's best type designer (IMO).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In this comparison, Patria doesn't get away very well. Some letters space in a really awkward manner, and some letters produce truly awkward boumas. Look at the word &quot;little&quot; in &quot;there's little reason to doubt&quot;. The second &quot;t&quot; is surrounded by much more whitespace than the rest, truly jumps out of the line. Similar problem with &quot;c&quot;: &quot;difficult&quot; reads almost like &quot;diffi c ult&quot;. The &quot;f&quot; is also strangely spaced, e.g. &quot;refuses&quot; reads like &quot;ref uses&quot;. The &quot;e&quot; is much narrower than other letters would let presume. The &quot;z&quot; is much wider than I would like it to be. The quotes are strangely spaced in (or &quot;familiarity&quot;), the word space after &quot;or&quot; becomes invisible. The forms of &quot;s&quot; and especially &quot;w&quot; are very strange. I think the &quot;w&quot; will look even stranger in Polish which has many &quot;w&quot;s.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But above all: IMO, the roman is just too widely and unevenly spaced. You did a much better job on the italic so you know how to space. Trash the spacing of your roman and do it again. It really doesn't have to be that loose.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, I just noticed that ParaType has just released Haverj, a new typeface by Manvel Shmavonyan based on Henrik Mnatsakanyan's lettering. It is obvious that Haverj and Patria draw from the same tradition, and that the Armenian influence cannot be overlooked.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regards,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adam</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Adam, thanks for the candid review! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I realized how *inappropriate* it is to judge type on screen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Especially a text font, especially in Flash! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Patria (both the Roman and Italic) were derived from Harrier* (the Latin that's &quot;formally&quot; subordinate to the Armenian), which I think I spaced very well. The spacing of Patria was a retrofit (just to get it ready for Bukvaraz), and I guess the Italic is closer to Harrier than the Roman is, so maybe that's why it suffered less? I honestly don't know, because they both look &quot;adequately&quot; spaced to me: not extremely good, but better than average. For one thing, they're missing large chunks of kerning. And yeah, comparing it to Charter is either highly unfair or highly flattering.  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Which is the font in that stunt you once helped me pull! But I don't remember the envelopes being huge&hellip; At least not in SUV country. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I admit, the spacing needs to be redone. And I'll look at your specific complaints before I do that. BTW, another issue is that the four weights of Patria are uniwidth. I used to think I could make this work, but then I realized that the Light would have to become too wide to avoid being too loose, while the Bold the opposite (the Regular and Demi are fine in this respect, I think). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The &quot;e&quot; is much narrower than other letters would let presume. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't understand what you mean here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; It is obvious that Haverj and Patria draw from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the same tradition, and that the Armenian <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; influence cannot be overlooked.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is an interesting issue. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First one must realize that very few Latin readers will have actually looked at Armenian text, so at most this might result in an &quot;alien&quot; feel, and I agree that's bad in a text face (when it's so consciously noticed). But the correct [small] amount of alien feel simply translates to originality and freshness I think, at least when people don't know to read &quot;Armenian-ness&quot; into it, so that wouldn't put a certain ethnic spin on the atmosphere of the font. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clearly, Patria is indeed derived from a classical Armenian style, but the question is, is this influence strong enough to make people uneasy reading it? I personally doubt it. For one thing, when I show it to laymen and ask for opinions, they usually get embarassed because they can't tell what about it is different than Times! As one typography researcher was told when testing Georgia against something-or-other: &quot;This Times is easier to read than that Times&quot;&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But when it comes to Haverj, the &quot;j&quot; and &quot;f&quot; especially seem to put it further from the &quot;text epicenter&quot; than Patria, wouldn't you say? In any case though, it's an interesting and useful face*, and it does have some Armenian character, although it's more of the photofont era (and that &quot;K&quot;/&quot;R&quot; stuff is very Russian, or maybe 19th-century French, not at all Armenian). In contrast, Patria's Armenian character is from the Middle Ages, and applied more subtly (I hope). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Makes me think of an Armenian Priori (just shier). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

I do like your Harrier italic, posted on typophile, so I have been puzzled by the awkwardness of Patria. My theory is that you have let your various theories, right and wrong, be the judge, instead of your own eye. In any case, other people's eyes are going to be final arbiter.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Hrant. Now I see Harrier is just a &quot;Label&quot; name for that slanted Latin version in the Patria/Nour system. I think it is way better than the Latin's Italic. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And I found out you already sent me a PDF time ago and looked at it again. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This brought a double question, connected to Segej's observation: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) In fact, besides the Armenian/Latin system, which is of course very interesting, why should you want to read SO fast? Just to get more crap in your brain from newspaper articles? A book does not need to be read so fast. Inversely, it calls for immersive reading of a meditative quality. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Take this as a positive critique: after surpassing the initial &quot;itch&quot; I learned quickly to appreciate and understand your values and concerns. What I still think you should improve is merely the quality of drawn curves: OK for the overall functionality, but many of your glyphs (even the Armenian which I do not know) convey a sense of &quot;unfinished&quot;.</div>
