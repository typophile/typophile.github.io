    brilliamntly designed, almost all share one quaslity: they are almost impossible
    to read because they are set in type so tiny it makes the fine print of an insurance
    policy compare favorably with the NYTimes Large Type Edition. There is, I imagine,
    nothing to be done about the people who design such cards but the people who print
    them ought to speak up to their customers--and maybe even suggest that the backs
    of the cards be printed in a very plain design using a typeface that scans readily.'

    design I have ever seen. I was at the farmer's market one morning speaking with
    a cabinet maker. I asked him if he had a business card so he grabs a scrap of
    wooden veneer that he uses for inlays, pulls the carpenters pencil out from behind
    his ear and writes down his name and number. Efficient, environmentally conscious,
    appropriate and cost effective. And he didn't even need to hire a brand strategist.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/woodcard_3904.jpg]

  body: "{An edit brought this post ahead one spot.}\r\n\r\nActually the back of the
    card in that photo is the solid burgundy you can see in there, between the three
    face-up cards. The face is a paper that was too thin for a business card - but
    I just liked it and wanted to use it. So then I found a thick paper of a matching
    color and stuck it to the back! I think the result was better than what I thought
    I was getting myself into... I also did this design on a thick ecru stock that
    didn't need a backing. On that one you can see a faint show-through of the impression.
    Which to me is embarrassing. So I also did it on a thin version of the ecru paper,
    and added the backing. I also did one on peach paper. The first generation card
    (see the other Flickr photo) I did on half a dozen different papers, but no backing.\r\n\r\nThis
    BTW is my favorite thing about letterpress: the process is very custom and iterative.
    On the fly you can try different papers, impression pressures, number of inkings*,
    etc.; and it's all under your hands - no mystery print shop decisions between
    you and the object that represents you. What most people laud about letterpress
    - that it's \"organic\", \"irregular\", \"warm\" and whatnot - doesn't do much
    for me. On the other hand, I do have this crazy theory that letterpress text does
    in fact enjoy greater readability than offset, due to the gentler edges of the
    letterforms (assuming nothing greater than a kiss impression).\r\n\r\n* Changing
    your mind about the ink color is a pain though!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    business cards still represent \"official business\" between and among professionals.
    Many changes on business cards, I can say, are found on the added contact information
    (email address, others have Twitter or Facebook profile names) and on the evolving
    designs, stocks and coatings. "

    a new technology, such as physical cards that are perhaps the same size as current

    cards, and since their shape/size/etcetera was dictated by limitations, which
    are slowly changing, we'll just have a different way of handling them. The physical
    aspect plays an important role, so it's not as if they will disappear. In this
    current-day pool of twitter-puke and facebook-ism you might even say the value
    of a business card has increased.\r\n\r\nBut you can play a lot more with the
    definition of what a business card is, since the contact information which is
    placed on it isn't that important any more. On my last exposition my business
    cards were A2 posters folded to a tiny size (using thin stock), which with digital
    printing was quite cheap. This way I could give someone a lower quality, but usable,
    piece of my work, which I must say, worked really well in gathering interest."

      online print sellers - they print by the \"share-a-sheet\" process - normally
      20 different cards at a time - which is why they're so cheap.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid
      no litho or digital cards are collectable for me - imo they don't have any character,
      just flat and boring - no matter how good the design. Also the fact that they
      are all normally printed on the same standard 300/350/400gsm white coated card
      (plus matt lam) doesn't add any interest - although if spot gloss varnish is
      added it can give them a lift.\r\n\r\nI find it odd that a designer spends a
      lot of time fine-tuning his artwork and then has it printed by the quickest/cheapest
      process so it ends up \"just another business card\".\r\n\r\nWhereas all letterpress
      and foiled business cards printed on extra thick (540/700gsm) natural grained
      board are a piece of art that most people appreciate and will want to keep.\r\n\r\ndeeplyimpressed.co.uk/\r\n\r\nBest

      asking Chris Dean if he minded me contributing a few photo's to HIS thread but
      assumed he would let me know if there was a problem.\r\n\r\nI will not post
      any further photos unless Chris tells me it's ok.\r\n\r\n- David"

    cards" within Groups, there are some specialty groups too.

  body: "I only started the thread. Personally,  I don\u2019t believe anyone \u201Cowns\u201D
    a thread. In an instance like this, I think it\u2019s acceptable to post examples
    of one\u2019s work. In fact, if everyone posted examples of their own work here,
    it could be quite rich indeed. But apankrat does raise a valid point. There are
    instances where people can cross a line into the realm of primarily self promotion.
    Actually, it\u2019s more of a greyscale. In this instance however, I think we\u2019re
    OK. As long as it\u2019s something members are mindful of.\r\n\r\nIn an effort
    to keep this thread about <strong>business cards</strong> on topic I have started
    a new thread \u2014 <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/99675\">Posting or promoting?</a>
    \u2014 where we can discuss this in greater detail."

    business card part fit in? Perhaps something got lost in translation?
