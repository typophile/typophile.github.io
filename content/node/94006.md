  been trying to find out what exactly is this typeface I've seen in a flash template:
  http://activeden.net/item/ultimate-creative-template/full_screen_preview/16191\r\nThe
  \"John Smith Photographer\" text's font is what I would like to know.\r\n I've found
  similars, but not this one.\r\nThank you for your help in advance.\r\nNR\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_3996.jpg]"
