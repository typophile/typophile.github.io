body: "TORONTO, Canada, July 1, 2012 \u2013 Canada Type, a font development studio
  based in Toronto, has acquired the Rimmer Type Foundry (RTF) from P22 Type Foundry,
  Inc. The RTF library contains the complete body of work of Canadian design icon
  Jim Rimmer (1934\u20132010), who was an enormous influence on Canadian type design
  and private press printing, and the subject of Richard Kegler's documentary, <em>Making
  Faces: Metal Type in the 21st Century.</em> The RTF library contains many popular
  font families, such as Albertan, Amethyst, Credo, Dokument and Stern, as well as
  quite a few analog designs that were never produced in digital.\r\n\r\nNow that
  Rimmer's work has been repatriated, it will be remastered and expanded by Canada
  Type, then re-released to the public, starting in the fall of 2012. Jim's analog
  work will also be produced digitally and available to the public alongside his remastered
  and expanded work.\r\n\r\nOnce Jim's designs are re-released, part of their sales
  will be donated to fund the Canada Type Scholarship, an award given annually to
  design students in Canada. This will be done in coordination with the Society of
  Graphic Designers of Canada (GDC), the national professional association that awarded
  Jim Rimmer with the prestigious GDC Fellowship in 2007.\r\n\r\nAbout Canada Type\r\nCanada
  Type is a Toronto-based font development studio, founded in 2004 by Rebecca Alaccari
  and Patrick Griffin as means to provide professional type solutions to brands and
  creatives all over the world. The Canada Type retail library includes many widely-used
  original faces and notable historic revivals, featuring best-selling designs by
  Philip Bouwsma, Kevin King, Thomas Lincoln, Hans van Maanen, Rod McDonald, Bill
  Troop, and now Jim Rimmer. Canada Type's project-specific design and licensing clients
  include, among others, large publishing houses, telecom and media companies, hardware
  and software firms, film production studios, academic institutes and design agencies.\r\n\r\nAbout
  P22\r\nP22 type foundry, located in Buffalo, NY, has been creating digital fonts
  inspired by art and history since 1994. P22's auspicious beginning came in the art
  museum and gift shop marketplace due to co-owner Richard Kegler's background as
  a handmade book designer. The earliest font releases were based on artist handwriting
  and often paired a text font with a set of extras based on the artist's artwork.
  These sets were offered on a floppy diskette and then packaged within materials
  akin to 45-rpm style records. By the close of the decade, Richard and his business
  partner and wife, Carima El-Behairy, saw P22 emerge as one of the leading online
  independent type foundries, primarily due its work with museums and foundations
  on the development of accurate historical typefaces. Since 2000, P22 has expanded
  operations with the addition of new brands including the acquisition of the Lanston
  Type Company, with historical ties dating back to the 1800s. Today, the P22 library
  contains approximately 250 font families and well over 1,000 individual type styles.
  P22 continues to develop new type designs with enhanced OpenType features and webfont
  compatibility.\r\n\r\nAbout GDC\r\nFounded in 1956, the GDC is the certification
  body for graphic and communication designers in Canada. Only qualified graphic and
  visual communicators licensed by the GDC are entitled to use the CGD certification
  mark in relation to their services in Canada. With over 1,000 members across Canada,
  the GDC promotes high standards of design and ethics that benefit Canadian commerce,
  public service and education."

  body: I think it is a good move also. This was not a hostile takeover or a 'coup-de-font'.
    It is a very well considered mutual arrangement that is intended to be a benefit
    for all parties concerned. I trust Patrick to take the collection to a level that
    that we cannot commit to at this point in time. The scholarship program is a fitting
    and great extension of what Jim Rimmer was about. We look forward to future releases
    from RTF.
