  apologies for first post on this forum being one of needing assistance. I've only
  just discovered this forum and intend to participate in contributing in the future.\r\n\r\nI
  have an urgent request to identify the font in the image. I'm sure it's a Gothic
  font of some sort but I've had no success on identifying it. Any help would be most
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nPhil"

  body: It looks very much like Gotham. Keep in mind, if this is a logo it's very
    easy to customize characters. In fact it's preferred so that the logo isn't a
    dead-match for a particular font. You might also compare to Avenir and Proxima.
