body: "Hi,\r\nI'm trying to settle on fonts for a logotype that is a compound word
  (want to distinguish\r\nthe 2 parts of the word).\r\n\r\nLeaning towards a serif/sans
  mix but trick is finding a combo that has very similar x-height and shape, and lasting
  power for a logo.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 sets of double \"Os.\" This is where I'm stuck,
  to go with very round or very not round.\r\nAlso a lowercase \"g\" which is probably
  my favorite letter in double storey form.\r\n\r\nOverall look should be friendly,
  approachable.\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards Minion combined with either Syntax, Meta,
  Profile or Whitney (the last of which\r\nI don't own and will have to buy).\r\n\r\nAny
  opinions? \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I'm getting attached to Freight (which I don't own) and am a bit torn because
    it's so similar to Meta and Profile. Wondering if it's really worth the cost.
    I prefer Freight's "g" and I'm going to have to live with this for a while!
