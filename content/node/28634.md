  body: "Type design is part of some wider movements, such as art nouveau, but that
    was only minor in the type world. It also has its own movements.\r\n\r\nFor instance,
    in the early 20th century, say from 1900 to 1930, Historicism was huge.\r\nBy
    that is meant reviving centuries old typefaces, and creating page layouts and
    ads in comparable styles. While this started out as part of the arts and crafts
    movement, as did modernism, it went in the other direction. \r\n\r\nSome (eg Robin
    Kinross in Modern Typography) have called this \"New Traditionalism\", but that
    doesn't seem right, as it was actually a break with tradition, which had been
    evolutionary, not jumping all over the place.\r\n\r\nIn the design and typography
    histories that take their cue from art history, Historicism is generally downplayed,
    because there is no counterpart. But that's the difference between mass media
    culture, which is what type is part of, and elite art gallery culture."

      think that it's a bit of both. The arts & crafts and art nouveau periods, have
      obvious connections to much of the type of those eras. But in a roundabout way
      Bauhaus typography also grew out of those movements without being directly related
      to them, but it wasn't using new technology, either. Renaissance type and art
      were deeply influenced by interests in science and the humanities, but the art
      and type were not necessarily influenced by each other. So there are a lot of
      different kinds of connections between movements in art and type, and a lot
      of subtle considerations have to be accounted for to make sense of it all.  "

  body: "There was a movement, beginning in the early 1960s, and lasting for twenty
    years, when the trend was to set type tighter and tighter, both the space between
    letters, and leading. As Si suggests, this had much to do with the technology
    -- phototypositor, Letraset, and photosetting -- that made it possible. At the
    same time, type designers created faces with small x-heights, from Antique Olive
    thru a slew of ITC faces. I associate the tightness and the big x-height as a
    very coherent technical-aesthetic movement, but I don't believe it is widely identified
    as such, or has ever been given a name.\r\n\r\nI remember when it ended, in the
    mid 80s, when UK art directors started producing copy-heavy ads with text that
    was small and hugely tracked out."

  body: ">much more to do with technical changes than any art and architecture movements\r\n\r\nI
    agree rather with Bringhurst that general movements in art and architecture are
    indeed very important. The general rule across all design fashions, whether furniture
    or clothes or houses or type, is that each movement is a reaction to the last.
    There is usually more than one reaction, but this principle enables you to understand
    a lot. For example, there are swings back and forth for more and less ornament,
    as people get fed up with too busy designs, and then get tired of too plain ones.
    \r\n\r\nThere was a different feel to blackletter and roman style type. The spread
    of roman over black letter, as documented by Harry Carter, was not due to any
    technical considerations, but religious battles and aesthetic tastes. \r\n\r\nBaskerville,
    if I remember correctly, developed his new inks that would print more cleanly
    in order to achieve the refined neo-classical feeling that he was aiming for--with
    its more circular, broad arches compared to Caslon. The aesthetic drove the technical
    here. And Baskerville's taste was very much of a piece with his times and with
    what was going on in architecture. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, people eventually got fed
    up with the ornate, busy designs of Victorian England, and this ushered in the
    clean all-sans look of modernists in the early 20th century. Political factors
    were also important in the Germanic championing of sans faces. \r\n\r\nOf course
    technology is a very important factor, but the history of type design I don't
    think can be written properly without a large reference to general cultural trends,
    especially in the visual arts. "

    messy typography of new media in the 1890s, and this ushered in the era of Historicism,
    with correct use of historical allusion. The clean all-sans look was only ever
    a high-end, minority phenomenon until the 1960s.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar movement
    now, if you compare the new media of the 1890s with DTP in the 1990s; after the
    crazy boom comes sober conservatism. Except in Newfoundland, of course."

  body: ">you\u2019re more likely to think of a technology\r\n\r\nWhen I was talking
    with Larry Oppenberg at the Museum of Printing, he pointed out that actually the
    typefaces have out-lived the technology. Gardner LePoer there explained that the
    technology has been changing rapidly and continually from 1850, when engines were
    put on presses; it's actually not only a thing of the past thirty years. \r\n\r\nOppenberg
    mentioned that Merg. Linotype had been focused on selling machines, and the typefaces
    were just a means. But in fact the thing that has outlasted the machines and the
    technology is the typefaces. \r\n\r\nGood design has a power to last and is a
    force in itself. Even with screen fonts, it seems to me it is a matter of designers
    seeing how best to adapt what they'd prefer to a limited technology--the low resolution
    screen. And when the screens change, new designs, influenced by the classics,
    will be done again. \r\n\r\nYes, the technology is  extremely important. But the
    message I got from Larry is that in fact those concerned primarily with the technology
    have in the past underestimated the power of good visual design itself.  \r\n\r\nType
    has its own visual logic, which dictates what makes beautiful words and works
    best for reading. And solving this logic well in a typeface is I suspect in the
    long run more important than either changes in publishing technology (screen or
    paper) or tastes in art.   "

    borrow isms from art or technology to explain the sweep of its history.\r\n\r\nHere's
    another: In the early 19th century in the UK and France, a typographic movement
    began which:\r\n1. Got rid of the long s\r\n2. Got rid of c_t and s_t ligatures\r\n3.
    Changed from \"transitional\" to Modern serifed typefaces\r\n4. Invented many
    new genres, including the sans serif\r\n\r\nThis was a widespread, drastic movement
    which should, by rights, be named modernism.\r\nNot a good fit with Romanticism
    or Neoclassicism, the major cultural movements of the time (or at least, as they
    have subsequently been termed), although Robert Bringhurst took a good shot at
    it. Much closer to modern poetry and Wordsworth, with his introduction of simple,
    vernacular language. It must have been quite a bracing experience to read <a href=\"http://etc.dal.ca/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/etc/lballads/img_display.pl?http://etc.dal.ca/lballads/images/London98/98_i.JPG\">Lyrical
    Ballads</a> in 1798, set in a modern type, with no long s's (although the ct is
    still used)."

    and art (with a little bit of physiology and linguistics thrown in for good measure),
    connecting with them all.\r\n\r\nSo on the physiology side of things, there was
    also a Legibility movement: in the early 20th century Morris Benton produced Clearface
    and Century Schoolbook; Cheltenham was also a \"legibility\" face, in the sense
    that its very short descenders and tall ascenders were Goodhue's interpretation
    of the knowledge that the upper parts of letters are more significant in reading.
    Then starting in 1926, Chauncey Griffiths did the Legibility Series of newspaper
    faces at Linotype. \r\n\r\nIt could also be argued that legibility is an aspect
    of functionalism, which would relate those serifed designs just mentioned to the
    development of the 20th century sans serif at the same time. But is it a requirement
    of the types in a movement that they have a similar stylistic look? And do the
    participants in a movement have to be aware that they're in one (and issuing manifestoes),
    or is it OK to just designate it as such from a later point in history?\r\n"
