  (PS), with features such as ligatures, arrows, etc. and it is a latin extended set
  (for PL, SW, etc.).\r\nThis 10 cuts font does work correctly when used directly
  inside Indesign (CS2) temporary fonts.\r\nBUT\r\nwhen i add it in a font manager
  such as FontExplorer or the Apple Font Book, it appears correctly in InDesign but
  makes my whole computer stop (the beautiful colored weel, you know) as soon as i
  use the hand tool to zoom or move inside a page.\r\nWHY?\r\nWHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG?\r\nHELP!\r\n
