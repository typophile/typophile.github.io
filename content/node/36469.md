  for a client; their corporate font is DIN, and (I'm a graphic designer, not a web
  developer - so completely clueless with all things flash) I've been told that it's
  not ideal to use DIN outlined in a flash site (and there are several text popups
  which the client will be managing/updating periodically themselves.)\r\n\r\nIdeally
  I'd like something which has a similar feel to DIN - but certainly would welcome
  any advice...\r\n\r\nMany Thanks... "
