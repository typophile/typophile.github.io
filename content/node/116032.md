body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/65709959_5497.png]\r\n\r\nI'm working on
  a reformat of a report for work, and traced the wordmark in Illustrator.  Now I'm
  trying to find the correct fonts for the two lines below.  Apologies for the poor
  resolution, but the images available online and in the report are of low quality.
  \ For the first line, I've ruled out Bookman Old Style and Copperplate, along with
  many others.  The second line is throwing me off because of the single-storey \"g\".
  \ Tried going through the ID process on Identifont and Fonts.com, but with no luck.
  \ Anyone have any ideas?  Thanks!"
