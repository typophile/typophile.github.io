body: My wife's freelance PR business is taking off and she wants me to work on a
  logo for her. There are a few typefaces I am considering using but I don't own them
  all. I am considering Tartine Script bold and Village's Galaxie Cassiopeia Bold
  (not Basic Bold). If anyone has these, can they type out the word "son" in all lowercase
  at 72pt and email me the Illustrator outlines to david dot nix at dfs dot com? Thanks
  in advance.

    more scripty Bold version.

    sample you are requesting. As you can imagine, I'm not too excited by any request
    for outlines of a specific letter combination of Galaxie Cassiopeia. I didn't
    work on the face for 18+ months to just give it away, in whole, or a letter at
    a time.\r\n\r\nThanks for your interest in the face.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/son_5537.png]"
