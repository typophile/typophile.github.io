  this example on p136 of the Solotype catalog. \r\n\r\nAccording to the Solopedia
  - http://abfonts.freehostia.com/solopedia/solopedia-l.htm -  this font is a match
  for something called 'Bulldog' I cant find this anywhere, wondering if anyone had
  another similar typeface?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs always, may thanks for any assistance...\r\n\r\nM"

  body: Morris Fuller Benton designed a font called Louvaine for ATF in 1929  - three
    weights plus an italic but I can not find a specimen or sample to see if this
    is it - not in my ATF catalogs from the 30s of 40s. The Bulldog font I have seen
    is also close but is much heavier and only close.

  body: "I believe the Solopedia reference is to the Bulldog Foundry - Pat & Paul
    Hickson. There is a listing for \t\r\nLouvaine Bold and Louvaine Eclaire on their
    UK-based digital distributor's website.\r\n\r\n<img>http://www.fontshop.co.uk/preview/P00021999.gif</img>\r\n\r\nPretty
    sure all the Bulldog fonts are just redrawn Solotype materials without the credit
    (and the Solotype often being reproduced from other entity, but that's a different
    story)."

  body: "Louvaine is shown in Jaspert's Enclyopedia of Typefaces, 1970 ed., with the
    three weights. The letter-forms match the Solocat image. The weight of the strokes
    and serifs for all three is a little lighter than shown in the Solocat image.
    Jaspert was unable to find a full character set for any of the three.\r\nAs for
    the Solocat entry, the relative thickness is explained by the source. Dan X. Solo
    scoured the U.S. for used typefaces. The impression of such typefaces could be
    expected to be heavier than the carefully controlled impression of new type in
    a foundry's specimen, or even for the material provided to Jaspert.\r\nDon"

  body: Great lead Don, Full sample character sets are shown in "American Metal Typefaces
    of the 20th Century" by Mac McGrew, Oak Knoll Books 1993 - The font was designed
    in 1928 and issued in 1929 but did not last long enough to appear in the 1934
    ATF catalog. The Bulldog Foundry version seems to be the only digital one.

  body: "More from Jaspert: \"...designed by M.F. Benton, based on a Bodoni model,
    but with the peculiarity found in a number of modernistic types of making the
    thicks and thins meet at an angle. This is especially noticeable in the O and
    the S. The g and y have cursive tails. The italic is the roman inclined, except
    for a, which has a flat-foot serif, v and w. There are three weights, the light
    being the colour of a normal book type.\"\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "McGrew: \"LOUVAINE series was designed by Morris F. Benton for ATF in 1928.
    It is an adaptation of Bodoni (the working title was Modern Bodoni), and many
    of the characters are identical. Only g and y are basically different; otherwise
    the distinction is in the more abrupt transition from thick to thin strokes in
    this series. In this respect, Ultra Bodoni has more affinity to Louvaine than
    to the other Bodoni weights. The three weights of Louvaine correspond to Bodoni
    Book, regular, and Bold. This series did not last long enough to appear in the
    1934 ATF specimen book, the next complete one after its introduction. \"\r\nYes,
    McGrew has full character sets.\r\nDon\r\n"
