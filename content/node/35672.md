body: But I'm stumped. I thought this would be something pretty common -- comes from
  a cheap business card. Looks a bit like a slab serif interpretation of a Goudy,
  but the "e" and "h" are wrong. Anyone recognize it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/weblogocropped_3869.gif]

  body: "Yeah,\r\n\r\nI've substituted Sylfaen for the moment, which isn't quite heavy
    enough but seems to have the correct form. Converting to outlines I can goose
    it, unless someone knows a better alternative for the W."

  body: I don't know of a digital version without the flagged 'W'. I believe this
    'W' was created by hand by the logo designer.
