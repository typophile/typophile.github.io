body: So I finally updated <a href="http://betatype.com">Betatype.com</a>. For the
  time being I'm using it as a project log. I find I'm more motivated to make fonts
  when I share my progress. Feel free to stop by and take a look at what I've been
  working on.

  body: Well done. I think you will only benefit from disclosure, both from the process
    of documenting your work, and the feedback from visitors.
