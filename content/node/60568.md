body: "Hi there\r\n\r\nI just opened up an old InDesign CS2 document, made some edits
  and output a new PDF. In both Acrobat and Foxit Reader some of the edited words
  appear bold where they are not. This affect is much worse when zoomed out, and can't
  be seen when zoomed right in. I don't think it appears in print, but then the only
  printer I have to hand isn't great quality.\r\n\r\nI can't find any difference between
  affected and unaffected text in InDesign. It does look like a rendering issue, as
  if some words have been converted to outlines, but I can't see why this would be.\r\n\r\nIt's
  not a complex document, there are no images, and the problem affects a couple of
  fonts.\r\n\r\nAnyone come across this before?"

  body: Could it be a hinting problem (i.e. fonts not optimized for screen viewing)?
    Is it worse or the same at full magnifications (i.e. 100%, 200% zoom levels)?

  body: "It's a common InDesign bug, unfortunately. You don't mention which version
    you have now; I only saw it once, using CS. Not as yet with CS3 or '4.\r\n\r\nIf
    you examine the PDF in Acrobat Pro or Illustrator, you will find that the phrases
    are doubled, over eachother. Fortunately, it's a problem for screen only, since
    imaging the text twice on a prepress plate maker won't make a difference and hence
    printed output will appear normal.\r\n\r\nSome folks have reported switching off
    \"Export Tagged PDF\" when it was on helped; others claimed the exact opposite.
    I only had it in a multi-lingual book; all phrases in \"other\" languages were
    bolded. IIRC, toggling Tagged did help in that case."

  body: "Not sure why I never came back on this, probably because I was concentrating
    on getting the document, my CV, to a potential employer, but thanks Theunis.\r\n\r\nIt
    was CS2 and while I didn't try toggling Export Tagged PDF, your comment \"I only
    had it in a multi-lingual book; all phrases in \u201Cother\u201D languages were
    bolded\" made me notice that while the document was in UK English, the affected
    text was US English. Probably the result of editing on PCs with different defaults.
    Once corrected, the issue disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe document would have been read
    on screen so the issue would have been rather distracting and not but my skills
    in the best light!\r\n\r\nThanks again -- Elliot.\r\n\r\n"
