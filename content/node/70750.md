  body: "It's a custom logotype, not a typeface. Unless somebody has specifically
    made a typeface to imitate it after the fact, you may have trouble getting very
    close. Those cap \"W's\" are particularly unusual. Perhaps somebody else will
    have some suggestions of typefaces that are at least vaguely similar.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
