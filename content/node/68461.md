  where \"some text\" is the title of existing content or the title of a new piece
  of content to create. You can also link text to a different title by using &#91;&#91;link
  to this title|show this text&#93;&#93;. Link to outside URLs with &#91;&#91;http://www.example.com|some
  text]], or even &#91;&#91;http://www.example.com&#93;&#93;.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhen a
  link is inserted by using this square brackets syntax <strong>and</strong> it is
  not preceded by any other character, the conversion doesn\u2019t take place. See
