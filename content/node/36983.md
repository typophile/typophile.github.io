  body: "Hubert was kind enough to respond to my email. He said that Mommie was finished
    only a year before the cover was done, and so he did not do the cover. He went
    on to say, \"...inspiration for Mommie was a calligraphy by Tony Di Spigna. For
    me the Spencerian Hand was quite new.\"\r\n\r\nRecently I have been taking a deep
    look into the art of cursive type. I'm not only interested in the technical aspects,
    but also its history and in the way one can 'style' the medium too.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.iampeth.com/index.htm\r\nhttp://www.iampeth.com/artwork.htm"

  body: The lettering is by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deanne_Cheuk">Deanne
    Cheuk</a>. The credit appears on page 6, at the foot of the table of contents.
    The drop caps for most of the stories in this issue were handlettered by Ms. Cheuk
    as well.
