  \xED \u012D \u01D0 \xEE \xEF \xEC \u012B \u0129 \u0135\r\nBut should I kern between
  themselves? Since while it would take a lot of time, I don't think there's that
  much combos involving 2 accents apart from one I know: Ukrainian double \xEF\xEF.
  \r\nIs there any more?"

    of the Native American languages, African languages, etc. As type now supports
    more and more diacriticals, more and more authors start using them.\r\n\r\nDon't
    know if this helps, but one thing I do with the i-accents is to give then a bit
    larger setwidth (sidebearings). And not all the same, use whatever works best
    with individual characters.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes a slightly shorter macron, a
    slightly condensed caron, circumflex, dieresis, etc. You can put them up alongside
    a vowel with unmodified accents in the metrics window, and if a difference isn't
    objectionable when you view it at at 120 points, it will likely pass muster,\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    yes, you need to kern. Or do what so many others do, let the typesetter do it. "
