body: "I\u2019m looking to get my certification in Adobe Illustrator as a way to help
  pad my resume and squeeze some more money out of work (they give raises for certifications).
  I just want to know what training materials would be helpful to prepare. As I understand
  it, these Adobe exams are similar to the Microsoft Certifications in that there
  are two answers that are \u201Ctechnically\u201D right for each question, but only
  one is the \u201CAdobe\u201D way. I need something that will give me a stronger
  grasp of the \u201CAdobe\u201D way. Thanks a ton!"

  body: Like I said, a means to an end. The "Adobe" way, like the "Microsoft" way,
    has a tendency to be tedious and long-handish, though I think the idea is that
    it saves time over the long haul. I certainly wouldn't expect people to hire someone
    because they have good workflow. Again, being certified looks good on a resume,
    but mostly I'm gunning for a bit of a raise.

  body: Yeah, Adobe was the first place I went. I guess I'm really just looking for
    perspectives from people who may have taken Adobe exams. Like what Adobe materials
    they found to be most useful.

  body: "I took the Photoshop exam, but many years ago. I didn't find anything that
    hit \"the Adobe Way\" but there were questions that expected you to know what
    the menu item for Copy was, and under what menu, even though everyone knows that
    Ctrl/Cmd C will get you there without knowing anything about the menus.\r\n\r\nAs
    for training, I downloaded the exam learning objectives, which were about eight
    pages, maybe 50 to 100 objectives, and then went through each objective and made
    sure I could do exactly what it wanted me to be able to do. (I should have expanded
    that to be \"do exactly what it wanted me to be able to do ... in every way possible\").\r\n\r\nI
    think back then it cost me $150 to take the exam. This investment has resulted
    in a net gain of $0 income to me in the 10/12 years since. (I was certified in
    Photoshop 5 ... and I think they are in Photoshop 11 now)."

  body: Gotcha. Thanks for the perspective. The only reason I'm taking the test is
    for the guaranteed raise, I fully understand it doesn't really say anything about
    my worth as a person or as a designer.
