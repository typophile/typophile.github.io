    (hand-drawn).\r\n\r\nIs this from a book or some other printed matter? Any details
    about the source, especially its year of publication, would help.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nNever
    mind, found it myself:\r\nhttp://www.paperwonderland.co.nz/products/crafters-workshop-template-6x6-live-love-laugh.html\r\n\r\nDefinitely
    hand-drawn (all the repeating letters are different)."

  body: "Always nice to be assumed ignorant than to have left out the word \u201Cor\u201D
    before hand-drawn in the first sentence of my post.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2026the art
    or procedure of arranging type\" is how my dictionary defines typography, and
    in the digital age the definition of type as \"printed characters or letters\"
    is a bit outdated\u2014given that ebooks, web sites, and apps don\u2019t involve
    the transfer of text, images or designs to paper.\r\n\r\nBut if it makes you happy
    to be such pedantic cusses, by all means knock yourselves out."
