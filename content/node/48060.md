  few years back before my computer crashed and I lost all my fonts. I'm pretty sure
  that it was a free font that I downloaded around 2003-2004. When I go into the Properties/Font
  window in Mediaface (CD labeling software), it says that the font is \"Sleepwalk,\"
  but I can't find anything by that name and it didn't offer any substitutes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sleepwalk_4217.jpg]"

  body: "Or Arial Rounded Bold\r\n\r\nProbably neither one, because the top of the
    t angles down,\r\non Arial and Helvetica Rounded, it's a rounded tip.\r\n\r\nBut
    these could substitute."

    close, but not quite!
