  on a website touting great usage of vintage typography and liked it. Searching google

    aka Super Furry.

  body: "Definitely not a font. Simon Walker's lettering. Looks like stiff old Times
    Roman poured into a vortex to end up as a charming toilet paper lettering. To
    duplicate it, apply the buttery vertical strokes found in fonts like FF Tartine
    \ Script http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/tartine-script/ or Aspic http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/alias/aspic/
    to the letters of your choice add ball terminals, do swooshing and you are there.\r\nDon "

    such.\r\n\r\nIf not, I may go with one of the fonts you linked to. They're close...oh
    so close."

  body: "You're welcome. For what it is worth, fonts with these fat syrupy softened
    strokes are popular for dairy, yoghurt, toilet paper and other packaged products
    where a smooth friendly brand is sought. Any of these names are used for the font
    category.\r\nDon"

    Super. I can't seem to quit it, no matter how hard I try. \r\n\r\nNow I gotta
    try to learn how to warp fonts. Oy!"

  body: I find the best way create type like this is grab a pencil and sketch it out.
    Scan it in and work over it. Then the type will work exactly as you want it to.
