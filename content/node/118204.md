  of similar looking fonts out there but \r\nI wanted to see if anyone knows what
  exactly these are. \r\n\r\nThe \"Continental\" font and the \"Dress for the Night\"
  are 2 different fonts. \r\n\r\nthanks!!!"

  body: I think Dress for the Night is also Elephant with some screenblurring of the
    serifs.

  body: "Actually I took a look. The lower case \"a\" in \"want\" doesn't match the
    a in Elephant. \r\nNeither fonts have a curl at the end of the lower case a. \r\n"

  body: heres a clearer look at the a. I do think they used Elephant in the issue
    for some of the smaller stuff.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_4065.JPG]

  body: I have looked further but can not find anything to match your better sample
    Lance, it may be custom as Kevin pointed out - as close as I can get is still
    Elephant and as your sample shows the serifs are wrong.

    per weight.
