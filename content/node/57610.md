body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nWondering if you could help me find this font. This one
  will be difficult as it was printed in 1897 in Britain. The journal was called Cosmopolis.
  The poem, as you probably already know is by St\xE9phane Mallarm\xE9.\r\n\r\nI am
  so curious!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.information-office.org/mallarme/uncoupdejour.png"

  body: "Nah, that's a different design. Look at the way the endings of the \"C\"
    and \"S\" are cut at an angle in your sample but aren't in Coliseum, for one thing.
    Also, the \"E\"s have much larger serifs, and the weight distribution on the \"N\"
    is different.\r\n\r\nThe question is going to be whether the font in your sample
    has survived, i.e. if there is a digital version of it. Maybe the guys with the
    nice type specimen books can help shed some light on this."

  body: "If you look at the C in the sample and Coliseum, I think you will see they
    are not a match. I think your sample is more like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/runic-mt/|Runic
    Condesned]], which is based on 19th century woodcut designs, it says.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Flipping through Jaspert's \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\" comes up with
    a typeface called Etienne, with the statement \"probably a Wagner & Schmidt face
    of 1902\". Etienne looks almost exactly like Runic Condensed, which Monotype released
    in 1935.\r\n\r\nTo me the problem is that both Etienne/Runic seem more condensed
    than your sample, and the likely answer is that there is another typeface that
    was similar to them that we have not found yet. My books get real skimpy going
    back past the 20th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    similar DNA.\r\n\r\nWould love to find the real thing."

  body: "It turns out I have versions of both Etienne and Runic Condensed. [Etienne
    is shown as \"Enge Etienne\" in the Phil's Photo book, and NovelFonts made a version
    called \"Engine\", which I have]. In this image, I widened both fonts to 175%,
    and flattened Runic Condensed to 90% of its normal height.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly,
    this is 'fudging', but in the absence of the actual typeface, which may not have
    been digitized, I think these are pretty close.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uncoupdedesSIM_4117.gif]"
