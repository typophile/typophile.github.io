body: "Hey There! I'm looking for some possibly life changing advice, so I'd greatly
  appreciate it if you could read my post and offer whatever thoughts you may have.
  Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nLet me give you a quick run down on my life.\r\n\r\nI'm
  20. After high-school I went to university for graphic design, but hating it, I
  dropped out after only the first year. For the next two years [to present], I've
  worked as a freelance web-designer. Now I'm thinking about the future. Freelance
  is unstable. I'd like to find work with a studio, but I have no idea how, where
  to begin, or whether I am qualified or skilled enough.\r\n\r\nI'll link you to my
  portfolio so you can keep it in mind as you read the rest.\r\nwww.skywide.net\r\n\r\n\r\nMy
  question to you is: How does one go about finding their first full-time graphic
  design job?\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no full-time working experience. My resume consists
  of a scattering of freelance positions with a variety of individuals, organizations,
  and a few running overflow agreements with some local studios. I do have a few strong
  references.\r\n\r\nIs it generally accepted that studios/organizations only hire
  people who've completed university or college programs?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I need to
  do some sort of internship?\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at my website and offer honest
  feedback. Do I even stand a chance? Is my portfolio varied enough? Is it what employers
  are looking for?\r\n\r\nReally, whatever advice you have to give would probably
  be helpful.\r\n\r\nI have little interest in going back to university to complete
  my design degree [citing reasons such as insane tuition costs, lack of actual learning.],
  but it is an option...\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBlake"

  body: "Okay, I'm only two years out of school, so take my advice with a grain of
    salt:\r\n\r\nI'd say you have a good start, especially considering you have almost
    no formal training. The majority of your work looks pretty \"safe,\" and seems
    to be very ad-company-ish, but there is obviously a lot of thought going into
    them. I would be curious to know in what capacity and how much of these websites
    are yours, and how much other team members contributed. I particularly like the
    design on \"warfare grounds\" and theillest.com, as they seem to have a little
    more personality.\r\n\r\nI have a hard time saying don't go to school, but you
    may be okay. I'm not nearly in a position to tell you what employers are looking
    for, but I would have to say most creative firms have a \"proof is in the pudding\"
    philosophy. A BFA from RISD would certainly help your resum\xE9, but I think what
    matters most is your portfolio. Depending on what languages of code you know,
    that will help bolster you as well. Java and Flash Actionscripting are a huge
    plus, but maybe you should here from someone who isn't a print designer...\r\n\r\nIf
    you are an AIGA member, they have excellent networking events. Creative hotlist
    and coroflot.com may be good places to start looking for jobs as well."

    and take full credit for everything you see on my website. \r\n\r\nThe problem
    I've found with freelancing is that the people who are willing to pay well, aren't
    interested in taking risks. That's why a lot of my more recent projects have been
    pretty simple and safe, unlike some of my older more fun designs.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is AIGA all about?\r\n\r\nThanks for the helpful comment, very much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames

    $310, which may be a little steep on a tight budget, but like I said, they have
    great networking events, discounts on admission to some galleries/museums, great
    lectures as well as some exclusive job listings (aiga.org).\r\n\r\nJames is right,
    if you have all that coding skill, you should find a job relatively easily, at
    least compared to a print designer.\r\n\r\nBest of luck!"

    design is a bit different. They're not quite as picky as to specific degrees,

  body: "Blake, you've worked with clients (which is a good thing to have under your
    belt) but have no formal training (no degree makes it harder). If you want to
    work for an agency/ firm, I think you're on the mark when you suggested an internship
    or a junior position. Unless you are a design prodigy, you'll have to prove yourself
    and build your resume for larger, more stable stuff. With web design, I gather
    it's all about technical skills when you're starting out.\r\n\r\nYour work has
    solidity and variety, but lacks a certain spark and depth which usually comes
    from experience and collaboration with a team. My advice is to hit AIGA's site,
    craigslist, Coroflot, and anywhere else you can find to seek out openings.\r\n\r\n(disclaimer:

  body: "Hi I always find it amazing people trying to find a quick fix or a short-cut.
    Nothing really comes for free and the only way to get there is by doing it...
    don't wait for hand outs. Hard work or putting yourself on the line, by just doing
    it... \r\n\r\nYou are only 20!!!...  if you think you need more design discipline
    or skills go back to design school NOW... take from it what you want, be motivated
    and inspired by others as they too may be inspired by you. 4-5 years now to get
    that dream job (maybe) is worth it... unless you are so talented that an agency
    will head hunt you and put you in a great role of creative... ... it's not going
    to happen.\r\n\r\nHard work, put yourself out there... get noticed... go back
    to school or get a job as a junior or a mac op.... because once you are in an
    agency, the foot is already well in the door. \r\n\r\nFreelance as a mac op via
    design recruitment/HR/freelance company, though they will want to know history
    and will test you on your skills, once in they can get you temporary positions
    freelancing at small to large agencies. \r\n\r\nA problem for graduates is that
    no-one wants a graduate without real agency experience, how is a graduate supposed
    to get real experience if no-one is willing to take them on?... thats where the
    internships help out I guess.\r\n\r\nin your case you have had real experience
    in web, so I would be using that, it is your 'in' your foot in the door.. or go
    to a company like Aquent (example only)... or bang on every door.\r\n\r\nGo back
    to design school and do an internship at the same time... maybe pick another school...
    remembering you quit design school, so an employer may think \"this person may
    quit us?\"... \r\n\r\nThe future is yours... play hard and have fun\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Blake,\r\nMy most important advice to you: Make sure it's you who determines
    what direction you'd like to take in your career. Talking with others may help;
    but ultimately the desire must be discovered inside you.\r\nI studied computer
    science for three years in college before finally coming to grips with the idea
    that\u2014while I liked it, and was good at it\u2014I didn't love it. It would
    have been a safe career path for me, and I could have done what I really loved
    on the side; but I decided to change direction so I could work at what I love
    full-time.\r\nMaybe you're sticking with web design because you feel like it's
    a safe path; but I assume that you're wondering what's next\u2014meaning you're
    not truly fulfilled with where you're at presently. Find within yourself what
    kind of work you would eventually love to do everyday. For me it's type design
    and print design. I've still got a way to go before type design can be the primary
    focus of my professional life every single day, but that's what I'm working toward.\r\nYou're
    good enough to get contracts working in web design, but you might love working
    with animals or making music or teaching history for all we know.\r\nSo try a
    lot of things; meet a lot of different kinds of people. But make sure it's you
    who decides where you want to end up. Then follow your passion for it and you'll
    get there."
