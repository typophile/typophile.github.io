body: "Hey!\r\nI am having trouble finding the right (meaning cheap) cjk font for
  a client and I was wondering if anyone already had the same problem (and solved
  it). ;-)\r\nThe fonts I am looking for will be used digitally on embedded devices,
  as webfont and for apps and software. \r\nSo the question is, are there any free
  cjk fonts for commercial use avaliable? Probably not, but just in case...\r\nAfter
  researching the web, it seems that all the smaller foundies are getting the same
  cjk fonts from one of the big global foundries. Does it make sense to ask a whole
  bunge of foundries around the globe? Should I ask an asian foundry? Are there any
  price ranges? And if so, what's the best way to getting a cheap font?\r\nI've already
  sent enquiries to the big foundries and was wondering if that's the right way to
  do it. ;-)\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nSiggi"

  body: "What language in are you looking for?  CJK fonts generally have to be tuned
    for one of Japanese, Korean, Traditional or Simplified Chinese, as each language
    expects slightly different forms of certain characters.  \r\n\r\nFor various CJK
    fonts, check the 'East Asia' page at http://www.unifont.org/fontguide/\r\n\r\nFor
    Japanese in particular, http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Japanese.html has a number
    of free & open source fonts.\r\n\r\nAlso Japanese, a set of nice sans-serif (\u30B4\u30B7\u30C3\u30AF)

  body: "Perhaps you can check [[http://www.dynacw.com/|Dynacomware]] and [[http://www.foundertype.com/|Founder
    Type]] for traditional and simplified Chinese fonts.\r\n\r\nOh, and there is also
    [[www.arphic.com/|Arphic]].\r\n\r\nThere is only one usable Open Source simplified
    Chinese font out there: DroidSansFallback.ttf, which is in a sans-serif style
    (which should be no surprise given its name!). Arphic also contributed some, but
    at least I don't think they should be used to typeset simplified Chinese blindly,
    as I spotted a few glyphs in styles that's not accepted in mainland China.\r\n"
