body: "I am helping a friend ( who is a product design student) put together a document
  about his internship at Renault. The document mainly talks about how he went about
  designing a new car\u2026 right from research to his final concepts for the car.
  The car is more of a \u2018concept car\u2019 and not a car that you would see on
  the roads too soon. I would be grateful if you guys could suggest fonts that might
  work well for the body text and for the headings of such a document. I hope the
  information I have provided is enough for you to help me out with your suggestions.
  \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n"

    go for the Le Monde typeface? http://www.typofonderie.com/

  body: "The audience would be a fairly mixed one. This document would be read by
    his teachers and later by other students, mainly product design students, at our
    institute ( The National Institute of Design, India). A copy of the document would
    also go to Renault\u2026 but I doubt if the top brass would read it though. So
    I\u2019d consider design students to be the main audience."

  body: "Thank you, sii, for the suggestion and the link. Cartype.com is an interesting
    site indeed. \r\n\r\nBpotstra thanks for the link but it throws up an error message
    when I try to access it. Are you sure its cartype.org? Or maybe there is something
    wrong with my connection at the moment.\r\n"
