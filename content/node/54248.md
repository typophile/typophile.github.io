  eliminate the apostrophe. Particularly the possessive. It all started, apparently,
  with Birmingham city council in the UK deciding to drop it from all road signage
  in the city.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nI'll miss it!"

    none of the road signs use them. \r\nWe have recently rebranded a local school
    and were over ruled by the board of governors on the use of the possessive in
    the logo, which we found amusing as the school was holding a spelling bee competition
    shortly after it reopened."

  body: "Plenty of people have lamented the disappearing possessive apostrophe. Nothing
    new there.\r\n\r\nBUT . . . let's keep in mind that this lack may be offset by
    the far too frequent addition of an apostrophe where none is needed. Many folks
    think one is needed to make a noun plural. This sentence just came around in an
    internal e-mail:\r\n\r\n\"The Parking Booth will continue to be staffed on Monday\u2019s.\"\r\n\r\nSo
    perhaps the world supply of apostrophes will remain stable thanks to both correct
    and incorrect use.\r\n\r\npowers"

    supply of apostrophi? Technically incorrect I'm sure, but it sounds good :)

  body: 'I think <em>apostrophe</em> is Greek, like <em>ephemera</em>. I once saw
    an article (in the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>, no less) that used
    the word <em>ephemerae</em>, thus affixing a bogus Latin plural ending to a Greek
    word that was already plural. '

  body: Speaking of oddities -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- but those of us who
    use English are accustomed to words of Greek origin with an "f" sound being spelled
    with a "ph". As in 'philosophy'. Now the Germanic languages allow an "f" in these
    words. But why a mix, as in <cite>filosophy</cite>?

    how important proper punctuation could be, when an attorney misplaced a comma
    in a contract with a company that agreed to lay Rogers\u2019s cables across the
    Maritimes. A Canadian court said ignorance of correct punctuation was no excuse
    and invalidated what was believed to be an ironclad five-year contract. That errant
