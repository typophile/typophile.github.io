body: "Does anyone know of a way of storing TrueType outlines as human-readable ASCII
  text that could be easily translated to and from a <code>'glyf'</code> table bytecode?
  Similar to how PostScript Type 1 code can be assembled/disassembled with Type 1
  Utilities or Adobe's FDK. There's of course TTX or GLIF, but I myself wouldn't count
  that, as they don\u2019t read nor play well in standard Unix toolchain and versioning
  systems."

    this is the answer to a different question than 'What is the ideal archive format
    for a digital typeface design?', so we should be clear what we're asking about,
    and why.\r\n\r\nI'm still haunted by the memory of standing in the non-Latin archive
    room at Linotype when it was being prepared for transfer to the University of
    Reading, and looking at the shelves of archive tape media of early digital type,
    realising that there were no machines that could read the tapes. [At Reading,
    Gerry Leonidas was able to track down a company that still makes the special filing
    cabinets to hold the large hanging files used for Linotype's paper drawings; I
    think the tapes were junked.]\r\n\r\n\r\n* The sfnt table structure seems to me
    such an obviously good source format. It enables you to store most data natively
    in the target font format, and if you want to store independent source data, e.g.
    visual hints, you can always include private tables that can be read by font tools.
    This is how VTT and VOLT already work: the .ttf is the source file, and the tool
    data is stored in private tables until the font is 'shipped'. The Microsoft math
    font tool goes one better, and simply writes and reads the MATH table directly,
    which seems a good option for any tool that doesn't need to present the user with
    data that isn't written to the final font tables."

    essentially defines a *transformation path* from the binary SFNT structure to
    human-readable XML, and back. And, after all, it is the binary SFNT structure
    that remains *canonical* in terms of the specification. The .ttx format is, and
    will remain, dependent on the binary structure \u2014 not the other way around.
    \r\n\r\nContrary to what Grzegorz suggests, fontTools/TTX is being maintained.
    The SFNT structure doesn't change much, because the OpenType font format doesn't
    change hugely. But whenever a new version of the OpenType format was published,
    fontTools/TTX was typically patched quite quickly. Adobe have been using fontTools/TTX
    extensively in AFDKO, and contributed a lot of code to fontTools/TTX. So in fact,
    if you use Adobe FDK for OpenType, you're using fontTools/TTX already anyway.
    \r\n\r\nOne great missing thing of relevance today is fontTools/TTX modules (and
    therefore the .ttx format) for the AAT tables. Apart from that, all is well supported.

    tools while .ttx works with \"dumb\" tools. I.e. the transformation from .ufo
    to a final font requires a complex toolchain and there is no straightforward path
    which would guarantee that one .ufo would give you a particular .otf or .ttf.
    In other words, .ufo operates on an abstract level, and lots of information that
    has to go into .otf or .ttf is not included in .ufo, and therefore needs to be
    \"invented\" by the tool. On the other hand, .ttx operates on a lower level, and
    really is a very straightforward representation of .otf or .ttf. In other words,
    one could have a very different tool for compiling .ttx into .otf/.ttf, written
    in a different language -- but the results of the conversion would be the same.
    So the .ttx-to-.ttf process really is a straightforward combination, and it's
    a *stable* process. The .ufo-to-.ttf conversion is, well, something like going
    from HTML to PDF \u2014\_lots of decisions need to happen in the software and
    those decisions are not \"stable\" in the sense of \"not predetermined\". \r\n\r\nFor
    example, the same .ufo will yield you very different .ttf files depending on what
    software you use to convert (FontForge, Glyphs, RoboFont, TransType 4). But that's
    the nature of .ufo, as it's intended to be high-level, and deliberately leaves

    indeed are yet unbeaten technology if we consider, well, markup \u2014 description
    of documents of mixed content and loose structure. But using a markup-like language
    for describing plain data is an overkill both syntactically and processing-wise.
    I suppose XML is being used almost instinctively because of its familiarity and
    the parsers available in most programming languages out there, but this doesn\u2019t
    mean it\u2019s always a best choice for a given problem domain. Think the XML
    vs. JSON debate from a few years back.\r\n\r\nGiven the open architecture of the
    <code>sfnt</code>, I can imagine a development format that would involve all the
    basic, or native, languages for each type of technology being used in a font.
    That would be:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Type 2 Charstring for PostScript outlines</li>\r\n<li>the
    feature file language for OpenType Layout</li>\r\n<li>respective input files of
    AAT and Graphite technologies.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThey are all great for hand
    editing, machine parsing, versioning and storage, and they all compile directly
    and losslessly into the font binary. These files and their compilers could give
    a basic, very reliable and flexible workflow. Different kind of programs, either
    filter-like or more abstract editors, could be built on top of that and used interchangeably.
    In fact, that\u2019s exactly what UFO got right originally: a set of separate,
    domain-specific files. But it fell short with GLIF and Property Lists: a weak
    outline format, and a can of worms in <em>ad hoc</em> plist data, respectively.
    Swap all this for a native \u201Clanguage\u201D for the core TrueType tables,

    a very good representation of the OpenType Layout tables. There are many things

    generalizations and unifications which obscure the underlying complexities of
    the binary font data. And there are many many cases where the same binary situation
    can be expressed in a huge number of ways using FEA. \r\n\r\nAdobe's makeotf compiler
    adds additional limits, since it does not \"understand\" many aspects of FEA.
    FontForge's implementation is marginally better is some aspects, but worse in
    others. But that's a different point of discussion. \r\n\r\nI use FEA all the
    time, and I love it, most of the time. But it's not an exhaustive format. It makes
    it easy to develop OTL in 95% of cases, but really hard in the remaining 5%. \r\n\r\n.ttx
    is actually much better in that regard. It follows the OTL structure closely,
    and you can express more with it than with FEA. At the same time, of course, .ttx
    is more awkward to work with, well, because OTL is a bit awkward. :)\r\n\r\nFEA
    has of course its merits. It gives simplicity to what is actually inside a rather
    complex structure (OTL binary tables, that is). But by allowing, or applying the
    simplification, it sometimes obscures or even malforms some of the complexities.
    \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, FEA got a bit better over the years. Initially, it was almost
    just a \"prototyping\" language for OTL. These days, it's allows for more control,
    but still leaves a large undefined area, which a tool needs to fill. In other
    words, it's not a fully explicit format. Different tools that compile FEA to OTL
    will yield different results. In that sense, it's more akin to UFO. \r\n\r\nFEA

    be focusing too much on the color of the summer jacket. I mean, we're looking
    for a suitable piece of clothing for the right climate. Let's say SFNT is chilly
    summer weather. The .ttx format may have a somewhat out-of-fashion color or stylization,
    but at least it is a summer jacket. It's not a winter jacket nor a bathing suit.
    It is a good summer jacket, actually, it fits well and does the job. OK, it may
    be a bit out of fashion now \u2014 but is fashion a good criterion for making
    such choices?\r\n\r\n.ttx was created in the time when XML was \"the new thing\"
    and was thought to be \"a great method to express everything in human-readable
    text form\". Sure, we do know now that it may not be a perfect fit for everything,
    and perhaps a different notation could be *marginally* better for a human-readable
    source form of SFNT. \r\n\r\nBut it really *is* good. When developing fontTools/TTX,
    Just van Rossum put *a lot* of thought into the best possible representation of
    various SFNT fields, and I agree with like 99.5% of his choices. I like .ttx much
    more than .ufo. I feel that .ufo overuses the .plist concept, which may be simpler
    to process but is not very readable. All those \"key\"/\"array\" alternations
    \u2014 they don't read well, and are just meaningless overhead. \"Key key key
    key\", \"array array array array\". That could be expressed much more elegantly
    in something simpler, like JSON. \r\n\r\nBut with .ttx, it's different. I do like
    the fact that the element names are meaningful, that in most cases data is expressed
    using elements rather than attributes, because it allows to visualize the ordering
    of various SFNT data structures very closely. \r\n\r\nLet me put it this way:
    for years, I could not make sense of what SFNT looks like. I did not understand
    the format, I could not visualize it in my head. The moment I decompiled a .ttf
    into .ttx using fontTools/TTX, I had a revelation. I finally got it. Within an
    instance. I only had such a moment once before, when I understood how computers
    work after learning some simple 6502 assembler in Atari 130XE :) \r\n\r\n.ttx
    has been used in many many projects by a large number of font developers. It's
    been tested with thousands of fonts (actually, tens of thousands). fontTools/TTX
    is practically bug-free and very, very stable. The data structure for each table
    is very well designed, it follows the SFNT structure quite natively, with just
    a few exceptions, where they actually make sense. \r\n\r\nIt even makes sense
    that it uses ISO 8859-1 rather than UTF-8 (really, it does). \r\n\r\nIt's certainly
    not a \"self-compiling\" format, i.e. it does not provide all the inherent structure
    within the data (so that the compiler could be completely \"stupid\" and the same
    routine could work for all tables). Perhaps you're looking for something like
    that? I don't know. \r\n\r\nAs I said, apart from some missing tables, for which
    support would be hugely welcome, and better documentation \u2014 both the fontTools/TTX
    and .ttx are actually close to perfection. Just van Rossum is a very modest man,
    but I think his development of fontTools/TTX and the .ttx format stand among the
    greatest achievements within font technology. Thanks to Python, it works everywhere,
    is easy and elegant to work with. In fact, the seemingly low maintenance of the
    code these days can really be attributed to its stability. Most \"biggies\" are
    done, all small things are also done, and it just works. \r\n\r\nThere are a few
    things that aren't done, they're all \"biggies\" \u2014 like AAT support. Since
    Apple is currently the largest computer company, the worldwide deployment of AAT
    \"consuming\" platforms is quite huge (especially due to iOS). When fontTools/TTX
    was started, the importance of AAT was marginal, and OpenType Layout was seemingly
    the only thing of interest. Today, it's much less so. So I'd be very grateful
    if anyone stepped up and contributed AAT support to fontTools/TTX. \r\n\r\nBut
    other than that \u2014 I personally think that developing \"something completely
    different\" from scratch to rival with .ttx is a waste of energy. Again, this
    is just my personal view. \r\n\r\n.ttx does the job, is a very good low-level
    source format that compiles into SFNT natively, works well with versioning systems,
    is well designed, elegant, easily readable (among the easiest XML formats I know),
    solid, stable, and \u2014 in my personal opinion \u2014 rather beautiful. \r\n\r\nIf
    Just van Rossum is reading this \u2014 Just, I can say to you again what I've
    said several times: thank you, thank you, and once again, thank you. This piece
    of software you've written has allowed me to do things with fonts that I would
    have otherwise not been able to achieve. On countless occasions. \r\n\r\nRoger,\r\nA."

    Font Tools and TTX, and what Adam says about its specifics is indeed true. But
    the very choice of XML at its core is arguable not only in terms of a particular
    hype, or aesthetics, or even the difference in readability, but also in terms
    of some syntactic problems.\r\n\r\nXML is a tree-like structure, whereas font
    binaries are not: they are flat arrays with offsets and such. For example, there\u2019s
    a common optimization method within <code>'cmap'</code> or <code>'name'</code>
    table, where two different entires make an offset to the same exact data (or even
    part of it) deeper in the table. Try representing that in XML without bending
    around the syntax at the level of a misuse. It\u2019s just not adequate for the
    job and we end up with details that are lost in translation. That these are details
    doesn\u2019t make it an issue that can easily be ignored, because you recompile
    a font, run a <code>diff</code>, see something has changed, and wonder what else
    could go wrong.\r\n\r\nNow if we move away from an XML representation, Python
    doesn\u2019t seem like an obvious choice any longer, either. Therefore my opinion
    is that putting effort to improve TTX is not so promising as it seems. This of
    course doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not good or usable, because it certainly is.
    It\u2019s just not <em>good enough</em> in hard-core font production.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the feature file syntax, I must admit that I haven\u2019t dug through OpenType
    Layout tables thoroughly enough, so I might be wrong about it after all. I\u2019ve
    thought that using the syntax in its most explicit form (that is, defining rules
    in lookups of one kind, referring them in features, setting language systems to
    each feature, etc.) will translate pretty losslessly to the structures inside
    the tables, won\u2019t it?\r\n\r\nRestrictive syntax that\u2019s close to the
    way binary itself is structured, and accompanying stupid compiler are worthy in
    general. More stupid compiler means more optimizations have to be made at the
    syntax level, resulting in better source files for you and others to employ. It
    would also mean that you would have to learn and understand the technology rather
    well, and that\u2019s a good thing in the end. Making the compiler stupid would
    also make it more deterministic and thus more reliable. (Still, an ideal compiler
    would be just smart enough to give you some hints how to optimize your code, but
    sufficiently stupid not to do it on its own discretion.)"

    it essentially is a \"schema\" for the GSUB table in a plain-text form. And then,
    an actual example GSUB table definition would be (also an excerpt): \r\n\r\n<code>GSUBHeader

    \ \r\n[...]</code>\r\nand so on. \r\n\r\nThis is very low-level, in fact the assembly
    level. I don't know how many .fmt schemas Microsoft created and for how many tables,
    but this \"language\" that Microsoft created could be used and extended in an
    opensource tool. \r\n\r\nAn alternative might be an approach similar to Pomax's,
    who authored a generic \"binary parser generator\", and then defined a language
    for binary parsers, where, as one example, he created a parser spec for the OpenType
    font format: \r\nhttps://github.com/Pomax/A-binary-parser-generator\r\nhttps://github.com/Pomax/A-binary-parser-generator/blob/master/OpenType.spec\r\n\r\nThis
    approach could be refined and turned into a \"converter\", with text-to-binary
    and binary-to-text conversion. In a way, Pomax's OpenType.spec format description
    is rather similar to Microsoft's .fmt description for tools. \r\n\r\nOf course
    the \"big question\" when inventing such a format is the typical one: what delimiters
    should be used, what to do with whitespace, etc. etc. I guess one reason why people
    choose XML these days is because there, these questions are simply ANSWERED (and
    very well specified). So even though XML may not be the best format for a particular
    usage scenario, it's a well-defined one and they don't need to start a debate
    about what the \"ideal\" format should be. :) With your project, a debate will
    surely start if you propose some kind of notation (e.g. similarly \"looking\"
    to Microsoft's TTOAsm, or to Pomax's parser format, or to the Adobe FEA structure
    or to the Adobe AFM structure or to the plain-text Type 1 form, or to Ikarus or
    to whatever else, or you come up with your own). Some people will \"like it\",
    others will \"hate it\", others will \"like it but propose improvements\", others
    will \"like it as it was before the improvements but not now\". :)\r\n\r\nSo,
    as it's often the case, the probably biggest value of XML is that it exists at
    all :D There is a big community of tools, schemas, workflows, \"best practices\"
    etc. around it, which people can cherry-pick rather than invent their own. The
    same can be said, I guess, about things like PHP. PHP is not a really good language,
    but it's easy to deploy because you don't have to invent a lot of things :)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam"

    in a readable form, or want to adjust a single value while leaving everything
    else intact, then a close-to-binary non-binary representation might be a good
    thing. But when making fonts, this is hardly relevant and may even turn out to
    be an obstacle, because a designer does not want to change a individual piece
    of information and rather do some design adjustment which causes a couple of pieces
    of information to change.\r\n\r\nFor example, is it really necessary that a non-binary
    representation of <em>glyf</em> precisely reflects how x, y and point type are
    packaged? I don't think so because, while using flags to save some space, the
    information relevant for rendering shapes remains the same. Similarly, whether
    you use PPF1 or PPF2 subtables to store metrics adjustments in <em>GPOS</em> is
    irrelevant as to the information they hold, though one my save some space compared
    to the other.\r\n"

    (Pomax simply never stops to amaze me). This indeed is low as it can be, lower
    and more verbose than anything I thought of, but it\u2019s good to have it as
    an option, plus already mentioned VOLT sources, which I must look into.\r\n\r\nKarsten,
    yes, such tools would be of questionable utility to many designers indeed. Still,
    they are intended primarily for post-production and engineering side of things,
    where all this could matter. It\u2019s not only about space savings (though that\u2019s
    important these days), but also about performance, and about doing tricks that
    push the technology to its extremes, either for testing purposes or for producing
    non-standard or special-purpose fonts. And, as Adam mentioned briefly, it\u2019s
    often the best way to learn to think in terms of font internals, what I believe
    makes you build better fonts in general.\r\n\r\nIf I recall correctly, Dave Crossland
    once said that he would like to see a standard build environment for font development,
    a kind of <code>./configure; make; make install</code> for fonts. That would be
    another perspective why it would be really good to have some concise and effective,
    not too low-level, but still deterministic languages for font production."

  body: "Here are two illustrations why TrueType outline\u2019s binary data would
    make a distinct textual representation, and how it could be useful.\r\n\r\nFirst.
    In the binary, each coordinate have corresponding bit flags telling about its
    properties. Particular combination of those flags indicate, for example, that
    a coordinate is stored as a single byte (a short version), or as two bytes (long).
    In an ideal situation all coordinates that could be stored as single bytes would
    be stored as so, and the rest would be stored as two bytes. In that case, a textual
    disassembler could make those default assumptions and represent the point (an
    off-curve one) simply as:\r\n\r\n<strong>point off</strong> x y</code>\r\n\r\nBut
    some font editors or converters could make a lousy job of this optimization (as
    few system fonts on my machine I\u2019ve tested happen to have it wrong with offsets
    in the compound glyphs). In that case the point would have a hint (or a cast if
    you prefer) and therefore look like this:\r\n\r\n<strong>point off (x-long)</strong>
    x y</code>\r\n\r\nYou could just leave it as such, and the assembler would force
    the coordinate to be stored as a long value in the output bytecode, thus making
    a lossless round-trip conversion back into the original binary as nothing ever
    happened. But you could also delete the \"long\" cast and allow the assembler
    to build it with the default behavior, thus giving you a properly optimized version
    of the font.\r\n\r\nSecond. Flags that are exactly the same for a given series
    of points are not repeated, but are indicated to be repeated a number of times
    to save space in the binary. This could be presented as:\r\n\r\n<strong>point
    off</strong> x y, x\u2032 y\u2032, x\u2033 y\u2033</code>\r\n\r\nNow because in
    the binary, contour breaks are independent of both point and flag listings, this
    optimization can continue even with a contour boundary, giving a representation
    like so:\r\n\r\n<strong>point off</strong> x y, <strong>end</strong> x\u2032 y\u2032,
    x\u2033 y\u2033</code>\r\n\r\nThis would be different than points with flags that
    are same but made explicit for each point in the binary:\r\n\r\n<code><strong>point
    off</strong> x y\r\n<strong>point off end</strong> x\u2032 y\u2032\r\n<strong>point
    off</strong> x\u2033 y\u2033</code>\r\n\r\nFormats like TTX or UFO store contours
    as separated lists of points, thus make the two scenarios indistinguishable and
    some of the binary data simply gets lost."

    of techniques for making it spectacularly space efficient. It\u2019s those tricks
    that could be translated without a loss into some concise syntax, and be reassembled
    byte-for-byte."

  body: "<blockquote>The UFO format [\u2026] is ideal for storing font data in a readable
    form, and converting back to binary.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nMalcolm, I have to disagree.
    It\u2019s not an ideal archive nor conversion format. It\u2019s pretty primitive
    in what it can represent and how, thus it\u2019s bulky, and it loses much of the
    production details of both PostScript/CFF and TrueType binaries. For now, lack
    of any kind of hinting representation is probably the most notorious example.\r\n\r\nI
    think the unbeatable format for developing or archiving fonts with PostScript
    outlines is a raw PostScript Type 1 code. Type 1 is an acknowledged and stable
    technology in the industry, with lots of freely available utilities such as the
    good old Type 1 Utilities. It\u2019s also a format that has code-like qualities:
    it\u2019s plain text that is concise and can be edited by hand, versioned and
    manipulated with standard Unix tools and filters. Furthermore, it translates practically
    losslessly into the CFF in an OpenType binary.\r\n\r\nReal-life example: I have
    a bunch of PFAs I want to merge with Adobe's <code>mergeFonts</code> utility and
    bake a final OTF with <code>makeotf</code>. Before that, I have to wipe out any
    encodings in the PFAs to avoid conflicts on merge. So I disassemble them into
    raw Type 1 code with <code>t1disasm</code>, pipe it through <code>sed</code> with
    a simple regex, and assemble back into PFAs with <code>t1asm</code>, all in a
    single command:\r\n\r\n<code>t1disasm enc.pfa | sed '/^dup [0-9][0-9]* \\/..*
    put$/d' | t1asm --pfa > notdef.pfa</code>\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest case I could
    think of now; please see, for example, the build script of my Kontrapunkt Pro
    project at https://github.com/grzegorzrolek/kontrapunkt-pro/ for a much broader
    illustration.\r\n\r\nNow, TrueType outlines have no representation like that.
    Few people have mentioned TTX, but it\u2019s still an XML that\u2019s bulky by
    itself and that\u2019s hard to parse or edit, either by hand or any standard Unix
    utility. What\u2019s more, it doesn\u2019t represent TrueType\u2019s binary data
    close enough to make it a one-to-one conversion format."
