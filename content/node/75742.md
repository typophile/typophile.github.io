  archer and gotham for headline and subcategories respectively for online and pdfs.
  I used arial for body copy online. what font to use for body copy on pdfs? I know
  arial is based on helvetica, but it looks much too wide, and narrow much too narrow.
  I like gill sans but the number \"1\"s look like lower case \"L\"s. yuck.\r\nanyone
  have any advice? thank you!\r\n\r\n[PDF attachment removed due to copyright violation]"
