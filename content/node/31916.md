body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am wondering about the possibilities to modify the alias.dat
  file to match the encoding file I\u2019m using. It seems rather obvious what to
  do, but it doesnt work.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nIn the encoding file these exists:\r\n\r\nO\r\no.small\r\nhungarumlaut\r\nohungarumlaut.small\r\n\r\nIn
  the alias.dat, I added these values:\r\n\r\no.small O\r\nohungarumlaut.small o.small+hungarumlaut\r\n\r\nShouldnt
  it work? I\u2019ve restarted FontLab 5.02, but not the computer but it does not
  work as I want to.\r\n\r\nIs there something else I need to \"adjust\"?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\n"

    all the "alias.dat" files on your disk. I think you don't edit the right one.

    other one.\r\n\r\nThank you very much, Filip :)\r\n\r\n/ G\xF6ran\r\n\r\nPS. Btw,
    I got this encoding file from Peter at Fountain for a upcoming font there, so
    if I\u2019m not wrong \u2013 it\u2019s the one you created :) Just wanted to say,
    it\u2019s a really great encoding file, Filip. It makes things a whole lot easier
    when building."
