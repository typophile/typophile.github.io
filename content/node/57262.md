  is established for the purpose of educating the general public, and the next generation,
  on the beauties of wood types and engraved blocks. Our mission is to gather, save,
  preserve, and interpret wood types and information about them.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.unicorngraphics.com/wood%20type%20museum.asp\r\n"
