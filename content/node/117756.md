body: "I have a perplexing problem that has taken some time to nail down.  I was batch
  converting several fonts with Transtype Pro 3, and came across an oddity.  My effort
  was to group Postscript Fonts converted from TrueType in Suitcases that made sense.
  \ \r\nIn the process, many of the suitcases lost a substantial amount of data, but
  I discovered the program only removed the data if I changed any of the font's info,
  which was almost impossible to avoid in a process like this.  Upon experimentation,
  I discovered that the suitcase remained the same size as it's unconverted counterpart
  if I left the information untouched.  This would have left many a font orphaned
  from it's family, not to mention a lot of other housekeeping problems. \r\n\r\nIn
  my honest opinion, I don't understand why Transtype would alter a suitcase's bitmap
  font compliment when the font's info has been changed.  And mildly changed at that.\r\n\r\nTo
  keep all this quite scientific,  I obtained a copy of a font that was distributed
  in Postscript Type 1 and Truetype.\r\nThis is how I could be sure if the Suitcase
  had been \"cheated\".  I also compared the suitcase of the converted font (from
  Truetype) where I did not change any of the metadata, with that of the unconverted
  PS font.  I had to examine the suitcase in Mac OS 9 to be certain what point size
  bitmap fonts were in the individual suitcases, to be sure there was a match as well.
  \ Upon opening the suitcase of an altered font (a font where I changed some info),
  ALL of the bitmap fonts were only 3k in size, whereas the copy of the font that
  was purchased as a Postscript font in the first place had bitmap fonts of various
  (larger) sizes, just like the converted font with no info changes.\r\n\r\nA symptom
  of this problem can be revealed by opening a document in the old Appleworks word
  processor.  If you highlight some text in the document and change the font to your
  converted font (with the changed data) the text nearly disappears into a tiny little
  smudge of black.  This does not occur in Pages.  I am guessing that Pages ignores
  the bitmap fonts in the suitcase and does it's own rasterization on the fly.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,
  (I know you are going to ask this) I tried all of this with both the \"default hinting\"
  and \"No hinting\" options chosen.\r\nAND I was certain to clear the conversion
  window and drop the TT font in the window AFTER each time I changed these options.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "WooHoo!\r\n\r\nI guess I get to answer my own question on this one!!  But
    seriously, for all of you who use Transtype 3 to meet some of your design needs,
    I would like to share what I have learned.  \r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention
    that Mac OSX has it's own font rasterizer, much like that which has existed for
    Truetype fonts from  the beginning.   Thus, bitmap fonts in Postscript font suitcases
    are pretty much ignored under Mac OSX.  This makes the omission of the bitmap
    font data transparent under most circumstances in the Mac OS X environment.  For
    this reason I nearly missed this myself.  But I believe in thorough testing...\r\n\r\nWhat
    I found after closer examination is that Transtype creates \"placeholder\" 3Kb
    bitmap font files containing no data inside the suitcase built, but only if you
    change some of the font info prior to generating the new fonts.  Otherwise, proper
    bitmap fonts DO get generated using either the FreeType Rasterizer or (should
    you select it) the ATSUI rasterizer.\r\n\r\nSo this explains why the converted
    fonts with blank bitmaps \"disappear\" in Appleworks.  These \"blank\" suitcases
    create even more havoc in the world of Mac OS 9.  So it goes that Appleworks,
    being of the \"Classic\" mindset, does not take advantage of Mac OS X's superior
    rasterizer.  Kudos to Apple on that newer system feature.\r\n\r\nI admit to feeling
    foolish for not having thought of this before, because it works flawlessly:  Just
    process the fonts thru Transtype a second time and Voila! the bitmaps are back.\r\n\r\nNow
    you are saying to yourself, why isn't he getting with the plan and converting
    to Opentype?  I am an old guy, am a big fan of postscript, and set in my ways.
    \ So I too will someday go the way of the dinosaurs, and someone will throw all
    my treasured font CDs in the trash.\r\n\r\nIt is my sincere hope that I have somehow
    been helpful in a technical way to you, dear reader.  Perhaps I may have even
    provided you with some amusement.  If so, then I have accomplished my goal.  Have
    an awesome day!!"

    out last year. I don't believe it has this bug.  :)
