  pic attached - looks like Bodoni Black Condensed, but it's stronger with more weight
  on the finer stems...\r\n\r\nAny ideas??\r\nThanks!\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/COSTUME_5721.jpg]"

  body: Also - the display text is a tricky one - thought I'd nailed it with Covington,
    but it's much finer.....

  body: "With a publication of 1950, I doubt you are going to find an exact match
    to the rest of your type in a digital font today. My guess is that it was some
    foundry's take on a light <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/search/corvinus/fonts/'
    target='_blank'>Corvinus</a>. Dennis Ortiz-Lopez' OL Corvinus Versailles might
    be as close as you get.\r\n\r\nI have an image in a type book of a predigital
    Corvinus Medium Italic that has an alternate swashed A and M. It's was too heavy
    and not a match to your image - but it reflects the many variants that were being
    produced decades ago."

  body: As digital alternative to Corvinus, you may like [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/giorgio/giorgio|Giorgio]]
    by Christian Schwartz with main difference on /R leg bottom but available as true
    italic. No slanted swashy alternates like your /A though.
