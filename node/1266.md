body: i made this font - a oneline font to  get easy the weights from ultra thin to
  extrabold. for the moment, there are just the illustrator drawings, no kerning -
  no spacing. i just want to hear some opinions about the forms, and the mood of the
  alphabet.  <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1612.gif" ALT="GGrapidograph_reg.gif">

  body: ' Even though the face repeatedly uses some obvious devices it still lacks
    unity. I think the error lies not in the forms themselves, but in the counterforms
    they create. For example the negative space around the k has no relationship to
    anything else. The g has similar problems. The extension on the M also causes
    some awkwardness. The 5 and the G also demonstrate the same idea. While it is
    obvious the device used to create them, the resulting counterforms are completely
    inconsistent with the rest of the face. <BR> <BR>Another note: the tails on the
    lc letters feel like they are floating. Try decreasing the angle of the slant
    and lengthening them. '

  body: christian <BR>it seems, that you think my typeface is kind of crap. but your
    critique was really helpful to me and i&#39;m willing to finish the typeface anyway.
    <BR> <BR>so i change quite a lot. the lower case g and k were really strange in
    the kontext of a text. so i changed them to another mood.  <BR>also the slants
    of the lc letters a,b,d,u i changed so they reach the baseline. the slants of
    m,n,p,q,r i leave the same as they are. <BR> <BR>what do you think <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1623.gif"

  body: ' Thom -- I think you&#39;re going in the right direction with this typeface.
    The only aspect that I find jarring are the ears, such as on the r and m. For
    me, this is a very smooth font and I don&#39;t believe the ears add any readability.
    Anyone else agree or disagree? '

    stencils... uhm, hard to explain. Looks like those though, I like it. <BR> <BR>Btw,
    the new &#34;k&#34; is a huge improvement. '

  body: john <BR> <BR>i agree with you, that this is a smooth font. it was just the
    intention to get a bit of originality what makes me doing these ears. otherwise
    i&#39;m afraid this typeface is too techno. i wanted to get a bit of a typwriter
    mood in it.  <BR>do you think these ears are disturbing the other fletters? <BR>
    <BR>and john - what do you think lc &#34;a&#34;. i have the impression it is a
    bit too wide, perhaps it should be a bit more condensed..? <BR>&#40;sorry about
    my lousy english&#41; <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1624.gif"

  body: ' Sorry if I sounded harsh. I try to say it as I  <BR>see it. I do think the
    face has some good stuff  <BR>going on. I also think you are heading in the  <BR>right
    direction. Now all you need is something to <BR>make the face stand out from all
    of the other <BR>lineal geometrics out there. <BR> <BR>I actually think that the
    ears are a start in that <BR>direction. When set in copy I think they give the
    <BR>face a unique feel. They still feel a little abrupt, <BR>but I think they
    are the key. Is there a subtle way <BR>to incorporate the feel of the ears&#39;
    kinked line <BR>other places in the face &#40;like the caps&#41;? For <BR>example,
    what if the arm of the E and the F were <BR>to bend slightly? I&#39;m just throwing
    out ideas now. <BR>Good job. Keep it up &#40;I don&#39;t think that it is crap.
    <BR>Just a work in progress<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'allright - thanks to everybody. it is good to get critique for workin hard.
    i&#39;m still sitting behind the face, and made some experiments, about the ears,
    and found with it also a solution to change the general form - just a little bit,
    but with this changement, i think, i found perhaps a way to make my GGrapidograph
    stand out from all the other linear geometric faces out there - like christian
    said.  <BR> <BR>i hope you guys are still helping me to develop my font to a good
    end, so i can finish it, and agree with it. <BR> <BR><!-Attachment: ggrapidograph03.swf-!><CENTER><TABLE
