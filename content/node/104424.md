  BLAST 1, the famous British Vorticist publication. THe sample attached is of the
  serif face in question, the rest of the publication primarily uses a heavy Grot.
  \r\n\r\nIf you don't know it already, well worth a look at some truly avant-garde
  typography considering the context. http://dl.lib.brown.edu/mjp/render.php?view=mjp_object&id=1143209523824844\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BLAST_1143210659593763_6473.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks

    under the name Devinne in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. When it declined

  body: "You're welcome.\r\nBy 1914 various foundries produced their own flavors of
    Devinne, wider narrower, a nip here a tuck there. Plus various outline versions.\r\nTo
    find an exact match for the BLAST sample, a possible strategy might be to find
    out who the printer was & where they bought their type. The reference page mentions
    \"London: John Lane, the Bodley Head.\" I suspect that the type was probably purchased
    from a British foundry like Stephenson Blake. So a SB, or other British, specimen
    book from the era might have the Devinne variation you are seeking.\r\nAs for
    digital interpretations of the Devinne typefaces, most do not exist.\r\nDevinne
    went from the height of fashionable font taste before WWI to unspeakably quaint
    in the Art Deco era. It has never returned to fashion.\r\nBut in the 21st century
    there is a market for somewhere for everything, even the Devinne fonts. An opportunity
    for the enterprising digital font designer.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The Bitstream Romana is related, and on MyFonts they give the following description:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The
    French interest in the revival of suitably edited Oldstyle romans as an alternative
    to a world of Modern typefaces started in 1846 when Louis Perrin cut the Lyons
    capitals.\r\n\r\nAbout 1860, as Phemister was cutting the Miller & Richard Old
    Style in Edinburgh, Theophile Beaudoire turned the idea of the Lyons capitals
    into a complete Oldstyle typeface, with similar overwhelming success; it was generally
    known as Elzevir in France and Roemisch, Romanisch, Romaans or Romana in Germany,
    Holland and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, Gustav Schroeder, at the Central Division
    of ATF, expanded the series, adding a boldface under the name DeVinne. It was
    promptly copied, initially in Europe by Ludwig & Mayer, and spread rapidly throughout
    the US and Europe, becoming the best known member of the series. ATF made popular
    an ornamental form under the name De Vinne Ornamental.</blockquote>\r\n"
