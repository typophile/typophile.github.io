  inform them of an improper apostrophe that appears in the subscription information
  alongside the daily crossword. You'll find it in the word \"Today's\" in the following:\r\n\r\nAnnual
  subsriptions: Today's puzzle and more than 2,000 \r\npast puzzles, nytimes.com/crosswords
  ($34.95 a year)\r\n\r\nRegarding this I have two questions:\r\n\r\n1. How can we
  get this fixed? It's driving me nuts. My three or four emails to The New York Times
  and to its public advocate went unanswered.\r\n\r\n2. How much of an issue should
  this generally be? The vertical mark is used constantly in lieu of the \"smart\"
  curling apostrophe. I've been educated and appreciate the curling apostrophe. Tick
  marks are eyesores but it seems silly sometimes to make such a fuss about a miniscule
  detail in typography - seems to over-emphasize the grammatical aspect of an otherwise
  complex art.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"

    his email address is on his web site. But if you keep emailing people at the times
    they\u2019ll eventually decide you're a nutter.\r\n\r\n<cite>How much of an issue

    care, and the general public is essentially ignorant of the issue and quite happy
    to use tick marks instead, it really shouldn\u2019t be much of an issue. What
    we really need to do is get a competent US government willing to throw out the
    English measurements so those stupid inch and foot marks can come off of keyboards
    altogether."

    time to try to fix it. I'll come off as a nutball. But it seems as relevant as
    a small grammatical error - and The New York Times should be getting it right,
    especially if it's something that's there every day.\r\n\r\nHowever, on your point,
    jpad that \"Given that only anal retentive designers care, and the general public
    is essentially ignorant of the issue\" - would you extend that to other aspects
    of typography such as kerning and ragging?"

      we will see a shift to tick marks used everywhere when young designers who either

  body: ">The problem is that the keyboard was designed by computer engineers, not
    typographers. \r\n\r\nHmm, I think they copied the typewriter keyboard so I don't
    think they can be blamed for the original idea of reducing character sets. And
    Apple could have added them - the fact they didn't casts doubts on Jobs typographic
    credentials, no?\r\n\r\n<CITE>\r\n\"Reed College at that time offered perhaps
    the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster,
    every label on every drawer was beautifully hand-calligraphed. Because I had dropped
    out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy
    class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces,
    about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about
    what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically
    subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating. \r\n\r\nNone
    of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years
    later when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to
    me, and we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful
    typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac
    would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts, and since
    Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have
    them.\"</CITE>\r\n\r\n... but you know, key caps were expensive back then, so
    although it was the first computer with beautiful typography, we put the true
    quotes and ligs on some obscure shift state of the other random characters - sorry.

  body: "I have a couple of curmudgeonly comments to mutter into my grey beard.\r\n\r\nFirst,
    it is a fact of life that this crappy unisex tick mark has crept into our lives
    everywhere. Envision, please, a shiny brass sign in a hotel lobby, announcing
    the presence of a restaurant called Maude's: it's nicely buffed by the staff every
    week, and has engraved letters filled with scarlet enamel. The word is set in
    Mistral, <em>letterspaced</em> (which means the joins don't line up), and the
    apostrophe is the dreaded vertical tick. We've all seen it . . . \r\n\r\nThat
    doesn't mean we should not take every opportunity to <em>teach</em> people the
    difference. Many times they are grateful for it. I would say more often they are
    grateful than the times when they look at me as if I'm from Mars.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I lament the most about the loss of the true double and single quotes is that
    it represents a loss of utility in addition to lost style. In complex dialogue
    set with those traditional quotes, you have a reasonable idea of what's going
    in. If you lose them to unisex tick marks, then there is no indication of polarity
    (if that's a fair term to use). It makes the parsing of the story much more difficult!
    So the traditional quotes actually serve a genuine orientational purpose, a useful
    function.\r\n\r\nAs for the circumflex mentioned in an earlier post: I agree that
    it and the tilde are not much used in English typography! However, this calls
    to mind a very discouraging story from France several decades ago. The French
    tax authority bought new software for their mainframe computers, some monster
    new souped-up program from a developer in Houston or Dallas, who'd never even
    seen a circumflex. Suddenly, tens of thousands of people had their names altered.
    Families that had been spelling their surnames as For\xEAt suddenly became Foret,
    which, let's face it, ain't exactly the same thing. A sad outcome, especially
    because it didn't <em>have</em> to be that way. One culture not appreciating the
    subtleties of another.\r\n\r\nI take every chance I get to tell people about real
    apostrophes and quote marks and I explain how to make them (and, <em>par contre,</em>
    I point out how vigilant they should be that their inch and foot marks in dimensions
    don't get interpreted by design software as curly quotes). Show them the color
    of true small caps and they'll immediately see the difference between them and
    machine-generated small caps. I bet a lot of you do the same thing.\r\n\r\nWe
    are the bridge people, as Steve Harvard used to say. We know the difference and
    it is VITAL that we pass on the values from the old world to as many people as
    we can, even as the rest of the world sinks into a morass. It's still worth doing,
    in my view. Spread the word, one person at a time.\r\n"

    guardians of visual language. This is language after all \u2014 the magic marks
