  Aesthetics of Reading\u201D by Kevin Larson (Microsoft) and Rosalind Picard (MIT)</a>?
  In the article they propose new measurements that are supposed to guage the effectiveness
  of typographic refinements on readers. The measurements are based on perception
  of time spent reading and positive mood/cognitive task performance. An interesting
  approach."

    the roof.
