  body: No it&#39;s not. Looks like a blend of Gill Sans and Perpetua  <BR>or something
    similar... It&#39;s not Barnbrook&#39;s <a href="http://www.virusfonts.com/spec%20sheets/prototype.html"
    target="_blank"> Prototype</a>  <BR>as far as I can tell. Did <a href="http://www.whynotassociates.com/"
    target="_blank"> Why Not Associates</a> ever do a  <BR>hybrid font?

    <BR> <BR>Or could be a Carson-era font by <BR>Miles Newlyn. Can&#39;t remember
    the name.

    check my Carson book collection at home.  <BR>If it is, then it has to be somewhere
    in there.
