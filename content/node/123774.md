  and am currently researching the creation of artwork for the band\u2019s sixth album,
  Rubber Soul.  You can see the album cover at: www.thebeatles.com/album/rubber-soul.
  \ Not only is the distorted Rubber Soul photo an immediate eye-catcher but, for
  the first time on a Beatles\u2019 album, the title typography is also a star.  The
  title in the upper left corner was designed by Charles Front in the fall of 1965
  and has been described by critics as \u201Cbulbous\u201D, \u201Crubbery\u201D, and
  \u201Cpsychedelic\u201D.   Here\u2019s where I can use your help.\r\n\r\nFirst,
  is there a proper name for this style of lettering?  I\u2019m familiar with the
  common word-processing fonts \u2013 Calibri, Arial and the like - but my research
  has yet to turn up a name for this unusual typographic design.  What\u2019s it called?\r\n\r\nSecond,
  did this lettering style have a history of use prior to appearing on the Rubber
  Soul cover in December 1965?  Perhaps it was not common before then but I know it\u2019s
  difficult to say that something is a first, as some have said the Rubber Soul cover
  was the first to use this style.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and consideration of
  my questions.\r\n"

    this previous discussion: http://typophile.com/node/35379\r\nPersonally, I tend
    to associate \"psychedelic\" more to the kind of poster lettering originating
    with the Vienna Secession in the 1900s and rediscovered in the 1960/1970s (example:

  body: "I\u2019m inclined to think that the lettering concept is quite original,
    a response to the serendipity of the photo\u2019s distortion. 1965 was too early
    for the West Coast psychedelic lettering style in which Wes Wilson morphed jugendstijl.
    Just look at the early Family Dog posters from 1966, it\u2019s not emerged yet.\r\n\r\nThe
    album art fashion in the UK beat group/mod era of the early-mid 1960s was for
    strong typography, lots of Compacta, a reaction against the hand-lettering of
    the late 1950s\u2014which would include the beatnik style of loose interlocking.\r\n\r\nJust
    look at the title of the Stones\u2019 1966 album Aftermath, based on Impact-like
    letter-forms. Hand-drawn, but still wedded to the mod(ernist) aesthetic. http://wwwrollingstones.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/1966/04/aftermath-uk-600x600.jpg\r\n\r\nModernism
    and psychedelia were parallel trends in the 1960s, the modernism slightly earlier.\r\n\r\nDonovan
    album from 1965\u2014he transitioned from folk to psychedelic, his producer Mickie
    Most had an eclectic influence. http://www.hotplatters.com/images/2-182.jpg That\u2019s
    as close as it gets."

    and nameless.

    \ Stories have been published in \"Beatlefan\" magazine in the issue marking each
    album's 50th anniversary.  \"Help!\" comes up this summer; \"Rubber Soul\" for
    the holidays.  I'll take you up on your offer for your observations about the
    typography on upcoming albums - thank you very much for offering!\r\n\r\nI'm not
    writing about the US releases except in cases where thew US covers were based
    on the UK art, such as \"With/Meet The Beatles\", \"A Hard Day's Night\", \"Help\",
    and, now, \"Rubber Soul\", which was the first cover truly shared by UK and US
    releases (although the songs were different).\r\n\r\nThanks again for your interest,
    time and insights.   Looking forward to further discussions. Best, Ken\r\n"
