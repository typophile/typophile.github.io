  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is the logo I am working with currently. The company it belongs to is a part of big wood processing group in Eastern Europe. All logos of the companies that belong to it look the same, so I can&rsquo;t do anything about the letterforms or colors.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t like about it but don&rsquo;t know how to correct is the negative space between character pairs r-a and t-d. I have taken the strictly geometric approach, spacing between all elements is the same. I tried to loosen all the letters, but it starts to look &ldquo;fallen apart&rdquo;, and loosening only the &ldquo;ltd&rdquo; part attracts too much attention to it, although it has the least importance.</p>
<p>What should I do or probably I shouldn&rsquo;t do anything at all?</p>

In the end though it is the differences that make the letters.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Maija, don&rsquo;t worry too much about the uneven tone caused by the excess negative space between those particular letter pairs. Remember its a logo, not body text, so even tone and total consistency need not be prime considerations. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfectly even and consistent&mdash;logos are part design, part art and part compromise.</p>
<p>The narrow space between the letters looks the same as the stencil gaps in the letters themselves. I think you could comfortably space the letters out a bit by doubling the letterspacing. That will make the larger negative spaces appear less odd.</p>
<p>The curve on the j doesn&rsquo;t match the curves on the other letters; replace it with a curve from one of the other letters.</p>
<p>You can reduce the gap between r - a by compacting the arm of the r. Just slide it to the left. That component doesn&rsquo;t have to be the same width as similar parts elsewhere. I know, I know, its a modular design, but it has to be practical. Cheat to make it look right.</p>
<p>Then widen the bowl (lower bit) of the a to take up some of the negative space under the arm of r. Next, narrow the arm (top) of the a by sliding it to the right. Then you can move the a to the left without it crashing into the r.</p>
<p>Tim&rsquo;s solution for the t is good. Paste the arm of the a onto the bottom of the t, then narrow it to make it fit. The bar of t is already much narrower than its equivalent parts on the a and r. Okay, so this logo was not totally consistent to begin with :-) Arms and bars on t and r in most fonts are much narrower than consistent modular proportions would have them. Your t was originally made narrow in proportion to the other letters.</p>
<p>I would replace the sharp diagonal top of the t with a curve.</p>
<p>Also consider replacing all the square stem tops (b, l, d) with curves.</p>
<p>To be consistent and make the logo look fresh (contemporary), I would replace the Futura capitals &ldquo;WOOD PROCESSING COMPANY&rdquo; with a contemporary font.</p>

<p>What I meant was, don&rsquo;t worry about it too much about acheiving perfectly even tone, but do what you can to even things out. Its art, and doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect, but it helps to apply discipline for the sake of good design.</p>

<p>There is one way of filling it:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/boulderaja2.png]</p>
<p>Unicase might turn out to be a passing fad, and it seems unlikely to be of serious use for text typography, but it comes in very handy sometimes for logos.</p>
<p>A few variations, just for fun:</p>
