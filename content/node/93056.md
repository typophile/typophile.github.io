body: Does anyone know what the secondary font used in the Godiva logo is? The word
  "Godiva" seems to be Optima, but that is used for "Chocolatier"? Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Godiva-Chocolatier-logo_5156.jpeg]

    body: That's really close, but the the lowercase "h" is different, unless that
      font comes with alternatives. Finding a font with its "h" styled like that has
      been my biggest difficulty in finding the correct font.

  body: "Probably the letter \xABh\xBB has been redesigned in order not to be confused
    with the lowercase \xABb\xBB."
