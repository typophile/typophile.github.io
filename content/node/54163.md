  body: I'm not entirely thrilled with the Morgan's web interface to view digitized
    documents. Kind of like looking through a keyhole.

    doesn\u2019t anyone ever fact check that and realize that Gutenberg printed multiple
    editions of Donatus before he printed the bible?"

  body: Donatus was a grammarian who wrote Latin grammar primers. A little dull now,
    but his work was quite important for teaching Matin grammar to people so they
    could read things like Latin bibles.

    significant?"

  body: "The text does say \"the first <em>significant</em> printed book in the West\"...
    I'm not saying that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_grammatica\">a
    survey of Latin grammar</a> is more or less significant than the Christian bible,
    mind you, but the journalist seems to have done her research. :-)\r\n\r\nIf someone
    were to ask me which of these two books has had more influence in Western history,
    I would have to say it was the Christian bible. Not to mention the fact that thanks
    to Gutenberg it could be mechanically reproduced. That changed things, too."
