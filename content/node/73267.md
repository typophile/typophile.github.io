body: "Hello there fellow Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for advice on a typeface
  for the body text on a website I'm working on. The website is about wedding photography,
  so I'm thinking that an elegant (but legible) roman typeface would fit nicely. Though
  I would really like to use true small caps, something I'm having trouble finding
  in a web font. <strong>Question: Do you know any free or affordable web fonts with
  true small caps?</strong> (that fit my requirements)\r\n\r\nI've been looking at
  Typekit and Typotheque and the best I could come up with is <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_text\">Greta
  Text</a> or maybe <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/brioni_text\">Brioni
  Text</a>.\r\n\r\nAny other recommendations?"

    latest Firefox beta added this feature: \r\nhttp://opentype.info/blog/2010/08/14/better-web-typography-with-opentype-features/\r\n\r\nI
    would recommend to stick with Typotheque because their backend allows you to convert
    the selected fonts to small caps, so every browser then can show the true small
    caps. "

  body: "Thanks for all the great suggestions :)\r\n\r\nI ended up using a typeface
    I found elsewhere though. The one I got was <a href=\"http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/caslon-fs\">Caslon</a>
    from Fontspring. Six weights, including two small caps weights for 20 bucks in
    total, pretty good deal if you ask me."
