body: I could have put this in the crit section, but since it's just one character,
  i thought i'd stick it here. Anyway, i wanted to get some opinions on my Eng (the
  first character) I included the D as well for contrast (second character). Is the
  Eng sufficiently differentiated from the D? Would a native reader be able to decipher
  this letter as i've drawn it? can anyone point me to other cursive examples of this
  character? as always, any help is appreciated. thnx.

  body: actually, i've been kind of looking at [[Zapfino]] for some ideas, but i didn't
    reference it for this character. do you know if the Eng is in that charset? is
    there a pdf anywhere that i can check out for reference?

  body: "Paul, if you look at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/zapfino-extra/\">The
    Linotype Zapfino Extra family</a> on MyFonts, you can click on each of the four
    fonts. Then, click on the link for the full character set. Then you can select
    which code page you want to look at. \r\n\r\nI suspect that each of the four Zapfinos
    has its own Eng, but I don't have the font with me at the moment.\r\n\r\nThere
    isn't a comparable feature or PDF on the Linotype site at the moment, sorry! :(\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"
