body: I have started roughs on a logo for a company called versa-tables. They manufacture
  computer desks, stands and table for schools, medical facilities and offices.  <a
  href="http://www.versatables.com" target="_blank">www.versatables.com</a>. Any help
  would be great. Let me know if anything works or doesn&#39;t.  More to come, thanks.<img

  body: It looks like you might need to do more exploritory work for this mark. Try
    looking at other generic furniture company logo&#39;s and see how they tackled
    this problem. Knoll, Ikea, etc. You might find that putting a table in the logo
    is extremely literal, especially since the word table already exists. Consider
    the stucture and versitility of the table and the structure and versitility of
    the type.

  body: I think you are trying to hard, logo design is about reduction, simplicity,
    I agree with david_g seek inspiration in the actual product, think of the structure,
    how it works

  body: I agree go for something more generic, a nice word mark or something like
    craig mentioned. <BR> <BR>I would also sway away from some of the 3d looking and
    gradient logos, maybe thats me but I have seen an many identities like that recently,
    and I think the normal vectors still look the best. Some of the other logos are
    not very legible either, like the dot matrix thing. I would keep exploring this
    one.

  body: Mike, you really need to check out the Knoll logo, it really says alot about
    their furniture by just using simple san serif typography.  <BR> <BR>Think about
    the reasons people are buying office furniture. 1. They don&#39;t want it to break.
    2. They want the style to last forever. 3. They want it to be comfortable. 4.
    They want it to be versitile. 5. They want it to be cheap.  <BR> <BR>Now your
    logo should problably be able to describe at least 4 out of 5 of those topics
    or it will be unsuccesful. Good Luck

  body: Thanks for your responces everyone. I&#39;m having a hard time with this one.  I
    understand what you are saying about the Knoll logo David, but I know my client
    and he wouldd honestly laugh at me if I presented versatables in helvetica, and
    wanted some money for it.  I think with versatables, style is out of the picture....all
    that really matters is function and it being a solid product. I&#39;ll keep at
    at and see what happens.

    a simple solution could be very powerful.

    is this'

  body: Hi mike, <BR> <BR>Just look for an easy &amp; memorable shape. You have the
    T that could be just a leg of the table or even look for a &#34;cool&#34; table
    surface and yes, keep it simple is the best.  <BR> <BR>I know it&#39;s not an
    easy task to &#34;sell&#34; your idea to the client, I&#39;ve just had a case
    where the logo concept was totally subverted &amp; destroyed. &#34;Put some wings&#34;
    on those letters they said. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve remembered Psyops ARMCHAIR font
    that can be a starting point &#40;they have a flash try that I&#39;ve used and
    print screened 2 variations&#41;, check some examples I&#39;ve made. Hope they
    can be of any help. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39152.gif"

    logo ideas they are very nice. I rethought the thing and created this.  What do
    you think...I&#39;m going for a VT type of shape...keep in mind, it will probably
    be one color, not black. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39312.gif"

    Tech or Vermont, unless you can come up with something using the VT that makes
    you think &#34;furniture company&#34; very obviously. <BR>Also, Adriano&#39;s
    suggestions have a good type/logo proportion worth imitating. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
