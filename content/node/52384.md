  also a strong attempt to supplant the authority of aristocracy and established churches

    a lot happening in Anglosphere typography during that era (and before), due to
    the repressive state monopoly on publishing exercised by the Company of Stationers
    in the UK. The enlightenment of typography really occurred in the early 19th century,
    when new commercial media opened the doors to new forms of type. '

    them not very interesting/worthy?\r\n\r\nSo the ideals of that period didn't manifest
    in type until after the fact. That seems reasonable. Do any examples spring to
    mind?\r\n\r\nInterested and seeking.\r\n"
