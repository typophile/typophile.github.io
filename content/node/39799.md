    Switzerland, AFAIK.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of guillemets: have there been any attempts

    pretty sure Gill didn\u2019t specifically \u201Clower the left ones.\u201D I believe
    that in this case Gill was employing the approach known as a \u201Cturned comma.\u201D
    One may suppose that at this time, Gill had not cut or cast an opening quote mark
    for Joanna. In this essay, he has instead taken a comma and turned it 180\xB0
    to serve as his opening quote mark. \r\n\r\nBecause of the position of the baseline
    on the body (i.e., the ascenders and descenders are nearly the same length), the
    turned comma in Joanna winds up positioned at about the x-height.\r\n\r\nThis
    was an antiquated practice even then, reflecting the evolution of the quotation
    mark. \r\n\r\nThe apostrophe existed prior to the use of modern quotation marks.
    During the early development of the [English-speaking] quotation style we\u2019re
    familiar with today, there was a period of time when the apostrophe doubled as
    a closing quote mark and a comma was turned to mark the opening. \r\n\r\nIn time,
    as this convention for open and close quote marks took hold, a dedicated opening
    quote mark was cast to improve the alignment."

    create unsightly holes in the text because most of the space they occupy is above
    x-height (or below the baseline), and they can cause confusion because they resemble
    or are identical to apostrophes (and commas).\r\n\r\nI don't think my aversion
    to them is a cultural thing -- as a matter of fact, there's many things in <em>foreign</em>
    typographic cultures that I'd love to see more often in German typographic culture
    (and have started using whereever I can), such as the British (and Canadian?)
    practice of omitting the period in abbreviations like \xBBDr\xAB and \xBBMr\xAB.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gill_5998.png]"

    or Palatino, in which guillemets (pointing inwards, in the German style) were
    used. This is because they were from German publishers.\r\n\r\nSince Germany still
    uses parentheses the same way most of the world does (I remember one area - was
    it Armenia? - where they are reversed being discussed here), I'm not surprised,
    though, that some people are confused and use guillemets the French or Swiss way
    instead, as suggested by the correspondence in appearance between them and parentheses.\r\n\r\nThe
    typewriter single and double quotes are distinct - in Unicode as well as in appearance
    - from the symbols for \"minutes\" and \"seconds\" as parts of a degree, the former
    being vertical and the latter being sloped. As far as what the proper symbol for
    \"inches\" might be, I would have to find a typeset book on carpentry, or drafting
    - and, in fact, I would be inclined to look at <em>several</em> of them, not being
    at all confident that even if there was a proper standard for the symbol, it would
    in fact be consistently adhered to.\r\n\r\nHowever, I suspect that the symbol
    for \"minutes\" is also used for \"feet\", and the symbol for \"seconds\" is also
    used for \"inches\". The alternative, using conventional 6699 quotes, would, I
    think, look jarring, and vertical typewriter-style quotes, while they are what
    people using typewriters had to use, were <em>not</em> among the sorts available
    on a Linotype, even though there was a similar-looking character, but not positioned
    high enough to serve that purpose."
