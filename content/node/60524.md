  NimbusSanPUILig, but i can't find that Nimbus.\r\nAll other Nimbusses are not the
  same.\r\n\r\nNotice the Helvetica-like R and the Futura-like Z\r\n\r\nAnybody?\r\nThx!\r\n"

    is the URW equivalent of Helvetica Neue, and the Light weight looks a lot like
    everything but your Z. Actually, I think you were exactly right -- I think they
    used a Z from Futura.  What simpler way to 'customize' a font?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "thx for your fast reply!\r\njust bought it but it's still too different from
    the font(s)that is/are used. (for instance the U is much wider and the E much
    smaller.\r\nAlso tried with helvetica neue...\r\npretty weird, can't imagine the
    designer used letters from all kinds of fonts for a small sentence... :s "

  body: "What does the sample represent? It has clearly been tightly spaced for a
    reason, such as style, or space saving (not legibility, I would say). It's possible
    that more than the Z was borrowed from another font, or that some graphic manipulating
    was done for artistic effect. This might all have been done with fonts that were
    at hand, and if the weights matched, then why not mix them to create something
    new?  \r\n\r\nI suspect designers often do this, and it creates challenges for
    Type ID Board members :)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    name of a district/neighbourhood in the city of Antwerp ('Antwerpen' in Dutch)..\r\n\r\nWhen
    doing a search for this image I only came across the 'Nieuw Zuid' part, which
    design seems to also be used on http://www.laundryday.be/\r\n\r\nTo add to the
    list of fonts that could be used, the U seems to correspond with Myriad Pro Condensed"

    designer of the poster has no time.\r\n\r\njust got in touch with him, it is indeed
    a costum made font based on Nimbus Sans Novus.\r\n\r\ni just went with Nimbus,
    since there was a deadline and the designer is on holidays.\r\n\r\nthx for the
