    an ID first you might as well give it up as a bad job, the implication being that
    I'm the Typophile village idiot.\r\n\r\nAnyway 6 minutes isn't that slow.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes Yves, I'm a very busy man, and only look in here now and then to relieve the
    stress of my hectic days. ;^)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
