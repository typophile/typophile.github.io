body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Typefaces]] : Futura</strong>\r\n\r\nProbably the most
  important [[geometric sans]] typeface, often imitated but never (quite) excelled.
  Designed by [[Paul Renner]] for the old German [[Bauer]] foundry (today the [[Fundici\xF3n
  Tipogr\xE1fica Bauer]] in Spain) between 1927 and 1930. Strongly influenced by the
  Weimar-era minimalist spirit that also played a role in the [[Bauhaus]] school (Renner
  himself was not a member of the Bauhaus). The large Futura family comprises one
  of the earliest [[sans serif]] [[type system]]s, and has grown over the years to
  include a complementary condensed family, a wide range of weights, and obliques.\r\n\r\nAlmost
  80 years later, Futura's popularity as a crisp, clean sans serif typeface has not
  waned, and versions of the family are available from almost every major vendor.
  The original designs owned by Fundici\xF3n Tipogr\xE1fica Bauer are distributed
  via the Spanish foundry [[Neufville Digital]], who offer a superior version of the
  family with old style figures and small caps. Futura as Renner originally conceived
  it was definitely a product of the experimental spirit of the times, and included
  a wide variety of radically diverse alternate forms for various letters. While not
  offered by Bauer with the original metal version of the typeface, and then left
  unavailable for many years, these alternate forms were included by [[The Foundry]]
  in their issue of Architype Renner.\r\n\r\nIn the 1980s, [[Adrian Frutiger]] took
  inspiration from Futura in his design of [[Avenir]], and later [[Avenir Next]] (with
  [[Akira Kobayashi]], 2004). These are less new typefaces than revisions of Futura
  to match Frutiger's model of how the sans serif typeface should work.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a

  also [[Steile Futura]]."
