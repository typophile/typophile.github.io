  LF, because the Insider Regular Roman they bought has old style figures. I have
  a font ready with lining figures that they could use immediately. In stead they
  used Helvetica for all the numbers! My god, they must love Insider, otherwise who
  else would go through all this trouble to change ALL the numbers into another font?

  anyone comes across a printed sample, I'd love to have one. You find my <a href=\"http://www.characters.nl/\"

  body: "Congrats Ren\xE9. As for the numerals: There are SEC (Securities & Exchange
    Commission) rules regarding the typesetting of financial statements, with very
    specific uses of indents, thickness of underlines, etc. And tabular figures are
    called for to make clear and perfectly-aligning financial tables. The Oldstyle
    versus Lining issue was probably a factor, but not as much as the Proportional
    versus Tabular."

  body: "Si, I can't put my hands to any document of regulations, but I'm sure they're
    out there on the internets. (When I was a graphic designer, I worked on a trio
    of annual reports, and all attempts at typographic styling in the financials section
    were completely shot down by the client due to the SEC requirements. When I then
    went and looked at other annuals, I noticed that all of the financials were typeset
    exactly the same way.)\r\n\r\nSo, make sure that your typefaces have tabular figures,
    and that the width is the same in all weights. And include figurespace (uni2007)
    and figuredash (uni2012) in your fonts.\r\n\r\nBy the way, 2006 is the Unicode
    index of the six-per-em space. Happy six-per-em space year, everyone."

    never heard about this regulation. I would be interested to find out more about
    this. \r\nI know that numbers should be tabular, what makes also sence to me.
    But that SEC regulation is new to me. \r\n\r\nIf anyone finds more about it, please
    post it.\r\n\r\n*** www.characters.nl  { Typography to express yourself } ***\r\nhttp://www.characters.nl/rss/rss.xml"
