  body: "I think that if you're going for \"clean,\" this doesn't quite work as a
    logo. The tightness of the letterspacing causes a number of extremely dark, frankly
    ugly spots; for example, the m and i and the a and t. Also, using what appears
    to be Helvetica isn't often a spectacular way to distinguish yourself in a logo,
    nor is it especially considered modern anymore (although it can certainly be if
    used in the right way). \r\n\r\nI'd try working on your logo concept some more;
    maybe just do some free associative sketches for a while. What would you like
    to convey to someone with your logo? How do you see yourself as a photographer?
    I'd experiment with both typographic and largely graphic logos; either can work
    as long as it's inventive and memorable."

  body: "...and I thought I was a hair-splitting pedant ; )\r\n\r\nHiro he's a <em>photographer;</em>
    photographers aren't necessarily supposed to know that if they put letterforms
    into their 'logo' they get something called a logotype. Or that 14 tightly-spaced
    characters in Arial Black does not a logo make.\r\n\r\nMatt, by the same token
    \u2013 you're not selling design, so if you like what you've done, go with it.
    Otherwise, maybe consider hiring a designer who actually specialises in these
    things; maybe you could trade them some photographic services in payment."

    designer but photographer, why not just setting you name \"matt smith photo\"
    in a nice clean sans.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I must agree with ben, hire a designer."

  body: "When I look at this, I don't think photography, I think photofinishing. To
    reiterate what others have said, lose the Arial and lighten it up, either by using
    a lighter font or opening up the kerning.\r\n\r\nThe connected \"smith\" and \"photo\"
    could work, but I'd look into other directions as well.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    Something like <cite>matt<strong>photo</strong>smith</cite>, with <cite>photo</cite>
    in a different weight and/or color.
