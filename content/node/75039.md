  the first ever to colour bacon! And in the process I created a bacon colour wheel!
  Cooks just like ordinary bacon, taste just like plain bacon too, rainbow bacon has
  arrived :). \r\n\r\nAfter interviews in NYC, LA, with AOL (the best interview!),
  BBC, CBC, Toronto Star, etc., and turned down a whole bunch more, I'm just now beginning
  to recover and look back at the impact I had on bacon nation. Met some really great
  people, some loves the coloured bacon, some kinda sorta, and some not so much. All-in-all
  great responses, it's all good, every single last bit of it!\r\n\r\nOh ya, in the
  process I also created a little something called bacon-on-a-stick. Two strips of
  coloured bacon with a white chocolate filling wrapped in white chocolate, all on
  a popsicle stick!\r\n\r\nIncredible stuff - what a ride. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
