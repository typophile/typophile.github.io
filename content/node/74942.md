body: "I have this lookup for ordinals. It works OK for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.,
  and for Caps, 1ST, 2ND, 3RD, etc., but not for ordinals in French or Spanish, which
  use one or three ordinals e.g. 2\xBA or 1\xE8me.\r\n\r\nHow can I change my code
  to cater for one or more alpha characters after the digits? One to three superscripts
  would be OK, but I think one or more would be more flexible. \r\n\r\nfeature Ordinals
  ordn {\r\n    lookup Ordinals;\r\n}\r\n    group @Digits [zero-nine];\r\n    group

    following code does what is needed as long as the ordinal glyphs are included
    in the font and have the corresponding Postscript names.\r\n\r\nfeature Ordinals
    ordn {\r\n    lookup Ordinals;\r\n}\r\n    group @Ordinals [zero-nine uniE2C0-uniE2C9
    uniEAA1 - uniEABA uniEAC1 - uniEADA uniEB28 uniEB3A uniEB48 uniEB5A];\r\n    group
    @Alphas [A-Z a-z Egrave Uacute egrave uacute];\r\n\r\n    lookup Ordinals{\r\n
    \   context (@Ordinals) @Alphas;\r\n    sub 0 Super;\r\n}  lookup Super {\r\n
    \   sub [A-Z] -> [uniEAA1 - uniEABA];\r\n    sub [a-z] -> [uniEAC1 - uniEADA];\r\n
    \   sub Egrave -> uniEB28;\r\n    sub Uacute -> uniEB3A;\r\n    sub egrave ->
    uniEB48;\r\n    sub uacute -> uniEB5A;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe @Ordinals group includes
    the digits, OldStyle figures, and the Superscripts, so any character in the @Alpha
    group following a digit or superscript in the @Ordinals group will use the \"Super\"
    lookup table, and will also be superscripted. As soon as a character not included
    in the @Alpha group is encountered, the superscripted text reverts to normal text.\r\n\r\nI
    used FontCreator 6.1 to create my fonts. I wrote a script to map the ordinals,
    copy the base glyphs, scale them, and embolden them. That removes much of the
    donkey work. I included capitals for using ordinals in All Caps or Small Caps
    text. "

    to say?  \r\n\r\nIs it a good solution or have I missed something that could improve
