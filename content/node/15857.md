  body: "The riddle goes: \"What's the plural for 'un petit beurre'*?\", the reply
    being the nonsensical word 'des touyoux'. When your interlocutor looks at you
    all puzzled and asks why, you then say: \"Because: 'Un p'tit beurre, des touyoux'.\"\r\n\r\nIt
    works better when you pull this trick on a Frenchman though... :^D\r\n\r\n<em>*
