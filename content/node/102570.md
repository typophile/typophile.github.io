  body: "You need to study the relationship between inner space and the space between
    glyphs. And rhythm. Glyphs knit together in words and words into sentences need
    a certain flow... Your /m/ is like a stop sign. And your /s/ like a splotch of
    liquid soap.\r\n\r\nAlso, try to avoid too much copy/paste \u2014 it impedes character."

  body: Your connection on the desender of the g is rough looking - does not flow.
    Bert is right your s is tight and awkward.

  body: "<em>Bert Vanderveen:</em>\r\n/m/ - Completely agree. I think I can save it
    by making it wider. Something between what it is now and two /n/ tied together.\r\nRhythm/flow
    - Is it the glyphs' shapes what produces it? Or my kerning needs revision too?\r\nCopy&paste
    - I don't get it at all.\r\n\r\n<em>Bert Vanderveen & bojev:</em>\r\n/s/ - Completely
    (and bitterly) agree. It's one of the glyphs I touched and retouched most, and
    I think the more I touch it the worse it gets. Maybe I should try to redo it with
    a more diagonal stroke in the centre?\r\n\r\n<em>bojev:</em>\r\n/g/ - I wanted
    to make it different. I see different does not necessarily mean better. I will
    try to stick to a more conventional g.\r\n\r\nThank you both!"

  body: I don't think the horizontally cut terminals on the round strokes are suitable
    in the context of these shapes. It's like they're whittled to sharp points. I'd
    cut them perpendicular to the stroke as you have done with /a/.

    body: "Thank you cerulean.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the original /a/ had an horizontal
      cut too. I made it perpendicular because horizontal looked horrible. I don't
      know why didn't I do the same with the rest. I think I kind of liked how it
      looked like in the /c/ and others (and \"kind of like\" often leads to \"feel
      attached\"). But I will give a go to your suggestion!"

  body: "I do like the concept of rounded endings of the strokes. The most important
    input i would like to give you is, to make the stroke width a bit more continuous,
    by having same stroke widths for all the horizontal, vertical and round (of course
    differing between vertical- and horizontal-round) strokes. When i see the uppercase
    \xABS\xBB and the lowercase \xABs\xBB i start to think, that you might have drawn
    the uppercase \xABS\xBB first and then tried to scale it down to a lowercase \xABs\xBB.
    Of course only if that\u2019s the case, i would recommend you first to draw letters
    like \xABn\xBB and \xABo\xBB, then test them and look for a rhythm with the white
    space between that fits your purpose and suits your taste. if you have those two
    letters you can derive a lot of forms. Not to be derived are organic forms like
    the \xABs\xBB, the \xABg\xBB and the \xABa\xBB. They are unique and you would
    do well to draw them as such.\r\n\r\nI hope i could help you. Here is a link to
    a picture, that shows you pretty much what \xABflow\xBB means. Those letters look
    totally constructed, but if you have a look at the \xABS\xBB you may realize,
    that there is no way to easily construct organic forms.\r\nhttp://maxboam.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/thomasewingfrench-essentialsoflettering-1912-02.jpg\r\n\r\nI
    think what Bert tried to say with \xABtry to avoid copy paste\xBB is: The round
    shape of a lowercase \xABd\xBB and the round shape of the \xABo\xBB should be
    treated a bit separately. I don\u2019t see too much copy paste in your font myself,
    so i can not give you any specifics.\r\n\r\nbest regards"

  body: "Hello 37DMK .\r\n\r\nYes, there's quite a bit of \"that\" copypaste, so <em>my
    /d/ looks like an /o/ with a stick instead of like a letter by itself?</em>. If
    that's what you and Bert Vanderveen are trying to make me realise, I think I have
    a huge load of work to do.\r\n\r\nRegarding the /S/-/s/, there was no scaling
    (in fact, I did all the lower case first), but the analogy was perfect to have
    an idea of what my /s/ looks like. This raises another question: does that mean
    you found my /S/ to be \"the good one\" (or at least, more consistent)? Every
    time I look at it I wish there was less difference between the two curves.\r\n\r\nI'm
    quite surprised nobody told anything about the verticals of the /M/ and the horizontal
    of the /A/. I find them less and less in harmony with the rest of the glyphs.
    But maybe that's just a pet peeve preventing me to see the real problems.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the \"flow\", I guess it's an eye training thing and will eventually click.\r\n\r\nThank
    you very much!"

  body: "Hello guillem.\r\nI think we get to know each other. I am sorry for assuming,
    that the lowercase \xABs\xBB is a scaled uppercase and yes i think the uppercase
    \xABS\xBB is a good start. Sure there is a lot of work, but don\u2019t worry,
    making a font is always a huge load of work and the process is what matters, because
    the results always keep getting better and better while you optimise your workflow.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you referring to the verticals of the \xABA\xBB, now i see, that they are a tad
    on the thick side (But i make that mistake all the time so who am i to tell) and
    more important i would lower the horizontal bar, so you have more space inside
    it (per haps you thought to make it on the same height as the lowercase \xABf\xBB
    middle bar, but if you have a look at this: \xABAf\xBB i think you get the picture).
    Also stroke widths should be continuous like: the verticals are the widest, the
    diagonals are a little less wide and the horizontals are the most narrow ones.
    The round strokes can be mostly fit into the widths of the other strokes, except
    for the uppercase round strokes, you will want to make them a tad wider when you
    simply look at strokes with the exact same width. Also if you want to make it
    a little more pleasing to the eye you could make the ascending diagonal strokes
    a little thinner than the descending ones (but that depends on the taste and the
    area of usage).\r\n\r\ni hope that helps you.\r\n\r\nand again best regards"

    body: "Hello 37DMK ,\r\n\r\nNo reason to be sorry!\r\n\r\nI will try to lower
      the horizontal stroke of the /A/ to the same level of the /G/ chin, and tweak
      a bit the stroke widths, together with the other suggestions in the thread.
      That will keep me busy for a while!\r\n\r\nThank you for both super elaborate
      answers!"
