  body: Now <em>that</em> is almost certainly hand drawn. In those days it made much
    more sense to have a lettering artist custom design the nameplate of your magazine,
    as well as type for advertisements and such. Furthermore there was no way on earth
    they could have done the overlapping T and C and the negative leading with type.
