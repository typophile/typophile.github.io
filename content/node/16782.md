  body: The direction the birds are flying is drawing away from the name. Perhaps
    better to have them flying toward the right and flying into the box instead of
    out of it?

  body: "hmmn. good suggestion.\r\n\r\nthe sheild/duck crest is a legacy mark evolution
    in a way. chris-craft used a shield at some point with quadrants that also contained
    a sailboat (despite the fact that they made motorboats)--see attached. the guy
    who started the company (long-ago now) started by building duck hunting boats
    (as opposed to luxury motorboats) and presumably because of that, the pair of
    ducks is on the company crest.\r\n\r\nthe boat club has used their own variation
    of the chris-craft shield as a logo for some time now (since mid-70s)--see attached.
    at first it appears that they just wholesale appropriated the crest, and only
    dropped the club name into it. at some point they erased a picture of a sailboat
    from one quadrant of the crest, and moved the ducks into it (leaving one quadrant
    empty for 10 years). later on someone drew (poorly) a motorboat into the other
    quadrant. but the ducks have remained, despite these (and other, smaller) changes.
    so basically i condensed it down even further to just the ducks and the shield.
    \r\n\r\ni wonder if moving the crest to a different location with respect to the
    word mark would make a difference???"

  body: Ok. Fair enough. What if you moved the shield to the right? Might be nice
    to make an instance of the logo with the type as two lines also.

  body: well, perhaps this is a boring mark, dunno. i guess i'm wondering specifically
    is the crest/mark too cramped? how can it be a bit more readable? do the letterforms
    seem even?

  body: "Mark: There is quite a lot of space behind the birds within the shield. This
    seems unbalanced to me.\r\n\r\nLogotype: The type is nice. Did you modify something?
    I really like the R.\r\n\r\nWithout seeing how you might use it is difficult to
    make any sort of judgement beyond the mark and logotype.\r\n\r\nI still think
    you should explore stacking the type. Where else will this be used?"

  body: "thanks for the feedback.\r\nit's true, the name is quite long.\r\nthe type
    is custom, not a font or modified font.\r\nthough it's certainly inspired by deco
    lettering.\r\nthe uses are pretty standard: letter, web, forms, though there might
    be some wildcards like a badge or sticker...\r\ni wanted to keep it simple at
    least for now--i.e. b&w, flexible relationship between mark and type.\r\nthe balance
    starts to get at what i see as a problem. \r\ni'll have to play around with that
    a bit."
