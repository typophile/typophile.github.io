  to be done to correct it.\r\nLookup rligRequiredLigaturesArabic02 has an offset
  bigger than 65535 bytes. This means FontForge must use an extension lookup to output
  it. Not all applications support extensin lookups.\r\n\r\nApart from that there
  are many lookups which are not working. I double checked that the combination I
  am entering in Word 2010 is perfect.\r\nPlease help."
