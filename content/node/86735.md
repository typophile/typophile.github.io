    i don't have those kind of clients . . . which is why I am now modifying the text
    in sign painter to suit my needs\r\n\r\nIs the subject of a \"script font\" that
    doesn't include several hundred ligatures and alternate characters pushing all
    of type-savvy members away? While these fonts may take less technical skill to
    design and don't demand the sophisticated performance of a sans or serif workhorse,
    they certainly have a way of complementing their more rigid ccounterparts and
    bringing interest to a block of text. \r\n\r\nMy \"bowl scraper\" needs the perfect

    sense of proper behavior when you begin to make disparaging remarks.
