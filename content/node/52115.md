    type, and the box (which will have colour, I'm just working bw so far.)\r\nI'm
    a bit worried 'bout the relationship between the box/cross and the type when unwrapped.\r\n\r\nMy
    client is a pentecostal church, young adults/youth. "

    would try using 3 (or more) different colours.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Thanks. Animation is part of the concept, as well as physical objects. I'm
    having some weight problems with the letters. They seem somewhat uneven in my
    eyes, and that T needs to be balanced better.

    \ then when I realized which one of those two was actually written here, my heart
    was filled with sadness.\r\n\r\nI like the boxes though.  the formerly <em>Nitro</em>
    boxes, which are now just plain old boring <em>intro</em>boxes.\r\n\r\n:-)"
