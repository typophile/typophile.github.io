body: "I have started to experiment with code to support special glyph forms based
  on shapes of neighboring glyphs. For example:\r\n\r\nRound Left, x, Round Right\r\nRound
  Left, x, Flat Right\r\nFlat Left, x, Round Right\r\nFlat Left, x, Flat Right\r\nDiagonal
  Left, x, Round Right\r\nDiagonal Left, x, Flat Right\r\nDiagonal Left, x, Diagonal
  Right\r\nRound Left, x, Diagonal Right\r\nFlat Left, x, Diagonal Right\r\n\r\nNote:
  x= is the glyph to be modified\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nRound Right = o,b,e etc\r\nRound
  left = o,d,q etc\r\nFlat Right = n,d,u etc\r\nFlat Left = n,b,u\r\nDiagonal Right=
  v,w,y\r\nDiagonal Left= v,w,y\r\n\r\nI understand how to do the classes now but
  I am not sure in a calt expression how you would best order things. I suspect that
  you would pick a standard say for instanace 'Flat' and make that the default. Then
  it's a matter of making the class' for Round, Diagonal, and for ligatures and special
  cases. That is fine.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't seem to be able to do is to effectively
  figure out is what is the smart way of doing this.\r\n\r\nThis is what I did so
  far was this. I did it for an 'f' whose crossbar I am altering gently. It seems
  to be working. \r\n\r\nsub @rnd.rt f' @rnd.lft by f.rnd.bth;\r\nsub @rnd.rt f' @flat.lft
  by f.rnd.lft;\r\nsub @flat.rt f' @rnd.lft by f.rnd.rt;"

  body: "On first read, what you have there seems fine. Once you get all your variations
    in there, maybe some trouble would reveal itself -- but I think what you're sketching
    out here is basically simple.\r\n\r\n<em>But</em>... things will get squirrely
    pretty fast if you're going to change the third glyph after the second one changes.
    Will the third glyph's change affect what the second glyph should be? Then you'll
    have a sort of reverse cascade. Ow. My head is hurting now.\r\n\r\nThis is the
    kind of thing that can drive one crazy when figuring out contextual substitution.
    Perhaps you don't intend to get that sophisticated about it, which would save
    you a lot of trouble!\r\n\r\nAs a general remark, I once read something about
    programming (which might be elementary to any programmer, but maybe not so obvious
    to font developers): Concentrate first on writing code that just works, without
    worrying about efficiency or elegance. Once you have something that does what
    you want, you can then turn to distilling the code into something more efficient
    or less messy."

  body: "Thanks Christopher! Happily there are only a few glyphs that I think benefit
    from this kind of treatment but yes, it is the combinations that could get me.
    Things like a the double o where the second o changes and is followed by for instance
    an f. I think that probably just expanding the class' members should sort out
    any problems but I can imagine an unforeseen circumstance biting me later. Next
    time I will probably sketch out a list of likely targets/combinations ahead of
    time!\r\n\r\nHas anybody else been down this road already?"

    might be good to make \"round left\" the default, as that will come in handy for
    when there is no lower case letter to the left-- e.g. following a capital, figure,
    punctuation or space. "

  body: "Yes you did. Thanks for the reminder! This thing is not actually a script
    but I imagine the code there will be useful all the same.\r\n\r\nI will post some
    examples when it's starting to gel enough to make sense."
