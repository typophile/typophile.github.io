body: "This is the very first stage, about 7 or so hours, of my senior project. I
  would appreciate any feedback. My inspiration for has been blackletter. It is roman
  semi-serif though. I didn't want it to have the characteristics of blackletter or
  even the feeling of it, just used as inspiration.\r\n\r\n1>  this is a miniscule
  h. I've only done a partial uppercase roman alphabet before. ( if it sucks, tell
  me )\r\n2>  this is very preliminary, please excuse any dirty edges\r\n3>  specifically,
  i'm not sold on the upper serif on the stem ( work or no )\r\n       Sometimes I
  think it works, other times the part of me that is never happy with my own work
  says no.\r\n4>  intended to be a text face, thinking about a display version, too
  early to do that.\r\n5>  also, advice on how to develop my other weights. should
  i do one entire weight set, and then do italic and bold/light/small              \r\ncaps
  from that, or should they be developed side-by-side?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "I'm a newbie working on a blackletter-related project of my own right now,
    so maybe my insights will be of some use to you. Before I say anything else, though,
    I have to say one letter's not much to go on. You probably knew that already,
    though, right?\r\n\r\nRemember that the German name for blackletter translates
    as \"broken letter\", which means that the calligraphic articulation in the letter
    forms is very strong, and stroke changes are often dramatic and irregular. Right
    now, there's some sort of conceptual breakdown happening between the left side
    of your h, which reflects this understanding, and the right, which is more like
    a traditional antiqua. The foot on the right stem makes the entire stroke feel
    a lot heavier than the stroke on the right, because it's so stolidly planted and
    the serif is so heavily bracketed. Also, having the calligraphic tail on the left
    pointing up conflicts with the flat orientation of the serif. You might be able
    to resolve this conflict by slimming the right stem, but that might unbalance
    the whole letter.\r\n\r\nI think the real solution is to figure out how to get
    the two feet to work together, either by making them more similar, or by making
    it clear in the design that they're supposed to be so dramatically different (the
    way that some of those postmodern remix fonts use obvious discontinuities to show
    you, the viewer, that they know they're a bizarre mixture of Bodoni and Helvetica,
    or whatever). What you have right now is kind of a camel, and needs refinement."

    though. A typeface is a \"beautiful collection of letters, not a collection of
    beautiful letters.\" Try this out across a few words, post that, and you'll probably
    get better feedback. If you post it in the \"Crtique\" section, you'll probably
    get more eyes, too.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    with other \"imaginary\" forms that don't yet exist. Its the getting the combination
    to work right that is the magic. Try it out. You don't need to make a complete
    lowercase. Try a word with lots of different \"parts\" in it, like \"adhesion\"
    or \"absicht\" (or anything, really\u2026)\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "I agree with Forrest that there's a detachment between the two halves of
    that \"h\" - that's the first thing I thought of when I looked at it. And yes,
    one thing you could do is reduce that, either by changing the terminals (which
    might however tame the original concept too much), but also possibly by changing
    the connection from the arch to the stem - like making it flow into the stem instead
    of having such an abrupt join.\r\n\r\nBut I can see another approach too: make
    a font that looks intentionally \"hybrid\". This might make extra sense here because
    your source of inspiration (blackletter) is looking largely absent now to be honest
    - and if it DID inspire you somehow it might be smart to make its presence stronger*.
    But if you try this route, be careful of one thing: that the result doesn't look
    like it was made in the 90s!\r\n\r\n* Look at the Fraktur subcategory of blackletter
    to see an old-school hybrid in action.\r\n\r\nAs for the funky head serif, I think
    it could work, but maybe try to make it more like the bottom-right foot serif
    (which might also help tie the two halves together better, if you decide to go
    that way).\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, make more glyphs! Although a single glyph can be a
    firestarter, a font is like a little machine, a car engine, and you need a lot
    more than a spark to get it going places!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Yea,\r\n\r\nThat first post kicked my butt... I gotta get my stuff together.
      I've already chucked that foot on the lower right,( replaced w/bracket similar
      to top )  I've got my h,i, and working on k, c, o , p , r, then I'll repost.
      \r\n\r\nI think i'm going to pull that pdf. I'm embarrassed I posted that.\r\n\r\np.s.
      Hrant, if it makes a difference. I'm trying to do blackletter inspired, not
      something that looks kind of blackletter, kind of not, but I will take the advice
      under consideration.\r\n\r\np.s.s. - 5.19.05 .. \r\n\r\nHave decided to freeze
      the current 4 or so letters I have, as they are beginning to look conspicuously
      like letters from an illuminated manuscript. Which is NOT what i was going for.
      It seems my subconcious is doing the talking. I was flipping through Goudys'
      'alphabet', and ran across something. \r\n\r\n\"the craftsman must master the
      basics before he can focus on something new\"\r\n\r\nwhich is what I was coming
      to myself. I was trying to hybrid something, and I've never even done a complete
      set of Roman. So, not only was I being pretentious, I was in over my head. SOOOO...
      I'm going to do an old-style roman. Updates later."
