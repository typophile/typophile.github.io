  as I am not a type designer I'm looking for someone interested in some way of collaboration
  or taking over the project.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, let me know, so we can
  talk it over.\r\n\r\nP.S. a guy named Erik Spiekermann thinks this is quite interesting
  specimen.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/barscript.png\">\r\n\r\n"

    you do, it gets taken offline and put in the spam queue again.\r\n\r\nIf you have
    updates to add, please put them in a comment, not the initial post. Thank you."

  body: Thanks for info but then why there's an option to edit post, if it's put offline?
    Or am I missing something out.

  body: "It\u2019s not every post that goes offline when it\u2019s edited. Just some
    that the Antispam engine is confused about. \r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, it keeps
    thinking that this post is spam. So every time the post gets updated, it gets
    re-submitted to the spam checker; and each time, the checker thinks it\u2019s
    spam (even though I\u2019ve approved it several times before) and the post gets
    taken offline and put into a moderation queue for review/approval.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t
    know why it thinks this post is spam. Doesn\u2019t happen to everyone or every
    post. But it is happening to this one."

  body: I got 500 Internal server error everytime I submitted edited post, so I kept
    trying to submit it over and over thinking it's just a permanent bug. Sorry for
    trouble caused.
