  body: "it seems like <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/bryant/|Bryant
    Bold]]</strong> by Eric Olson\r\nis a very good match for \"PIZZERI\" (without
    /A).\r\nThere is a chance that /A is actually custom...\r\nin which case you might
    be able to reconstruct it using a flipped /U"

  body: Houschka Rounded is close in the overall feel, but clearly not it. Nick Cooke,

  body: No, that isn't Houschka Rounded. My A is, well, rounded, not flat-topped like
    this example.
