  that subtly hints at being Medieval and not one that is over   flamboyant and difficult
  to read.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nFree typefaces
  would be best but please suggest all - free is just a bonus.\r\n\r\nMrKerner\r\n"

  body: How subtle a hint are you looking for? You may be thinking of something like
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/cloister-old-style-b/|Cloister Lightface]] (another
    version [[http://www.p22.com/lanston/cloister.html|here]]) (and [[https://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/urw/urw_cloister_old_style_ot/|still
    another]]) or (less subtle) [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/jensen-old-style/|Jenson
    Oldstyle]] instead of a rotunda, although rotundas are highly legible.

  body: "Rotunda is good, but maybe still a bit too medieval.\r\n\r\nI guess I am
    looking for Medieval with a bit of modern too.\r\n\r\nCloister is quite nice -
    Medieval. I do like the 'e' and the 'k'.\r\n\r\nJenson could be another possibility.
    \r\n\r\nA typeface with a bit more Medieval to it would be great.  Something in
    between Rutunda and Cloister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    you might want something like Kingthings Petrock or Perry Gothic.\r\n\r\nAh, <em>here's</em>
    the type designer I was really thinking of:\r\n\r\n[[http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/]]\r\n\r\nHe
    specializes in typefaces that might be of interest, for example there is this
    rotunda:\r\n\r\n[[http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/t/typo_rotunda.htm]]\r\n\r\nAnd
    from Typodermic Fonts, there's Goodfish and Vinque."
