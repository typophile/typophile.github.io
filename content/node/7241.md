    <BR> <BR>Wow! Prince is using our discussion forums! <BR> <BR>For the record,
    I don&#39;t &#39;get&#39; your project. They want you to market stamps to the
    youth market based on specific imagery? I honestly don&#39;t know too many kids
    these days that put too much thought into their stamp buying decisions...if they
    even use stamps in the age of email, cell phones and IM. <BR> <BR>Anyways, consider
    things that change between seasons...foods, foliage, weather, holidays, the months,
    clothing, wildlife, etc.'

    an idea: kids don&#39;t think about stamps <i>at the moment</i>, but maybe this
    is exactly the type of project that can <i>get</i> youth to spend money on stamps?
    For pre-teen girls for example, think stamps of Bratz wearing: flowery blouses,
    bikins, turtlenecks, and faux-fur with faux-naughty umbrellas. Next time the little
    insolent has a birthday party it will be a <i>MUST</i> for the invitations. The
    Post Office trips over itself this type of cr... thing. <BR> <BR>Lynn, I think
    the youth angle might very well save you from having to do something boring and
    predictable. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'As Darrel mentions most people buy stamps to post something without considering
    the look of them.  <BR> <BR>I saw an interesting product in the post office for
    invitations, weddings etc where you added a picture of your own choosing to the
    stamp &#40;unfortunately I didn&#39;t read the details of how/how much&#41;. And
    there was the series with stickers to create Mr Potato Head stamps.  <BR> <BR>Since
    speciality stamps are released as a group, are relatively short print run and
    rarely kept &#40;except by collectors&#41; you might have trouble persuading anyone
    to buy all the seasons at once, maybe you could produce a set of stamps, 1 for
    each price, for each season to be rolled out over a year '

  body: actually i think many ppl including me dont bother what the stamps r like
    as long as they can make the letters send out.  <BR> <BR>i also find that my ideas
    of making the images with the four seasons on r that a good idea,but i really
    dont know what else i can get at the moment,totally lack of ideas...<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: 'here ive got the brief: <BR> <BR>brief: <BR> <BR>design a set of stamps that
    responds to the appeal for a more contemporary, forward-looking approach in stamp
    subject and design. The aim is to give the stamps an immediacy and relevence and
    that will attract a new and younger audience. The choice of subject is you wish
    to represent is open: it can be global or national, specific or general, it can
    have a purpose&#40;e.g. awareness-raising&#41; or make a current/topical events
    or interest&#40;e.g. a celebration&#41;. The choice of subject is yours but the
    treatment and execution should demonstrate a fresh approach. <BR> <BR>market:
    <BR>-a stamp is a receipt for a service and is available to anyone within the
    UK wish to use the postal service. <BR> <BR>-bear in mind the public look to the
    Royal Mail to mark in time significant occassions, events etc. <BR> <BR>-this
    service covers the globe and therefore the stamp is an ambassador for the UK when
    travelling to overseas destinations. <BR> <BR>-a new and younger generation of
    stamp collector'

  body: Don&#39;t try to shoehorn your initial thoughts to fit the brief. Maybe you
    could approach this as a non-image project and use shapes. Since Royal Mail now
    produce pre-gummed stamps in booklets they can be any shape you want, I was thinking
    of letters, using the crenellated edge to identify them as stamps. You could also
    investigate holograms or lenticulars. <BR>Tim

    yellow for summer, russet for autumn, blue for winter. <BR> <BR>Alternatively,
    you could do a modern interpretation of a Rothko: two/three uneven horizontal
    stripes of colour in seasonal shades. <BR> <BR>Contemporary, and not done before
    I don&#39;t think. Not mould-breaking, but interesting.'

  body: i think maybe i need to give up the idea about the season.if the brief needs
    more depth in it,im not sure season can deal with that. <BR> <BR>im trying to
    think of several ways to talk about british ecological environmental issues,e.g,animals,trees..etc
    coz it requires to do minimum four stamps. <BR> <BR> <BR>ive got an another idea,the
    woods in UK have been damaged a lot and it now covers only two percent of the
    country,what my aim is to encourage ppl to protect or maybe plant trees.but my
    target audiences are now children&#40;the earlier aware of protecting trees the
    better&#41;,the images of the stamps might be the childish cartoons,also in four
    seasons,spring plant a tree,summer it grows etc which is linked to the seasons
    but not just about seasons. <BR> <BR>well this is just a rough idea im thinking
    of,its a process shows that we&#39;ll live in the desert if the trees are all
    disappeared,but the meaning is not clearly enough in the stamps. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/53767.jpg"

    cartoons are the way to go, it&#39;s a bit Blue Peter. I would look for a tie-in
    with a charity &#40;I believe there is a plant-a-tree one&#41; advertise their
    website, or include an acorn/seed with the stamp book. <BR>Tim
