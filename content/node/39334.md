  am looking to put together about 6 different options...\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
  of that fantastic long forgotten serif font that\r\ncan be dragged out and used

    Style and Silverado have in common a very \"oldstyle\" look, they sound out of
    date.\r\n\r\nconsider le monde livre, angie, bullen, collis, fedra serif, charter,
    maiola, goodchild, the serif... these are contemporary, they have a personnality,
    some are real serif, some are slab. \r\n\r\ndr"
