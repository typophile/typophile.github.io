    convertor available, but it still <BR>leaves a lot of metrics out. <BR> <BR>I
    think you gotta regenerate in FontLab or FOG. <BR>But I&#39;m not sure of the

  body: ' Well, I know how to convert &#40;at least in Fog &amp; it usually works,
    but it&#39;s the long time I hate &amp; the fact that I can&#39;t check the fonts
    myself. I work on a mac &amp; even though i&#39;ve bought Virtual PC to be able
    to check the fonts on the PC I get confussed since I find the Windows system so
    unlogic. <BR> <BR>I guess what I&#39;m really looking for is <BR>step-by-step
    tutorial or just a few sentences on  <BR>what setting to use to generate a perfect
    Latin type family. And to be sure that it will work once  <BR>generated. <BR>
    <BR>Anyone got an idea? <BR> <BR>/peter '

    a friendly typefoundry like Fountain, force them to distribute your fonts and
    leave a very friendly swede with the problem of conversion by only giving him
    the fog files :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hihi, sorry, but i just had to post this! '

  body: Okay, so i&#39;m running WinXP FLab6 &#40;just for background info&#41; I&#39;m
    wondering how best to create font files for Mac. Have the bugs mentioned in this
    thread been worked out of Transtype? Can I create Mac Versions of Win fonts all
    on my PC using Transtype? How come I can&#39;t just export Mac versions of fonts
    from FontLab?
