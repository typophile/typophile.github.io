  using familiar fonts bundled with various operating systems and programs. And also
  a few unfamiliar (to them) text faces for contrast.\r\n\r\nI know Franklin Gothic
  is known as a newspaper & advert headline face, but since it also comes with a lighter
  weight, is it ever suitable as a text face?\r\n\r\nTo me it looks businesslike,
  certainly not elegant, but preferable to Arial, for instance.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: Franklin Gothic is perfectly suitable for text as long as you choose the right
    weight and point size. I use 9.5 pt. ITC Franklin Gothic Std Book Condensed for
    short articles and sidebars. I will choose it, News Gothic or Trade Gothic over
    Helvetica or Arial every day of the week.

  body: "Franklin Gothic works for short text, as others have commented. For longer
    text, I prefer News Gothic or Benton Gothic/Benton Sans over Trade Gothic. However,
    I haven't examined the Trade Gothic Next series, which might be improved.\r\n\r\nWouldn't
    really use any of them for extended reading. More like sidebars and box text."
