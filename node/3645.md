    sure anymore... it really is too small.

  body: Yeah, that darn sure looks like it. The only thing that  <BR>bugs me is the
    linked &#34;.de&#34; on the home page. Do you  <BR>think they used the same face?
    Because that&#39;s <i>not</i>  <BR>Adobe Jenson. <BR> <BR>Are you happy with Mark&#39;s
    ID, Edward?

  body: The &#34;.de&#34; appears to be a Garamond. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/garamond-no-5/ef-light-italic/testdrive.html?s=.de&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Garamond No. 5 Italic</a> is pretty close.

  body: Thank you very much!  <BR>It&#39;s only the &#34;B&#34; in that text that
    doesn&#39;t look like ITC Berkeley Old Style or Adobe Jenson. Strange!
