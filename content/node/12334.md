  of all, is there a macro for a group of .vfb files that will:\r\n-Switch to \"codepages\"\r\n-View
  by Name\r\n-select MacOS Roman (and a variant to select MS windows 1252 Latin 1)
  -generate names -and lastly copy the currency (euro) to the Euro glyph position?\r\n\r\nif
  not, how hard would it be for a beginner to write something that will do these for
  me in a batch? can anyone point me in the right direction? any help would be appreciated!!!"

    It will take some scripting and piecing together, but that list is the best place
    to start.\r\n"

  body: "hasn't anybody written \"Learn Python for FontLab Fast\"?\r\n\r\nI checked
    out the Letterror mailing list and I agree that's a great resource. However, I
    need to start from the beginning and move along at a faily quick clip so i can
    get mostly over the learning curve. I keep getting stuck at <em>print \"Hello
    World\"</em>. Not because that's hard, but because I want to skip past that to
    something useful in terms writing FontLab macros and don't know what point to
    skip to... any other tips, anyone?"

  body: "Ah, no the \"Learn Python for FontLab Fast\" doesn't exist. However, here
    are the links that I'm always referring to when I'm working on a script:\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://dev.fontlab.net/flpydoc/\">FontLab Python</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/2.3.5/\">Python
    2.3 documentation</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/code/robofab/objects/model.html\">RoboFab
    Object Model</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://mail.letterror.com/pipermail/fontlab-scripting/\">FontLab
    Scripting Archive</a>\r\n\r\nand lastly, the [[RoboFab]] documentation which will
    be in your RoboFab folder (if you have it installed) here: Documentation/robofabDocs/robofab.html\r\n\r\nA
    quick plug for [[Typgraphica]], there is a quick <a href=\"http://typographi.com/000978.php\">article</a>
    up there now, which I wrote, that details an introduction to RoboFab. \r\n\r\nQuickly,
    however. There are two things here. The first is a need to know something (and
    only a little something) about programming. O'Reilly is a good source of books
    on programming languages and theory. They have several good python books to get
    you up to speed. The second is the fontlab specific python. Personally, I find
    that using RoboFab can help speed things up a great, great deal. The FontLab python
    interface isn't as clean or intuitive as the RoboFab one.\r\n\r\nExample. Today
    I wanted to copy only the side-bearings from one of my fonts to another. Sounds
    simple, but trying to do it by exporting AFM files and the like doesn't work,
    as you import widths that you don't want. So in about 15 minutes I wrote this:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n#FLM:
    Copy Font Side-bearing\r\n\r\n#Imports\r\nfrom robofab.world import OpenFont,
    CurrentFont\r\nfrom robofab.interface.all.dialogs import Message\r\n\r\nfontToChange
    = CurrentFont()\r\norignalMetricsFont = OpenFont(None, \"Which font's sidebearings
    do you want?\")\r\norignalMetrics = {}\r\n\r\nfor glyph in orignalMetricsFont:\r\n[tab]orignalMetrics[glyph.name]
    = [glyph.leftMargin, glyph.rightMargin]\r\n[tab]print orignalMetrics[glyph.name]\r\norignalMetricsFont.close()\r\n\r\nfor
    name, metrics in orignalMetrics.iteritems():\r\n[tab]if fontToChange[name]:\r\n[tab][tab]fontToChange[name].leftMargin
    = metrics[0]\r\n[tab][tab]fontToChange[name].rightMargin = metrics[1]\r\nfontToChange.update()\r\nMessage('Done
    changing side-bearings')\r\n</code>\r\n<strong><em>Replace [tab] with an actual
    tab</em></strong>\r\n\r\nMuch, much easier to do this in RoboFab than it is through
    FontLab's python. Or by hand."
