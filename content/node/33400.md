body: "Hi\r\nDoes anyone know of a comparison of languages in terms of how much space
  they occupy in text? I once designed a bilingual annual report, with both norwegian
  and english text. The  english part was an unabbreviated translation of the norwegian
  version. \r\n\r\nWhen i started the project, i figured the norwegian version would
  need more space. It turned out the opposite was true. \r\n\r\nAn index for different
  languages would sure be useful, especially when planning larger projects. it could
  look like this (i set english=100)\r\n\r\nGerman    =     112\r\nEnglish   =     100\r\nNorwegian
  =      93\r\n\r\nOf course, this wouldn't apply for poetry etc, and i guess there
  would be differences between e.g. fiction and scientific litterature.\r\n\r\nalex"

    language is the most compact, as it is using native words for native ideas.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a table of lengths for translations from English <a href=\"http://www.cucumis.org/help_1_h/p_le_.html\">
    here</a>. (Note that the Asian languages at the bottom seem very compact, but
    in fact they are longer on the page.)"

    many clients I get wanting a length comparison for it.  ;-)\r\n\r\n(Neat page,
    Tom, and one I've bookmarked for future use.)"

  body: "Maxim Zhukov produced some years ago two editions of a book dealing with
    multilingual typography. I have found them helpful. There is comparative data
    about relative lengths of languages as well as commentary about special considerations
    for each language under consideration. I do not know if Norwegian is included
    [the book's at home; I'm at work].\r\n\r\nThe book is \"Typography: Polyglot\"
    (1991, Cooper Union), written with George Sadek. The second edition is \"Typographia
    Polyglotta\" (1997, ATypI / Cooper Union). It may be tough to find this many years
    on.\r\n\r\npowers"

    for the direction of translation, which typically adds ~15%.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
