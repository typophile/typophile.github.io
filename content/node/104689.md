    body: "Your reply reminds me of a story, Mr. Cooke. True story, by the way.\r\n\r\nThere
      was a mother dining with friends. She had brought her children, and her 9-10
      year old son was particularly obstreperous. She would tell him to stop his yelling,
      going to other tables & bothering people, etc., but it was just the one sentence
      & then back to chatting with her friends. The pattern happened over & over,
      and the boy kept right on making trouble.\r\n\r\nAs we finally finished our
      meal and left, I told the mother that she'd just given her son a lesson, that
      when he became  a teenager, raging hormones & all, he could ignore a woman telling
      him \"no.\""
