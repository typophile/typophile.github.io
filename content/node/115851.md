  body: "I suspect this won't be much help, because I don't know of a digital version,
    but this seems to match a film type from Photolettering Inc., called \"Grandmother\".
    It came in several versions, some with shadows, or outlines, or plain. It was
    in a catalog from 1965.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    \r\nThe closest I can come to your rimmed effect is an Antique Tuscan Condensed
    Outline by Intellecta\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/antique-tuscan-condensed/\r\nUnfortunately
    the quality of Intellecta digitization is not as good as the ones from Wooden
    Type Fonts.\r\nDon"
