body: "My mother has a hobby of making jewelry, and actually it is amazing some of
  the things that she can do. She recently asked me to design a \"chop\" for her,
  or rather, a logo of sorts that could be her signature. I think that she is hoping
  for something similar to the way that Japanese print artists have a block of wood
  that they use as a stamp, hence the word 'chop' for the wood. She wants me to make
  something simple and legible, and not to intricate, or else she won't be able to
  carve it into a piece of metal. Anyways, if someone knows of any websites that could
  be useful, with either examples or instruction, I would love to see them.\r\n\r\nI
  found this earlier, through typophile of course: http://logofontandlettering.com/"

    was just asked to design such a thing too (or rather, a logo, which would then
    need to be adaptable to work for such a tiny size). So I'll be listening intently
    for any advice as well. :)"
