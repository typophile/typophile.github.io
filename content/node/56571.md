  a book using copy from a pre existing novel. I have chosen A Clockwork Orange by
  Anthony Burgess a book I quite enjoyed. As I thought about appropriate typefaces
  I found myself at an impass, while the book was written in 1962 it is quite futuristic
  in a sense in terms of language and technology predicted in the novel. I want to
  use a nice serif typeface that was perhaps made around the 60s but has a more modern
  feel if that isn't possible then something that is modern while still being classical
  if that makes any sense at all. \r\n\r\nArcher was a typeface I considered first
  but my issue with that particular typeface is I'm not sure it relates well to the
  text perhaps in a lighter weight, I'm not sure. Thoughts?"

  body: 'Oh thankyou very much, at the moment I''m using Jensen was using Dolly but
    I don''t have the full version only regular, italic bold and light and I feel
    in order to typeset a book I need more variations. Jensen is working nicely it
    seems to suit the book more content wise but if anyone else has any other recommendations
    I am glad to experiment. '
