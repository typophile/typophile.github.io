  am a junior designer and am working on a book related to Dutch design. I am currently
  looking at different options for the typefaces I will use. I would really like to
  use Aper\xE7u for the headlines, title, chapter openers etc, but need still need
  to decide on what to use for the body text. I thought it would be nice to use a
  dutch designed typeface, as it relates to the content, and so far I have been looking
  at Swift, DTL Documenta and Arnhem. Do you guys think these could fit with Aper\xE7u
  at all? If not, do you have any other suggestions, it could be sans serif as well,
  although I was leaning more towards using a serif. (it doesn't have to be a dutch
  typeface, but it would be nice)\r\n\r\nHope you guys can give me some advice and
  maybe get a little discussion going :)"

      riccard0? I'm looking for something fresh, preferably made by an exciting (new)
      type designer or studio.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons I picked Apercu, is that
      there will also be an english involvement to the book, and using a typeface
      from either or even both countries would be a nice touch."
