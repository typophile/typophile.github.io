    the bottom of LA are curved.\r\n\r\nIf you mean an unofficial name used by antique
    collectors for this version, you should post your question in a forum for Pepsi
    collectors."

    Lubalin's Serif Gothic? Well, except for the swashy ones that is ;) The E,L and
    I are almost dead ringers..."
