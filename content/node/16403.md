body: I thought it a great idea and now I can't find it. It's along the same obsessive/compulsive/fixated
  line as the <a href="http://typophile.com/node/16383">analogue tools</a> topic (hey,
  look at MY collection of cool bits & pieces), but, hey, I like my pens & pencils
  & rulers & sharpening devices, and my office space & desk & shelves & books & etc.
  And for some ungodly reason I'm also curious about others'. So, where'd that thread
  go?

  body: I'd post but, since I'm not in school I don't really have one set up. I'm
    working at the kitchen island here at home...and at my apt in NYC it's just a
    big cardboard box with a shelf on it. :-/
