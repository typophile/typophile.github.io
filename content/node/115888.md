  Playtype.\r\nhttps://playtype.com/index.php?q=font/antwerp\r\nBut i'm really annoyed
  by its \"J\". (see jpg)\r\nI asked Playtype if there was a mistake.\r\nI got this
  quick answer : \r\n\"The Antwerp lowercase \u2018j\u2018 was designed this way.
  \r\nIt is not a mistake, in fact it helps the direction of reading and matches the
  \u2018i\u2019 better. \r\nThere will be a future version of the Antwerp font(s)
  without this detail. \r\n\r\nI'd like to use that font for a book and find it more
  distracting then helping, as it is really unusual.\r\n\r\nMy question here is :
  do you know other fonts with such 'J' ? \r\nOr is it a sort of trick to add a 'j'
  that didn't exist in the 1500s ?\r\nI have to admit that knowing that form exists
  somewhere else at some point could help me using it.  \r\nI think also that if a
  modified version is scheduled, i'm not the only one to find the 'j' awkward. ;-)\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance for your comments.\r\nStef"

    you might look at the fonts below that have some of the same feel but not that
    problem:\r\n\r\nJersey BQ from Berthold\r\nWhitman from Font Bureau\r\nMinion
    from Adobe\r\nGamma ITC from ITC\r\nHawkhurst LT from Linotype"

  body: "That feature (probably inspired by a particular section of the book \"Counterpunch\"
    by Fred Smeijers) most certainly does not help reading. Letters don't need to
    sit, they don't need to \"point\" in the reading direction, and making the \"j\"
    more like the \"i\" is the opposite of what one should do.\r\n\r\nIf they don't
    fix it soon, you should fix it \u2013or get it fixed\u2013 yourself.\r\n\r\nAs
    for others fonts with this feature, there are some rare historic designs that
    have it (although AFAIR more prominent in the capital \"J\") but usually much
    more subtle than this.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: In the case of Geronimo it looks like a badly placed point problem, not a
    design feature. On Nick's font it becomes more of a design element and works better
    as it alters the shape of the whole character rather than looking stuck on.
