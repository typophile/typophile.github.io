  body: "In college I worked at the school paper and we had weekly arguments with
    our printer due to their inability to consistently print the masthead in the proper
    specified color.\r\n\r\nWe finally threw up our hands and decided \"Fine,  the
    masthead will now be 100% cyan and nothing else\".\r\n\r\nSo, this reminds me
    of that. ;)\r\n\r\nGood or bad, though, I did stare at this for a good 5 minutes
    the other day when buying coffee. I can't say I ever looked at the front page
    of USA Today for that long ever before in my life, so in terms of getting my eyeballs
    to look at their paper, I guess it's a success. Not sure that's a good measure
    of success, though. "

  body: "It makes a certain sense if one watches the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=cMD7GeYptos\">video</a>,
    and in that context it clearly is anything but old fashioned, simplified or stuck
    in the 1960s. It's not a big blue dot after all: its a big dot that can be any
    colour and can also represent anything from a financial graph to a building lot
    to a baseball to a golf green. In the context of what I presume will be new colour
    coding of the physical newpaper sections and the possibilities of animation in
    the various electronic delivery formats, its a fairly clever solution and a means
    to tie the identity of the different media together while making the most of the
    different capabilities of each. \r\n\r\nWhat it isn't is a logo in the traditional
    sense: it isn't a symbol of the brand, but an active and adaptive component within
    the brand. I don't think much of it visually, but it does seem to be truly contemporary
    design firmly situated in digital media.\r\n\r\nOr rather, that is clearly what
    it was designed to be: it remains to be seen whether USA Today will use it as
    creatively as the designers intended and illustrated in the video. The beta website
    does nothing clever with it yet, just sticks it in the upper left corner as a
    static element in a single colour regardless of the colour of the subsection."

  body: "<em>\u2026it isn't a symbol of the brand\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nIt is, despite
    its dubious quality as a copyrightable trademark.\r\n\r\nNew media rules are different.\r\nFor
    instance, many of the patented features of digital device OS interfaces would
    be nothing special if they were part of a web site design.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s funny
    that a specially con\uFB01gured shape in static media is copyrightable, yet a
    specially configured animation sequence is not. And yet that is the migration
    of typographic interest, from subtleties of static form to the use of default
    static forms (classic typefaces, primary geometric shapes) that are manipulated
    in time-based media, or across multiple media. \r\n\r\nThis kind of new media
    design occurs in the space between old media, which leaves its iteration in any
    particular previous media instance high, dry, and underwhelming.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "So, tight-but-not-touching = \u201960s, overlapping = \u201970s.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the \uFB01rst USA Today logo, using Futura, was designed in 1982.\r\nFutura was
    big then, I recall many ads with huge all-cap headlines set in Futura Bold, often
    italic, Barbara Kruger style. So the choice of Futura all caps was very contemporary,
    and they\u2019ve stuck with that.\r\n\r\nOn closer inspecting the type of the
    revised logo:\r\n1. The Y has been changed from the typeface, with a deeper apex.\r\n2.
    It looks like a slightly bolder version than the standard font.\r\n\r\nIt isn\u2019t
    a tight-but-not-touching setting; critical is the space between A and Y.\r\nA
    TBNT setting would have been much closer.\r\nWolf Olins has decided to deal with
    the problematic space between A and Y by adjusting the shape of the Y, and keeping
    its spacing quite open there, and really, it has to be, to balance the space between
    T and O. \r\n\r\nIn the 1920s, the instigators of the graphic disc were Lissitzky,
    Moholy-Nagy and Tschichold:\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poelzig_4213.jpg]\r\nThey
    did stacked all bold caps too."
