  it exist as a typeface? Any info appreciated on this or other similar cursive font
  styles. Thanks!

  body: "Haha! No mindreading involved. Handsome is the first entry in the \u2018Casual
    Monolinear Script\u2019 FontList that Seb has linked to, and in my opinion, it\u2019s
    also the best match. I was too lazy to post an extra comment to elaborate, and
    just included it in the title which I had to edit anyway, in order to give credits
    to Seb. Sorry for the confusion. Now I\u2019ll have to give you credit aswell
    and edit the title again \u2013 that will teach me."
