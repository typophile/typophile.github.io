  book. I have lost the font file I used when my PC died and cant remember what its
  call. My only lead is that I might have aquired it from 1001freefonts.com but can
  seem to find it anymore.\r\n\r\nI seem to remember I shortened the serifs on the
  M slightly, but again not 100% sure\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font

  body: Bad source to get your fonts from... They have a lot of illegal fonts, that
    are by no means free... Good luck with it, you might find it somewhere to buy,
    unfortunately I don't know where. Make sure to do the right thing and acquire
    the font legally when you do find it.
