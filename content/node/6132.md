  I can license immediately? I&#39;m looking for a &#34;handwriting&#34; font that
  looks like it would belong to a teenage girl/young woman. <BR> <BR>Loopy handwriting,
  little hearts in the place of a dot of an &#34;i,&#34; perhaps someone Paisleyish
  that looks handwritten? <BR> <BR>At this point I am desperate? Any variations of
  the idea above would be most welcome.

    a teenage hand.
