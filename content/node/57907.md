  black and white, outer and inner, yin and yang, spy vs spy, you get the idea. \r\n\r\nFrutiger
  has always put a lot of emphasis on the negative space/counters. I also found this
  font named Mostra (Two) quite fitting:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra/\r\n\r\nWhat
  fonts come to mind when you think about negative and positive space? Sometimes,
  when the font is bold enough or the type is set close enough, positive and negative
  seems to switch or isn't easy to pin down. I'm looking for that sort of effect.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your input!"

    \r\nThough not in the sense of the counters \"taking over\", \r\nbut much more
    subtly. You might enjoy this lengthy \r\n(and I think very interesting) discussion:
