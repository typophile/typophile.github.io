body: "When setting dynamic text in Flash, a button on the properties window allows
  a user to \"embed\" outlines for an entire font, or various subsets thereof. This
  option doesn't exist when setting static text, though in Flash help, under \"Font
  outlines and device fonts\", it  says \"For static text, Flash creates outlines
  of the font and embeds them in the SWF file\".\r\n\r\nIt seems as if there are two
  different uses of the term \"embed\" in play here. They are definitely different
  concepts in Flash authoring, anyway. \r\n\r\nMy question is, as it pertains to,
  say, a EULA that prohibits embedding, is setting static text in a given font and
  exporting a SWF legally the same as using the embed button on the properties window
  and exporting a SWF? \r\n\r\n"

  body: "My understanding is that the two instances of embedding you refer to are
    the same.\r\nThe difference is that when you make a static text field, flash embeds
    only the outlines of the characters used. While when you use a dynamic text field
    you have to decide which range of characters should be embedded. This makes sense
    since the flash cannot know what text you are loading into the textfield. You
    can see this by generating a size report when publishing the Flash.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    general: yes.\r\nIn most cases \"static text\" is the lesser evil, but it is still
    \"embedding\". \r\nSome EULAs are even covering the difference:\r\nH&FJ EULA:
    \u2014 Vector art (swf) Because Flash files embed actual portions of a font's
    sourcecode within themselves, our font licenses require that designers observe
    some basic safety precautions when publishing Flash files. Text in Flash files
    must be static (not dynamic), the files must embed only a subset of the character
    set, and the \"Protect from Import\" option must be enabled when the files are
    generated."

  body: "Thanks. That's pretty much what I thought the answer would be. Hopefully
    other foundries will update their EULAs in the near future to address specifically
    some of these vagaries. \r\n\r\n@Fredrik\r\n\r\nI think, as far as I've observed,
    the embedding of static text operates independent of the embedding available to
    dynamic text. For example, if I have a static text box that reads \"0123456789%
    Loade\", and I have a dynamic preloader set to something like \r\n\r\nloader.text
    = pctLoaded + \"% Loaded\"\r\n\r\nUnless I embed those specific characters using
    the embed feature, it can't draw on the characters embedded automatically via
    the static text box and will revert to a device font. This is why I thought they
    were different type of embedding. "

  body: "Eric,\r\nI've just spent most of the day struggling with making a flash file
    for a project work across most European languages. During this process I have
    found that unless I specifically instruct each dynamic textfield to embed, they
    will not make use of the embedded (range of the) font. So yes, something is at
    work regarding how the different textfield types either treat the embedded font,
    or embed the font.\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since I did this kind of work in Flash,
    but I seem to remember just adding a dynamic textfield somewhere in the file and
    specify the embedding, then all further textfields would have those characters
    available to them.\r\n\r\nF."
