  give me some tips of interesting places type or/and design wise? Any good bookshops
  with a good English section (my German is not too good)? Beautiful type on the wall?\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas would be gratefully received."

    a possibility. but dont expect too much, its a very small exhibition - near tram
    station limmatplatz, tram nr. 4 and 13.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.museum-gestaltung.ch/exhibitions/program.html
    - there's an exhibition on chinese typography in the poster room at the moment,
    and a small one about haettenschweiler in front of the museum. tram nr. 4 and
    13, tram station \"museum f\xFCr gestaltung\", its 5 mins footwalk from the first
    one.\r\n\r\nthere's the bookshop \"orell f\xFCssli krauthammer\" at marktgasse
    12 in the niederdorf (oldtown of zurich), its the biggest art books store here
    i know. not that many books specialised on type, but some. its near the station
    ratshaus, accessible with tram nr. 4 and 15.\r\nif you want english books without
    design context, there's a \"orell f\xFCssli english bookshop\" at the bahnhofstrasse
    right near rennweg.\r\n\r\ni dont have too many more ideas at the moment.. zurich
    is beautiful in the summer, take the tram 4 till the station \"tiefenbrunnen\"
    and walk all around the lake till you get to the \"sukkulentensammlung\" (a collection
    of cactii and so on), you can go even further but thats enough i think :)\r\n\r\ndo
    not hesitate to ask further questions, and i'll try to find some locations with
    interesting type on the wall."

    museum very interesting and the bookshop is fantastic. My husband was not as excited
    about the shop, though, since he ended up carrying the heavier-than-ever suitcase
    home. I think there will be a red carpet waiting for me at Orell F\xFCssli Krauthammer
    next time I visit (hopefully soon)."

    after my wife's shopping--I have also carried many a book of my own purchase as
    well :-)\r\nI might expect a Swiss Winter to be mild compared to Finland? Somehow,
    the image of Finland in Winter sounds bitter cold.  Perhaps, those cold winter
    days, you spend reading your new type books by a warm fireplace though?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Chris,\r\nWinter in Helsinki can be quite mild (+3\xB0 \u2013 -5\xB0 C) and
    damp (greenhouse effect??), at least before Christmas. The bitter cold days are
    the days when the sea is not yet frozen and with strong wind. Later, with the
    ice covered sea, we can have absolutely wonderful Winter days with sunshine and
    glittering snow, walking on the ice, skiing, sledging, some people even sit outdoors
    to enjoy their hot cocoa (or beer).\r\nMost people live in apartments with no
    fireplaces (me too, unfortunately) but good central heating and triple glazing
    make up for it. I'll get some candles out for the fireplace effect to go with
    those books ;-)"

    mild! It is a matter of aquired taste. I have aquired the taste for the 60\xB0
    to 70\xB0 mark :-)\r\nBut that hot chocolate sounds good!\r\n\r\n ChrisL"

    as Z\xFCrich last weekend. Btw, there were some mad people doing the Iron Man
    competition in Z\xFCrich last Sunday; 180 km of cycling, a marathon and 3,8 km
    of swimming to top it up, in that heat. I thought a slow stroll by the lake in
    the shade was hard enough!"
