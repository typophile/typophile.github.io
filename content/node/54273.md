  a reworking of the typeface Neue Haas Grotesk, was designed in 1957 by Max Miedinger
  with Edward Hoffmann in Switzerland.  It was originally created to compete with
  another sans-serif typeface, Akzidenz Grotesk, and quickly succeeded in becoming
  one of the world's most popular typefaces.  Helvetica is perhaps the most widely
  used typeface in signage and logos.  Its large x-height and easy legibility makes
  it ideal to use on street signs and in the corporate world of advertisement.  Helvetica
  is also responsible for furthering the popularity of sans-serif typefaces, which
  were just beginning to be used around the time of its creation.\r\n\r\nWhen I choose
  a typeface to use in a project, I consider two things: the first is the purpose
  of the project and the second is legibility.  Maybe its from growing up with two
  parents who are doctors and have horrible doctor's handwriting, but I hate having
  to work to make out what something says.  I think that if a designer takes the time
  to write something (and this of course has exceptions depending on the purpose of
  the project) it should be able to be easily read by anyone who can read.  And even
  for people who can't read, it should look aesthetically pleasing to the eye, as
  if it belongs on that street sign, label, heading, or billboard.  \r\n\r\nHelvetica
  fills all of these criteria for me.  The fact that it has so many different styles
  within its family makes it useable on almost anything modern.  It is possible to
  make a design project incredibly interesting while using only Helvetica because
  of its many styles.  I also like that it is clean, modern, and easily readable.
  \ Because I use Helvetica so much in my projects, I try not to go to it first when
  I am choosing a typeface.  However, it is comforting knowing that it is there and
  almost always sure to work if nothing else does.  I guess you could call Helvetica
  my safety net.  If I had to pick a favorite letter in this typeface, I guess it
  would be \u201CS\u201D because of its clean, curvey lines.  It just seems like a
  good example to me of how clean this typeface actually is.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I've seen some pretty good work done with Helvetica, so I wouldn't say I agree
    with Hrant. Still, I don't like the squareness of it. The "s" migt be the best
    example of what I don't like about Helvetica.

  body: I posted this blog back at the beginning of the semester and have since been
    introduced to other sans serif fonts that I've ended up liking more than Helvetica.  However,
    I agree with Frode Frank in that some pretty cool stuff can be done with Helvetica.  As
    I stated above, I am particularly attracted to its versatility.  However, I am
    still in school, so I am still learning about what exactly makes a good and effective
    font.  Thanks for the comments!!

    the one in the picture, honestly I'm really not sure.  Found it on Google and
    thought it was really neat.)

  body: My favorite thing about Helvetica has to be the "a". I feel that Helvetica
    has this integrity that Arial doesn't possess and for me, the letter "a" embodies
    everything that makes Helvetica great.

  body: "FWIW, some people feel that the tail of Helvetica's \"a\" is one of the font's
    weakest features. I personally think the upturn in the middle horizontal is worse.
    If memory serves both those were fixed in Unica. But frankly those flaws pale
    in comparison to the font's overall horrid tightness. GGL's characterization of
    Helvetica remains the most apt I think (although Spiekermann has done a great
    job of that too).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
