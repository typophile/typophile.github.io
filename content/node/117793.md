    the ZIP file, that font for Real Madrid 1998-1999 was missing. Maybe you can contact
    the designer directly.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22RbG4qCnCI"

  body: "I found [[http://fontfootball.blogspot.com/2013/09/font-vector-real-madrid-2000-2001-kit.html|a
    site]] that apparently sells the football fonts. It has this as the 2000-01 Real
    Madrid jersey font. They sell vector art of the letters and numbers, but apparently
    also have the font as a .ttf file if you want that.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
