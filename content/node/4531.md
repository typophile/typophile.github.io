  body: after a dispute with major record labels, MTV Europe has no music video&#39;s
    to show, so they are having to resort to graphic designers, we are the new rock
    and roll!

  body: Nice Jim! The groninger museum is pretty cool &#40;both architectually and
    its contents&#41; and well worth a visit for anyone who is next visiting the netherlands.
    Perhaps worth it alone for the mosaic staircase! <BR> <BR>&#40;oh... http://www.groninger-museum.nl
