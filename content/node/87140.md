body: "The first draft of this post for [[http://arabictype.wordpress.com|my blog]]
  was completed in April. However, the graphics needed for the post, among other issues
  stood in the way of publishing it.\r\n\r\nIn this article I try to explain to the
  young Arabic font designer three areas that require attention in font design:\r\n\r\n<ol><li>
  Readability</li><li> Aesthetic principles</li><li> Style</li></ol>\r\n\r\nI analysed
  the elements of Arabic type style and identified the following factors:\r\n\r\n<ol><li>
  Overall form</li><li> Contrast</li><li> Treatment of outline and ends</li><li> Weight</li><li>
  Oblique</li><li> Width (condensed/extended)</li></ol>\r\n\r\nUsing morphological
  analysis, I constructed a table that could help in generating Arabic font styles
  by varying the degree of the style elements I list above. Being the second day of
  Eid, I offer the table as a [[http://arabictype.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/arabicfontgenerator.pdf|downloadable
  goodie]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arabicfontgeneratorsmall_4345.jpg]"
