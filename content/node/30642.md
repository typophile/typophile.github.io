  Show Print is not technically a museum, but a sort of living museum/business/printer/etc.
  I think it is worthy of adding to the Typowiki, but under what category?"

  body: that's the thing about categorizing things, sometimes you have to shoehorn
    things into categories where they don't quite fit, or make a new category. How
    bout one for printshops?

  body: "From personal experience (and lots of knowledge of Hatch; I've visited the
    shop, studied a bit with Jim Sherraden and read a lot about them), I can tell
    you that he'd be offended if he was listed as anything but a printer.\r\n\r\nJim
    is certainly an artist and there are other great artists that have been associated
    with Hatch, but they are first and foremost job printers and they are very proud
    of that and have no pretensions to anything but being great poster and art PRINTERS.\r\n\r\nAluminum
    - their work is 100% letterpress, yes, using mostly wood type, although I am sure
    they have some metal on hand as well.\r\n\r\nJoshua\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt : http://www.hewnandhammered.com

    for a day' list. Jim is about as nice of a person as one gets.\r\n\r\nHave you
    all seen the Hatch Show wine yet?:\r\n\r\nhttp://la.apartmenttherapy.com/la/entertaining/gift-idea-hatch-show-print-015059\r\n\r\nI
    haven't TASTED the wine yet, but, of course, that's irrelevant, as we designers
    never buy wine based on the product INSIDE the bottle. ;o)"
