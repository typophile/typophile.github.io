  I think the Irish Whiskey is a copperplate of some sort and maybe the 40% etc is
  Baskerville but the script and the Triple distilled\u2026 caps are beyond me.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: I think the caps lettering "TRIPLE DISTILLED..." is the same font "Jameson"
    but the light style (looks like I can see some tiny serifs). If I have to replace
    it, I would probably go with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/benton-sans/|Benton
    Sans]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/griffith-gothic|Griffith Gothic]],
    some Franklin Gothic with a vintage feeling.
