    produce it in-house.\" Anyone that's ever been in the commercial art business
    has heard that one. I'm passing this vid around to my designer buddies. Hilarious.\r\n\r\nStan"

    interactive/web design. I honestly just don\u2019t know how to deal with someone
    who wants me to work for free, will only pay a cut rate if I do get the contract,
    and makes it abundantly clear that they\u2019ll send the work to some guy in Bengaluru
    if I want wage that would allow me to pay off my student loans. And that\u2019s
    just the design firms\u2026"

    I'm seeing these customers 'winning' more often than not. "

    we have a lot of problems with \"primos\" (cousins) who have learned how to use
    photoshop and therefore can do logos, posters, websites and whatever they are
    asked for, charging 10% of the normal rate.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nwww.yagobolivar.es"

    those things when they go to a restaurant, buy a CD or have a hair cut, but when
    they are dealing with a designer, those lines came out.\r\n\r\nSometimes I feel
    like designers are worse than those guys who sell newspapers by the roadside.
    At least no one bargain with them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"
