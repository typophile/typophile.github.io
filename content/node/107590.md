  If there are two, if anyone can help identify both it would be much appreciated.
  \r\n\r\nI'm looking at it and thinking I should know what it is, but for the life
  of me I'm not too sure at all.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font_5658.jpg]"

  body: "Thank you very much Don, that's superb. The first link doesn't seem to work
    unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThat sounds like a very feasible suggestion. If I can just
    tweak the K on Romana I think it'd be a close enough approximation "
