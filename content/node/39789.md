body: "Is the consensus that the new Mac OS 10.5 is now in a proper enough state (with
  the recent bug fix) to represent how the Mac will present opentype? One of the main
  things I refer to is the way the OS reads glyphs now by unicode value? Also, any
  other proclivities in the OS that need attention regarding typography?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Chris, things have not been fixed yet. The discussion thread Ralf linked to
    happened after the code for 10.5.1 was frozen, as far as I can tell. Maybe in
    10.5.2?
