  the hand set version of Dante.\r\nWhat <em>hand set</em> means here is the first
  version of Dante, not the Monotype version.\r\nI heard that Martino Mardersteig
  actually did not like Monotype version, thus I want to compare each other.\r\n(However,
  if this is true, I cannot explain why Giovanni based the Monotype Dante for Valdonega
  project.)\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know anything about this?"

    Leipzig, but I\u2019m not sure about which version it was. \r\nYou might ask Ron
    Carpenter of Dalton Maag, who actually did Monotype\u2019s digital Dante and surely
    knows the details."

    was in London in 1991 when Dante was launched at one of the Monotype Conferences
    - it was right after I joined Monotype Typography. All I heard at the time was
    a lot of praise for the work that was done on digital version of Dante. To this
    day it remains one of my favourites. :) \r\n\r\nAs to hand set type, I remember
    Harold Berliner (who recently passed away) had cast Dante in different sizes.
    He sold his type casting equipment to someone in Switzerland if I understand correctly.
    You can contact Harold's family to find out what he might have printed in Dante.
