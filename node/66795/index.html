I'd like to learn calligraphy, especially since at some point I'd also like to do a bit of type design, and I have already come across a number of books on [[http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_st?keywords=calligraphy&rs=1000&page=1&rh=n%3A1000%2Ck%3Acalligraphy&sort=relevancerank|Amazon]] and elsewhere.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Michael. Left handed calligraphy can be a challenge, but you could also look at it as an opportunity in that coming from it with a slightly different slant (no pun intended), can also help distinguish your style. There are a number of great calligraphers who are left handed. Here is a link to a Yahoo group where a lot of calligraphers discuss various topics and you might get some good advice:

I don't care what fancy defense any apologist comes up with.

If a leftie wants to produce the illusion of traditional calligraphy,
he has to write sideways* or hold the pen upside-down, or engage in
some other contortion; I guess you have to figure out which ruse is
the least awkward for you.

In terms of books, this one is good: "Left-Handed Calligraphy", V Studley

I recommend you personally try to invent special rules for lefties.

Why does it have to be a "conspiracy of exclusion?" Hate is a pretty ugly word Hrant. Struggle is a part of life. There are many lefties out there who do damn fine work and do not whine or think the field is unfair. Some of these people were giants in the movie and advertising industry. Every leftie I have ever encountered has intimated that discovery was the best part of learning the craft... not a long term burden!

As a rightie I often have to adapt, in fact I built my diversity by using tools that do not fit into the traditional mode of execution and expression.

There are a number of books out there Michael... figure out which one works best for you. Search left-handed calligraphy.

Actually, a bit different in construction, but the basic idea is to angle the edge of the nib, relative to the stem of the pen, differently than in a regular (right-hander) pen.

I taught a calligraphy class to a group of general design students, and acquired left-handed calligraphy pens (Sheaffer, IIRC) for those that needed them, although some decided they were unnecessary. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">"Traditional calligraphy" does not designate a person, or other feeling and thinking being. As such, to say that "traditional calligraphy hates lefties" is simply a figure of speech; it is not an imputation of hatred or bigotry to the calligraphic community. When people are unfair it is blameworthy, but that life is often unfair is just a fact.

It was just a short way of stating a simple fact: attempting to write traditional calligraphic styles with the left hand in normal writing orientation will be difficult and will tend to produce poor results. There are workarounds; after all, right-handed people do calligraphy in Hebrew (traditionally by writing sideways, as Hrant mentioned) and Arabic.

If one is making a master copy for reproduction, rather than an individual original, I suppose one could actually write the mirror reflection of what one intends to produce... perhaps using a mirror to see your result!</div>

Writing these styles, the lefty is at no disadvantage or awkwardness.

On the other hand, the ability to write with both hands -- either separately or simultaneously (same text, of course, and normal, not mirrored) if one's really good -- has always been considered a high art in China, though I doubt any living CJK calligrapher is capable of simultaneous writing.

henrypijames  - What history of Chinese calligraphy are you talking about? You are probably well informed to make such a claim but the calligraphers of the Tang Dynasty (the finest years of Chinese history for me) are not documented that well except for their work.

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, we now know a lot about the way Chinese calligraphy was performed even at the time of Wang Xizhi (303-361 BC, in Jin Dynasty, which the Chinese themselves -- including later generations like those in Tang -- regard as the grand epoch of calligraphy): How people used to sit, lay out the paper, hold the brush, and so on. Many of the things we know today were unknown -- or presumed in ways that have turned out to be wrong -- a few decades ago, but recent historical and archaeological research has brought them into light.

To be clear, I'm not a calligrapher myself -- not even an amateur. But the person in my family who taught me a bit of calligraphy when I was a child is a professor of Chinese calligraphy history. He's also not the only person with professional background I discuss those topics with from time to time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Statistically, I'd say in (modern) Latin handwriting, the pen is moving left-to-right about twice as often as right-to-left (counting only on-paper time and disregarding vertical and near-vertical movement). Comparatively, LTR movement is at least four times of of RTL movement in (modern) Chinese, because the horizontal stroke ("heng"), which is the most frequent type of stroke, is always drawn left-to-right. In other words, Chinese has a much stronger (horizontal) directional bias than Latin.

		<div class="commentbody">I'd guess that Chinese calligraphy might be easier for a lefty than Latin script calligraphy.  A key reason why lefties struggle with a broad-nibbed pen is that it's difficult to find an angle that's both natural and that allows the nib to be drawn across the paper as it's designed to be.  With Chinese calligraphy the tool of choice is a brush rather than a pen, which has a flexible rather than a rigid tip and deposits ink on paper in a very different way.  And if I'm not mistaken, the angle at which the brush is held is nearly vertical, which is just as easily done with the left hand as with the right.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>I doubt any living CJK calligrapher is capable of simultaneous writing.</cite>

At a park at Chengdu, Sichuan Province, I saw a man writing on the walkway with two brushes simultaneously, one in each hand, using water instead of ink. The characters written by the left hand (I think) were mirrored, though. Unless it was the case that I happened upon the one street calligrapher in China who does that, it can't be that rare a practice, and perhaps there are even those who write normal un-mirrored characters simultaneously with both hands.

And yes, Aric, you make good points about Chinese calligraphy being more amenable to lefties. I learned some Chinese calligraphy when I was young (a bit before Korean calligraphy, actually). I had already got used to writing with a pencil, held at an angle to the page with the fingers close together and the wrist resting on the paper for support, so it was difficult to transition to holding the brush vertically with enough space maintained in the inside of my hand to grasp an egg (I think that's how they taught it). This and the fact that it's a round brush means that there is no angle bias at all with Eastern brush calligraphy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@Jongseong: First of all, writing mirrored text simultaneously with both hands is easier -- by magnitudes -- than writing normal text (which is why I emphasized "normal, not mirrored"). Second of all, writing merely readable text simultaneously with both hands is again easier -- by magnitudes -- than produce something good enough to be considered "calligraphy". For it to be a real simultaneous calligraphy, the product of both hands need to be both as good as what the calligrapher would normally produce with his normal hand -- in fact, it should be unrecognizable which sheet is written with which hand.

Lefthanded writing is tolerated fine in most cultures with RTL writing; my point is that <em>formal calligraphic instruction in any script</em> will tend to subvert lefthandedness.

The only way lefthanded calligraphy can truly flourish is to establish a distinct school that formally rejects the righthand school. A lefthander following a righthand-centric course will certainly learn much, but can never reach his full potential.

		<div class="commentbody">Individual Hebrew letters are traditionally written left to right, in the manner of a right hander primarily pulling the pen to the right and down. However, each new letter is put down on the line in the other order: starting on the right, then each new letter to the left of the previous letter. 

Hence whatever special challenges a left-hander faces with Latin calligraphy will be similar in Hebrew.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">A couple of points regarding right-to-left scripts:

The direction in which a script is <em>read</em> doesn't necessarily imply anything about the direction in which it is written. This is something one learns from watching Arabic calligraphers rotating the page and writing top-to-bottom.

Writing direction is independent of pen angle, and it is the latter factor that determines the normative patterns of letters when they are written with contrasting stroke tools, especially translation stroke tools such as broad nibs or flat brushes. One can ignore those normative patterns, of course, but the result will be that the letters look weird to most readers. Normative contrast patterns are so basic to script identity that reversing them frequently gives the impression that one is attempting to make a pastiche of a different writing system, e.g. writing Latin letters à la Devanagari.

Again, my advice to a lefty would be to look at tools (brushes, split nibs, low contrast tools) that do not enforce a translation stroke pattern, and at styles of lettering within a writing system that favour left-handed execution.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I suppose calligraphy can have nothing to do with the way one normally writes. If you learn to draw characters at 90 degrees instead of 0, then there's probably no principle that says your characters should be any worse.

@John Hudson: That's interesting John; I guess it would make sense actually. But are there any left-handers who write with LTR languages upside-down? Probably few, if any. I normally  rotate the page at about a 60 degree angle when I'm writing to avoid smudging, but I notice that John DeCollibus has more of a 90 degree angle when doing calligraphy.

Incidentally, I once had a teacher at school who thought that someone else had written my homework for me, because she couldn't believe a left-handed writer could write as neatly as I had.</div>

Forcing a leftie to write sideways or upside-down simply to exactly match what a rightie would produce is dysfunctional, and depressing.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I've been thinking about your comments in that other thread regarding writing 'naturally' vs 'contortion'. If you look at the ways in which different writing systems are written around the world, I don't think you can easily define what constitutes a 'natural' way of writing: all writing is cultural. I think it is better to talk in terms of comfort and ergonomics. In which case, it is interesting to note that the common hand position of European writing, in which the wrist is flexed backwards is less comfortable over a long period of time than what we would think of as a rotated position in which the hand is in-line with the lower arm and the wrist is not flexed. As someone who suffers from rotator cuff mobility problems and pain, I'm very much aware that there are habitual positions that are very bad for the body and that should be avoided. But I think the range of comfortable positions for writing is greater than perhaps a culturally biased notion of what is 'natural' might suggest.</div>

Oh, I beg to differ. Consider the precise motor skills that are necessary to move an arm -- not fingers, not hand, but the whole arm -- to produce accurate movements of just a couple of millimetres. It's as if the entire arm is a pantograph, translating the movement of major muscle groups into very small marks on a surface. Now consider that writing is one of the very few and by far the most common skill that requires such a capability.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, it seems a chicken and egg sort of question, whether we write the way we do because of fine motor skills that are an ‘inherent, primordial ability’ or whether we developed such an ability as we practised mark making. An adaptationist could easily make a case that being able to e.g. paint animals well on the walls of a cave would lead to greater social status and hence to both better nutrition and to more opportunities for reproduction. I'm not much of an adaptationist, though, and while I wouldn't presume an ‘inherent, primordial ability’ I would be inclined to think that there are innate potentials or capabilities that might be developed into abilities or characteristics. And we see this with regard to fine motor skills even today: we have this capability, but it must be fostered and practised by each individual, usually at quite a young age, or else it doesn't develop. This is parallel to many other innate capabilities, which we probably all have but which we lose if we do not develop them. There are no tone-deaf people among speakers of tonal languages, because they all develop their capability to produce and recognise verbal tonality at a young age; whereas speakers of English generally have much poorer tone sensitivity unless they have studied music quite seriously. Depressingly, one can imagine all sorts of innate capabilities that we might possess, but which we have neglected and lost.

I have had the English edition for many years. It was published as <em>Calligraphy</em> by Scirpus Publications in Belgium in 1996, but doesn't seem to have been well distributed. It is available in the US from the calligraphy specialist bookseller John Neal:
http://www.johnnealbooks.com/prod_detail_list/25/4

There are a couple of copies available for sale on ABE, but for more than double the retail price quoted by Neal, presumably reflecting the poor distribution and the impression that it must be out of print.

But the essence is this:  in calligraphy, the most important thing is seeing--i.e. line, slant, spacing, curve, negative space etc. --- and getting what your mind's eye envisions onto the paper.  When you approach it that way it doesn't matter which hand you write with.

I disagree. I think most (professional) calligraphers have a precise mental picture of what they want to draw, but their hands fail them in reproducing the lines from their imagination.

In fact, I believe most calligraphers are seeing to much: They tend to over-adjust their movement -- and often even their plan -- midway because seeing the partial picture (or even the current partial curve) makes them insecure about whether it's right. Maybe if they rely less on their eyes and more on the mental picture in their head -- go into a meditative trance, if you will, so as to tune down the non-stop visual feedback analysis that's messing with them, they would produce more fluent and natural results.</div>

Basically he says that if a left-handed calligrapher wants to reproduce the traditional forms comfortably, he should turn the paper 90 degrees and write the letters on their sides, arranged vertically.

My point has always been that not being able to
read what you're writing isn't "comfortable" at all.

1) The human vision system favors a horizontal arrangement far
more than vertical. AFAIR there have even been studies to show this.

2) I might <em>possibly</em> agree when it comes to traditional
calligraphy, but that "any" there is certainly too much.
Lefties do write, after all! And I believe there are forms
for them to write that are both comfortable and attractive.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I'm sure you agree that when ‘reading’ what you are in the process of writing one is not engaged in immersive reading. Indeed, insofar as one will most of the time be looking at partially formed words, one isn't really reading at all. My concern in such a situation would be whether it is easier to make spelling mistakes if one isn't looking at the text at a normal angle. I wonder? But the other thing to bear in mind is that we're not talking here about everyday writing but about calligraphy, i.e. writing as a kind of art, and a lot of practice goes into that. I doubt if the challenges imposed by having to rotate the page present major difficulties that could not be overcome with such practice.

I think taken as you present it, Noordzij's statement is simply fact. He's not saying that this is an ideal way in which to write, he's saying that if a lefty wants to produce the traditional forms of [Latin-script broad-nib] calligraphy the only comfortable way to do this in terms of the relationship of hand and pen to the page is to rotate the page. Certainly, it is a suggestion far more sensitive to the ergonomics of left-handed writing than the kind of contortions to which I regularly see lefties reduced, even if in some of those positions the page is better oriented for reading.</div>

Only if you use a very narrow meaning for "comfortable".
Separating the creation of text from its use is misleading.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, as I wrote, I don't think Noordzij is suggesting that writing with a rotated page is in any sense optimal, even in terms of comfort. He's saying that this is the most comfortable way, given both the constraints and the options, for a lefty to create these particular forms of letters. He's not saying it is some kind of perfection of comfort, but that it will be easier, less tiring and more egnomically sound to do it this way than to do it in another way.

<em>Separating the creation of text from its use is misleading.</em>

I think stating that as some kind of general rule is misleading. There are lots of different kinds of text in and on lots of different kinds of media. Arguably, the very constraints imposed by the broad-nib translation stroke make it less important for the text to be angled relative to the writer in a particular way, because the writing tool itself will largely control the stroke contrast. Being able to see letters as they will be read becomes more important in outline-drawn letters, when one cannot rely on the tool for such control.

Again, remember that we're not talking about everyday handwriting; we're probably not even talking about something like professional scribal text creation of the kind that doesn't really exist anymore outside of a couple of Urdu newspaper publishers.</div>

I tire of theorists analyzing what I and others do.

@ Hrant My first student was a leftie. I took her on more as a learning experience; it taught me that traditional approaches to my art are better left to the theorists. I cant my paper, in one style I work totally perpendicular to the paper, other times I work upside down, I both push and pull strokes, I hold my pen incorrectly etc. When I taught I always heard "You cannot do that," to which I replied, I do whatever it takes to get it done! One must adapt.

Adaptation is integral and essential to the craft. In is not an affliction to lefties only... it is necessary to "survival."

@ Henry

To me lettering is like chess. The first stroke one lays down essentially determines all that follows.

"They tend to over-adjust their movement -- and often even their plan"     (and you know this how?)

I do words, not letters. The letter knowledge is stored deep within, it is a subconscious guide, the execution is spontaneous based on THAT knowledge and the "landscape" that determines the "fit/execution."

"why some calligraphy teachers dismiss lefties"

They are scared shitless. I taught my first student from underneath a clear glass table because I could not watch the letters as she made them... her hand covered them. I adapted... to her adaptations.

"I maintain chirography can want to treat the white equally, but in
the end simply cannot."

By calligraphy's very nature one is "laying black on a white surface." One must always strive to treat the white equally, even use it to their advantage. You seem to be more obsessed with the forms themselves, if that be the case I have no solution for you. I adore traditional forms even when they are adapted to abstract. I am playing nice now Hrant. Traditional forms are what they are, Arrighi did the same thing I do. Had the same intentions. Used the same tools, basically. Was concerned with the same black/white interplay that I am.

Jokingly Michael says... if you want to take calligraphy to task beat up on the blackletter guys! No respect for white :-) And yet weren't they playing off the white, or using it as a foil?

Presumably because they are the letters of our alphabet.

Do you remember my scans of Latin letters written with rotated and reversed pen angles in an earlier thread? Not only do they look freakish, some shapes simply don't work because they are predicated on a particular angle. The shapes of letters are not abstract concepts or even skeletons to which arbitrary patterns of stroke weight and contrast can be applied. They are cultural artefacts that evolved through writing with particular tools, and their normative shapes reflect those tools and the dominant writing practices of the time in which they evolved.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, consider: most of the letters we read, write, typeset, etc. are lowercase letters. What are these? Where did they come from? As it happens, we have a huge wealth of palaeographic evidence that documents the development and evolution of these letters during the mediaeval period, i.e. a record of how these letters came to have the normative <em>shapes</em> that they have. And that evidence is pretty much entirely of minuscule letters written with a broad-nib at a fairly consistent angle. This is the crucible in which the shapes of our letters were formed, and if the tool had been different or the angle had been different, we would reasonably expect those shapes to be different. Like it or not, this does put constraints on how these letters can be written with that tool, and even some constraints on how they can be written with other tools, although changing tools always introduces new freedoms as well as new constraints.

Now, why would a lefty want to go to the trouble of adapting to these constraints so as to be able to write these letters? I suppose there are individual answers to that, but it seems to me that most people who want to take up calligraphy, regardless of their handedness, do so because they have seen and been inspired by works of calligraphy. Since calligraphy, in every scribal culture I can think of, is a deeply traditional craft, mastering historical exemplars is one of the things that is both expected and, I am sure, one of the things people want to do when they sign up for calligraphy courses.

Conversely, if one wants to invent new ways of writing, without learning to master traditional styles, one might as well just stay at home and start playing with tools and media. Don't go to a teacher if you're not interested in the thing that the teacher is able to teach you.</div>

But sometimes he will teach you something in spite of himself!
Everybody has something to teach anybody, but any student
necessarily has to filter and repurpose what the teacher says.

When I took that calligraphy class I was smiling and learning
the whole time. But I wasn't smiling about or learning what
the teacher thought I was (which, if he's an ideal teacher, he
wouldn't mind at all).

small piece I did at the end that class:

This might go without saying, but: brutal honesty preferred.

Well, you've always been wrong about that. Self-expression is one particular purpose of some art; it's also a fairly recent, romantic view of art, which cannot explain most of the art that has been made in most of the world throughout most of human history. Art expresses many things, and many of these, e.g. nature, culture, are very much bigger than the self.

An art that only expresses the self, frankly, isn't up to much. I've been trying to find the passage in one of Bringhurst's essay where he says something to this effect, but perhaps his conclusion is all that needs to be stated: art can express the world. He and I happen to live in a place where art of the aboriginal inhabitants demonstrates this in particularly powerful ways. But a walk around any museum in the world will quickly convince you that art is expressing more than the paltry self of the artist.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I concede that art doesn't only express, and there is expression beyond art.
And it's certainly true that any expression goes beyond the self. In fact I've
often said that there is no pure art (or pure anything).

My wording was sloppy/rushed. Basically I guess what I was getting at
is that a leftie who is mainly interested in following in the footsteps of
righties is a largely boring an irrelevant person.

Hrant said...To me calligraphy is now art,

In a sense you are right. Today it is self indulgent and ill informed, in a lot of cases, and for the most part reminiscent of post pubescent rebellion. To be quite honest, it is an affront to the black and white interplay that you and I dance around.

As to your example Hrant, it is an admirable representation for a new student. I am not going to nit pick because I see it for what it is, an valiant effort. Could it become a typeface... sure, if you made some adjustments. Is it good calligraphy... it is certainly a great start. However, as a nun, I would have rapped your knuckles with a ruler for the flourish on Verona... Just kidding Hrant :-)</div>
