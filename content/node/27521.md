body: "I'm working on a website design, and I'm currently looking with my client for
  a font for headings graphics throughout the site.\r\n\r\nOne of the fonts we considered
  is Bannikova from Paratype, but in my eye something is wrong with the digitization.<!--break-->
  It's a beautiful and very unique Soviet typeface designed by Galina Bannikova in
  the 1950s.\r\n\r\nI'll let you guys judge whether the quality is good enough for
  use in a design (with a little manual kerning). Once again, it's only for some headings
  to be read on screen. I'd also like to hear suggestion for similar typefaces.\r\n\r\nHere
  are a couple images:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bannikova2_6636.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bannikova_4625.png]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe
  corresponding Identifont page: <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?GG\">Link</a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nI'm
  especially drawn by the beautiful serifs and \"organic\" letterforms."

    but the lowercase a is maybe too cuddly for my liking (Sorry, I may be punctilious)."

    part.

    a deadline and I'm relatively happy with the book weight of Bannikova. I don't
    only need to tweak the kerning, I even have to position some of the letters vertically.
    Like, consider the uppercase \"B\" <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=PG.109426.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Bay+City&sampleSize=48\">in
    this example</a>.\r\n\r\nBy the way, here's how Bannikova was probably supposed
    to look before digitization: <a href=\"http://babich.spb.ru/pics/lj_pix/Bannikova/Baikonur1b.jpg\">Link</a>
    (I only need the western alphabet, though)."

    body: "We don't have the C in native Finnish words.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase \"k\"
      is also \"cuddly\" but retains a sort of dignity.\r\n\r\nIt's only 10-15 heading
      images around the website. Screen typography is so easy because of the low resolution,
      it's mostly only a question of style. Don't have to worry that much about legibility
      problems, eye flow or stuff like that."
