  the two english essays in  <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/person/hartz/sem/l/"
  target="_blank"> Sem Hartz</a> otherwise dutch <i>Essays</i> for the last two weeks.
  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a beautiful book, designed by <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/person/de-does/bram/"

  Hartz own <i>Juliana</i>. <BR> <BR>What strikes me is: Why is there no digital versions
  of Emergo and Juliana?  <BR>While Zapfs &#40;<i>the Master craftsman</i>&#41; designs
  are being updated and honoured these two little gems could fall into oblivion. <BR>
  <BR>Another thing, type that actually have been digitized, like Bembo, but somewhat
  lost a bit of soul in the process, who&#39;ll take responsibility to save them?!
  <BR> <BR>Do You have better examples? Do You feel like taking some responsibility?
  Am I <i>wrong</i>? <BR> <BR>'

  body: This little book is indeed a gem. My favorite thing is the actual printed
    sample of Linotype Juliana from a novel on cheap stock. &#40;Emergo btw is less
    impressive to me.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; Why is there no digital versions of Emergo
    and Juliana? <BR> <BR>One reason might be that the person who owns the rights
    to them is squatting. <BR> <BR>&#62; who&#39;ll take responsibility to save them?!

  body: The book is about BdD&#39;s work, as book designer and type designer. Not
    much theory. There are many reproductions from books he designed. I&#39;d say
    it&#39;s an historical overview of his carrer. The book is bilingual, Dutch/English.

  body: Honestly, I was a bit disappointed with it. I guess I was expecting a book
    on type design. It is not a book on type design &#40;it doesn&#39;t even show
    full character sets of Trinit

  body: Eduardo&#39;s summary accurately describes the book. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll add
    that even though it isn&#39;t a book on type design, it&#39;s <BR>interesting
    to note the relationship between PMN and BdD. <BR>PMN has half of the rights to
    Lexicon and consults closely <BR>with BdD. It&#39;s also nice the see PMN&#39;s
    interpolations against  <BR>BdD&#39;s drawings too.  <BR> <BR>I suppose the intent
    is to frame BdD&#39;s life and by doing so  <BR>cast some light on his types.
    Faults aside, a keeper in my library. <BR> <BR>But... back to Sem Hartz.  <BR>What
    do you mean by squatting Hrant?

  body: '&#62; What do you mean by squatting <BR> <BR>&#40;Sorry, I forgot to address
    that before.&#41; <BR> <BR>I mean sitting on a design with little intent/time
    to develop it, but preventing others from working on it anyway. No matter what
    the law says, a design is a cultural treasure that belongs to everybody to some
    extent - it deserves to be made available irrespective of who does the revival.

    index pages do not gain from it. <BR> <BR>And if what you say is true about Sem
    being a type squatter, that&#39;s really sad.  <BR> <BR>

    <BR>here&#39;s one person&#39;s answer to that question and his lamenting about
    a few other text faces that lost their character in the digitization process.
    it&#39;s too bad i&#39;m not familiar with the metal versions to know exactly
    what he&#39;s talking about.'

    passed away in &#39;95&#42;. But in any case designers aren&#39;t always the &#34;owners&#34;
    of their design, especially not back then&#42;&#42;. Emergo is probably owned
    by Enschede now, and I suspect they have too many interesting projects going and
    not a big enough army of capable designers! Juliana is probably owned by Linotype
    now, and they have too many fonts already.  :-/ <BR> <BR>&#42; There&#39;s a nice
