  body: No ID unfortunately. The lc &#39;g&#39; with its bulby ending  <BR>on the
    loop doesn&#39;t match anything. Anyone an idea?

  body: The g is very like Monticello, and the type is close to, but doesn&#39;t match,
    Carter&#39;s new version. You can see it by going to the Linotype site and doing
    a search, but I can&#39;t figure out how to link there. <BR> <BR>The ampersand
    isn&#39;t Monticello.

  body: Thank you very much for your help.  <BR> <BR>I think the ampersand is very
    special. Do you know a fondry und a type designer who could design such an ampersand.

    be no exact matches, but you&#39;ll come across  <BR>similar stuff. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s

  body: I would very much like to know what that font is myself, since that form of
    &#34;g&#34; &#40;my favorite&#41; is extremely rare. <BR>Maybe the older version
    of Monticello? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: The lower bowl of the g in the older Monticello is more flattened than this
    one. <BR> <BR>Another font with a very similar open g is Gustav Jaeger&#39;s &#34;Seneca&#34;,
    and of course, there is Zapf&#39;s &#34;Zapf International&#34;.

    <BR> <BR>&#62; Zapf International <BR> <BR>I&#39;d forgotten about that! Embarassing,
    because its italic &#34;g&#34;&#42; &#40;which I find superior&#41; has actually
    served as direct inspiration for me on one accasion in the past. <BR> <BR>&#42;
