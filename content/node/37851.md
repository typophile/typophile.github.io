    have to execute exactly what the client asks, even when they don't agree at all.
    Sometimes it's tough. :^)

    to guess that the 'rv' combination was not used in the cigar brand name. It's
    also possible that some of these letters are inventions to make up for gaps in
    the original lettering sample(s). Even with those excuses, I would say that the
    kerning of LHF fonts is not always what they seem to spend their time on. Maybe
    with display fonts it's assumed the graphic artist using them will 'tweak' the
    tracking as needed.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    last font I kerned had over 9000 pairs. Kerning is most definitely something we
    spend time on.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if there is a font that you purchased from
    us and you unhappy with it, we will fix it to your satisfaction. Customer service
    is also a big priority with us.\r\n\r\nThe only way I can see that you could come
    to the conclusion you have is if you are using a program that doesn't display
    the kerning correctly, such as Word or Photoshop CS. That would explain your misunderstanding.\r\n

  body: "I am glad you like most of our fonts. But I really don't care if someone
    doesn't like a font. Please reread my response more carefully and you will see
    that I was referring to Mike Yenga's assertion:\r\n\r\n<strong>\"...that the kerning
    of LHF fonts is not always what they seem to spend their time on.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThat
    is a different matter all together. I don't know how Mike knows what we spend
    our time on. But when I personally hand kern every single character with every
    other character, so that every single possible combination in the font has been
    covered -- that takes at least an entire day, in some cases even two. Furthermore,
    if Mike found a problem with the kerning of a font he purchased, I wish he would
    have given us a chance to make it right.\r\n\r\nThat said, it is true that some
    fonts simply don't work. And I would agree that Labelle is one of those that has
    bothered me for some time now. The characters don't seem to work well together.
    But this has nothing to do with the kerning.\r\n\r\nThe quality Letterhead Fonts
    offers is <strong>very</strong> important to me. I am removing Labelle from the
    site now (as I often do with fonts I feel aren't up to par). I will be happy to
    give any one who purchased LHF Labelle credit towards another font.\r\n \r\n--Chuck\r\nLetterhead

    to diminish the quality of Letterhead Fonts, because certain types of faces and
    especially scripts <em>do</em> require lots of kerning because of their very nature
    \u2013 the amount of kerning pairs is not automatically a reference for the quality
    of a typeface. One could argue that a font with an impressive amount of kerning
    pairs is a font that was poorly spaced to begin with. :^)\r\n\r\nThis statement
    <em>isn't by any means related to Letterhead Fonts in particular,</em> just a
    general remark for educational purposes aimed at our new users."
