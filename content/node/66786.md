body: "The idea behind this design was to use the WW2 aspect of 1939, but to also
  use something that i think would make the poster unique and in some ways original
  from all the other WW2 poster design out there, i wanted to use the battle of wuhan
  because as a designer i thought that the old japan flag during that era would be
  a tremendous design to bring to the poster, and give the poster a little something
  than just font and text, same for the american, nazi and soviet flags in the design
  aspect. \r\n\r\n1939, the beginning of World War 2, on the right side of the poster
  you will see the Japan flag with a summary of the aftermath of the wuhan battle,
  on the left side of that you will see the aftermath of World War 2 underneath the
  American Flag. Jumping out at you is the 1939 design in the central part of the
  poster which obviously declares the first year of the most deadliest human conflict
  in the history of the world. Underneath the WW2 font at the bottommost of the poster
  you will see the text is a brief summary of WW2.\r\n\r\nAnd finally on the leftmost
  side of the poster you will see the two streaks going up from the first w of the
  font, creating a perfect opportunity for me :) the designer to use it as a place
  to put the beginning and end date for the brutal war it was.\r\n\r\nColor choice
  for this was simple for me because i didn't want to use red or black because i dont
  want to people perceive the idea of violence that was indued in the war, however
  red was used slightly \r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/47008322@N03/4313222280/\r\n\r\nThank
  You!"

    shouldn't it be \"deadliest <em>six</em> years\"?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I like your concept, although the poster reminds me of one of the olympic
    games posters, although at the moment I can't really specify which one. \r\n\r\nI
    like the subtle hints in the design (like the flags etc.), but I'm wondering if
    there isn't a more 'appropriate' font for the numbers. \r\n\r\nBut overall, nice! "

  body: "I might be going too deep here, so hold me back. But, I must be blunt, the
    poster is politically incorrect.\r\n\r\nHaving the US flag next to the date year
    '1939' suggests that the US partook a role in the war since that time. The date
    for US involvement was actually from December 7th 1941. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor).\r\n\r\nThe
    references to Russia VS Germany is also incorrect. Both of these countries were
    allies (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland).\r\n\r\nAs for the design,
    please see anything on 'Vkhutemas' or 'Bauhaus' school of thought. Both schools
    had tremendous impact on propaganda in communist Russia and fascist Germany.\r\n\r\nGood
    climate overall.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/File-Artwork_by_El_Lissitzky_c1930_4019.jpeg]\r\n\r\nRussian
    Exhibition in Zurich - Poster by Eli Lissitzky.\r\n\r\nP.S. Violence during the
    war is not offensive, it is a fact. To disacknowledge it is offensive to those
    who suffered.\r\n"
