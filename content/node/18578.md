    Sirenne</a> was inspired by similar map lettering of the 17th and 18th centuries.
    Otherwise you have to look to the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=8&displayfontid=C.995.0.0&fontRendererText=Gardening+Issue\">Bodoni</a>s,

    and other modern serif italics. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=UR.109787.0.2&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Gardening+Issue&sampleSize=32\">Craw</a>
