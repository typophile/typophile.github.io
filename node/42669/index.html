<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Can anyone point me as to where I should research complimentary typefaces? I am working on a huge contract designing custom photo albums evocative of coffee table books such as one would buy at the giftshops in museums. So the typefaces need to have a classic quality to them, they can be both classic fonts and modern streamlined fonts depending on the theme of the albums, be it weddings or births.
Finally, does anyone recognize the fonts used in Martha Stewart's everyday food magazines?
Thanks ever so much.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>You mean, like, fonts that tell you how good you look? Or do you mean complementary?
You didn't specify which parts of the MS magazine you wanted ID'd, but I know the ones I've seen use a lot of Gotham and Whitney, both from <a href='http://www.typography.com"'>H&FJ</a>. Good luck.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, if I used the right fonts for the mock albums, they would make me look good, no?
You're right - complEmentary fonts - that's what I'm looking for.
For the Martha Steward EveryDay Food magazines, I am looking at the September 2003 issue. It's a nice light font with slight serifs - rather friendly looking. Ideal for baby albums, I think.
Thanks in advance.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Archer is not actually H&FJ's "newest" type family for Martha, just the most recent one that they're finally able to release for public license. Archer was designed back in c.2002. The Walbaum-ish serif face that they designed for <cite>Martha Stewart Living</cite> is newer (can't remember the name offhand), but isn't available for license. But I suppose I'm just nitpicking semantics.
Martha's <cite>Everyday Food</cite> magazine uses Whitney pretty much throughout, almost exclusively. There are some numbers that look like Clarendon or Belizio (or perhaps custom from H&FJ in the same vein). But otherwise, Whitney Whitney Whitney. Unless something's changed in the last several months since I looked at a copy.

<div class=commentbody>Oh, sorry, didn't see your post about 2003 until after I posted mine. They may not have had the Whitney fonts in 2003. I don't have a 2003 copy around, so I can't say. Sounds like it might be Archer, which they were still getting a lot of mileage from in the Living series. I wouldn't be surprised if they launched Everyday Food in the same fonts as Living to piggyback on the brand, and only later distinguished it by shifting fonts. (I have a 2005 issue in Whitney as I described.)
If you posted a scan, I'm sure we could ID the 2003 fonts for you.

<div class=commentbody>If you want museum art-book elegance, that's easy: Linotype Sabon with oldstyle figures (or the Adobe OpenType version), and, very selectively, Linotype Syntax with oldstyle figures. Sabon is very popular for museum displays and catalogues: in my view, it is the most nearly perfect serif there is. And Linotype Syntax is superior because its base weight is not too heavy, as with so many other sans families. Just remember the oldstyle figures--always makes a really nice difference. In my experience, Sabon looks best set 11/15.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bizarre coincidence - I am using Linotype Syntax for the smaller captions - looking up Sabon right now - yep, I have it. Thank you for the suggestions.</div>

Darden and Maag foundries have type testers where you can set up two (or more) types beside one another.
Reminds me of type specimens where the pages are cut horizontally into three, so that you can view bits of different pages with other bits, if you know what I mean.
There was a children's book I recall, Victorian possibly, <em>Heads Bodies and Legs</em> -- from which the surrealist game <em>The Exquisite Corpse</em> may have been derived.</div>
