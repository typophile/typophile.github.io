And of course I can't really know the answer: a system can never understand itself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think there are two levels of knowledge, conscious and subconscious, with the latter being more shallow and inconstant, but more forceful. The fact that I consciously know that Garamond is of French origin ruins any possible subconscious appreciation. Fortunately for laymen (readers) they don't know the background, so the type can have a deeper association with social/national/ethnic context. Do laymen associate Garamond with French culture?
