  body: "Since the mark is way more dynamic than the type, you could try something
    different: less boxy, maybe more condensed (since the name is pretty long). The
    byline\u2019s typeface, for example, looks more in line with the mark. \r\nIf
    the client will not budge, you could try to change the way the text is laid out
    (multiple lines, perhaps even tilted)."
