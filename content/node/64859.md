  tried opening font book today and i got a message saying:\r\nThe application font
  book quit unexpectedly, reopen?\r\nTried reopening , same thing happened. Is Font
  book corrupt? How do I fix this.\r\nAny help would be great."

    (hence my Googling \"Font Book Won't Open\" -- which is how I found you).\r\n\r\nI
    would have thought Font Book was a standalone app but this is a curious coincidence.\r\n\r\nI
    did try a restart but it didn't help.\r\n\r\nI hope you get a better response
    than mine."

  body: How funny. Yeah mine is still down. i did put odd fonts into the library about
    a week ago but i dont know if that could be the case. i have no idea how to start
    it running again without buying it again and dont know if the program would be
    on my mac restore disks. ugh. let me know if you hear anything if you can
