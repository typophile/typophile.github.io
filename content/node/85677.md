  bring it to General Discussion:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/80630\r\n\r\nIt's
  the typeface uniquely designed by Retype for the city of Bath. It was interesting
  to read one of the comments saying that it looks quite Dutch. I wonder if anyone
  else here has a shared opinion of this? As perhaps a novice, I can't seem to place
  why it would look Dutch. Then again the other interesting thing is that Retype are
  based in the Hague, so maybe there are influences of that?\r\n\r\nI welcome all
  types of discussion on this matter!"

    be more accurate to speak of a certain kind of Dutch type design, informed by
    the theories and teaching of Gerrit Noordzij (author of <em>The Stroke<em>).\r\n"

    Could you elaborate on that? i.e. do you think it's a particular quality that
    the Bath type family has that reminds you of Lucas de Groot, or is it just \"a
    feeling\"?"

  body: I wish I could explain it in a more technical or intellectual way but I can't.
    I guess in bold it just reminds me of Lucas de Groot's typefaces, especially 'the
    mix', 'the sans' and 'the serif'. I guess you could say it is just a feeling because
    when you look at them side by side they are clearly different.

    of \"Dutch\" typeface being referred to had, as one of its first representatives,
    the typeface Quay Sans, previously designed by the same British designer David
    Quay.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the discussion didn't really define what was being referred
    to, but it was noted that Dutch typography of late has included a lot of innovative
    and contemporary type designs."
