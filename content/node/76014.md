  eye for design.  My best friend does and I've noticed over the years that she has
  helped me \"develop\" my eye.  When I created a logo for my company (she was swamped
  at the time) and asked for her opinion, I thought she was going to reach through
  the phone and strangle me...I'd used what I now know is the much-typophile-hated
  font, Papyrus.  Anyway, I digress...\r\n\r\nI'm often trying to pair fonts, and
  I've learned a lot over the last year about fonts, but I'm still not confident about
  my pairing ability.  Can you guys offer me some rules or guidelines for choosing
  complementary fonts?  Most of the time I'm using them for print, although if there
  are different rules for the web (other than understanding what fonts will be picked
  up by browsers) I'd like to read your thoughts on that too.\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend
  is out of town at the moment, but I can tell you that I have many times put two
  together only to have her tell me I was totally wrong...still I don't think I'm
  hopeless.  Just slow to develop."

    categories.  Unfortunately, the only categories I really know are the broadest
    three: sans, serif and script (don't mean to insult or irritate anyone if I'm
    not correct).\r\n\r\nAlthough I'll never get caught using Papyrus again, for illustrative
    purposes would anyone be willing to explain to me the qualities you'd observe
    about the font in choosing a complement for it?  What questions about the known
    font should I ask myself in order to create a pair?  I can't even categorize a
    font like Papyrus so that means the only rule I know is ineffective to me in that
    instance.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone in advance for your thoughtful responses!!!"

    be no pointers anyone could offer seeming as how you don't have the \"eye\".\r\n\r\nIf
    you just want a basic understanding I would say it's simply a technical matter,
    and you don't need to invest tonnes of time to have a fundamental understanding
    of how different types contrast. The two most helpful starting books for me were
    <em>Design With Type</em> by Carl Dair and <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em>
    by Robert Bringhurst. Either is a great read and good to have around as a reference
    if you plan to do work with type."

  body: "This [[http://www.typography.com/email/2010_03/index.htm|newsletter]] from
    Hoefler & Frere-Jones (prominent type designers) does a nice job of explaining
    some combinations for (their) typefaces.\r\n\r\nThis [[http://www.typophile.com/node/32056|listing]]
    shows various Typophile posts on pairing fonts.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean exactly
    about not mixing categories? Surely, using a sans font for display/larger text
    and a serif for text/smaller text is a fairly traditional method of pairing.\r\n\r\nThe
    qualities to observe can vary. For example, say you want to use Helvetica. Simply
    relying on boldness/weight to provide contrast can allow you to use a regular
    version and a bold version of the same typeface. They complement each other because
    they share the same shapes/forms/style but differ in the thickness/weight.\r\n\r\nOn
    the topic of Papyrus, I would classify it as a distressed (roughened/textured)
    script. Something can be a script without looking like cursive; Papyrus is closer
    to calligraphy. You needn't swear off Papyrus forever, because I'm guessing you
    don't have any other fonts like it (if interested, [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/papyrus/|this]]
    is a helpful list). Just know that Papyrus is very widespread in its use. Many
    designers consider it amateurish due to its misuse and overuse.\r\n\r\nIf you
    truly want to develop a greater sense for these things, I encourage you to read
    Typophile regularly. I have found it invaluable. Also, experiment and practice
    can only help.\r\n\r\nApologies for the long response."

  body: "My understanding is that one rule of thumb is not to combine two faces in
    the <em>same</em> category.\r\n\r\nThus, mixing Franklin Gothic and Times Roman
    is not so bad, because there is a strong contrast between them, one a bold sans-serif,
    and one a normal serif, but mixing faces that are similar (yet definitely different,
    and thus not matching), such as Caslon and Times Roman is what one isn't supposed
    to do.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly sure that this has been given as a rule of thumb to beginning
    typographers in a number of textbooks on the subject."

    that discussion to [[Typeface Pairing]] which gave a link to\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/45613]]\r\n\r\nwhich
    shows that I was not imagining things when I said that a strong contrast is the
    \"safe, boring\" recommendation.\r\n\r\nHowever, you don't need to use a sans-serif
    for titles if you are intending to use a different face from the serif type used
    for body copy. An Egyptian will do. A Clarendon will do. Even the contrast between
    Bodoni for headings and a serif Roman which is not a modern will do. (Although,
    to be safe, one likely will use a bold weight for the headings for a little extra
    contrast.)\r\n\r\nHowever, while contrast is good, another one of the safe rules
    of thumb, I saw from that thread, is not to combine two faces with a strong personality.
    So one doesn't use two display faces at once. No mixing Papyrus with Hobo, or
    Cooper Black with Comic Sans, or even Amelia with Albertus."
