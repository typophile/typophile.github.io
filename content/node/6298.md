  body: It&#39;s very similar to a film type called Benguiat Charisma, which was once
    included in the Expresiv Photolettering Font Collection put out by Tiger Direct
    in the mid-90&#39;s. <BR> <BR>The intial letters are a lot like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/candice/"
    target="_blank">E&#43;F Candice</a>, but Charisma&#39;s lower case is more like
    this sample.  I may have a sample of Charisma in my Script Guide, and I will post
    it if I do.

  body: Mike, I think this is Gaston, you can check it in the Solotype Catalog &#40;p.
    101&#41; and it is in the <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/doverpublications/0486999769.html"

  body: You&#39;re absolutely right, about the font and the Dover CD. It&#39;s shown
    in full in the &#39;Bold Script Alphabets&#39; book by Dover too. I just didn&#39;t
    look far enough. I knew it wasn&#39;t a match, but I saw it was close, and thought
    it might be close enough.  <BR> <BR>Good catch Ignacio!
