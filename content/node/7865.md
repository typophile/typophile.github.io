  body: Kenn, it has been built and opens today. The image is a press one, and so
    is primped somewhat! <BR> <BR>John, I think it was very brave of them to try this,
    and using Romano-Celtic lettering on such a monumental and central scale on a
    building who&#39;s focus is the literary tradition of Wales seems fitting and
    amusing - at least, to me. I&#39;m not sure I see it as aping any more than modern-day
    typographers &#34;ape&#34; any of those in the past. Whether it is the world&#39;s
    best example typographically speaking is of course debatable - for example, some
    of the spacing has been compromised in order to maintain structural integrity
    of the building. <BR> <BR>Then again, you know an awful awful lot more about type
    than I <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    of the building, which is massive and, from the pictures I&#39;ve seen so far,
    overbearing in a very literal way. These are letterforms that belong at a smaller
    scale: they are intimate, not monumental. This is why I think it looks like a
    pastiche &#40;and very much a pastiche of David Jones&#39; quite personal lettering,
    rather than a new interpretation of his historical inspiration&#41;. So to me
    it looks like something that has been done by someone who doesn&#39;t really understand
    what is in his hands. And this is confirmed by their website, because on <a href="http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?method=building.inscription">this
    page</a> there is an image that is captioned <i>Romano Celtic Heritage</i>. This
    is a detail of David Jones&#39; inscription that begins &#39;Cara Wallia derelicta...&#39;
    &#40;a poster of which is sitting about two metres to my right as I type this&#41;,
    made in London c.1959. Many of the letterforms on the new building appear to have
    been copied directly from this inscription. The original, by the way, is in black
    and green, not the red seen on the website. <BR> <BR>You&#39;d think they would
    at least credit him -- a major Welsh artist --, rather than trying to pass of
    his unique work as some kind of generic ancient heritage.'

    day time photo of the signage very exciting and appropriate. The letter forms
    give the appearance of being incised or debossed. The whole canopy/roof structure
    has the feeling of a massive cliff with incised lettering.The signage blends in
    with the background material therefore the copy can be used in monumental size
    with out being overbearing. <BR>Hopefully we can get better daytime close up photos
    of the signage so we can see the details. <BR> <BR>The night photo of the signage
    fails miserably and is only a rendering so I would not put to much faith in the
    effect it creates. Hopefully they used as much sensitivity for the night time
    appearance as the daytime.  <BR>The use of white copy on a dark background with

    The original inscription is in black and olive-green opaque water-colour, underpainted
    with Chinese white. Jones also worked over the outlines and counters with white
    paint. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not being pedantic. Basically, I think the use of this
    lettering on this building is a lie, from the failure to credit Jones to the terrible
    misunderstanding -- betrayal is not too strong a word -- of his vision. It is
    a form of historical fa

    image <a href="http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?method=building.inscription">here</a>,  I
    can see a grid of fine lines through the lettering, and some distortions that
    suggest this is actually an application of Jones&#39; inscription in tile someplace.
    I wonder where? So I expect the colouring was done as part of this earlier architectural
    application, presumably because the red made for a more striking image, or perhaps
    it matched the carpet...

    seen this before &#40;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been in Swansea since I was about
    eight years old&#41;. This is a nice piece: the density of the text is similar
    to Jones&#39; work, but of course the lettering style is quite different and much
    more regularised: Jones never claimed to be a calligrapher, and considered his
    inscriptions as paintings not writings. What I particularly like about the Ieuan
    Rees carving is the white painted lettering, the blue of the slate, and the rise
    and fall of the lines of text: whitecap waves in Swansea Bay.'
