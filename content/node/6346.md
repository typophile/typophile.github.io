  body: Since my original <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33179.html"
    target="_blank">Shins</a> post, I&#39;ve found out that this typeface has been
    known many different names. Alphabets, Inc. called it Box Gothic, but it&#39;s
    also been known as Alwood Box Gothic, Jubilee Wood and Gothic Bold. I&#39;ve seen
    the Alphabets version &#40;with the cooler w&#41; as Box Gothic and Jubilee Wood.
    I suspect the Solotype version may be licensed from Alphabets with a different
    name since Alphabets was mentioned in the copyright but maybe some miscreant simply
    renamed it.

  body: too bad the woodtype site won&#39;t let you download... and they&#39;re all
    for mac. i think their version of  Antique Tuscan is the closest I&#39;ve seen
    to Beck&#39;s Odelay cover &#40;I searched for that one for a while so i thought
    i&#39;d throw it out there&#41;

  body: James, I&#39;m surprised at your statement about Solotype licensing something
    from Alphabets, Inc. Some of my old Photo-Lettering books show styles a lot like
    &#39;Box Gothic&#39; from long before A&#42;I digitized Box Gothic in 1990.  To
    me it seems more likely that A&#42;I digitized from an existing source, and Jubilee
    Wood &#40;the Solotype name&#41; may have been the original name of the wood type
    that pre-dates film type or digital fonts that copied the style.

  body: What threw me is that a while ago I came across a font called Jubilee Wood.
    In the copyright area it mentioned both Solotype and Alphabets Inc. It also had
    the alphabets W. Like I mentioned above, this may not have been an authorized
    version of Jubilee Wood and may simply have been A&#42;I&#39;s BoxGothic renamed.
    I do realize that these designs existed looong before digital.

  body: Paul, I do not unfortunately. I came across Jubilee Wood via a colleague and
    he doesn&#39;t know where he found it. You can still buy the Alphabets version
    <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=AI00003403P1&amp;start=1"
    target="_blank">here</a> but only part of their wood package. I hope this helps.
