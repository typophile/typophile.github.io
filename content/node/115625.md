    of Goa Arkitektkontor designed by Heydays. Better samples [[http://heydays.no/project/goa-arkitektkontor|here]].

    except for the \u2018R\u2019 in \u2018ARKITEKTKONTOR\u2019. They might have just
    modified it."

  body: Good call, R. And thanks too (for my knowledge). I checked only Founders Grotesk
    and haven't thought to National.

  body: Yes I'm gonna have to re-cast my vote to National (even with the alternate
    'g', Supria's lowercase is wrong for this in many other ways)
