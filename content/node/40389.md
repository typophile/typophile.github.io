body: "A punctuation mark and sometimes a diacritic mark, in Latin fonts and languages.
  In English it has two main functions: it marks omissions, and it assists in marking
  the possessives of all nouns and many pronouns.\r\n \r\nThe <strong>apostrophe</strong>
  differs from the closing single quotation mark, often rendered identically but serving
  a different purpose. In limited casesit is allowed to assist in marking plurals,
  but most authorities now disapprove of such usage.\r\n\r\nAccording to the OED,
  the word comes ultimately from Greek \u1F21 \u1F00\u03C0\u03CC\u03C3\u03C4\u03C1\u03BF\u03C6\u03BF\u03C2

  the (accent of \"turning away\", or elision), through Latin and French.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
