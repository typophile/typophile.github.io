  I love it.\r\nMy question is, does anyone know of a company that uses it? On products
  or on a website? Until I found it, I'd never seen anything like it.\r\n\r\n"

    and its website.\r\n\r\nI had a client mention it to me for a possible project,
    which really surprised me.\r\n\r\nBut I would expect it has seen a fair amount
    of use.\r\n\r\nJ"

    if you do a search for it here at Typophile you'll find some examples."
