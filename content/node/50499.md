  i might get lucky. Thanks for advance dudes and dudettes. :)

  body: This is hand drawn. The E in Head and E in Hunters are quite different. So
    are the two Cs in Hancock. Also the A in Head and A in Hancock. I can't think
    of anything similar. Searching for a word like "tribal" on myfonts might get you
    something. I don't know if dafont does a similar keyword search.

  body: I agree that this was probably hand drawn, but it seems to be modeled after
    an old face called Japanette, which you can find on some of the free font sites
    (I don't think there is a commercial version.)
