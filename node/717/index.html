  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Howdy. <BR> <BR>So I am really fed up with trying to proof my designs on an  <BR>inkjet. Anybody have any suggestions on a good laser that I  <BR>can get reliable prints from? I want to spend less than  <BR>$1000. I'd like to spend a lot less if that's possible. I'd  <BR>definately consider a used machine. <BR> <BR>Currently I'm going to Kinkos and chucking coins into the  <BR>machine (a Xerox 4050 or something - pretty good). <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You can't really use an inkjet to proof your type; the output is invariably heavier no matter how good the paper is. Even a laser can be quite unpredictable. You have to always keep the toner at a reasonable level, otherwise it is hard to have a consistent distribution of toner on the page. I have an HP LaserJet 6MP. It's 600 dpi and it served me well for seven years, but I could do with a better machine. You can pick up a 1200 x 1200 dpi HP for well under $1000 now, so don't go for a used one.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Beware laser printers that are not true PostScript. Most low-cost ones out there are PostScript emulators. When I was in the market for a new printer a couple of years ago, after the death of my beloved Personal NTR, I went through a hellish process of trying to find a reasonably priced laser with real PostScript. <BR> <BR>The problem is that most salespeople have absolutely no idea what the difference is, and some manufacturers are not totally up-front about the fact that theirs is an emulator. I bought a couple and then returned them, after discovering that the emulation was beyond awful. <BR> <BR>I finally ended up finding a used Apple 16/600 (which is very similar &ndash; if not identical, structurally &ndash; to an HP 5MP, I believe), and it creaks a little, but I'm plenty satisfied. I paid $225 for it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have a non-PS HP LaserJet 3200, a letter-size non-duplexing unit with fax and (sheetfed) scan capabilities, bought three years ago for $350 or so. There's an M version with Postscript as well, but I was too dumb to get it. Not big enough at this point, but the 1200dpi output is gorgeous and the toner cartridge has a fair capacity. <BR> <BR>About a week ago I bought a Lexmark C720 for a steal. The C means color. The color isn't too good, and there's only a black cartridge in it now (CMY will be an extra $600!) but it's PS so I can finally print from my Mac, hallelujah. <BR> <BR>The best PS printers these days are Xerox. Lexmark is also good. AVOID HP. They have gone WAY downhill&hellip; especially their PC printers, which install some crazy proprietary print driver that bypasses all of Windows' own print UI. Just give me pure, unfutzed-with Postscript 3, thank you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good point; the darkening is much more severe with small point sizes. <BR> <BR>I have attached two versions, one at actual size (at 72 dpi) and one close up. I think that they will give an idea of the difference. I had to get rid of the paper texture (the printed example was on very textured paper) but I tried to keep the type from bulging. I hope these examples appear. I have never posted to a forum before yesterday, and am a little new to this. <BR> <BR>The details (in my opinion) are captured well (except for very fine differences) however the feeling is generally darker. This can be a problem when you are dealing with the color of the text in comparison with other graphic elements, or very large type (which looks impecable) with small type. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/24603.jpg" alt="actual size -- 2400 dpi"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/24604.jpg" alt="actual size -- 1200 dpi"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/24605.jpg" alt="close up -- 2400 dpi"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/24606.jpg" alt="close up -- 1200 dpi"> <BR> <BR>However, despite these shortcomings, I am still very pleased with the printer. When we print out first pages for a book, it takes only 1 hour, with no printing errors (aside from our own). This is in comparison to the day and a half we used to have to set aside for printing on our ink jet&hellip; and I cringe to think of all of the streaked sheets&hellip; and the cost of ink! <BR> <BR>I hope all this helps, <BR>Robert <BR> <BR>P.S. I actually have been wondering about something related to this topic and I wonder if anyone has any thoughts&hellip;  <BR> <BR>Has the direct-to-plate technology changed the thickness and color of type (made it thicker)?  <BR> <BR>I have wondered about how the films (which are negatives) made type thinner, especially thin lines. However, direct-to-plate, which I think is more similar to a laser printer, dosen't go through the negative step, and may reseult in thicker type. Or type that is more like laser output.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My pleasure. It was interesting to see the difference. You're right, it is enormous. <BR> <BR>Yes, left/top are from actual printed examples. NB: I think I forgot to sharpen the 1200 dpi blown up version. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/24620.jpg" alt="blowup sharpened -- 1200 dpi"> <BR> <BR>I think that the point size is 9 pt, but it is Perpetua, which looks small. I would have to go look in the backups for the exact size. The first examples shows the images at the visual size. The blown-up versions are more for fun.  <BR> <BR>I've meet people who claim that 600 dpi is good enough&hellip; but I think that this examples disproves that theory. <BR> <BR>Also, I should mention that we've noticed that the thicker the paper used, the greater the difference. That is: Thicker paper = thicker type. <BR> <BR>Good day, <BR>Robert</div>
