body: "I don't know much about the use of conditions in creating a font. To try and
  get this to work I generated a glyph for the letter A and called it A.begin. I then
  changed the glyph and added this rule in the Open Type console:\r\n\r\nfeature diff
  {\r\n substitute period space A' by A.begin;\r\n} diff;\r\n\r\nBut it didn't work.\r\n\r\nI'm
  a programmer so I get logical conditions but I just can't find the documentation
  for this. Any pointers will be much appreciated."

    Here's what your code should be:\r\n\r\nfeature calt {\r\n    sub period space

  body: Thanks for that! Is there something to indicate the beginning of a paragraph?
    Because obviously there is no period space for those cases....

  body: It's not possible to test for things like paragraphs and sentences in OT feature
    code. You can only test for glyphs or runs of glyphs. This makes it possible to
    test for words because they usually only contain letters and are surrounded by
    non-letters. Paragraphs and sentences are not as clear cut, plus you can't test
    for return or line feeds.

  body: James, you must be thinking of Python. Indents don't matter in (AFDKO) feature
    syntax, except to make it easier to follow for humans. In fact, you can lay it
    out any way you like as long as you get your curly braces and semicolons in the
    right places.
