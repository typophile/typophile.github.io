  fonts</a> that were used in 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s on american cars, refridgerators
  and so on. \r\n\r\nIs \xBBStreamline Font\xAB a correct term to categorize such
  fonts, or are there any other better or \xBBoffical\xAB terms?\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s
  the origin of these kind of letterings? Where they \xBBinvented\xAB for car emblems
  or where there any other forerunners (like neon signs maybe)?\r\n\r\nAny information
  would be appreciated. I could\u2019nt find anything useful about this topic here
  in Europe.\r\n\r\nRalf Herrmann\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'd guess that they are just a reflection of the time period. Weren't they
    designed in-house at the car manufacturer's? If you look at the amazing shapes
    of the cars from that time period you can almost see the lettering in some instances.
    I don't know if there is a technical term, but there must be a car aficionado
    that can help you more, I'm just here to make sure the thread doesn't disappear.

    I would call them a form of upright script.\r\nExcept the ones that backslant.

  body: "This may just be where I grew up but in Pittsburgh during the 50s, we called
    car nameplates \"chrome script.\" An older guy from Detroit (even older than me)
    several years ago explained that the joined nature of the heavy script was just
    due to the technical manufacturing aspect. It was just one piece to cast and only
    needed 2 rivots to mount on the car. Today, they can do anything so there is no
    need for that style.  It is fun to look at though!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Ralf, you'll find more about this in the book called <a/href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Streamline-American-Deco-S-Heller/dp/0811806626\">'Streamline:
    American Art Deco'</a> by Steven Heller and Louise Fili. \r\n\r\nI think it says
    that 'streamline' referred to mid-century American Modernism and included architectural
    and product design. Chronicle Books may have incorporated it as a chapter into
    a newer book called Euro Deco, but I'm not sure. The original is out of print,
    but good reference. You're right about the relationship to neon signs; motel signs
    in particular.\r\n\r\nThen there is also\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontdiner.com\r\n\r\nhttp://www.misterretro.com\r\n\r\nand
