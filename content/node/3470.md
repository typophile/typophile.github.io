body: This is a pixel font I have been working for a few weeks. I am part of the class
  of the class from UW-Stout placing their specimens over in the Display forum. <BR>
  <BR>This typeface shows the truth of spoken word through voice stress recognition.  <BR>
  <BR>This is optimized for the screen because initially I wanted to use this as an
  option on a television that would listen to broadcast voices and determine the truth
  of the statements&#40;ie State of the Union Address&#41;. <BR> <BR>It is aesthetically
  influenced generally by Blackletter faces based on the decorative nature and its
  past use as the dominant typeface in one regime.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28009.jpg"

  body: 'Unless this will be set pretty large &#40;which seems unlikely if it&#39;s
    supposed to transcribe a full speech and stuff&#41;, it&#39;s too light: TV fonts
    need to have much more body, especially in the horizontal &#40;ie vertical stems&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>But the idea itself is pretty cool, and I like the blackletter basis
    too. <BR> <BR>One more thing: if you can make the two variants &#34;uniwidth&#34;
    &#40;where a given character has the same set-width in either font&#41;, that&#39;ll
    help you dynamically swap in one of the font styles for a single word or something
    without affecting the rest of the setting: less movement, more readability. <BR>

  body: I agree the face does not have body enough to be displayed on television.
    This is my first pixel font and i can&#39;t say it has been hard getting this
    going, but adequately building this with another pixel in terms of thickness is
    something I have not gotten to understand.  <BR> <BR>Actually the nature of the
    &#34;false&#34; set is to change the legibility, to make it difficult to read.  Lies
    are disguised and distorted versions of the truth. When I was building the alternate
    face I was trying to lose information and make it harder to read. It then turns
    out that the forms became related further to Blackletter and the underlying theme
    of Nazi &#34;truth&#34;. <BR> <BR>Yet, you do have a good point with the uniwidth.
    I don&#39;t know if it can be possible in contrast to my overall goal to show
    the lies in speech. I had an older version based off of Scala Sans where the forms
    were exploded, stems fell over, etc., but the overall width changed still. <BR>
    <BR>Maybe I could if they flatten out a little bit, with a little less pitch.
    I&#39;ll see if it is possible. <BR> <BR>thanks <BR> <BR>jp <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

    make us <i>more comfortable</i>! So maybe the honest font should be a bit harsh
    while the dishonest one should be all soft and flowery. <BR> <BR>BTW, be careful
    of associating blackletter with fascism - that itself perpetuates an untruth.

  body: Yeah I have thought of that also. Turning it around and making lies look pretty
    as seen in our current communications. I look at both perspectives and don&#39;t
    see one more favoring than the other in terms of approach. It seems that lies
    that are soft and flowery people would understand and similarily vice versa.  <BR>
    <BR>Upon further review I rescind my comment I made before about the use of blackletter
    type in Germany during WWII. My facts were not straight and for any inconveinences
    I apologize. I guess I should also round out my type history.  <BR> <BR>What about
    the type forms as a whole? I don&#39;t want to get some big head because the type
    guys at Typophile didn&#39;t give me any comments about the letter forms.  <BR>

  body: First thing is, have you ever seen a one pixel line in television? It doesnt
    work. &#40;period&#41;. the scaning makes it jump around like a crack whore. &#40;excuse
    the.. well&#41; <BR> <BR>A face that works well for screen &#40;TV is what I&#39;m
    talking here&#41; is one with some balls, one with open counters. It really needs
    to have a little substance to be halfway ledgible.

  body: 'Well I have gone back to the drawing board of sorts and tried to thicken

    font, otherwise it loses its meaning. Its like chocolate chip cookies without
    the chips.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28635.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>When I posted in the build forum about how to approach this I
    got a bunch of responses, but none that I could make any sense of. Sort of type
    geek talk with em units being thrown all around and debate between type designers,
    but not directed toward a &#34;beginning&#34; student in type design. <BR> <BR>So
    I have some questions: <BR> <BR>How does everyone else build their pixel type?
    Fontlab, Illustrator, other?  Can I build a pixel font in Illustrator? <BR> <BR>What
    should I be using if I don&#39;t have Fontlab available and only Fontographer?
    <BR> <BR>If I am building in a program like illustrator what is a general grid
    that I should set up to effectively make a readable pixel font? <BR> <BR>Other
    considerations I should take into mind? In simple terms if at all possible. <BR>
    <BR>And finally what is going on with this face. Ideas, critique, etc. <BR> <BR>jp

  body: 'Hey, pixelfonts are a hack, so it&#39;s technical! <BR>But your Fontographer
    is plenty. <BR> <BR>Visualize the font&#39;s vertical space &#40;&#34;EM&#34;&#41;
    spanning a number of pixels onscreen -depending on point size and dpi- and you
    can figure out how your font&#39;s &#34;space&#34; needs to be structured. <BR>
    <BR>For example a font with an EM of 1000 &#40;the norm&#41; set at 8 points at
    72 dpi will have a &#34;pixel block unit&#34; of 1000/8 = 125. In your case it
    looks like you have a vertical span of around 16 pixels&#42;. That doesn&#39;t
    divide into 1000 roundly. What you can do is either go up to 20 &#40;so have pixel
    blocks 50x50&#41;, or have some &#34;internal leading&#34;: like have blocks of
    60x60, which means you use 16 x 60 = 960 units of the EM for the letterforms,
    and that leaves 40&#42;&#42; units empty. Then when you go to use the font you
    use the point size you targeted &#40;like 20, or 16&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; I&#39;m
    counting top-to-bottom of the lc, which is the most useful measure. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;
    It&#39;s best to distribute this blank space more to the top than the bottom,
    like 30/10 in this case. <BR> <BR>There are also other issues though, like overlaps/touching
    between blocks, internal spaces coming out black instead of white, etc. <BR> <BR>As
    for the font itself, allow me to leave that to others - I have my own bitmaps
    to finish!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Yeah so I finally figured it out. One&#39;s self is always the best teacher.
    I actually used the 20 pixel measurement you quoted above. I built the initial
    face and it looks great&#40;clear and crisp&#41; at 20 pixels, points, whatever.  <BR>
    <BR>I hate math and wish to avoid aspects of it at all costs, but I got it and
    hopefull there will not be so many wasted entries next time.  I appreciate all
    your help Hrant and you other folks.  <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; I was looking at Cranbrook&#39;s
    2D department site and saw some pixel type inspiration along the lines of mine.
