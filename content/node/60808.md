    just rotating the Q.\r\n\r\nAlso why does N has that crossbar? Also you should
    lover N beneath baseline because it looks like it is over it.\r\n\r\nCould you
    post version without outline?"

    be smaller so that the end narrows instead of flaring out, though, so as to be
    less obtrusive when seen as part of \"N\"...?\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver
