    typography &#40;or may be a year, starting when i was studying the typographic
    elements of poems in my indonesian lecture class&#41;.I&#39;m very new to typography.
    <BR> <BR>And I think I&#39;m going to ask Mr. Hrant too, just like you Siti. <BR>
    <BR>So how do I have to start, Mr. Hrant ? <BR>There are few simple &#39;stencil
    lookalike&#39; A to Zs I had in mind &#40;i called it &#39;stencil lookalike&#39;
    because i don&#39;t know what typeface classification are they in&#41;and they&#39;re
    pretty easy to be drawn on paper using pen and ruler. But I&#39;m just not that
    patient when drawing them using curves on computer. I&#39;m very new to Fontographer
    &#40;4.1&#41; and need help to make my typefaces look pretty similar to each other,
    with the same basic identities or something like that. <BR> <BR>Thank you very
    much. I&#39;m really hoping of any of your reply.

    type design, or anything else for that matter. But it&#39;s generally safe to
    say that you should: think about what you&#39;re trying to achieve; dissect the
    work of others, with a critical eye, and never imitating; learn through doing;
    trust your instincts, but also be analytical enough so that you&#39;re not just
    making pretty paintings. <BR> <BR>Read, discuss, do, iteratively, until you get
    bored. Keep doubt and faith in balance. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I hope some others

  body: 'If you&#39;re sharp and dedicated, you might be able to produce something
    usable in 8 months. But that&#39;s using my definition of &#34;text face&#34;,
    which happens to be pretty tight. <BR> <BR>In terms of reading/perception, there
    really isn&#39;t any single book out there that directly addresses the things
    a type designer would need. In fact Herman Bouma himself never wrote a book at
    all - just a large number of interesting and relevant &#40;but also very technical&#41;
    research papers. So in order to extract useful conclusions about readability you
    have to spend many man-months reading and absorbing a large number of studies
    from the past 100 years and try to reconcile and assimilate all the different
    insights... Too much. <BR> <BR>Since this is just a start for you, instead of
    pushing the functionality boundaries you might try to stay within the conventional
    limits for now. You can easily do this by following the general design attributes
    of a really good font, depending on your application, like you could look at Unger&#39;s
    Swift if you want your font to be tuned for newspaper setting. But by &#34;general
    design attributes&#34; I don&#39;t mean details, I mean things like vertical proportions,
    color, width &#40;overall and letterwise divergence&#41;, letterspacing, etc.
    <BR> <BR>One other thing: look at the work and developmental path of Aaron Sittig:
    <BR><a href="http://www.xtypa.com/" target="_blank">http://www.xtypa.com/</a>
    <BR>There might be things you can fruitfully emulate there. <BR> <BR>Good luck,

  body: 'Jimmy and Siti: <BR> <BR>I agree that it is a tough project to attempt a
    text face under a short deadline. Usually a person&#39;s first design is a display
    face, and that is also not easy to do under a tight timeline. <BR> <BR>Are you
    required to submit a computer-ready typeface, or can you submit tight pencil drawings?
    If you need not do the digital work the task would be a little easier, but it
    is still a very difficult task. <BR> <BR>I also agree that the best way to decide
    a direction is to study the types that have been done over the past few hundred
    years to today, and absorb and learn. There is no better school than your own
    observations and developed taste. <BR> <BR>Whatever way you decide to tackle the
    project, I think there is no better way to get your head and hand into it, than
    that of drawing letters loosly with a flat graphite sketch pencil. Study a few
    old layout books of the sixties and seventies.  <BR> <BR>Adrian Wilson wrote a
    very good book on book design. The title escapes me at the moment, but there are
    some very good illustration of the terchniques of sketching type for layout. Anything
    by Alexander Lawson is also good.  <BR> <BR>Dover Books in the past ten years
    re-published Frederic Goudy&#39;s two treatises: The Alphabet, and Elements of
    Lettering under one binding. Goudy&#39;s Typologia is another good source. <BR>
    <BR>Read Alan Haley&#39;s Hot Designers Make Cool Types. <BR> <BR>Best of luck

  body: Hello I&#39;m 16 years old pupil from South Korea and I am new to this forum
    as well. <BR> <BR>My interests in typeface design kept growing since I graduated
    from primary school. <BR> <BR>Since I started enjoying generating visual images
    by computing my eager towards creation of typefaces has grown and when Sydney
    2000 took place I was so sure that learning to design typefaces is obviously important
    factor to realise my dream as a Visual Artist in the future. <BR> <BR>When sydney
    2000 was going on, I could see all the free and aboriginal, hopeful and traditional
    australian visual themes achieved by australian olympic visual makers but what
    fascinated me, most of all, was the type that were written in &#39;Share the Spirit&#39;
    with other official signatures during this olympic. <BR> <BR>I kept looking them
    got impressed by the slicker, elegant lines of the Semi-serif atmosphere, all
    the integrations with picturesqueness of the visual theme and extremely modern
    Semi-serif typeface - it was an idealistic coordination of conventional, craftsmen&#39;s
    ways and experimentalism. <BR> <BR>I was inspired a lot even though I was a naive
    novice kid in a sense of being a well-disciplined artist. &#40;there is no difference
    in presence as I couldn&#39;t improve myself under extremely irrational and dehumanised
    education system of south korea&#41; <BR> <BR>It took a year for me to find the
    name of that font which is &#39;Binary&#39; as I was looking around similar typefaces
    and I could also find out that it was originated from &#39;Rotis Semi Serif&#39;
    style by Otl Aicher. I suppose, in my opinion, Semi-serif aspect  in typeface
    design is an ideal module to combine both traditional and experimental new modern
    trials. It looks like symmetrised yet each serif is irregular, whenever I look
    at them I get some hopeful,  sense between static mood activeness. <BR> <BR>The
    time I spent at school under the restrictive pressure of the irrational education
    policy of south korean government kept me even further from collecting and researching
    things that had to do with my dream - typographic references, intepreted book,
    imported copies of books like &#39;The elements of typographic design&#39; etc.
    <BR> <BR>As even the environment for pupils to be educated in a peaceful mood
    at school are not provided, it is virtually impossible to get some good, specific
    written reference in a special, acrobatic field like typeface design, typography
    in south korea. <BR> <BR>Notwithstanding the suffocation, I didn&#39;t at least
    give up my interests in typeface design for example, even when I was having an
    apple pie in McDonalds, I was happy having discovered a special ratio of numbers,
    figures. &#40;I really liked this sensitive aspect of figure designs, I still
    have no clue of the origin of these, yet, I can at least make like these ratio.
    1,2,4,0 - normal 3,5,7,9 - down 6,8 - up. If you have any specific reference of
    this ratio in numbers please let me know&#41; <BR> <BR>Well I should give an end
    to this ideal talk &#40;I will disscuss about favourite fonts I liked each season
    later&#41; <BR> <BR>I am recently preoccupied by the visual designs and types
    designed by M/M PARIS group of which the artists achieved Bjork&#39;s current
    album artworks. It is the first time I get this mad and visually influenced by
    certain artworks of a group. <BR> <BR>Here are some examples of M/M Paris typefaces
    in Bjork Album artworks. <BR>http://unit.bjork.com/77island/77island/images/greatesthits26big.jpg

    <BR> <BR>Like other new comers up here, I have a struggling anxiety to learn to
    get used to converting the typographical blueprints on my head into real ones.
    I am improvising and practising a little in spite of lacking in references, but
    I think it is a time for me to take one step further to start theorically and
    conventionally train myself with type making. <BR> <BR>I will uploads few questions
    from now on. I would be very grateful if you could help and offer me some references
    I couldn&#39;t get offline in south korea. <BR> <BR>I am having hard time figuring
    how to set each side&#39;s angle THE SAME and accurately design on fontographer
    without tracing bitmap files and also wish to know the how traditional, conventional,
    normal process of developing typefaces is etc. These are my main curiousity. <BR>
    <BR>Oh and here are some of my improvisationsI know it is effortless and looks
    terrible compared to hard workers here. I just wish you to taste and let me know
    what is an ideal way corresponded to my typographical preference. Having only
    remoteness conception of the theory, improvising makes me worried. <BR> <BR>P.S.
    My english is terrible. Notice me when there are expressions that can hardly be
    understood. <BR> <BR>Examples of my improvisations <BR>http://hps.netian.com/funnybook.jpg

    that you have a great possibility to become a fine typographer, not dumb like
    me. The font used for The Best Of Bjork album is a beautiful piece of type-art,
    I&#39;m agree with you for that. And about the lack of typographic books to read,
    I have the same problems too here in Indonesia. I guess this  happens in every
    country in Asia &#40;except Japan and Singapore&#41; because of the local governments&#39;
    low concerns about the development of formal design education&#40;or stuffs like
    that&#41; compared to the other major educations. I hope you can reach what you&#39;re
    up to, good luck Kim, and wish me luck too. <BR> <BR>Now can ask all of you where

    it&#39;s a very promising avenue, and there&#39;s very little good work in that
    style. Most semi-serifs are either too calligraphic &#40;see Mayer&#39;s stuff&#41;,
    or too concerned with formal style. Besides Aicher, I would recommend following
    the work of another thinking type designer: Evert Bloemsma. <BR> <BR>As for your
