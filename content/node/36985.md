  work doing layout for a small town 'newspaper' (more of a newsletter really), and
  have recently seen the following course offered near-by:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.skillpath.com/seminfo.html/st/BROCH\r\n\r\nI'm
  interested in attending it with another of the girls from work as I haven't had
  much to do with design since a couple of basic courses in Uni years ago, and the
  other lady hasn't done anything at all. The boss agreed it would be good, but then
  the next boss up said that they didn't like SkillPath as the seminars are not hands-on
  enough. Personally I think a 2 day design course such as this one doesn't need to
  be 'hands-on' as such. It's more of a beginners course that should cover the basics
  and teach the theory behind design, rather than how to physically create design
  (which is what I think they mean by hands on).\r\n\r\nThe boss has asked me to put
  together a few reasons in dot-point as to why this course will be of value to myself
  and my work mate. The problem is that while I know a little about design I don't
  know enough to be able to convince someone who knows nothing that a knowledge of
  design is needed. I get the feeling that, like most people who are not familiar
  with design concepts and who have Publisher at home, they don't really see the value
  in knowledge about approriate techniques.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be great, I'm
  sorry for the long rambling explanation, I will try to keep any future posts short!\r\n"

    reminded of \"How to burn off 20 pounds of ugly fat in just 5 days.\" -- In other
    words, a waste of money.\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"tips the pros use\" is one tip-off.
    If it were a matter of \"tips,\" we'd all be pros. Rich, too. Or the repeated
    phrase \"keep your readers riveted to the page.\" You keep your readers riveted
    to the page by the copy, not the design. Design can help organize material for
    a clearer presentation, but as for riveting, no, you have to go to the shipyard.\r\n\r\nMore
    seriously, If your newspaper/newsletter company is a smallish company, I can well
    understand the boss not wanting to pay for such a course, hands-on or not. If
    you are going to be with the company a number of years, they might be willing
    to help defray the cost of some design education, but realistically, unless you
    are in the advertising department (and it is more of a newspaper than a newsletter),
    there isn't much in it for them.\r\n\r\nNone of which should stop you from learning,
    at first through books, and later, if the interest is there, through formal training
    if you want. Depends on what you want. I've always believed that school gets you
    your first job; how you do in that first job gets you your second job. But that's
    just jobs; education is a different matter. \r\n\r\nCharles Ellertson"

    you a better employee.\r\n\r\nA good 'design' seminar that you should drag your
    boss to is one of the Ed Tufte seminars that he does annually around the country.
    A really great 'aha!' one-day course for those in business that just haven't figure
    it out yet.\r\n\r\n"

  body: In other words in 6 hours you will be a productive graphic designer. I went
    to one of their seminars once. For the $200 I heard a lot of misinformation. The
    weakest part of the course is the typography information. Go to the library and
    read a few good books so that you can diferentiate between good and bad design.

  body: "Hi, thank you both for your comments.\r\n\r\nI looked up the Ed Tufte seminars,
    unfortunately though, I don't think the company would be keen to send me to the
    States for a course.\r\n\r\nThe company I work for is a big one and they don\u2019t
    have any issues with spending the money to send us on a course, they just don\u2019t
    think this one is any good. I agree with you Charles that it is a very commercial-looking
    course; however I think there might be some information worth listening to in
    there. I\u2019m going to be away from work for 5 weeks visiting America (so maybe
    I could catch an Ed Tufte course after all\u2026 ) and my work mate will be taking
    over doing the \u201CGibber\u201D. Here\u2019s a copy of the Gibber from last
    year, before I took over the job:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.woomera.com.au/community/gibber_gabber/2006/10_Nov_06.pdf\r\n\r\nMy
    friend was doing the Gibbers back then and she did a great job, especially since
    she had no formal training at any level, and I believe the lady filling in for
    me will be the same. You\u2019ll probably notice a few mistakes in there that
    are obvious if you know what you\u2019re looking for and it\u2019s those sort
    of things that I\u2019m hoping this course will help us with. As I said it\u2019s
    the basic stuff we\u2019re hoping to get from the course.\r\n\r\nWhich books would
    you recommend? I did a super basic desktop design course when I went to Uni in
    2002 I think, but it was a basic course, mandatory for all of the multi-media
    students (I was keen on computer animation back in those days) but I enjoyed it
    and I do love putting the Gibber together and find design interesting. \r\n\r\nIf
    your curious here is one of my most recent editions (still with a lot of the same
    basic flaws, but I think I\u2019ve been able to use some of what I remember from
    Uni to bring the look up a bit).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.woomera.com.au/community/gibber_gabber/2007/31_Aug_07.pdf\r\n\r\nAny
    and all advice on how to improve the Gibber are more than welcome too!\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\n\r\nAmber"

    starting with a couple of books and then do a course. That way you will know a
    bit more of what to look for/which sort of course would be best for you.\r\n\r\nYou
    should get Robert Bringhurst's book \"Elements of typographic styles\". Though
    no beginners book it is a great source for looking up information and by many
    considered somewhat of a bible for typography.\r\n\r\nOne book great to start
    with would be \"stop stealing sheep\" by Erik Spiekerman. It will get you started.\r\n"
