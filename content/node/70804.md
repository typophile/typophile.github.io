  body: "You're welcome.\r\nI remember the face because its designer, James Grieshaber,
    did a presentation about it at TypeCon a few years ago.\r\nthere is also a facsimile
    of the <em>Operina</em>, with translation into English rendered in a similar style:\r\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/HANDWRITING-CALLIGRAPHY-ARRIGHI-OPERINA-CHANCERY-HAND-/350350477029"

  body: It is a shame that James took this no further than a digital version of  Arrighi's
    wood cuts. Zapf overdid the formalization and cleanliness in Chancery and James
    lacked any sort of creativity or finesse. Not sure which is the better, but both
    fall short!

  body: p.s. this is what really gets my goat. James did nothing more than resurrect
    a 1524 copy book, La Operina, and, well do I have to say anything. So much for
    creativity. No accommodation even for the printing process. WTF

  body: "Given the amount of OpenType features and language support James put into
    the font, I don't think he can be criticized for building the typeface on the
    premise of a verbatim interpretation of the <em>Operina</em>.\r\n\r\nIt is after
    all the archetypal model of complex calligraphy rendered in print.\r\nIf one is
    going to address the issue of how to render complex calligraphy in a font, the
    <em>Operina</em> is a good benchmark.\r\n\r\nJames opted for rough rather than
    slick, on the premise that people find this \"charming\", and because, I would
    imagine, it is readily comparable with the original, so that the way the alternate
    glyphs and swashes are implemented is highlighted.\r\n\r\nEven so, despite this
    supposedly literal interpretation, he still had to decide on which particular
    instances of each character to base his digitization on--because the <em>Operina</em>
    is not made from type. So he also had to figure out how to make it fit as type.\r\n\r\nThere
    are many more considerations in making a calligraphic typeface than the degree
    of finish. \r\n\r\nIt's true that most calligraphy-mimicking fonts are either
    too slick or too rough, but that is because, as you are well aware, taking the
    middle course requires the utmost skill and concentration, and is a shit-load
    of work.\r\n\r\nMichael, which do you think are the most successful fonts that
    interpret calligraphy with creativity and finesse?\r\n\r\nOr are you imagining
    something between Olicana Rough and Olicana Smooth?\r\n"

  body: "Rough or smooth, Olicana came from an \"honest hand.\" They are both the
    same to me... just a different finish which supplies the designer with a wider
    palette since both could be used in different situations with forethought. Nick
    was thoughtful and did a good job.\r\n\r\nFiguring \"complex calligraphy\" in
    open type, in the case of Operina, is still using existing \"characters\" and
    just turns it into a simple exercise in digital work, where's the creative bent?\r\n\r\nIf
    one is going to ponder the dubious road of a calligraphic \"type\" then one has
    to consider (at least for me) something that is at least new, different, and (for
    me) less representational of copied/existing work. I am not a revivalist, don't
    care for it, and I will not serve up a design if I have nothing new to say. And
    my problem with Operina is that it just seems to be digitized representations
    of 500 year old letterpress forms cut in wood without any sort of finesse, well
    other than the fact that he can throw in all sorts of alternates via opentype.\r\n\r\nIt
    is probably indicative of my thoughts that I think SANS has been done to death.
    I see the little nuances in the new designs but that does not sway me that anything
    new is being done... it is a wasted effort by technicians. But that is me."
