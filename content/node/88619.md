  designer), I wanted to share some thoughts about libre/free fonts and the value
  of type design.\r\n\r\nThe rise of Google Web Fonts (GWF) leads indeed to think
  further the checks and balances between the freedom of tools and value of type design.\r\n\r\nI
  propose also a new licensing scheme and some pieces of advice about web fonts and
  web fonts service.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fadebiaye.com/read/blabla/typonomics.html\r\n\r\nAny
  comment welcome..."

    checks and balances between the freedom of tools and value of type design.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhy
    should Google Web Fonts have any impact on the way commercial type is licensed?
    Google Web Fonts is just another free fonts site riding a wave of publicity generated
    by hyping web fonts and open-source. Most of the collection is badly autotraced
    handwriting fonts or single weight text font revivals that nobody was clamoring
    for anyway. Eventually it will be like DaFont.com and every other free font web
    site\u2014popular with first year design students, and irrelevant to most professionals."

  body: "I wouldn't say that. Well, I agree with Dafont, but plenty of us 'pros' use
    Google Web Fonts. Granted, it's not necessarily because of stellar type selection
    but rather because it's Google, which is a reliable, known entity when it comes
    to hosting code for us. \r\n\r\nOf course, with the right clients, we'll all be
    using more of the commercially licensed faces now as well. It's just that Google
    and the like got a much larger head start so have made some ground there.\r\n\r\nAs
    for free fonts only being popular with first year design students, I think that
    was true a decade or so ago, when there really was a rather large gap between
    what was available as free licenses and what was commercial. But that gap, in
    many ways, has shrunk. There's a lot of really excellent faces out there being
    licensed in free formats. I wouldn't say that's necessarily REPLACING commercially
    licensed faces, but rather adding to the mix.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "James, I agree that in the graphic design world the set has had, and will
    have, little impact, but for in the software development space (apps and games)
    and web font space there's undoubtedly a measurable economic impact for vendors
    who operate in that area. Quality aside, at least from the legal angle, with Google
    standing behind them, these are a safer bet than most dafont free fonts. \r\n\r\nPS.
    Anyone know how close Google is to meeting their goal of 1000 fonts by 2012? They
    claim 393 families, but how many fonts? "

    sure. Poor quality quality quality quality quality.....\r\n\r\n\"Even more debilitating
    is the belief in \"quality.\" \"Quality\" in a product or service is not what
    the supplier puts in. It is what the customer gets out and is willing to pay for.
    A product is not \"quality\" because it is hard to make and costs a lot of money,
    as manufacturers typically believe. That is incompetence. Customers pay only for
    what is of use to them and gives them value. Nothing else constitutes \"quality.\"\r\n\r\nAnd
    a happy and prosperous New Year to all."

    maker, and certainly not directly from how much the thing costs!\r\nHowever there's
    always a layer of quality beyond what the consumer's\r\nconsciousness can appreciate
    - and critically some consumers know this.\r\nFor example in a text face there's
    the good spacing that leads to ease of\r\nreading - something virtually no consumer
    can really gauge on his own.\r\nSo how do consumers decide to spend more money
    on something than\r\nmakes sense based on the hard facts they know? Simply something
    at the\r\ncore of human behavior: faith. And I don't mean a gullible, blind faith,\r\nI
    mean a faith built up with experience in precedent, coupled to a belief\r\nthat
    people -especially those who put their hearts into making something-\r\nare essentially
    good, and they can't remain good at what they do without\r\nbeing rewarded.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    types for instance."
