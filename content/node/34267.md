  body: "You need to sort your glyphs. \r\n\r\nIf you look at your font (in FontLab)
    using the Index mode on the Font window, you will see the same glyph order that
    is shown in Adobe apps' Glyph window.\r\n\r\nWhat I usually do is switch to the
    Codepages mode and choose what I consider to be my default encoding (usually either
    MacOS Roman or Windows 1252 Latin 1). I first sort the glyphs by Unicode order
    (choose Glyph > Sort Glyphs > By Unicode), then I sort them by encoding (choose
    Glyph > Sort Glyphs > By Encoding). This leaves the glyphs in the following order:
    default encoding followed by the rest of the glyphs in order by Unicode.\r\n\r\nYou
    can also fine tune the order by switching to the Index mode and manually dragging
    glyphs around in the Font window to your preferred order."

    body: "Cheers Mark,\r\n\r\nThe font works fine it's just the glyph window were
      it's displayed differently. I've noticed it with a number of other fonts. \r\n\r\nOut
      of curiosity, will it cause problems if I don't do anything? \r\n\r\nI must
      admit this is the first time I've come across this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest
      wishes,\r\n\r\nDave\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Not sorting the glyphs doesn't cause any problems, unless you consider arbitrary
    order in Glyph palettes a problem. You will also see this arbitrary order in some
    font managers, such as Apple's Font Book.\r\n\r\nFWIW, the glyph order you are
    seeing has to do with the order in which you created the glyphs in FontLab, specifically
    when you go from a gray cell to a white cell by, for example, double-clicking
    on it. If you make a new version of a glyph and delete the original, the new glyph
    will fall at the end of the order. For this reason, I don't do any sorting until
    I am nearly finished with a font, otherwise you end up doing it over and over."
