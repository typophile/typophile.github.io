body: "I work for a magazine that prints a lot of programming code blocks in which
  we use only straight quotes. The problem is, InDesign is automatically changing
  all of our straight quotes into curly quotes because we need curly quotes in our
  general body text. I've discovered the Stylistic Sets option for Glyphs and have
  made a new set that has the curly quotes removed, but I don't know how to get our
  code Paragraph Style to use the Stylistic Set I created instead. Am I even attempting
  to do the right thing here? How would you go about getting a Paragraph Style using
  Letter Gothic to use only straight quotes?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help
  or suggestions!\r\n\r\n--af"

  body: "To prevent use of typographic quotes in any newly created documents:\r\n\r\n1.
    Open InDesign but do not open any documents.\r\n\r\n2. Go to Preferences, and
    turn off 'Use typographers quotes' option.\r\n\r\nThis will stop InDesign from
    converting straight quotes to curly quotes."

    which was not what Amy was after\u2014for her needs, Ralf\u2019s solution would
    work better, since it only affects the paragraph styles defined for the code text."

  body: "I have not tried this in the current version but I believe if you copy from
    a text editor and paste into InD just the code section of your text, it will not
    convert the straight quotes to curly. Copy-paste works differently than the place
    command.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
