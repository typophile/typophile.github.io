  body: The combination of this art with Oo-Boodlio-Doo would have a definite Ben
    Shahn vibe. Oo-Boodlio-Doo is inspired by Ad Lib, designed by Freeman Craw in
    1961, and it's hard to imagine Craw wasn't influenced by Ben Shahn's distinctive
    handlettering. [[http://americanculture.wustl.edu/dowd/f20_4354/fawcett/fawcett/Shahn_Chicago_Jazz_files/shapeimage_2.png|Here's
