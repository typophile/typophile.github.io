  wondering if one can buy it. (And I hope the answer is \"no\", or at least \"not
  digitally\".) It looks like this.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thomaslevine.com/Typography/businesscards/12846622_WUQFP#964011598_7kLsu-A-LB\"

  can I buy this? If so, where? And I wouldn't be surprised if it also goes by another
  name. Does it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is <a href='http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/index.htm' target='_blank'>Queen
    Empress</a> - Paul Lloyd's digital version of Motto (Morris Fuller Benton, 1915).
    Not a perfect version and it would be nice if Lloyd had bothered to credit the
    original."

  body: According to the text with the font file(s), PJL got it from a book named
    "King Emperor's Jubilee" that was published in 1935. Never seen the book, so no
    idea if it lists the type used.

  body: "Rereading what I wrote, I should have been clearer and less snarky.\r\n\r\nA
    matching font for the sample text would be Queen Empress, which was Paul Lloyd's
    digital version of Motto. And Mr. Lloyd often failed to credit the original or
    source."
