  body: "I don\u2019t think that there was standard for this, it\u2019s one of those
    things that was determined by manufacturers and would vary dramatically around
    the world based on the local language. Metal type was also sold by weight, and
    in the 1912 ATF catalog the scheme is broken down by the weight in pounds and
    ounces of each letter included in a 100 lb. font\u2014which suggest that the number
    of each sort would vary based on individual sort weights. "

    or Monotype houses. Unfortunately, I don't have any info on fonting schemes here
    at my office, so I'm no help.\r\n\r\nYou might check with some current Monotype
    shops that still sell fonts. M&H Type in San Francisco or Quaker City Type Foundry
    in Honey Brook, Pennsylvania. Or Sterling Type in Indiana. Or Bell Type & Rule
    in Los Angeles. Or Hill & Dale Foundry in West Virginia.\r\n\r\nSome Monotype
    houses would also make custom fonting schemes. Or sell 6-inch lines of individual
    sorts. Depending on what a printer needed.\r\n\r\nFoundries and Monotype houses
    also sold \"weight fonts,\" extensions of the standard fonting schemes in larger
    quantities.\r\n\r\nLet us know what you find out.\r\n\r\npowers"

    Carter gives a scheme for English for 500 lbs. Roman (12-pt. Old Style). I'm not
    inclined to try to transcribe it here. But maybe later I can scan the charts and

  body: "Here is Harry Carter's scheme from <cite>Fournier on Typefounding</cite>,
    his translation of Fournier's <cite>Manuel Typographique</cite>, Volume 3, pp.
    236&#150;37 (originally published in 1930; my source is the 1995 Darmstadt facsimile).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HCarterFournier_p236-37_5442.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNote
    that this has no real correspondence to Fournier's scheme, which was for French
    and for 100,000 letters [<em>\"Police de cents milliers de lettres\"</em>], and
    not by weight as was the later practice. I assume Carter's scheme is based on
    some 1930s standard.\r\n\r\nJames Mosley wrote the introduction and notes for
    my edition. Perhaps he will wander by here and offer some additional insight on
    traditional font schemes."
