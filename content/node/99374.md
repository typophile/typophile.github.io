  de Groot\r\nGerard Unger\r\nLeslie Cabarga\r\nTobias Frere-Jones\r\nRobert Slimbach\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nI
  would love to learn more, and I feel I have overlooked many vector drawing heros.\r\n\r\nIf
  you could nominate five people to the <strong>Bezier Drawing Hall of Fame</strong>,
  who would you choose?\r\n"

  body: "Dang! Three points to Nick Shinn!\r\n\r\nThanks for all the great suggestions.
    By calling this the \"Bezier Hall of Fame\" the thought was to call attention
    to typographers with a strong command of vector drawing, or who use beziers in
    innovative ways. For example, I had somewhat admired the printed forms of Garage
    Gothic since the 1990's, but when I finally took a look at Frere-Jones' vectors
    I was blown away, impossible! was my first reaction. Just seeing those vectors
    created a sense of fresh possibilities for me.\r\n\r\nThere are typographers who
    keep vector shapes \"extremely\" simple, so as to make later adjustments easy
    and flexible. Still others employ secret \"trappy\" tricks to get gaps to behave.
    Its possible to be too myopic with technique and have the final forms suffer,
    but knowledge of the bezier possibilities is a great toolkit to have in your pocket."

    of outline definition as long as possible, also allowing outline overlaps in source
    data. As you say, this enables flexibility and ease of editing. My preference
    is to do this even through interpolation sources if these are to be used. <em>Then</em>
    I create a separate copy of the source file in which I go through the glyphs removing
    overlaps and adding 'trappy tricks' and other refinements to produce the final
    design. Of course, the only reason I can do it this way is that, after many years,
    I have a pretty good idea what refinements are going to be necessary and what
    affect they will have, meaning that I don't need them for early testing of letter
    shapes because I can mentally apply them."
