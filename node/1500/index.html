		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. So what do Windows users use their left hand for? ;-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seriously, I've got a three-button mouse (with scroll wheel) on my Mac. The scroll wheel is the thing I most appreciate. I can never remember what the middle button is programmed to do, and it takes relatively difficult contortions to press it anyway (probably a connection there). The right button is nice, but control-click is just as easy. Sometimes I accidentally hit the left button while holding down the right button, a mistake that can't happen with a one-button mouse. In general, I find the multi-button mouse a bit less comfortable to use since you have to hold it with the thumb and two fingers instead of the thumb and three fingers, and the remaining two fingers must be more precisely placed. But I'm totally hooked on that scroll wheel. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The idea that a one-button mouse is for those with half a brain is ridiculous. If anything, it would engage both right and left sides of the brain more fully, since you need both hands for certain mouse operations. I'm not saying it's necessarilly better, but it's not necessarilly worse, either. Just different approaches with advantages and disadvantages on both sides.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">AT this time, I feel OSX and XP are both pretty ugly. I have switched from Mac to PC when Apple was still Steve-Job-less and never looked back, but the new OSX-Look would have driven me away for sure. And even on XP, you can't really like the look unless you switch off a lot of effects, hack the bootscreen, change the icons, the colours and basically make th system look the way you want it. On Win2000 I used WinBlinds to customize the look, on XP I just hacked it a bit and that is quite enough. The simpler the better. I argue that an Operating System for professionals (not the Home-versions, mind) should be as lean and efficient and most of all customizable as possible. XP and OSX are overloaded.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant &ndash; the logi Mouses do work on Mac. The MX 700 is the best mouse available at the moment. While the one-button-g4-Mouse looks great, it just isn't any good at all, except maybe writing letters. The only worse mouse was that awful idiotic  round iMac Mouse :-D.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow. In a case like that, a horizontal scroll wheel wouldn't be much use to me anyway. With unusually long (or wide) pages, I tend to use the keyboard for scrolling (option+arrow keys to jump a screenful at a time). I find the scroll wheel works best for smaller, less continuous amounts. For going through pages and pages of stuff, it gets rather inefficient.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One thing you may have noticed on that MacObserver page is that not all Mac users are happy with the one-button mouse.
