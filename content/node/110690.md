  body: "Not certain if this is the result of a designer carried away with swashes,
    \ or a similarly creative font-maker The S swash looks good on the S, but when
    it is added as a flourish to w, h and d, it looks really awkward when used together
    in the same word. For an S with this swash see Mark Simonson's Bookmania http://www.identifont.com/show?2I31
