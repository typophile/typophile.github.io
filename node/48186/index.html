<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi all you type experts
Is there a new(ish) font called Legenden? A beautiful, slightly condensed modern serif text face, makes a first appearance – at least to me – in beautiful new book
'Buch gestaltung in St.Gallen'
by Roland Fruh
pub. VGS, 2008
ISBN 978-3-7291-1116-7.
Can anyone help?
BTW, the other font used is Futura, also beautiful, but that I know!
Thanks.
Honestly...</div>

Or if you can translate this site you could e-mail and get info:

<div class=commentbody>Michael, just a side note:
[[Robin Kinross]] is a British gentleman, <a href=http://www.115.org.uk/occupant/robinkinross.html>see here</a>. ;-)
Peter, the author’s name is Roland Fr<strong>ü</strong>h (may help with searching?)
‘Legenden’ means captions, underlines, legends. Could it be that this is not the name of the typeface, but rather an annotation that the captions are set in some typeface? (Of course it could be a typeface, too, but ‘Legenden’ would be a very generic name, like ‘Headlines’)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Michael, I didn’t want to be a wisenheimer. Glad to see that native speakers can get confused by ambiguous English forenames like Jude, Frances or Leslie, too!
The website is by the municipality of St. Gallen/Switzerland. It announced an exhibition that presents 60 years of book design in St. Gallen. The show has been conceived by the world-renowned Swiss typographer and book designer [[Jost Hochuli]]. Roland Früh is a Zurich based art historian. He did the accompanying brochure (which is the printed matter in question). No infomation about typefaces, alas.

<div class=commentbody>Had this problem yesterday. Wrote a lengthy e-mail to a client. It was going to the type director...addressed the e-mail to MR., when I got on the phone with "Carter" she quickly informed me that she was a she! Been married for 26 years but I never confuse my wife with a George.
Bad day for me!

<div class=commentbody>Hello,
Roland is currently working with Robin in a building I share but neither of them currently contactable hence my (first ever) approach to Typophile.
Anyway, through a little detective work I worked it all out. The font is called Collis and is designed by Christoph Noordzij, available form the Enschedé Foundry. Check http://www.teff.nl/fonts/collis/collis.html for more details – and the pictures I couldn't provide!
Thanks again.

<div class=commentbody>That was one of the few times we said so much with no image to look at.
I am glad you solved your puzzle, but you might have done this on your own more quickly with the [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php|Serif Font ID Guide]], as long as you had sample of the type you could look at. Collis was in there, along with about 1600 other serif type families.
I know this seems like some sort of shameless self-promotion, but I get nothing if people use my Guides. I just think this one in particular is a helpful tool, which works pretty well once you learn how to select the attributes. It's what I use for the serif questions.

I second that.
Peter, congratulations on your find. So, still curious: where did ‘Legenden’ come from?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Again, thanks for all the help — I'll have a look at the 'Serif Font ID Guide'.
Okay, the red herring of 'Legenden' comes from my less than complete grasp of German. On the colophon of the book (see initial posting) it said 'Text der Legenden, Auwahl der Abbildungen...' I was grasping at straws but could just about decipher that the rest was about the printer, the papers used, etc. As it turns out, and rather uncharacteristically for a book with Hochuli's involvement, the typeface is not mentioned.</div>
