  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm happy to see that Spiece Graphics has its typeface Nicolas Jenson SG available.

In my opinion - and is this perhaps just me, or is there some validity - nearly all the "Jenson" typefaces seemed to me to be typefaces very distinct from Jenson's original typeface; whether those named "Jenson", or Centaur, Cloister Old Style, Jenson Old Style, and so on. Even though they were all good typefaces, they belonged in the larger category of Italian Old Styles - none seemed to me to really be a "revival" of Jenson, if one applied the same standard to them as one would to a revival of Garamond, Baskerville, or Caslon.

The only one that seemed to me to be a version - yes, "trued up", but otherwise it wouldn't have been usable - of Jenson's actual original typeface was Eusebius, by Robert H. Middleton and Ernst Detterer for Ludlow.</div>

Because I'm using a GoldenType-inspired typeface for stuff, but I'm concerned that it may not work well in certain situations. Some of its... personality... may be overstated, and it's x-height is ...unfashionable.

Quirks that your Goodchild... "corrects."

I still like a curly-tailed /y/, though. Even if it's "inauthentic." I'll look to see if your typeface has alternate characters.</div>

Looking at it, though, I didn't get a Jenson "feel", but I may not have looked carefully enough. It looked like Palatino Book (oops, sorry, Aldus) if anything at first glance. With a Times or Corona level x-height, though, it's hard for a layman like myself to see the essence beneath the surface.</div>

Goodchild was conceived as a news face, and has been used by Tony Sutton on a number of occasions.
Here it is compared with the original. 
I opened the counters up, as news text is much smaller than Jenson’s type.

Bear in mind that there is some variance in Jenson’s glyphs as printed.</div>

I don't think that happens.
Look at the Houston Chronicle face, a Venetian: http://www.christianschwartz.com/houston.shtml
It might seem like a caricature, but at small sizes and lo-fi conditions it really clicks.

The additional information on that page was interesting. So this all came about as an accident - the face wasn't initially requested, but it was made due to a mix-up, and it turned out to work better than any of the ordinary faces!

And Jenson Oldstyle, even if it owes more to Morris than Jenson, is a nice face for headings and headlines.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As I argued [[http://ilovetypography.com/2010/07/26/reviving-caslon-the-snare-of-authenticity/|here]], I think the pursuit of 'authenticity' is a snare. You can try to capture features of any of the old types, but trying to mimic the look you end up with a type that is only of antiquarian interest. Jenson is one of the greatest types, and people keep trying to capture its magic in different ways and with varying success. 

My own view is that they need to be evaluated each on their own merits, whether it's Centaur, Goodchild, Adobe Jenson, Eusebius, or whatever. </div>

<cite>I'm not sure what's your definition of a "true" revival – one that's adapted to current standards, usability requirements or one that's as close to the original as possible?</cite>

Both!

One that's adapted to current standards enough to be usable - but which is very close to the original in all respects not constrained by that, so that it keeps the feel of the original!

Of course, that isn't quite clear enough yet. Doesn't Cloister Oldstyle capture the "feel" of Jenson's typeface?

So perhaps what I'm praising is what others would esteem less. To be a revival of a previous typeface, and not simply a new typeface taking inspiration from that typeface, instead of striving for an original creation, after doing what is necessary to avoid the type being unfit for its intended purpose, the type designer needs to be imitative rather than creative.

Art will still be present, as there's no mechanical way to "true up" an incunabular typeface, but we move on the spectrum towards craftsmanship and away from fine art.

Oh, and to avoid confusion: among modern digital faces, what I'm thinking of is Nicolas Jenson SG, <em>not</em> Jenson Eusebius.</div>

Though he was of course writing long before some of the other modern 'revivals' came into being... I do think you'd be hard pressed to find a more strictly faithful recreation than Eusebius.

I'd venture to suggest that the Doves Press Roman might have earned a similar distinction... if it had survived, at least. :(</div>
