body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nFirst of all my english is very bad, so I'll do my best (I'm
  french...)\r\n\r\nSo what's the problem?\r\n\r\nI have created a font on FontForge
  on a PC with Ubuntu, following all the instruction carefully. \r\nI had a previous
  version of this font generated by FontForge wich work fine on Ubuntu and Windows,
  except some special glyph that I had not yet make.\r\n\r\nSo I've modified some
  glyphs and Generate it another time, but this work dosn't work !\r\nWhen I open
  the .OTG or .TTF with the windows font overview, their is no more infos about the
  font creator, copyright, etc... And no more font visible. Their is just the type
  name - Ammobox -, but no more.\r\n\r\nNotice that the font work perfectly on my
  ubuntu PC... \r\n\r\nHave you ever had this problem? "

    all temporary fonts files, but the problem persist.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the problem
    is created before, because it the same when I preview the font on the USB key."
