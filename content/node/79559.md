  body: "Hot damn, I'm so embarassed. That was the first font I ever made, using my
    personal writing. I find it poorly done, needing tons of adjustments. However,
    after it came out on DaFont, I've seen it in dozens of places, including this
    Kodak ad. I'm really glad that people liked it and are using it, but I'm still
    embarassed at how poorly done it looks.\r\n\r\nI don't know what's weirder to
    me: that Kodak is using it, or that John identified it :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks
    you guys. Maybe some day I'll find the time to tweak up this font and make a better
    version."
