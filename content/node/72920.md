body: "I'm having weird things happen with a font name.\r\n\r\nI've dabbled with Fontographer
  over the years to create some architectural fonts for my business (I'm an architect,
  if that's not obvious). I created a font \"ErickTheArchitect 9\" in Fontographer,
  and when it was ready to deploy I saved it as MikitenArch, to match my firm's web
  address. \r\n\r\nI've used the font for 2-3 years with no problems. All of a sudden
  a few months ago the font showed up missing in some software, getting something
  else substituted. In other places it reverted somehow back to \"ErickTheArchitect
  9\". In FontBook I've only got ErickTheArchitect 9. Other people in my office continue
  to use MikitenArch just fine. But I seem to be seeing more and more places where
  my computer won't accept it.\r\n\r\nI looked every place I can think of, but nowhere
  was there any ErickTheArchitect 9 name in my Fontographer file. I re-created the
  font from Fontographer anyway, but to no avail. I delete ETA9, add MikitenArch,
  it shows up in FontBook, but ultimately changes back again.\r\n\r\nNow I've got
  CAD software that's spitting out drawings with substituted fonts, and I've got to
  get to the bottom of it, so I'm looking for any suggestions."

    Could you clear your font cache?

    of my font names and they had all sorts of problems in various Mac apps.

  body: "Thanks for the comments. Maybe that was an initial error, having a numeral
    in the name. But Now I want to use the \"MikitenArch\" font only. \r\n\r\nNew
    Info: It turns out that my employees saw the font names change on their computers,
    too, but didn't mention it to me - a couple of months ago! They've all been using
    Erick The Architect 9.\r\n\r\nI cleared my font cache and the MikitenArch has
    stuck for three computer startups. But since they all had ETA9, I had one of them
    export it. Here's what happened:\r\n\r\n1. Export Folder named Erick the Architect
    9\r\n2. Font file named MikitenArch!\r\n3. Double-clicked to install, and it came
    up as Erick The Architect 9\r\n4. I clicked Install, and it installed as Erick
    The Architect 9, but both it and MikitenArch (still installed) show that there
    are duplicates installed!\r\n5. I disabled MikitenArch in FontBook, and Erick
    The Architect 9 shows up where it's supposed to in my CAD software.\r\n\r\nFor
    now this is working and I can output, but I need to understand what's going on
    here to avoid anomalies in the future.\r\n\r\nCould there be a Font ID I can save
    that's separate from the Font Name?\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions are welcome."

  body: "Did you make any substantial system upgrade a few months ago that might have
    precipitated the transformation? \r\n\r\nSounds like there are some font name
    id fields that obviously still have the working title in them. For some reason
    your systems started referencing one of those instead. \r\n\r\nThere are many
    more id fields in a font than older versions of Fontographer give you access to.
    (Don\u2019t know about the latest v5.) I don\u2019t recall how or if it populates
    them all upon generation. \r\n\r\nIs your font a TTF or PS T1 format?\r\n\r\nYou
    should probably find someone with a copy of FontLab who can crack open your font
    and rewrite all the font name id fields and regenerate for you. "

  body: The numeral thing is a big deal. I used to get similar bug reports and one
    day I realized that all the fonts with that problem had numerals in the name.
    No numerals allowed in font names.
