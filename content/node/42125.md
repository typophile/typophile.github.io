  body: 'Bifur was created by famous Art Deco designer A. M. Cassandre in 1929 for
    Deberny & Peignot. Cassandre was the pseudonym of Adolphe Mouron 1901-1968. Several
    versions have been created besides the P22 Bifur (which has a lowercase), Haroldsfonts
    has one with several color options. '

    than that at DaFont.
