body: "Dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a small, but fun rebranding
  project for a vintage shop. It's not exactly an antique shop, because they don't
  sell old furniture, but they do sell authentic vintage stuff like posters, accessories,
  music records,... Besides the shop itsself, they also have a huge collection of
  stuff they rent out for tv or film productions. Let's say you need a complete 50s
  candy store for your movie; they can help you out.\r\n\r\nThe company exists for
  25 years now and is called \"Habbekrats\" which means \"for a song\" in Dutch. This
  name was chosen because at the very beginning, they sold things at very low prices.
  Because this is not the case anymore, they wanted me to rebrand their shop.\r\n\r\nThe
  concept I came up with (and on which we already agree) is that it won't be called
  an antique shop, but a \"time travel agency\" (\"tijdreisbureau\" in Dutch), because
  they can take you to whatever era you want. The identity will logically follow from
  this concept, so the shop will refere to travel agencies.\r\n\r\nMy question to
  you guys is if you could take a look at the logo and give your opinion on it. I'm
  very interested in all possible opinions and remarks.\r\n\r\nA little explanation
  on the logo:\r\n- the bird refers to airline companys (travel)\r\n- the bird is
  built out of the pointers of a clock (time)\r\n- the bird flies to the left (past)
  \r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\nps: this is the first logo I'm designing for a client,
  so I hope I did not make too many beginner mistakes.\r\n"

  body: "re-branding is not just about a new logo, it's much, much more. re-branding
    comes from internal change, not slapping a new logo on the front and hoping for
    the best.\r\n\r\nthe concept is great (though IMO it needs to be more fun (based
    on the direction you've posted) \u2013 creating a sense of adventure and wonder
    \u2013 and more strongly reference retro).\r\n\r\nshow the concept more developed
    (how about airline ticket price cards, packaged promo kits like airline food.)\r\nor
    perhaps create several versions of the logo, as though it has changed over time
    and in different eras. making it tangible, tactile, playful...and you're on the
    way to a great identity.\r\n\r\nwhat a fantastic and fun opportunity.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for your comment, ratbaggy!\r\n\r\nThe logo I posted is indeed only
    a small piece of the puzzle. \r\nWhat I'm also working on are take-away postcards
    from different times, luggage labels in different styles which people get when
    they buy sth from a certain era (\"I've been to the 60s\"), the business cards
    will be luggage tags,...\r\n\r\nThis is my first \"re-branding\" project and I'm
    still figuring out what to do first (although I know you can't really plan that
    as ideas are constantly poppping up), so I started with the logo to have a good
    starting point for everything else.\r\n\r\nI like your suggestion of the changing
    logo.\r\nWhen I have some new stuff, I'll post them."

    the bird and the clock. The left = past I didn\u2019t get. The concept of time
    travel is a great idea. I second Ratbaggy\u2019s opinion."

  body: What typeface did you used for 'tijdreisbureau'? I like it. I also like your
    logo, but I think 'habbekrats' needs a different typeface. Also it seems to me
    that 'habbekrats' is the actual name of the company. In that case it should be
    bigger than 'tijdreisbureau'. If 'tijdreisbureau' is the company-name I don't
    see what 'habbekrats' is doing there. As a dutchman I know what it means, but
    I really can't see where you're going with it.

    the bird, i thouhgt it was a scissor or another tool. Maybe a backwards clock,
    with the seconds pointer going left, idk.\r\n \r\nawesome project & good concept
    thinking :) luck"
