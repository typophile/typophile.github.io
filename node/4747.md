body: Hello folks, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m stuck with this one - even the typesearch software
  can&#39;t pick it. Has some unusual characteristics so I guess it is not a &#39;mainstream&#39;
  font? It&#39;s from POL Oxygen magazine. Can anyone recognise it? <BR> <BR>Regards

  body: Yves, <BR>Yes, that&#39;s the one all right. You are a gem, a diamond geezer,
    a jolly good chap even! Your help is much appreciated as I would never have got
    that one. <BR> <BR>Best regards <BR>PAUL
