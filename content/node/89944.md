  body: 'I agree its similar, but Computer Modern wasn''t released until the 1980''s.
    This document was published in 1953. What about the sans-serif? '

  body: Computer Modern is based on Monotype Modern No 8, but much more lifeless and
    mechanical. The font used in that NASA document is clearly close to Monotype Modern
    No 8, but could also be another Monotype Modern variant (many of them were very
    close).
