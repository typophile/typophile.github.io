  recent Game of Thrones episode:\r\n\r\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6i6oGTFzUVE/UZBFQbkhKPI/AAAAAAAADG4/mjdGcb5qE2Q/s1600/From+the+Set+-+Talisa%27s+Letter.jpg\r\n\r\nSo
  I decided to make a font out of it:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cinga.ch/type/volantene.png\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to put it up on MyFonts as soon as possible...  probably I won't make it until
  the next episode airs, but still. I figure I'll offer it for free, since it's really
  more of a fan service than anything serious. That will also free me from the obligation
  to fill in all the annoying symbols and special characters.  ;o) I've always wanted
  to release a font for free to attract some attention to my foundry, and this seems
  like a good PR opportunity.\r\n\r\nIf you see something that needs changing, do
  tell me, but make it quick.  I expect to submit it within a day. I know the {B}
  is out of character, I'll definitely change that."

    leaving a bad impression with a rush job is likely to backfire. Unless you clearly
    state that you didn't take it too seriously and your paid stuff is better-made.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "@Hrant: Are you assuming the font is badly made based on its short timescale,
    or are you seeing blatant shortcomings in the sample? In the latter case, if you'd
    list them here, I could do something about them and leave a better impression
    in the first place.  ;o)\r\n\r\nI'm toying with the idea of pricing the font at
    $5, and putting up a password-protected sale that gives you the font for free
    if you say \"hello\" in Valyrian (which, frankly, is just a google away). That
    way, the target audience (Game of Thrones fans) are not discouraged by a credit
    card hurdle, while I might still make some money off the font later when the sale
    is over.  ;o)  Do you think that's too complicated?\r\n\r\nThe base price of $5
    should also clearly state that this is not the same kind of product as my $25
    fonts.\r\n\r\nPS: I updated the link above. The new {B} is much nicer."

    design god. :-)  Even though you know I like your work.\r\n\r\nPlus you plan on
    releasing this today. Considering you've spent more time on your commercial releases
    (even though you <em>are</em> very fast) it just seems to make sense that this
    would probably be not as well-made, hence a poor reflection on what paying customers
    get. What I'm getting at is that even a free font shouldn't be too rushed.\r\n\r\nFree-versus-minimal_price:
    I used to think charging a nominal amount makes sense, but then I realized it's
    counter to the purpose of maximum-exposure. As for a \"Game of Thrones\" mini-barrier,
    I think that makes sense for a free font, but for a paid one it does seem like
    too much.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The base price of $5 should also clearly state that
    this is not the same kind of product as my $25 fonts.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI think
    many people (in the realm of free/very_cheap fonts) don't pay that kind of attention.
    :-/  Just say it in the initial MyFonts description (which many free-font people
    won't even read though, but them you don't need to worry about impressing, since
    they very rarely buy anything - you just need them to expose your work through
    usage).\r\n\r\nAll that said, doing very steep introductory discounts does seem
    to be the go-to strategy on MyFonts:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/99369\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      quite sure I understand you right. Do you agree the mini-barrier is appropriate
      if the result is a free font (while is isn't free by default)?"

  body: "@ Craig: You're right about {I}. I had thinned it a bit already, but clearly
    not enough. I'm not sure what you mean by narrowing {T} at the bottom, but I made
    the whole letter narrower; does that address the issue? I also noticed {A N M}
    were too dark; fixed. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OITNAO_6650.png]\r\n\r\nAs
    for {X x}, I rather like them the way they are... sure, they're extra-special,
    but I tried more normal designs at first (including descenders on the lc), and
    they failed spectacularly. Maybe I just went at it the wrong way. Do you have
    an example of the shape you would suggest?\r\n\r\nThe font is 100% drawn on screen
    with Glyphs. I don't own a broad-nib pen.\r\n\r\n@ Hrant: I don't worry about
    zombies downloading my font; I rather worry about people wanting my font and ending
    up discouraged by the barrier. Something easy to know is just fine then."

  body: "Yes, I originally was going to suggest just narrowing the T entirely, but
    then I thought, based on the T in the first full line of the example photo, that
    the crossbar might be nice if it stayed wide and \"kerned\" over the ensuing letter.\r\nIt's
    obviously an entirely different style, but my [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/teeline/ambicase-fatface/regular/glyphs/506647/314|swash
    X from Ambicase Fatface]] might have been in the back of my head when suggesting
    an X with extenders."
