  body: If the curl isn't required, there are a fair number of serif fonts like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/astaire-pro/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D72%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DTOY%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D29|Astaire]]

    down the right side, like the one in the image. Huxley Vertical is closer to what
