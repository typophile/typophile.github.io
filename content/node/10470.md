body: Hi there...  I&#39;m pretty new to font creation / fontographer.  That being
  said I have a little question for all you old pros. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m having trouble
  having the inner cut-outs of certain letters &#40;R, g, P.  <BR> <BR>Everything
  looks like it should be working properly in fontographer as you can see in these
  following images <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif"
  alt="fontographer image 01"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif"
  alt="fontographer image 02"> <BR> <BR>But when I generate the font files some of
  those letters get all filled in.. as you can see in this screenshot from Fontbook
  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif" alt="fontbook

  finding much documentation online. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for the help!

  body: Tyler, a few things, first you images aren&#39;t showing it could be a number
    of reasons like CMYK instead of RGB &#40;have to be RGB&#41;, BMP files don&#39;t
    show up use Gif or Jpg. When you post on this site it will give you an error message.
    That is this sites way of saying your post went through. To test it go back one
    screen when you get an error message then scroll up to topics and go to design
    and you will see your name as the last person to post.

  body: I&#39;m guessing at direction of the beziers in Fontographer, there is an
    option to correct them. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have Fontographer at work so
    I can&#39;t give you details. Try posting the query in the Build section if this
    doesn&#39;t help.

  body: IIRC, you need to &#39;correct direction&#39; of the path. <BR> <BR>Also,
    as you&#39;ve probably discovered, ignore this forums routine page load errors.
