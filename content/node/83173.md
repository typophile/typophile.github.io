  body: "Your title says \"(not gothic)\", but in a facsimile of an old German type
    catalog from 1854 that I have this seems to be something they call \"Deutsch-Gothisch\".
    They are numbered, but the numbers seem to be differentiated by size, rather than
    style. As far as I can tell your sample seems like it fits this 'family', if that's
    the right term for it. The numbers go from 52-57, and from 60-66. The highest
    numbers in each range are the largest, but 52 is larger than 62 (but 60 is larger
    than 62). Obviously, I don't understand the scheme, as they are paired 50-series
    with a 60-series on the pages.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this seems to be the term for the
    style, and it appears different than \"Gothisch\", which is the next part of this
    book (numbered 42-50, with the type getting larger as the number increases). This
    type seems to have a greater x-height and have a darker look on the page -- not
    so much like your sample.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line on your quest is that you may
    be looking for a digital form of an old German typeface that might never have
    been digitized.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Ok, thank you for your help and a bit of an education on the topic.  I didn't
    know the term referred to a family of fonts rather than a specific font and apologize
    if it made searching more confusing. \r\n\r\nThank you again for delving into
    your personal library on my behalf.\r\n\r\n*cheers*  "
