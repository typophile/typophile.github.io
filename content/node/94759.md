body: I would have thought this would be as simple as entering a long string of text,
  but it seems oddly difficult to preview more than 1 line (vertical line) of text
  in the preview pane of Fontlab 5.  I can't find an option for this either.  Do I
  need to use line break "characters" some how?  Surely this is possible.
