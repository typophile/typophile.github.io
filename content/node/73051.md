body: "hi, I'm trying to find a similar font to the one attached...\r\n\r\nit's more
  sans serif looking than this and doesn't have a lot of 'air' in the letters  - very
  dense\r\n\r\nit has a very subtle antique/organic edge to the strokes and reminds
  me a little of germanic woodcut letters\r\n\r\ni think there's a couple of weights\r\n\r\nit's
  definitely not new, probably been around since the 70s\r\n\r\nany help appreciated!\r\n\r\n"
