body: "I've stumbled upon this hebrew type called \"Ktav\", which is now marketed
  via Palron & Fontype. it's not impressive untill you understand it's qualities -
  a good cursive hebrew font with interesting and unique ending letters, rounded structure,
  and a general graphic language of an ink-written hebrew cursive letters, probably
  inspired by an actual hebrew cursive sample. \r\n\r\ni searched for some info on
  the designer and found nothing. but i did found an early type sample from palestine
  (nowadays israel),1922, which featured this font in small sizes for letterpress.
  so this type was probably designed before 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_3424.jpg]"

  body: well, yea - the big descenders really create a problem, so this font mainly
    works as a one-liner headline. it's just not working in small sizes or a text
    block because larg leading is required to avoid collisions, so it seems too big.

  body: another interesting thing is that the final letters for mem and zadik are
    so elongated, that they are both descenders and ascenders, which creates a leading
    problem.

    long descender that reaches into the next line is of course a problem. But a letter
    that both descends and ascends? Lowercase \"j\" does that in English all the time,
    and no one seems to have noticed any problem...\r\n\r\nAh. Since we're dealing
    with Hebrew, ascenders of <em>any</em> kind are a problem, with or without accompanying
    descenders, because one is referring to ascenders above cap height, not ascenders
    above x-height, of which there isn't any."
