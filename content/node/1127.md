    one of Sauna indeed, Armin.  <BR>Makes me want to look into this and compare them.
    Good point.'

  body: I had the same reaction. When I first saw it, on a cross-country jetBlue flight
    &#40;you get to watch satellite television if you like&#41;, I saw a whole lot
    of the VH1 Classics channel &#40;unfortunately, they didn&#39;t have regular old
    VH1, and Classics is kind of a hodgepodge of stuff&#41;. My first thought was
    Oz Black, but later I saw Sauna and thought that maybe I had been wrong. But I&#39;m
    glad to have been vindicated!
