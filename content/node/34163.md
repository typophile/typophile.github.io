body: "For the past year I've created a 4 page report (front and back tabloid spread)
  in Illustrator CS2. I like Illustrator and have always felt more comfortable using
  it than InDesign. But more recently, I've come to appreciate some of the consistent
  features of InDesign, the ability to create specific styles for all the varying
  paragraphs in my reports. So, I'm converting my current template over to InDesign
  and have come across a feature snag.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Appearance_4889.gif]\r\n\r\nIn
  the above image, you'll notice the Appearance Palette in Illustrator CS2. I've created
  a triple filled stroke and want to do the same in InDesign. Currently I'd have to
  import the image from Illustrator. Is there a way to recreate the same style (possibly
  with Frame Styles) in InDesign so I can just click and apply? Is there a way to
  transfer styles from Illustrator to InDesign? "

  body: "OK, I'll bite:\r\n\r\n- To my knowledge, there's no way to import styles
    from AI to InD (or vice versa)\r\n\r\n- It would be easy to set up a frame style
    to apply a rule, but InD doesn't support multiple-color rules, at least not like
    the ones you're showing. You can control the gap color between multi-line rules,
    but not set different colors for each line."

    124 reads too much. \r\n\r\nI agree with Marc, can't be done, unless you put several
    frames on top of each other. \r\n\r\nI was at the Adobe CS3 seminar yesterday,
    and it seems that the filters and effects are much advanced in the ID CS3. They
    showed us how to make a 3D frame, amongst other things. I suppose one must upgrade
    eventually."

    I just started using ID CS2 regularly and now I have to upgrade to do what I'm
    able to do in AI CS2, and finally... this stinks. "

  body: "No, I don't think you'd need a 3D frame in your daily work , but there seems
    to be similar to PhotoShop effects pallette in the new InDesign with options to
    add effects to any part of the frame (text, fill, frame) unlike now, + other goodies
    like table styles, so it looked quite interesting. \r\n\r\nI just played with
    the frames a bit, and I really don't think there's an easy way out. You need minimum
    two frames on top of each other. Hopefully someone will prove me wrong!"

  body: Uh Oh, sounds like ID CS3 is turning into Quark 7 with all of it's Photoshopesqueness.
    Does it support HTML or CSS? I could probably build a 100 page website without
    breaking a sweat.

  body: I think Adobe has worked on the multi platform issues. One example was to
    publish a product catalogue on the net with pre-designed CSS to make it look nice
    with one click (it always looks so easy in the demos, doesn't it). I don't know
    enough of the web design to give you any reliable details about it.

    purposes -- that is, Adobe InDesign is for one- or multiple-page layout, while
    Adobe Illustrator is for vector-based illustration --; how could one be superior
    to the other?"

  body: "Well, in this context of page layout, I considered ID to be superior to AI,
    and the feature I'm trying to duplicate seems like a feature ID would naturally
    have. I was mistaken and thus, ID's superior page layout abilities are hindered
    by it's stroke style abilities. (well, I guess it's layout abilities aren't really
    hindered, but I'm feeling extra dramatic about the whole thing)\r\n\r\nI think
    I'm just more upset that instead of sharing features, I have to use multiple programs
    to achieve what I want. And I've been spoiled because I've been able to achieve
    a lot just using Illustrator for the longest time."

  body: I feel your pain. It does seem like a weird omission, but I don't have InDesign
    handy to check this out... At any rate, I'm sure that there's a workaround.

    can always create your own \"line\" style in InDesign -- look at the Help files
    -- and implement that.  The worst case scenario is that you create your line style
    in Illustrator, import it into InD as a library item, and call it up when you
    need to.\r\n\r\nAin't no big thing....  ;-)\r\n\r\nFWIW, if the only thing that
    is the sticking point is the line style, that, IMHO, is a small price to pay for
    all the things you can do with the text in InD that you can't in Illustrator."

  body: "I will agree, doing text in InDesign is definitely a lot easier and prettier
    than in AI. But most of the stuff I do, isn't very type heavy, so I haven't felt
    a need to use InDesign. I'm weening myself off AI for InDesign when I do have
    things that are text heavy even if it's a single page. I like the control I have
    over the text in ID. I guess I'm just having a struggle with the transition and
    I'm focusing all my energy on the limitations that I'm imposing. \r\n\r\nI am
    interested in this Library thing. Could you explain this more?"

    a boo in the Help menu, under Importing and Managing Graphics, then Using Object
    Libraries: that will walk you through the whole process.  ;-)\r\n\r\n(edit: you
    may have to create your line in Illustrator and place it into an InD file first,
    and then you can drag it into an Object Library, to resize as necessary.)\r\n"

  body: "<em>You can always create your own \u201Cline\u201D style in InDesign...</em>\r\n\r\nJust
    to add to that, if you choose a double or triple stroke from the Stroke palette,
    InDesign lets you assign a separate color to the gap(s) in between... But nope,
    it won't let you assign a different color to each line in the double or triple
    stroke. Sorry. You should write to Adobe about that; so far they have been very
    accomodating to longtime QuarkXPress users... I'm sure they'll accept suggestions
    from a longtime Illustrator user. :-)\r\n\r\nAlso, if you are familiar with QuarkXPress,
    I heartily recommend the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Moving-InDesign-About-QuarkXPress-PageMaker/dp/0321294114/ref=sr_1_3/104-1334615-7984767?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1180998672&sr=1-3\"><em>Moving
    to InDesign</em></a>. Very helpful."
