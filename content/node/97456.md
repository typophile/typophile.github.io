body: "Hi guys, \r\n\r\nI am in the process of making a new modern logo for an established
  civil engineer company based in Italy.\r\n\r\nI was looking forward in a simple
  yet effective and expandable only text logo.\r\n\r\nI loved the look of a sans serif
  font with a slight higher x-height than usual, something like the one on the attached
  image.\r\n\r\nhttp://postimage.org/image/jbti12w1n/\r\n\r\nI don't think that the
  font really is of good quality, so I would like to ask if you could suggest me a
  font with a similar style but more professional looking, so that I can work from
  there my logo ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your attention"

    towards a more geometrical and solid identity.\r\n\r\nThis is the concept, still
    have some experiments and research into it though ...\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://postimage.org/image/3x3m1nsj9/
    \r\n\r\n\r\nI would love to know what do you think , let me know.\r\n\r\n"

    an all caps gothamisch font does look a bit generic."
