  sometimes around London, including printed adds here. It is incredibly legible at
  small sizes, with its tiny ascenders and descenders. First thought it was HM Revenue
  & Customs Modena, but it's not... \r\n\r\nMight be an easy one, I must confess.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance..."

    But, the one in my flickr looks kinda different from <a href=http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/downloadFile?contentID=HMCE_PROD1_027379>Modena
    from HM Revenue & Customs</a>. Specially the 'a' and the 'y'. The ascenders and
    descenders are shorter than HM R&C type, too, which I'm starting to think is not
    called Modena, perhaps?

    weight of his Modena</a> on the critique board. Maybe if you give him some feedback
    there you can follow it with a question about your sample.

    from the three website lists the fonts as Modena-CondensedLight and Regular (and
    Verona). The HMRC fonts are listed as IRModena.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that the
    x-height is increased in the condensed, relative to the letter height, and that
    the descenders are brought up in pro."
