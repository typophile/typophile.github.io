body: "I have an art director who likes the look of this font. Can anyone match it
  or suggest something similar? Here is her description: \"what I loved about the
  mystery face is that it\u2019s relatively controlled and elegant, with just small
  flourishes to give movement and detail\". She said it was used by rinzen.com\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't think this is a font. If it is, it's very intelligent about contextual
    alternates and/or ligs. Those kinds of connections don't come easy. What you need
    is a lettering artist or a lot of time from a type designer. \r\n\r\nIf she can
    give up some of the custom connections she might like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/comicraft/matinee_idol_regular/\">Matinee
    Idol</a> or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/type_o_tones/memimas_family/\">MeMimas</a>."

  body: Oh, MeMimas is a good idea. We even have an alternate version that Type-O-Tones
    created with your (Font Shop's) help. Thanks for reminding me, Stewf!
