  but the \"ought\" is a sans-serif character. Go figure!\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would
  like a font that matches the old ATF foundry Garamond. However, if the font is cheap
  enough (free), I could live with many others.\r\n\r\nDo I need to have it created

  body: "The zero in Big Caslon is technically not \u201Csans serif;\u201D rather,
    it is the traditional oldstyle cipher style of zero, more or less authentic to
    the historical reference.\r\n\r\nWhat software and/or font formats are you using
    such that you need to use \u201Cglyphs\u201D (not sure what you\u2019re referring
    to here \u2014 do you mean the glyph palette in Adobe products?) to apply alternate
    oldstyle figures?\r\n\r\nThey should be easily applicable globally via the relevant
    OpenType feature in any OpenType font that has them and in any modern layout software.\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>
    > I need a Roman type for book work that has oldstyle figures as the default</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    have designed one; but it doesn\u2019t match old ATF Garamond, and I would hate
    to see it go for free.\r\n"

  body: "Kentiew: Thanks for the comments. I have since looked at EVERY serif font
    in the Font Book and now realize that \"ought/zero\" is based on the traditional
    typeface. I am still hoping to find a font with some more character than the Georgia
    suggested by riccard0. How do i get a look at your typeface and get a price?\r\n\r\nI
    am still open to suggestions."

  body: "Can I suggest my own Espinosa Nova? I don\u2018t think it matches ATF Garamond,
    but it has tabular oldstyle figures as the default AND the Regular is free, so
    you can see if that is what you are looking for before you buy any other weight.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/estudio-ch/espinosa-nova/\r\n\r\n[Note:
    the zero lacks contrast too. As I see it, this is a way of differencing \u201Czero\u201D
    and \u201Co\u201D, which is important at least in some contexts/languages.]"

    the thing with Big Caslon is that it is supposed to be used\u2026 well, at big
    sizes (thinner parts are really thin)."
