body: aye people, i was just wondering which chair you guys favor, the aeron chair
  by hm or the liberty by humanscale. the liberty seems to be less bulky and maybe
  lighter. my family runs an office furniture business so i will check more details
  tommorrow. any advice on the subject would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.

  body: The fabric on the Aeron tends to grind up clothing. It's like a microfine
    cheesegrater!. Long term users often find it coated with a fine lint dust, about
    the time they discover their jacket has become quite threadbare.
