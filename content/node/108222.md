    - Thank you so much for those images. If the first were shown on the Typophile
    critique forum, the font creator would be blasted for the uneven spacing and symmetry
    of the wavy accent lines. Anyone attempting to digitize the typeface would be
    faced with a decision about whether to retain or \"fix\" the quirks (I'd retain
    without a second thought). Also, according to Amy's Typophile thread link (thanks
    Amy!), those above-the-letters swashes were part of the typeface. Cool.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the second image ... cover of what? Amy's Typophile thread link initially gives
    a creation date for Mother Hubbard of 18880 -1895 and then narrows that down to
    1880 to \u2264 1892. Your Cover image would seem to narrow that further to 1880
    to 1886.\r\n\r\nOnly on Typophile, eh?"

  body: "Hi Mike, Mother Hubbard was a Lady Gaga of fonts in 1885-88. Popular & bizzare.
    \ \r\nPerhaps Mother Hubbard is the American adaptation of Zierschrift Monopol
    by Eduard Scholz of Vienna rather than vice-versa. Mother Hubbard has more alternates,
    which suggests an adaptation. There is no US design patent, at least that I that
    I can find. \r\nThe technology of the day included electrotyping, a convenient
    way to copy the physical shape of fonts made by other foundries. Font cloning
    and font piracy is a long standing practice in the industy.\r\nAs for the book
    cover, The book is \"Benton's Self Spacing Type\" Benton, Waldo and Company. https://archive.org/details/BentonWaldoSpecimenBooklet1886\r\nA
    typographical specimen book showing the unit-set types developed by Linn Boyd
    Benton under the trade name \"Self Spacing\" type. Date of 1886 is inferred from
    a letter slipped into it.\r\nDon"

    heed Mike's suggestion that it retain the quirks rather than fix them. Mother
    Hubbard is an excellent representative of the \"artistic printing\" movement of
    the 1880s and early 1890s. The wispy weight and variable structure expresses the
    feeling of an artistic movement that focused on world weariness, lassitute, and
    sensuality -- think Oscar Wilde -- rather than force and vigor. This is not a
    suitable font for creation by clipping together standardized components.\r\nDon"

    \"pretty\" enough to seem right for children's book advertisements. The dots and
    lines and the almost pennant-like serifs are the right amount of whimsical."
