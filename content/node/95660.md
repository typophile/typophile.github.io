  body: 'Image Club Graphics had what I thought was a decent version of this typeface
    (1992). It''s not available at FontShop, which carries some other ICG fonts, but
    it is available at some free font sites.  @Stephen:  Is this the one you described
    as a very bad freebie? It was $19 in ICG catalogs from the mid-90''s. '
