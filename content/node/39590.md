body: "I am redesigning the layout of documents for my company. I need advices from
  all you guys.\r\n\r\nThe most important is to decide which font to use for text,
  which should be paper-friendly and screen-friendly. We used to use Adobe Garamond,
  but it hurts to see it on screen.\r\n\r\nBeside text, I need some suggestions for
  headlines as well.\r\n\r\nI want the documents to be decent-looking, professional
  and with a designer's touch.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    are bundled and could work. \r\n\r\nAlso look at the Freight family."

  body: "What more can you tell us about the company?\r\n\r\nI have the same reaction
    to Lucida, and it is very neutral. The demi Bright can do a headline, and the
    fax version works on lower quality output."

  body: It's just a trailer parts company. Nothing fancy about it, but I am trying
    to do some branding about it. I like Lucida, especially "y".

    for--and odds are good you already have it, at least in some basic weights. Spring
    for Officina Display to go with it and you're home free...\r\n"
