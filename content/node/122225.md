  Studio 5 Mac \u2014Can't find trace tool, please help\r\nHello I am importing some
  character scans and I haven't been able to find the trace tool.\r\nThe 900+page
  manual shows the opened trace window on page 109 ONLY and doesn't say how to get
  the window open via a tool bar or command: I could be mistaken but I thought FontLab
  Studio had a trace feature in Studio 5. My program has no plug ins or separate modules
  that I know of. It just doesn't seem to be there. THANKS!!\r\n\r\nI spent a few
  hours looking for it. \r\nI will take anything:\r\n\r\n1) A key command to get me
  to the trace setting box\r\n2) A pull down tool (0r)\r\n3) A trace icon tool I can
  click.\r\n\r\nI found nothing and want to build a font off traces of a very nice
  hand sketched letter set.\r\nI could revert to my Fontographer, but want to make
  an OpenType format.\r\n\r\nFolks thanks for any help.\r\nemail me at\r\nJoe\r\nroubideau@gmail.com\r\n\r\n"
