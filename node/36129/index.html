<div class=commentbody>The meeting was great. Lots of enthusiastic folks from the region, plus some folks who came in from NYC and Cleveland just for the event. Many ideas came out of the gathering. We also scouted some very cool locations for special events, tours, and workshop. I'm psyched - Buffalo's going to give us an awesome TypeCon.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sounds great. I grew up in buffalo and still visit friends and family there every summer. I know what kind of amazing things Buffalo has and also know how hard it can be to convince people that have never been there of them. On the other side of that though, when I mention Buffalo to anyone that has visited there, they always light up and mention how wonderful a place it is; whether they are an art lover who has actually made the trip to see the Albright Knox, or just someone who enjoys camping in western New York because "It's beautiful country." So I was shocked when I heard typecon would be there next year. I mean, San Francisco, New York, Boston, Seattle, ... Buffalo. It is a bold and surprising choice. And a great idea.

<div class=commentbody>There were plenty of restaurants in downtown Seattle! All within a five to ten minute walk from the Crowne Plaza. Too bad you missed them. The oysters at The Brooklyn were great!

<div class=commentbody>Greetings All...
<em>Does downtown Buffalo have better, or at least more restaurants than downtown Seattle?
more, no...but an insiders guide will steer you towards gastronomic delights aplenty.</em>
Well, with further investigation there are 51 resturants and bars within .2 miles of the Hotel & 107 within a 1 mile radius. As in all cities there are a couple I would not recommend, but there are a few gems in the mix including the #6 steak house in the county is actually located in the hotel itself. Also, food for thought the bars & clubs do not close until 4 am.

See everyone soon!

<div class=commentbody>I've been to Buffalo about half a dozen times and enjoyed every visit. This trip, we zoomed out to the Roycroft campus (in East Aurora, just 20 minutes from the conference hotel) and toured one of the Karpeles manuscript museums (Buffalo has two). Had dinner at Empire - great food, well-priced, and a menu of deliciously colorful specialty martinis. Went to a networking shindig on the fantail deck of the USS Little Rock - on the waterfront - a gorgeous sunset experience. Played trivia for glory and ate and drank on the cheap at a wings-specializing bar. Took the kiddos bowling at Kenmore Lanes (they have the best bowling alley signage I've seen in a long time). Down by the water again to sugar up the boys at a custard stand much beloved by seagulls. Drove around the city to scope out the beautiful architecture, ghostly lettering on brick walls, and plethora of funky neon. Will hit more museums and check out the wee-hours entertainment when I return in the fall.
There are so many venues for special events and field trips that we are going to have a hard time fitting it all in. But we'll do our best :)

<div class=commentbody>Buffalo shares the same sort of "reputation" that Hamilton has -- "ew, why would anyone ever go <em>there?"</em>
But when you do, it's a great time and you preach your conversion with gusto: I too am looking forward to next year (and being better organized than I was this year!).</div>
