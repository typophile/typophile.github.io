  body: That's an old, predigital typeface called Label Script. Jonathan Smith digitized
    it as <a href="http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/3629" target="_blank">Ol' 54</a>.

  body: Thanks, that is exactly what I was looking for.  I like how the font flows
    together and it adds a little design to each letter without having to spend time
    adding a lot of effects or lines.
