  letters and a floating <strong>c</strong>. And in case you didn't notice how tough
  that logo is, he's got a star, too. \r\n\r\nSo much for boumas. But I have to give
  him credit for approving a presidential campaign design entirely devoid of red and
  blue. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mccainlogo_4428.png]"

  body: "Is that Optima Nova? I like its look. However, the position of the first
    c is distracting, and the tapered rule doesn't go with the type, and the shadowed
    star doesn't go with either. \r\n\r\nThe star and tapered rule say 'tough military'
    but the overall look somewhat confused and contradictory. Another bad omen for
    a candidate?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think he could do better with a titling serif face or something like DIN/Alternate
    Gothic. Mantinia comes to mind, as I can imagine the two c's on McCain fit snuggly
    within each other in the font's double c glyph.\r\n\r\nHas any candidate taken
    the DIN route, btw? Most of them went either the heavy-weight grotesques route,
    or the low ascender/descender serifs route.\r\n\r\nAnd a second thought, I wonder
    if we'll start to see Gotham in these kind of design soon, since the font's usage
    is quite universal, at least in the US."
