  body: "These are approaches to rendering (rasterizing), rather than hinting.\r\n\r\nThe
    approaches have different strengths and weaknesses. My favorite rendering anywhere
    is with a minority of fonts under Windows DirectWrite ClearType. But to my eyes,
    the average font looks better in Apple's current Quartz rendering...."

  body: "I don't know that it matters. In today's business section, the buzz is that
    the Apple is starting to spoil, which comes as no news to me. Why I think so is
    rather complex, but the point of the article is that investors are starting to
    get a little peeved with Apple's stinginess, because the \"value\" of the stock
    is basically all in the price per share, meaning Apple is a good investment as
    long as its market share and appeal are strong. Apple is worth a whole lot of
    dough, but the corporation doesn't like to share.\r\n\r\nOr create American jobs.
    The big money is starting to see a less than rosy future\u2026which, money being
    money and all, may well mean that Apple has peaked, and may be on the way down.\r\n\r\nOS
    X becomes Classic Mac, or iPhone's become pass\xE9? I do not know: I do not have
    access to the big money crystal ball\u2026yet.\r\n\r\nJust kidding. I don't know
    that it's pertinent, but a lot of people who are banking on Apple's innovation
    \"edge\" are starting to get edgy themselves."

    "I don't know that it matters"!! Whatever....

  body: "Old Nick, although I find analysis of Apple's stock price and its popularity
    both interesting, I don't get how they relate to the discussion at hand.\r\n\r\nzeno333:\r\n\r\nApple's
    choice, ignoring built-in hints in favor of on-the-fly autohinting, seems to me
    to be based on the idea that people are going to have a wide variety of fonts,
    and wanting to make as many of them as possible look as good as possible.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's
    approach, relying on hinting in the font (though being less reliant in the newest
    rasterizers), seems to me to be based on the idea that it's important that the
    system fonts look as good as humanly possible, and that it be possible to make
    other fonts look really exceptional with some added work... even if that means
    that random other fonts are going to look worse.\r\n\r\nEach company's choice
    on handling hinting plays fairly well in tandem with their choices on anti-aliasing
    and rendering. They have each made a host of different decisions, but all from
    a consistent philosophical place.\r\n\r\nBecause I am big on having a wide variety
    of fonts and such, I suppose I like Apple's approach a bit better than Microsoft's.
    Though I will admit the degree of fuzz on the anti-aliased text seems excessive,
    at least at old-fashioned resolutions. Once I have a 27+\" retina display on my
    desktop I won't care. Until then, I like Adobe's choices as far as anti-aliasing
    goes."
