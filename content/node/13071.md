  they don't really believe this statement, it is something that they have jokingly
  said to me, \"all fonts are the same, it's just 'fashion'\".  It's an overstatement,
  but I'm working with it.  Having worked for with for and with small business, I
  can say that they can shoot themselves in the foot because they are intimidated
  by designers.  \"They will charge me $10,000 for a logo I don't even want\", that
  kind of thing.  We've all been there...\r\n\r\nBut we all know there are certainly
  other alternatives than the logo itself.  And some simple guidelines can do wonders
  as well.  I don't see those as being so expensive.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I have a few
  general ideas how smart typography can actually help a 'small' business...anybody
  have more they'd like to add?\r\n\r\n- consistency - marketing 101, etc...\r\n-
  use of guidelines can save lots of time and enforces consistency\r\n- brick and
  mortar approach...start simple and build as needed (more design)\r\n- knowledge
  of some of these fundamentals can make you a smarter client - work better with your
  designer (i would hope)\r\n\r\nAdditions?\r\n\r\nMy goal, perhaps it's fruitless
  though, is to teach them some basic type terminology, how to think about appropriate
  usage, what guidelines are, and how to consider choosing a good face.  In the end,
  it will be an e-presentation or whatever the kids call it these days. ;)\r\n\r\nOr,
  is this really a dumb idea and not worth the time.  I was thinking it could be useful
  for other clients in the future...\r\n\r\nMerci...v\r\n\r\n"

    say the same about anything.\r\n\"All wines are the same\", and it's true, they
    do taste pretty much the same (compared to orange juice or beer) -- but you come
    across as uncouth if you admit as much\r\nSo the same is true of fonts.\r\n\r\nIf
    you say \"oh, we won't bother about optimizing some details\", where do you stop
    compromising?\r\nOn the positive side, quality is insidious.\r\nBut the client
    doesn't have to care about every little detail, micro-managing it: leave it to
    the talent to decide what's important.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience, small businesses
    are not particularly marketing-savvy.\r\nThey usually don't have a strong idea
    what differentiates their product from that of their competitors, because they
    don't have marketing specialists on staff. All they know is they love their thing
    and do it right.\r\n\r\nSo the trick is to explain the benefits of a marketing
    strategy which positions them positively in the marketplace with relation to the
    competition. Quality, price, delivery, whatever. And if you can convince them
    of the uniqueness of that proposition, than you can convince them that unique
    creative is part of the plan, and unique typography and fonts contributre to the
    design synergy of their market position. \r\n\r\nIf they'll settle for generic
    fonts and typography, that means they'll look like everbody else and will be reduced
    to competing at the lowest cutthroat level, on price -- and a small business can't
    afford to do that, because large businesses with economy of scale will blow them
    out of the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    me... but i always judge products and services based on packaging and branding.
    i figure, if they don't care enought to \"put their best face forward,\" then
    there are probably other details that they don't care as much about either. i
    think just like good grooming, having a sharp visual identity (part of which includes
    choice of fonts) has everything to do with personal pride."

  body: "I think selling big D design to a small business requires showing how the
    fine details of design (such as visual consistency and good typography) serve
    the large scale goals of the business. Consistency is a very important goal but
    there are some more immediate and appealing aspects you could present. \r\n\r\nPaul
    mentioned a company putting their best face forward. I think that the visual identity
    of a business is the most immediate indicator of the value of their service. I
    would work out a way to show the client how they will benefit from developing
    a well designed visual identity (which inherently contains good typography). I
    would start by researching how their immediate competitors value and use design.
    \r\nGoodluck.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Unfortunately, it's not only small businesses that have little interest in
    branding, let alone fonts or typography.\r\n\r\nNick is on the mark suggesting
    a business marketing approach to your presentation. The only thing that gets attention
    is a way to improve business.\r\n\r\nBut before you start to create a presentation
    to enlighten the company by yourself, I suggest another tact.\r\n\r\nOddly enough,
    if the business owners hired an outside consultant to improve business, and one
    suggestion was to revise branding, they would listen. I know... been there, done
    that.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting that they bring in a business consultant, I suggest
    that you bring in the expertise and plan for success by way of reputable case
    studies. That way you're not stuck trying to educate or convince them. You just
    present the facts that good branding means good business.\r\n\r\nHere are a couple
    of articles to get you started.\r\n\r\nAn excerpt from <cite>INC. magazine</cite>
    on the BrandEquity site:\r\nhttp://www.brandequity.com/news/inc_wm.html\r\nThe
    article speaks for itself - <cite>\"In 2000, the first full year after the redesign,
    the company's sales rose 20%. In 2001, when most shoe companies' revenues decreased
    significantly, White Mountain's sales again shot up 20%\".</cite>\r\n\r\nHere's
    an article by an award-winning consultant:\r\n<cite>Five Tips to Quickly and Inexpensively
    Improve Your Brand Identity</cite>\r\nhttp://www.womeninconsulting.org/consultants/articles/improve-brand-identity.html\r\nIt
    speaks to consistancy of image, use of type, color, layout, etc. accross all material,
    web site, literature, ads and so forth. The outcome being an improved perception
    of the company or product by the target market.\r\n\r\nYou might try searching
    for articles about branding from publications within your client's industry as
    they might hold more weight.\r\n\r\nOne or two success stories should at least
    open the door to a few of your ideas. Even if they decide to start slow, or put
    off revitalizing their image, you bring them proven ways to improve market share
    and profits.\r\n\r\nGood luck.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"

    as possible - a heavy 'should' attitude is a turn off & make sure you present
    your proposal in such a way that it clearly supports their business goals. \r\n\r\nOf
    course if they don't know what their business goals are you may have a nearly-useless
    client. You can't be a coach & a designer...\r\n\r\nWhat Nick said about 'and
    will be reduced to competing at the lowest cutthroat level, on price' is VERY
    true. Design can be a pretty damn significant rung on the ladder out of that hell."

  body: "ALOT of really good comments here.  Instead of simply agreeing with everything
    y'all have said I'll pick out a comment I'm not really digging.\r\n\r\n<em>I think
    that the visual identity of a business is the most immediate indicator of the
    value of their service.</em>\r\n\r\nIt's an \"indicator\" but not always the truth.
    \ We all eat at hole in the wall restaurants that have the most amazing food -
    and we have to wait to get in because everybody in town is there too.  Nothing
    is pretty about them except the food.  There are also many successful businesses
    that have never had more than Times Roman as their entire id program.\r\n\r\nI
    find the major problem being with metrics - can the client measure the value they
    get from creating an identity program?  I personally don't have the resources
    or know-how to do the studies to prove this - aside from the quick, cheap, dirty
    approach.  Let alone getting somebody to pay for the study itself.  But as it
    was mentioned, you need a business expert to say it's good before it's good oftentimes
    (and this is where the bucks really start to add up).  Showing that sales or perception
    have improved is key and can be difficult to define.  Aside from all we've talked
    about this is the hardest point.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to play the part of the client
    here - I know that design is so darn important these days.\r\n\r\nBut, the idea
    is to present a primer.  I don't want to be a coach - been there done that too.\r\n\r\nAnd
    thanks alot to y'all for all the comments."
