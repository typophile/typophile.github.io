  body: "Jason Pagura asked on the FontForge-devel list for someone to comment on
    the state of FontForge. \r\n\r\nThe history page at http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/ff-history.html
    currently stops with my requests for a Cairo canvas, and Pango UI text, and then
    improvements to the themes code; that was in late 2008 as I recall. \r\n\r\nSince
    then the main software developer, George Williams, took up running more seriously
    - he blogs at http://georgeruns.wordpress.com/ - and his interest in FontForge
    has waned considerably. \r\n\r\nToday a small group of people contribute small
    improvements and you can see the changes at http://fontforge.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fontforge/fontforge;a=log
    \r\n\r\nMy experience with FontForge over the last 6 years has been that George
    is interested in working on technically challenging features because those provide
    a fun way to spend his retirement, and he is not interested in non-technically-challenging
    features like improvements to the UI. He has designed the UI to make sense to
    him, and so he has no reason to change it :-)\r\n\r\nAnyway, the points of this
    thread is about how to install FontForge. I think the best way to install FontForge
    is to do so directly from this daily Git source code repository. It is straightforward
    on GNU/Linux, and on Mac OS X with HomeBrew. For Windows, I haven't used it in
    10 years and have no idea :-)"

    instructions on [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/source-build.html]] are both
    confusing and seriously outdated, as are the builds based on the 2011-02-02 tarball
    provided by the various package managers (e.g.: Homebrew, Fink, Macports, etc.).\r\n\r\nCan
    the documentation be updated to reflect these new, straightforward installation
    methods? Is George the only one with the keys to this castle?"
