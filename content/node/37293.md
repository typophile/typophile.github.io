body: "Hey Guys & Girls, at the end of this year I will have finished my Bachelor
  of Design and will be looking for placement within an agency as an entry level designer.\r\n\r\nCV
  questions\r\n\r\nI have no previous full-time/part-time employment in the design
  industry should I put down freelance works I have done?\r\n\r\nShould I display
  my past employment if its not design relevant? \r\n\r\n\r\nPortfolio questions\r\n\r\nMy
  best work has always been done at university, so should I only use my university
  work or is it best to show some freelance work I've done so that they can see what
  I do for actual clients? \r\n\r\nShould I display a variety of work, or try and
  limit it to the scope of the agency I am applying for?\r\n\r\nAny advice would be
  really appreciated\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"

    in obtaining the position.\r\n\r\nMy advice is to include everything you've ever
    done to show advancement, and having your <i>own</i> URL (not university-provided
    space) is good to have onsite.\r\n\r\nI have a blog of my time so far <a href=\"http://www.paulwilsdon.com\">here</a>
    if you want a heads up of what to expect(ish).\r\n\r\nEvery piece of freelance
    is good stock, but University work is also good to have (especially if your personal
    work is lacking in amount).\r\n\r\nAbove all, wear a suit to every interview -
    it'll help make that essential first impression, and show how serious & dedicated
    you are to your craft.\r\n\r\nBest of luck!\r\n\r\nPaul"

  body: "\"Should I display my past employment if its not design relevant?\"\r\n\r\nI
    wouldn't list \"flipped burgers for a semester at BK\" but if the job is interesting,
    absolutely. Work experience is work experience. And definitely list your freelance
    works/talents.\r\n\r\n\"Above all, wear a suit to every interview\"\r\n\r\nI don't
    know if I'd agree with that. Scout out the firm first. If the principals are wearing
    t-shirts and flip-flops, a suit might be a bit overkill. Design firm dress code
    can run the gamut."

    an interview in a design agency for the position of junior designer? That would
    really <cite>show how serious & dedicated you are to your craft</cite> - as an
    undertaker, accountant or TV news anchor yes, but junior designer no. In fact

  body: "If you have past employment that is not directly design-related, but you
    learned or demonstrated transferable skills, I would include it: No need to detail
    your job duties, but do talk about the skills you used to perform the duties.
    \r\n\r\nSo, for example, I worked for a few years as a sales person in a dressmaking
    supply shop. It was far from the work I do producing publications, but I was using
    and developing problem solving skills in a way which does relate to design --
    finding a solution within the customer's budget and which would complement the
    look of whatever they were making/repairing/sewing. \r\n\r\nSkills are transferable.
    For example, timeliness, attention to detail, accuracy... You can list the skills
    a particular position required of you. \r\n\r\nAlso, any accomplishments -- like
    improving a work process or signage or reorganizing something, increasing sales,
    developing a loyal clientele ... in other words, a contribution other than your
    basic duties.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    a very highly respected agency in the UK. I got successfully placed with a fantastic
    studio, and I'm simply relaying how I managed it.\r\n\r\nAbove all, a suit asserts
    sensibility, style and a commitment which a hoodie & pair of trainers cannot.\r\n\r\nLet
    us know how you get on Miguel!"

  body: "If you have just finished your university degree, most employers are not
    going to be expecting a long list of fabulous jobs. I'd advise summarizing your
    work experience briefly, as it's not design-related. You do want to show you've
    had some work experience but you don't need to go into overkill explaining how
    skillfully you stocked those grocery shelves. In general I think descriptions
    of your jobs should be brief and to the point.\r\n\r\nYes, show both your school
    work and your completed jobs. Again, nobody is expecting you to have designed
    the iPhone interface.\r\n\r\nBut please please avoid the common student mistake
    of too many words on the CV. I can't stand lengthy \"objectives\" (your objective
    is to get a f**king job, innit?). Someone on this site posted a 6 page CV for
    critique where we had to page thru 5 pages of words words words before we even
    got to the actual resume. Something elegant and concise is vastly preferable.
    It should fit on a page. I have 20+ years work experience and my resume fits on
    a page.\r\n\r\nAs to wearing a suit? Seems a little much to me, but don't show
    up in jeans either. Black or grey pants, a simple button down (no tie) and a jacket
    should do the trick."

    only your best work -- do not put anything in there that you will be apologizing
    for. It's better to have 3 or 4 very good samples than 8 or 10 that vary in quality
    or execution.\r\n\r\nAlso, do your homework about the firms you will be applying
    to, and if possible, tailor the contents of your portfolio to a particular studio's
    work.\r\n\r\n(And if you can get it, I recommend the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Designer-Without-Losing-Your/dp/1568985592/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_k2a_2_txt/102-9738191-2107322?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-2&pf_rd_r=1RR799MZJ7X2QNPPYXVZ&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_p=304485601&pf_rd_i=B000SKUI6S\"><em>How

    go a step above what the office is. If it is t-s and torn jeans, then a tie is
    overkill. But if it is dress shirts and slacks, then throw on a tie. And if they
    have on a tie, go up to a full suit. (The rule breaks down here ... if they are
    in suits, a tux is a bit too much).\r\n\r\nJust don't scope out the place on a
    Friday to see what the normal dress is ... many places dress down that day."
