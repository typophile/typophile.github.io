  from a car spray paint touch up paint can. I thought it was Banana Split, but it's
  not. The second is a heavy italic font. The brand is Spanish if that helps at all.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/touch-up_5621.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mtn-mtn_3841.jpg]"

    Not the same, but I've seen Candace used way too much and this typeface has some
    nice alternates.
