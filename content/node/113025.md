    of script is sometimes called miniscule.\r\nI found an interesting page with samples
    including some that have similarities. For example a 13th Century English Chancery
    Hand from Germany http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/scripts/examples/c13chancery.htm
    and other minisucles and cursives etc. http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/scripts/scrindex.htm\r\nDon"

  body: "Sorry, but I do not think that the 13th Century English Chancery Hand from
    Germany is similar to the hand in the \u2018Annals of Quedlinburg\u2019 as shown
    here. Shure, both can be described as minuscule, but minuscule includes a fairly
    wide range of styles which is known as \u2018lower case\u2019 in typography. The
    example shown on [[http://www.medievalwriting.50megs.com|mediavalwriting]] has
    a roman / an interrupted construction (two-story a and g, no upstroke in the n).
    The Annals of Quedlinburg are written with a cursive / running construction (one
    story a and g, upstroke in n). Also it has to be noted that on Wikipedia the following
    is stated: \u2018The original document has disappeared, surviving only as a 16th-century
    copy held in Dresden\u2019. This means that the text is based on / copied from
    annals probably written between 1008 and 1030, but this does not tell us anything
    on how the script in the original document may have looked like. When the description
    of the document as shown on Wikipedia is accurate enough, this could be the Dresden
    version from the 16th century. The script is a humanist cursive as we know it
    from the italian writing masters such as Arrighi and Palatino. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_Vicentino_degli_Arrighi|Arrighi]]
    published his writing method in his book Il Operina around 1524. A facsimile which
    includes a translated version can be found at the website of Gunnlaugur SE Briem:
