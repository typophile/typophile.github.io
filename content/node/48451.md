  it. Eomer at the beginning meant to be capitals only. Later, however, as I added
  lc characters, I realised I liked them very much. Still, it was intented to be a
  bold display face, for short snippets of text, maybe titles, but certainly not for
  lengthy passages of small text. It features over 95% of the Western glyphs set plus
  a selected few Central European ones. Metrics has not been finalised, and Kerning
  is yet to be done.\r\n\r\nAll comments are welcome.\r\n\r\nTybor"

    be popular with T-shirts of the hipsters nowadays.\r\n\r\ndaniel"

    It might help you resolve some of your concerns to work in a modular environment
    too.

    admirably well, given the difficulties of diagonals in this format. V not so much..."

  body: "T-shirts, yes! A friend of mine liked it so much, he used the prototype for
    stencil graffiti.\r\n\r\nFontstruct is great. The people there have created some
    outstanding works. The only problem lies in the inherent limitations what comes
    with ease of use. Yes, Eomer is a good case for Fontstruct because its modular
    and geometric. But once you get to the accented characters you need more control
    over precise positioning. This is my first font to include such characters, and
    I spent long hours just to get them right. See new attachment.\r\n\r\nI am happy
    you liked the K and X. I have to admit I am quite comfortable with V, because
    it is unusual and it refers to B. But yes, it is a compromise. However, I am less
    sure about the K. It looks a bit imbalanced. I might have to change that.\r\n\r\n"
