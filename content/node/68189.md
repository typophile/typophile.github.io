  the heart shape too.\r\n\r\nI've looked on myfonts.com and I think I've identified
  the L - as Biscotti OT, though not sure it's a perfect match? - the attached image
  isn't great\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/L-and-heart_4580.gif]\r\n\r\nAs
  for the heart shape - any ideas where to start looking or anyone know of anything
  similar?\r\n\r\nHope you can help?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nBrian\r\n\r\n"

    is the font, unless you found something else by that name. There is no ball terminal
    on the bottom stroke of that L, and the overall stroke and letter shape is not
    right. \r\n\r\nI have been looking, but have not found a match yet for the L,
    and I'm starting to think the whole thing may be hand-drawn. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Hi Mike, thanks for the reply - I think you're right about this one. I ended
    up going for a completely different font in the end. It was driving me mad trying
    to match it! - Best wishes - Brian
