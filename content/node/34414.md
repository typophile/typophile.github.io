  them.\r\n\r\nSo far the handwritten fonts I like are:\r\n\r\nFelt Tip Roman\r\nFF
  Hands\r\nMVB Calliope\r\nMarydale\r\nProfessor\r\n\r\nThese feel like Fresh, young
  contemporary handwritten fonts. Like the ones Domino mag uses! (Do you know what
  handwritten fonts they use?)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm not looking for:\r\n\r\nFF Providence
  is too childlike.\r\nBrisa is good, but not sophisticated enough. (I feel that way
  about FF Hands too slightly)\r\nHandsome Pro is too cute.\r\nVoluta Script Pro is
  way too scripty and not natural, fresh, or real looking.\r\nP22 Pop art comic is
  cool, but not what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nAny other fresh, young, contemporary
  handwritten fonts out there? I have already looked at the \"Contemporary Handwriting
  Fonts\" newsletter from that one font place (as you can tell by my list).\r\n"

  body: Thanks. I've seen that Script ID Guide a lot here, but now i'm taking a look.
    I've seen the handwriting thing here and pulled from there as much as I could.
    Eye Catching is a good one.

    designers handwriting. We tweaked it for them, and adjusted a few things, but
    that is all it is. Jump in, use your own handwriting and use one of those handwriting
    conversion services.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: Or better yet, just write it out. That's what I'm doing for a book I'm designing
    - all the headlines, running feet and leadins. Of course it's a pain when they
    edit it... but nothing looks quite like handwriting.

  body: i have a friend with just the "right" handwriting... on several projects,
    i have called him up and commissioned his writing of specific heads for a fee.
    for other projects, i have used my own hand.
