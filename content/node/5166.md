body: This is the font that is part of the logo for my band, but the original creator
  lost it and doesn&#39;t remember what font it is or where he got it.  I am trying
  to create some vector graphics for posters and banners, and I don&#39;t want to
  have to completely recreate the logo.  Any help in identifying and locating this
  font would be appreciated.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37992.jpg"
