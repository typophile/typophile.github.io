  find a font close to the one in the 49ers \"SF\" helmet. A client wants to use something
  like it. I would really appreciate your help. \r\n\r\nThank you! \r\n\r\n  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/p5959961dt_4069.jpeg]"

    is about the closest; unfortunately, it's only available as a grunge font. It
    must have been based on something else, but I can't find it.\r\n\r\n[[http://content.sportslogos.net/logos/7/179/full/4965.gif|Here's
    a link to the logo ]] that  has the matching 4, 9, E, and R \r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/clarendon-extended/clarendon-extended/|Clarendon
    extended (Wood Type Fonts)]] is also quite close, but the serifs are somewhat
    different.\r\n\r\nAll terminate the leg on the R differently as well.\r\n\r\nHerb
