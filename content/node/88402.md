  body: Sense?  The issue is control of the internet just like they do in China.  Censorship
    by interest groups.  It has nothing to do with piracy and everything to do with
    greed.  The guys pushing for this bill could care less if someone pirates William's
    Caslon.

    web sites that have purchased web font licenses.

  body: "I found a better explanation of what is going on [[http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/sopa-vote-delayed/|here]].\r\n\r\nI
    found this passage particularly interesting: \r\n\r\n\"On Thursday, Chaffetz and
    a host of other lawmakers asked Smith to stop the hearing so that the committee
    could bring in experts to testify. But Smith had refused, and the committee voted
    22-12 to leave the DNS redirect and firewall provisions intact.\r\n\r\nThe committee
    heard from the Motion Picture Industry Association of America at a SOPA hearing
    last month, but has never called an expert on internet architecture. It was not
    immediately clear who Smith would ultimately line up.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently Chairman
    Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) follows Texas Republican rules: Only my side gets to talk.
    If you have years of experience, and know what you're talking about, shut the
    fuck up. Seems fair :)   \r\n"

    a response in the mail. Unfortunately the response was a form letter about something
    else :( http://www.dunwichtype.com/?p=2060\r\n\r\nIf SOPA passes in the Senate
    it may be time to kick the Democrats out into the wilderness again. That might
    be the only way to get it through their dense heads that if Americans gave a damn
    for neoliberalism, we would all just vote for Republicans and get tax cuts to
    boot."
