I'm using Adobe Garamond 10/13.2 (poet/author wants slightly larger leading), and I do think Garamond sets small, but I think we should use either 10 pt or 11 pt and not something strange like 10.6.

Any advice is much appreciated.

Could you set at 11 & let the author <em>think</em> it was 10.6? ;-)

welcome to Typophile.

Technically, there is no reason not to use odd point sizes.
If 11p looks too large and 10p too small, then go for it. Absolutely valid, with today’s digital tools.

Would you argue that the difference between 10 and 11 pt and something in between can't be seen?

		<div class="commentbody">Stephanie,

Actually, it happens fairly often. If you're the designer/typesetter & text files have been supplied, you can fairly quickly set a lot of the text. Often, there will be a setting where things just work better -- say, for a particular text, 10.6/13 x 25.5 (or 25p6 in NEWSPEAK). I've been known to play with measure in 1/4 pica increments, and as your client suggests, type size in 10ths of a point. The optimal leading is also affected by the measure (well, margins) & type size. All this can lead to specifications not possible with old typesetting systems, even computer-based ones.

When you get the *right* sizes, things just sort of click. The spacing looks right, you don't have too many widows, too many hyphens, etc. etc. Perhaps less an issue with poetry, though you still have the visuals of measure, margins, & turned lines to accommodate.

FWIW</div>

"Would you argue that the difference between 10 and 11 pt and something in between can’t be seen?"

As a lay person I don't have the expertise to judge, but I am saying it's odd that the author (also one presumes not the layout expert) came upon such a figure, apparently in advance of trying 11. That's why I say "spuriously precise". 
From my lay perspective if I was the client I imagine I would say I wanted the work "a bit bigger", or with "a bit more leading", and let the designer decide an appropriate point size. 
In comparison in my line of work as a pharmacist I will round up or down a dose derived by a doctor which is over-precise for no good reason in my professional opinion, or in practical terms is to a precision which is not measurable (e.g., give 4.8ml using a 5ml spoon).

In essence, 10.6 may be exactly right, but I would trust the professional's judgement to arrive at that.

Thanks,
Paul</div>

When working with newspapers and other publications to define the perfect blend of size, leading and line length, we land on fractional point sizes all the time. 

When working with screen resolutions other than 72 and 144 dpi, operating systems and thus applications, automatically use fractional point sizes, almost exclusively. 

Cheers!
