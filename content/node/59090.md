body: Hi folks, my wedding is coming up and I've drawn up a monogram/ligature for
  us to use. It's based on Aphrodite, but I've tried to redraw it to do what I want.
  I'm having some trouble taming the Bezier curves to feel right...I'm curious at
  this point to see what others think before I continue with this! Please help!

  body: Forms are pretty solid. I'd just bring the ampersand and A away from the H
    a little bit.
