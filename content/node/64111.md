    what it's worth also found that <a href=\"http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/11895\">York

  body: "Akira, Thanks for pointing that out ;-)\r\n\r\nStavros. Custom type, I'm
    afraid. This York Script doesn't seem to be some rip-off from another typeface
    (see backround below)\r\n\r\nBrendel Informatik GmbH; Wilhelm Welsch's Cologne-based
    outfit that sells all the standard fonts, many under new names. Typically about
    1DM per font (in packs of 500). Goes also under the name Quick Brown Fox (QBF),
    and is related to (identical to?) Softmaker. In the seventies, they made some
    original fonts at Brendel Type Studio such as Diamante and Dragon, but what is
    the relationship between Brendel Type Studio and Brendel Informatik? Their collection
    grew and included many semi-clones from major foundries (example: Equipe is like
    Emigre's Mason, and so forth). In 2000, FontShop sued them for placing 17 of their
    fonts on their CD, and Brendel lost and had to cough up a lot of money. Mark Johannson
    explains: \"The B+P fonts seem to be the earliest and now float freely between
    Brendel Informatik and Softmaker 's, sometimes renamed, sometimes not. Brendel
    also did fonts for Serif software (Page Plus, Draw Plus etc.) using the SF suffix.
    It is not unusual, if you open the SF/Softmaker/Brendel/BP fonts up with a font
    editor, that you'll find one of the other company's names for it still buried
    in there in either the TT or T1 ID field!! I'm guessing Softmaker (in Nuremberg)
    was a software publisher who acquired some type of rights along the lines. They
    still make software (Softmaker Office is their biggie) and still sell fonts. Brendel
    still operates out of Cologne and still sells fonts under the \"Quick Brown Fox\"
    foundry name. The catalogs between them are pretty identical even down to most
    font names.\""

    the price for the quality stuff is affordable. Go for the big vendors and I'm
    sure you'll find something appropriate. I made a quick search at Identifont and
    found this;\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/show?TH. From there you should be able
    to find similar scripts and where to buy them.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Many things said on that \"Font Forging Industry\" web site are true, but
    some of them are false, and there are a fair number of misleading things stated
    or implied on that site. Most notably, the use of the term \"forging\" is not
    consistent with normal English usage: in English a \"forgery\" is something which
    claims to be something valuable which it is not. Most of the cases Uli writes
    about are cases where something imitates something else, but under a different
    name, OR is in fact stolen material under a different name.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "York Script (a.k.a Yorkshire) is a revival of an old film type as far as
    I know. It is shown in the Solotype Catalog on p.96, as part of a series of Y
    and Z named script styles. I realize these names may have been Solotype's own
    inventions in many cases. \"Yorkshire\" seems identical and shows up in a 1993
    German type book of Script Types as coming from a foundry called Typo Bach in
    Frankfurt and Munich. Whose revival is legitimate is not easy to say in many cases,
    although reputations have been established by the type community, presumably based
    on some knowledge that I don't have. Opti had a York Script, and I know of three
    other aliases used by sources of fonts I do not trust at all.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
