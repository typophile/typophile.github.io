  but the whole site looks awesome! Going to be spending some time here when I can...\r\n\r\nIn
  the meantime I have the inevitable font ID question - if anyone can help I'd be
  most grateful. The 'K' should be a giveaway... but isn't. The 'S' is pretty special
  too.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance - Chris\r\n\r\n\r\n"
