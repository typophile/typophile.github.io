  note note the double t's in Massachusetts, have different lengths, and the F's in
  Follow and Five are slightly different.  Perhaps these are ligatures within the

    is also similar in feeling.\r\nI'm sorry Stewf, but even <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000247\">Shoebop</a>
    is closer in spirit than what you've suggested. >^p"
