body: My help has seemed to have stopped working. I open it and its just blank, usually
  theres the osX logo. I type a word to search for and it doesnt search or find anything.
  <BR> <BR>Where is the osX help kept on my computer could I just copy the files from
  another that works and replace, would this work? <BR> <BR>Has anyone experienced
  this problem before? <BR> <BR>Thanks for any help, <BR> <BR>David.

  body: I think I have the same problem. If I launch help, I get a new window and
    nothing else. If I go into Terminal &amp; check &#34;top&#34; processes, Help
    is grinding away, using 90%&#43; of the processor, but going nowhere. <BR> <BR>I
    haven&#39;t been able to find anything about this. Sorry.

  body: I had a similar problem where help would launch and then close. I did all
    sorts of maintenance over three months with no fix. I order Disc Warrior
