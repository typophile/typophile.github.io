body: "I read <em>Going Bovine</em>. Despite all the funky space-time travel, it was
  mostly the font that nibbled at my brain after I read it.  I apologize for asking
  you to go to [[http://www.amazon.ca/Going-Bovine-Libba-Bray/dp/0385733976|Amazon]]
  (click on the book cover to see the font) to look at it, Typophile wouldn't let
  me upload the screenshot. Can anyone ID this one?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Helvetica Neue Ultra Light. It should be Condensed, but I think it might actually
    be bastardised and squashed up via InDesign/Quark/whatever.

  body: 'Thanks, Walkway is exactly the font that was used on the cover. I was actually
    wondering what was used in the body of the book, but the image is really grainy
    and difficult to read. '
