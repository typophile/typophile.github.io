  there a list somewhere, or could we perhaps make one right now?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Great tip! The "RMX Add MM weight axis" seems a great tool. I was just looking
    for something like this.

  body: "goran,\r\n\r\nif you are looking for tools to use on your own work, another
    way to go about it would be to ask:\r\n\r\n1. what kind of macros do i need to
    make my work easier/faster/possible?\r\n2. are there free macros which do these
    things?\r\n3. if not -- who is able to write such macros, and how much would it
    cost?\r\n\r\nyou can try to write your own stuff -- do you know <a href=\"htp://www.robofab.org/\">robofab</a>?
    the documentation is very good and contains lots of samples, and people on the
    <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/robofab/\">mailing list</a> are always
    willing to help.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n- gustavo."
