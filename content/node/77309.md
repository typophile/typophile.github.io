body: "Anyone have some ideas on what fonts might be in this logo? It's from the top
  of an old notepad. Note the phone number. It's from the early years of 7 digit phone
  numbers, when people were still using the old two letter codes for the first two
  digits of the number. That dates the notepad to somewhere between 1947 and the mid
  1950's.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is the rather extreme italic angle, I've already
  done a re-creation of this for a personal letterhead, changed the words and number
  of course. To get close to that angle I had to use an italic font and apply pseudo
  italic to it in Photoshop then I had to further lean it over a bit using skew. I
  used some variety of Franklin Gothic, close but not quite, it has the lower tail
  on the G which this logo doesn't, and some other little differences.\r\n\r\nFor
  the line of small text, I couldn't find anything anywhere near close, so I just
  used a font that looked somewhat similar then used Photoshop's adjusting tools to
  mush it around to fit the overall width and height.\r\n\r\nI'd like to find fonts
  that are closer matches, if possible."

  body: "I don't know about the logo offhand. The rest sure looks like Franklin Gothic.
    The original, of course, not the sanitized ITC version. That weight which is relatively
    bold was the \"regular\" in the original.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/franklin-gothic/roman/\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Yup, except for that G. Could be the designer just trimmed it off.
