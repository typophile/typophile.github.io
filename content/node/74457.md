  title=\"Among many other words\">has been added to the Oxford English Dictionary</a>,
  a statement that requires explanation: The word has been added to the electronic
  corpus, not to any specific print dictionary.\r\n\r\nYou can probably search OED
  Online through your library, but for the hell of it, here\u2019s the entry (emphasis
  added):\r\n\r\n<cite>ogonek</cite>, n.\r\nA diacritic resembling a hook ( \u0328),
  which is placed beneath a letter.\r\nThe ogonek is used in Polish to indicate nasalization
  of a vowel; the diacritic also occurs in some other languages, typically (but not
  always) with this function.\r\n\r\n1981 Yellow Bk. (Internat. Telecomm. Union) 80
  Capital U with ogonek. 1995 F. DE LAGUNA <cite>Tales from Dena</cite> IV. 78 An
  ogonek or hook ( \u0328\u0328) under a vowel indicates that it is nasalized. <strong>2002
  A. TWARDOCH in J. D. Berry <cite>Lang. Culture Type</cite> 155 In uppercase \u0118,
  ogonek should be attached at the baseline near the right part of the baseline stroke.</strong>

  Olympia Monica with a standard QWERTY keyboard supplemented by exotic Polish diacritics
  such as the kreska, ogonek and superior dot.\r\n\r\n"
