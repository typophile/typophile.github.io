  body: "I'm not sure, perhaps some kind of customized (or reworked) Didot. I should
    probably say something like \"Please remember to read the sticky notes in the
    Type ID forum next time you're posting!\", but the only good way to adress that
    problem is creating a different ID posting method, IMO.\r\n\r\nThe magazine is
    New Work Magazine, and this is issue #3 I think. "
