    of Caslon, and then I checked such possibilities as Palatino, Weiss Roman, De
    Roos, Aldus Roman, Diotima...

  body: "Oh, wow, interesting thread Hrant. What a great find! Like you I was especially
    admiring the lowercase /a/ and the uppercase /U/, which was what reminded me of
    Perpetua. I like the foot serifs on /a/, /d/ and /u/ too. I checked out your lovely
    specimen and noticed the Q is very different to the one in this encyclopedia,
    which has an almost straight tail and looked out of place to me. I'll post an
    image when I get home.\r\n\r\nIs it me or is the comma different between the roman
    and italic?\r\n\r\nDid you start digitising it? I think it's a lovely face. I
    can post more images if you're interested.\r\n\r\nThanks for recognising it anyway!

    your Emerson stuff - it might make for an interesting discussion, not least about
    the behind-the-scenes relevance of punchcutters.\r\n\r\nBTW, what's the effective
    resolution on your camera macro? I have a lowly RDC-7 (3.7 megapixel) but because
    the macro can go as close as 1cm the effective resolution is over 2000dpi. Here's
    an example, at about 1700dpi:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4177363425/sizes/o/in/set-72157622858884157/\r\n\r\nThe

  body: "Had I seen a copy of the Golden Encyclopedia, I would probably have just
    ignored the typeface, assuming the book to have been in a typeface I never saw
    before because of being printed in Hungary or somewhere like that to save money.\r\n\r\nIt
    is a beautiful typeface, but I can also understand why it was not successful.
    The italic looks particularly bad in the absence of any kerning. I would suspect
    the rights to digitize the face belong to Monotype, and, were they to do so, since
    a digital version would be properly kerned, the face would have a chance of achieving
    its potential - basically, as competition to Palatino; an oldstyle typeface comparable
    to Bembo or Caslon, but with a very modern design sensibility in some areas, such
    as the serif at the bottom of the lowercase y.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it has \"hybrid
    numerals\" - like those in Microsoft's Georgia - is interesting. I had not known
    that there were legitimate examples of this; although it's certainly useful in
    avoiding confusion for modern readers, some people will react to a 1 that doesn't
    look like an I in non-ranging numerals as an indication of typographic illiteracy
    - instead of simply a creative and original touch. As I noted in the thread on
    Al Gore, though, people are familiar with hybrid numerals in typewriter faces.\r\n\r\nThus,
    if hybrid numerals were hybridized a second way - so that while certain digits
    did extend below the baseline, or above the digit height, they did so by small
    amounts, and the numeral height was only slightly less than the cap height - then
    the ranging-style 1 would be perceived as normal."

  body: "Yeah, the italic looks less successful than the regular to me too. I somehow
    like the charm of the no-kerning predigital era.\r\n\r\nHrant, I'm afraid I don't
    know quite how to calculate effective resolution as I'm a newbie to digital technology.
    Most of my photos are done with slide film. However my new camera has 15 megapixels
    and my old 70mm f2.8 Sigma lens can focus at a minimum distance of less than 20cm.
    The results should be awesome \u2014 I haven't had a chance to try it out as I
    need to buy a memory card tomorrow. \r\n\r\nBut here's the previous pic zoomed

    in terms of rights, would it simply be a matter of contacting Monotype? How would

    That Q poked me in the eye because the font looks the same but isn't. It just
    looks funny to me. (Forgive my naivete here, I know next to nothing about predigital
    technology.)

    the <em>all caps</em> headings of the entries in the encyclopedia.\r\n\r\nThey
    may have even partly chosen Emerson for its \"hybrid\" numerals, having the charm
    of old-style numerals while not being confusing to the younger readers of the
    encyclopedia.\r\n\r\nHowever, Emerson does share one important attribute with
    Perpetua: the upper-case U looks like a lower-case U, having a tail. Plantin,
    as your image illustrates, doesn't. So they may have picked it to avoid something
    confusing to younger readers.\r\n\r\nIt could also be, however, that Plantin was
    simply part of the Golden Books visual identity for some of their covers.\r\n\r\nOh,
    I've just thought of a simpler reason. When Monotype obtained permission to make
    a version of Spiral, they added an italic. But the accounts of that I've seen
    never mentioned them adding a <strong>bold</strong>. So, once they decided to
    use Emerson, but they wanted to begin entries with their names in bold, they had
    to use another face just to <em>get</em> a bold."

    I checked American Type Design and Designers by David Consuegra. Page 91 says
    <cite> \"The first version of Spiral had no italics... In 1934 the Roman version
    was cut, and the following year, the italic. The typeface's name was then changed
