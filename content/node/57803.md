body: "Hey folks,\r\n\r\nI was linked to this article today about a project creating
  a set of wood type and their reverses. In an effort to save money and time (he was
  a student at the time), he tried to create generalized elements that could be used
  multiple times. The final result is a pretty cool combination of chromatic and monochrome
  lettering. If you are interested in creation your own wood type, it is a really
  interesting read and it documents the process really well; even with some videos
  of the letters being drilled!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nicksherman.com/design/Intercut/\"
