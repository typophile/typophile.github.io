  body: "Thank you Frode. \r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/58975|Your request for an
    id]] on the script in the New Work Magazine was probably the trigger that made
    me draw this. I had taken a look at Linotypes Gneisenauette, but found the contrast
    too low for the sample you provided. But it was the contrast I liked in the image
    you posted, so I decided to go ahead and create something myself (combining it
    with the sources mentioned above). Hopefully creating something unique enough
    to differentiate from Gneisenauette.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "How nice. I'd love to see how this turns out.\r\n\r\nSome trouble spots:
    x z y k\r\n\r\n'n' and 'm' should probably be wider, and I think you should consider
    using the same right stem for 'h'. 'u' and 'y' also curl inwards, which seems
    a bit wierd."

    agree the 'k', 'x' and 'z' might look a bit too 'constructed' at the moment, but
    I havn't found a solution for those yet, although I think the straightened 'z'
    might be a step in the right direction."

  body: "Very fascinating script. There's a very appealing irregural rhythm to it.\r\n\r\nI
    think there could be a bit too much stress on the upright strokes, though. There's
    not much distinction between 'a' and 'u', for example. The loop of the 'e' and
    the curve of the 'c' are also a bit difficult to see.\r\n\r\nWhy are the 'h' and
    'n' different in structure? I would prefer a similar arc in the latter as in the
    former.\r\n\r\nI realize a part of the visual appeal of the script is in its stroke-contrast,
    but it could be a bit more readable if the hairlines were a touch thicker. (I
    don't mean as thick as in Gneisenauette, though.)"

  body: "Sorry, I hadn't noticed someone replied here.\r\n\r\nThank you for the comments.\r\nI
    agree that the hairlines should become a bit thicker, which might also help the
    'c' and 'a' become more easily recognizable as such.\r\n\r\nThe difference between
    the 'h' and 'n' is due to the 'm'. The 'm' doesn't work with the inward bend on
    the last stroke, so I tried and outward bend there. Then the 'n' had to be a close
    match to the 'm', so got the same outward bend. That whole outward ebnd might
    not be working very well, because it is only used in 'n' and 'm' as outward, while
    on other characters 'a', 'u', etc. it is used as inward. Which might confuse the
    reader.\r\n\r\nI find it hard to proceed with this script, though. Especially
    because of the right-tilted brush-stroke. If anyone knows of any examples of scripts
    with a right-tilted brush-stroke, please let me know."
