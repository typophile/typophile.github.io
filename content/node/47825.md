  seems it's out of print and rather hard to find - at a reasonable price, at least!\r\nI
  was wondering if any of you might know where to get a new/good condition copy either
  in Canada or from a bookshop that ships to Canada (the cheaper the better, of course
  ;-)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "If it hadn't been a present from my dad, I'd give you my copy. It's too thoroughly
    riddled with errors for me to take it seriously. At least on my first half dozen
    tries I found I could open to any spread and find a half-truth or misleadingly
    incomplete statement. I actively recommend *not* reading or using this book.\r\n\r\n-
    he talks about features specific to specific foundries' cuts of Baskerville, Bodoni
    and Caslon as if they were features of the broader typeface. To read this book
    you'd think there was only one digital version of Caslon! (I know Adobe Caslon
    is the most common digital Caslon, but even Adobe sells a bunch of other Caslons.)\r\n\r\n-
    there's dubious advice on bold and italic as formatting that clearly indicates
    that he's never used a Windows computer or dealt with cross-platform issues.\r\n\r\n-
    his comments on legibility cite Sir Cyril Burt. This is the guy whose studies
    on identical twins were found to use made up data. I'm thinking I wouldn't cite
    Sir Cyril's work as evidence of anything.\r\n\r\n- despite being published in
    2004, and having lots of info specific to nearly-modern digital type, the writing
    is stuck in the 1990s. There's info on expert sets and supplemental fonts and
    inputting ligatures manually... and no mention of OpenType.\r\n\r\n- the page
    describing the prime and double-prime shows instead an opening quote and opening
    double-quote.\r\n\r\nThat's not an exhaustive list. I just opened to a spread
    and looked until I found an error or omission, and then opened to another spread.
    I always found one.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say there isn't tons of good content
    in here as well. Clearly, he knows a lot about typography. It's just that I require
    a lower error rate and something that is more up to date to recommend it.\r\n\r\nI
    see Amazon US has used copies for as low as $27 for the hardcover (oddly, the
    paperback is more expensive at $38.99). For some reason Amazon.ca's prices are
    rather more stratospheric.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the entire book is set in a neo-grotesque
    sans (Univers, perhaps?). Ugh. But I must say, if one is going to set a 159-page
    book in a neo-grotesque, the way he does it is the way to go: narrow ragged-right
    columns and adequate line spacing. However, in the body text the type size feels
    a bit tiny and anemic for the weight of the typeface, and the captions the bold
    weight causes the tiny neo-grot type to pretty much close up, noticeably harming
    legibility.\r\n"

    a copy at a university library not far from my place, so I might just take a closer
    look at it there.\r\nI only browsed through the book some time ago and thought
    it looked interesting based on the illustrations."

    it's not just you, it's everybody. It's not enough to have good content, a good
    book has to have very little bad content. The reason is that the only way to separate
    the two is if you already know the material! :-/  The people who actually need
    a book need to be able to trust it first.\r\n\r\nBTW, I have an unused copy of
    Jury's \"Letterpress: New applications for traditional skills\" (2006) if anybody
    is interested. Being mostly visual (and nicely composed actually) it can't be
    TOO error-prone...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
