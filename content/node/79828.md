body: "I am designing a brand for a company that does technical, scientific analysis
  of artistic and creative things, and therefore I am trying to pair an industrial,
  geometric sans (DIN, Geogrotesque, or similar) with a hand-written script. I like
  stuff in the realm of Da Vinci's handwriting with a little \"roughness\" but it
  is important that it isn't difficult to read. \r\n\r\nNo formal scripts.\r\n\r\nSomething
  like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typo5/californya/|Californya]] is in the right
  neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nSuggestions? "

    in a book, for titling, with, I think, interesting results. Don't know if it fits
    your needs but I strongly suggest it.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/betatype/dear-sarah-pro/"
