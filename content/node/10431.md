body: 'Greetings.  Those of you who produce OpenType fonts: how do you inform users
  about the available glyph substitutions? <BR> <BR>Is there a utility that will list
  and illustrate the substitutions that occur when the user chooses &#34;contextual
  alternates,&#34; &#34;stylistic alternates,&#34; etc.? <BR> <BR>-- Eric'

  body: A user can use the glyph palette in Illustrator &#40;CS and later&#41; and
    InDesign to see which glyphs are accessed from each specific feature. <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t know of any other currently-available end-user-friendly utility for
    doing this, although I&#39;m sure it would be welcomed by end users. <BR> <BR>However,
    I also suggest checking back in a couple of weeks. <BR> <BR>T

  body: I list and briefly explain the OT features in the manual that comes with my
    font for classicists, Biblical scholars, and medievalists. <BR> <BR>I also have
    prepared two documents, one in Indesign and one in Mellel, that can be downloaded
    from my web site.  The test files contain samples of regular text to which users
    can apply the relevant features and see the results, and there are specific instructions
    for how to apply each feature. <BR> <BR>David Perry
