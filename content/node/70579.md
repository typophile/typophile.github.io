body: "Trying to get ideas of what to do to with these - I have a maybe a 100 or so
  songs/poetry that I maybe want to put into a book. Found a trunk of them at my mom's
  house. They used to belong to my dad. He's been gone now 17 years. All are of the
  mostly folk or gospel type genre. Much are like Woody Guthrie songs.\r\n\r\nNeed
  some ideas what to do with them, what form I should put them in, or even what fonts
  to use. Maybe a song book? poetry book? memory book? Maybe a hardbound book or a
  collection of mini books? Whatever form I put them in, I'd like to be able to give
  copies to family, but I'm not even sure what format to use.  Any thoughts or suggestions
  or know of anything similar existing? Not sure if it's something to publish/copyright
  or not.  I work at a commercial printer, so I can do almost anything with them.\r\n\r\nI
  find my thoughts are still awfully clouded when I think of what to do with these.
  It's still deeply personal.  In there current form, many are on scraps of paper,
  notepads and even on kraft paper bag paper."

  body: "Many years ago, I did a similar project, gathering thoughts from different
    sources and compiling an anthology. On each two-page spread, the recto contained
    a scan of the original document, and the verso was typeset (especially helpful
    in the case of bad handwriting in the original).\r\n\r\nThe end-product was a
    one-off presentation copy, and the budget was non-existent, so I printed the final
    project on an good-quality inkjet printer, and sleeved the pages and put them
    in a three-ring binder. If you have a DocuPress (or something similar) at your
    disposal, you could probably put together a saddle-stitched, perfect-bound or
    Wire-O-bound book in much the same way."

  body: "Looking thru the Warhol book gives me the idea that I could incorporate old
    pics of dad. Maybe I could incorporate a picture of the trunk too - Might be interesting
    for a cover photo.  I very much like the Idea of doing a spread with a scan of
    the original on left with a typeset version on the right hand page. \r\n\r\nHmm...
    Don't have a DocuPresss, but I have a Indigo digital press and have a job we regularly
    print on kraft paper with. I could probably incorporate the kraft paper on some
    pages. I like the idea of having a bit of art flair. Maybe I need to go to bookstore
    and look at some art books."

  body: "I've done this before, I'd say personally that printing them out seperately
    and boxing them all together could give you the best results - it would mean you
    could go to town on different materials for each, fitting them in with the poem
    or song, and retaining the feel of the form you have them in. Keeping them very
    personal, I suppose. It would mean you wouldn't have to worry as much about dropping
    pages with different finishes into a booklet, and you could use different techniques
    to create something very beatiful. Maybe a little more work, but if you were to
    produce enough to give out to your family and some friends etc. Then see what
    the response is to it (if that was your plan, to see about publishing them). A
