body: "Hi. I'm looking for a font that I can use for a Buddhist Program in Taiwan.
  It will be used on a web site in body and headline sizes. I want something that
  is historically founded, but doesn't feel like an old dusty textbook. I'm looking
  for something contemporary but I don't want it to look like a trendy asian fusion
  restaurant or a spa.\r\n\r\nI was thinking Scala or Whitney. Because they feel intelligent,
  precise, cultured and modern (?). \r\nI would also like to find a typeface with
  a caligraphic influence but an terrified of it looking like an 'east meets west'
  cliche.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your help. thank you.\r\n"
