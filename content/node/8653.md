body: Here&#39;s mine, &#40;below&#41; but I&#39;m wondering what others suggest or  <BR>use
  regularly. I think I&#39;d rather have an &#39;ugly&#39; rag than a string of  <BR>hyphens.
  But I want to see what others prefer. <BR> <BR>By the way, is there a global setting
  for hyphenation in InDesign?  <BR>So far, I&#39;m forced to do this manually for
  each document. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/62966.gif"

  body: Joe, in some industries you don&#39;t have a choice. The banking industry
    for one, doesn&#39;t allow hypenation of any kind. As for my taste I like hypenation
    as long as its in InDesign and i can hang the hypens. I thought the informal rule
    was never more than 3 hypens in a row. <BR> <BR>On a simular thought do you know
    about the on-line InDesign magazine being published through Creative Pro. Those
    writers would have a better perspective of the &#34;rules&#34;. You can get a
    free copy at Creative Pro.

  body: Joe, as far as I can tell &#40;from deduction using InD and reviewing the
    way the manual reads&#41;, hyphenation is a paragraph level kind of setting unless
    you alter the hyphenation and spelling dictionary preferences. <BR> <BR>Help &#62;

  body: 'Hi Joe, <BR> <BR>Re. your &#34;global setting&#34;: <BR>1.Fire up InDesign
    and  <BR>2. Don&#39;t have ANY documents open,  <BR>3. then enter your type specifications
    &#40;like style, optical kerning, color, and H&amp;J settings&#41; in the Character
    and Paragraph palettes. These settings become the defaults for any future documents
    you create. <BR> <BR>My initial settings for the Hyphenation slider are: <BR>Words
    longer than: 6 <BR>After first: 3 <BR>Before last: 3 <BR>Hyphen limit: 3 &#40;when
    I&#39;m setting justified text, that is&#41; <BR>The Hyphenation Zone slider:
    I bump it 2 notches to the left &#40;of center&#41; towards &#34;better spacing&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>For ragged text, I try to use no hyphens &#40;or as few as possible&#41;.
    A main aim of using a ragged setting &#40;as I understand it&#41; is to maintain
    even spacing.  <BR> <BR>all the best, <BR> <BR>Kaisa'
