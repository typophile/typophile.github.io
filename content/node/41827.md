body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nOne of the students that works in my office asked for my help
  putting a certificate of appreciation together, and I wanted to get some good typophile
  input first. I've seen plenty of such certificates, but none that were actually
  thoughtfully put together.\r\n\r\nSo what kind of typography is appropriate for
  such a certificate?\r\n\r\nThanks for any thoughts on the matter.\r\n\r\n-Casey"

    this I used Canada Type's beautiful Bouwsma Text regular and Italic. The name
    is CT Mayfair. Since the name was so plain, I wanted something swashy.\r\n\r\nI
    made the frame with the Illustrator frames app.\r\n"
