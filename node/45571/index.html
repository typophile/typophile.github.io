  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is something I&rsquo;ve been playing around with for a few days. After my last script font Olicana was so well received I started thinking about a calligraphically influenced serif - something with plenty of movement. What are your thoughts of it so far? Maybe I&rsquo;ll do an infant &lsquo;a&rsquo; to go with the alternate &lsquo;g&rsquo; for a different stylistic variation.</p>
<p>Is it worth pursuing this? I have no idea if something like this exists already - does it? and is this different enough?</p>
<p>This is the Extra Black style, I&rsquo;ve also done some Light glyphs. There will probably be 6 weights (if the response is fairly positive, otherwise I&rsquo;ll abandon it and come back to it when I&rsquo;ve finished all my other half-finished projects).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like it a lot. The serifs seem like an odd mixture at times, but I think both styles can plausibly work together. In the &ldquo;p'  the mixture seems nice. I like the more structured looking 2 story g best. Also I think the single story g and 2 story a have a more cartoony look that make them stand out too much. I would imagine a solution for the a is not so simple in the bold weight. Overall though, I think its a very rich looking font. Great work!</p>

<p>For me, some of the joins are a bit painfully thin. This is especially true for the bowl of the a. Compare the join of the top of the p and of the r. To me the r is good and the p too thin.</p>
<p>Also given the rounded tops of the head serifs, it would seem to call for cupped foot serifs.</p>
<p>But overall the curves are very sweet, and this would be a very warm and attractive display face.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the feedback so far. OK, so now I&rsquo;ve done a few more characters - and you can see it in 6 weights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concentrating on the one &lsquo;g&rsquo; at the moment, but will include the other as an extra alternate glyph.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thickened the thin strokes, made the ear of the &lsquo;g&rsquo; a bit more beefy and shortened the crossbar on the &rsquo;t' to lessen the space between it and the following character. I also shortened the serifs on the &lsquo;y&rsquo; for the same reason, but that isn&rsquo;t shown here.</p>

<p>The horizontal stroke of the tail in the boldest weight has the flavor, but the lights are too regular. In general I think the light weights need more faceting in the round letters (o, e, g etc) to match the other letters (m,n,h,b,d,p&hellip;). I don&rsquo;t think contrast is the issue as William suggests. Get kinky with it!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Nick,
Great work, its looking really nice. I especially like the e, c and o. They have a really nice feeling cut. I also like the double story g, the y, the r and the f - although I find the g to be a little upright. I love the hard angled internal serif on the s - but maybe it needs to be accentuated further. Not a big fan of the serif on the top of the s.</p>
<p>To me the glyphs I&rsquo;ve listed above seem to fit into a more harder chiseled face, which seems a little bit at odds with the other softer more hand-drawn characteristics. EG, the ear on the g, the underside of the e, the hard internal bowl of the o all work together, but don&rsquo;t really fit with the more fluid calligraphic style of the h, m, n, b, t, i, v. BTW, I love the variation in weights - its nice to see the skeleton underneath still holds up at light weights.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks everybody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been refining away for the past few days, and now I&rsquo;ve done the complete lower case. I decided that the light weight was a bit too anorexic to get any decent bumps so I fattened it up. The heaviest weight is also a fair bit heavier, and looking pretty damn chunky!</p>
<p>This has been quite a learning process - there&rsquo;s a very fine line between good-looking curves with a few bumps and a bumpy mess. Some characters are more angular than the previous examples - c, e g (slightly) and s, and others have been made more substantial - a, the ear on the g (BTW - I like the top of the s, so I&rsquo;ll leave it). William - try rounding the tops of the foot serifs to match the pattern of the head serifs - What? like Cheltenham you mean? I&rsquo;m not keen on that idea - I like the contrast between the top and bottom serifs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty pleased with it so far - it has plenty of character but can be taken seriously, without straying into the &lsquo;cartoony&rsquo; look.</p>
<p>Any glaring errors I&rsquo;ve missed?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I like the u as it is - it&rsquo;s not too wide, and the top serifs are OK - they fit in with k, v, w, x and y and add to the overall rhythm.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Nick</p>
<p>Very nice design, I bet you could be even harder on the shape of the lc g, it still looks &lsquo;a tad&rsquo; soft compared to the other letters.</p>
<p>Are you looking at this as a text design for use below 14pt? Some years ago I remember doing some work on a font with a similar shape lc u (flat top serifs) and it made some word shapes look a bit awkward in small sizes. I&rsquo;ll try and find some more detail of what it was.</p>

<p>Now the heaviest weight is UltraBlack. I&rsquo;ve also altered the lower case s and u. There&rsquo;s almost a touch of Blackletter about this typeface, although it&rsquo;s not too Teutonic looking. Besides I think I&rsquo;m too late to jump on that Blackletter bandwagon, it has already driven past.</p>
