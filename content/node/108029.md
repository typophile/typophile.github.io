body: I've been using my registered version for about half a month. It worked perfectly
  well, until today, it suddenly becomes UNREGISTERED. I tried to enter my registration
  code over and over and always got the message "Activation failed". Tried to re-install
  then re-activate and still failed. What's the matter?
