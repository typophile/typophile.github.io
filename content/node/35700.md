body: "HI,\r\n\r\nI have developed a font. When I tested it under MS Windows environment
  (MS office), I examined that most of the fonts get gray scaled at point size 12
  but not the one that I developed. Is it possible to add information inside font
  to force it to be Gray scaled at a particular defined point size? \r\n\r\nNote:
  Standard option (not ClearType)is selected for smooth edge and screen fonts. \r\n\r\nBest
  regards,\r\nAtif\r\n  "

  body: "By gray scaling do you mean antialiasing?  Or the gray-bar that InDesign
    and Illustrator do?  (I dunno if MS Office does that too).  Or are you wanting
    it to be antialiased at a smaller point size?\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una

  body: "Yes, you are right, when I said gray scaling I mean antialiasing or smoothing.
    Would you please tell me; Is it possible to add information inside font to force
    it to be always antialiased at a particular defined point size? through hinting
    or by some other means. \r\n\r\nthanks and regards,\r\nAtif"

  body: The PPM ranges at which a TrueType font is antialiased are located in the
    GASP table. In FontLab, you can set the ranges in the Font Info panel under TrueType
    Settings -> Font Smoothing. Fontographer should have something similar. There's
    also a Windows command line app called <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/8162/">TTFGASP</a>
    that will add a GASP table to a TrueType font.
