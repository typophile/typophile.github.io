body: "These 2 menus appeared circa 1946 purporting to have been made in 1834. I have
  identified the typeface of \"494 Pearl Street\" and the \"greater than\" and \"lesser
  than\" symbols at the end of the word \"DELMONICO\" as being Kitcat patented April
  10, 1883 (already a clue that these menus are frauds). \r\n\r\nHowever, after searching
  Caslon, Garamond, Ionic, Cheltenham, and other fonts, I cannot identify the other
  typefaces used in these menus. I suspect they were commonly around in a print shop,
  and were chosen because they looked \"old.\"\r\n\r\nI also suspect that the \u201CDELMONICO\u201D
  name was composed of different fonts. The \u201CM\u201D in each menu is different.
  The \u201CN\u201D is pointed and goes below the line. The \u201CO\u201D is also
  different in each menu. The \u201C1834\u201D looks to me like it was supposed to
  be a woodcut, but I have no idea. I cannot locate a font with those numerals.\r\n\r\nI
  am a complete neophyte in the area of font identification. This research is for
  an academic talk dealing with culinary history.\r\n\r\nI have linked to the images
  because they are large. You can click on them to enlarge them even more. These are
  photocopies I have from archives, so the quality is not that great. Apologies in
  advance.\r\n\r\nAny assistance would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\n<P><A HREF=\"http://www.windycitybooks.com/menu/amermenuco.jpg\">

  body: "I'm afraid you are outside the time frame that most of us have any information
    for. 'Menu1' looks largely hand-lettered to me, and Menu 2 is the only one that
    says (to me) that it was made in 1834. I think the 1834 in Menu 1 may just be
    the date that Delmonicos was established. You know how businesses like to tell
    how how long they have been around.\r\n\r\nThe small lettering on Menu2 is interesting
    because it is so beat up and misshapen. I notice that a 'g' was used for an 'a'
    in 'Sausages' or I would have suggested that the small lettering was hand-printed
    too. Maybe it says the printer (Smith & Handford) used really old, beat up, overused
    type, which seems plausible.\r\n\r\nSome of the larger lettering may have been
    wood type. You said you identified the PEARL STREET type. Can you tell us what
    it was?\r\n\r\nThere must be books about early 19th Century printing in America,
    but I sure don't have any of them, so I guess that's all I can contribute. Sorry.\r\n\r\n-

    body: "The typeface used to print \"494 Pearl Street\" and the little doo-dads
      at the end of Menu 2's \"Delmonico's\" is MacKellar, Smiths and Jordan's \"Kitcat\"
      series font, patented April 10, 1883, US patent #13, 849. I am sitting here
      with 3 books on typefaces: Encyclopedia of Type Faces, Printing Types, and the
      1896 American Type Founders Co. sample book. My eyes are crossing. \r\n\r\nThe
      type fonts were not handprinted, nor were they hand-run. These menus were \"mocked
      up\" circa 1946. They were given out all over the East coast as \"marketing\"
      thingies but the menus over time were separated from the \"postcards\" that
      came with them, and Menu 2 has attained the status as a \"real\" menu from 1834.\r\n\r\nThe
      type faces in both are similar BUT not identical. For example, in Menu 1, the
      \"Regular Dinner\" looks like ATF Garamond, while in Menu 2, it resembles Linotype
      Old Style Regular. In Menu 1, the \"RESTAURANT\" looks like ATF Bodoni, while
      in Menu 2, it looks like ATF Garamond Roman. These are just fairly reasonable
      guess on my part because I don't know beans about type faces - just what I'm
      seeing in books. \r\n\r\nAm desperately trying to identify the numerals that
      compose \"1834.\" The \"3\" looks like a medical number in the ATF book, but
      I cannot locate a type face for these with certainty.\r\n\r\nThanks again for
      trying to help. I truly appreciate it!"
