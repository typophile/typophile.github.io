  to display all characters. Notice the ZOE: TFOM Fonts characters I and J have serifs.\r\n\r\n(Copy
  from the ZOE The Fist of Mars: Font Editing thread in GBAtemp, GBA - Game Development,
  ROM Hacking and Translatio. This subforum on GBAtemp exceeds the character limit
  so the correct title is GBA - Game Development, ROM Hacking and Translations.)\r\n\r\nYou
  want to translate ZOE: TFOM into Turkish.\r\nThe only Turkish characters in the
  ROM are \xE2 \xE7 \xEE \xF6 \xFB \xFC so you want things like \u011F \u0131 \u015F.\r\nAnybody
  wants to edit its typeface."
