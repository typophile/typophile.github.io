body: Hey all, I&#39;m new here. I don&#39;t really have any good reason that I need
  this ID&#39;ed, but I saw it a lot while watching the NCAA basketball tournament
  and it got me curious. =&#41; You guys seem pretty good at ID&#39;ing type, so I
  thought I&#39;d post it here. <BR> <BR>I think the face has been in use by CBS Sports
  since at least the mid-1980s, so it has to be from before then. Might be a custom
  job, too -- I don&#39;t know. The large &#34;S&#34; in &#34;SPORTS&#34; seems to
  have different proportions, so maybe that was done custom and the rest is a typeface?
  <BR> <BR>The only thing I&#39;ve been able to find that comes close is a cheap-looking
  face called &#34;AquaticHeavy&#34;, with a copyright listed by &#34;NovelFonts&#34;
  &#40;1994&#41;, that&#39;s undoubtedly a ripoff of some other face. &#34;Aquatic&#34;
  has the right kind of semiserifs, but the curves are wrong. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance!

  body: Yeah, it probably is custom... oh well, it was worth a try. Thanks, Yves.

    called <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=203113" target="_blank">Aquarius</a>.

  body: Aha -- thanks, Mark! <BR> <BR>AGFA lists this as &#34;Aquarius No. 8&#34;
    -- were there others in the Aquarius series? Have they been digitized? <BR>
