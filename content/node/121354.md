    year was your sample printed (even a general decade would help), and is a better
    sample available?"

    different from all others, even counting ink spread, bad printing and worse reproduction.'

  body: "In view of the atrocious quality of most of the images I do not see a major
    inconsistency with Benton Modern Display Regular [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BentonModernDisplayRegNumbers_5881.gif]\r\nor
    SemiBold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BentonModernDisplaySemiBoldNumbers_6101.gif]\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/benton-modern-display/\r\nparticularly
    if the font is compressed a little.\r\nCentury is also a possibility, but the
    terminals seem to have a more sharply defined ball than either the images or Benton
    Modern Display.\r\nDon"

    fonts, does not match 5.\r\nUnfortunately I also need the numbers that are not
    listed in the examples."

  body: "Originally designed in 1894 by Linn Boyd Benton, Century had countless of
    versions and variations for every type of print technology (starting with Century
    Expanded by Morris Fuller Benton) and that not counting the ones with different
    names (like Benton Modern cited by Don). They differing in details like sharpness
    of serifs (Century expanded) or shape of part of numbers (Century Old Style),
    and hoping that someone at some point digitised the exact same cut (optical size
    and all) used for these pre-digital numbers is a leap of faith. Finding it, based
    on such a poor sample is very unlikely.\r\nAnyway, here are the numerals of all
    the typefaces named Century on the biggest font retailer there is: http://myfonts.us/td-D4K6rB"
