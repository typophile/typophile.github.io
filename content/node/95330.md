    a year.

    perhaps that's not a supp at all(?) I'm looking forward to your insightful stuffs
    :)\r\n\r\n@Joshua Langman, thanks for the info. Since we're now in Aug. '12 in
    the next four months we'll see something awesome hot off the press. Hopefully
    there's a poster to tac up on the wall ...maybe there's still some time for me
    to submit something typotastic ;)  \r\n\r\n\r\nn.  "

  body: Not a supplement, per se. 'Fonts in Focus' is a Linotype occasional publication,
    which I presume was bundled with Codex as a form of publicity.
