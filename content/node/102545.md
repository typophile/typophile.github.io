  on a type poster about the differences and similarities of Akzidenz Grotesque and
  Helvetica (I know, not the most original choice). I've browsed through all of my
  type books and what feels like the whole Internet, and I found a few good article
  of Helvetica vs. Univers, but the info on Akzindenz is rather shallow and nothing
  I didn't know from before (Directly influenced, horizontally cut strokes and taller
  x-height). \r\n\r\nI guess what I'm asking is if someone has some interesting information
  or can point me in the direction of articles that can help make my poster at least
  a little bit more interesting that the 1000s other out there.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nErik"

    about AG, you should have enough information to work with. What are you still
    looking for if you know all the differences and similarities?

    most recent versions of AG, at different sizes, that Helvetica was copied from.\r\nSome
    sizes are more like Helvetica than others.\r\nHere\u2019s a sample from it:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/berthold_accidenz_4420.jpg]"

    was reworked after the success of Helvetica in 1957 to look more regular/similar.
    The old version was still available as AG Old Style, the new version as AG Serie
    57. Here are some images http://www.flickr.com/photos/kupfers/tags/akzidenzgrotesk/"

    why do it? \r\n\r\nFor a different take on Helvetica lookalikes, maybe compare
    something to Schwartz's Neue Haas Grotesk?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/nhg/"

    how the terminals of /e change with size."
