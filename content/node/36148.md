  2005\r\n\r\nContrary to [[FF Dax]], FF Daxline has optically equal weights -- thus
  being a real grotesque face without abandoning the character of Dax. The aim with
  this variation was to balance the contrast so that it works well in long texts with
  small point sizes. Daxline is much wider than Dax, and the capitals are larger.
  There is even a lighter version than Light: Thin.\r\n\r\n<strong>External Links</strong>\r\n<a
