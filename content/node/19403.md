    problem these days in the forum): \r\n\r\nSahara Bodoni seems to be quite popular
    now: \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/sahara-bodoni/sahara-bodoni/\r\n\r\nHave
    a look at Craw Modern:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/craw-modern/urw-t-bold/\r\n\r\nand
    also don't forget to check Didoni URW:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/didoni/urw-d-normal/\r\n\r\nMaybe
    that helps. "
