body: This is an interesting one. He is a super guy, probably the most courteous and
  reliable client I have had thus far. &#40;Y&#39;know, the ones you will bend over
  backwards for&#41;. He has an earthmoving business, and wants to look professional,
  honest and reliable, with a view to engage with bigger professional contracts .
  He also wants to reflect his Christian belief in the logotype. I have come to the
  conclusion below. I think it works on two levels, the cross motif can suggest both
  the crucifix and shovels, both of which are particulary pertinent. Have at it! <BR>

    got to that part of your description, so, hey, I guess that works perfectly!

    what&#39;s the <i>dagger</i> connection?  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>The only thing I would
    say here is that the second word seems to need to be a lot heavier; or maybe all-caps,
    especially condensed. Mason Stencil, anyone? &#40;That was only semi-serious.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;d remove the trapping from Caecilia, and correct the microscopic
    slant, which can only give you rasterization headaches. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: It looks nice, but this is a lot to read, considering the quickly viewed applications
    that are used in this industry &#40;vehicles, signage, etc.&#41;. Nelson Earthworks,
    isn&#39;t too long in itself, but your execution with two different type approaches,
    one of them being a stencil &#40;which is a busy stop&#39;n&#39;go face&#41;,
    and the triple-meaning crucifix/shovels/r-t ligature make for a boat load to take
    in. I suggest finding a way to simplify it. I think I might even like it better
    if it was all the same face, but only the &#34;r&#34; was stencil to accomodate
    the r-t lig. The only issue I would have with that is that I don&#39;t really
    see the shovels. As Hrant commented, &#34;dagger&#34; comes to mind, or even when
    I think in construction terms, I see a file, screwdriver, brush, etc...but not
    shovels. Overall, the concept behind the symbol is pretty clever...you&#39;ve
    accomplished your client&#39;s objective, but kept it subtle enough to appeal
    to all audiences. <BR> <BR>Good work! <BR> <BR>Aloha, <BR>Scott

  body: Kris, I like the tone and quality of what you&#39;re doing, but as a whole,
    I&#39;m not sold yet. <BR> <BR>I have to admit that the stencil treatment is making
    it very busy on my eyes. And the ligature between the r and t isn&#39;t helping
    me read the shovels any easier. I want to see them, but I just don&#39;t. <BR>
    <BR>Keep it up. As always, nice work.

  body: Uh-oh, we have the pre-commitment jitters! He now sees it as blasphemous,
    with the cross/shovel duality. Oh well. I had never inteded the &#39;shovels&#39;
    intitallly, someone at the office mentioned it and it stuck, as things are wont
    to do. <BR> <BR>Here it is, non-stencil. Bland I reckon, but what do you think?

    It reads more easily, and is a bit more human. I find that the &#39;spade&#39;
    reference has all but disappeared. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52203.gif"

  body: For me the ambiguity with the spade/dagger/cross just gives too many different
    messages, and weakens the mark.  <BR> <BR>I like your stencilized Oranda, which
    conveys both rough strength and sophistication - already a lot. The simple word
    mark may be better.

  body: Also, you could have a cross on the stationary and cards with the personal
    names - perhaps with the distinctive spade/cross logo. The religous/commercial
    business juxtaposition seems to me in poor taste, whereas a personal/religious
    one seems appropriate.

  body: Kris, why is the second r in Earthworks lacking stencilization &#40;if I may
    use that word&#41;? It catches my eye because of that.

  body: I like the brick red. It somehow makes the cross/dagger/spade thing not somber
    but playful, and has a totally different mood than earlier. Also the bleached
    out artsy contrasting background. Very nice!

  body: Cheers mate! They aren&#39;t quite the true colours, foe those who are familiar
    with the Riso inks they are Marine Red and tints of Hunter green. I wasn&#39;t
    trying for sombre, but I always start in blackand white, then move to colour.

    been an interesting read. The religion thing must have been quite an interesting
    experience. I like the tiling effect on the business card. Could be a &#34;collect
    &#39;em all&#34; challenge?. Heh. <BR> <BR>It appears that the card could do with
    a little more leading between the name/title and the contact details. The space
    between the email and fax number is greater than that which is between the name/mobile
    number. <BR> <BR>There seems to be some sort of slight optical alingment issue
    thing going on with the M F E.  <BR> <BR>- Chris'
