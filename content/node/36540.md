body: "Damariscotta is basically a text font with embellished capital letters which
  can stand on their own for decorative titles, or used with the lower case letters
  for text or titles.  It's got a certain panache, reminiscent of both decorative
  Victorian or Art Nouveau lettering like some of those found in our <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/anfonts\">Art
  Nouveau</a> package, unexpectedly combined with some characteristics of Celtic lettering
  like the more decorative Gaelic fonts in our <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/artype/celtic\">Celtic</a>
  package.  I named it Damariscotta after a region in Maine which attracted a lot
  of Scottish settlers in the 18th century. You can see a sample or get the demo version
  to try out at <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com\">www.fontcraft.com</a>.\r\n\r\nBTW,
  I'm new to writing on this site, but it seems bizarre not to be able to include
  images in posts o a site about graphic design.\r\n\r\nDave"
