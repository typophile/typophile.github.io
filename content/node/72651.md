body: I need to do a school presentation about a font. I choose Futura for its elegant
  curves, doing all possible research I can, on the web. Is there anything interesting
  about the "Futura" font to share, other than Ikea controversy? I am trying to work
  on a slideshow.  Any information will help! Thanks!
