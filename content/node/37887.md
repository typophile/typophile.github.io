body: "I've been using Gill Sans ultra bold lately.\r\nI admire its peculiar aspect,
  founding it very legible in spite of its extraordinary weight. I am pretty sure
  Eric Gill took great fun in drawing some letters\u2026 do you agree?\r\nI noticed
  a curious thing: the exclamation mark is made of a single form, the stem actually
  touching the dot.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gill-Sans-Std-Ultra-Bold_5231.gif]\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone in mind other fonts in which the exclamation mark is made of a single shape?
  I'm very curious about this."

  body: Gill Sans ultra bold is indeed an odd bird, very unlike its family members
    in many ways. I can't think of other fonts that have the connected exclamation
    mark as this one does, but I'm sure something exists, or if it doesn't it soon
    will since you brought attention to it.

  body: It's really a rare phenomenon, and i think most designers try to avoid a one-contour
    form, but Rudolf Koch's Neuland (Linotype) has it too...
