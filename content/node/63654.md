body: "I have been wondering lately where the terminology used to describe components
  of characters' shapes derives from. In particular, I'm wondering if there is a single
  set of terms that can be used to describe characters in different scripts using
  similar terms so we can understand clearly what is being talked about from one script
  to another. I know for example that the equivalent of \"eye\" \u2014 often used
  to describe the closed counter in <e> \u2014 is used to describe the counters inside
  the Perso-Arabic haa' (or heh): Urdu uses this name for a letter called \"two-eyed
  heh\" (do-cheshmi he). I've seen a review article of Devanagari terminology that
  seems to conclude there is not much standardisation apart from \"shirorekha\" (the
  long head stroke above Devanagari letters), \"kana\" (the vertical stem on most
  letters) or (in English \u2014 I forgot the Hindi/Sanskrit term) \"box loops\",
  the filled-in, boxy, serif-like junctions in the Devanagari or Gujarati consonant
  letters equivalent to R, M or Bh. Then there are the Chinese and Japanese terms
  for different stroke types and for the serifs in Song/Mincho typefaces (\"fish scales\"
  in Japanese). \r\n\r\nThis is the extent of what I'm aware of. I'm wondering if
  there exists anywhere a set of standardised terms that would unambiguously describe
  character shape components across any variety of scripts, however varied they may
  be, whether Latin-Greek-Cyrillic, Arabic, Sinoform or other kinds of scripts. \r\n\r\nThe
  reason I'm asking this question is because I am doing research on the origins of
  some old vernacular scripts of Indonesia and the Philippines that seem to have their
  origin in Old Gujarati script, and I'm trying to find a set of terms that will succinctly
  describe what aspect of a character's form I am referring to, whether it's in the
  original Gujarati or Devanagari shape, or the new shapes the characters evolved
  into in the island scripts. \"Bowl\" and \"arch\" seem intuitive enough for upward-
  and downward concave strokes, respectively, but I'm at a loss for terms to describe
  left- or right-concave strokes. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a source \u2014 it could
  be a book or a web site \u2014 that has a fairly exhaustive list of terms for character
  components along with clear definitions (as opposed to just giving ambiguous illustrations)
  for terms, especially ones whose intended meaning I have yet to clearly understand
  like \"transitive\" and \"reflexive\"? And in particular, a source that describes
  these components in script-neutral terms that could be used for different scripts
  in use around the world?"
