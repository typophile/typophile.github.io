    It is shown in the book with a lower case, and it seems to match your type exactly.\r\n\r\n-

    very possible that there have been copies of it made by various foundries on both
    sides of the Atlantic. There were several U.S. foundries with versions of it,
    why not some German ones as well?\r\n\r\nAgfa had a digital version of the PhotoLettering

  body: "They are definitely related to each other. In fact a few of them are practically
    identical. My understanding is that it was a common practice for metal type founders
    to imitate popular designs of other foundries, often re-naming the copies. Unfortunately
    my library is not complete enough to pin down the true origin of this condensed
    Latin typeface, but my inclination is to believe Jaspert's \"Encyclopaedia of
    Type Faces\" that the Stephenson Blake foundry in England was the original source
    of both the German and American typefaces, even though no year was specified as
    the origination date.\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone else here, like Mark Simonson, who
    has a good historical library might be able to shed more light on this. I will
    look in a few other books I have to see if anything shows up. The closest digital
    version is [[http://www.linotype.com/157464/pllatinelongated-font.html|PL Latin
    Elongated]], which Linotype states was designed in 1988 by David Quay for Photo
    Lettering Inc. But we know that it was based on a much older typeface.\r\n\r\n\r\n-

  body: "First of all, I think Mike is right \u2013 Latin elongated is the original
    design. But at that time \u2013 late 1800's \u2013 \"piracy\" was most common
    and a lot of foundries produced commercial highly successful type cuts shamelessly
    under a new name - as Cristobal has pointed out for this specific case. \r\n\r\nAbout
    the names of types ... in my observation from the mid 1850s till about 1910 a
    lot of foundries tended to organize their products in a kind of families vs the
    earlier generic denomination. \r\n\r\nSo in the specimen I cited, there is the
    \"Schmale Renaissance\" but also a \"Fette Renaissance\", \"Renaissance Versalien\"
    and \"Renaissance Zierschriften\", wich all show different cuts but all have one
    common element \u2013 large, heavy triangular serifs. But very confusingly there
    is also a \"Breite Renaissance\" and a \"Renaissance-Italienne\" with more or
    less spiky serifes. And last there is a \"Skelett-Renaissance\" that shows none
    of the elements of the later known \"Skelett\" typefaces.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has
    interest in the above mentioned specimen, drop me a line and I will either send
    via email or post somewhere.\r\n\r\n"
