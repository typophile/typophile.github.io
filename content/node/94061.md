  course nothing is up yet, but I do have a plan :) And that plan to feature some
  font on some kind of product or whatever and talk about how awesome it is and hopefully
  who created it and when and why ... I'll be going off the beaten track to source
  out the goodness. It won't be your usual gab about an type designer doing whatever
  - font rageous is about coolio letter shapes and their function in life :)!!\r\n\r\nI'll
  let y'all know what's what when I get something up and going ...real soon! \r\n\r\nOh
  ya BTW, I'll be coming to some of you soon enough for a cozy one-on-one ... ya baby!!\r\n\r\nn."

  body: "Thanks! \r\n\r\nToday I just received long awaited permission to go in and
    photograph any and all CD and LP cover art over at a city wide music distribution
    chain of stores. It will be a great source of material I'm sure!  Earlier on I
    got permission to take snaps of book covers over at a city wide chain of stores
    which sell used books. Permission from grocery stores is next on my list.\r\n\r\nTypographic
    cover art of an early Clash LP will be up first ...I think ...maybe yes ...we'll
    see!!!\r\n\r\nn.  "

  body: "AFAIK there is only one typographic Clash cover:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/the_clash_clash_5923.jpg]\r\nNot
    as distinguished as most of their other covers.\r\nHowever, the genre of type-only
    album covers would be interesting.\r\nIncluding this, of course:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unknown_4012.jpeg]\r\nBut
    that raises an interesting question: it\u2019s tough to render \uFB02uorescents
    (although RGB helps!), but photography (rather than scans) can convey other qualities
    (e.g. embossing, foil, stock, die-cuts, distress &c.) \u2014 is that the direction
    you\u2019re headed? Certainly, the dimensionality of real books\u2026"

  body: "Thanks! \r\n\r\nNick , the plan is to capture letter shape beasties doing
    their thing within their natural environment ... for instance a jar of mayonnaise
    on the grocery shelf, and then talk a bit about those letter shapes ...and  hopefully
    some chat time with the designer of those letter shapes ...hopefully with someone
    like Mr. Brignall.\r\n\r\nThe music store was key because I think that those letter
    shapes are used on products that tap right into past and present culture, and
    to some extant so too do the letter shapes on products at a book store.  \r\n\r\nn."
