  We are suposed to research on the characteristics of the font selected and then
  apply it to the classification it comes under (here contemporary)..So it'd be great
  if you could help out...coz all I'm getting is links to download the font...\r\nThanks\r\nMerryn"

  body: "I wouldn't call Blur contemporary.\r\nThe Blur typeface was released in the
    early days of digital type, pre-internet. What, 15 years ago? Type culture was
    hugely different then.\r\n\r\nBlur derives from photographic processes NB used
    for making type in the early 1980s, in Face magazine. Remember, he was traditionally
    educated/trained at the London College of Prining. I could be wrong, but I believe
    the technique involved making a negative-film-to-positive-paper contact print
    -- but with a layer of clear acetate between -- which will throw the image out
    of focus. Interestingly, Photoshop filters can produce a similar effect. But I
    don't know what technique he used to make the digital outlines of the FontFonts."

      above but im pasting it.. \"Brody\u2019s first digital typeface, Blur, is one
      of the first examples of a new language emerging from the Mac. An analog-digital
      collision, Blur is inherently soft-edged; at the time, other faces with soft
      edges were created by shooting traditional typeface deliberately out of focus.\"
      ...I read that Blur is usually categorised as \"amorphous typeface\" ...could
      you explain how contemporary and amorphous typefaces differ?\r\ncheers\r\nMerryn"

    that another definitive face of early DTP era was Industria -- originally created
    with pen. ink, and ruler. \r\n\r\nHowever, digitization did allow an outsider
    to get into the game, and NB was one of the founders of FontShop, which published
    Blur. (Although Industria came out early from Monotype I believe.)"

    monograph, so that would be a good starting point for your research. And yes,
    in the book it is called an \"analogue-digital collision\".  :-)\r\n\r\nNick,
    I believe that by \"amorphous\" they are referring to the difficulty of categorizing
    a typeface such as Blur... not to its being readable or not. The FontShop catalog
    has a whole section called Amorphous, for fonts with wacky shapes that defy traditional
    categories like Serif or Sans Serif."

  body: "First of all I'd say that Blur is a display typeface. Display typefaces tend
    to follow trends and fashion and may be contemporary in their time but grow old
    fast.\r\nBrody initiated the Fuse series of experimental typefaces around the
    same time as Blur came out. That would be the other category I'd think of. Fuse
    was a platform for type designers to question the relation between form and funcion
    of type and to experiment with what type could communicate other than the text
    it displayed."

    body: Blur was published in 1994 and EVERYBODY used it to look up to date like
      with the earlier typefaces Brody did. It wore out pretty fast. I can't remember
      anything remarkable using that typeface other than Brody's posters. Any logo
      with a wordmark set in Blur would have said "Blur" instead of what it was supposed
      to say. I consider Blur more to be an idea published as a typeface than a typeface
      being designed to serve a certain purpose. This would probably describe Brody's
      philosophy as well. Look at amazon for "The Graphic Language of Neville Brody
      2". The title uses Blur.

    body: "Like Blur being a blurred Helvetica (or similar)?\r\nWhy?\r\nWell, we are
      talking experimental typography here.\r\nExperiments are done to see what happens
      (if I do this or that) and to come to unexpected results. It's about breaking
      rules and overcoming tradition.\r\nIn the case of Blur Brody wanted the look
      of the typeface to show the process of its technical production (like woodcut
      type does). The typeface was supposed to have a human touch this way. It says
      all this in the book. As I said, there's an idea behind the whole thing. There
      has been a lot of experimenting with type back then - like combining Futura
      and Bodoni in a font called Fudoni for example. It's tweaking known typefaces
      but with a different idea."

      small sizes it's gonna be used for headlines (display).\r\n\r\nThe designers
      chooses a typeface depending on the project (client's briefing, content, context)
      and/or his personal taste. Period.\r\n\r\nI think my favourite example for choice
      of typeface is David Carson setting an article about Brian Ferry in Zapf Dingbats
