  body: '26016 &#40;dark red one with the quotation marks&#41;, god I&#39;d love to
    give that to some of my pupils. Not very International, though :-D <BR> <BR>26009,
    the red hypnopaedia shirt, is also very nice.  <BR> <BR>26006 is also great but
    the colour scheme is sucky.  <BR> <BR>Naw, 16 is fun... I&#39;d vote for that. '

  body: <i>&#62; Not very International, though</i> <BR> <BR>Damnit you&#39;re right
    HD, I hadn&#39;t thought of that&#42;! It  <BR>needs guillemets for France, inverted
    quotation marks  <BR>for German etc. etc. Can&#39;t it be printed with a holographic
    <BR>print? Then you can adjust the angle at which you walk  <BR>depending on which
    country you are in, in order to have  <BR>the proper glyphs visible... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    <BR> <BR>&#42;No no no I didn&#39;t design it don&#39;t misunderstand me.
