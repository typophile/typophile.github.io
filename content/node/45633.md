body: This is one of two posters I made for my Language Arts teacher who is leaving
  our school at the end of this year. He's a big guy with a beard who wears glasses
  and is very into typography and writing. He is one of my favorite teachers so I
  made this for him, I'm screen printing it this weekend and presenting it to him
  at graduation, as always feedback is greatly appreciated[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture2_4036.png]
