  thread it looked more like a separate font. \r\nSo I made it into it's own font
  (borrowing some characters from Gidole) and would love some feedback.\r\n\r\nMore

  body: "The bowl of /p and, to a lesser degree, /q, looks like it's leaning backwards.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not convinced of the flattish bottoms of /b /d.\r\n\r\nThe /m and /w look somewhat
    asymmetric; I think the apex of the second arch in /m and first arch in /w might
    not be centered. Maybe even the two arches are of different widths?\r\n\r\nThe
    /f and /t still strike me as too narrow."

  body: "Hi, thanks for the great feedback again \r\n\r\nI wasn't happy with p,q,d,b
    either but they are difficult to master because it should look somewhat symmetrical
    and effortless but still be balanced. It's especially difficult width g,p,q because
    I want to accentuate the corner were the stem is cut of but that causes them to
    lean a little bit so it's a matter of finding the right compromise.\r\n\r\nm+w
    were perfectly symmetrical (photoshop rendering isn't always 100% accurate) but
    now I've tried making the m asymmetrical (apex, not width).\r\n\r\nI've also made
    f+t a bit wider\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/gidolinya_6224.png"

  body: The joins of /g and similar ones are heavy; you should do an optical compensation.
    The /w is very flat compared to the /v, and I think it could use a nice angle.

  body: "Thank you for the feedback. The joins were already thinned but I think i
    thinned them even more in the latest version. \r\nProblem with /w is that my attempts
    on designing it like the /v has resulted in the /w being too wide.\r\n\r\nLatest
