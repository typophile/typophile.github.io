    do the Fontlab work, he might be much more productive. Hint to all!

  body: We once had to work on a design that used Creampuff. The font performed so
    poorly that we bought a license for Eclat and substituted it. The client nor the
    "designer" of the original piece ever noticed, and we felt <em>a lot</em> more
    comfortable.

  body: This subject seems to come up every few months, and certain people seem determined
    to beat a dead horse. Please have the courtesy to read the ENTIRE thread that
    Stephen posted first above. Yes, Creampuff is a rip; yes, it sucks as a font;
    yes, I apologize (again) for attempting to learn the craft of fontmaking from
    an acknowledged (and revered, it seems) master. <em>Enfin, pouvons-nous mettre
    ceci sujet au repos?</em>

    As to that matter, I think we could use slightly higher contrast for link colors
    or at least some more style differentiators (e.g., bg color, underline, or dotted/dashed
    underline) for links in body copy here on Typophile\r\n\r\n -t"

    used it many times myself to choose transfer type to spend fortunes on. The genre
    of lettering is related to old baseball team names but there were plenty of old
