  free to move it if it isn't. I specifically need a type 1 font which can be distributed
  and is royalty free. Do such things exist? I know OTF and TTF have these but I seem
  to be coming up short with this specific type. I work on the FOP project and need
  to validate the CharString data from the original against that of a subset which
  is the feature I'm adding.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows of any and where I can find one
  that would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    10 pitch. Google those with \"type 1 xorg\"  added and you'll see.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    There are many more if you do not need the right to modify the font file and distribute
    the modified font file."

    href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a> you will get 5447  font files
    with extension .pfb (in my installation of MacTeX, they are in /usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/fonts/type1).
