  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">A new version (3.0.1) of <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->DTL LetterModeller<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (LeMo) is available for (free) downloading:
– <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac OS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
– <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Windows<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMo_1_5601.jpg]
 
Part of the new functionality is the support for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->skeleton<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, i.e. heart line fonts. The construction of the Humanistic minuscule, of which the primary harmonic model (phm) for the minuscules is a stripped version, i.e. the superfluous elements are removed, is the result of canalization/formalization by the broad nib (determined by friction and preferred contrast-flow) of repetitive movements, which date back to the Romans (see the illustration of the Latin cursive alphabets as written with a pen by the Romans, taken from E. Maunde Thompson’s  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Introduction to Greek and Latin Palaeography<!-- raw HTML omitted --> [1912] below). The capitals however, find their origin in the heart line construction applied by the Greeks, which were adapted for writing with a flat brush by the Romans without significant changes in their construction. Hence the basis of these capitals can’t be formed by a model comparable with the phm.
 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMo_2_4629.jpg]
 
Heart line character descriptions for for instance the capitals or for the minuscules outside the phm, i.e. the ‘spectacle’ g, the s (the long s belongs to the phm) and the v–z range, can be added and combined with the phm. All parameters will be applied on the single-stroke definitions too. This ‘skeleton’ font has to be in the Ikarus format and (for the moment) the name is hard coded and should be ‘skeleton.ik’, otherwise the file will not be recognized. For the Windows version the skeleton font should be placed in the current working directory, i.e., where the program executable resides. On the Mac, the file is expected to reside in one of the application’s subdirectories, namely in &hellip;/phm.app/Contents/MacOS/.
 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMo_3_5493.jpg]
 
The skeleton font can contain all characters in the ASCII range (see also the ‘Read Me’ file). In case of an overlap with the characters that are constructed using the harmonic models, the characters in the skeleton font will supersede the ones in these. The height of the capitals is connected to the ascender height, i.e. when the length of the ascenders is changed, the height of the capitals will be changed accordingly. The basis for this relation, i.e. the starting point for the transformations, is defined by the relation between the capitals and the phm when applying a certain range of parameters. One way to define this relation is to reduce the pen width for both the phm and the capitals to a single line, i.e. a skeleton construction. This relation can for instance be like Claude Garamond applied, which is described in the illustration (for which the Adobe Garamond Premier was used) below.
 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMo_4_4394.jpg]
 
Skeleton fonts can be constructed using DTL IkarusMaster (light) or with any other font (Bezier) editor and subsequently converted by DTL IkarusMaster (light) to IK format. Because the construction of the serifs is related to that of the primary harmonic model, serifs cannot be added to the skeleton font using the applicable radio buttons. Exceptions to the parameters cannot be applied to the skeleton font either (for the moment).
 
The ‘Pen thickness’ parameter is supported now. ‘Auto spacing’ based on the rhythmic system (see also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this topic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) is automatically applied on the letters from the primary harmonic model. The secondary harmonic model is treated differently: the right side of the k, and the left and right sides of the v-z range, are just spaced ‘tightly’ (50 IK-units). The RSB/LSB values of the characters in the ‘skeleton.ik’ file are taken from this file. Pen width and angle have an influence on these side bearings as well.
 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMo_5_4562.jpg]
 
An outline editor, which makes glyph editing possible after exporting the font data, has been added. Glyphs can be exported in the EPS and SVG formats from the glyph editor. Basically this editor is identical to the one in DTL OTMaster, so the applicable part of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OT Manual<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can be used for reference.

Bonus: because the parameters can be applied on ‘skeleton’ lines, this works on outlines also. So, existing fonts can be converted to IK format and modified in LeMo using the sliders –for instance to make some proofs for other weights. 
 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LeMo_transform_2_4243.jpg]
 
Of course, one gets also to a certain extend distortions for free and the overlaps have to be removed afterwards (for instance in the LeMo glyph editor).

For the examples the regular weight of DTL Haarlemmer was used.
