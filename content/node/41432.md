  & simple. Easy and quick to draw digitally. Another is less so. virtually no straight
  lines. After getting about halfway though the uppercase in one weight, I'm thinking
  what I really want to do is draw the glyphs by hand, and scan them so all I'm doing
  (to the glyphs) on screen is a bit of clean-up and adjusting.\r\n\r\nAnybody else
  been there, done that? \r\n\r\n"
