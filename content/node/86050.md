    many videos as possible at the minute that are creative in a sense.\r\npreferably
    a music video along the lines of  hanz ritcher - rhythmus 21,23,25 (i know its
    not a music video) but in a style like it and also again even though its not a
    video bit of insperation of ideas im trying to find <a href=http://tinyurl.com/6fcg4pp>broadway
    boogie woogie</a>"

    a piece of work altogether. Perfect complement audio/visual\u2014dense, excessive
    noise. Not unlike <em>Rhythmus</em>.\r\n\r\nAlso Authechre with Cris Cunningham:
