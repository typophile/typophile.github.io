body: Customer sent us a PDF file to make screenprinting separations, but we need
  to make changes.  Opening the file in Illustrator works fine, but the original artist
  never outlined the fonts, so we are stuck redrawing the type unless we can get this
  font.  It looks like a strange morph between a collegiate face and Latinwide.  Google
  search revealed nothing.  Jpg attached.  Any help is appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Heat

    is what the font is called, according to Acrobat's document properties>fonts\r\n\r\nI
    just can't find any reference to such a font anywhere online.  Really odd."

  body: "Thanks, that sure looks like it.  I contacted the customer who contacted
    \ the artist who did the original design, and she said her company \"renames\"
    fonts, which is the weirdest thing I've ever heard.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for
    the help.  You guys are solid!"
