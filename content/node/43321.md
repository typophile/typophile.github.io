  body: "I think that the type of \"INC\" is Charlemagne after all. The  \"DMI\" may
    be Charlemagne, but I agree it appears there was some squooshing. \r\n\r\nThe
    type sample is from an envelope I came across. I like the pointiness of the C's
    serif. I also liked the bend where the serifs hit the baseline (not sure if that
    is official type lingo).\r\n\r\nThanks for your input!"

  body: "Huh? I guess you\u2019re overestimating the \u2018powers\u2019 of squooshing.
    Charlemagne has a very open \u2018C\u2019, next to the things I mentioned before.
    I agree with Jan, Bernhard Modern is a much better match. "
