  to my question.\r\nWhat do you think of combining ITC Avant Garde Gothic Pro for
  titles with Chaparral pro (typekit) for body copy?\r\n\r\nIf you think it wouldn't
  work, any tips would be very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: 'I think if the difference in size is big enough, you can combine almost anything.
    But I don''t think the aesthetic of these typefaces work well together. I think
    Chaparral could be nice, it is a friendly and warm face, but avant garde is cold
    and stylized, and it is too geometric (in a bad way). If you like a geometric
    face, try Futura, Avenir or Neuzeit.  '

  body: Avant Garde seems like an odd choice to pair with Chaparral. I once used Chaparral
    with Today Sans and they looked good together, both "warmth" and informal typefaces
    in my opinion; the "headline" cut of Today Sans should fit well if it must be
    set for titling. I'd also suggest Nick Shinn's Sensibility as a compaion sans.

  body: "Hi, thank you al so much for your comments! \r\nI was kinda hoping to get
    email updates on replies, but I didn't. Will check that in a bit. Sorry for the
    late reply.\r\n\r\nI'm stuck with the Avant Garde because someone else designed
    the identity with it (and yes I have mentioned the phrase \"Avant Garde only looks
    good when it spells Avant Garde\" ;o)\r\n\r\nBut well.. I'm not allowed to change
    that, too bad.\r\nThanks for the help anyways!"
