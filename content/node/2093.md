body: Hi all, i am doing a dvd cover called The Mistress starting Julianne Moore.
  I have used an image that is rather feminine yet empowered along with 30&#39;s feel,
  i would like to have suggestions on appropriate fonts for the movie title. Thus
  far, i&#39;ve tried paring Futura Medium  w/ 1&#41;Galliard, 2&#41;Castellar MT,
  3&#41;Bellevue. I am trying to capture the feeling of feminity and power. <BR>Suggestions
  and comments please. Thanks a bunch! =&#41;

  body: Dalliance is good, but I suggest <a href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90003.html"
    target="_blank">Ariston</a> from Berthold.  <BR> <BR>Yes, it is a Berthold face.
    Maybe someone else has it?  <BR> <BR>Vaughn Oliver used it quite a bit when he
    was designing for <a href="http://4ad.com/" target="_blank">4AD</a>. In my humble
    opinion, some of the best design for the music industry has occurred at 4AD.  <BR>
    <BR>And while you are there check out the photogallery. One of the happiest accidental
    photobook purchases I have ever made was of Tom Baril&#39;s work, published by
    4AD. Haunting.

  body: Thank you for the references, i&#39;ve come across Vendome, what are ur thoughts
    on it. I love the severe sharp egdes and it&#39;s still an elegant font.

  body: Vendome is a jewel, especially the Black weight. I guess it has a certain
    femininity, of a very brash kind, and you could say that implies power. Although
    Vendome also says playfulness to me. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: "Vend\xF4me is wonderful. Good call!! I am of the opinion that it has the
    dual masculine/feminine qualities because it is of French origin. Not afraid of
    expression.  <BR>"

    Adriano. These pictures aren&#39;t very good either, but maybe a flavor can be

    One seller wants 2,300.00US but that includes the slip cover.
