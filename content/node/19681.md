  for Windows that can auto-activate? I've heard bits & pieces about this, and have
  heard rumors that if Linotype ever releases Font-Explorer for Windows it might include
  auto-activation, but I don't understand why there seems to be nothing of the sort
  at the moment.\r\n\r\nWhat's the deal?"

  body: "How do you define auto activation? I assume you mean that if an application
    requests a font that's not installed it would be automatically installed? As far
    as I'm aware this would require some intelligence in the apps - the system itself
    just falls back to a default font in this case, and I think it's close to impossible
    for a font manager to insert itself between an app and the OS in this way - this
    wont change with Vista.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si "

  body: "There are really two types of auto-activation. In some cases an application
    can communicate directly with a font manager. For example, Suitcase Fusion uses
    Quark and InDesign plug-ins to read font information from the file and comunicate
    those requests to the parent application. If there is enough customer demand,
    this functionality could be added to a Windows font manager. The other type of
    auto-activation is the system-wide auto activation provided by ATS_Server on the
    Mac. Mac OS has a separate process for each user that handles font functionality.
    There are programming interfaces provided by Apple that make font activation possible.
    Basically, if any application requests a font that isn't active, a font manager
    can be notified and turn it on. On the Mac, this doesn't require the application
    developer to do anything special. It works in Word, for example. \r\n\r\nThere
    is a certain amount of complexity involved with this sort of functionality, and
    like any feature, it can create issues. With Microsoft, my guess is that the potential
    hazzards outweigh the benefits. It might be expensive or difficult to make a system
    that is backward compatible with existing applications, and it could introduce
    security risks. My guess is, there are very few users who would switch to Windows
    if they added it.... \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the input Simon and Carl,\r\n\r\nSimon, your reply is what I've
    run into before, but it doesn't recognize that this sort of interaction between
    app and OS is possible on the Mac now. My question was to the fact that if it
    is available on the Mac, why not the PC?\r\n\r\nCarl addressed this, but it still
    doesn't make sense to me (by that I mean my ignorance has not been defeated quite
    yet). If plug-ins are available on the Mac for Quark & InDesign (and others) to
    communicate with the font manager (in this case, Fusion or FontExplorerX), then
    isn't the same sort of plug-in possible on the PC? As for backwards-compatibility,
    the average user likely doesn't need a font manager, let alone auto-activation,
    and I'd be quite happy if this feature only worked with InDesign CS/CS2 as that's
    the only place I'm eager to have it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>If there is enough customer
    demand, this functionality could be added to a Windows font manager.</em>\r\n\r\nI've
    sent a few notes to Extensis in the past, with no response, but clearly my request
    doesn't amount to \"enough customer demand.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end I suppose this
    is, indeed, a \"special-interest\" issue, as I know I'm in the minority on my
    old PC, so I can't well expect quick solutions. The Linotype manager has frustrated
    the issue by hinting at an auto-activation-capable version for PC, and I suppose
    it's a combination of envy and impatience that led to my post.\r\n\r\nDan, you
    out there? Can you confirm if FontExplorer for PC is going to have auto-activation?
    I won't ask for a release date because I know that's taboo, but perhaps you could
    speak to the issues that have held auto-activation back from the PC.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a required font is installed but inactive, ATM automatically activates it. However,

    system-wide font activation on Windows. I think it's unlikely for the reasons
    described above: Mac OS X has a mechanism to notify other applications if a font

  body: "Again, I'm asking out of ignorance, but here's what I don't understand. When
    I open InD and get the warning/dialogue that fonts are missing, I click OK then
    head to Suitcase to activate the fonts needed. No big deal, but annoying.\r\n\r\nIs
    it for some reason impossible to write a script/plug-in/etc. that would intercept/recognize
    InD's warning, call-up the font management application, search the font list to
    locate the requested fonts, and activates them? I'm not a programmer, so perhaps
    I'm just searching for useful tools in the clouds, but this seems like a fairly
    simple sequence of actions. I'm assuming this is more or less what the current
    plug-ins for InD and Quark do for Fusion & FX."

    However, judging by the traffic on Typophile there is demand. I think companies
    should pay more attention to early adopter/power users, because they are responsible

    regarding InDesign; it's really the only app where I would want auto-activation. "

    or QuarkXPress, there is no problem to create auto-activation plugins, regardless
    of the system they run on. It's just that none of the software makers who create
    major font management applications (Linotype, Extensis, Insider) have yet released
    current versions of their font managers for Windows. Apparently, they don't consider
    the Windows market worth the trouble. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    might read Adam's comment and feel a bit of a sting.
