  body: It's somewhat similar to <a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm?sku=DL10123">Franklin
    Wide</a>. I would say it was hand lettered, also.

  body: Formlos, do you know when the sample was made? Is it recent (bad scan), 50's,
    60's etc. That info should always be included in a font request, or you will have
    Ives pulling his hair out of his head. Oops

  body: '<em>Thanks</em>.. Its from a match box.. A recent ( bad ) scan, but also
    a vintage logotype.. <em>( According to <a href="http://www.swedishmatch.com"
    target="_blank">www.swedishmatch.com</a>.: ''..Three Stars is a 120 year old,
    truly international brand, originating from the Joenkoeping Westra match factory
    in Sweden..'' ) But, I am not too sure about the age of the actual sampled logotype
    / lettering..</em>'

  body: My guess is being a match company they haven't had to change their idenity
    and I'd bet its pre-digital. So I'd have to go with Mark's suggestion as a starting
    point. Place the scan in illustrator, set it in Fanklin Wide and start moving
    some of the points around.

  body: "> they haven\u2019t had to change their idenity\r\n\r\nReally? I would point
    out that fire has acquired an increasingly bad reputation over the 20th century,
    so a redesign some time over the past  decade or two isn't far fetched. That's
    why \"safety matches\" (ones that don't light?!) were invented after all...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
