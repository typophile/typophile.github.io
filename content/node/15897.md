  body: "Well, we may use it for packaging, stationery, etc. Not sure yet. Just trying
    to spec out a body sans to accompany l.c. Hercules titles.\r\n\r\nThanks, Stephen.\r\n\r\nAnd
    keep up the great work here - I'm an avid fan.\r\n\r\n--Michael.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n//

  body: "BTW -\r\nI've thought about using the standard \"stick with the designer's
    other faces\" philosophy - i.e., using Sebastian - but I find its x-height pretty
    small for sizes below 11 pt.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of a humanist sans like
    Syntax or even Frutiger?\r\n\r\nMaybe I should think Seria, Scala, or Fedra?\r\n\r\nWhat
    are your thoughts?"

  body: Michael, do you know about WBGO? I don't know where you're from but its the
    best Jazz station on the east coast of the US. If you're from anywhere out of
    the area you can hear it at WBGO.org (its a non-profit station), online streaming.

    a fan of WKCR (Columbia U.), WDUQ, et al.\r\n\r\nWeb radio has been a huge boon
    for the jazz fan!\r\n\r\n--Michael.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n//

    have a look at Splendid Sans or Dyna Grotesk."

  body: I've been wanting to try Hercules with <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html">Proxima
    Sans</a> -- their x-heights are very close, and since Hercules is a "modern" design
    it ought to go nicely with Proxima.

  body: "Hmmmm...\r\n\r\nProxima's an interesting foil, indeed.\r\n\r\nI think we
    may end up with Frutiger after all, to keep with standard corporate ID. Gotham
    sure is pretty, too.\r\n\r\nNow if only I can get the boss to go for Hercules
    in all lower case for the title...\r\n\r\n--Michael.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n//
