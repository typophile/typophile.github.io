body: I am a fan of www.simpledesktops.com so  it was a thrill to have curator Tom
  Watson put up my White Ampersands design. The ampersand was handlettered with a
  round nib and black India ink. I then scanned it and cleaned it up in AI. No, not
  artificial intelligence.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/white_ampersands_detail_6179.jpg]

    much it reminds me of the teal windows 98 wallpaper. sorry :( the teal colour
    will forever be ruined by windows. '

    [[http://www.pantone.com/pages/Pantone/Pantone.aspx?pg=20705&ca=4|Colour of the
    Year for 2010]]. I had no idea Windows 98 used that colour. '
