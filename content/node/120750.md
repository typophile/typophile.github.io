  I have a client that wants this particular font but I can't find anything that matches.
  Does anyone know what this font is?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    lettering. The only repeating character, _9_, looks virtually the same, but there
    are minor differences, which could be due either to hand lettering or poor printing.
