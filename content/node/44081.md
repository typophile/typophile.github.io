body: "I was at the Museum of Fine Arts Houston this past weekend, and all of the
  titling for the Miwa Yanagi exhibition was printed in huge letters on the wall in
  this typeface. It looks like a phone book typeface (given the ink wells), but I
  don't know any phone book typefaces besides Bell Centennial (which it is very obviously
  not). Any help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/publication_4213.gif]\r\n\r\nI'm
  sorry I don't have a bigger picture, but I think you can get the idea.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEdit:
  I can't find a picture, but the y was especially strange. The tail started straight
  down from the center (with an ink well to either side), then slanted left.\r\n\r\nHere's
  a (poorly drawn) example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/y_6323.gif]"

  body: Cool, thanks! Do you know anything about where this typeface is used? It was
    obviously developed for small text, but I don't think I'd ever seen it before
    this past weekend, when it was very clearly not being used as originally intended.

    not meant to serve their original purpose."

  body: IIRC This issue came out right around the same time that students everywhere
    were addicted to Bell Gothic because it was the only font that had that "look".
