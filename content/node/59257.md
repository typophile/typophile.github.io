  body: 'Moving future Fontlab releases to Adobe AIR seems like a great idea to me.
    Fontlab has a tiny user base and supporting multiple platforms is a waste of scarce
    resources. '

  body: Oh no. I suggest that the Fontlab guys concentrate on the Windows platform,
    and the Dutch concentrate on OS X. We just need that glyph editor Georg... By
    the way, who uses DLT FontTools (other than DLT)?

    they run on every platform. But they also suck on every platform.\xBB\r\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/140209/2009/04/tweetie_brichter_interview.html"

  body: I'm looking forward to it! But I doubt the supposed switch will happen in
    v6. Besides, Yuri already revealed the plans for the next version of Fontlab.
    He laid them out at Robothon http://blip.tv/file/1911058

    pallets in Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator are actually tiny flash applications
    interacting with your software.\r\n\r\nA perfect example of this is the kuler
    pallet in Illustrator. Go to Window > Adobe Labs > Kuler. You can see how well
    integrated it is to the application with the added benefit of communicating to
    the kuler site.\r\n\r\nI don't know how Fontlab6 will use Flash but don't write
    off their interest in Flash right away."
