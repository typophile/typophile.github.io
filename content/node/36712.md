  \r\n\r\n\"...Helmetag and his team are currently working on three major projects
  in New York. One is the World Trade Center Memorial\u2019s names commemoration as
  well as the site graphics. The commission includes extensive collaboration with
  the memorial\u2019s architect and landscape architect, and C&G is in the process
  of creating a unique typeface that will <STRONG>combine the latest computer technology
  with the ancient art of bronze casting</STRONG>\" \r\n\r\n...sounds a lot more interesting
  than it probably is, but for now I'm picturing a customized Linotype caster with
  a digital interface and military-spec upgrades to handle bronze instead of lead.
