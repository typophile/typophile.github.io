  and throw this one out there as kind of a poll question... <BR> <BR>what is it that
  inspires you to create a typeface? <BR>from what source do you derive the passion
  it takes to do so? <BR> <BR>&#40;if you could reference works/artists/etc. with
  links, that&#39;d be great&#41;

  body: Well, the thing that definitively interested me on type was a facsimile copy
    of a page of a book printed by William Morris set in his Troy type, shown to us
    in a conference at school about two years ago. <BR> <BR>I was atonished by the
    rich texture and stared for a while to the page. When I was back at home I searched
    for some online information about his types. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.octavo.com/collections/projects/chkwks/jpgs/014chkwks22.jpg"

    As any threatened minority will tell you, being different helps you stay yourself.
    Remember that the Mormons carried out an auto-exodus to the middle of nowhere.
    <BR> <BR>The Deseret alphabet failed because: <BR>1&#41; It&#39;s very hard to

    &#40;and going so far as to assemble an honest-to-God [no pun intended] army&#41;...
    Mormon Zionism in this case. <BR> <BR>Later, however, the church had no choice
    but to forsake polygamy &#40;at least in these times and at that place&#41; if
    it wanted Utah to be taken in as a state &#40;and it did&#41;. <BR> <BR>Sorry

  body: Ok. I guess I have to respond. :^/ This is where I wish I would&#39;ve paid
    more attention to the history classes at school. <BR> <BR>i believe polygamy served
    a purpose at that time of the church for a very specific reason. i also believe
    that it would have ended anyway, but what a coincidence that it ended for statehood.
    &#40;everything happens for a reason ... luther/gutenberg, religion/scriptures,
    missionaries/books&#41; agh this is becoming a new thread ... sorry. <BR> <BR>wasn&#39;t
    the army actually formed for protection? &#40;again probably slept through this
    one&#41; <BR> <BR>I won&#39;t completely say you are wrong Hrant. Your two points
    make sense. As does you anti-asssimilation point. They had been persecuted out
    of several areas. But i think the main point is that the Church has had missionaries
    from the word go. For this religion &#40;any religion or group of people that
    wish to share or discuss something&#41; to work the missionaries had to have books
    in the language of those with whom they were proselytizing. It made no sense in
    the end to form a new language if they really wanted the missionaries to be able
    to go around the world. They would have had to first have people accept the message
    and learn a new language. This would take everyone back in time when only a select
    group could actually read the scriptures. &#40;I&#39;m sure I&#39;m losing track
    of my thoughts&#41; I believe that the message was to be shared and they realized
    it couldn&#39;t have been and so abandoned Deseret. Instead focusing on learning
    other international languages and translating the Book of Mormon into those languages.
    &#40;today for instance the Book of Mormon can be had in 111 <a href="http://www.ldscatalog.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/%20CategoryDisplay?%20catalogId=10001&amp;storeId=10001&amp;categoryId=100054&amp;langId=%20-1&amp;parent_category_rn=100003&amp;bcname=Missionary%20Book%20of%20Mormon&amp;top=%20Y&amp;resetCat=N&amp;initBC=Y&amp;level=2&amp;replBC=subcatlist100003&amp;fromHomeBC=Y"

    organizations, religions, groups, etc. that wish to talk to others either have
    to find common ground on which to discuss &#40;whatever topic, type for instance&#41;
    or find a way to talk the language of those whom they wish to speak. That is,
    I believe, the real reason behind the alphabet being abandoned. That is not to
    say the Church only uses the latin alphabet though. Today the Book of Mormon is
    available in over 111 different languages &#40;as well as the King James version
    of the bible, used also and in conjunction with the BoM&#41; <BR> <BR>If you had
    something you wanted to share with as many people as possible, wouldn&#39;t you
    do what you could to translate it into something they could read? I don&#39;t

    need a Hebrew font for use in business communication&#39;, that inspires something
    different from saying &#39;We need a Hebrew font for critical editions of the
    Hebrew Bible&#39;. I can&#39;t always describe how this inspiration works, or
    why a particular need, expressed by the client, pushes me in a particular direction.
    But the client&#39;s needs are the start of inspiration. They also, helpfully,
    act as a compass during the design exploration: I know what the destination is
    supposed to be, even if I don&#39;t know exactly what it looks like yet.'

    least during the formative period they were also rightly worried about self-preservation.
    These two things are in conflict, and I wouldn&#39;t be suprised if the Mormons
    most anxious to spread the word were silently cursing the whole Deseret thing.
    And maybe they just won in the end, because the Mormon community became more confident
    and secure. If one day that&#39;s no longer true, don&#39;t be surprised to see
    Deseret make an abrupt return. <BR> <BR>And don&#39;t be so apologetic about polygamy.

  body: 'William, I think there&#39;s a difference between demonstrable fraud on the
    lines of an individual making a claim about e.g. a translation of a text which
    is then proven to be a fantastic fabrication, and mounting an exegetical and historical
    investigation to suggest an alternative view of early Christianity and its relationship
    to Pharisee Judaism. The latter is interesting, as are other recent books that
    paint a quite different picture of Paul, i.e. Paul as himself an observant Jew
    and not representing a radical break and a new religion. Both these lines of thought
    about Paul are based on consideration of the New Testament texts and on historical
    investigation. Neither <i>proves</i> its case, and neither proves that the traditional
    Christian version is incorrect. I have no problem with this kind of intellectual,
    critical investigation of my religion, because I&#39;m interested in truth. This
    also means that I&#39;m interested in seeing the limits of such investigations
    -- as regards proof -- acknowledged. <BR> <BR>The matter of Joseph Smith is of
    a different order: various of his claims are demonstrably <i>proven</i> to be
    false. He probably didn&#39;t think anyone would ever actually decipher hieroglyphs
    and hieratic script, so he could make up whatever he wanted. Ironically, at almost
    exactly the same time, Champollion was making the first accurate decipherment
    of ancient Egyptian texts. <BR> <BR>I think it is always necessary to question
    authority, to question the basis on which authority is claimed. And I say this
    as a member of the Catholic Church, which claims for itself the most extraordinary
    authority. Faith and gullibility are not good partners, but faith and intellect
    are. As Simone Weil wrote: true authority has nothing to fear from the pursuit
    of truth. <BR> <BR>Tiffany and I are continuing this in e-mail, so I&#39;m perfectly

    I come across, explored to varying degrees. This can point in new directions.
    I also recognize other themes which can interact with the ones I have. Believing
    in synchronicity, I pursue obscure, eclectic lines of research in the expectation
    that this will increase the likelihood of serendipity occuring. I shake up my
    circumstances from time to time,  For instance... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m moving at the
    moment, and am packing up a lot of stuff and throwing other stuff out. I was going
    to throw out a 1994 Bazaar, but the type caught my eye. It was set in HTF Didot,
    and the art director had combined different sizes of the face in the same &#40;department
    heading&#41; word, with the appropriate optical scaling. That reminded me of the
    way that the ultra thin weights of Luc de Groot&#39;s &#34;Taz&#34; work -- a
    similar kind of optical scaling &#40;I had been talking with Luc about that at
    TypeCon&#41;. It was an idea I had explored a little with the ultra thin weights
    of Bodoni Egyptian. A few months ago I went to see &#34;M&#34;, Fritz Lang&#39;s
    1929 film, at a movie theatre, and was very taken with the title lettering. Of
    course I couldn&#39;t see it clearly, as the image was scrolling and somewhat
    distressed, so I was perhaps imagining things that weren&#39;t there. Anyway,
    I later tried to draw it from memory as an alphabet, but couldn&#39;t decide on
    the x-height. So I&#39;m thinking maybe I can do it with just one weight, but
    in a family that has many members with different x-heights, from absurdly tiny
    to what looks practically like a unicase, with vestigial extenders. So that could

    that is &#34;the answer to a question that nobody asked&#34;, but what the heck.
    <BR> <BR>Why do particular design themes inspire me? I don&#39;t know if they
    inspire me, it&#39;s more like I find them &#34;useful&#34; &#40;in the way that
    soccer commentators describe a pass&#41; for setting up the kind of design puzzle
    that I will enjoy tackling, with an eventual sense of accomplishment when it&#39;s
    finished. <BR> <BR>As for &#34;from what source do you derive the passion&#34;,
    well, the &#34;why&#34; question, especially with such purple phrasing, is going
    to get the heavy answers, ain&#39;t it? I like the St. Augustine rationale: I
    believe in order to understand. I&#39;ve answered the question before, similarly,
    with &#34;for me, type design is an epistemological pursuit &#34;, and been accused

  body: My respect for individual religions is based upon the claims of those religions
    and how well those claims stand up to scrutiny, not the sincerity of their followers.
    If someone wants to believe that God is an invisible white rabbit named Harvey
    because someone claiming to be divinely inspired told him it was so based upon
    a demonstrably false translation of an Egyptian funeral text, I&#39;m not going
    to respect that simply on the basis of the sincerity of the belief. People have
    sincerely believed all sorts of nonsense throughout history, and we can love them
    and even respect the genuineness of their beliefs, but that doesn&#39;t mean we
    shouldn&#39;t question <i>what</i> they believe. The falsity of the so-called
    &#39;Book of Abraham&#39; is obvious in light of the accurate translation of the
    same papyri by Egyptologists. I refuse to believe that a lie can bring anyone
    closer to a true understanding of God. <BR> <BR>Joe, I wouldn&#39;t want you or
    anyone else to respect my religion based on my sincere desire to practice it.
    I hope William, for example, acknowledges the genuineness of my belief in the
    claims of Catholicism, but I&#39;m also glad that he is critical and willing to
    challenge those claims. As I wrote to Tiffany in e-mail, it is not my intent to
    offend or upset anyone, any more than I think it is William&#39;s intent to upset
    or offend me when he suggests that Christianity is a myth invented by St Paul
    that bears little relationship to Christ&#39;s actual life or teachings, even
    though this constitutes an attack on the fundamentals of my religion. These are
    valid questions and reasonable challenges with which Catholic apologetics should
    be willing to engage. There are also valid questions and challenges to fundamentals
    of Mormonism, many concerning the authority of Smith&#39;s revelations, that intelligent
    Mormons should be willing to engage with. <BR> <BR>I also think that Jews have
    a responsibilty to be critical of Christianity, because Christian beliefs undermine
    Judaism in ways that cannot be reconciled. Similarly, Christians have a responsibility
    to be critical of Islam and, yes, Mormonism, because these undermine Christianity.
    When one religion derives some of its beliefs from an earlier religion, but interprets
    that religion in new and radical ways, the followers of the older religion have
    every right to object. Mormonism hijacks and distorts important aspects of my
    religion. I&#39;m well aware that, from the Jewish perspective, my religion hijacks
    and distorts aspects of Judaism, which is why I have no right to demand that William
    or any other Jew have respect for what I believe even though, obviously, I do
    not share that perspective.

    <BR>John, I agree with the &#39;should&#39;, but I rarely see acknowledgement
    of the existence of such serious, scholarly critiques as Maccoby&#39;s, much less
    reasoned responses to them.  <BR> <BR>Generally on religious issues people just
    get offended by criticism of their religion, and don&#39;t want to respond to
    it. The reaction here to your criticism of Mormonism here is the normal one. This
    reaction seems to me to be equally typical of Christians - and those of other
    faiths - generally.  <BR> <BR>What I see in the US are the airwaves and internet
    replete with Christians rather smugly preaching to everyone - especially Jews
    - the superior wisdom of Christianity. And those proselytizing don&#39;t acknowledge
    or respond to the long tradition of criticism of Christianity by Jews and atheists
    - and Muslims. <BR> <BR>&#62;I&#39;m interested in seeing the limits of such investigations
    -- as regards proof -- acknowledged.  <BR>  <BR>The analysis of ancient historical
    documents and archeological evidence can never be as conclusive as proof in mathematics
    or empirical testing in science. However, some historical analysis can be pretty
    persuasive in explaining otherwise baffling evidence or puzzling texts. For example,
    I heard about Maccoby&#39;s book from an adult student of mine. He was a thoughtful
    religious seeker, and he was so impressed by the book&#39;s argument - an historical
    critique of the New Testament - that, after further inquiry, he abandoned Christianity.
    <BR> <BR>I deeply respect sincere Christians. But I wish more would be aware of
    how ill-informed Christian proselytizing looks to knowledgable non-Christians.  <BR>
    <BR>I would be happy if vigorous civil debate of religious issues - including

    a back seat is an impossible task. By its nature, it tends to be the most important
    thing in the life of a believer, and this is by and large a good thing. The trick
    -- and I admit that it is sometimes difficult and that I often fail -- is to disagree
    fundamentally with someone <i>and still treat him or her with decency.</i> If
    decency relied on our ignoring the most important things in each others&#39; lives,

    in cause. Religion may help stir up passions and draw lines, but I think there

    take a break from work for a few minutes and blather about whatever is on their
    minds. So long as they avoid personal insults or threats, it seems pretty harmless
    to me. <BR> <BR>Back to inspiration. Creativity in every field, whether in science
    or philosophy or the arts is a matter of problem-solving.  <BR> <BR>The inspiration
    comes partly in seeing and choosing new problems. Here a lot of the inspiration
    comes from looking at past work. The trick is to be both appreciative and critical
    - understanding the past without being bound by it. When you appreciate, you understand
    what the person was up to. When you are critical, you can see how they could have
    chosen another problem, or pulled off the solution better. More broadly, there
    is an historical understanding of traditions - how one effort influenced another
    where the turning points were. All this gives you an insight into what new paths
    you might explore.  <BR> <BR>An often ignored part of this in education is the
    need to keep fresh the goals that led you into the field in the first place. I
    think that spark should be nurtured always, for it is what makes you see things
    differently from others, and leads you to make a distinctive contribution.  <BR>
    <BR>An example of problem shoice is Nick&#39;s choice of the problem of producing
    a unicase, monowidth face; and he did multiple related solutions. In revivals,
    many people have tried to see what should stay the same and what should change
    for new ways of producing fonts and new way of printing.  <BR> <BR>Paul, you&#39;ve
    seen some pleasures in an old type that others hadn&#39;t seen the the joy in.
    And Chris went for modernism and greater variety in letter forms. Hrant is obviously
    inspired by the problem of improving readability of text fonts.   <BR> <BR>All
    this is in seeing and choosing problems. I found in studying history of science
    the greatest originality is at this stage.  <BR> <BR>The other aspects are your
    imagination and talent in creating solutions. Imagination is the ability to come
    up with fresh solutions. Again an appreciative and critical eye is a help, but
    also a free spirit, seeing broad connections - even in religion! - and a treasuring
    of your own individuality.  <BR> <BR>Talent relates most specifically to the field
    of endeavor. In type, there is more than one talent at work, but certainly one
    is artistic, visual talent of doing beautiful curves. Another is in being able
    to visualize that complex geometry of how shapes will harmonize one with the other.
    Here talent help you come up with not just new and varied solutions, but good
    ones. Guys like Garamond, Bodoni, Zapf, Frutiger- they have the gift. <BR> <BR>One
    thing I find interesting is that it is rare that the greatest serif and sans serif
    fonts come from the same hand. Is there a different talent involved in each? Why
    is that?'

    see myself spending much time designing a traditional serif text face.  It has
    nothing to do with my opinion of such faces.  I love them and use them daily.
    Perhaps I think I cannot come close to a Garamond or simply that serif faces don&#39;t
    speak to me the need for a new one--but that is just me. I hope others will pursue
    them.  The Sans serif, to me, has much more growing to do and I see the questions
    it asks me and that inspires me to try to answer by designing more sans be they

    to overlap US character Jerry Falwell to Mother Theresa of Calcutta. Both &#34;catholic&#34;,
    then, spot the difference. <BR>What&#39;s universal &#40;catholic&#41; is always
    transferable. <BR>Like my beloved Letraset sheets &#40;from which my own inspiration
    came when I was 16, almost 20 years ago&#41;. <BR>Live your faith in love instead
    of talking about it. It&#39;s such a simple thing. That&#39;s why it&#39;s otherwordly
    difficult. You can&#39;t do it alone. <BR>'

  body: In the end I may say that I find very inspiring when I design, to clash together
    parts in conflict and end up with an improvement. <BR> <BR>All the tension behind
    many of my old typefaces came from the idea of dealing with inner &#40;and outer&#41;
    conflicts. Now that I&#39;ve found a relative calm, I see better how you the user
    and the possible readers come first. As a letter and type designer, no matter
    the kind of face you&#39;re working on, you must consider this, even when expressing
    something very personal. Quality is not just a commodity.
