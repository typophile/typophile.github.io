  body: Several years ago, it was very trendy to use this font that was never meant
    to be used as a stand-alone font. I still really like it.

  body: "Hi Mike, Rosewood is near the top of my recommendations for well constructed
    ornate fonts. Everything is top notch, including the design of the letterforms
    for the basic fill -- an excellent balancing of restrained & sensuous , as is
    confirmed by the design's popularity as a standalone display font.\r\nDon"
