  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">We were disappointed, but not surprised, that Erik Spiekermann, a noted and respected type designer and author, would knowingly make false and misleading statements regarding Berthold in a public forum. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As such statements affect the reputation of Berthold Types, I am responding with this posting. I attach a letter dated June 3, 2004, to Mr. Spiekermann explaining the actual facts behind the continuation of H. Berthold's type business by Berthold Types. This letter is from Berthold Types Limited's German attorneys because the subject matter involves German law. We arranged for the attached English translation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Although the letter to Mr. Spiekermann addresses the myths and misconceptions perpetuated by Mr. Spiekermann's comments, I would like to make a few points: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Berthold Designers <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mr. Spiekermann states that Berthold Types has no contracts with any of the original Berthold designers even though he is well aware of the agreement with Guenter Gerhard Lange.  Mr. Spiekermann, a friend of Mr. Lange, tried to persuade Mr. Lange against working with Berthold Types but failed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Contrary to Mr. Spiekermann's statement, Berthold Types has agreements with Guenter Gerhard Lange, Bernd Moellenstaedt, Dieter Hofrichter, Orjan Nordling and Prof. Werner Schneider.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash;Mr. Lange (at 83) is working on new typefaces for Berthold Types; having completed Whittingham in 2001 and additions to his other typefaces (Bodoni Old Face and Imago). He also has a new typeface yet to be released and has embarked on another large typeface project for Berthold Types. Mr. Lange as artistic consultant is actively involved in future type releases by Berthold. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash;Mr. Moellenstaedt has created a new, large typeface family for Berthold Types (yet to be released) as well as preparing additional offerings of Formata. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash;Prof. Schneider recently completed and Berthold Types released his Senatus typeface. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash;Mr. Hofrichter works on many projects for Berthold's type program and works closely with Berthold Types to insure the continued quality of the Berthold type program. He works directly with GGL on all his new releases. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All of the contracts between H. Berthold AG and the designers specifically stated that when a typeface design falls into the public domain the obligation by Berthold to pay royalities ceases. Berthold Types offered to pay designers nonetheless. Notwithstanding, Hans Reichel chose to release a reworking of Barmeno. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interestingly, according to H. Berthold's royalty worksheet, Mr. Spiekermann was never paid royalties on an ongoing basis for Berliner Grotesk and LoType.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Registration of Berthold's Trademarks <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mr. Spiekermann also implies that any company could simply register H. Berthold's trademarks. This is simply not true. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Type division of H. Berthold was a separated in October 1991 and the Type assets were &quot;leased&quot; back to H. Berthold by a consortium of banks. The Type division was not a part of the H. Berthold AG bankruptcy in 1993 and was separate from Berthold's other businesses. Berthold Types acquired the type assests (e.g. the trademarks as well as other IP rights &ndash; see the attached letter) through the chain of title through these banks, not through bankruptcy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Accordingly, contrary to Mr. Spiekermann's statements, over 80 German trademark registrations, and numerous UK and US registrations, were assigned through the &quot;chain of title&quot; from H. Berthold AG to Berthold Types, including the &quot;Berthold in a red square logo&quot; and the &quot;H. Berthold&quot; trademarks.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. Protection of Berthold's IP Rights <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mr. Spiekermann states that Berthold Types has been &quot;suing dozens of people with frivolous cases which have cost me and other designers and foundries millions of dollars (and I am not exaggerating).&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's a myth. In fact, Berthold Types has filed only twelve lawsuits two of which were against FSI/FontShop (both for trademark infringement). Mr. Spiekermann cannot provide any basis supporting losses of &quot;millions of dollars.&quot; Type is just not that large of a business.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If Mr. Spiekermann wants to debate: Stick to the facts, please. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Respectfully, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Harvey Hunt <!-- raw HTML omitted -->President <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Berthold Types Limited <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Translation<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spiekermann_Translation.pdf<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (91.9 k)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for telling us your side of the story. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two questions, if I may: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) You cited 5 designers with whom you have a valid business relationship. How many designers total are represented in your library? How would you describe the relationship with them? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) &quot;Berthold Types has filed only twelve lawsuits&quot;. May we please know how many &quot;cease and desist&quot; and other what might be informally called &quot;pre-lawsuit&quot; letters you have sent out? I think this is significant because -as anybody knows- a confrontational letter (especially when directed to individuals with modest or non-existent legal resources) can have nearly the same effect as a lawsuit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I ask these question only in the interest of full disclusure (some of us simply enjoy knowing), not as a potential basis for persecution.

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Mr. Hunt, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a graphic designer, I appreciate the Berthold type library, particularly Akzidenz Grotesk, which may come at no surprise as I'm sure its very popular. In fact, I'd be inclined to say that if stranded on a desert island with one font and a newletter to publish, AG would be a top choice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, when our studio is looking to purchase new fonts, I'm less inclined to purchase from Berthold when I have heard so many rumblings of lawsuits and cease-and-desist letters to other, arguably smaller, type foundries over similar-sounding font naming taxonomies.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I attended TypeCon last year, I was heartened to get my first taste of the cameraderie of the type design industry, not to mention observing over the last few years the friendliness of font industry designers and reps in their interactions here at Typophile, many of which are small business owners working very hard to stay afloat and perfect their craft in a tough industry. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Many foundries and retailers were represented at TypeCon; I don't recall any Berthold presence, other than careful mentions in hushed conversations. Come to think of it, I rarely hear of anything other than legal action and scare tactics. Surely you must understand that while these actions intend to protect your assets from infringement, the perceptions of the end customer suffer. How would you respond to this? As one of the established names/brands in the industry, what is Berthold doing to preserve the craft and build the community?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sincerely,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->B.

		<div class="commentbody">I am happy to see that the president of Berthold has posted on this forum. Although, I must agree with Mr. Spiekermann and the others here: posting a response on this forum would have been a more polite first step than having an attorney draft a letter and send it to him first. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think that the public exchange of opinion over the internet is one it's biggest perks. While it is obvious that Mr. Spiekermann's opinion of Berthold is not a positive one, I do not think that his statements were libelous or defamatory. (He is certainly entitled to his opinion, and he is also entitled to propogate it politely) Also, we are only looking at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a few short posts on an online forum.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I think, if someone with Mr. Spiekerman's gravitas in the type community wanted to go to war with Berthold, he easily could. And he wouldn't need do it via banter on an online forum. Berthold is certainly aware of this. I don't understand their ultra-protectionary, overtly legal-feeling reaction. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->B.Gibbs has an interesting point, too. Monotype, Linotype, FontShop, E+F, and many other founderies all have presences at large type events and activities. Their designers all lecture, too. Is Berthold not doing this because it can't afford the costs? At TYPO Berlin, the Managing Director of Linotype, talking about piracy protection, said that the best way to prevent piracy is through technological and design innovation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He didn't say that the best method was sending out cease-and-desist letters.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wonder what the impression of Berthold on this forum would be if it had spent the money required for its 12 lawsuits, or even the legal and translation fees necessary for the letter to Mr. Spiekermann, on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->product marketing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instead?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(However, Mr. Spiekermann, it is well-known that Linotype and many other foundries do file law suits to protect their work from piracy. I am assuming that FontShop does this as well. Can you tell me if cease-and-desist letters are common in our industry? Berthold may or may not have sent out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->too many<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but how many are sent out by their competitors?) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hallo Titus! sch</div>

This thread is not a forum to discuss Hrant or his already well documented political feelings. Propaganda extremists of all persuasions often use a cheap trick  to diffuse criticism and point blame at some convenient scapegoat.  Their point is to swing the conversation to something else to divert attention and replace it with an attack on either the original source or to dump on anyone close enough.  Willie Horton was used this way in the Dukakis campaign. The Jews in the 30s were used this way to take the heat away from the new Nazi government. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The ploy always involves a nameless heckler to act as a distraction and keep everyone from going back to the real issue. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How about if we just ignore the heckler(s) and confine discussion to the original intent of this thread and not respond at all to the heckler? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I'll bet that I am the next victim, within seconds of my posting this) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Like an insect bite, IGNORE THE ITCH, SCRATCHING IT ONLY MAKES IT WORSE.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In my opinion, this issue has nothing to do with the Nazis, Jews, or the second World War. These are not only off topic additions/comments, they could also poison discussion to the extent that Berthold and/or Mr. Spiekermann would no longer respond to the points discussed above. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would really, really, like to hear from Mr. Hunt, and hear his opinion about Berthold's opinion in the design community. Perhaps he thinks that we are a bunch of nuts, and taht our opinions are not representative. Perhaps he even has sales figures to back that up! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> But I would really like to know&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would also like to hear how many lawsuits FontShop has filed, or something similiar, to use as a point of comparison. If FSI has filed 24 lawsuits in the same time period that Berthold filed 12, that says something. If they filed 2, that says something else. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant, we all know your opinions about the US Government, and its legal system. In some respects, you are right, especially when it comes to Type and its protection. EU courts offer type designs and foundries much more protection, I think. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, bashing the US court system, is not so relevant to this topic, I think. Many of the lawsuits in discussion were filed in European courts, so the US and its benefits/fallacies, play little effect. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, I think that &quot;Trademarking&quot; something is more of an international process now than a national one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Again, lets talk about Berthold. Perhaps they really are the demon of the type world. Perhaps we are mistaken in our opinion. I don't think that we will learn anything about these questions from discussing the ideals of democracy, or the prelude to the Holocaust. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(As I side note, I'll bite that I am very interested in talking about democracy in general, the US court system in particular, or even the treatment of Jews by the Nazi government from 1933 to 1945!

It is much simpler. but going into it may cost me a lot of money in lawyers' fees again. The officers of FontShop International are restrained from discussing certain legal issues. This goes back to a certain foundry in Illinois selling fonts but keeping the money due to some small legal clause in the contract. The licensor in Berlin had to pay the original designers, of course, plus lots and lots of lawyers' fees. This is where me mentioning seven digits came from. While i am not an officer of FSI. but simply a shareholder, that said outfit by the lake is very trigger-happy and even has a family member who belongs to the legal profession, making it easy to issue writs and all manner of legal proceedings which usually require at least a reply by another lawyer, in English. And that costs money, lots. Most of the suits are frivolous: there is a typeface called Signata. There is another face called Signa, the 2 look not a bit alike, but a letter was written asking to change that name as it would infringe upon the rights of that foundry by the lake. Which itself has another font named Signal which apparently cannot be confused with Signata, while Signa can. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FSI has pursued pirates, people who simply copy FontFonts and offer them under a different name. If someone offered a font named Unite, i wouldn't give a damn, as long as it wasn't a copy of my own FF Unit.

Because he cheated and still cheats designers out of their money, and they all know it and let him know that they know.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And i do know what goes on at B in C, as i do know what has been going on at B in B since the mid-60s. I designed most of their literature, reworked the logo and the corporate design in the 80s, made my first typefaces for them, wrote a book for them and was friends with their designers, managers and technicians here in Berlin.</div>

I'm a national of Russia. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A year ago I started selling my products (digital typefaces) with the MyFonts.com, Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). In August, 2003 I received a complaint from another American company - Berthold Types Limited (Chicago, Illinois). Ms Melissa M. Hunt alleged that the names of my web-site and my fonts do infringe their registered trademark CITY. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My web-site is named 'fontcity.ru'. My fonts are named after Russian cities: 'City of Moskva' (Moskva is Moscow in Russian), 'City of Khabarovsk', 'City of Tsaritsyn', etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ms Hunt alleged that Berthold has registered the TM &quot;CITY&quot; and that my fonts names are a 'colorable imitation' of this TM. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I strongly oppose this position: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I suppose the word &quot;city&quot; is a generic term and is not a particularly strong TM. Moreover, I am a national of Russia and Berthold has no registered TM in Russia. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- My fonts are performed in an original graphical manner and the whole line of typefaces has its own unique style. There cannot be any confusion between my fonts and the ones of Berthold company. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Moreover, I use the word &quot;city&quot; in its original lexical meaning, in an illustrative and descriptive way only. This word is a part of a single whole concept I create to present my products. I have created my own unique style including typefaces (the character shapes), their names, description texts, music, animation, pictures, color palette and so on. I invented the new word 'FONTCITY' for naming my web-site. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I understand, that the names 'Moskva', 'Khabarovsk', 'Tsaritsyn' and so on mean nothing to the most of people, not only Americans, but Russians too. I can't delete or substitute the word &quot;city&quot; without distortion of the names' sense. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- I can't name my fonts in Russian because there are certain rules requiring to use the numbers and English letters only for this purpose. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I know, many companies and persons were urged to change the names of their fonts by Berthold.

		<div class="commentbody">Here Mr. Phinney represents his employer and therefore cannot speak as freely for himself as the rest of us because that might be construed as coming from Adobe. I don't blame him for that and I appreciate truth coming from anyone and everyone since I have no way of knowing who the honest ones are.  I don't know about the Adobe &quot;compatability lists&quot; and have never heard of them prior to today.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There does seem to be a great deal of at least sentiment, if not evidence, that the once proud name of Berthold has now fallen to the level of vicious predator.  It would seem that Berthold should be forthcoming and lay ALL of the truth on the table very soon if it wants to have any chance to redeem itself in the eyes of the community which not only buys but specs and recomends type faces to the world. Typographers, type designers, art directors, graphic designers, and publishers are the gatekeepers of type purchase.  If many of them boycott any single foundry, it can have a large impact on their profits.  We have many alternative suppliers to choose from and are within our rights for any reason to use and recomend (or not recomend) any typeface or vendor.  Berthold may have legal means of preventing others from naming fonts to their liking and not paying designers for their work but there is no law that says we MUST use their products if we choose not to.  No company can survive abusing their own clients.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ChrisL</div>

The average computer user only uses the fonts that come bundled free with other software or operating system.  The concept of buying type is pretty much tied to the design and publishing industry.  Corporations use what their design/branding consultants recomend. If you look at advertising by type houses, you can see it is tailored to the same crowd.  Ads are placed in the design trade mags with lots of sponsorship of organization events like AIGA or TDC.  You don't see type ads placed with broad market strategies in Newsweek or Fortune.  Adobe most likely places ads for their products with broader market appeal, like Acrobat, in many more venues than its type collection.  Type houses are smart buniness men/women for the most part.  They know who the gatekeepers are and would not waste money placing ads in unproductive markets.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bitstreams clones are not illegal! In the 1980s, Bitstream licensed the entire Linotype library for sale. However, their agreement with Linotype only allowed them to sell the designs, not the names themselves. So, Bitstream had to come up with its own naming system. Swiss and Helvetica were therefore the same design, just with different names. This was not illegal or immoral at all. Linotype, and its designers, got paid. Since then, Bitstream has gotten a different license, which also allows them to name the Linotype fonts correctly. (I think that this is all true) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant could perhaps make legal Poppl revivals. As most of us know, only Typeface names (and their digital outlines) are trademarkable, except in Germany. In Germany, the DESIGN of a font is also protected by a patent, as long as that patent has been officially registered in Germany. These design patents expire after 25 year, and can never be renewed. The names and the outlines can be renewed, though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, if Hrant makes new drawings based off of a Poppl design that is over 25 years old, doesn't reference Berthold's actual files, and names it something totally different, he could legally sell that font as a revival. He could also patent the font and its design in Germany, and have the legal protection of thh German courts behind him when Berthold eventually would sue. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But that would be a suit that Berthold would lose, in any court, anywhere. That would be a fun day.</div>

The top 2 (Imago &amp; Formata) are Berthold fonts under the &quot;Exclusiv&quot; label but in the Adobe collection.  The Walbaum does not have the &quot;Exclusiv&quot; designation, only Adobe (it may be that it is just older).  I include the Adobe Caslon as an example of typical Adobe labeling as a comparison. I also have Baskerville, AG, and BE Garamond on TOC but have purchased nothing else of Berthold since.

		<div class="commentbody">Your history is selective, and in places revisionist. And this isn't about companies stealing fonts from each other, it's about corporations intimidating individuals. You're just using Bitstream as an excuse to justify [other] bad behavior, to distract*. And speaking of &quot;relative ethics&quot;, when William Garth of Compugraphic was asked how the newly formed company would build a font library, he replied &quot;in the usual manner&quot;**, which basically meant swiping - but the point is that so many companies did that (including ATF, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Enschede<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and so many more), people -unfortunately- mind it less. What people are complaining about in this thread is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bullying<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and to many of us that's a greater violation of the social fabric. Focus, please. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* And/or maybe vent (see below). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->** See the Romano article in issue #46 of APHA. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Again, to re-focus: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I haven't seen anyone claim they broke any laws. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What you have to get is that this is not about legality, but ethics. Sometimes you seem to get that important distinction, but when it's convenient you squirm around it. Which of course is typical of anonymous participants, since they have nothing to loose. On the other hand, as long as somebody like me is around, they still won't get away with the spin, so the best way to describe your participation here is &quot;venting&quot;.

		<div class="commentbody">From a practical perspective, it makes sense for the small business to avoid litigation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So the best strategy for a foundry is to give its fonts made-up names, or really obscure names (eg Mrs Eaves &ndash; although that is kinda like Mr Stinky). I'm surprised we don't see more typefaces with Autechre/AphexTwin music-title kind of names. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One doesn't have to be bullied to be intimidated. To my mind, Apple and Adobe's font bundling practice is no different than what the EU recently fined Microsoft for, and an absolutely massive suppression of the market for fonts, both prosumer and professional. But it's unlikely that any government is going to go after a company for dumping fonts. I mean, it's only fonts, duh. And I'm certainly not going to sue them!  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for Bitstream's marketing clout, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I know from personal experience that big CD collections of legacy and back catalogue fonts reduce the need for companies to buy fresh fonts. Many times I've had art directors say &quot;Sorry Nick, I recommended your typeface, used it in a comp, even, but they have the Adobe/Bitstream collection, and want to use something similar from that&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I'm 100% behind Bitstream's initiative of including a &quot;sampler&quot; of fonts from a variety of independent foundries, as part of the Type Odyssey CD, and glad to be represented.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bitstream is certainly worthy of discussion - but in a thread of it's own. This thread is generally about Berthold Types tactics that some have serious issues with. If it's kept on task and civil, then we can reasonably continue to expect input from all sides from the Hunt's to the Boton's and the Spiekerman's. When the discussion is kept civil, I strongly believe that a broader scope of participants will engage. And that will make a thread like this much more educational as opposed to polarizing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's tricky to keep it on the subject for sure, but vitally important for the value of a reasonably objective overview of the full story. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As one example, I for one would still like to know (from either the Hunt's or a first-hand source) if Gertrude Poppl made an agreement for the Poppl types that Berthold now distributes - including Nero. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As another example, I would like to know why the Hunt's registered the trademark for the name &quot;Renner&quot; having to do with typefaces (and subsequently let the trademark lapse a few years later).</div>

Bitstream, and its licensing stories have been discussed many times on this forum. Even if they are guilty of piracy in the past, which I don't believe, they are certainly clean now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Berthold, which was once very clean, is now very dirty, as exemplified by the first thread in this discussion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At least I have the decency to post under my real name when I make controversial statements such as the ones above. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant, I would like to know the answers to your two questions, too. However, you know that Mr. Hunt won't answer them. Especially question number two&hellip; no foundry is going to tell you the exact number of cease and desist letters taht they have sent out. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And Bouncer, this doesn't justify Berthold's actions one bit. If FSI, Linotype, Bitsream, et al. sent out as many questionable letters as Berthold had, we'd all know about it. Those storeis would show up here, too, and they haven't. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lastly, Hrant, I know that you are afraid of American lawyers, but they aren't all bad. In the example I used before, about legit revivals, the ficticious designer in question would have nothing to fear. Some lawyers do go over the top in litigation, but sometimes the law is chrystal clear. In the case of type, there are so few laws that it would be asy to rest assured knowing that a certain party would be right in a certain case.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;1) That Berthold is not necessarily at fault here in any way&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I never wrote that. What I wrote was that if you want to criticise them do so for stealing the designs of others - don't do so for sending out cease and desist letters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if you're going to do it then take into account what others do - ie Bitstream and Agfa&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you go back to the comments that started this thread you'll see that even Erik Spiekermann - who has more to complain about than most others here - said that Berthold are entitled to protect their trademarks. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;2) That the real intention of your posts are to bring  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;closure and/or abandonment to an issue that you do not  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;want to see discussed further (especially by Hrant). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not at all, I just see no logic in demanding answers when it is reasonably clear that you won't get them. Additionally it's still not altogether clear to me *what* this thread is about. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It starts with Hunt responding to Spiekermann's allegations - someone (smart person) calls Spiekermann a liar (good move I think!). Some points are clarified, many are not. Read between the lines and you have the answers: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Berthold pays some of its &quot;designers&quot; - these are people who are engaged in revivals of their own work or extensions of the same. Berthold has no choice but to pay them because they wouldn't do the &quot;new&quot; work otherwise. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Therefore it is obvious that those that are not named are not getting paid - because the &quot;spin control&quot; would seek to neutralise all the criticism that it can. It can't, QED. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Bouncer, I find it strange that you are so quick to forgive  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Berthold, yet you will demonize Bitsttream <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I never forgave Berthold, nowhere in this thread. And what Bitstream did in terms of design theft was much worse than Berthold. It's easy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Even if they are guilty of piracy in the past, which  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;I don't believe, they are certainly clean now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What do you mean you don't believe!? Bitstream stole all of Linotype's designs, renamed them and sold them for years and years - there was no deal with Linotype that allowed them to do this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Please, show us some evidence to back up your claim? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The reason all the names were changed was because otherwise it would infringe the trademark, the only protection available to Linotype in the USA. IE Bitstream relied on the law rather than ethics. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe you are confusing this issue with that of URW - which is similar, but quite different. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;At least I have the decency to post under my real name  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;when I make controversial statements such as the ones above. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Great, you can use your &quot;real name&quot; to perpetuate lies, and I can't use a nick to tell the truth. Justice! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Those storeis would show up here, too, and they haven't.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, because this is the font of all knowledge.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Back to the intital issue (i only read these posting once a week). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. The case between FSI and HH ended in a compromise after so much money was spent that FSI couldn't go on. Which is the purpose of starting all these suits in Illinois. And Mrs H being a lawyer sure helps keep the expenses down for them. Mr H says that designers were paid as the result of the compromise. They were, but only by FSI. H kept all the money he had taken for the sales of FontFonts when the franchise agreement was terminated because of some technical clause particular to Illinois law. I never understood how a court could make a contract void but let  one of the 2 parties keep the proceeds from a void deal. But then i am not a lawyer and operate under the simple premise that designers should get paid by whoever gets proceeds from selling their fonts. I am expecting another letter from Chicago because i wasn't supposed to discuss this in public, ever. But i can let H know already that i'll ignore whatever comes from him. He'll have to send the sheriffs over to get anything out of me. Or the Marine Corps. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. If Getraude Popple (Friedrich Poppl's widow) spoke english, i'd get her to write her version of the dealings with H. She never signed a contract because she couldn't agree with the conditions. So Poppl's fonts are sold without a contract, illegally. She hasn't got the means to pursue the matter, and H knows this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are lots of other stories to be told about H's behaviour and attitude towards our business. The one thing i can mention is the news that got all this started: if someone tries to prevent another foundry from using the word &quot;Grotesk&quot; or &quot;Grotesque&quot; in a typeface name, that person is not out to protect a tradename, but to harrass the competition. If he hadn't lost that one, the next step could have been sueing anybody who used Sans or Serif or Antiqua, as all these are part of some Berthold trademark or other. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. Just the fact that no typedesigner outside a small bunch of people who used to work for Berthold will work for them should be enough to tell the rest of the community (or call it business) what their practices are. They all know more than can be told here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. A lof of people think that B in Chicago is not a legal successor. H writes: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;The acquisition of the designs and trademarks was recognized by the German Patent and Trademark Office as well as by WIPO, which authorities recorded the assignments. In that regard, Berthold Types Limited acquired the Type Assets and thereby is also the legal successor to H. Berthold AG. &lt; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is a very clever way of making something sound logical and obvious, but it isn't. A new company having acquired the assets of an old company doesn't make the new company the legal successor, it just makes it the owner of the assets. If they honoured the old contracts, one might be more inclined to believe that argument. But when it comes to paying old dues and debts, the new company conveniently seems to have no connections with its predecessor. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Intimidation and bullying is their game, as simple as that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">My final post to this thread (in case anybody is still interested in the *real* topic): <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are obviously different ways of presenting the truth. While i know that there is more to this than Mr Hunt states, i cannot present any real figures and facts without entering a very libelous area. Suffice to say that dealing with someone who sees people in this business not as partners but as potential enemies has cost other parties dearly, mainly in lawyers' fees (BTW: his wife, Melissa, is a lawyer). Thus, with Mr Hunt's history of sueing everybody who has an opinion in the typographic world, i would be a fool to carry on. By now, everybody on this forum will have formed their own opinion.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let's go back to where this thread started: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We all agree that tradenames need protection against rip-off artists, and  that our libraries need to be protected against pirates. We also seem to agree that it is at least frivolous if not downright petty and vindictive when foundries get pursued for using generic terms like &quot;Grotesk&quot; in naming their fonts. We probably also agree that the type-buying public can differentiate between a name like Signa and one like Signata, especially if the typefaces involved look totally different from each other. And finally we agree that designers should be paid properly for their work through contracts that are fair and easy to understand. The fact that numerous well-known designers have chosen not to enter into contractual agreements with the self-declared Berthold successor in Chicago speaks for itself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Private business has nothing to do with this issue. There are many designers out there who know what i am not allowed to talk about as they have been party to the history of this conflict. They know my reputation and they know what the people in Chicago stand for. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Judge for yourselves.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Erik, you clearly have no clue about trademarks and the value it would bring the type industry if only members of the type industry bothered to educate themselves. Although there are more and more type designers who read Typophile that are registering their trademarks, I am always amazed at how often Typophile posts include incorrect or inaccurate information regarding trademarks.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For example, you say that you have no problem with FF UNITE so long as the design is not the same as FF UNIT. You are doing yourself, your business and the type industry a serious disservice with this position.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If a designer created a typeface called HELVETICAR or HELVETICAL, Linotype certainly would have a serious problem with that designer regardless of whether the design looked like HELVETICA. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trademark law is intended to give a exclusivity to the first company/person who registers (or in the U.S. first peron who uses) a particular trademark in connection with PARTICULAR GOODS. The goods in our industry are FONTS; for purposes of trademark law, there is no distinction between the design of one font versus the design of another font: the registered trademark applies to all fonts (not a particular font design). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For this reason, the US trademark office refused FSI's application for SIGNA citing Berthold's SIGNATA as a barrier. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->After the Barmeno/FF New Barmen fiasco which you started, FSI is now held to a higher standard not to come anywhere close to the Berthold trademarks. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If, at the time, Berthold was not trying to cause FSI &amp; its FontShop Network to stop selling counterfeit Berthold fonts offered by BSK/Babylon Schrift Kontor, there is no way we would have ever allowed FSI to continue using the name FF SIGNA. Business disputes require compromise so we compromised.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trademark law also does not require that the infringer use the EXACT trademark. The US requires only that the mark be &quot;confusingly similar&quot; and looks at the facts and circumstances of the situation. Other jurisdictions (e.g. England) also do not require use of the EXACT trademark to find infringement.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Contrary to your apparent assumptions, the type buying public is a much broader group than type and graphic designers. Therefore the type buying public would likely have difficulty distinguishing between trademarked type names with slight differences. Also because the type buying public relies more and more on purchasing over the web without assistance from people knowledgeable about type, and because they rely on search engines (dedicated to type like MyFonts or otherwise like Google), using similar typeface names could cause confusion to buyers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FONTSHOP, THE SPIEKERMANNS AND THE DOUBLE STANDARD <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Both Gustav Jaeger and Mrs. Poppl have not signed agreements with any Berthold successor after H. Berthold AG declared bankruptcy in 1993. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Notwithstanding, in 1994 when Joan and Erik Spiekermann's FontShop were distributing the Berthold typefaces (via an agreement with Berthold Systeme), Erik produced FontBook update 2, the introduction stated <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;This shows the 1400 typefaces in the Berthold Type Library released by Berthold in Berlin, Germany.

		<div class="commentbody">It is indeed hard to figure out the initial intention of the thread. If it is bullying tactics which are harming our industry, then we feel the need to add to the topic. Designers shouldn't be put off trying to register their type names to offer some kind of protection from the law. The more pertinent problem is that very few people in our industry can afford to defend themselves in the sort of cases brought against them, many are outrageous, but to defend the accusations: reckon with 6 figure sums and twice or three times that to take it to court. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FSI like most other companies and individuals, has never been able to take the issues to a full-blown court case with a judgement when attacked, where outcomes would have quite probably been completely different. The amount of money spent on injunctions, lawyers etc. meant that we have had to withdraw and agree to settle. In this respect, bullying tactics is an apt description and seems to be a pattern. We have always had to agree to settlements in the end, no matter how long we tried to hold out. Financials aside, humans eventually run out of steam too and are beaten down. But a legal Agreement doesn't necessarily mean that parties are in agreement - it's always a pragmatic matter of &quot;do we go bankrupt defending further&quot;?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mr Hunt states: &quot;For this reason, the US trademark office refused FSI's application for SIGNA citing Berthold's SIGNATA as a barrier.&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When FSI applied to register FF Signa, the US trademark office initially turned it down on the grounds that it was similar to &quot;Signata and FF Signa&quot; (really, the name of our own font was cited against us as being similar, we have the letter!) It is very common, and has happened to FSI many times, that the initial application is turned down, especially if someone objects to its registration. You then show reasons why the name and font is different and it is then often accepted. In this case it was Berthold Types who objected and it was abandoned by FSI because Berthold Types began a long, exhausting and complicated case against FSI and FontShop Germany tying in this registration with other FontShops' selling (legal) BSK fonts along with FF CityStreetType, FF Avance and other issues.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We are still convinced that we would have succeeded in registering FF Signa and others had it not been for yet another case which cost all of FSI's financial and emotional resources.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some &quot;confusing&quot; font names could spark a whole new thread, see already, and we list a few below for interest. There are hundreds more similar names, so FSI may be forgiven for the suspicion that a certain amount of harassment is involved in their case. We feel angry and sorry for the people who have been forced to remove &quot;City&quot; from their font names. FSI were &quot;allowed&quot; in their agreement to continue to use the name FF CityStreet Type under the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->condition that it did not try to register it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Look at the first example! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joan Spiekermann and Petra Weitz, Managers FSI (FontFont library) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Badoni, Agfa  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bodoni, Linotype  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aldus, Adobe  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aldous, Agfa  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Albertus, Monotype  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Albertan, Lanston  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Albertina, Monotype  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alexa, Adobe  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alexia, Alphabets  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alexie, Linotype  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alexander, Lunchbox  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Arbiter, Berthold  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Arbitrary,</div>

I am not a lawyer, but it seems like a couple of Nick's suggestions are off base. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Huh? Not much risk in doing another Garamond or Baskerville, as long as you call it &quot;Shinn Garamond&quot; and not &quot;Adobe Garamond.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) It is not difficult to make sure that you, the designer, keep the copyright, trademark and (if any) design patent rights, and still publish through somebody else (license them to sell your font software). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'd love to get into more detail here, but that would be providing legal advice which could get me into trouble (with our own lawyers if nobody else). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regards, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

The majority of my friends and attorney worldwide came to similar opinion: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- &quot;Issuing a lawsuit, in the US, is an everyday practice, even for reasons which, in other nations, would not justify a legal action. The Berthold case is a good example of this kind of approach: the company issues a lawsuit to scare a potential competitor. Anyway, on a factual level, we have to consider this: laws are not the same in any single part of the world and it's very likely there's no way to make a US Tribunal judgement effective in Russia as well.

		<div class="commentbody">Albertan was designed by me as a private metal face for my press, Pie Tree Press. If there is any confusion about the bame being confused with Albertus or Albertina, I could care less. The type is named for my wife, Alberta who was by coincidence, born in the province of Albertan, and is thus an &quot;Albertan&quot;. When I cut the type in her honour I had no intention that it would travel outside the confines of my letterpress sanctuary (which by the hour becomes more and more attractive to me) so the name was not a matter of confusion. If I had intended from the start that the type would be sold to the outside world I would still have named it for her.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, you are either not understanding what I wrote, or not understanding trademarks. Names such as Baskerville, Garamond, Caslon, Jenson and Bodoni cannot be trademarked for typefaces. They are in the public domain. By bringing up a name such as Gill Sans, which IS a trademark, you are likely to confuse people. It is not hard to find out if a name is trademarked. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Certainly, revivals are just that, and are not as original as new designs.

		<div class="commentbody">Oh, a plague on North American PC, which will get you censored for <em>not</em> using a four-letter word! (and regarding which, see Nikki Finke's latest column in LA Weekly, which you can get off the Drudge Report) &hellip; but I ought to apologize for witlessness, because if I had my wits about me, I would have brought up my one experience with trademark infringement, i.e., when Adobe sent me a slew of threat letters warning me against using 'their trademark' and 'their typeface data' in any product of my own. Needless to say, the trademark and data they referred to were mine. I told Adobe I was using the data regardless, and if they didn't like it they could sue me. As that was some years ago and I haven't heard a word from them since, it seems clear that their threat was empty, designed merely to scare a designer whom they had treated badly. One thing I have observed: when an industry is growing, there is no litigation; when an industry is dying, there is nothing but litigation.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What effect did it have on me? I went from working on type for at least 60 hours a week, to working on type for about 60 hours a year. The advantage is that I started doing some other interesting things that were important to me; the disadvantage is that I would have preferred to work on type, but who could deal with such a poisonous environment? I didn't go into type to be reviled and sued by unspeakable persons like Adobe's Donna Kolness. I went into type to create beautiful text.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That said, I am looking at a contract from a perfectly nice foundry, but I can't yet bring myself to sign it. I fear what may follow. However, this time around, if it actually happens, I ought to have enough experience to sign a better contract. I never looked at Adobe's contract - I was too happy to have it. I trusted them implicitly, believed in their fundamental goodness.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In addition to my previous posts, following are additional points: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Berthold Exklusiv Collection was conceived by GGL about 50 years ago and completed by the time he left H. Berthold AG in 1990. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The type business was very different back then as the Berthold typefaces were specific to Berthold equipment, as was the case with Linotype and Monotype. When a designer had one of their typeface designs published by Berthold, the agreement provided that Berthold was the owner of the intellectual property rights because of the high costs of bringing a Berthold typeface to market.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The creative process of digitizing and creating the full character sets were done under GGL's supervision at the Berthold Type Atelier in Munich. In most cases only the essential characters were digitized and then the remaining characters were then created by Berthold. H. Berthold AG was always listed as co-author of the typeface designs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The font software for the Berthold Exklusiv Collection was developed by Berthold. When Berthold Types took over the library, Poppl and Jaeger insisted on renegotiating their original contracts and wanted ownership of the Berthold copyrighted font software. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Albert Boton had already made a deal with another foundry (using Berthold's copyrighted data) for the other typeface in the Berthold library and only wanted to sign an agreement with the typeface Boton and have Berthold withdraw Agora. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Berthold typeface designs can be found in the libraries of Bitstream, E+F, Linotype, Paratype, Scangraphic and URW all used without permission with no money going to Lange, other Berthold designers, or to Berthold for that matter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FF Blur is Lange's AG Old Face processed through Photoshop with the &quot;blur&quot; filter. FSI does not pay Lange royalties or Berthold for use of the data to create a derivative. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Problems with typeface names were virtually non-existant (by today's standards) until the advent of PostScript and programs like Fontographer that enabled hundreds of people to produce fonts. Berthold's trademarks have been around for decades. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With all due respect to Mr. Shipovsky (FontCity) but his Russian attorney's &quot;opinion&quot; is worthless in regard to U.S. and EU law. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, there is a co-existence agreement between Linotype and Monotype for the &quot;Times&quot; trademark and Adobe pays royalties to both companies for use of it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The fact that both companies use the &quot;Times&quot; trademark, therefore, should not be seen as the right to use other people's trademarks for new typeface names (e.g. Boogaloo Boulevard, Omicron Delta, City of &mdash; ). Boulevard and Delta have been trademarks owned by the Berthold foundry for decades.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just to take a little point here, I suspect the 'Times' trademark is not capable of being defended because of its decades-prior use by ATF, for example, as in Times Gothic, a typeface shown (but not identified) by Tracy as an example of Will Ransom's design. 'Times Roman' perhaps, but not 'Times' per se in a typeface. In fact, if anything, Mono and Lino are in violation of ATF's rights for attempting to assert trademark ownership in any typeface containing the word 'Times'. One has got oneself into a very absurd position when one is reduced to discussing what rights Lino and Mono might have in Times and whether Adobe should be paying for those rights or not.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One wonders if there has been any friction between Agfa and Berthold over the use of tradenames such as Bembo? For example, Mono made it impossible for Scangraphic to sell its versions of faces such as Bembo, Perpetua, Centaur &amp; Poliphilus on the grounds that the license was for Scangraphic's proprietary format and could not be applied to the Postscript conversions.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With all this dreadful litigation going on, we still don't have a usable digital version of Bembo. The Mono version is incorrectly designed. The Berthold version is correctly designed but only has two f-ligs, and those incorrectly designed. The illegal Scangraphic design is also correctly designed but the five f-ligs are merely generic, much like Adobe's ahistorical f-ligs for the 'expert' versions of the Berthold faces they used to license. The last thing they were was expert. I wonder what drudge designed them? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->License, license, and litigation, yak-yak, and yet nobody ever solves the problems in the fonts. As the redoubtable Ed Mendelsohn said years ago, 'I would pay good money for a usable version of Bembo, and this despite the fact that I have two children to educate.' <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Harvey, the last time I saw you your jaw had fallen and you couldn't get it up. Is it now in working order?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A superficial glance reveals that if Brody used someone else's underlying font, it probably wasn't AG or AG Old Face but more likely one with a more open C. Harvey, do you have any proof N Brody did this? I'm open to persuasion but I'll require proof. That takes care of the first issue: did he do it? The second issue is, what does it matter? (In this particular case, that is, for a dozen obvious reasons.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And by the way, if you were going to use the PS Blur filter, why on earth would you bother to use a vector font as your input? You could use a scan of anything - that would be the obvious thing to do. For the moment you'll have to count me amongst the rude unpersuaded. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And by the way, suppose Brody didn't use vector data, but used a scan from some old specimen book. Would you still have an issue with that?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's another question: to what extent is Concorde a Times clone? As I understand the story, it was intended as a Times clone, even though it doesn't really look like one. But in intent, it is, to a certain extent, a Times clone. Does anyone have an issue with that?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And what about that version of AG that actually is a Helvetica clone? Is Berthold expected to pay Lino, or the estate of Max Miedinger, royalties on that?</div>
