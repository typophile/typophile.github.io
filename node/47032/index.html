  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there!
I&rsquo;m doing a type, just for fun using the word &ldquo;typoholic&rdquo;
I need critiqs. As you can see i&rsquo;m not happy with &ldquo;oho&rdquo; i tried to make a ligature with it but didn&rsquo;t liked it. I&rsquo;m drawing this without much knowledge of calligraphy. I&rsquo;m using the 45º degree scratch technique to draw and get the relation of the thin strokes with the strong ones.</div>

I am a fan of enthusiasm and do not condemn you for trying, but I think it is imperative, if you wish for this to look very good, to spend more time gaining more knowledge of calligraphy and working with nibs. Why not? You&rsquo;re bound to enjoy it, and it is the most fundamental step you could take to gain a better understanding of how to do what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</div>

@jazzhustler - i already thought about that, the ligature isn&rsquo;t working as i expected and it comes from the initial idea of ligature all the text but yes, maybe i&rsquo;ll separate them
@koppa - i already ordered some books of calligraphy, i don&rsquo;t have much knowledge but i do have some, i had one year of typography studies some knowledge i do have or else i couldn&rsquo;t do anything and i wouldn&rsquo;t know the 45º technique&hellip; In my way of seeing, knowledge comes with books and so but it comes with experience too! For example, i think i improved from the first sketch to this second one&hellip;</p>

@dtw - you gave me an idea with that sharp angle, never thought of it. about the loop, tried, doesn&rsquo;t work but&hellip; i found another solution when i broke L and I ligature, so lets see what you think.</p>
<p>Still have to angle that second part of the H, there are some issues about weight of stroke but that can be easily solved when passing to the fontlab. I don&rsquo;t know about that T.
I feel other thing&hellip; it isnt&hellip; smooth, soft and sensual &hellip; like it wasnt a custom type! maybe more swashes or something, maybe swashes on H and L &hellip; what do you have to tell me on this?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Joel,
You are well on your way.
The idea (presumably your belief) that you&rsquo;ll somehow get it right once you&rsquo;re working with beziers instead of ink and paper will disolve within an hour of working with beziers. You must understand what&rsquo;s happening right in front of you (on paper) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you must understand bezier curves, which takes time, before the two will come together and work for you.
On critiquing: You&rsquo;ve put up a rough for critique. I suggest you self critique until you feel like you&rsquo;ve arrived at a finished product, and then turn it in for review. Learning to self critique forces you to be more honest with yourself as a designer. Waiting until you&rsquo;ve concluded the design before seeking the review of your peers ups the risk of damage to your ego considerably, is more rewarding to us, and ultimately is more rewarding to you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You’re overdoing it with the swashes and creating hot spots, tension points, and odd counter spaces—I’ve picked out a few in the image below. Try starting over with simple short swashes and then figure out how build knots that form pleasing shapes without distracting from the types. And keep the integrity of the letterforms in mind. When you start breaking entire stems into swashes, or using different styles of serif in a single word, the piece comes apart. For example, is that h or an n with a huge swash?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">hmm i think the l flourish is a bit too overdone and the bottom ones aren&rsquo;t quite picturesque. I like the &ldquo;restraint&rdquo; version but it doesn&rsquo;t have as much impact. If you wish to look more like Hydro&rsquo;s work perhaps a more outlandish approach and more concept work needs to be done. I do like the improvements and seeing the progression!</div>

What do you mean by &ldquo;outlandish approach&rdquo; ?</p>
<p>I would like to show you some impact flourish that i&rsquo;m thinking of but I don&rsquo;t know much about names. The portuguese Andrade de Figueiredo (i&rsquo;m portuguese too) has some beautiful flourish on something he made on the year 1722 which i provided here with a scan from a book i have but i still want more reference of this kind of flourish. As i said i want to impact people nos just typeface designers and interested on type but all the people.
I dont want to florish the letters like on the image but maybe use that florish on other ways, the ways i&rsquo;m trying to get on Y and I.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I admire your perseverance and sticking power but on looking at your roughs it appears to me that when you draw or sketch your letters you may not be giving enough attention to the white spaces. I have always believed that when working black on white it is the white background within and outside the letters that we really see not the letters. It is an elusion at its best. Light falls on the sheet but it is the light off the white that reflects to the eye. The black (that is, the letters or type) blocks out the white and they are revealed by the white within and around them. If the white shapes are wrong and miss understood then the shape of the letters and the flourishes will be totally wrong.
I appreciate that as a left hander, writing with a nib can be both difficult and frustrating for you, but if you want  flow and rhythm and understanding in your italics and flourishes then you have no option but to persevere with it. You don&rsquo;t have to become an excellent calligrapher, but you must have an understanding of the principles, and appreciate how the thick and thin works, otherwise you will be clutching in the dark an will never really solve the problems by just producing sketch after sketch.
I hope the following suggestion will help you to some extent.
Get the longest board you can manage to place on your lap and place it against a table (If you have a large drawing board at a steep angle, even better). Attach two 2b pencils together with an elastic band and make sure that the point of the left hand pencil is lower than the right hand one. Then try writing or constructing the letters with paper placed as far to your left as you possibly can.
This will help you to hold the pencils at a steeper angle. I know that you will not see the letters as well as you would like, but the shapes you will produce , depending on your skill and how consistent you maintain the angle, might give you some idea of how the thick and thin works. You can experiment with the angle by adjusting the pencils with the elastic band. See what happens by having the left pencil higher and lower. I think you will have some exciting revelations.</p>

i really understand you the white spaces are always important but yes, i take very few attention to it.
i think i&rsquo;ll try to do that that you said, like a monk ehehe&hellip;
maybe tomorrow i&rsquo;ll have something already. i&rsquo;ll try to make florish and something too.
thanks for the patience!</p>

<p>Practice! I spent about a year drawing letters with every pen, marker, and brush I owned before I started drawing type with a computer. I still can’t draw well, but what I learned about letter construction is invaluable.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->i really understand you the white spaces are always important but yes, i take very few attention to it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Try drawing trees, but only draw the space around the trees and in-between the branches. You will learn to appreciate the white spaces rather fast.</p>

i draw everyday for about 3 years already&hellip; i&rsquo;ve been on arts already! the problem is the position of the hand as Ieuan understood!
It&rsquo;s really difficult for a left-handed try to use a ArtPen it even hurts my wrist! That&rsquo;s why i can&rsquo;t draw, i can&rsquo;t draw on that position. It will always be rough because my hand and wrist are in total tension.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done that already (draw trees) as i said already been in arts and even on my Communication Design degree (that i&rsquo;m studying) i have a class called &ldquo;Drawing&rdquo; and already drew there &ldquo;white spaces&rdquo; like&hellip; drawing by the negatives and then i had classes with Dino dos Santos and he loves white-spaces too so&hellip; i&rsquo;ve been a little influenced by him too but sometimes&hellip; i forget about it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok after some drawings i started to get somewhere! At start i was doing some sketches a little too gothic with a lot of angles and so. At this &ldquo;final&rdquo; i already went with some smoother lines. Still there are some problems like the size of the ascendents as it is possible to see on the T, spacing and maybe if descendents were bigger it wouldn&rsquo;t be bad. Forget about the ligature from T to H, just trying. One thing that i really have to rethink is that T, i have an idea that i already sketched but i&rsquo;m waiting for your opinion to start the new drawing.</p>
<p>Ieuan told me to use 2b pencils but&hellip; they were pissing me off so i started use some markers and the paper is A2. I left the swashes/ligatures with a lighter color because they are kind of try outs!</p>

Then there is another issue, you didn&rsquo;t draw the middle letters (i&rsquo;m not saying for you to draw cause you already are having a lot of patience) so we can&rsquo;t see how Y and P acts for example and i think that as someone said here before, it would make tension on that cross!

If you could, lighten the connection a little more, so the form of the &ldquo;c&rdquo; is not at all misconstrued for an &ldquo;s&rdquo;. You may also want to try VERY delicately attaching it to the upper terminal of the &ldquo;c&rdquo;, and have it branch down and around to create the flourish below (and as it did so, the line would become gradually thicker). This could be tricky. The other option of course is using the lower portion of the &ldquo;l&rdquo; stem as the parent to that lower flourish, instead of the &ldquo;c&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Okay. I see what your concern about creating an &ldquo;o&rdquo; shape, but if this loop is far enough away from the baseline of the text, this should not be a problem. But you don&rsquo;t HAVE to have an ostensible loop.</p>
<p>Continue to work that &ldquo;T&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;y&rdquo;, you can probably make it flow.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you do want to continue experimenting with this sort of lettering, I would recommend getting a regular nib point (non-scrolled: &ldquo;scrolled&rdquo; meaning it produces more than one line per stroke).  My calligraphy teacher favored the Brause brand nibs, a little harder to find, but better.</p>
<p>Your patience is definitely paying off!</p>

<p>About nib, i have an artpen with 2.7mm but there is one problem, i&rsquo;m left-handed. For left-handed those are stuff very hard to use because they only write in one way! So it&rsquo;s really hard to write with it.</p>
<p>Again, your patience is something&hellip; ehehe. Before your post i was thinking about something like the third one but now that i see&hellip; Maybe the forth solution isnt bad at all. I thought it would be worse. First solution i don&rsquo;t like, second i think it won&rsquo;t be good for composition. I&rsquo;ll try third and forth solution.</p>
<p>Again thanks a lot for your patience then i offer you a t-shirt ehehe.</p>

<p>What I like to see in this kind of project is an encapsulated word, which given time I am sure you will/would achieve.</p>
<p>This was done quickly based on what you have digitized (already) but redistributing the flourishes and done with a calligraphic marker. Sorry about the quality but my scanner, printer and workhorse computer are out of commission for another week.</p>
<p>What I have seen from the beginning is a disconnect between the tool and your forms (hence my comment way back in the thread). The entry/exit strokes of the i do not match the flourishes. Same with the exit strokes of the T and the h. The terminals of the l and h flourish leave me hanging, if you would have had a chisel edged pen in your hand I am sure the blunt end would have trailed off more gently.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. Your struggle has brought you quite a distance.</p>
<p>Mine is my take (and may not be to your liking and 1 of 1000&rsquo;s of solutions) and you may want something totally different.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Iffy! (about the &ldquo;y&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I think if you wanted that &ldquo;y&rdquo; to be more in line with the rest of the characters, you might consider this:</p>
<p>Rotating the main body of the &ldquo;y&rdquo; (where the arm and stem converge into the &ldquo;v&rdquo;-type shape) clockwise about 35-45 degrees, then adjust the arm according to how it would look best.</p>
<p>Even though all your x-heights of your letters may match, both the stem and arm of the &ldquo;y&rdquo; are pointing in the direction opposite of the slant of the other characters (these point left, while the main slant points slightly to the right). So this is probably making it appear to be of a smaller size. Also the upper stem of the &ldquo;y&rdquo; arching up exaggerates the illusion of the arm being even shorter than what it really is (don&rsquo;t change the &ldquo;y&rdquo; -to- &ldquo;T&rdquo; connection you have established though). I think adjusting this &ldquo;y&rdquo; so that its' stem flows with the slant of the other characters will fix this optical illusion.</p>

<p>(I am in a big hurry today, so forgive the fact that it&rsquo;s not so precise and also scanned in crooked). This is just to give you an idea.</p>
<p>See how most all the characters lean slightly to the right, and that both the stem AND arm of the &ldquo;y&rdquo; point left. I think you should at least adjust the stem of the &ldquo;y&rdquo; so it has the same slant as the rest of the characters.</p>
<p>Now for the arm, you could leave it as is, or square it off and match it&rsquo;s slant too. Up to you&hellip;</p>

<p>A second option is the fountain-pen style, that uses an internal ink cartridge. Here is a link for these sorts of pens for left-handed calligraphers:</p>

– turn the page 90 degrees clockwise, write from top to bottom (as advised by Gerrit Noordzij)
– flip the writing process, write from right to left (the Da Vinci method :-)</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/turnwrite_3607.jpg] [img:sites/default/files/old-images/flipwrite_5065.jpg]
both methods usually take some hours or days to get used to,

<p>I saw your work in the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a Calligrapher&rdquo; thread, and it looked precisely like the writing Freeza had requested. How long have you been practicing calligraphy? Are you self-taught and/or have you had lessons?</p>

Well that&rsquo;s a bit crazy because&hellip; i think you see that&rsquo;s crazy! lol if i do the first method i don&rsquo;t have the perception of baseline and so on and on.
on the second method&hellip; ham&hellip; i always writed from left to right.
Still wondering about that pen.
But, even being crazy, i can try! and i will.</p>
<p>Other thing&hellip; for the da vinci method you use a mirror? or just do that &ldquo;blinded&rdquo;?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>marz, as a calligrapher i am self taught. 
initially, i just made my way through writing history from Capitalis Quadrata, Rustica, Uncialis … up to 18th century flex-nib writing. that took me several months.</p>
<p>youremin, i know it sounds crazy, but it works – at least for my students. 
(i am right handed myself, and i have to confess: the images above are mockups just to demonstrate what a mean)
you don’t need a mirror for the &ldquo;Da Vinci method&rdquo;. in fact it would only make things more complicated. but if you have some reference you are working from, it helps to scan it and flip it in Photoshop. to check your flipped writing just hold it against the window and look at it from the backside.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i tried both techniques the 90º technique is the best drawn, even though is kind of hard to draw well.
crazy techniques. anyway there is other way to do this with an artpen for right handed. it is too cross the hand and write with the hand upside down. how can i explain this, your hand is above the draw with the pen pointed down. i think there is more control than on other techniques, takes time to draw, sometimes we have to remember the position, sometimes the ink fail but &hellip; it draws better than on other techniques, i guess. still&hellip; want to buy a left-handed pen&hellip;. so it can be easier and so on and on.</p>

[[http://www.lamy.com/eng/b2c/AL-star%20silverblue/027]] that has left-handed version.
And on other pens i find oblique version, i don&rsquo;t know if it works but i&rsquo;ll try on some store or so to see if the oblique works for left-handed.</p>

<p>For those who have a lamy, maybe you can help, i&rsquo;m wondering how is the Safari, it seems very nice on critiqs and on reviews! I would like to know too how are the nibs and so&hellip; can i use a oblique? i don&rsquo;t know which nibs are appropriate to left-handed&hellip; will it work just fine with the regulars?</p>
