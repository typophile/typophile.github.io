body: "This subject, \"desktop publishing,\" has been discussed many times before
  but I am curious about the reactions graphic designers and/or font designers have
  had to the advent of technology driven design. Has it been good or bad for design,
  has it allowed a lot of mediocre \"artists\" to contribute to the field whereas
  previously they would never have had an interest in the black art of design? Much
  has happened since I saw an article I think in Publish magazine about the postscript
  printer, the gist of which was how it would change the graphics field forever. Has
  the introduction of publishing and designing software like PageMaker, Quark, Illustrator,
  Fontographer, etc., had an influence on the democratization of design? Obviously
  yes, but for good or bad? Now that design is accessible to everyone with a computer
  and the cash to buy the software can't everybody be a designer as I believe Rudy
  Vanderlans declared in an issue of Emigre? And if so what does this mean?\r\n\r\nJordan

    I would suspect that is the case.\r\n\r\nFor good or bad I think it's fine that
    people are empowered. Just like the fact that lots of folks now have recording
    studios in their homes. Has it made music better? Definitely not, but the fact
    that they are empowered is a good thing. It has taken it out of the hands of the
    record companies, who used to be the only ones who could afford to produce records.\r\n\r\nI
    think the worse side effect is what it's done to the decision making process.
    Changes are so easy to make now that decisions have been trivialized and end up
    getting made by the bosses wife\u2026 :)\r\n\r\npeace"

  body: "I'm a desktop publisher myself, but still I think through desktop publishing
    a lot of non-designers have found their way to a job they otherwise never would've
    considered. Still, I'm quite happy with my job as a simple desktop publisher &
    have no (more) intentions of persuing a job as a designer. The mayor difference
    between the 2 is probably the paycheck. I'm quite happy doing dull things for
    work in programs I love working with (nothing beats Illustrator in my opinion)
    & I can still use my creativity in my spare time. The advantage to that is that
    you never have to compromise (something that I've never been good at when it comes
    to my drawings). To be a good designer you need to be creative & able to make
    sacrifices to your own dislikings. Even in my job as a desktop publisher I've
    sometimes had the opportunity to create a logo for a local company, but I quickly
    realized that 9 times out of 10 the client will opt for the ugliest logo (or even
    worse: they come up with their own handdrawn logo you have to digitilize with
    so called \"original\" ideas; I once had to do a logo for a local tanning centre
    called \"casa del sol\" & they had the brilliant idea of making a sun of the \"o\"
    from sol). Sure the introduction of desktop publishing has left the gates open
    for a lot of inadequates to oppose themselves as designers, but on the brighter
    side, it probably makes designers more competative to proof their superiority.
    It's a knive that cuts both ways & in my case it made me realize that I'd rather
    keep my dull job and save my creativity for personal use; no compromises whatsoever.
    Even if I end up not using it for anything, I'll still have the pleasure of looking
    at the result knowing it's exactly how I wanted it to be. There have been a few
    interesting threads last week about designers vs. non-designers which you might
    enjoy reading as well.\r\nI'll post the links later on."

  body: I think we already "met" in the "design limbo thread", Paul, didn't we? I
    was the first one there to advice the poster to stick to his dull job & save his
    creativity for personal use & thought I was going to get a lot a critique on that,
    but surprisingly a lot of people backed me up on that (including you). Thanks
    for backing me up here again ;-) I've had discussions with a few friends lately
    who feel I should do something with my drawings ("it's such a shame of talent,
    yada yada yada...") & I simply can not seem to explain to them how I feel about
    my work & I'm so excited that in the same week I found a whole group of people
    here who understand where I'm coming from & actually share my thoughts on this.
    I can't begin to tell you how grateful I am to have found kindred spirits. We're
    a rare breed, but thanks to specialized sites, we can talk freely about our passions
    without the risk of being misunderstood or being found a little unrealistic (in
    being too idealistic) or even immature. Typophile is my sacred site!

  body: Thanks for the links Tom to past threads. Interesting that some or many like
    the idea of separating their professional work from the personal work. What is
    professional seems to be work which is dull but pays the bills and ultimately
    not very rewarding. I tend to share that view. And yes, everybody can be a designer.
    But there are good designers and not so good designers and on occasion great ones.
    I like the astute comment regarding being empowered. On many levels having the
    chance to try, to be empowered, is crucial in the sense that more people than
    previously will have the opportunity to do something that might not have done
    before. And I think that is very good.

  body: "The DTP revolution also empowered good designers to be able to have many
    options opened to them and ways to control their design far better than any time
    in history. There have always been bad users of every tool ever made. We can never
    stop a page butcher, we can only strive to make our own work at a high enough
    level that our labors succeed in improving the visual landscape (whie the garbage
    ends up in the visual landfill). It is not up to good designers to place an electrified
    fence around our tools that prevents those without design skills from having the
    freedom to try. It is not our job either to point and hiss at the unskilled. It
    is our job to do the best work we can with whatever tools we have. The door was
    opened to everyone in 1984. There has been more very good design done since then
    and more very bad design done since then. It was 1984, but we do not have to become
    \"Big Brother\" and watch over all.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "As for Chris's comment, I started drawing as soon as I could hold a pencil
    in my hand & never stopped until I actually went to art school after graduating
    from high school. I had real high hopes about it, but pretty much everything about
    it disappointed me. It seemed to me that they focused too much on technique rather
    than the results, eg. for model drawing we h\xE0d to draw guidelines (which I
    never did 'cause I'd be too misled by them and ended up with a completely deformed
    model) & I just added them at the end just so I wouldn't get any comment on it.
    They also actually forbade me to use squared paper for sketching (which I've always
    prefered and still do) because -occording to them- it would inhibite me in my
    designs. Art school teachers should be openminded about different techniques &
    preferences as long as the results are just as good, but most of my teachers were
    too hung up on their approaches. Maybe art school teachers are what music critics
    are for the music industries (failed musicians/artists)? After a while I heard
    about a DTP-course and in that I refound my joy of drawing. To this day, I still
    don't draw manually anymore (only to make quick sketches) even though I practically
    spent 20 years of my life doing so.\r\nIn desktop publishing, I found a new way
    to express my creativity & found a job that comes somewhat close to that, but
    is different enough from it so I don't run the risk of losing the joy in my personal
    work again."

  body: "It's given designers much more control than they had before, but in many
    cases more control than they wanted. Designers are now expected to know how to
    set type, where before that was left to typesetting experts. Whether this is liberating
    or a burden depends on how much control you desire.\r\n\r\nIt's also compressed
    job turn around times to nearly nothing. The idea of getting copy from a client
    and have a finished design on press a few hours later would have been unimaginable.
    Unfortunately, this increase in production speed has not necessarily given designers
    more time to work, it has more often allowed people earlier in the production
    process to start later. (I have seen this happen over and over any time I've figured
    out a faster way to do something--an in-house stat camera, using FedEx, etc.)\r\n\r\nOne
    other thing: You never have to worry about making things square. In fact, it requires
    extra effort to make things crooked. The opposite used to be the case with paste
    ups and mechanicals."

    and others started selling typesetting machines based on the idea that \"a secretary\"
    can set the type now. Of course, the people who bought the machines found that
    the \"secretary\" had to be trained to the point where she was a typographer,
    not a secretary, and was no longer willing to work for secretarial wages.\r\n\r\nDTP
    is just the newest tool. It (fortunately) does not confer skill or talent on the
    user. Heck, now you can design type with a $600 piece of software. That doesn't
    mean that the type will be good."

  body: Actually Don Type Tool 3 is a great tool for $99. Whether one uses TT3 or
    FontLab Studio or Fontographer or all 3 (I do) doesn't matter one bit when it
    comes to the quality of the font. Good design will always be good whether or not
    one uses whatever tool. In fact, a good friend works for a fancy New York firm
    and doesn't use a computer. He is still a real art director. i.e., he directs
    the staff on what to produce as a final result and that staff does whatever they
    do to achieve that end using whatever tools they have to work with. Of course
    this is probably a bit unusual but it does happen.
