body: "A friend asked me if I knew where to find ITC Grouch, but I found out that
  that font is not available for lisencing due to some dispute, between Bitstream
  and Monotype, I believe. But after some months that Herb Lubalin design just creeped
  back into my head, so I had to do my take on it.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grumpy_5078.png]\r\nWhat
  do you think? It's heavier than Grouch, and proportions differ as well from the
  original. But I'm pretty happy with the counter forms.\r\n"

  body: "I do think there's demand for this type of font.\r\nLetters that are working
    especially well to my eye include /S/A/q/e/v/\r\nI'd consider raising /G/'s crossbar,
    or dropping/enlarging the top serif, to close the aperture.\r\nLower counter of
    /a/ looks small and kind of sad.\r\n/x/ and /z/ are too wide.\r\n/g/ is narrow
    and light (not an easy puzzle to solve at this weight, of course). I'm not usually
    a fan of that \"Tomi g\" but it fits the style perfectly in this case, if you
    can get the weight and width to work.\r\nThat big slant of the head serifs, when
    it appears at the midline, makes letters like /u/m/p/r/ look kind of stepped-on.
    Perhaps it's just a matter of raising those stems further into the overshoot zone.\r\nDid
    you try putting the bilateral serif on the first stem of /m/ instead of the middle
    one? The one-way serifs on /h/ and /n/ work well.\r\n/s/ may be light.\r\nShould
    /R/'s leg be a little thicker?\r\nShould the crossbars of /f/ and /t/ be thickened
    a bit?\r\nMaybe add some weight to the serif of the middle arm of /E/ and /F/.\r\n/U/
    looks narrow. /Y/ looks a bit high-waisted. /N/'s diagonal needs more weight.\r\nI'm
    not sold on the /Q/'s tail.\r\nI wonder if at some point you'd want to chamfer
    those acute angles.\r\nKeep up the good work!"

    to the extreme. More extreme than in ITC Grouch. Hairline extreme. That would
    make a great stylish headline face for magazines."

    so there is still loads to tweak an re-draw. Craig, you really have a good eye
    for this. I'll work through your comments. And J\xF6rg; that is indeed something
    to think about. In fact, I think I'll go with that."

    they were a part of this Grouch-thingy to seep into my head. Thanks for that.
    I think I'll do two variants: Display and Text, and perhaps a lighter variants
    as well\u2026 "
