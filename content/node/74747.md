body: "I'm working on a multilingual identity for a conference and one of the languages
  is arabic. I have Din arabic but no idea about how to generate some arabic text
  in a programme such as freehand or illustrator - do these programmes support arabic,
  or would I need a middle eastern version? for the actual identity I need 5 words
  as vectors in the three weights of Din arabic that I have... can anyone help/advise
  me on this?\r\n\r\nthanks!"
