  body: "Frans, what\u2019s the source of this sample? Is it pre-digital?\r\nAs far
    as I can tell, all digitally available options have been named by Tamas and Jan.\r\nHere\u2019s
    a comparison \u2013 from top to bottom:\r\nURW\u2019s <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/goudy/\">Goudy</a>
    (aka WTC Goudy) with the G from the <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/goudy-wtc/\">Swash
    Italic</a>\r\nSorts Mill Goudy, with the included alternate swash G\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-goudy-oldstyle/\">LTC
    Goudy Oldstyle</a> with the G from the Cursive (there is also a \r\n<a href=\"http://www.p22.com/lanston/goudyoldstyle.html\">Pro
    version</a> with <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/lanston_type_co/ltc_goudy_oldstyle_italic_pro/&s=c\">swash
    alternates and short descenders</a>.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/goudy_3852.gif]\r\nNone
    of them is a perfect hit, but both Sorts Mill\u2019s and LTC\u2019s version bring
    you very close. The former is freely available with an Open Font License, but
    unlike LTC\u2019s, it doesn\u2019t offer the optional long descenders, and you
    can\u2019t switch on swash alternates globally.\r\nF"
