  body: "Hi Eben\r\n\r\nWell I just googled \"musee imprimerie nationale france\"
    and got <a href=\"http://www.imprimerie.lyon.fr/imprimerie/\">the local museum.</a>
    Although <a href=\"http://www.garamonpatrimoine.org/news.html\"> this alternative
    site </a> might be more interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're in Paris and you like
    votive statuary and inscriptional type, the cemetery Pere Lachaise is what we
    might call \u2019dead good'! They have a <a href=\"http://www.pere-lachaise.com/perelachaise.htm\">
    nice site </a> too."
