  \"Route\" is similar to Bpreplay: http://www.fontspace.com/backpacker/bpreplay but
  I don't think it's a perfect match.\r\n\r\nI'm stumped on \"65\" and my eyes are
  starting to bleed looking through the thousands of fonts on the various websites.\r\n\r\nI
  haven't even started on \"Pub & Grub\" as my head is going to split open any second.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone can give me at least a direction to start looking, my headache would greatly
  appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    modifying a bit the \"5\" of \r\n<strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-1&ffam=Ash%20-%20Regular&fstyle=&fsize=60&fid=4f86452be532863658d4da5ad0bcc46b&wrap=2&text=65|Ash
