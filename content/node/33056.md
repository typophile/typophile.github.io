body: "The quote is a tricky, powerful \"shape-shifter\" of a character, with abilities
  way beyond its formal uses for marking verbal expressions, titles, etc. We've all
  seen it used to mean \"not exactly\", or even \"not really, but this way you can't
  sue me\", when a product is advertised to do something it doesn't. I've also seen
  it used to mean \"not exactly but there's something to it\": during a visit to the
  Cayman Islands I saw a car rental place with a large \"JEEP ONLY\" sign, in quotes;
  it actually had other vehicles for rent too, but/so wanted to succinctly state:
  \"This is the place for renting a jeep, but we have other stuff too\"*. And during
  this past spring break I saw the quote used thus:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quotes_s_4715.jpg]\r\n_\r\nCan
  you guess what it's doing there?\r\n_\r\n* Some years later I saw a similar thing
  at a motorcycle rental place in Hawaii: \"HARLEYS ONLY\".\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nPlease
  post other example of the quote doing something\r\nbesides what it's \"supposed\"
  to. (And there it is again!)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    out in all caps, so when it came time to emphasize a word, they were stumped.
    Setting it in lower case wouldn't look right, and they didn't have a bold or italic
    font, or underlines [edit: or as hhp notes, maybe didn't think of letterspacing],
    so quote marks did the trick.\r\n\r\nSomewhat related, *certain* Typophilers use
    asterisks for emphasis -- what's with that?"

  body: "I always thought the non-sarcastic use of emphatic quotes was the punctuation-equivalent
    of a misspelling or grammatical error. However, it is so common, and not condemned
    to the same degree. Lately, I am starting to suspect that there may be something
    more historical to it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, with all the uses they already have,
    and visual similarity to primes, I think enough is enough. I am all for little
    *asterisk* stickers that I can slap over \"abused\" quotation marks.~"

    sound like anyone here has set type hand in hand with an editor - trying to meet
    deadline.\r\n\r\nA decent editor would take those quotes (I am speaking from interior
    book design) and make them <em>Italics</em> for the emphasis.\r\n\r\nRight now,
    I am laying out a story on Duesenbergs - and the author refers to them as \"Duesys\"
    (hmmm should that be Duesies?) and yes, in quotes - but when the article is published
    the readers shall see it in Italics... \r\n\r\nOr are we just picking on the word
    that's has the quotes around it...\r\n\r\nAnd I love the inch-mark remark. When
    the New York Times back in 1987 printed a full page ad - and the quote marks were
    inch marks -- everyone at TANY (remember them? Typographic Association of New
    York) commented how it was the end of the professional typesetting age... and
    yes, they were right.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I always loved the oversized quotes found
    in Zapf Dingbats - they really get the quoted message across."
