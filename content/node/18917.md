body: "Hello all. \r\n\r\nI'm currently working on an identity for an annual gala,
  for a sports organization that will be held in (southern) Sweden. The brief was
  to develop a typographical solution only (no symbols) and it had to be bold. I was
  also required to use the green that you see in the attachment (not really accurate
  when 'saved for web'. It will be more vibrant. Also, the mark would have to suitable
  for broadcasting on TV.\r\n\r\nJust to break it down, 'Malm\xF6' is a city in southern
  Sweden, and 'Galan' is - you guessed it! - swedish for gala. In english 'The Malmo
  Gala'. Not very original maybe, but I think it gets the message accross. Besides,
  I don't have any say in the actual wording. \r\n\r\nOut of the four, which works
  best?  Most of the type is custom, apart from Harlow and certain elements of Bauhaus
  93. Personally I feel that the bottom alternative has most character and would be
  most suitable. \r\n\r\nGreatful for any response.\r\n\r\nS.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/concepts.gif]"

  body: The top seems to have the most cohesive direction. Although, the tone of GALAN
    seems a little too light for the gray you've used in MALMO.

  body: 'I agree with the first comment; #1 has the best cohesive direction. You might
    want to choose a different color for the first word though and adjust the spacing.
    The two words sit closer than some letters and the kerning isn''t even across
    the board, open it up a bit and let it breathe a bit more. '

  body: "I don't understand why the cap height of the two words should be different.
    I'm afraid you need to look further at the kerning, if you take MO as a base then
    MA, AL and AN need more space. You could put in some work on the bar of the G
    and the LM and LA could do with a bit more separation to distinguish it from IM,
    IA. As a thought you could look at making MALM\xD6 in to a triline, which might
    give it a running track feel and will lighten the grey, which is still dominating
    GALAN.\r\nTim"

    I've now arranged it so they are. Also, the colour is accurate in this one. Will

  body: http://typophile.com/system/files?file=concept_01.gif -- The tones in this
    image are working for me now. The spacing isn't bad. The biggest problem for me
    is the two ligatures in the midst of all those disconnected rounds.
