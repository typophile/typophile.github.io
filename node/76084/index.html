Alas, I think they don't. Joe Public 'needs' a font, types its name into Google and finds it on one of these sites. The sites don't carry a warning or something. Joe Public thinks "hey this font stuff must be free 'cause my computer comes with a bunch of stuff installed", downloads, and goes to sleep, safe in the knowledge that if it's on the 'web, it Must Be Free.

Search this forum for posts "requesting" (actually, often more like <em>demanding</em>) a font so-and-so; read the hurt comments of the people that make fonts for a living, and followed by incredulous replies of the original posters.

I am looking at how Fakery is a screen, sort of like a mask. You are not showing the real 'you' if you hide behind a mask. I need to think of a way of exploring this message typographically..

Reminds me of something Nick touches on above: Script typefaces that pretend to be somebody's handwriting (warm, soft, personal, handmade, and all the blah that comes with that), but in fact are fonts that anyone can buy; they only pretend to be the designer's* unique, personal expression.
Things that make it obvious that what we're looking at is really a font –like repeating, identical glyphs, or connection errors– can be as jarring as realizing that this person who's been beaming a smile at you has in fact, not only fake teeth, but a rather fake face altogether. So much for masks…
(* I mean the designer using the font in this case, not the type designer.)</div>

WGBH-TV in Boston had a nice newsletter done entirely in typewriter-style type back in the 80s.  And I still see typewriter fonts used occasionally in marketing pieces, although obviously not as often as in the past. Mostly pieces aimed at older folks.

And designers also continue to simulate the look of Polaroid photos even though Polaroids are rarely used these days. Just an iconic look, I guess.</div>

Haven't you made a few of those yourself?

The process is commoditization, as the skilled products of one generation of technology users (e.g. scribes with pens) are automated and turned into a commodity (type) which imitates what went before. It's one of McLuhan's Laws.

In early Photoshop, it was possible to mimic "airbrush" effects, but difficult, as layers and dedicated filters did not exist. Then the effect was commoditized in pre-set filters.

But not everyone is beholden to using others' tools to make their thing, some make their own tools.

**

In typesetting, tasks which were done manually -- justification and kerning -- have now been automated.
Contentiously, InDesign's "Optical" kerning fakes the "Metrics" kerning in digital fonts, which in turn fakes the manual on-demand, instance-by-instance kerning of foundry type composing.

<em>Nick, you seem to know a lot about the subject? </em>

I wrote a series of magazine articles 2000-2005, some of which address the role of technological change in type and design culture, which IMO is the Big Question. They're at shinntype.com, under "Writing".</div>

 I do not think that any of my faces have any relevance to pre-occuring specific "hands." The fact that they are writ does not mean they are fakes.

Name me one Nick. And the fact that I have availed myself to modern technology does not mean I am "faking it" any more than any other production method; type "throughout the centuries" has regurgitated copies/revisions/whatever ad nauseam. At least I don't rely on forms that have been done to death... over and over again.</div>

I wasn't suggesting you were. I've argued above that with each generation of new technology, much of the fresh output mimics the effects of previous technology, and is in that sense fakery, adopting the appearance of something that it is not.

When people use a script font that is strongly informed by hand lettering skills, they want some of that cachet without paying for a custom job, and quicker and more immediately flexible. At the same time, script fonts have their own dialog with type and type history. It is a horse of a slightly different color, because the typographer can experiment with the setting typographically.
