  Louis Car Company Builder's Plates above.\r\n\r\nThe Builder's Plates in the photos
  came from PCC trolleys, which were built from 1936-1952.\r\n\r\nThanks for all of
  your help.\r\n\r\n-Dean"

  body: Given the rather clumsy construction, it's probably not based on an actual
    typeface. The letterforms are very early twentieth century; it seems to me that
    Hobo is probably about as close as you could get with an off-the-rack font.
