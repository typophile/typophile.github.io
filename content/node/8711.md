body: The last traditional type foundry in England&#40;?&#41; closed it&#39;s doors
  over the Christmas holidays. <BR> <BR>As discussed elsewhere on these pages they&#39;ve
  not been producing type for a number of years, instead making &#40;among other things&#41;
  brass electrode bars and dies for high frequency welding. <BR> <BR>Tom Blake told
  me that he had an offer he couldn&#39;t refuse for the site in the centre of Sheffield,
  so decided to sell up a couple of years sooner than planned. <BR> <BR>He also tells
  me that his wife <b>will</b> get used to the press in the garage! <BR> <BR>All things
  must pass.
