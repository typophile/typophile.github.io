body: Here's the title treatment for Wes Anderson's new film, "The Darjeeling Limited."
  Seems like a strange choice to me. Anyone recognize the font?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thedarjeelinglimited_5080.gif]

    . If it is, besides all the handtooling, the J is notably different.

    Highway</a>. It has the right J. It may have been widened a bit, but I think the
    underlying letters may have come from here, using some merge features to make
    the partially outlined font look.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    have either Jason Schwartzman or a Wilson brother in it...and then I looked at
    the cast list. '

    inline.\r\n\r\nThe W is quite distinctive, and very unlike the fonts named so
    far.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/darjeelingcredits_4849.jpg]"

    I can't remember the names of his other films, but I thought all had appearances
    of Futura?\r\n\r\nOf course, that provides no help for solving this puzzle."

  body: Completely by accident (via [[http://typeforyou.org|Type for You]]), I came
    across the designer of the movie's custom font, Boris Dworschak. [[http://www.borisdworschak.de|His
    website]] says that it comes in three weights, but doesn't provide much other
    info.
