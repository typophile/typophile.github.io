  I walked the French Quarter last weekend looking for cool signs, I became aware
  of the typographic world around me. I was looking for signs that had texture, color
  and antique quality about them. I was also struck by humorous, Bourbon St. signage
  and fun handmade signs. My favorite signs are One Eyed Jacks, Preservation Hall,
  and Mint Julip. They are all painted on wood and look old. What makes New Orleans
  signage unique from other parts of the country is that handmade antique quality.
  These signs are not mass produced by Signs Inc., or whatever. They are one of a
  kind works of art themselves; they have history; they are unique- just like New
  Orleans.\r\n\r\n"
