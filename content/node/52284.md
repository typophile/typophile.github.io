body: I'm looking for fonts that convey an aggresively masculine look, the sorts of
  fonts that really don't work for much outside of logos for sports teams and motorcycle
  dealerships. The only thing I can think of right now is Larabie's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/ethnocentric/ethnocentric/">Ethnocentric</a>,with
  terminals that look a bit like razor blades. Any ideas?
