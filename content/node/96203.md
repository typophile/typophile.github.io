    a character should have in contrast with it main stroke or stem?'

  body: "I wish it were that easy. Before one can answer the question of stroke contrast,
    some questions need to be answered about the intended appearance and use of the
    face. So, if you asked,  \"What should be the contrast of a boring bold san serif,
    for use around 24 point?\", one of us could help with an approximate ratio, range,
    or examples of them. \r\n\r\nYou can also just look at some fonts like yours and
    measure them.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."

    a couple of Good Rules, for any text face at any target point size:\r\n- The caps
    should be shorter than the ascenders (unless they're unusually narrow).\r\n- The

  body: "\r\nI know that the answer of this question is 'it dependes'. I ask because
    I think that proportion is what define a character, i.e if you fail to get a right
    proportion, your characters look terrible\u2026\r\n\r\nBut now I start this discussion;
    I want to pick a typeface and compare two sizes: let's say FF Quadraat Regular
    at 6pt and FF Quadraat Regular at 24pt; [img:sites/default/files/old-images/FFQuadraat_4310.png]\r\n\r\nI
    resize them to fit in the same x and cap height.\r\nI think the diference do not
    exist in this example\u2026\r\n\r\nBut, let's discuss it\r\n---------\r\nThanks\r\nF\xE1bio

    four times larger and then reducing it to a quarter its size, and expecting it

    about a percentage of black to white that seemed correct to the eye, something
    like 60% black to 40% white?  (Those figures are probably off)"
