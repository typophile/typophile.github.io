  and beginner in type design, I'd really appreciate any input you might have on this
  face, not only regarding technical inconsistencies between individual letters, but
  also your overall impressions, etc. If any of you were at the TypeCon 2006 TypeCrit,
  you may rememeber this as the \"<a href=\"http://typophile.com/froggy\">other</a>\"
  semi-serif that was present. It has no name as of yet. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/djr_alphabet_6569.gif]"

  body: "Hi David,\r\n\r\nLooks great! It definitely is very energetic. \r\n\r\nOne
    thing that jumps a bit at me is the terminal of the lower ear of the g. This brush
    stroke terminal only occurs at the g and feels a bit off-tune. What about giving
    it a cornered serif just like the j?\r\n\r\nWhile having only serifs on the right
    stem of all multistem letters (e.g. m, n, x, h, k) gives it that creative off-the-beaten-track-energy
    (I think 'Froggy' from Dezcom also has this scheme), it impedes a bit the readability
    I think. But depending on the application this could be perfectly o.k. \r\n\r\nDid
    you consider having two-sided serifs on single stem letters like l, r, f? Their
    current a-symmetric right pointing serifs look a bit confusion if you just see
    the individual letter, but when reading words, it's o.k. What sbout a serif having
    a small left pointing part? Why doesn't the i have a serif?\r\n\r\nBtw, your specimen
    looks great!\r\n\r\nTake my input with a grain of salt, I am a beginner myself...\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n"

  body: "The beaks immediately remind me of Swift's <em>a</em> and <em>f</em>, and
    to tell you the truth, I was kind of looking for a semi serif that reads like
    butter myself. Hopefully I get to print the specimen out tomorrow and give a more
    in depth critique.\r\n\r\nI think you should make a teapot glyph for this face,
    too :)"

  body: "Looks great! Definitely has a personality.\r\n\r\nSome observations:\r\n*
    The L is optically too narrow.\r\n* The R feels a little \"tense\". Relax the
    curve a little bit. This is currently the biggest problem I see with the typeface.
    Same thing, in much smaller degree, with the Q.\r\n* g feels slightly awkward.
    I'm referring to the lower ear. Makes the g sort of stick out.\r\n* When faced
    with a choice, always go for more restrained and readable. I think you do that,
    most of the time.\r\n\r\nReally looking forward to seeing this one finished!"

  body: "Thank you very much for the comments so far! I plan to come back and respond
    to your critiques in more depth, but I'm running late for class so I must be brief.
    I did want to let you know, since two of you have mentioned the lower ear of the
    g, that I spent a little time on an alternate g that with a closed counter. The
    open counter was in the original drawings, and I guess I never had the guts to
    switch it out. Do you prefer that?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/djr_g_4007.gif]\r\n\r\nSomething
    about it to me still doesn't feel right, but maybe I just haven't spent enough
    time with it.\r\n\r\nAnd bampitoyo, a teapot glyph is in the works :)\r\n\r\nMore
    later...\r\nDavid"

  body: "Hi David,\r\n\r\nThe new g looks better, but is in my opinion has a brush
    stroke feel which seems a bit estranged from the rest of the letters. What about
    the g below? I used the same serif style as you used for the j.\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g_5120.jpg]"

  body: "Termopolium: Thank you for commenting on the \"tense\" curves. The curves
    and the verticality of the face make it a bit rigid and static, and maybe letting
    them loose will improve it. I'll try to work on this and get a new specimen up,
    but it might not be immediately. \r\n\r\nBram: I am indeed trying to make something
    that is very readable in text, and hadn't looked at Swift before you mentioned
    it. I'm eager to hear how you think it reads.\r\n\r\nSebastian: Thanks for showing
    me what you mean about the g. I think I understand your point, but I want to make
    sure. I know that you're talking about the brushy end of the stroke, and adding
    a terminal there is an interesting approach. I was concerned about the gap being
    too quirky before, and this makes it quirkier. Will it still work in text? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/djr_g2_6702.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nNormally
    the terminal comes out of a thin stroke, not a thick, and I'm worried that all
    that weight next to that gap might be too distracting in text. It's worth playing
    around. However, I see now that you were also talking about the contrast of the
    loop, and I really like what you've done here; it matches the other letters much
    better. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDavid"

  body: "Sebastian: Oooh...I like that first one especially. Yeah it doesn't have
    the terminal, but I was looking for ways to bring more of a sans serif feel out
    (so that it doesn't start to look like a serif that's just missing serifs), and
    that might be a good start. But, you're right, that if I wanted to put a terminal
    there, I'd have to round it out a bit.\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention: the i should
    definitely have a bottom serif, I don't know what I was thinking.\r\n\r\nI'm going
    to be working on getting a new specimen up with some of the suggestions that you
    all have made, focusing mostly on curve tension, my handling of serifs, and that
    pesky g.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "So I've finally gotten around to incorporating your suggestions on this semi-serif
    face (still unnamed). A pdf is up top in the original post. It's been a while
    I know; I've been letting this font simmer while focusing on other projects. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/djr_alphabet2_4019.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    tried to fix the curves up a bit, but things still seemed a little tense. In the
    old version, the stems were vertical, and to me the serifs made them optically
    lean back a touch, adding to its stiffness. In this version, I've tried compensating
    for that by giving it a little tilt. Let me know if you think it works.\r\n\r\nI
    couldn't get bilateral serifs on the single-stemmed letters to work; it impeded
    the rhythm too much. I did work a lot with the lc g, using Sebastian's examples
    as a guide (thank you again Sebastian for your work on those).\r\n\r\nI'm excited
    to see what people think of the changes, and of course to get any general comments
    on the design. I'm also curious to hear if people would ever use this font if
    it were fully developed, and if so, what size and treatment you think it is best
    suited for.\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated,\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "From a quick glance:\r\n\r\nHow about moving the bottom serif of <em>f</em>
    to face left, and eliminate the one on <em>r</em>? I know it's not exactly consistent,
    but I'd like to avoid both letters from falling over.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I like
    the overall refinement of the design. I do have to agree that it still felt kind
    of stiff, though.\r\n\r\nMore explanations are due tomorrow. I'm way too tired
    right now :)"

  body: "Thanks, Bram. The r and the f have always felt unbalanced, and I was futzing
    a lot with them to try to make them work. I don't know about you, but they don't
    bother me too much in the text, but at larger sizes they definitely sticks out.
    Here's what I did real quickly:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newrf_4386.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    think the r still looks out of place, but I don't mind the inconsistency in the
    f as much as I thought I would. I also tried a descending f out for fun. Is this
    kind of what you were thinking of? \r\n\r\nAs far as the tense issue goes, do
    you have any suggestions on how I could get rid of it? I'm thinking the best way
    would be to just redraw the letters.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "To tell you the truth, I never actually printed your specimen, so my analysis
    wasn't exactly done in full justice.\r\n\r\nThat two-storey <em>f</em> was a nice
    idea. I would reduce the space between the f's by a touch, though.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the stiffness, my theory is that the strong vertical stroke, when coupled with
    the Swift-like slabs on <em>a, c, e, f,</em> etc. (this is not your bottom slabs
    which I like), might have something to do with it. My suggestion is to move your
    pen angle to the side and tone the slabs down a little bit.\r\n\r\nBeyond that,
    ask Typophile's many experts :)\r\n\r\nAnyways, below is two hastily done pen-tool
    tracing of your <em>f</em> to illustrate my points. It's too wide, so I'm afraid
    you have to scroll right too see it in full-size.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/suggestion_nobezier_4534.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/suggestion_bezier_6441.png]"

  body: "I like the terminal you've made for me quite a bit, Bram. Cutting it at an
    angle makes the form less rigid and mechanical, and that slabby-wedge shape is
    more graceful than the thick square that I was using. \r\n\r\nAs far as tilting
    the pen angle goes, I think it's worth a shot. It may take a little time to implement,
    though, so don't hold your breath. Some diagonal cuts and subtle curves would
    help this design chill out a little. I don't want to lose too much of that stark
    verticality, though; I may be wrong, but I think that's what gives it some personality.\r\n\r\nThis
    is exactly the kind of stuff I'm looking for, and I am very grateful for your
    help.\r\n\r\nDavid"
