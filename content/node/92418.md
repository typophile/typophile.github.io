body: Any idea what this font might be, or even what might be close to it? My client
  would like to use it as a logo, and I'd like to use the font elsewhere in his designs.

  body: "The fact that it\u2019s show only on a plaque led me to believe it\u2019s
    not a \u201Cfont\u201D as we mean the term.\r\nThe G would prove especially difficult
    to match.\r\nIn a similar vein, you could look at something like Biondi (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/biondi/)
    or something from Letterhead Fonts (http://www.letterheadfonts.com/) more on the
    \u201Coctagonal\u201D side there\u2019s this (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-antique-half-bock/),
    for example."
