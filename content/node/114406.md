    is heartbreaking...\r\nMy sympathies go out to his partner and his children (I
    think they have more than one)."

  body: "What a tragedy. Peter was a long-standing member of our community, both at
    Typophile and type design at large. He'll be terribly missed. Our hearts go out
    to his wife and kids at this sad, sad time.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Peter was not a self-promoter, so his influence reaches further than most
    know. Much of his work was in making other people\u2019s work better. He was also
    a close friend. <a href=\"http://typographica.org/on-typography/peter-bruhn-1969-2014/\">I
    posted a tribute at Typographica.</a>"
