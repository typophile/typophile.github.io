  weights, but when i activate them, Indesign separate them, What i get is, a bunch
  of the same fonts with different weights. What i want is, in my character panel
  just 1 font and when i choise it, in the second scroll bar, all the weights.\r\n\r\nDoes
  someone knows the most easiest way to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nMr. Brown"
