  than desktop fonts (just as desktop fonts are different creatures from woodcut fonts).
  The Web is a different medium than print - as such some fonts work better with the
  medium than others.\r\n\r\nI wrote up a first pass at the broad characteristics
  of a font that make it work well on the Web, what I'm calling: 'web native' -\r\n[[http://garrickvanburen.com/archive/web-fonts-identifying-a-new-species|Web
  Fonts \u2013 Identifying a New Species]]. \r\n\r\nI've boiled it down to openness
  and speed-of-communication in both letterforms (large x-heights, open counters,
  etc) and licensing (OFL, MIT, etc).\r\n \r\nWhat have I missed?"

  body: "If you are only interested in @font-face-based options, you might specify
    that at the top of your page. Other models are going to be equally prevalent for
    various licensing and display purposes. @font-face is a part of the picture, so
    it seems inaccurate to describe this subset of web font technologies as \"Web
    Fonts\" or even \"web-native\" fonts. Many commercial and proprietary fonts will
    be engineered for native web use as well. \r\n\r\nOur previous model for web-readiness
    of fonts was the system fonts that come with PCs. Those, rather than the primitive
    early designs from Emigre, set a benchmark, and satisfy the most important criteria
    for robust web display.\r\n\r\nOpenness and speed in the context of fonts should
    also refer to fonts' technical abilities to download and display quickly and well
    on any device. Fonts won't perform, and therefore can't be considered web-native,
    if they aren't also built intentionally for the low-res media of web/mobile devices.
    So consider adding a third trait: web-native engineering. Unhinted TTFs, however
    free, open, or distributable, aren't likely to gain wide acceptance on the web
    if they look like hell. There have already been missteps in this area. A permissive
    license doesn't preclude a font from failing in this new medium.\r\n\r\nI wonder
    if you can tighten up some of your language. \"the thin and thick parts of the
    letterforms ... should be close.\" This implies they are close in proximity. You
    might say about letterforms that web fonts should be low-contrast or that their
    hairlines should be thicker than those of ordinary print fonts. I would also suggest
    calling the enhanced visual quality \"readability\" rather than \"scannability\",
    since the reality is that web fonts are going to be part of increased screen reading.\r\n\r\nConsider
    other possible licensing models for web-native fonts. Plenty of marketing occurs,
    and will increasingly occur online, that depends on specific, exclusive fonts
    as part of brands and campaigns. The Guardian, New York Times, GE, and other entities
    want to communicate broadly and well, without freely sharing design assets that
    can be re-used by others. Facility in delivering web pages or other digital content
    in design-specific fonts isn't necessarily linked to free distribution, reproduction
    or remixing.\r\n\r\nI might be misinterpreting some of what you have said, but
    I think you could be more specific about just what sorts of fonts you are discussing. "

  body: "You should make a clear distinction between typefaces and fonts.\r\nAnd address
    the issue of the relationship between web fonts and screen fonts.\r\n\r\nA typeface
    is a general, fairly abstract design that may exist in different physical manifestations
    (fonts), for use in different output situations.\r\n\r\nThus, a typeface may be
    nuanced as more than one font, for use at different sizes in the same document
    (\"text\" and \"display\"), or for different media (e.g. smooth or glossy paper)
    in the same printing process. See H&JF's \"grading\".\r\n\r\nGaramond, for instance,
    has been adapted from letterpress fonts, to phototype (ITC Garamond), to low-res
    LaserWriter output (Adobe Garamond). Which of those will the best web Garamond
    font be like?\r\n\r\nTypefaces may be adapted for radically different media: hinting
    is one thing that accomplishes this in the digital realm.\r\n\r\nOne thing about
    typeface design is that the old styles have persisted across media changes, why
    should that change with the Web?\r\n\r\nLarge x-heights and open counters are
    not a necessary characterisitic of screen typefaces. \r\nWhy would a good screen
    typeface not vary x-height and counter size with pixel resolution, exactly in
    the manner of an optically-scaled print typeface?!\r\n\r\nLook at how clumsy Verdana
    and Georgia become on screen at larger sizes.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, there <em>are</em>
    type design issues which are screen-specific. But that's getting into the relationship
    between sub-pixel hinting and curve shape. You can see this happening in the ClearType
    faces.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "With all due respect I reject the biological analogy because there is a common
    biological entity at the end of both print and web processes. The different expectations
    of text and display, by that common biological entity, are congruent across media.
    E.G. (as Nick says sorta), differences you site like openness, are in a spectrum,
    i.e. the font desired by the person at 9 point for print, is \"the same as\" what
    the person wants for 13 point on the screen. \r\n\r\nThe biological entity is
    \"only human\" though so you can't trust it. E.G. there is a thread here where
    a type designer outputs a font in 7 different renderings and then picks the lightest
    and blackest as his 1st and 2nd choices, leaving others to wonder what the heck
    he's thinking about criteria-wise. ;)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@garrick\r\n\r\nHaving had a few days to ponder:\r\n\r\n1) Not crazy about
    comingling the criteria of licenses PLUS the onscreen look of a font to pronounce
    it \"Web Native\".\r\nLicenses are categorizable, so are fonts based on certain
    visual features. I think you *should* point out these distinctions on Kernest
    but independently of each other.\r\n\r\n2) Personally, I don't like the phrase
    \"Web Native\". Too ethereal for my taste. If you have to explain it - as you
    have done - then I would argue it doesn't mean anything because you have to explain
    it. But that's me.\r\n\r\nPlus, as you and I have discussed elsewhere, what happens
    when print stylesheets (and other @media categories) start getting used for serious
    publishing purposes (like Prince's HTML to PDF conversion stuff does now)?\r\nAre
    the fonts we'll be looking to use in that context any less \"web native\" or are
    we going to label them as something else?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me you're allowing
    the limitations of LCD displays to define that which is \"web\" and that which
    is not, now and forevermore.\r\n\r\nrich"

  body: "John>What thread is that, David?\r\nlol. . . I'm sorry, were you trying to
    make a font family from a single master? \r\n\r\nIf you were looking for graphic
    images of text for design work, as you show, you perfectly well can feed a single
    master into the web's 'font software' and get a family of weights, (and a grunge
    style of two), somewhere in the output. My pardons if that was the intent. \r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    I'd support convincing someone to make something \u2014 a browser, OS subsystem,
    or page descriptor, that could... uncontrollably auto-oblique all the web type
    for some users. Then the web could 'give us' a full family of weights with italic
    and grunge from a single style.\r\n\r\nBut seriously, with formatting, font identification,
    selection of style, sizing, scaling, and rendering relatively consistent in print,
    I think we're seeing the effects of making all this 'different', and each different
    in its own unique way, on the web.\r\n\r\nGranted, the web and print are \"two
    completely different things\", but the 2d web needs to be a lot like 2d print,
    so often. I don't think 2d web design can be 10x the complexity of 2d print design
    as a result of this kind of 'different'. \r\n\r\nNor do I think quality web typography
    can be 10x the complexity of quality print typography. \r\n\r\nPlace Chinese proverb
    here.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
