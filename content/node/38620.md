  I believe they are refered to as BackLigatures, is this the right term??\r\nAny
  suggestions for this particular font, or any other fonts with similar ligatures.\r\nThanxx\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AcornHouse02_4644.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AcornHouse_4466.jpg]"

  body: "Also in a lot of Adobe OpenType Pro fonts, like Caslon (st, ct), Garamond
    (ct), Garamond Premier, Jenson, Minion, Warnock (latter all with ct, st, sp).\r\nGalliard
    Pro has ct and st, its Italic additionally sp; same goes for Hoefler Text.\r\nIt
    seems just <em>every</em> new pro text font includes them \u2026 Of course, you
    could find even more in the realm of script fonts, or playful italics like Sauna
    (ch, ck, cl, ct, sh, sk, sl, st).\r\n \r\nBut \u2013 guess what \u2013 the winner
    for ligatures with a top arc (at least in my humble collection) is a <em>sans</em>:
    Meta Pro comes with cb, ch, ck, cl, ct, sb, sch, sh, sk, sl, sp and st!"
