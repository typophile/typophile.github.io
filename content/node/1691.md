body: '&#62;&#62; having a full-fledged off-topic forum on Typophile is not a good
  idea.  <BR>-- hhp, from the Definition of Terrorism thread. <BR> <BR>I think it
  remains to be seen whether the non-typographic <BR>thread is useful or not, whether
  it&#39;ll turn out good, bad or <BR>ugly. Formalized venting is one way to describe
  it, but not <BR>the only way. <BR> <BR>It hasn&#39;t really been tested. <BR> <BR>Of
  course it seems like a useful place to share an off-topic <BR>link, a news item,
  lawyer jokes, Bengal Tiger sightings, etc. <BR>This stuff is getting tossed into
  General Discussions. <BR>This is just a more specific place to toss it. <BR> <BR>Focus,
  that&#39;s your mantra Hrant, if i&#39;m not mistaken. <BR> <BR>Does organizing
  a library by subject compartmentalize discourse?... <BR> <BR>Why not just have one
  big general thread <BR>and call it Stuff about Letters; that&#39;ll contribute to
  <BR>making us all rounded people I suppose. <BR> <BR>The thread also serves as a
  spillover area when things veer <BR>off topic and turn ugly. Who wants Hrant v.
  William <BR>name-calling in their InBox? I know I know, we haven&#39;t <BR>seen
  ugly. <BR> <BR>To say that the existence and usage of a little thread in an  <BR>online
  forum makes us less-rounded people?... autobrainwashing?...c&#39;mon. <BR> <BR>bj'

  body: I think this non-typographic bin will prove useful as a place to redirect
    discussions from other threads that go off-topic. This happens, and it is better
    for the off-topic discussion to be moved here than for the original thread to
    die because it gets taken over by off-topic posts.

  body: If the non typographic general discussion forum is kept, it should be a full
    forum and not a sub forum, just for ease of use.
