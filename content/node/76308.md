body: 'hi im completely new to fontlab, i have just started using it in a university
  project. My problem is when I go into the metrics window and start typing, certain
  letters will ''merge'', like if I type an E and then follow with an F and try to
  adjust kerning, the F just sits on top of the E instead of coming after it. It does
  this with a few seemingly random letter combinations, can someone tell me what I
  am doing wrong? thanks '
