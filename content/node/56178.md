body: "I have a very basic typeface built in FontLab Studio that I've been having
  trouble with. (Based on a simple grid, composed of simple four node dots)\r\n\r\nI've
  exported and tested plenty of OpenType fonts with much success, yet this particular
  font/file seems corrupted.\r\n\r\nI've tried everything, from cutting and pasting
  into a new .vfb file.\r\n\r\nGoing over all the OpenType features, classes, kerning,
  metrics, font audit, ligatures, etc\u2026\r\n\r\nI've deleted all the kerning info,
  class info, and OpenType features just to see if the problem would be on that end
  of things and generated it still without success.\r\n\r\nI've gone through the font
  naming, dimensions, encoding and unicode, and etc\u2026\r\n\r\nThe Output panel
  reports NO errors.\r\n\r\nI've even sent it through the Fontlab tech support only
  to have the suggestions not render it a success.\r\n\r\nIt is a 2000 UPM font, but
  I've generated plenty that have worked exceptionally, I even changed it to 1000
  just to try it at that UPM with no success.\r\n\r\nTHE ONLY THING THAT HAS WORKED
  which has allowed me to generate a working .otf font file is to delete about a third
  of the glyphs in my .vfb file which incidentally deletes the alternate characters
  and extended ligatures as well as numerous other standard characters.\r\n\r\nAt
  this point I'm completely baffled.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing in FontLab Studio that
  I can see or do that indicates a problem so I'm at a point that logically I don't
  know what else to do our how to continue troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nThe message reported
  when importing into FontExplorer X and Fontbook is as follows.\r\n\r\n\"A problem
  has been detected with the font Output S Regular, in the font file /Documents/Reserves/09-Output/Output
  S-Regular.otf. The system will attempt to disable this font, but to avoid future
  problems, you should quit all of your open applications and remove this font file
  or replace it with a new version.\"\r\n\r\nI would love to have someone like Adam
  T. take a look at the files even if it's just to get closer to what this problem
  could be as not having an answer is really bothering me.\r\n \r\nI'm almost at the
  point of just abandoning this particular font altogether and moving along but I'm
  really curious what this could be\u2026 trouble shooting is usually a simple, and
  pretty painless process but this has been out of control.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any
  suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike"

    isn't the first time I've deleted glyphs troubleshooting and had it work but if
    I recall I had to delete at least two rows which I could guesstimate would be
    about 60 glyphs, I'd really have to do one row at a time and then single it down
    to each glyph to find where it starts working)\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head I
    imagine some past fonts have had up to that number of glyphs, which isn't many,
    comparatively speaking\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike"

    the seemingly corrupted version, actually 290 glyphs) with all and it installed
    fine, activated and all\u2026 problem is, I've strictly been creating PS OT fonts
    and have been kind of set on one format, whatever it is I've learned about each,
    I recall PS is favored over TT?"

    half the glyphs then went through each one by one and noticed that within 'registered'
    and 'copyright', two components had overlapped, and when decomposed and 'merged'
    the outlines became garbled and I had overlooked it\u2026 I assumed that was the
    problem, and now I have only one character that Font Audit is flagging and that
    is the apple symbol which is my 'R' logo, which is in every other font I've designed\u2026
    \r\n\r\nSo even still I might try just deleting that one character\u2026 I keep
    thinking that since it's at 2000 UPM could it cause an error if, with accented
    characters the ascender height becomes too high?\r\n\r\nOr can an error occur
    if a character is too wide such as an FFL ligature?\r\n\r\nI have to get to the
    bottom of this and move on\u2026\r\n\r\nFor such a simple, grid based type, built
    out of 4 node circles this sure is strange."

  body: "Mike, \r\n\r\nif you leave it unchecked at all times, all your fonts will
    be slightly larger, and they will generate faster, but there will be no other
    impact on the functionality. In general, it is allright to leave the compression
    enabled. But in case of highly modularized fonts which are made of repetitive
    elements, you'll need to turn the compression off -- because of the bug. \r\n\r\nThe
    next version, FontLab Studio 6 (no release date yet) will use the new Adobe FDK
    for OpenType 2.5 which no longer has this problem so people will be able to leave
    compression enabled at all times. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"
