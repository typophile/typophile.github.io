  body: It's along the lines of something like <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/rotis-semi-serif/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26seed%3D30%26dock%3D0%26size%3D81%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DRBC%2520Center%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga">Rotis
    Semi Sans</a> but would have to agree that its custom.
