  on a highjacked arabic range, I do not manage to create one which Word XP would
  accept : either it crashes or Word will switch to another font each times I try
  to use my font. <BR>So my question is : is there somewhere a list of compulsory
  specifications for an arabic font to be usable by uniscript ? <BR>For instance my
  sogdian font has far less glyphs than an arabic one, so that I have deleted some
  of the arabic letters. But may be Uniscript will not accept to recognize a font
  as arabic without the complete set of basic arabic letters ? This is this kind of
  information that I need. What are the minimum requirements for a font to be used
  by uniscript ? a link or any help would be welcome. <BR> <BR> <BR>Etienne'

    but the RichEdit rich text format layout engine which is used by Word and other
    MS apps for, among other things, &#39;intelligent&#39; font switching. This often
    annoys me, partly because I&#39;ve never figured out exactly what algorithm RichEdit
    uses to determine whether a given font supports a specific script or languages.
    It may well be that all Arabic characters from the MS Arabic codepage need to
    be present in a font in order for that font to be recognised as Arabic.
