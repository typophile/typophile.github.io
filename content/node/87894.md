    70s. Look into linguistics if you want hear the jargon.  The old classic designers
    book would be Diethelm's \"Signal, Signet, Symbol\".\r\n\r\nor else, you could
    wait another dozen years for me to finally finish my dissertation ;-)"

  body: "Don't make it too complicated. We humans are born in a way that we see signs
    everywhere and in many things. We are experts in interpreting them. Everything
    we see we interpret with the informations we already have. \r\n\r\nSo a sensible
    approach to study the semiotic aspect of a subject is to understand what other
    people, or even the creator, say about the studied subject, not as facts or knowledge,
    but as interpretation or \u201Creading\u201D. Yes, depending on the \u201C aesthetic
    database\u201D and the level of awareness people will say different things, but
    that can be put into the respective context of the person making a statement.
    People will always do interpretative work anyhow on things we understand as signs,
    because they try to figure out the meaning. \r\n\r\nBtw, I send you a message
    through the forum software to your mail account you are registered here with.

    and design papers 1-6. Stuff from those is pretty transferable because it''s all
    about visual language, and the semiotics in type is visual language for the mass
    audience. '
