body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI working on a project which requires me to recreate the 'with
  compliments' text and address seen in the top sample. The font used here is Akzidenz
  Grotesk Extended. I don't currently have this font and the company were not willing
  to pay the just under \xA3350 for the two weights required for this small job so
  I am trying to create something similar using fonts I already have. \r\n\r\nAs seen
  in the image below, the second sample from the top is using Helvetica Neue, which
  I have manually extended to make it look similar. There are a few subtle differences
  though, such as the numbers and the letter R. \r\n\r\nI then tried using ITC Blair,
  as seen in the third sample. This is all with the medium weight, however I may purchase
  the light weight if I decide to go ahead with this option. This is also different,
  but in some ways is more similar than the Helvetica Neue sample.\r\n\r\nWhich do
  you think looks most similar to the original image, and do you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help!    "

    you don't already own that might be close enough to AG.\r\n\r\n2) Don't stretch
    fonts by more than tiny fractions, especially monoline ones.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Thanks for your response. I know what you mean, I looked at others such
      as Trade Gothic and Helvetica Extended but these didn't seem any more similar
      than the ones I was already using. Do you have any ideas of any similar fonts?\r\n\r\nAlso,
      thanks for the advice about stretching fonts, I'll bear that in mind in future.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "At ATypI Amsterdam, Sofie Beier presented her Neutral typeface design. She
    designed it for legibility research projects that investigated the effect of styles
    such as light \u2014 bold, regular \u2014 italic and condensed \u2014 extended
    on legibility. For Sofie Beier, Neutral is something in between Neo-Grotesque
    / Modern Sans (Univers, Helvetica, Unica, Folio and Akzidenz Grotesk except for
    the \u2018e\u2019 ;\u2013) and Humanist Sans (Gill, Frutiger, Syntax, Verdana).
    This resulted in a typeface that looks like Trade Gothic, News Gothic, Franklin
    Gothic, Arial, Venus, Scheltersche Grotesk etc. Quite something else than what
    Modernists like to think of as something neutral. My point is that I think that,
    when it comes to legibility, Sofie Beier has a better clue of that what is neutral
    than the advocators of the Modern Sans. On the other hand: \u201CMediocrity is
    always the correct weight, except its scales are not true\u201D, <em>Anselm Feuerbach</em>,
