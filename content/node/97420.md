body: I am looking to match, as closely as I can, this engraved font.  It was probably
  done by hand originally.  This appears on a 1905 pipe organ console.  Caslon and
  Vijaya seem kind of close but not close enough for our client.  Suggestions? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/KS2_5084.jpg]

  body: Sorry, don't know this typeface nor the font this lettering could have been
    based on. It reminds of those german typefaces used for [[http://typophile.com/node/71008|map
    and cartography]] like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kursivschrift/|Kursivschrift
    Liegend]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/roemisch/|Roemisch Liegend]].
    There's also, more rough, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/heck-italic/|Heck
    Italic]].
