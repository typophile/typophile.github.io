  \"E\" and the \"O\" appear to hold the key. If you need a larger sample (more letters)
  please let me know and I'll send it to you directly. As mentioned above, the closest
  font I can find is Rod McDonald's SLATE, but the \"E\" isn't quite right. \r\n\r\nAs
  always, your help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi, Alex.\r\nThanks for that. Calluna Sans Bold is very, very close as well.
    In fact, it's a better match than SLATE. Calluna looks like the font in my sample
    except it's ever so slightly condensed. Do you know if Calluna Sans is standard
    on most PCs? (I'm on a Mac.) I'm going to hunt around for a Calluna Sans Bold
    Expanded and see if it's a match. (If anything else comes to mind, please let
    me know.)\r\nBest,\r\nMark\r\n\r\n "

  body: No, it's not standard on PCs, but can be purchased, e.g. from MyFonts.
