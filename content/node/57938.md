body: "New to Typophile (thanks to Tiffany [here] and John [at ILT]) - former lurker,
  old to Fontographer, new to Fontlab (stuck on 4.6 for the time being), old to type
  design, new to Multiple Master design, old at breaking things and creating strange
  problems for myself...\r\n\r\nWell, I've been plugging away at my design for a few
  months now and have nice, full set of glyphs I'm pleased with - diacritics, alternates,
  ligatures, and so forth. I (naively) started replacing charatcers in an existing
  font whose character set I liked, made my own kerning classes (rights and lefts),
  defined a few other classes, set kerning nicely for my base set of U & lc and Small
  Caps, got my alternates and old style refined - and I've somehow broken it so completely
  I have no idea what I did.\r\n\r\nCompiling in the OT panel (or at output) results
  in a delightfully vague response:\r\n\r\n\"aborting because of errors\"\r\n\r\nHurray...\r\n\r\nFor
  a while it would complain certain kerning classes were missing when they're in my
  list, so I made it worse and now I'm just bewildered. The Fontlab manual seems to
  think I already know what I'm doing, so I've run out of self-generated options.\r\n\r\nHelp?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    you upgrade to Flab 5.\r\nI don't recall exactly what changed, but kerning was
    one area where I noticed huge improvement."

  body: "Jackson seems to have the best advice on this (and to Paragraph - I had two
    duplicate glyphs, thanks for that too). I've placed all characters in to a new,
    blank document and rebuilt/imported features and kerning from there and things
    are working correctly so far. Needed a good clean start apparently. \r\n\r\nA
    note to another vague error (see: http://typophile.com/node/33743?destination=node%2F33743)
    I got a balk on output with no OT compile errors, turns out the file needed font
    name and info or it'd choke at 91% output every time.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael"
