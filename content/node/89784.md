  with the font I'm looking to figure out.\r\n\r\nhttp://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f219/Jinjo402/SSXFont.jpg\r\nhttp://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f219/Jinjo402/Untitled-5.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  assume the \"Online Features, Part 1, Part 2\" are the best representations cause
  they aren't skewed in perspective.\r\n\r\nI also believe the \"Uber Mondays\" in
  the second image link is the same font in lowercase. (that font is from this video:
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JyNWlGbsoo )\r\n\r\nI'm gonna fool around with other
  font identifying sites in the meantime, but I thought I'd post this here to help
  out.\r\n\r\nHopefully my images help out.  Going down one by one in Photoshop's
  default list didn't. :P"

  body: I think you nailed it, man.  Just used "Helvetica Neue LT Com" at "95 Black"
    at 86 pt for "ONLINE FEATURES" and it perfectly overlaps the first pic.
