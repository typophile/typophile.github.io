  body: I thought it might be from [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/foundry%3A%28greater+albion%29/fonts/|Greater
    Albion]] but it isn't. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/inglenook-corner-nf/|Inglenook
    Corner NF]] is based on a similar style. It might be something from [[www.letterheadfonts.com|Letterhead
    Fonts]].
