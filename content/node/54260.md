body: I like how Paul Rand combined to interesting but opposite images together to
  form a thought out composition. The image on the bottom gives the piece direction
  and movement while the image at the top is more solid making the image stable. The
  text on the left is interesting because it is cut off at the top and seems to be
  a mixture of numbers and letters. I also love the combination of a cool and warm
  colors.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/paulrand_6108.jpg]
