  will be used for titles and the only thing that will be in the font is state names,
  California, Vermont, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are so many types of beer out there from
  all over the world, but i need something that is domestic and makes me think, beer,
  good beer.\r\n\r\nany ideas?"

    \r\nThen, what about Giza \u2013 http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/giza/
    or another quirky, dark slab-serif? For the \"strenght\" i would prefer an extended,
    dark weight here.\r\n\r\nOr a \"woodtype\" Sans like Maple, bold or black weight.

  body: "it's tough to encapsulate such a diverse subject.  I like your keywords but
    I am not sure if the western style fonts is the type of 'tradition' I am going
    for.  when i think craft beer, I think Samual Adams, which is one of the biggest
    'craft' breweries (sold on the NYSE even).\r\n\r\nThey use a stately serif type.
    \ But it shouldn't be too grandiose since craft beer is about variety, taste and
    comfort.\r\n\r\ni like your suggestions, but could use some more."

    strong beer, isn't it? The Lords of that kind of beer in continental europe are
    from Belgium. Check this, really wonderful designs outta there and of course \u2013
    taste!\r\n\r\nAhem, cheers"

    right out of a tap on the side of my computer. Into a nice tall glass. In the
    middle of the day. That is the typographic breakthrough I am waiting for.\r\n\r\nI
    hear the martini glasses calling. I must leave now.\r\n\r\npowers"

    could even use different members of the set depending on\r\nhow tipsy your typesetting
    needs to look! Cheshire is merely\r\nbuzzed, while Warwickshire involves driving
    home relying on\r\nwhat I call The Law Of Averages. And being Tankard fonts\r\nthey're
    all... well crafted!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
