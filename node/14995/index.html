  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I recently presented a client with some initial concepts which were quite well received.  However, we quickly got into the disucssion about 'appropriateness' regarding a particular typeface.  It's an ultra-simple grid-based font.

We agreed that it would probably be more appropriate if the edges of the elements were not sharp...instead they should all be rounded.

And so, I'm in a position to build a font that is clearly based upon something else, yet I'm making some small global changes.  I don't even own the face in question so there is no basis for me to copy their actual work...but I  wonder if there is some etiquette regarding these kinds of things?

Any tips?

Thanks...</div>

The client licenses the original foundries type properly, i.e. for the number of machines and locations as specified by the eula. 2. you customize it as the client wishes. 3. the client replaces the customized font into the same licensing "footprint" as the original font. 4. You don't license the font to anyone else unless they have the same deal as the first client, and it's not exclusive to that client, or you totally recreate the font from scratch, remaking all the contours, all spacing and tables as if it was new.

 This course of action is only acceptable<em> if </em>the license from the original foundry allows modifications.

Many foundries, including The Font Bureau. don't allow modifications. This has been discussed at length in this forum.

		<div class="commentbody">You say “small changes”, what does that mean? To me, the first thing is to look at the EULA.  If you don’t own the font, ask the foundry about it. If you are just doing a few words and not an actual font and the result will not be taken as the original you are probably OK. If you are making an entire font for sale competing with the original, it should be clearly enough different to not be taken as a rip off.  If it must look just like the original with a few minor changes, ask the designer to do it for you or give you permission to do it your self.

Who are "people"? The designer-user? The reader? Other type designers?

		<div class="commentbody">Poor writing skills kill the thread...I totally bunged this one up.  I was trying to get at something other than legal issues:

<cite>I don’t even own the face in question so there is no basis for me to copy their actual work…but I wonder if there is some etiquette regarding these kinds of things?</cite>

I was trying to talk about the etiquette of showing others where the inspiration came from.  The designer in question talks about where his inspiration originated (other fonts).  Perhaps it's a completely stupid question...

So, is there some etiquette that typographers (I'm a designer of 10 years but not a traditional typographer) use in these instances?  Are there some generic rules?

The new font that I will likely be creating is unique enough...will not be for sale (unless somebody wants to handle that for me - too busy)...and is only based up the inspiration of another face.

Perhaps Arial should have referred to Helvetica or Grotesque, but it didn't.  Some fonts do try to show the influence.  I'm in new waters here...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I personally don't think you should share your source for inspiration.

1. The client could end up liking the source and wanting you to round the corners of the source and you'll be left with a typeface you've created and hope someone else wants it.
2. Giving clients too much information can sometimes muddy the waters of simplicity.

So, you don't have the typeface, but you did use it? How did you use it? Or I mean how were you able to draw inspiration from it?

Inspiration carries the torch from hand to hand, but copying steals the light. Be glad of what truly inspires you. Trying to introduce a client to your Muse is a wasted effort IMHO.</div>

See, it's only fluff if you don't attach quantifiable (objective) meaning to it -- and I'm not talking about faking your way through it like kids in a 100-level college art class. I've found that some clients like to understand why something "feels" the way it does. </div>

if you use a grid you've seen used by somebody else, but you have to rebuild it entirely from scratch (in indesign, quark or whatever), its your work, not his. would you pay this other designer because your grid derived from his? no.</div>

I could 'ave sworn I said that...

" the etiquette of showing others where the inspiration came from"
I'm lost. Etiquette, really has nothing to do with it. I think the word you're looking for is honesty, forthrightedness, or "being upfront," about saying Y-type is based on X-type.

"Perhaps Arial should have referred to Helvetica or Grotesque, but it didn’t. Some fonts do try to show the influence." ?

I did not realize how poor were my writing skills for short communications until I read the autobiography of U.S. Grant, a master in the early age of instant communications. He was one of the first to realize how screwed up the telegraph could make things if the message was fast, but unclear. : - )
