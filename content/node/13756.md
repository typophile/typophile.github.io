  [[RIT|Rochester Institute of Technology]] Wallace Library is home to the <a href=\"http://wally.rit.edu/cary/\">Melbert
  B. Cary Jr. Graphic Arts Collection</a>, curated by [[David Pankow]].  The Cary
  Collection is one of the country's premier libraries on the history and practice
  of printing. In 1969, the Cary Collection was presented to RIT by the Mary Flagler
  Cary Charitable Trust as a memorial to Mr. Cary. Today the library houses some 20,000
  volumes and a growing number of manuscripts and correspondence collections. Also
  included are impressive holdings on bookbinding, papermaking, type design, calligraphy
  and book illustration. The goal of developing the digital image database is to enable
  users all over the world to sample the wealth of rich materials housed in the collection.\r\n\r\nURL:
