  Welo</strong>, author of <em>The Studio Handbook: Letter and Design</em>? And, while
  I'm at it, any info on his publisher, <strong>Frederick Drake &amp; Co.</strong>,

  body: 'I  own three books published by Frederick Drake and Company, "The Studio
    Handbook" (1927) and " Practical Lettering, Modern and Foreign" (1946) by Samuel
    Welo and "Modernistic Lettering & Design"( 1929) by Alphonso E. Tripp ( This last
    item is really a set of plates in a folder, some lettering and some design material.)
    I like Nick would love to know more about Drake and his authors (artists) '
