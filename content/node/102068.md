  book. The subject matter is partly about indigenous people and the wild, and I'm
  having a hard time settling on the typeface.\r\n\r\nIf you had to pick a bookface
  that exemplified wild grace -- not the grace of a ballerina, but the grace of a
  mountain lion, dirt and burrs and all -- what would you suggest? To me, it seems
  like there should be a slight edge to it, just a bit rugged, in its tone if not
  its actual forms.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n-The book has a high word count, long stretches
  of text: needs to read comfortably for the long run.\r\n-No subheads. I don't really
  think I need a bold weight at all. It would be nice to have something with a light
  or display weight.\r\n-I prefer humanist models, though I wouldn't say that's absolute.
  Not a big fan of high-contrast faces.\r\n-A face that is decently tested, and has
  something of a track record already; I am totally not qualified to be making a whole
  lot of adjustments.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts appreciated, any questions welcomed.\r\n\r\nThanks!
  Have fun with it.\r\n"

  body: "Great -- interesting stuff.\r\n\r\nFor me, Chaparral is definitely powerful,
    but not what I'd call graceful. It's more like a linebacker.\r\n\r\nI'd been thinking
    of Beorcana, so I like the suggestions of Hiroshige Sans and Lucca. I might be
    more drawn to the standard Hiroshige (from what I can tell on screen, which isn't
    a hell of a lot). Lucca has a lot in common with Beorcana, but I like the greater
    angularity of the italic. Very new!\r\n\r\nHas anyone seen Beorcana on paper in
    an extended setting? I know there's a book of poetry out there, though I haven't
    seen it in person. I'm interested in impressions of its readibility.\r\n\r\nI'm
    also considering Maiola, Seria, and maybe Roman\xE9e. I don't know if the last
    two have that feral touch I'm looking for, but they have their own grace."

    as well. \r\n\r\nUnless the typeface is more important than the story, with the

    I once suffered through a noir detective story set in Palatino...it was never

    of World War II brought to you via Adobe Jenson (again with the Renaissance).\r\n\r\nIf

  body: "BTW, if this is self-publishing, your troubles are just starting. You're
    going to need print-bind work. In my somewhat less than humble opinion, printing
    with the offset press is still superior to any xerographic technique, at least
    for text.\r\n\r\nOffset short-run book production now goes down to as few as 500
    copies, maybe less. Short-run book printing is a specialty.\r\n\r\nYou'll want
    to use a house sheet, for cost reasons. Probably that will be Gladfelter's Natures
    Natural, most places stock that. Unless you have a lot of images, and they are
    extremely important, avoid a white sheet like the black death.\r\n\r\nConsidering
    all the inevitable compromises, the \"best\" short-run printer I know of now isn't
    in Michigan, but North Carolina. Long way to ship to Oregon.\r\n\r\nCall the University
    of Washington Press, and in the production department, ask for Tom or Pam. I'll
    get you last names if you need them.  As quickly as possible describe your project
    -- esp. number of copies needed,  and ask them for a short-run printer they'd
    use. If it's Thomson-Shore, that's back to Michigan. OK, but get two other quotes.
    Include Edward Brothers/Lillington (North Carolina) in the quotes. Sheridan will
    be cheaper, but how should I say this, they \"work best\" with experienced people?\r\n\r\nIf
    Washington can recommend someone on the west coast, consider that printer carefully,
    it will save you a bunch in shipping costs.\r\n\r\nFrode was (maybe still is)
    a typesetter. If you prefer his font to Huronia, just tell him what sheet (paper)
    you'll print on, and he'll advise you as to the best weight of the fonts to purchase.
    Trust him, he will know. \r\n\r\nIf you prefer Huronia, what you get is just fine
    for an uncoated sheet, printed offset."

    you could print the digital version (isn't there one?) letterpress (with photopolymer

  body: "Wow, great suggestions.\r\n\r\nSatyr: amazing. In one sense, with all the
    curves, it seems kind of soft, and my feeling for wild grace is that the face
    might be a little harder, leaner. But the other opposition here is between the
    straight lines of industry and modernity, and the arcs of the earth. (The irony
    isn't lost on me that I'm looking for something wild in one of the most detailed
    and machined of the arts.) I'm going to have to sit with that one for a while.\r\n\r\nHuronia:
    Y'know, I never looked too closely at that face before, but now it's starting
    to show me something. Nice nominee.\r\n\r\nTrinit\xE9: Oh, I thought about it.
    Just the price on narrow face, regular weight roman & italic: well, I'll see if
    I can get some charitable contributions towards a poor, deserving book project.
    I actually hadn't looked for a digital Roman\xE9e yet, and if it's not available,
    that's fine, I'm not wedded to it.\r\n\r\nOn mixing Italian Renaissance with the
    subject, I'm not set on a humanist face, I just tend to like the proportions.
    And the subject of the book really goes back before printing, back before writing
    even, so there's no \"appropriate\" historical connection. It's kind of a fun
    challenge, really: how to evoke a wild world, not draw undue attention to the
    typeface, and try to foster an illusion that's it's not really being printed at
    all...\r\n\r\nAnd Charles, thanks for all the info on printing the thing. I don't
    look on the design as troubles, but I'm prepared to beat down the printing if
    it so much as looks at me cross-eyed. Or maybe whimper in a corner, I don't know
    yet. I had to read your post three or four times just to make sure I understood
    what you were telling me. The initial print run will probably be around 1000 copies,
    and I'm intrigued to look at printing it offset; not so intrigued to be working
    with a printer across the country, I'm usually a little more hands-on. I'll have
    to do a lot more research; I may have a few more questions, if you're willing.\r\n\r\nThanks,
    everyone."

    things have changed radically in the past year -- which I doubt -- with 1,000
    copies, your unit cost will be significantly lower with offset printing. Your
    quality will be significantly better, too."
