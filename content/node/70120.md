    with the triangles cut out (and I agree it's a pretty smart and nice effect!)
    but once you zoom in to that Flash, this has curves that I'd hope aren't in any
    commercially available font :-\\\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/barubti-R_6517.png]\r\n(Or
    can Flash be to blame for mangling curves like that?)"

  body: "Thanks guys / gals!\r\n\r\nI was thinking it was custom as well... just seems
    like it could be a font (without zooming in, that is). Figured it couldn't hurt
    to run it by the forum.\r\n\r\n"
