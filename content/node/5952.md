    on the P and R are kinda small.

  body: The glyphs are mostly very solid, but to me the only interesting character
    there is the &#34;R&#34;. If you can carry that spirit thoughout the font &#40;for
    example in the &#34;A&#34; by lowering its bar a lot&#41;, you should end up with
    something pretty nice. Otherwise I fear the font will basically a good exercise
    for learning how to make a text font - useful, but mostly only to you. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Hrant, with your last remark you make it sound as if it was a bad thing! To
    make a good text typeface I need to learn how to make it. Perhaps you know some
    other methods?

  body: The abrupt change in curvature between the straight strokes and arc in the
    U bothers me a bit. These curvature discontinuities are typical of fonts designed
    on the computer screen using Bezier curves, but aren&#39;t that difficult to fix
    once you&#39;re aware of them.

  body: 'I think that a possible way to learn to design text typefaces is to try to
    design words instead of letters, always watching a preview on your screen and
    printing often text in small size, but not using always the same words &#40;it&#39;s
    obvious&#41;.  <BR>You can choose some words and work on them until the single
    letters work, then change the words, to see if there is any problem.  <BR>Maybe
    I said you too much... <BR> <BR>In my opinion the serifs are too small for a text
    typeface.  <BR>I think the letters, apart R and P, are now too bare and &#34;standard&#34;,
    you could emphasize the shapes, while you look for the right proprotion.  <BR>Waiting
    for the lowercase. '

    we do all learn in different ways, but I tend to think that taking risks &#40;as
    opposed to emulating precedent&#41; accelerates things. Making mistakes is the
