  body: "Hmm. It ain't ever quite that simple. If the sizes used are similar, you'll
    have to take a close look, as to weight, as to compatibility. If the sizes are
    quite different, almost anything reasonable works.\r\n\r\nI do think if I were
    using an OpenSource font like Gentium & wanted a sans, I'd pay close attention
    to Lato\r\n\r\nhttp://www.latofonts.com/\r\n\r\nWhich in it's own right is an
    excellent font family. That it's free & open source is just gravy.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    when we've used Gentium, we've found the Book -- available only in basic-- has
    better weight for text for our uses, which includes both print and the smaller
    size tablets, such as the Kindle Fire & Android phones. "

    choice always depends on context:\r\nWhat is it about?\r\nWho is it for?\r\nHow
    much text?\r\nWhat kinds of illustrations?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Thanks for the comments!\r\nIt is a philosophy book, about 250 pages with
      much technical stuff like formulas, arguments, blocquotes etc. and many (really:
      6!) levels of headings; which is why I need some means to distinguish them without
      getting too messy and Myriad offers that (and it is not so cold and sterile
      as most sans-serifs, which is why it seems to me that it might work well with
      Gentium). No illustrations, just 2 diagrams; intended for philosophy of religion
      nerds. The choice of Gentium is determined by the house style of the publisher.
      Yes, I am using the \"Book\" version. "

  body: "I think it's OK, but I would test Gentium/Source Sans and Gentium/Tisa Sans
    combinations.\r\n\r\nA possible issue is the need of special characters in headings,
    so check if the sans does offer them."

    perhaps a more cold, sterile look would be exactly right. If this is academic
    Anglo-American philosophy, often the authority of a \"sterile\" sans would be
    more in keeping with the discipline than a humanistic one. Metaphysics has been
    banished, don't you know (not to mention all that soft, soapy stuff...).\r\n\r\nKnowing
    the subject matter, you might take a look at Thomas Phinney's <strong>Hypatia
    Sans</strong>. Yes, I know there is a humanistic element in Hypatia, but the geometric
    element might go well with the topic, and I think will work nicely with Gentium.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/hypatia/hypatia.html\r\n\r\n<cite>Edit:</cite>\r\n\r\nAs
    I remember, there is no bold for Gentium. Depending, you may feel this lack if
    there are many formal propositions in the text... Not too many proofs use bold,
    but occasionally it is needed. If the publisher want's to stick to Open Source,
    Charis may suit the text better -- though I'm not sure it has all the needed logical/mathematical
    operators. The publisher needs to either inform you of the requirements of the
    text, or pay you to go through it & discover them. Good luck with it,\r\n\r\n"

    body: 'Thanks, Charles, I will consider Hypatia Sans, I quite like it. But as
      you mention it: Metaphysics has been banished some 90 years ago, and a lot has
      happened since then :-) This book in fact places itself in the nowadays already
      thriving metaphysics-revival strand. If there is a kind of impression I would
      like to avoid, it is the sterility of Carnapian and Quinean anti-metaphysicalism.'

    do, both bold and bold italic.

  body: "<blockquote>This book in fact places itself in the nowadays already thriving
    metaphysics-revival strand.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nMetaphysics never went away --
    it just migrated over to the English department, under the guise of deconstructivism,
    etc. Are you saying it is now moving back to academic philosophy?\r\n\r\n& a reminder,
    the usual caution in designing is to select fonts that will make the reader comfortable.
    Nothing like an old, familiar pair of shoes to make you pull out the wallet &
    buy the book (to mix a metaphor). If you want to \"challenge\" a reader (an oft-heard
    remark by people who teach design, but do not hire out), write your own damn book.
    While the reader (buyer & hopefully enjoyer) is usually the most important member
    of the audience, if something is written by a famous author, or an author the
    publisher wants more work from, by all means consider their preferences. Finally,
    remember the title page is for you (as designer), the author, and esp. the author's
    mother. Have fun, no one else will comment on it..."

    body: "Sorry for the drop-out, too busy...\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments. I
      would never call that thing in the English departments a \"Metaphysics\". But
      yes: there is a metaphysics - and I mean real metaphysics, of the Plato-Aristotle-Aquinas
      style - revival in philosophy ever stronger since the 60's. But back to typography:
      I have no ambition to \"challenge\" anyone through type; I just want the typography
      to be good: as good as possible with my limited means. For my profession (I
      mean the one I am paid for) too is not typesetting but writing philosophy books
      :-)\r\n\r\nI have settled on keeping the Myriad as my sans-serif font; here
      is a specimen of the result:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/specimen_3705.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
      everybody for your feedback!"
