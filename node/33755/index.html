  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>As if I don’t have enough to think about with my senior year of design school coming on, my SO and I are considering moving to the Bay Area after I graduate. Seeing as how the design environment on the West Coast is rather different from the starched-and-stuffy East Coast, I’m starting to inform myself on what it takes to work out there.</p>
<p>How hard is it to find a steady job in San Francisco or Palo Alto? Should I consider lining up an internship to cover me right after graduation and look for a full-time job after I arrive? What are starting salaries out there like-AIGA/Aquent list the median for entry-level as $40,000, but with only 13 respondents I don’t really trust that number. Is it easier to get hired there as an entry-level designer or with a few year’s of experience? I know that I won’t have a hard time finding some kind of job in Washington, so if the job market out west sucks I can always wait a few years.</p>
<p>And how is the Bay area in terms of post-graduate design education? I’ll probably want to start on an MFA in design in a few years, is the Bay area a good place for that? Also, am I correct in believing that there are good type design classes out there? I would like to start doing more type design (I just started my first font) and I would like to learn from others without moving to the UK.</p>
