<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I hope this is fitting for this forum. It's more logo-related than logo-type-related, but seeing the great critiques here compelled me to post. Plus, I'm the only graphic designer in the building, so it helps to get other's input. <br> <br>This is a logo for our branch of government here in MN. I've come up with 3 variations that I (and a few others) seem to think are the strongest. I now need your harsh, honest critiques! <br> <br>There's one disclaimer, and one I'll probably take some heat for saying...but I an limited to only free fonts and whatevers on my machine (gasp!). As our state is in the hole a few billion, getting darrel a few licensed fonts isn't really on the priority list. <br> <br>So, here they are. <br> <br>Logo one (uses Tanek, from CSA) represents the state (duh) and the 10 court districts rendered in a stained-glass-like way. This also hints at the stained glass ceiling installation in the supreme court. PROS: nice double-meaning, simple CONS: not as nice in one-color. <br> <br>Logo two (uses Futura, from Apple, and Covington, from apostrophiclab) is the more 'elegant' of the bunch (if not just a bit hokey). It's the state bird perched upon a roman column. (bird = MN, column = courhouse) PROS: most 'regal' of the bunch CONS: is it hokey? (Most have said 'no' but I still wonder...) <br> <br>Logo three (uses Futura, from Apple) is a simple rendering of common iconography...the state and the scales of justice. PROS: recognizable iconography CONS: cliche? Too trendy? <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7047.gif alt="Logos (GIF)"> <br> <br>now, let me have it!</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like all of these, Darrel. I'd go with the bottom right. <br>If you go with #1 you have some kerning to do. The <br>"MN" is tucked into the 'J', but the "BRANCH" is not <br>into the 'L'. Maybe that was on purpose, but it distracts.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'd be concerned in the third option about misinterpretation: 'In Minnesota, the road to justice is a crooked one'. <br> <br>What about blindfolding the majestic loon and hanging a scale off each wing? Just kidding! <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with Stephen, #3 is very nice. But, if <br>you decide on number #2, I'd try some other <br>font variations. The Futura/Covington combo <br>isn't working for me. <br> <br>You may also want to simplify the illustration <br>a bit and fine-tune the logotype to work as one <br>solid unit. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The loon is just looney. The third one is too artsy. I think the first one is the nicest, and the b&w version could just dump the districts, or render them as lines. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>#1 has a good concept, but the execution is too... Well, <br>too CSA, and is inappropriate. I'm sure there are better <br>ways to execute an illustration here. Think fine-etched <br>engraving (like money perhaps). <br> <br>#2 is the only one that seems appropriate for a judicial <br>branch. The pillar is a better (less obvious) way to say <br>'law' than the scales of justice. That said, the pillar is still <br>obvious. Is there a classy way to render the loon, so it's <br>not so cartoony? <br> <br>#3 is way too trendy. The color, the illustration stlye, <br>even the subject matter is ultra-obvious (which is why <br>you've rendered it this way, I'm guessing). I'd avoid this <br>direction, even though, we could all guess that the <br>client asked for it. <br> <br>Best of luck.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey guys...thanks for all of the critiques! This is helping. <br> <br>To respond to some of the comments... <br> <br>> you have some kerning to do <br> <br>Yea, I really need to work on all of the type on these...I just set them as-is for now. <br> <br>> I'd be concerned in the third option about <br>> misinterpretation: 'In Minnesota, the road <br>> to justice is a crooked one'. <br> <br>Do you think people would read that much into it? It's an interesting observation. <br> <br>> The loon is just looney. <br>and <br>> is the only one that seems appropriate <br>> for a judicial branch. <br> <br>*sigh*...that's been my dilema. I'll think I'll let the client decide on this one ;o) <br> <br>> 1 has a good concept, but the <br>> execution is too... Well, too CSA <br> <br>Ha! There's a reason for that. I had a buddy over at CSA critique it and suggest a lot of what you see there...not to mention that (coincidently) the face I was using was from CSA as well. ;o) <br> <br>I have some other variations of that that I'll work on...the fine-etched engraving idea is a good one. <br> <br>> Is there a classy way to render the loon, <br>> so it's not so cartoony? <br> <br>Do you think it's the illustration style, or the fact that it's just a loon? I'll work on that some more. <br> <br>> #3 is way too trendy...even though, we could all guess that the client asked for it. <br> <br>It kind of goes without saying that one of the options needs to be a state/scales of justice. Yea, it's incredibly cliche, so I tried to at least have fun with it. I do have several other style variations that I'll post when I get the chance for comparison. <br> <br>> I think the logo has to say strength and durability. <br> <br>Could you say a bit more about that Brennan? I assume you were referring to the column logo. Were you referring to the style? Line weight? <br> <br>Again, thanks everyone. I'll try and post some more this afternoon (if not new stuff, some of the sketches up to this point...) <br> <br>-Darrel <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Far out! <br> <br>I like #1, but it's definitely unorthodox. But if it works with the attitude of Minnesota and the state's other identity schemes, go for it. <br> <br>The spot colours in the stained glass part will look neat overprinted like that. <br> <br>I'm not sure I like the choice of fonts in that one. <br> <br>I agree with Hrant: the black-and-white version should leave out the stained glass bits altogether. <br> <br>Paul</div>

<div class=commentbody>> Well, the way I see it is that the Judicial system <br>> is about strength against criminality. <br> <br>That's just one part of it. Criminal court is just a segment of the court system. There's juveniles, divorces, bankruptcies, child support, etc. So it's more about 'fairness for all' than the courts being 'against' anything in particular. <br> <br>That doesn't mean it shouldn't be a 'strong' mark, though. ;o) <br> <br>>But if it works with the attitude of <br>>Minnesota and the state's other identity <br>>schemes, go for it. <br> <br>Well, in some ways I am fortunate in that I'm starting from scratch. There really aren't any departments with an identity (except for maybe the tourism board). <br> <br>Well, I was hoping to have new stuff to post, but the project has been side tracked this week. I did promise something, so here are some of the logo variations prior to the ones above... <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7179.gif alt> <br> <br>No need to comment on them (unless you want to). I just thought I'd post some of the steps in the process thus far...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, four months later, and here's what we are close to going with: <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13400.gif alt="final court logo"> <br> <br>Of course, as many of you have pointed out (and as I've always known) if you show a client multiple options, they'll always choose the least interesting of the bunch. I did try and simplify it a bit so it wasn't quite as trendy and hopefully the lock-up in a color block will be used consistently. We'll see. ;o) I still need to tweak the kerning and such. <br> <br>Thanks for all of the advice everyone! <br> <br> <br></div>
