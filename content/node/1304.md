  body: Hey, it was an easy one and I happened to be checking Typophile just when
    Mike posted his question. <BR> <BR>&#40;Yves, I would participate more on the
    TIB--I&#39;m sure I could hold my own there with rest of you--but I&#39;d never
    get anything else done! ;-&#41;

  body: A lot of places are using Minion and Myriad now...even Apple seems to be using
    them now.  Our local news paper, The Orlando Sentinel, uses Minion and Myriad
    as well.
