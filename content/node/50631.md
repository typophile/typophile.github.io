body: "The Adobe Media Player came bundled with the Adobe Reader 9 download recently.
  Having taken it for a spin, it appears to replicate what's available at http://tv.adobe.com,
  only in an Adobe AIR wrapper so as to masquerade as a desktop application, apparently.
  \r\n\r\nI was struck by the typeface used in the Media Player, and at Adobe TV\u2014it's
  not Cronos, or even Thomas Phinney's Hypatia Sans, the most-recent sans serif from
  Adobe. What could it be? \r\n\r\nI took a look at the lower-case \"l,\" and it appears
  to match up with the lower-case \"l\" in the \"Fl\" CS3/CS4 icon for Flash. I think
  that the font in question must be Robert Slimbach's forthcoming tentatively-titled
  Gauge.\r\n\r\nI rather like it\u2014and can't wait to see what the entire family
  looks like.\r\n\r\nAnother usage of the purported Gauge appears on Adobe's Experience
  Design Team's blog, at [[http://xd.adobe.com]]. That site, like Adobe TV, is constructed
  in Flex, and uses Flash to render on-screen. (Viewing the site with the Flash 10
  player shows off the enhanced anti-aliasing as compared with Flash 9, BTW.) Some
  folks have quibbled with the site's usability\u2014creating it in Flex/Flash takes
  away some HTML/browser usefulness with regards to navigation and accessibility\u2014but
  the visual effect is wonderful (especially being able to embed all the fonts, and
  not resorting to using the SiFR workaround with HTML for setting headlines, for
  instance).\r\n\r\nSo\u2014do you think the typeface is Slimbach's forthcoming Gauge?\r\n\r\n\u2014Kent"

    The reason I said what I did is that woven into the fabric of Clean there is just
    a certain melody or sensibility I felt like it they shared with Underground as
    a result of some forms and the low contrast. For example: the g in Clean does
    not share a shape with Underground at all. The are different at the script or
    stroke level! On the other hand there seems to be an an urge to a tempered geometric
    reductionism which is also present in Johnston''s Underground.'
