  at least, that Rotis is on the list of the eight least-liked typefaces in a poll

    London Olympics, manages to make Comic Sans look good.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can imagine
    what they were thinking of.\r\n\r\nThey wanted to have a less obviously Greek
    typeface that still echoed such faces as Paestum."

    means designers still care for type, at least.\r\n:)"

  body: "You can tell this was written before the actual olympics. The 2012 London
    font was extremely effective as branding during the games, iconic and instanty
    recognisable. But I guess it did split opinions right down the middle, that one
    :)\r\n\r\n(You can also tell the survey was done before the current \"normcore\"-style
    reembrace of TNR et al. A lot of designers these days use the standard MS Word
    fonts because, not despite, their ubiquity.)"

    fonts are those poorly produced with programmatic errors or lacking significant
    features."

  body: Although the round O was jarring, one thing I noticed about 2015 Headline
    was that for a strange-looking display typeface, it was surprisingly readable.
    So one has to give them points for that, at least.

  body: That's true, but one can discuss poor typefaces with a list of only eight
    examples. Showing the ways in which typefaces can be misused would require more
    examples; even forty-two of them would not be enough.
