  of two existing fonts. I chose Eurostile & Eames Century Modern to create a sort
  of 'Americana-Thick-Meets-Outer-Space-Clean' kind of display face. If you could
  give me any suggestions or critique for what I've got so far, that would be great!\r\n"

  body: "Interesting choice. The result is still too much (or not enough, depending
    on the goal) Frankentein-ish.\r\nBy the way, have you seen this?\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100036"

  body: Hmm. Well, it's kind of all over the place and still clearly a chimera. Problems
    of weight distribution aren't applied consistently. I think if you started with
    a lighter weight, like medium, you would have more success blending the features
    together. It would give you room to exhibit the squareness of Eurostile in letters
    like n where there is no room to do so now.
