  on increments of a strict grid sub-unit, or do most people simply decide on the
  margins, number of columns and gutter size and let the columns fall as they may?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help."

  body: Not sure I understand what you mean by "columns fall as they may". When you
    pick margins, number of columns, etc. you are determining precisely where the
    columns will be.

  body: "thanks, James,\r\n\r\nyes, but they won't fall on even, pre-established grid
    units, for instance, 12 point gutters and columns in multiples of 12 points. I
    personally don't see that this is a problem, but I have heard of people referring
    to this as the way a real grid is built."

    the layout. If you're asking if you can just put stuff wherever you want, then
    sure. Though that's not a grid, then. That's just putting stuff wherever. ;)\r\n\r\nIf
    you are asking if grids are still popular, then 'yes'. They're a core tool in
    the graphic designer's toolbox. "

  body: I'm not asking either of those things. I'm asking if there is any value to
    placing horizontal grid modules squarely on increments derived from a base unit
    (such as the baseline grid)

  body: "So, for example, if your baselines are 12 points apart, does each column
    need be a multiple of 12 points wide? Is that what you're asking?\r\n\r\nI guess
    my viewpoint is that grids are essential for adding structure to a layout, but
    since the reader isn't going to pull out a ruler and measure everything, it ultimately
    comes down to how it looks. \r\n\r\nIf your mathematically precise grid looks
    great, then use it.  But if you're trying to use a 12 point grid but the columns
    look better if they are 15 points apart, then go with what looks better, as long
    as you're consistent about it."

  body: thanks, that was what I was asking. I had an exchange with someone who said  a
    grid isn't as fundamentally solid or sound if you don't lock the horizontal divisions
    onto increments of a base unit, but my feeling is that that's kind of arbitrary,
    given that there's no equivalent of a baseline grid that the eye looks to align
    to

  body: "I've always thought it'd be a good idea for InDesign to have more options
    on their margins/columns/gutter setup dialog. As it stands you can choose the
    margin and gutter size and number of columns, and you get whatever column width
    fits. It might be useful to be able to choose, say, column and gutter width and
    number of columns and either right or left margin and have it calculate the other
    margin for you (or choose margins and column width and have it calculate the gutter
    width for you). At least that way you wouldn't be doing math with a pencil on
    the back of an envelope to get the column width you want.\r\n\r\nSometimes I use
    guides instead, and draw my column text boxes to those. I'm no expert though."
