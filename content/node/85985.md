  the ttf in a browser with @font-face all the characters appear as expected apart
  from the small-caps.\r\n\r\nI have tested in all browsers on a mac, some produce
  false small-caps but none of them appear to use the small-caps in the font.\r\n\r\nIs
  there something I need to do with the font for a browser to use the font's small-caps
  ?\r\n\r\n\r\nttmt"

  body: You need to have them in a separate font for now, until true small caps are
    supported in the most common browsers.

  body: Currently, the best option is to put the small-caps (and maybe some alternate
    numerals and stuff) into a separate font file (one for each style/weight, naturally)
    and refer to it in a CSS class using <code>font-family</code> instead of <code>font-variant</code>.
    Troublesome, but since the only user yau can make any assumptions abous is yourveryownself...
