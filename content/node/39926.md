  with an eco slant. It should be something that isn't overly masculine - no heavy
  sans faces - and distressed faces are out too.\r\n\r\nIt's not a newstand title
  as such so there isn't that need to punch out from the shelf and perhaps this allows
  me leeway to pick something with a little  more personality.\r\n\r\nHave looked
  at what seems like a million typefaces and so far I'm stumped so any suggestions
  would be gladly received!\r\n\r\n "

    a good [[lettering artists|lettering artist]]\r\n\r\nthere are several good lettering
    artists, and [[Mark Simonson]] listed quite a few in a recent thread. Mark himself
    is an excellent letterer. i'll see if i can't find that thread..."
