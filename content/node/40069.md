  some critiques/ suggestions about what I could do to make it better? The gallery
  is wallpaper designing/ board designing that I been working on now for some time.
  I know its hard to give critiques because you have no clue what sort of designing
  im doing. So i would appreciate any critiques/suggestions about this logo!\r\n\r\nCheers.

  body: "Hi Ted ... It looks like the bowl on the R forms a 3 ... or is that an ampersand?\r\n\r\nThat
    concept could work, but you should try to match the weight and stress of the typeface.\r\n\r\n\r\nother
    suggestions:\r\n\r\n* the bottom floral assortment feels stretched, and the gradient
    really doesn't help distinguish it.\r\n* The clover shape inside the O feels like
    more of an afterthought than anything.\r\n* seems redundant to say Trifolium twice.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe
    see if you can pull of the TR portion to match the rest, and go from there?\r\n\r\nabout
    the only suggestions i can muster right now. best of luck.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Looks nice, but it's too complicated in my opinion. It took me about 3 full
    seconds to read \"Trifolium\", which is probably too long. Also, the green in
    the clover shape is too weak, almost unrecognisable for the human eye, especially
    on white background.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Web Design Hamburg]]"

  body: I would suggest that you get a type designer to customize the letterforms.
    The rest of it might be okay but the letters look tortured. Also confusing. The
    R seems to be part B! If you really do want to it yourself I am sure folk here
    will tell you how.

  body: this is somewhat interesting, but too complex for a logo. what if you just
    removed all the vinework?

  body: Not all logos have to simple... Especially now. But the Vinework will need
    help too. And I would be sure to make a version without shading to start with.

  body: The thing's called "Trifolium", yet there is a 4 leafed clover in the design.
    That doesn't seem right, now does it? It would be easier to drop a leaf than to
    change the name.

  body: not all logos need to be simple, but they can still be too complex. all that
    meandering ivy is taking over and swallowing up any message of name/typography
    (in my opinion).

  body: "It reads <em>Fri</em> folium. Great name for a fast food restaurant (with
    good fries). Perhaps removing the stroke that crosses the Upper case 'T' would
    clear up any readability/legibility issues.\r\n\r\nI would suggest also removing
    the gradient/bevel/shadow/3D (whatever people call it nowadays) effects on the
    prefix <em>Tri</em>. Emphasis can be established on this using more simple methods. "

  body: i don't particularly like te Unilever logo, but -- and maybe i'm arguing semantics
    here -- i think there's a difference between 'intricate' and 'complex.'  all the
    <em>details </em>of the Unilever bit come together to form something cohesive,
    and, ultimately, simple.

  body: "Chuck I think we agree then. Fundamentally. Mostly.\r\n\r\nWhatever a logo/identity
    is -  it has to cohere & have an impact. Or perhaps better - have a result that
    is the desired one. \r\n\r\nWhen you expand from logo into identity boundriess
    can be allowed to blur & squish with success I think. But again with the proviso
    that they cohere. And by cohere I don't even mean that they share a style - nothing
    that formal - just that ultimately the impact you get is the one you want. \r\n\r\nThe
    messier/more complex things are the richer they <cite>can</cite> be.  But richness
    can also create more & more opportunities for failure or simple mediocrity.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the reasons I love great typography is that it is one of the all time great
    tools for pulling an identity together & giving just the spin you want. \r\n\r\nI
    also don't think that a logo has to to resolve into something even as simple as
    The Unilever logo. But I think it is often advisable. And it's even advisable
    to avoid the complexity altogether unless you are really on top of your game.
    And even then.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is a long way to go to try to suggest that
    Trifolium could have lots of flourishes and still cohere. So far it doesn't. \r\n\r\nChuck's
    advice is sound. Going simpler might help especially if they number of elements
    you have is getting hard to control."

  body: "I'm a \"less is more\" kind of guy, so here go my four cents:\r\n\r\n\u2022
    I'd keep it simpler. Lose the vines (I imagine your wallpaper design is very complex/intricate,
    which would contrast nicely with a simple logo). Not too sure about the \"TR\"
    treatment...\r\n\r\n\u2022 Use a three-leaf clover as cuttlefish suggested (I
    understand you wanting to use the four\u2013leaf version, as it's more desirable/popular,
    but makes more sense not to).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Set it in two lines instead of one
    (this would let you increase the size in any application).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Solid
    color\r\n\r\nGood luck, and post a link to your gallery's website sometime (I'd
    love to see what you're up to).\r\n\r\n"
