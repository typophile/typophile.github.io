  a few questions for any familiar with the area.\r\n\r\n1) What are some <strong>great</strong>
  firms located in the Chicago area? Links?\r\n\r\n2) Where would you recommend living?
  I'm basically looking for a studio @ $1000~ a month...\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help
  me out, it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike"

    you're looking for. Are you looking for graphic design work? Print production
    work? Do you want to work in advertising? For a book publisher? A magazine?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
