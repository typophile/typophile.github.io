  body: 'Hey June, <BR> <BR>I think the best you can do is read some books on the
    subject. <BR>There are some wonderful specimens out there. <BR> <BR><i>Elements
    of Typographic Style</i> by <b>Robert Bringhurst </b>is the first that comes to
    my mind.  <BR> <BR>Amazon link: <BR><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0881791326/qid=1076442246//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-0860516-9368748?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846"

    <BR>I think it&#39;s a very nice introduction to the wonderful and weird world
    of typography. <BR> <BR>Also, a large number of outstanding typographic books
    can be find on this site too; see: <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/books/archives/1%20Essentials.html"

    <BR> <BR>Oh, and don&#39;t start too early with those pesky computers... There
    are some nice &#34;manual&#34; ways to start a typography student&#39;s career...'
