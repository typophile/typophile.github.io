    haven't seen the thing (which is why I asked that question). Maybe\r\nthat claim
    is bogus, dunno. But I'm curious, does a redesign necessarily\r\ncause a readership
    drop? And what time period are we talking about?\r\nI mean, the guarantee of getting
    complaint letters is basically due\r\nto human nature, but don't we expect good
    design to bring increased\r\nreadership, eventually? I thought Kevin was carried

  body: "The Grauniad is a (now largely affection) nickname for The Guardian, which
    used to be notorious for its misspellings. I don't think they still have the reputation,
    but the name has stuck.\r\n\r\nThe point of Kevin's presentation in Helsinki was
    about the relationship between the pleasurable aesthetic experience of typography
    and measurable increase in cognitive performance, based on related work in which
    people are found to perform problem solving tasks more easily and quickly after
    an enjoyable mental experience such as watching an amusing video rather than a
    dry lecture. So not directly related to the crapshoot of trying to increase readership
    in a competetive newspaper market."

    redesign, at least fontwise (I'm not qualified\r\nto judge it otherwise) was stellar
    - so I personally wouldn't use it\r\nas a reference point. Anyway it's more useful
    to compare papers that\r\nare in the same arena. And what's interesting here is
    that France\r\nis becoming more conservative (mostly in a bad way) so switching\r\nfrom
    de Groot's stuff* to Fenway seems to make sense. Even though\r\nit's kinda sad
    too.\r\n\r\n* I mean the heads.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the '60s\r\n\r\nReading it daily after the redesign, I came to be really impressed
    with the typeface and the redesign, although there were a couple of things that
    bothered me (in the paper, not the face). They were outweighed by the brilliance,
    though.\r\n\r\nAt first, I didn't take to it, and I think that's why there are
    usually letters from readers who don't like their habits disrupted. "
