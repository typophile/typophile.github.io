body: I spent about a day tracing some sketches in Illustrator and throwing together
  an incomplete font. <BR> <BR>The inspiration for this was some &#34;decorative Gothic
  capitals&#34; I saw in a calligraphy book.  The calligrapher had taken some artistic
  liberties and added curly-cues to the Gothic shapes.  I&#39;ve reinterpreted the
  shapes again, redrawn some completely, and this is the result. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
  like to know if the folks here think there&#39;s merit in this idea, and in developing
  the font further.  &#40;I know that the outlines are pretty rough right now&#41;

    historical forms, but not clinging to them fanatically. Have fun! '
