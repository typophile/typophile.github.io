  body: "|LITTLE MOON TWINS| appears to be a manually compressed setting of Bubblegum:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/bubblegum.font?text=LITTLEMOONTWINS\r\n\r\n|SIMS|
    is most likely a custom wordmark. The closest typeface I could find is Opel Sans
    Condensed Extra Bold, but it is a custom typeface and I can\u2019t find a commercial
    source for it:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-54817.html\r\n\r\nWith a little
    editing, Triplex by Emigre might work:\r\nhttp://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=128"
