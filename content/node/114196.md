body: "hello,\r\n\r\nmy magazine uses bembo for body copy, which i find a bit dated
  and better for book copy.\r\n\r\ncan anyone please recommend a more modern serif
  that works for body copy? Perhaps a little cleaner than Bembo.\r\n\r\nI am considering
  paring it with Museo (headlines) throughout the magazine. \r\n\r\nThe magazine has
  a dated look, so just looking for something more modern with a little more weight
  than Bembo, I find it light, wide and antiquated.\r\n\r\nIf you know of anything
  great, don't be afraid to suggest what it might pair with for headlines etc...\r\n\r\nI
  really appreciate any suggestions. Looking forward to some feedback."
