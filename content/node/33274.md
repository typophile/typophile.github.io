    this exists digitally. What leads you to believe it's not hand lettered, Stefan?\r\n<a

    is also similar."

  body: "To me the only obvious mismatch from FB Agency is the 't'. Agency exists
    in so many weights and widths that a little graphic manipulation could easily
    replicate this close enough that only a few of us could tell the difference, especially
    if they weren't side-by-side.\r\n\r\nI understood Stefan's remark to be that this
    <em> is</em> hand-lettered, but even if that's true, I think it could be very
    nearly replicated with Agency and some minor tweaking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    body: Both typefaces are similar, but they don't have that retro feel to them.
      I think the main difference is the x-hieght-- it's got a real low one that these
      don't have. Thanks for trying! (Anyone else???)

  body: "Next to the 't', also the 'e' is different. The 'e' of Agency has an angled
    cut-off corner in the middle-right/crossbar.\r\nBut I'm sure there are a lot of
    alternatives if the exact one isn't available digitally."
