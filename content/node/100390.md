  of the 19th century from England? It's rather specific, but hope many typographically-knowledged
  folk here would know of some.\r\n\r\nCheers all! "

  body: 'I think William Caslon IV''s "Two Line Egyptian" is generally considered
    the first sans-serif... it''s certainly English, and certainly 19th C.  Uppercase
    only, AFAIK.  I don''t know where you might find an implementation, though (if
    you need one, that is).  '

    body: Thank you very much! An implementation of it (or at least, a reinterpretation
      of it) may be required at a later stage. But currently, I'm gathering as much
      as I can. I've scoured the net and have only found a fair few.

    a sample halfway down this page.</a>
