    at AGFA_Monotype that comes pretty close, at least the lowercase letters. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>This one is slightly rounder though. You can actually see the alphabet
    at the search page: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.brandnewschool.com/search.php?"
    target="_blank">http://www.brandnewschool.com/search.php?</a> <BR> <BR>Would really
    appreciate your help!'

    <BR>but they have fiddled with it a bit in the header. <BR> <BR>Many, many thanks!

  body: Yves, the script with the uppercase in the second post is not the same font
    as the one that says &#39;brandnewschoolibrary&#39;. The full alphabet is probably
    one of the other ones you guys have mentioned. The first sample is not quite School
    Script from Agfa, as you can see by comparing them. look at the &#39;o&#39; and
    &#39;s&#39;, for example. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/34553.gif"
