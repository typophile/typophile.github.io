  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>My partner and I have been discussing moving out of Toronto for about a year now and we have decided moving somewhere in Europe would be ideal. He was born in Greece and speaks the language and has a lot of cultural ties there still so really wants to move back to Athens. I was born in Canada and my Greek is not -that- good and although this wouldn&rsquo;t be happening for at least another year and I would have time to work on it, is there really any chance of finding work in the design industry there if I don&rsquo;t speak the language fluently? Is it like that all over Europe?</p>
<p>My partner and I both work as Art Directors in interactive departments of advertising agencies.</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of European designers here who could maybe provide some insights for me. I really don&rsquo;t want to move to London.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s modern. Not nearly as modern as Berlin but pleny hooked up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of large companies so I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s pleny of work. The local joke is that the Germans own all of them.</p>
<p>The language seemed completely foreign to me. I have been in most of western Europe and there were almost always parts of the language I could understand but not there, or Scandinavia. The written language seems like it would definitely take some time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what you do but my job requires idiomatic knowledge of language, that&rsquo;s one of the hardest things to aquire and it takes the longest.</p>
<p>My friends from Berlin all want to leave now. They say it&rsquo;s getting a lot more stressful living there. It&rsquo;s a shame.</p>
<p>All I can say from LA is welcome to the club. :)</p>
<p>The Basques live on some of the best real estate on this earth. Bilbao perhaps?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are quite a few non-Finnish speakers here in Helsinki, and I think it would be possible to work in design without knowing the local languages. I know people who&rsquo;ve been here for decades and still don&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t speak the language. Houses are good and warm, infrastructure ok, air pretty clean and lots of nature around, even beaches. Downside is the climate, at the moment it&rsquo;s snowing and we won&rsquo;t see much sun for a few months from now. Summers are nice. As for swimming – my local beach offers a nice maintaned hole in the ice during the Winter months, so it&rsquo;s possible to swim in the sea around the year&hellip;</p>
<p>Actually, I suppose it&rsquo;s not that different to Toronto, except it&rsquo;s in Europe, there&rsquo;s the sea and people speak strange languages.</p>
<p>I lived in Munich for a year, and it was lovely. I was there only as a Hausfrau, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible to get a design job with my poor German skills. A Central European location is a good idea, if you want to visit other countries easily. From Munich we wisited Austria, Italy and Switzerland by train – very convienient.</p>

<p>Why not Istanbul? I&rsquo;ve been living here for more than 3 years. There&rsquo;s a huge amount of foreigners, including greek and canadians. Foreigners here are making an awful lot of money, providing they are good at what they do. Language is not a problem, there is a lot of work in graphic design, urban life is awesome, quality of life rather good, europe is an hour and a half away by plane, religion is not invasive.</p>

<p>I visited Istanbul on holiday a few years ago and fell in love with it and want to go back so badly. I was wondering how easy a move it was for you? Visa/job hunting/etc? The extent of my Turkish is basically &ldquo;Bir chai, lutfen!&rdquo;, so I would need to bone up on that =)</p>

<p>moving was not easy, i guess it never is anyway, to start a new life from scratch in a country you don&rsquo;t know. before thet i have been living 10 years in new york, 1 year in tokyo and 4 years in paris, but this was very different. it takes time to get fully used to this city, about 6 month. after that, its really very nice. to obtain a visa is very tricky and long, depending on your country: for french people, for example, you have to ask the working visa before you actually go and work there; that&rsquo;s really boring. i dont know for other countries, but french citizens can go and stay in turkey without any visa for 90 consecutive days, which is a blessing: you can go hunt for jobs, eventually find one, and ask the company&rsquo;s lawyers to get your visa (as in the USA), making things much faster done. job hunting is not very hard: just buy the newspaper hurriyet on sundays, that&rsquo;s where 95% of the ads are posted. you also might try a spontaneous job request by contacting the agencies here, there is a crazy amount of advertising / graphic design companies, both local or international. in 70% of the time, their creative directors or top art directors are foreigners. if your portfolio is good, they will call you, believe me. 3 major companies called me in the week following my emailing, 3 years ago, and it is still true today.</p>
<p>and to finish with the turkish language&hellip; i&rsquo;m ashamed to say that my turkish sucks, still now. i can chat, order food, talk about graphic design specifics&hellip; but that&rsquo;s pretty thin. i am even married to a turkish girl, but we speak english and she is learning french&hellip; so, dont be too much afraid: language is not too much of a problem (until you get in a taxi of course).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I lived in Germany from 2001–2002, and then again from 2003–2007. Now I&rsquo;m at Reading in the UK, but I&rsquo;ll be returning to Germany in late 2008. Both times in Germany, I was living near Frankfurt. It is possible to get work in Europe without speaking the native language, but you integrate so much better &amp; so much faster if you do learn it, and quickly. I love Berlin, but the job market there is rubbish, and the salaries low. From what I hear, designers make more there than in Athens, though, if that is consoling. Lots of people seem to like moving to the Netherlands. I think its cities must be quite cosmopolitan, and depending on what you are looking for, pleasant.</div>
