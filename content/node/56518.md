  body: "I reserve the term \u2018script\u2019 for typefaces that deliberately mimic
    handwriting, usually -- but not always -- with connecting letters. Although the
    Gabriola letters have a lot of flow to them and a distinctive pattern of entry
    and exit strokes, I think of them as essentially typographic forms, not handwritten
    ones.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018Flemish roots\u2019 to which James refers are really a
    kind of visual inspiration rather than a model for the letterforms. I was inspired
    by the look of things like this (by the master Jan van de Velde):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VDV_5728.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut
    both the shape of the letterforms and, crucially, their stroke modelling is very
    different. The Baroque Flemish writing masters used a broad nib which they rotated
    to produce a greater variety in the pattern of thick and thin strokes than had
    previously been done. Gabriola is based around an expansion stroke model, closer
    to that characteristic of a pointed split nib. I'll be talking about the reasons
    for this during my lecture at St Bride's later this month. The short reason is
    that the expansion stroke model is more flexible than the translation or rotation
    models."

  body: Ideally, we would be looking at Gabriola in Direct Write, which uses a combination
    of x-direction ClearType and y-direction greyscale antialiasing. This is how Gabriola
    was designed to be seen.

  body: "<cite>[it] looks as intended, with ClearType x-direction and greyscale y-direction

    rendering \u2013 \u201CClearType 2\u201D \u2013 was intended to be in Vista, but
    it was not included.* And looking to the screenshots of Windows 7, it is probably
    not going to be there either.\r\n\r\nWeb fonts are coming, and how will they look
    like in headlines? With jaggies (ClearType) or only with greyscale antialiasing.
    Both ways are certainly not the nicest.\r\n\r\n* By included I mean at least a
    user preference to turn it on, like it was ClearType in XP. Strictly speaking,
    it is included in Vista, but it can only be accessed by programs which were written
    specifically with the setting for this type of rendering."

  body: Yes, I wonder about this too. On the one hand, MS are pushing DirectWrite
    -- as well they should --, and I'm being hired to make fonts specifically with
    this technology in mind. On the other hand, even Microsoft's own major apps, especially
    Office, seem unlikely to be rewritten or replaced for DWrite/WPF. But perhaps
    Web browsers and readers are where we will see this stuff implemented first, since
    something like IE is a much smaller code base than e.g. Word and without the same
    backwards compatibility issues.

    love to take the Verdana & Georgia strategy across other fonts, and work with
    the designers to let them expand the families to meet the needs of graphic designers.
    If and when that happens I'll be sure to report back."
