  &#40;the handwriting font&#41;Or maybe one that is very similar? Where can I find
  it?  <BR> <BR>Thank you. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69504.jpg"

  body: It&#39;s hand printed. You can tell from the identical letters that don&#39;t
    look exactly the same. <BR> <BR>However, there are many fonts that might be similar
    enough, depending on what you want. See <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Part 11 of the Script Font ID Guide</a> for some ideas. There&#39;s
    nothing downloadable there, but some of the fonts are freeware, and the sources
    are all identified in the Reference List that goes with the Guide.
