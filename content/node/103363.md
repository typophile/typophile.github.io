  has some large holes, forgive me if the question is very obvious. Was wondering
  if anyone tell me why these numbers are different? Am I right in thinking that the
  glyphs in the 1st are typical neo-grotesque while the 2nd glyphs are based around
  more geometric forms?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Numbers2_6734.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Numbers_5363.jpg]\r\n\r\nIs
  it ever appropriate to match the numbers within the 2nd image with neo-grotesque
  letters? See sample below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/handgloves_6173.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  advice is appreciated,\r\n\r\nSeb"

    \"1\" and \"3\") is sound. What I think clashes between the second set and the
    lc letters is that \"3\" might be too old-fashioned to fit with that \"a\". But
    we need more to go by. And when it comes to \"appropriate\": everything is, sometimes.
    :-)  So the best answer to any question kicks in: it depends.  ;-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    some more to go by..\r\n\r\nA little back story -\r\n\r\nThis project links back
    to a previous post of mine, on revivals. What you're looking at is a project that
    started a few months ago as a loose revival of Haas Unica, but has since morphed
    into another neo-grot. I'm trying to reconcile the purity of a neo-grotesque against
    the present context, in a non-gimicky way, something that Atlas Grotesk in particular
    does beautifully.\r\n\r\nSo I am, for all intents and purposes, the designer.
    And my view on this particular issue was that I've always admired the angular
    aesthetic of the more geometric numbers, so would love to find a way to incorporate
    them into the font, without sacrificing the neo-grotesque spirit. \r\n\r\nBut
    I'm beginning to think that using the geometric is too anachronistic. But at the
    same time, it's hard to judge, since I am looking specifically at them, and know
    them so well, so I'll always see the difference! I'm finding objectively judging
    your work in type-design is impossible (its impossible in everything too!) :D\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think?\r\n\r\nAt this point I'm still ironing out glyphs & metrics in a
    book weight (its not kerned or hinted). I'm still a small fry in the big pond,
    so I'm slowly feeling my way through the project.."

    (a, b, c, z) originally used the roman numerals (I, II, III, V, etc...).\r\nThe
    numbers that we use today (0, 1, 2, 3...9) comes from the Hindu-Arabic cultures,
    so you have a little more freedom when choosing the style of constructions (skeleton)
    you want to use, as long as they match the general spirit/style/voice of your
    font.\r\n\r\n"

    genre is a very narrow, very understated revival of a 19th century genre. Understatement
    is the whole point, but the non-traditional forms of 1 and 3 refute that, by increasing
    angularity and complexity. A revival that departs signi\uFB01cantly from the model
    is a lost soul, unless it moves suf\uFB01ciently far to become something else.\r\n\r\nIf
    your neo-grotesque were to include a binocular /g, an /l with a tail, and a straight-legged
    /R, then by all means. "
