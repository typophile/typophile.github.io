  to business...\r\n\r\nI've been reading The Elements of Typographic Style. Great
  Book. I love how the text flows and sits on the page. \r\n\r\nSo I'd love to know
  the H&J settings that would have been used for the book. I've been experimenting
  and trying to match the H&J settings, formatting etc. But I can't quite get it.
  \r\n\r\nAnybody have H&J suggestions? etc\r\n\r\nthxs\r\n"
