		<div class="commentbody">I have always used Adobe software (notably Illustrator since version 1.1), probably much in the same way that I have always been a Mac user. You stick with what is comfortable, fits your workstyle, makes functional sense, and continually allows you to do your work in an efficient and creative manner. I'm not going to go into why Illustrator is better or why Freehand is not - suffice it to say that the tools and interface of Illustrator simply work for me better than Freehand ever has. I have never been comfortable using Macromedia products probably because my workflow has become attuned much more closely with the Adobe interface aesthetic (and quirkiness in its own right). <BR> <BR>And yes, I use Fontographer (since version 2.x, back in 1988 as a matter of fact). This is due to no other reasons than force of habit and lack of time to properly acquaint myself with FontLab. FontLab is clearly the superior (and supported) tool - but the adjustment in order to migrate is daunting.</div>

I chose Illustrator because it was the predominant program in most the studios I was freelancing at and from my experience still is. <BR> <BR>I fell into using Fontographer because I had access to a copy whilst working at a studio in London and haven't had the chance to explore Fontlab although it sounds like it might be a better option. <BR> <BR>For page layout our studio has made the decision to drop Quark (way too expensive now) and go for InDesign so Adobe is proving to be a winner for us.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">(Hi Keith.) <BR> <BR>For one, the pallettes all tuck nicely into the side of your monitor. For two, they've adopted something which Quark uses (that I'll admit to missing), that floating palette (which can dock). For three, a cropped preview working mode. For four &hellip; I'll go back to work and come up with some that are typography related.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Keith: For me, the best feature was the addition of spot ink mixing. This was the only feature that Quark had over ID. And the ability to create mixed ink groups makes the ID implementation that much better.  <BR> <BR>Actually, the palette re-design is welcome too!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Back when I used to work for the <a href="http://www.kinkos.com" target="_blank"> &quot;McDonalds® of graphic design&quot;</a> I used Freehand. Illustrator was available to us, but boy was it confusing to me with it's many different selection tools. I bought FH for home use as Macromedia had one of their early sweet suite deals that included Fontographer (and some other products that eventually dissapeared ~ Xres anyone?). Also, back then in my PC-centric days there had been no recent upgrade to Illustrator in many a moon. <BR> <BR>Since then I've figured out Illustrator and eventually switched. it's nice to check out FH once in a while though ~ it has some nice things like multiple pages. But I do recall it had it's own confusing palette problems back in the day that could be sort of &quot;unpalettable&quot; to the newbie. <BR> <BR>Remember when three upgrades of FH came out in the course of about a year as it switched &quot;owners&quot; from Aldus to Altsys to Macromedia?  <BR> <BR>I'd love to switch to FontLab but $$$ seems to be an issue these days as I attempt to pay bills during my adventures in unemploymentland. I'm also looking forward to speedier Adobe products but I think I need a roof over my head more than I need new software. <BR> <BR>Hmmm&hellip; maybe I could be the graphic designer who lives under the bridge. I can hear it now, &quot;He does great work with the latest software as long as you bring some gas to help power the generator.&quot;</div>
