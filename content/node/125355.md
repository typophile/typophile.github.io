  be identified based on the \"n\" letter only. I've run several font recognition
  tools but none matched the letter. (the closest match is <a href=\"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/r-type/azo-sans/regular/glyphs.html#index\">Azo
  Sans</a>).\r\n\r\nThank you for your help and have a nice day.\r\n\r\nps: pardon
  my English, I am a French speaker"
