body: "Hello! As this is my first post, a lack of clarity from me is probably inevitable,
  but I'll try my best.\r\n\r\nMy problem is the font licence for a free Japanese
  mincho typeface, found here, in English:\r\n[[http://ossipedia.ipa.go.jp/ipafont/index.html#LicenseEng]]\r\n\r\nWhether
  this forum is the right place to go for help with this I don't know, but I thought
  I'd ask. I've read it through, and my tired brain ends up muddled. It seems to say
  in article 3, paragraph 7 that,\r\n\r\n\"The Recipient may create, use, reproduce
  and/or Redistribute a Derived Program under the terms stated above for the Licensed
  Program: provided, that the Recipient shall follow the provisions set forth in Article
  3 Paragraph 1 when Redistributing the Derived Program.\"\r\n\r\nThis seems clear
  enough, but I was wondering if anyone with more knowledge of such things could clarify.
  What I need is a mincho typeface I can use as a skeleton to create my own, free,
  fairly good quality Japanese mincho typeface, with less contrast and a bit softer.
  So I need to be able to copy my character style over the shape that's already there.\r\n\r\nI
  have attached two images of my own character for 'rain', as well as one of IPA's.
  Mine is the more rounded of the two, and ended up looking like a mix between [[http://www.fontworks.co.jp/typography/family/tsukushimin]]
  and [[http://www.typebank.co.jp/english/fonts/y-mincho/]] .\r\n\r\nIPA Mincho seems
  to me to be one of the best put-together of the (very) few free Mincho typefaces,
  and I would very much like to be able to use it as a base. If not, I'll search around
  for another.\r\n\r\nI'm lucky enough to have just enough time and help on my hands
  to get around the 'thousands of characters' thing, but without some kind of pre-defined
  structure I'll get lost.\r\n\r\nThanks & \u3042\u308A\u304C\u3068\u3046."

    move the thread to General Discussions.

  body: "Thanks very much.\r\n\r\nI've decided on using Hanazono mincho instead, though
    I'll have to do everything that isn't kanji (Latin alphabet, punctuation, kana([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana]]),
    &c.) from scratch. Though all the curves are made up from lots of little straight
    lines (this makes little difference, the end result is still smooth), the licence
    is even more lenient:\r\n\r\n'This font is a free software.\r\nUnlimited permission
    is granted to use, copy, and distribute it, with\r\nor without modification, either
    commercially and noncommercially.\r\nTHIS FONT IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY.\r\nLicense
    of this document is same as the font.'\r\n\r\nThere's also a free sans font called
    M+ that has basically the same licence, so I might use that as a base for the
    kana and punctuation."
