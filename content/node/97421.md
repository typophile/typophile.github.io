  fontlab (two words become one sign)?\r\nAnd how would be the code?\r\n\r\nThanks

    advertise your business \r\n<a href=\"http://www.ideal-sign.com/products.html\">display
    light boxes</a> mail outs and newspaper advertising may give you limited success
    \r\n<a href=\"http://www.ideal-sign.com/category/led-neon-sign.html\">neon signage</a>
    Not to mention time consuming \r\n<a href=\"http://www.ideal-sign.com/category/led-neon-sign.html\">neon
    signs for sale</a> It makes good business sense to have some advertising that
    continually brings in new customers with little extra work on your part. It can
    be done with led light boxes on the outside of your business."

  body: "Since the space characters are just like any other characters you can substitute
    WORD + SPACE + WORD with NEWWORD like you would replace f + i with f_i. \r\nBut
    keep in mind, that such ligatures won't work across line breaks. So the typical
    solution would be, not to address the space character(s) itself, but rather to
    check for \"is-not-a-regular-letter\" as defined in you glyph classes. "
