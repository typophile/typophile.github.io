  body: "I appreciate your comment about the website. The Font ID Guides are a collaborative
    effort with many people who have helped to fill them with samples, including a
    number of Typophile members, such as Paul Hunt, Mike F., Ignacio, Mark Simonson,
    and 'gargoyle' to mention a few. I've been fortunate to have so much help over
    the years since I started them,\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
