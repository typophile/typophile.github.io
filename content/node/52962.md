  body: "Try the <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/perfect-dos-vga-437.font\">Perfect
    DOS VGA 437</a> font.\r\n\r\nIt's actually a more faithful rendition of the VGA/MCGA
    hardware text-mode font used in the original Windows BSODs than the virtualized
    replica that you posted. But the two are similar enough that most people probably
    wouldn't notice the difference."

  body: "the font used for these screens is a bitmap font, since it needs to function
    before the font rasterizer is loaded, or even if the rasterizer has crashed. \r\nSo
    you won't be able to produce it exactly unless you disable all anti-aliasing."
