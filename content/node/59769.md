  body: I've posted his sign paintings before, and knows that he uses Gotham Medium
    for a lot of his type, so I assumed this might be based off a font as well..

  body: "i use gotham medium, but I shorten the e's and tighten up the r's and the
    p's so it looks more like the speedball gothic that sign painters have used for
    decades, and gotham is certainly based on. The script is mine, cobbled from many
    sign painting scripts, help yourself\r\n\r\n\r\n"
