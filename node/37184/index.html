  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>For a while now, I&rsquo;ve been using David Manthey&rsquo;s free version of Caslon (called [[http://www.orbitals.com/self/ligature/ligature.htm|Wyld]]) as a general-purpose font for all of my word-processing (e.g. letters, essays etc.). Unfortunately, the number of characters which it includes is probably a bit too few to be practical (especially as there are no lining numerals) and it doesn&rsquo;t work particularly well in LaTeX (which I use for most of my word-processing).</p>
<p>I therefore think it might be time for me to buy a professional typeface to replace it and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions of something that might be suitable? I quite like the Caslon and Baskeville families and was thinking along those lines but I am a bit bewildered by the range of options. My main constraint is the price&ndash; I don&rsquo;t think I could really justify spending $100 on Bitstream&rsquo;s Baskerville, just for personal use! I was hoping to get away with spending around $50 (or, preferably a bit less). My main requirements are simply that it looks nice and that it can be made to work with LaTeX (that should be no problem, I would hope). I also quite like using the &ldquo;ct&rdquo; ligature, but I can probably live without that, if necessary!</p>
<p>Apologies if I&rsquo;ve said anything that sounds particularly silly; although I&rsquo;m interested in typography, my knowledge is not great!</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Jacob</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you like Baskerville, Storm&rsquo;s Baskerville 10 Pro is great and I believe can be had for less than $100 for the roman and italic if you don&rsquo;t need the Cyrillic (just a bit more with). You can buy it in Euros on his site&ndash;check exchange rates to see if that&rsquo;s a better deal than through Myfonts. Baskerville 10 is meant for text sizes. His regular Baskerville is a little finer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never used it, but Lars Bergquist&rsquo;s Baskerville 1757 also looks good and is only $79 (Fountain).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big Caslon fan, but Adobe Caslon is nice and you can get the roman and italic in Opentype for less than a hundred.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I second Gary on this one: If you like Caslon and Baskerville (Baroque typefaces), then Storm is your man. Also look at his Jannon, Regent, Antique, and Anselm Serif (if you want to try something amazing, but a little out there).</p>
<p>Again, short on time so I can&rsquo;t point out specifics, but Font Bureau has some fantastic offerings of this sort, and there you can buy separate weights of each typeface to save some cash.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the suggestions. I&rsquo;ll have a look around and work out what I think I can justify spending!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at the Essential Typefaces list a few times and it&rsquo;s always suprised me how different it is from what the main works that I&rsquo;ve read (Ambrose &amp; Harris' &ldquo;The Fundamentals of Typography&rdquo; and Tracy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Letters of Credit&rdquo;) seem to think is important. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s possible but it would also be  helpful if that page had a little sample of each of the faces. At the moment it takes quite a lot of clicking (and in the case of Verdigris, a Google search) to find out what they look like.</p>
<p>Anyway, many thanks. If anyone has any other suggestions, do let me know. I&rsquo;ll let you know what I decide!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To update you on my decision, after thinking about it for a while, I decided for a bit of a change of direction and went for Storm&rsquo;s Jannon. I don&rsquo;t think I would have considered it without your suggestions, so many thanks! I usually find that I don&rsquo;t particularly like Garamond but didn&rsquo;t seem to have that problem with Jannon, even though Storm states that Jannon&rsquo;s typefaces were once called &ldquo;Garamond&rdquo; on account of being indistinguishable from those of Garamond. I think it might be because the &ldquo;c&rdquo; and &ldquo;e&rdquo; have a little more weight to them, but I&rsquo;m probably not the right person to judge.</p>
<p>Now I just have to work out whether LaTex will play nicely with the OpenType files or whether I&rsquo;m stuck with converting them to something else…</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I&rsquo;m very glad that we were able to help. I&rsquo;ve recently been experiencing &ldquo;Garamond fatigue&rdquo; as well: I think it&rsquo;s because some versions (of both Garamond and Jannon) come close to caricature. Storm miraculously makes idiosyncratic types that feel natural, meant to be. I usually think about his Sebastian/Serapion and Farao when saying this, but that sensibility pervades all his work.</p>
<p>You could also e-mail Frantisek Storm himself if you need the type in a different format. In my minor dealings with him he was prompt and very helpful.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not alone in my thoughts about Garamond! I recently bought a book (on history and politics) by A.C. Grayling and although they put some thought into typography (there&rsquo;s a whole page on the history of the Garamond), I keep getting distracted by it, thinking how much better it would be set in something else.</p>
<p>After searching around, I found that XeTeX has finally been ported for Linux which makes using OpenType trivial (including most of the advanced features, such as historic ligatures and ornaments etc.). In fact, it seems to solve most of the most annoying problems with LaTeX– I only wish it had happened sooner!</p>
