  I tried to search for a topic talking about this, but I didn't found anything, at
  least what I was searching for.\r\n\r\nI'm now studing Graphic Design and actually
  I'm a PC and I'm a Mac (LOL). My main computer is a Pc and I've a Macbook Pro for
  working at university.\r\n\r\nI've some troubles finding some font manager for Windows,
  because I'm used to work with Font Explorer on Mac and I think it's one of the best
  choices for OS X, works fine, quick and have a lot of options.\r\n\r\nFor Windows,
  there's Suitcase wich lots of people say's the best one, but not for me, I think
  it sucks. Now I've tried Suitcase Fusion 2 and it seems the worst suitcase I've
  ever tested, It didn't oppened on Windows startup and I've to open the program each
  time I want to activate a font... so frustrating.\r\n\r\nI know Linotype is working
  on a Font Explorer version for Windows, but the beta version have some bugs and
  there's not any link to donwload it at now... so I need some font manager program
  wich works like Font Explorer but over Windows (actually I've Windows 7 ultimate
  on my PC), and I've tried some of them but I don't likked them...\r\n\r\nSo as I
  know here's the best place to put questions like that, please, suggest me one font
  manager to use with Windows.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\nRegards from Spain
  ^^"

    seem to have stopped the development of a Windows version. And it was announced
    as freeware. A Windows version was promised. Both was a bold lie (because Linotype
    wants to have money for the Mac version, which also was announced as freeware)!\r\n\r\nAnd
    I totally agree, that Suitcase sucks."

    if you want. The Core keeps all of your requested fonts active, even when Suitcase
    Fusion isn't open. \r\n\r\nTo enable the Core to startup at log-in:\r\n\r\n1.
    Open the Windows Control Panel.\r\n2. Double-click the Suitcase Fusion 2 Core
    item\r\n3. Enable the \"Start Suitcase Fusion 2 Core at Log-in\" option\r\n4.
    Close the dialog box.\r\n\r\nHope that helps you take full advantage of Suitcase
    Fusion 2.\r\n\r\nArno, if you haven't tried the most current version of Suitcase,
    it's been enhanced dramatically from the previous version. You can download a

  body: "Thanks for all your answers.\r\n\r\nI think Suitcase is actually the best
    choice for Windows since I tried LinoType beta version and it fucked all my system
    fonts... (maybe cause I'm actually on Windows 7).\r\n\r\nI've tried SuitCase Fusion
    2 (under Windows Xp) and yes, it has really been improved, but I think it's still
    far from the easily handling and type options from Font Explorer, but anyway,
    a good steep onto it.\r\n\r\nI'll try again Suitcase Fusion 2 over W7, and see
    what happends... but if it actually works, It'll probably be my choice at least
    for now, because the other font managers are extremely overloaded of previews,
    options and many things on the main screen and the smaller buttons are the activate/deactivate
    ones, wich is really anoying (hard to find them quickly) (Like Font Expert...
    it's so crazy to search for something with all that caos on it's main screen).\r\n\r\nI'll
    follow your typedna progress darreng! thanks for your invitation!"

    FontExpert 2009. Here is my reasoning suitcase fusion is a piece of garbage.\r\n\r\nI
    paid for the program and yes it works great for finding and organizing the fonts
    you can even see glyphs. So why does the program suck well it started randomly
    deleting fonts.\r\nAlso it tries to integrate itself with adobe products which
    often leads to an error and all the fonts you have activated through the suitcase
    fail. \r\n\r\nIf you want something that looks pretty but makes you want to blow
    your brains out go with suitcase.\r\n\r\nIf you want something that works go with
    maintype or my fav font expert 2009."

  body: "Arno,\r\n\r\nFont Reserve is the previous font manger that was replaced by
    Suitcase Fusion 2.\r\n\r\nFont Doctor is an application that comes with every
    purchase of Suitcase Fusion 2 and is helpful when diagnosing and fixing problematic
    fonts.\r\n\r\njfidesign,\r\n\r\nSorry that Suitcase Fusion 2 wasn't working as
    you expected. Perhaps some of your fonts were orphan fonts (missing either part
    of a PostScript font file) and that's why they were removed. Your fonts could
    also have been corrupted though movement across a network, or other hardware errors.
    Suitcase Fusion does not allow corrupt fonts into its database, to help you keep
    them from making output error and such in your workflow. You are able to add corrupt
    fonts temporarily if you absolutely need them, but otherwise, it's best to keep
    them out of daily usage. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, you may have inadvertently activated
    a font temporarily, instead of activating it permanently. Fonts that are activated
    temporarily are automatically deactivated when you log off of your system. They
    are not removed from your font vault, merely deactivated. \r\n\r\nHopefully this
    answers your questions about Suitcase Fusion 2.\r\n\r\nJim Kidwell\r\nExtensis\r\nhttp://blog.extensis.com"

    a font file explorer or do I have to build a library (a database) first? There
    is a font file explorer included in FontReserve and you can preview fonts, before
    you add them to a set. Is this basic function included in Suitcase Fusion 2? If
    not, Suitcase Fusion 2 would be a step backwards. A downgrade with regard to one
    of the basic functions. If I had to build a library, before I can preview fonts,
    Suitcase Fusion 2 would be useless for me. I like the font file explorer of FontReserve,
    because it is not just the Windows Explorer as in FontExpert for example. I don\u2019t
    use the Windows Explorer because of unintended drag and drop operations."

  body: "Arno,\r\n\r\nI think I understand what you are looking for. Yes, you must
    add a font to Suitcase Fusion to be able to preview the font. Remember, adding
    fonts to Suitcase Fusion does not automatically add them to the system's fonts
    folder. They are not active on the system until you activate them with Suitcase
    Fusion. All fonts added to Suitcase Fusion can be previewed and even examined
    at a glyph level with the Glyph Viewer before being activated.  \r\n\r\nFonts
    can be added to Suitcase Fusion in two ways: to the Font Vault, or add them in
    place on disk. Adding to the Font Vault makes a copy of your fonts into a secure
    location, while adding them in place merely refers to the file in its current
    location.\r\n\r\nSuitcase Fusion works like iTunes in this way. You wouldn't necessarily
    need to preview a song before adding it to iTunes. Mainly you just want it to
    know where all of your songs are located. You can of course then remove songs
    from playlists (sets) or the database (library) whenever you need.\r\n\r\nHope
    that this helps.\r\n\r\nJim\r\n\r\n\r\nJim Kidwell\r\nExtensis\r\nhttp://blog.extensis.com"

    come here to seek a better tool to use in Win 7 cos Serif is a bit unstable in
    64-bit, or I've not set it up right, but it is a very good manager. It is a companion

    it out.\r\nCheers,"
