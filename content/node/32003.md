    this looks like an old news face, more closely related to Century than other slabs,
    but all those I consider are missing a foot on the 'b'. That's the distinguishing
    characteristic that will help ID this thing.\r\n\r\nWhat is the source of this
    sample, Eric?"

    F</a> could be [[squooshed]] to match this sample. That would explain the awkwardly
    thin vertical strokes.\r\n\r\nSo Linda may not be as off as I thought. Egyptienne
    is definitely in the same humanist slab genre as 505."
