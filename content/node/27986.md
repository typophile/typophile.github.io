  body: "They can unencoded, so long as there is a way to access them through OTL
    features. Since you rely on applications to expose features to users, you should
    try to find appropriate features among the exist OTL features as documented here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/featuretags.htm\r\n\r\nOld
    style figures, of course, should be mapped in the 'onum' feature.\r\n\r\nFancy
    caps perhaps in the 'titl' feature?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you mean by 'monostroke
    lowercase', so can't make a guess as to what feature would be appropriate.\r\n\r\nIt
    is possible to define custom features in VOLT, but that won't do you much good
    unless you're also creating your own applications or plugins that will recognise
    these features.\r\n\r\nIf you think you have an idea for a feature that other
    font developers might find useful, I recommend writing it up, following the format
    of the published features, and submitting it to the OpenType discussion list for
    review and possible inclusion in future versions of the standard."

    body: "I've OT-mapped the text figures to 'onum'. they are unmapped in Unicode.\r\n\r\nI've
      also marked the the fancy caps to 'init'. Also unmapped in Unicode. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
      MS's recommmendation is  that 'init' is on by default in applications. While
      the fancy caps are designed to generally fit within the flow of a page, I think
      'titl' is a better choice, defaulting to off. Thank you. I will likely map the
      lowercase letters to uppercase counterparts in the same feature, so it will
      really look more like a titling face.\r\n\r\n\"Monostroke lowercase\" I should
      have referred to as monowith-stroke lowercase, like Courier. In !Disc Inferno's
      default style all but the line widths are consistent, except the final vertical
      stroke is 3x fatter. For the monostroke variant, this final line width is consistent
      with the others. I am planning to include this as 'ss01' for lack of a better
      place.\r\n\r\nAt this time I am far too naive in the world of typography to
      have an interest in extending the standards at all, especially when there is
      a serious shortage of applications taking advantage of what's already spec'ed
      out. Like 'rand'? \r\n\r\nThnaks for your feed back!\r\n\r\nChoz Cunningham\r\n!Exclamachine
