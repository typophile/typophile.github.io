  body: "not related to the topic of typography, but I need to mention this book here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cordeliafine.com/delusions_of_gender.html\r\n\r\nIt
    is amazing how much social surroundings can influence people what they think about
    themselves and the measurable outcome on skills! We as a society create most of
    the differences.\r\n\r\nIf one would read a single book on \u201Cgender differences\u201D,
    it could be this one. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/15/girls-boys-think-same-way\r\n"
