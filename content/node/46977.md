body: "Until yesterday, I hadn't taken an art class since the first semester of high
  school. Yesterday, I started a graphic design class.\r\n\r\nI had been worried that
  I'd know much less than everyone else because I'd never really studied \"art\",
  but it turns out none of the other students really know much about type and that
  I know a lot more, perhaps <em>because</em> I studied it all on my own with [[Typophile]]
  as my main guide.\r\n\r\nThe class should get more interesting though. Actually,
  it's already fun being reassured that I actually know something."
