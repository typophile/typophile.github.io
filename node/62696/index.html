<p>If money is the issue, I would assume your school has already licensed some fonts for their design program. Try to make use of those.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re out of luck if you&rsquo;re going to ask a community of type designers to give away their own work or the work of their peers for free.</p>
<p>If you really have a specific look in mind, maybe try designing some custom type?</p>

It is unfortunate we have come to a point were fellow designers are no longer lending that helping hand. I see type as something you use in school for free and when you are a working professional you pay for it. I doubt many people commenting your post are working professionals so I would not take what they say to heart.I do not recall you asking for any free fonts just if there where any free ones resembling Georotesque.</p>
<p>Keep on working.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The above are experienced designers. As experienced designers they gave you experienced opinions. Since you suffer from taste and a keen lack of perspective I will elaborate for your benefit.</p>
<p>They would have probably guided you towards a free typeface meriting similarities to your description had you patience; however, when you saw the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; path towards your goal you took it. Fortunately for you, many saw this error and pointed it out to you. Unfortunately, in your youthful arrogance you failed to see, identify, and comprehend the advice.</p>
<p>When I was in school our teachers advocated that we pay for types if we were to work with them. To not do so is unethical, shows a lack of integrity, and a disrespect for those whose work you would steal. You would risk arrest for stealing gum at the grocery store. Why do you think you should not be flunked and arrested for stealing the labors of three years? Did you learn nothing in school or from your parents? Great typographers only need one face. Rarely, does one need more than two weights or styles. Perhaps, you may need a bold, regular, or italic to set an entire book.</p>
<p>Why not take advantage of one of the typefaces you already have? The great Massimo Vignelli only needed five typefaces: Bodoni, Helvetica, Times Roman, Century, Futura. These typefaces likely already exist on your computer. A great graphic designer does not need a special face to express themselves. A great designer can work with limited means. If you are really in such a dire way than so much the better as your creativity will blossom forth vis a vis great designers express themselves through concepts. Stealing the work of a typographer to make up for a lack of ideas will prove to be failure. If not now, if you are lucky, then later in a law suit.</p>
<p>I am sure that you will need to learn the hard way. Most do. Most of us are not as great as Vignelli.</p>
<p>Mr. Danielcorr, I am sorry your parents never taught you the value of hard work.</p>
<p>Keep on working. That much is right. Keep working with your own hands is more to the point. Mattmc has a great point. Why not draw your own face for your poster? Then, you will have laid a challenge for yourself that is worth the pursuit. A pencil and paper is cheaply had. Your time is well spent at this. Another opportunity is to cut from magazines and make a collage. You can get black and white at the library photocopy machine for 5 cents a page, maybe 10 cents. Letters can be made bigger or smaller. You can get them from any book in the entire library. If that does not help you then hope is forever out of reach.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Caleb I agree that we &ldquo;the designers&rdquo; should be looking for the most creative source to create ones work, however this was never about creativity. It was about professionals helping students. The bit about my parents was just a sorry excuse for a joke or a stab at me I am assuming. I can sit here all day and rant about great type designers and what &ldquo;they did&rdquo; but this is no history class and we have all seen the Helvetica movie so we can save the knowledge for another blog. If you knew anything about typography you would understand that different typefaces express different feelings. I have worked with many &ldquo;famous&rdquo; typographers as a graphic designer and many of them are thrilled when students want to use there faces for projects. This will be my last post on this entry as I feel this conversation is not going anywhere.</p>
<p>p.s. I think many type designers whould be more offended with you comparing there work to a pack of gum.</p>

A SIMPLE REQUEST FOR HELP FINDING A TYPEFACE (whether it have copyrights or not) the ONLY thing i wanted was to do my work, and bring the vision i had for my poster CLASS ASSIGNMENT to what i sketched it out to be. is that offending? I understand where you are coming from, i would not want my work STOLEN, and im sure Danielcorr and every designer on this website would either, so how did i give you or any of the above &ldquo;ANGRY TYPOGRAPHERS&rdquo; that i had the EVIL INTENTION to steal it? understand that i am a hardworking student, and i scoured the internet before i bother you high profile designers with my childish problem. ill keep it in mind next time that i should keep my black-hearted intentions to myself.

<p>I have not seen enough work like this! Are you familiar with the Brothers Quay? If not, you would certainly enjoy their movies.</p>

Thanks. No, I didn&rsquo;t know of the Brothers Quay. Thanks for putting me on to them. Looks great.</p>
<p>Jason:
Maybe we should just take a breath. Sorry if I offended you so deeply.</p>
<p>We understand that you don&rsquo;t think students should have to pay for typefaces. Around here, that&rsquo;s a bit of a faux pas.  Not surprisingly many of the people here don&rsquo;t agree. Believe me, this ground has been covered before; heck it&rsquo;s been rototilled!</p>
<p>Shall we agree to disagree and move on?  Have you seen Sumner Stone&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/stonetypefoundry.html">site</a>? Maybe you can ask someone on your faculty to check out his incredible <a href="http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/educationalcompu.html">educational offer.</a></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>youre a bunch of uptight pricks i was just looking for some help as a student to an experienced designer, but if you wanna hate then hate.</em></p>
<p>No one said anything inflammatory. Everyone one typophile usually seems to want to genuinely help. I don&rsquo;t think your reactions are helping your case here.</p>
<p><em>“licensed fonts”???? i dont know what rich school you went to but but we dont even get free color prints</em></p>
<p>If your school hasn&rsquo;t purchased any fonts, I bet you&rsquo;ve still got a lot to work with bundled with your operating system and software.</p>
<p>The fact is fonts cost money. I still think taking the time to draw your own type might be the way to go. If you have any idea of what you want it to look like, just go for it.</p>
<p>Maybe if you email the designer of Geogrotesque and plead your case, you might get a free copy, who knows.</p>
