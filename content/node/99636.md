body: "So, I'm working on a project and have decided for conceptual reasons to use
  a 'dot' typeface (i.e. modular, letterforms made up of circles). The closest I have
  found to what I'm looking for is Perfin by Colophon (http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/perfin/regular),
  which works because of the generous spacing between the dots (required in this project
  as it is to be printed at small sizes onto fabric).\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone
  knew of any other dot-style typefaces similar to this, as I would like to try and
  find different options."
