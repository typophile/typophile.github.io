  body: "<blockquote>Thanks. In this case this title is set as an image, not as CSS.</blockquote>\r\nOf
    course, it's a graphic! Thanks for this very constructive feedback...\r\nLook,
    for the moment, I'm the only one that answered. I'm here to help (you in this
    case) but your answer makes me thinking you don't need it. Providing source helps,
    a lot, really... It could provide more samples (better quality, larger...), PDF,
    SWF... with earmarked letters that made the search possible."

  body: "Not sure if this is better but here is another image of the same font (I
    think):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dropdown_simul_habitOn_5385.gif]\r\nI
    don't have any other source except for the website:\r\nhttp://www.creditoagricola.pt/\r\nThere
    are some pdf's there but I opened several and they only included images and they
    didn't seem to be bigger.\r\nThanks for your assistance Ryuk. I am sorry if I
    did not sound helpful but I though you were suggesting inspecting the code for
    the website. Sorry. "

  body: My bad! Thanks bojev for being vigilant. I found the PDF stating it's [[http://vllg.com/Feliciano/Flama_Semicondensed|Flama
    Semi Condensed]] then saw answer of kthomps5 saying it was Centima and mixed the
    whole thing up... Really sorry for the mess... Now that's clear, I confirm it's
    Flama Semi Condensed.

  body: Sorry, Ryuk--Centima was the best match I could get from the small graphics
    you supplied.  Glad someone else searched out the PDFs and got a definitive answer
    for you.
