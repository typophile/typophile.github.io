		<div class="commentbody">Stephen, <BR> <BR>It is called Mofle. It means Muffler in Spanish. <BR>Thus, Mofle Loose, Mofle Expanded,  <BR>Mofle Dropped. <BR> <BR>It is inspired by the hand painted lettering on  <BR>the Muffler and Hub shops in the Barrios  <BR>around town. There are lots of low-riders  <BR>around. I drive a 66' Chevel myself. <BR> <BR>And yes, The difference between regular and  <BR>expanded is spacing. I should get rid of  <BR>regular maybe. The letters need space being  <BR>all caps any way. My thinking was the wide  <BR>family would make it  more marketable. That,  <BR>along with the shadow and extended  <BR>character set such as fractions I  <BR>am hoping will make it more appealing  <BR>compared to similar designs. <BR> <BR>The text by the way is a complete joke. <BR>Typeheads will know that right? <BR> <BR>-smc  <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>(BTW, I don't get why this thread has had <BR>virtually no participation. What to put in a specimen is a huge question.)</i> <BR> <BR>Forgive me Sean for restating what I said in my email to you. After having read this thread and all those leading up to it, my impression is that the Mofle specimen is about the right size for an unknown designer. How did I draw this conclusion? <BR> <BR>It seemed to me a trend from previous threads is that as a designer becomes more well known, they need to submit less. Duh. JFPorchez gave a good example of that trend: <BR> <BR><i>The first time I submited (as described) a typeface it was longtime ago, probably Angie, my first one to FF. In fact, I just send the a basic character set (suh panels done for Morisawa, it was in 1990). But this was before I start to design with computers. They don't have done any comments, I just decided how many weights, etc.  <BR> <BR>Then, i submited Anisette to FB circa 1995/96, there, they asked for hamburgefonstiv and some others trials if you have, such weights, etc.  <BR> <BR>Then, they reviewed it and ask for corrections, etc.  <BR> <BR>Now, its my own boss who decide if he accept my designs, generally he is quite cool with me and we have same feelings on letterforms.  <BR></i> <BR> <BR>As a designer nobody's ever heard of (outside of the hallowed halls of typophile) it seems I'd need a relatively complete character set  (uc, lc, numerals) and a sample of the face in action. How much more? My current thinking is if you've concieved additional weights, it might be enough to simply include Hamburgefontsiv in the additional weights (along with that complete set in one weight). Wouldn't that be enough to let a reviewer know a) the flavor or what you're doing and b) you do/don't have the skills to complete additional weights/italics. <BR> <BR>I would love to hear other people talk nitty gritty like Sean, JFP, and I have done in the course of these threads. It is all well and good for us to guess at what is required. Rich Roat, you drop in on a discussion from time to time. What are you looking for? Jonathan? Others who've had success? Less than success (me)? What did you do? <BR> <BR>After all didn't we get into designing type to get rich quick? Yeah, if my wife could hear me now. :-) <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Randy</div>
