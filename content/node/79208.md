  for the wordmark but is only available in a package and cannot be purchased separately.\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for alternatives, nothing too expensive.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: The term is "spurless (geometric) sans serif". Alternatives include Moderna,
    P22 Bayer Universal, Solomon and Karbon. Also have a look at some of the bauhaus-inspired
    fonts out there. Dessau is great though. I'd rather spend some extra and have
    a decent set of tools.
