    I'm not sure if it's identical."

  body: I was able to recreate this exactly using <a href='http://www.dafont.com/stonehenge.font?nb_ppp=50&text=Christus'
    target='_blank'>Stonehenge</a> by flipping the 's' (it's upside down), stretching,
    adding a white stroke with a miter setting that yields those spikes and adjusting
    kerning. Abusing it into ugly submission, that is.

  body: "<em>You</em> found it, gwh?\r\n\r\nFont is by Bay Animation. Makes sense.
    They offered to retailers bundles of ripoff fonts with lots of variants (oblique,
    bold, bold oblique, bold oblique extra extended hyper-spaced, etc.) of every font.
    I wonder which one they cloned  and mutated for Kelt Bold ..."
