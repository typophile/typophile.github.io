  Card\", a credit-card format card that'll give high school students discounts on
  the ticket price of musea, movie theaters, concerts et al.\r\n\r\nI'm not too sure
  of the type treatment quite yet, but I like the graphic mark.\r\n\r\nPlease tell
  me what you think, thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/culturecard.jpg]"

    their tempera paints into a sophisticated palette like that. You might try eliminating
    the eyes, and making the logo a smiling card. I would also use the aspect ratio
    of a credit card in the box behind. '

  body: '"I was so much older than, I''m younger than that now" Bob Dylan. High school
    students think of themselves as hip and more sophisicated than adults. A happy
    smiley face won''t cut it and I agree the colors aren''t "cool". The graphic is
    fine for a younger audience so don''t loose it just save it for the next job.
    I would gather ads that target your audience and see how they are marketing to
    them.   '

  body: "After thinking about this a little, I take back my initial opinion of the
    colors. I agree with Dan and g_u_y_t that they really don't work with your target
    audience. \r\n\r\nAfter a little more thinking, I really don't agree that the
    Dylan quote applies to your typical high-schooler. I went back to a younger time
    (a whopping 3 years ago), and really tried to analyze what high school was about
    to me and the people I attended it with. Most students are in the least bit interested
    in being sophisticated, they want to be the exact opposite of their parents. Most
    do have an interest in being \"hip,\" but high school \"hip\" is nothing sophisticated.
    Keep in mind, this is just my experience in a middle-class, Southern California
    city, so it may not be the same for other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nI agree
    with Dan, look at the advertising, and even the people you are trying to market
    to, and try to get a feel for their interests and style. \r\n\r\n"

  body: I agree. This is more Middle School than High School. It's very nice, but
    not quite hitting the target audience.

  body: 'I''m with Dan, the card is not sophisticated or hip enough for that age range.
    Your audience wants the accountrements of adulthood without the stuffy conservative
    feel. The card should probably feel like a funky credit card or exclusive pass.
    Look at the palettes of hip companies that thrive on that market: Apple, MTV,
    Reebok, etc. I recommend eliminating the cuteness and pushing towards funky edge.
    Only go cute if you can contrast it with another option as well. But if you do
    go cute, maybe think <a href="http://www.kidrobot.com">Kid Robot</a> cute.'
