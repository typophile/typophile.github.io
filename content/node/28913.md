  body: Whoops, Georg. You missed the first part of Gary's post. He wonders about

  body: "You could flip the \"W\" for the \"M\" to use it as such. The Munich Olympics
    '72 did so for the \"WM\" sign I think. \r\n\r\nAnd it gives the logo a brandnew
    meaning: Wc Donalds :-D"

  body: I have tried to do subvertorial stuff with the McDo logo and it's different
    enough from Helvetica to make it pretty hard to do.

  body: Custom, then? For a company that big and universal, there's almost no reason
