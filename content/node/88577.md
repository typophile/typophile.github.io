  having my agented book (http://shrapnel-memoir.com/) make the rounds and not find
  a publishing home, I've decided to bring this book, which I very much believe in,
  to press on my own. \r\n\r\nI've been told by many of my fellow writers that some
  of the most talented designers are to be found here, which is why I'm now knocking
  on your door. See, I'm seeking a designer to design/format my manuscript for both
  print publishing (via CreatSpace or Lightscribe) as well as eBook publishing (Mobi,
  ePub, iPad...). \r\n\r\nThe length is approximately 85,000 words, with no images
  in the manuscript itself. If you are interested, please shoot me an email with rate
  quotes and/or any questions you may have to at d.harrisgershon(at)gmail(dot)com\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much, Typophile. \r\n\r\n"

    in graphic design, no pun intended.\r\n\r\nAs to ebook formatting: basically,
    Kindle and iPAD let the reader do the designing, with very limited choices. IMSLTHO,

    doesn't like the text measure or margins? The display type? The text type?  If

    To me that kind of interprettion is a crucial misunderstanding. It\u2019s different

    can vary depending on the author's wishes. I've been involved with self-published
    book projects where the author asked me to set the entire book (this is for print,
    not an ebook) because he wanted professional help with things like proper punctuation
    (he had hyphens and dashes mixed up, for example), ellipses (he inadventently
    used several different styles), widows and orphans, smart quotes, proper use of
    italics, good line breaks and page breaks, etc. \r\n\r\nIt gave his book a more
