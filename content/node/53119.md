body: "I started school at Cornell University a few months ago. The first major difference
  that I discovered upon my arrival was the absurdly prevalent use of (invariably
  [[faux formatting|fake]]) [[small capitals|small caps]].\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the
  art, architecture, design, &c. events and materials never use small caps.\r\n\r\nI
  speculate that people think small caps look official, conservative and fancy and
  that these qualities concern the people at this school more than the general public.\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to investigate this furthur, but finding relevant materials is proving rather
  difficult. The topic is somewhat obscure, and the ambiguity of the term \"small
  cap\" doesn't help. There is a surprisingly large typography section in the library,
  but I found nothing on small caps in particular. The library does have many early
  editions of old printed works, so I may have access to early editions of early works
  to use small capitals in different ways.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any ideas of where
  I should look?"

    Printing Historical Society</em> (UK), which contains Margaret Smith's excellent
    essay \u2018The Pre-history of \u201CSmall Caps\u201D: from all caps to smaller
    capitals to small caps\u2019. This explains how small caps came into being as
    a class of type and how they were first used."
