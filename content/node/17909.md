body: "im looking for:\r\n- a typeface for the logo\r\n- a typeface for use in headlines
  and text (mostly letters, and business cards)\r\n\r\nit should be:\r\n- classy,
  but still down to earth\r\n- professional looking, but still with the freshness
  of youth\r\n- a work-horse, but still elegant\r\n\r\nthe client organizes events
  for middle and big businesses, and they are all around 25 years old. because of
  this, they want a identity that looks reliable, but still has the freshness of their
  age. that looks classy (because they will organize classy events) but should still
  look like they get their stuff done.\r\n\r\nany ideas? i thought of caecilia for
  the logo, i'd rather go with a sans serif or a slab serif than a normal serif for
  that task.\r\n\r\nTHANKS!"

    articles: <a href=\"http://typographi.com/001045.php\">Typographica's Favorite
    Fonts 2005, pt. 1</a> and <a href=\"http://typographi.com/000969.php\">Typographica's
    Favorite Fonts 2004</a>\r\n\r\nI'd look through honorable mentions as well as
    the favorites. You're bound to find some fresh faces that meet your criteria (wether
    serif, sans or slab) in those lists."

  body: "I hate to sound rude here, but aren't you asking people to do your work for
    you without paying them? Choosing a font for an identity is a huge job for which
    people can be paid up to 6 figures. I think you should keep doing your homework
    and try to come up with the proper fonts on your own. \r\n\r\nOr, work up a few
    ideas and post them here for feedback."

  body: pattyfab, that seems fair. i thought maybe someone would get an instant idea
    when reading the "guidelines", thats why i asked. i'll just do what i think is
    right and if im unsure about my choice, i will come back here.

      body: Stone Serif and Stone Sans are the epitome of corporate workhorses, both
        very adaptable and fresh. Also, Linotype Sabon Next and Josh Darden's Freight
        Text are well worth considering.
