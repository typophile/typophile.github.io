body: For a graphic design project I am in search of 1950s images (ads, drawings,
  etc) to use for some pieces. I have found one website so far that looks promising
  ([[http://plan59.com/|Plan 59]]), but was wondering if anyone else had any suggests
  of sites or books with good imagery? Since I am a student and it's for noncommercial
  work, I'd like it to be either free (I'll cite the sources in the work) or at affordable
  prices....
