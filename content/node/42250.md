  thought it might be Clarendon black but it is not and the fact that I am not at
  my computer means I can not look it up. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n"

  body: As this is a logo and judging from the line quality of the curves it probably
    was custom drawn.

  body: It may well have been custom drawn by someone in their advertising department
    years ago or a film type for that matter.  I doubt anyone was commissioned specifically
    to design it way back when.
