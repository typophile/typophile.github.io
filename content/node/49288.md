  body: Thanks for posting that here. I somehow missed seeing it on DO. It's definitely
    a bookmarkable site and I believe goes beyond just being appropriate for lawyers.
    That's the kind of information that should be taught in elementary school, but
    seems to be unknown to most college graduates.

    because many schools are still packed full of teachers who learned the rules for
    typing on typewriters. Elementary school teachers should be the real audience

  body: "Butterick suggests avoiding Windows system fonts on the theory that they're
    designed to look good on computer screens, not paper.  I don't think that advice
    applies to all Windows system fonts (e.g., Palatino, Georgia).  However, I would
    eliminate Georgia (and several other decent system fonts) for normal legal use
    because Georgia uses old style figures in the Windows system version.  Old style
    figures don't jive with text that includes lots of legal citations.  They just
    don't.  I don't care how trendy OSF may be in typography circles, or how pretty
    some OSF sets are.  OSF suck in legal usage.\r\n\r\nSo I don't agree with Butterick
    in every detail.  But I think that he's right 95% of the time, or more.  If lawyers
    slavishly followed his advice, legal briefs would look a lot better, and read
    a lot better.\r\n\r\nI wish he'd suggested some good fonts to use for legal writing,
    instead of just suggesting fonts to avoid."

  body: "<cite>I like his visual explanation of what happens when setting two spaces
    between sentences.</cite>\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm just old fashioned (though I've never
    had to seriously type on a typewriter just playing around when I was a kid) but
    I prefer two spaces after sentence final punctuation.  And, he cheats in his example.
    \ He uses three spaces which I definitely agree is too much.  It also has a nice
    disambiguating effect whenever you have a text that will have punctuation marks
    used as non-sentence enders.  This happens more often in Spanish because it will
    flank portions of sentences that as needed.  Often times in English is clear by
    the lack of capital letter post-punctuation, but it's still possible for it to
    happen and I'd think that in a legal context the clearer things are the better.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

          I'm aware of this fact. I try to understand Si Daniels' (Microsoft) underlying
          reason for his question. Maybe Si would choose Palatino Linotype over Book

    the average person is exposed to these days is the EULA contract and that, along
    with other more occasional documents like mortgage notes etc.. the overall impression

    idea that court decisions can be interesting reading and even deliberately humorous
    at times, would be greeted with disbelief, I think.\r\n\r\nThe typography plays
    into this and I'm glad to see it changing.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping some kind of HTML
    takes hold soon as well. Wouldn't it be great to just click on a citation and
    go right to it? (But this will be a long time comin', I'm  sure.)\r\n\r\nThe first
    example of the Utah Supreme Court's formatting says: \"Prepare to be bored.\"
    You really don't want to go past the title page. At least I don't.\r\nGlancing
    at it, I think a lot of people would automatically assume it's a an old document,
    too. I mean, what other reason could there be for the Selectric look?\r\n\r\nThe
    redesign is much friendlier and much more readable.\r\n\r\nNice going, Butterick.
