body: "Last evening we released <strong>Foral</strong> \u2013 Rui Abreu's modern slab
  serif. A project that started almost four years ago. It started as a rigid and geometric
  design, but during this long period it developed into a more organic and balanced
  typeface, as it moved away from the initial modularity. Foral maintains its geometric
  concept, but with harmonized proportions and polished forms\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/foral_spec_typoph_5900.png]\r\n\r\nForal
  Pro is a eight-weight typeface, ranging from Light to Extra Bold with matching italics.
  It come with Small Caps and a wide range of OpenType features, allowing extensive
  and versatile use.\r\n\r\nFor a closer look and  got to the [[http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/foral|Foral

  body: "This looks fairly good. Congratulations.\r\n\r\nYou might want to re-evaluate
    the weight of the vertical serifs against the horizontal ones in the uppercase
    light cut. Take a closer look at L-U-T-E.\r\n\r\nAnd the lowercase s seems (to
    me) being *slightly* too little in Regular and perhaps other styles. Maybe vertical
    scaling 101% helps.\r\n\r\nI wish you success!\r\nA. St."
