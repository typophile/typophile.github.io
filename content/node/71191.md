    a Vince Connare font (as is obvious from the identical \"t\"s), not the cartoonist
    in question's lettering.\r\nSo it is, if not a lie, sloppy journalism.\r\nBy making
    an exception to the style guide, and using the much-maligned CS, the article demeans
    the subject's status, skewing the objectivity that newspapers are supposed to
    provide. Again, bad journalism."

    on his own lettering. Wouldn't that have been a better choice than Comic Sans?
    \ So, this just seems like a WSJ art director being uncommonly lazy. As a newspaper,
    I'm glad the WSJ is making a go of it, but the typographic fit & finish has really
