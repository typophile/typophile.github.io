body: I&#39;ve searched for inline and/or solid versions of this font to no avail.  It
  may be a custom typeface, but before I give up, let&#39;s let everyone have a crack
  at it. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64433.jpg"

  body: I would agree that this is custom. I&#39;ll bet if you drew a quarter circle
    and a line it would be pretty close to drawing itself.
