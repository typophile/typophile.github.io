  created for Phaidon's publication of Area. It is called Typ 1441. Lineto sells Schweitzer's
  Typ 1451 (http://lineto.com/1.0/content_5.html) but it is too wide for my purposes
  (a design c.v.). I was wondering if anyone could recommend a close match?\r\n\r\nThanks
  much.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/specimen2_5882.jpg]"

    suggestions are decent substitutes based on overall form and proportions, but
    may miss on some of the details (DIN comes closest on both the numerals and the

  body: Thanks KThomps. I keep coming back to DIN for my project, and then avoiding
    it again b/c I'm worried that when the text is read by Germans it will conjure
    street signs. But I like the Parachute families. Thanks.

  body: "You could commission a custom font from Lineto, or another foundry. Or you
    could modify Typ 1451, but: it's not easy to do a clean job; you have to make
    sure the results don't leak out to the world.\r\n\r\nDIN does indeed have too
    much baggage.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
