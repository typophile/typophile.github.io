    is scooped out at the top and I didn't remember that detail.\r\n\r\nNow the Arabic."

  body: "Ah. I may not have made myself clear. That is not my work, but rather the
    cover of a book project by Jordi Colomer titled \"Arabian Stars\".\r\n\r\nHaving
    explained that, I'm working on a small project for a traveling exhibition titled
    \"Dafatir\". (Google if you want to see images from the show.) It features Iraqi
    contmporarybook art. Although we don't have the budget to set the full texts in
    Arabic, I wan't to possibly have the title set in Arabic.\r\n\r\nI was so impressed
    with the well matched script and how it works with the Gill that I wanted to see
    if anyone knew what font was used for the Arabic or if it was custom. I want to
    look at all the options available, and would also look at hiring someone to set
    \"Dafatir\" in Arabic script with a similar feel to the type I choose for the
    book.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me via my web page if you have interest."
