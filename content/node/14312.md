  font around. By lightning strike I mean very angular, electrocuted letters, mimicking
  the movement of a lightning. Think 70's disco music or 00's \"electro clash\" record
  sleeves...they use this style a lot, but I was unable to find something as of yet.\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much! BTW, this site rules.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day,\r\nGeleon"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nthank you fot the links! Pastor of Muppets is pretty cool and
    closest to what I was envisioning..but it really screams \"Metallica\" at you.
    Can't imagine it spelling anything else. Any more?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nGeleon"

  body: "pattyfab, thanks!\r\n\r\nAarco is good. And formlos, you are right, probably
    making a word look like a lightning strike is more of a illustrator's job than
    just typesetting..."

    from TypeCo and play with the skew of each letter.
