  body: "Good questions. \r\n\r\nDoes InDesign\u2019s Story > Optical Margin Alignment
    respect {opbd} if present? Or does it only work off an internal algorithm (presumably
    related to the optical kerning algorithm)?\r\n\r\nDo any of the common tools know
    how to compile {opbd} and related tables?\r\n\r\nI, for one, am a little unclear
    how you\u2019d write such a feature. I suppose the syntax depends upon the tool
    doing the compiling. \r\n\r\nThe related {lfbd} and {rtbd} seem a little more
    straightforward: for a target glyph you provide two GPOS values. Presumably, for
    {lfbd} the XPlacement and the XAdvance adjustments would be equal; and for {rtbd}
    the XPlacement adjustment would always be zero, with adjustment only to XAdvance
    (i.e., the right sidebearing). So, practically speaking, the compilation of these
    feature could probably be extrapolated from a single provided value in each case.
    \r\n\r\nBut do GPOS values get written into {opbd}, or is it just a coverage table
    that calls either {lfbd} or {rtbd}?"

    us with some specific UI challenges, so we're investigating further. Hopefully
    will be able to report back on our findings.\r\n\r\nSi\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'We considered this for both the ClearType Collection fonts and for Gabriola,
    but in both instances we ended up not pursuing it for a variety of reasons. The
    lack of any existing application support would mean that testing would be problematic
    (InDesign''s optical margin alignments does not use this feature; as I recall
    it is based on one of the Hz algorithms that Adobe bought from URW), and none
    of the existing GPOS development tools provided for multiple-line, left- and right-aligned
    proofing, which is what one would need in order to be able to make the necessary
    judgements. As Kent''s message indicates, the feature descriptions are somewhat
    confused with regard to {opbd}. My own feeling is that there is no reason for
    that feature to exist at all: what you need is the left and right GPOS features
    with single adjustments to width and positioning, and then application of these
    would be an app level layout function. There isn''t any need for the intermediary
    {opbd} feature, and I would favour dumping it from the spec and rewording the
    description for the {lfbd} and {rtbg} features to specify that a) applications
    are responsible for working with layout engines to determine left and right line
    termini and applying the appropriate GPOS feature, and b) that if appropriate
    apps should provide a unified UI for turning on and off both features together
    (this would be akin to InDesign bundling multiple ligature features under a single
    UI). In CSS, it would make sense to have a single high-level tag for optical margins,
    although lower-level OTL tag use would permit left- or right-only margin alignment.'

  body: "I agree that {opbd} could probably be dumped from the spec. Seems completely
    unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe UI could present a single toggle for turning \u201COptical
    Bounds\u201D on or off. Then it seems to me that it would be the responsibility
    of the app to coordinate with the text-align attribute assigned in order to determine
    whether to call {lfbd}, {rtbd}, or both."
