body: "Can someone tell me how to extract a font face from a font family? I have the
  Gill Sans font family but need Gill Sans bold as a separate font.\r\n\r\nIt's complicated
  to explain why, but I'm working on a big Flash project and the engineering team
  can only get one face for a font to work with our embedding process. I need both
  font faces as their own font to embed them both.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    an idea.

  body: "I usually just go ahead and use the version I have.\r\n\r\nUnlike my old
    international book jobs, when fonts were automatically with them, today I get
    InDesign, or (God forbid) Quark files, and they have no fonts with them. They
    are instructed not to send them anymore. As a type designer I say yeah, but as
    a book designer, I say bugger me with 6 ft pole. And I did. And happily my publisher
    was ready to pay for the font.\r\n\r\nThat means that language versions get their
    pay.\r\n\r\nSo, designers, hold on to your designs; change could be happening."
