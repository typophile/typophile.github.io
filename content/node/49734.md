  the typeface used for the [[http://www.marcecko.com/|Mark Ecko]] logo.\r\n\r\nI've
  tried using WhatTheFont and Identifont but have had no luck, which leads me to think
  that it is custom font. \r\n\r\nAny information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

    custom drawn for them.\r\nBut if you let us know what you specifically like about
    this logo, maybe we could suggest some alternatives for you.\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: "I think you might be right. I would still like to know who created it, if
    anybody did know, to see what other creations they have made. As this is more
    to find out about the typeface than to use it.\r\n\r\nI find the small quirky
    details interesting; like the bar on the A, the ear at the top of the C, and the
    middle bar on the E. How its smart but stand out from most serif faces with the
    quirks.\r\n\r\nThanks."
