body: "Hi typophiles!\r\n\r\nMy post is not about identifying a font but suggesting
  one. \r\nI am currently working on a document for a dance company to promote their
  new show. (Title: \"Tribute to the roots\". Dance style: Afro + Gwo Ka \u2013dance
  from Gadalupe\u2014)\r\nIn the choice of the display typeface, I would like to avoid
  stereotypes about african culture\u2026 but as I don't know african, black nor caribean
  culture so much, it's a lot of research to do for me at the moment\u2026 Does anyone
  have a suggestion about a typeface that would say \"African roots\"?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat
  comes first to my mind is (I'm affraid if it's stereotype):\r\n\u2022 a bold condensed
  Sans (Akzidenz Grotesk Bold Cond\u2026), a kind of wooden type for the press, \r\n\u2022
  \u2026or at least a geometric Sans,\r\n\u2022 a manual type (but it's hard to find
  the right one, not too childich nor precious),\r\n\u2022 \"Lithos\" from Adobe?
  \u2026but maybe too \"greek\"\u2026\r\n\u2022 a slab serif type\u2026 \r\n\r\nI
  will post later something I tried but for now if anyone had a suggestion, it would
  be welcome.\r\n\r\nClaire"

  body: "> a slab serif type\u2026 \r\nHey, why not trying a contemporary version
    of a \"display, headline\" slab, like Soho, Dispatch and such. An extreme weight
    of Dispatch (Extended Black) for example.\r\nIf classic \u2013 Some Rockwell look
    good also \u2026   \r\n\r\n> Neuland\r\nthis is the most stereotypical pseudo
    african font of all times. "

  body: "Sorry Poms if I offended you... but it happens to echo a lot of the symbology
    and decoration in crafts. Am working on a logo right now with a similar twist
    and the weights and angles are appropriate and complimentary according to the
    research the client has done. So before you launch an attack.........\r\n\r\nIf
    you go back and look at Johnny and Jeo's suggestions they are nothing more than
    variations on a theme.... with a little Hoffman thrown in. And what does a slab
    have to do with it?\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Graig\r\n\r\nExcellent x 3... I was ok until I hit the last line. Sometimes
    I think academes and critics overstep.\r\n\r\n What I was insinuating about Neuland
    is the hand work, almost a purely primitive response to the medium. The angles
    and craftsmanship are what makes it continental to me... stone, wood, iconic,
    even organic etc. I have always admired this face, it was unique, quirky and bubblelicious
    : ) Sorry, could not help myself. And I do not think it ever belonged in the garbage
    heap.\r\n\r\nWhen I was teaching at VCU I had a Nigerian student who had drawn
    his name on his notebook in a naive Neuland. I asked him why and he said it was
    very tribal looking. It reminded him of wood and stone and the crafts his mother
    made to sell.\r\n\r\nI am working on a series for an international group and their
    focus is Africa. It is odd... but of the hundreds of pictures that I see from
    the trips, many of the \"painted signs\" have a Neuland quality to them.\r\n\r\nMichael"
