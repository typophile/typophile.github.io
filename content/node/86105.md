  brochure of the Sydney Theatre Company\r\nhttp://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/2012\r\nI
  would love to know what is the font used for the text, and especially which one
  is used for titles and headings.\r\nMy connexion is very bad so I'm sorry but I
  cannot include an image. You can browse the brochure here : \r\nhttp://issuu.com/sydneytheatrecompany/docs/stc2012\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot !\r\n\r\n"

    Condensed</a> should get you close."

  body: "Thank you R. \r\nAkzidenz Grotesk Condensed is truly quite close, but it
    seems odd for this particular company to use a custom font. Don't ask me why,
    it's just not what they usually do. I really hope this is an available to purchase
    font because it is a real beauty."
