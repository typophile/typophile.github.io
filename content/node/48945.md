  if using a label for the phone number we'd typically use \"telephone\" to indicate
  the landline and \"mobile\" for the mobile number.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense in
  America or would you normlly use something else?"

  body: I think that would be fine. That's how I generally do it.  "Cell" is probably
    more common than "Mobile" over here, but I prefer "Mobile"

  body: "That should do just fine. While normally people refer to mobile phones here
    as cell phones, that would probably ring a bit informal on a business card, and
    \"mobile\" should be completely understood. \r\n\r\nBut maybe I'm just presuming
    that since I know or use a word, other people in the states do. "

  body: "I was recently told that people are tending to use the word 'Direct' to refer
    to their cellphone/mobile, as the distinction between calling a landline & a cellphone
    irrelevant in some ways.  Could be wrong, but that's what I was told to put on
    some business cards recently.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: I like the idea of using "mobile" over the term "cellphone". Hard to explain,
    but I just see it looking nicer on a business card. Cellphone almost has a touch
    of amateurism to it. Why, I do not know, but it just feels like it does.

  body: "Why put two numbers on the card at all? I don't know about you, but given
    the choice between calling someone's landline or their cell (mobile) I'd call
    their cell to save me from calling twice in case they weren't home.\r\n\r\nI'd
    list just the cell number under \"Tel.\" or \"Telephone\" or \"Phone\".\r\n\r\n
