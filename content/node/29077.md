  CS2 that requires me to create a single stroke that has many strokes in it. I have
  to create my own pattern brush which I am having trouble with getting corners to
  flow smoothly, I have tried a few thing... even checking how the existing line brushes
  are made?! I am about to give up. The affect that is similar to what I am trying
  to achieve is pictured below. Could someone let me know if I am going about it the
  wrong way? Cheers. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lines_3681.png]"

  body: "There's something about the brushes in Illustrator that never works in sharp
    corners. I've had the same problem trying to make a perfect dotted line & it works
    well as long as you use it in right corners, but it deforms the dots in sharp
    corners. I've tried a couple of things to make a brush as the one you want, but
    I can't get it to work properly. I posted this problem here as well & ended up
    using a dashed line with round corners to obtain a dotted line.\r\nSeems to me
    that the best thing you can do is to just copy the center stroke & make it as
    thick as the outlines of your drawing & then use the blend tool to fill the space
    up with additional strokes. If you do the math correctly, you can end up with
    equally wide strokes as gaps between the strokes."

  body: "As Ill Sans suggests, the best way to do this is with the blend tool.\r\n\u2022
    First, draw the paths and make them as thick as you need\r\n[one tip i found by
    accident is that regardless what measuring system you use for stroke or text \u2013\_or
    whatever \u2013\_you can force it to mm or inches just by typing it. So if you
    want a 10mm stroke just type \"10mm\" into the size field and Illustrator will
    make it 28.346 pt/10mm. This makes it easier to calculate stroke widths for blends
    etc.]\r\n\u2022\_To accurately copy the example you post, you are best to keep
    the circles complete at this stage and make the stright paths separate so that
    they can be layered. The complete circles also blend more consistently.\r\n\u2022
    Next, outline the paths\r\n\u2022 Change the stroke and fill colours to give you
    outlined \"donuts\" or curves\r\n\u2022\_Release the resulting compound paths\r\n\u2022
    Select one of the \"donuts\" you are left with and Blend (after you have adjusted
    Blend Options)\r\n\u2022 Expand the blend\r\n\u2022 Delete the parts of the circles
    you don't need \u2013\_in your example, you just delete one quarter of each circle\r\n\u2022\_To
    the same with the straight paths (you may need to flip the direction of one path
    to avoid a \"horizon\" effect)\r\n\u2022 Join up the lines if necessary.\r\n\r\nI
    have probbaly missed something crucial but I made this in about ten minutes using
    this method.\r\nSorry if I missed the point.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Blends_3511.jpg]"
