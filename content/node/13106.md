  French for a standards manual. But while we're at it maybe someone could post some
  more translations of English to French if they have a moment just for fun eh?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nP.S.
  sorry Stefan, haven't been here in a while, have no idea how the instant messenger

    and french versions of Porchez's site, but I'm sure that they will not be much
    of a surprise:\r\n\r\nroman = romain\r\nitalic = italique\r\ntitling = titrage\r\n\r\nI'd
    also be interested in learning the rest."

    I worked in Paris La Defense for a while.\r\n\r\nMaybe this link to <a href=\"http://www.perrousseaux.com/Perrousseaux.asp?Page=Lexique\">LEXIQUE
    TYPOGRAPHIQUE</a> might be helpful.\r\n\r\nAlso, these seems like a good jump
    points to other sites about typography in French:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typographie.org\">Typographie.org</a>\r\n<a
