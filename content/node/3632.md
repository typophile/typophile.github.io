  body: After I saw Amelie I went on a mad fonthunt for  <BR>that script. Along the
    way I ran into scores of <BR>great frenchie brush scripts like <A HREF="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205081"
    TARGET="_top">Chaplin</A>, <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=pepita"
    TARGET="_top">Pepita</A>, <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily103.html"
    TARGET="_top">Impuls</A>, <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily19465.html"
    TARGET="_top">Stentor</A>, <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily3635.html"
    TARGET="_top">Charme</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily150.html"
    TARGET="_top">Palette</A>,  <BR>but none of those are it. Could be a custom job.
    <BR> <BR>I kept seeing the names Imre Reiner, Helmut  <BR>Mattheis, and Martin
    Wilke associated with the <BR>style - so maybe searching for the work of those
    <BR>boys will help. <BR> <BR>Stephen

    Really? Imre Reiner&#39;s work is so close, but it&#39;s not it... '
