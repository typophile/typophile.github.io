    is very close, but I found six or seven others as well that were so similar that
    it would take side by side comparison to tell them apart (at least for these letters).
    If you have other letter samples it might help. The letter that was hardest to
    match was the R, but all the candidate fonts I found had the same basic, straight-leg
    style, just slightly different counter shapes.\r\n\r\nSome other close styles:
    Sentico Sans, Glober, Prelo, Metronic, Dobra, Vinkel and FF Plus Sans, all at
    MyFonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
