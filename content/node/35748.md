  website for the headlines and the company logo?\r\n\r\nI tried to put it into identifont
  but the closing thing it could come up with is Lucida Sans, which I guess looks
  like it except this font is much more narrow.\r\n\r\nThe logo font I have no idea
  because some of the letters connect with each other a little bit."

  body: I'd say the logo is custom designed, or at least customised from existing
    type. It shares some superficial similarities with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/optima_std_ot_virtual/">Optima</A>,
    but that's about it.
