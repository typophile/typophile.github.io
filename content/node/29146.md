body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI know this has probably been asked here before, a thousand
  times, but somehow the search option doesn't seem to work very well at the moment.\r\n\r\nI
  am a graphic design student, and currently I'm working on a magazine design.\r\nWhen
  thinking about it, I realised I dont have alot/enough experience with setting magazine
  articles, so I would like to know what typefaces (serif and sans, sans both for
  text and headlines) work well for magazines, or texts in general. \r\nOf course
  I know the regular faces like Caslon, Garamond, Stone Serif, etc., but I would like
  to get to know a couple of good new ones.  \r\n\r\nI would appreciate it alot if
  you people could post a couple of your favorites, and maybe a good sans serif to
  accompany it!\r\nI don't really mind about styles and other aspects yet, right now
  I'm just curious what faces work well for text that I don't know yet, basically
  just to learn more about text typography.\r\n\r\n(Excuse my horrible English, it's
  very late and not my native language).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: That book looks interesting. No, I didn't know it yet, so I will order it
    one of these days. 'The Typographers' Bible', nice.
