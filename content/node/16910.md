  the typeface and the designer. My problem is, that I have to choose from a selection
  of typefaces where I (A) find the the typeface boring, or (B) I don't find any background
  information.\r\n\r\nSome of the \"better\" typefaces from this list:\r\n\r\nFutura\r\nGill
  Sans\r\nUnivers\r\nMeta\r\n\r\nAvantgarde Gothic\r\nAmerican Typewriter\r\nCity\r\nChicken
  Plain\r\nOCR-A\r\nTrixie\r\n\r\nI would love to do a work about OCR-A (can be interesting
  in terms of graphics), but i can't find anything about it...\r\nWhich typefaces
  would you consider interesting to work on?   And in case you have any information
  about any of these typefaces (beside of links to websites), please let me know..\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance, Michi\r\n\r\n"

    Amazing font from an incredible designer.\r\nNot talking about Futura, I mean,
    Paul Renner and geometric fonts,\r\nmore histoy to dive in than ... whatever.
    Fascinating subject of study\r\n\r\nForget Avant Garde, too many posting on typophiles.\r\nI
    love City, maybe because slab serif drive me crazzy\r\n\r\nUniverse and Gill Sans...
    well great fonts and tons of info everywhere.\r\nCame on make a choice you like!
    theres great stuff in your list,\r\nand then start your research and you will
    be surprised how much info you find...\r\n\r\nlet us now your choice if other
    than OCR-A\r\n\r\nG."

      fonts from the upper list are the fonts where it should be easy to find much
      info.. but I would prefer to pick one from the lower.. the city would be my
      second choice..\r\nDon't worry, if I don't find anything about the fonts from
      the lower list, i will pick meta."

      my sheet, it's a font from david carson and betsy kopshina, made 1994.. but

  body: "Of all the typefaces you could have chosen on the list you showed us, ITC
    Avant Garde Gothic is currently the most controverial and misrepresented type
    design whose true origin is masked behind myth and \"marketing spin\". In other
    words, most of what you will find \"published\"  on AGG has been \"glamorized\"
    in order to continually remarket a typeface that was never meant to be a typeface.\r\n\r\nIf
    you search Typophile and Typographica (typographi.com) you will find conflicting
    viewpoints on both the expansion of the type family and even the viability of
    its usefulness. Unless you are willing to really dig behind all the bullsh*t,
    your project will just be dumped into a cesspool of criticism. \r\n\r\nBesides
    basic research, if you could interview some of Lubalin's contemporaries and get
    some yet undisclosed background on how the design really evolved from the magazine's
    cover to a full upper and lowercase type family released by ITC, then that would
    really be a story to tell.\r\n"

      said that the only good application of the font was at the logo itself..\r\n\r\nBesides
      that the typeface is unusable for copy text, it has also a very restricted use
      as display/headline face (i hope you know what I am trying to say with my bad

      I choose a font which is interesting to talk about (and what could be a better
      choice than a controversal typeface like this).\r\n\r\nI am interested why people
      still buy a typeface like this nowadays - and there have to be many people because
      otherwise the foundries wouldn't republish/update the typeface.\r\n\r\nWhere
      do you see the Avantgarde Gothic in use (except of works which deal with the
      late 60ies / early 70ies / spaceage, etc.)? Have you seen the typeface in contemporary
      publications?\r\nI would be interested in getting to know in which situations

    It is evocative, and they like nostalgia.\r\n2. They can't be bothered to work
    with new faces, finding it easier to slip into proven cliches.\r\n3. It's fun
    to play with the alternates.\r\n4. It's rewarding to take a classic for a spin
    - at least once.\r\n5. They bought the hype, and hope some of the Lubalin glamour
    will rub off. Let's face it, type designers (with the exception of one or two
    rock stars) are a dull bunch."
