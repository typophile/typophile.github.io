  he wakes up. Unfortunately, I only had about 3 hours to think about what I want
  to do and after numerous drawings I decided on this one. Their brand is, as stated,
  relaxed cool and fun like you're on vacation.\r\n\r\nThe brand is actually pronounced
  \"vibe\". That's why the curly-thing, whatever you call it, is in some of them.
  \r\n\r\nWhach'yall think?   "

    brand.

  body: "@epsilicon & Spire  - LOL, well, the tilde is actually on their current logo.
    \r\n\r\n@illustarellite  - The stuff I added are black&white just for print reasons.
    The final version, if chosen, will be colored to their liking."

  body: Interesting. Can you show their current logo, because all I'm hearing in my
    head is "vib", not "vibe".
