  body: I have been using FontLab 4.1 since a month, and its a pretty good alternative...
    <BR> <BR>allthough i haven&#39;t decifrate some stuff, there are a lot of tool,
    keyboard shortcuts and operations that are very usefull, besides the visualisation
    rules <BR> <BR>CG

  body: I made the jump from Fontographer after 6 years to Font Lab primarily for
    the Mac OSX compatibility. However, I have since found Font Lab to be a far more
    powerful program but one with a steep learning curve. If for no other reason,
    try out Font Lab for its OpenType support. <BR> <BR>With Macromedia continually
    referring to a Fontographer update as being &#34;on hold&#34; I felt I had to
    move on.  <BR> <BR>I believe Font Lab is still avaialbe to registered users of
    Fontographer for a significant discount &#40;it was in January when I got mine&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I am in the redraw/metrics stage of my first typeface with Font Lab,
    so I&#39;m still a newbie with it. Others might have more info.

    a PC, you should download <a href="http://www.asy.com/scrcf.htm" target="_blank">
    CrossFont from Acute Systems</a>. That should do the trick.'

  body: 'Eduard: <BR> <BR>The most basic steps for doing this in Fontographer are:
    <BR> <BR>1&#41; Open the PostScript file in Fontographer <BR>2&#41; Import the
    metrics from either the bitmap suitcase or the AFM file <BR>3&#41; Generate a
    Windows PostScript file <BR> <BR>There may be some changes needed to the font
    family and style information in order for multiple weights to appear under Windows
    as a unified family, but this will depend on the typefaces you are working with.
    <BR> <BR>That&#39;s about it, really...'
