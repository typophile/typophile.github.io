body: Is there a definitive source for brand book inspiration? Anything I can source
  is slightly 1990's... and not in a good way!!

  body: It kinda depends on the market of your client. For inspiration, I've always
    kept a crib folder on my desktop and dumped anything I see online that I find
    interesting. It's really easy to run through this folder and pull things just
    to get some quick ideas for directions a project could go. Starting from scratch
    is much more difficult. Magazines that target similar aspects of your client's
    business are a good place to start. Design Annuals are also good, I've always
    pulled a lot of good things from the Society of Publication Designers and Type
    Directors Club books.
