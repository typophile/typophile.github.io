  body: The sans, it&#39;s Myriad. <BR>The serif, seems like some Caslon.

    target="_blank"> Caslon 540</a>, albeit slightly squished. The ampersand  <BR>gave
    it away.

  body: The sans looks like Johnston Sans to me; the font for the Underground.  Similar
    to Gill but with a few tiny changes.  I thought Myriad had a different G and R.

    post links to samples to back  <BR>up your claims? <BR> <BR>The sans is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frutiger/55-roman/testdrive.html?s=THE%20GROUP&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> Frutiger</a> &#40;I just checked, which I  <BR><i>should</i>
    have done very, very late yesterday night&#41;.  <BR>Frugal Sans sounds like a
    Frutiger clone to me,  <BR>so Jill gets credited for IDing the sans.

  body: Hmm, if it&#39;s Frutiger, then it has been stretched slightly. Frutiger&#39;s
    O is more oval, this one is rounder. I had thought that it might have been a Multiple
    Master Myriad. But you&#39;re right about the G and R.

  body: Well observed Karen. It made me hesitate, but stretched  <BR>Frutiger it is.
    Just as Caslon 540 was squished... Why can&#39;t  <BR>some people use type as
    it was intended to look like?

  body: I agree that it looks like Frutiger expanded about 104%-105%, but the G is
    not quite right - the stress is slightly inclined in Frutiger but your sample
    is vertical &#40;more like a Gill Sans or Granby&#41; - that may be down to the
    quality of your file. Only the ampersand looks condensed in the Caslon 540 bit.

  body: The stress here looks inclined to me. Look at the &#34;flat parts&#34; on
    the top and bottom of the G. The top is slightly longer and ends more to the right
    than the bottom. I tested this in Photoshop. The G is consistent with Frutiger.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;I would post my test image, but I keep getting 500 errors. The <a

    MyFonts rasterization</a> has similar characteristics.&#41;

    couldn&#39;t find it anywhere except it my font binder I have in front of me.
    I don&#39;t know where I got the font or who designed it but it matches exactly
    to the sample posted. Sorry for confusing anyone.

    There&#39;s definitely very little Frutiger in there. Am I looking at the right
    Frugal?'

  body: That&#39;s not the one Karen. Jill&#39;s is probably the Digital Typeface
    Corporation &#40;DTC&#41; Frutiger knockoff. I believe that DTC is now defunct.
    <BR> <BR>DTC fonts were bundled with some app of mine from long ago. I thought
    I&#39;d cleared them off my HD, but I see that Frugal Sans was missed &#40;I have
    Bitstream&#39;s Frutiger clone Humanist 777 anyway&#41;. <BR><br>

    target="_blank"> a discussion</a> where it said it looked &#34;very similar&#34;

    target="_blank"> this PC-font</a> through  <BR>the Larabie Forums. If anyone cares
    to try it out...
