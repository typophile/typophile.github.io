body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nWith the recent developments in web typography: web fonts,
  latest browser upgrades, higher screen resolutions, mobile devices, iPhone, iPad,
  responsive Web Design, etc, what's the best practice when it comes to setting type
  on the web, is it better (in terms of usability, accessibility, readability) to
  set the font size in pixels or ems? What about the margins, padding and line-height?"

  body: "All methods are valid.\r\n\r\nThe argument against pixels in the past was
    that, as usual, Microsoft screwed things up and IE couldn't resize type set in
    PX. If that's still a concern, use anything but pixels. Most modern browsers now
    scale the entire page and can deal with pixel units just fine. \r\n\r\nIn terms
    of accessibility and usability, make sure you aren't using an insanely small default
    font size setting and aren't going nuts with the contrast (too much or too little).
    As for readability, stick with your design skills. Most of the same rules apply
    online as they do on paper. "
