  the web for days now, without success. maybe some of you have seen this font before.
  i found this font on a document and scanned it. because of possible copyright from
  the owner I had to split the logo writing and assign the letters to the related
  Arial letters.\r\n\r\nPossibly it is just a custom made company writing without
  any font-type behind.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://h7.abload.de/img/fontsugx.jpg\"
