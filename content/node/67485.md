  in this style. Particularly after something with a lot of contrast and possibly
  something that will work in italics as well.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2213417041_e8ede2bb52_6477.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sidebar_5089.gif]"

  body: The second sample is very near to Bauer Bodoni Black. This family is well
    designed and has italics. If you want to experiment with something slight different,
    try Stone Serif Bold or Nosta Black.

  body: "Hi Lou,\r\n\r\n#1 looks like <a href=\"http://e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/f/firenze%20.html\">ITC
    Firenze</a>, by [[Tom Carnase]]. Not really available at the moment, see <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/20844\">this
    older thread</a>.\r\n#2 is Pistilli Roman by [[John Pistilli]]. Also not available
    anymore, <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/2156\">see this thread</a>. There\u2019s
    a new version by [[Jason Walcott]], named <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000118#specimen\">Eloquent</a>.\r\n\r\nFor
    alternatives, see this <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/didone_extra_bold/\">FontList
    of Extra Bold Didones</a>. <a href=\"http://www.typejockeys.com/type/6_Ingeborg\">Ingeborg
    Fat</a> by [[Michael Hochleitner]] is a marvellous fresh option with accompanying
    italics; it has a few swash cap alternates and all the other bells and whistles
    you could wish for.\r\nF"
