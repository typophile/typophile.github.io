    typefaces like the one above? I mean, do people actually buy the &#34;technoish&#34;
    fonts? Just wondering... '

  body: ' Try opening up the majority of the freeware fonts in fontographer and you
    will find less than 75 characters, incomplete designs, variations in stroke, obvious
    low quality auto tracing used every where, extra useless points, multiple elements
    that should have been knocked out and were not, lack of good interpolation, inconsistant
    weights, Obliques were true italics would have been preferred, poor hinting, software
    kerning at best if any and wonder how these fonts would actually pass pre-press
    on any commercial job. I have worked in environments where these types of fonts
    were prohibited for use, because they end up costing loss of revenue as jobs get
    out-put on film with currupted elements. You generally get what you pay for. '
