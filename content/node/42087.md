  type designers that would design fonts specifically for us.  We would buy them outright,
  and use them to design our products with.   We have already done two custom fonts,
  but would like to do more. If you are interested email me at daveu@uppercaseliving.com.
  \ Also check out our website at www.uppercaseliving.com. Lets see if your font can
  outsell some of our customer favorites!\r\n\r\nDave"

    create fonts for my use, and, eventually, sell other versions for their commercial
    profit.'

    through a network of demonstrators in a manner similar to Tupperware. I'm not
    going to knock someone for finding a new niche for a product. I certainly would
    never have thought of selling it in this way.\r\n"

  body: I think David may have made a hit-and-run at this and possibly other design
    related communities with a similar message (note that there is an identical post
    in our own Design subforum). He is likely expecting a reply by email, and probably
    hasn't checked back here at all since initially posting.
