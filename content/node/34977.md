  'Currency' I mean the Circle with the arms at diagonals rather than the Euro. \r\n\r\nWhat
  I notice is that the newer the font the likelier it is that it will being some of
  the flavor of the font into the glyph. The older the font the likelier it is that
  the circle portion of the shape will be a perfect circle. This is true from serif
  to sans it seems and even into monospaced fonts.\r\n\r\nWhat about height? Should
  it rest on the baseline or float gently - or mid way?\r\n\r\nWhat uses are there
  for this glyph? Kent Lew suggested programmers use them sometimes... Can anybody
  elaborate?\r\n\r\nSome developers seem to be using this space for other stuff -
  even jokey stuff. And some people are using it for the Euro. Comments?\r\n\r\nHere
  are some samples - the 1st set is the round group. The second is the group with
  the fonts' style creeping in and third is the monospace examples.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cur_3851.gif]"

    you want to give it the personal touch. To be honest no-one will intentionally

    sure Linotype and other major foundries just used a generic symbol in their fonts
    as they did for other characters. i think the original AFDKO even had an option
    where upon building an OT font, symbols could be imported from a symbol font to
    fill in gaps where analphabetic characters were missing.

    \r\n\r\nAnd yes it's not exactly 'Zaph style' per se - in the sense that it bares
    traces of an individual. \r\n\r\nI suppose what I was getting was hat it seemed
    that with a certain generation of designers* I was seeing the circle approach
    be abandoned in favor of the letting the font style determine how the glyph looks.
    HZ seems to belong to the 1st group. DeGroot the next.\r\n\r\nAlso, it does seem
    like HZ must have been okay with this being in his font. No?\r\n\r\n* I don't

    You'll find them on virtually any manufactured product. The one I think of most
    readily is that really ugly CE logo. You know the one I'm talking about, right?
    I don't know whether or not that is often found in fonts though. I don't think
    I've seen it. I do know that the design is pretty much uniform on whatever it's
    placed. It seems any reasonable designer would make some change to it if permitted,
    at the very least space it tighter, but I guess that's not allowed.

    think there's been a general trend away from re-using generic glyphs. Type designers
