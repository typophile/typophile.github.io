  ever posted any of my typefaces. So here's Dagon Sans, which is far from finished.\r\n\r\nI
  thought it would be nice to make a modern sans serif with high contrast but concentrated
  near the stems so the general structure remains like a sans serif instead of a semi-sans
  hybrid.\r\n\r\nThe file attachment function is giving errors and I couldn't upload
  the main typeface here for some reason, so here's a link to it:\r\n\r\nhttp://i1231.photobucket.com/albums/ee503/msilvertant/Typefaces/DagonSanslcv10.jpg\r\n\r\nUppercase

  body: "Wow! This is beautiful! Make it into a complete family (with weights and
    such) amd you've got yourself a succesful typeface! I agree with hrant and riccardo
    that the second italic needs work, or just forget about it.\r\n\r\nRegular: \r\n-
    bowl of /a/ is too large\r\n- Bottom left of bowl of /b/ curves up too much.\r\n-
    /c/ and /e/ are leaning backward\r\n- terminals in /s/, especially the top one,
    curve inward too much. Make them slightly 'flatter'.\r\n- Bottom of /t/ curves
    up too much and is too wide.\r\n\r\nitalic:\r\nThe thin joints are too thin.\r\n\r\nKeep
    going!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "To all: could you tell me what you don't like about the \"Super Italic\"?
    I admit it needs some work but I like the concept myself. Obviously it wasn't
    meant to be used just like a regular italic. It's a bit more like a script written
    in marker.\r\n\r\nRiccardo: I made the |H| quite wide on purpose. Dagon is quite
    humanist in regard to letter widths. I suppose it could be a little bit more narrow,
    but then I should do the same to |M| and |N|, shouldn't I?\r\nWhat specifically
    needs work in the stem? The subtle weight build-up above the lower joint was done
    on purpose.\r\n\r\nJasper: I'm just working on the basic weight right now. When
    I'm done with that (the basic letters at least) I will start working on Extra
    Light and Black, provided the construction of the typeface allows such extreme
    weights.\r\n\r\na - I disagree about the bowl being too large (the typeface is
    supposed to be quite open) but I'm curious why you think so.\r\nb - Another humanist
    element, though I admit it might look more stable when I bring that joint down
    more.\r\nc/e - You're right! I will fix that.\r\ns - I think the top terminal
    could be a bit more subtle indeed. I didn't want the |s| to be too open though.
    I want a few subtle quirks in there.\r\nt - You're right. Thanks!\r\nitalic -
    Strange I didn't notice that; I optically fixed them in both the italic and \"super
    italic\" but apparently not enough in the italic."

  body: Ahh I just realized the problem with the thin joints in the italic. I remembered
    fixing them optically because I did. The pictures with the colored backgrounds
    are older versions. I believe version 6 while I'm at 10 now (the images with the
    white background are v10 and v11 will be uploaded in a moment). That was my mistake
    for not mentioning that. If you look at the picture with the lowercase letters
    you will see that the joints in Italic are equal in weight to the Regular.

  body: I agree with that, however I don't think the typeface feels forced. Apparently
    I'm the only one who seems to think so though. I would be interested to hear how
    you would approach this concept and improve the design; otherwise I suppose it's
    best to just get rid of it.

    as you say.\r\nAs for a\u2019s stem, maybe big white on red isn\u2019t the best
    way to judge it. In fact, looking at the linked pic (smaller black on white),
    it could work."

  body: I understand what both of you mean. If it's nothing more than an interesting
    concept I don't see a point in continuing the "super italic" except for personal
    reasons, but I don't have that kind of time to waste.

  body: "First make the 'normal' italic work. Than you could perhaps start thinking
    about the 'extra' italic.\r\n\r\nOn the 'normal' italic:\r\n\r\nThe curves in
    the shoulder and the joint of /m n u h/ are simply ugly. They look hastily drawn
    and overly quirky. That same area in is better in /a b d g p q/ but still not
    there. It has to look fluid to the eye, not forced. The harmonizer from RMX tools
    will help your curves look better.\r\n\r\nOn second thought, the thin joints in
    both the regular and the italic are too thin. Try adding 5-10 units and you will
    probably see a much more even colour + better legibilty.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper"

    wanted to give it a sense of a serif italic, but in hindsight I think the thin
    part is too long; the weight needs to be distributed more so the shape can be
    a firm bow like in the regular.\r\n\r\n> On second thought, the thin joints in

    probably see a much more even colour + better legibilty.\r\nYou don't seem to
    get the concept of this typeface. I'm giving it this extreme contrast in the joints
    on purpose. As riccardo says it creates a nice stencil-like effect. That's what
    it does at display size, and at body copy size it melts so much together that
    it just flows and reads well. Admittedly I'm not quite there yet with the italics,
    but that's the general concept, purpose and effect. Adding weight to the joints
    and I almost see no point in doing this typeface anymore."

  body: "Try it. 5-10 units won't make it a different typeface. It'll just make it
    feel a bit more stable. The thing with that stencil effect, is that it doesn't
    shine through in letters without joints, like o, making them stand out. You have
    to find a balance between the stencil effect and a coherent texture and even colour.
    It's your baby. Your choice. I'm just givin' you my opinion.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nJasper"
