body: "I'm working on a packaging in arabic and I'm having troubles with illustrator.
  The ingredients list is given to me pasted in a word document and properly written
  in arial. Once I copy it and paste it into illustrator the whole text changes. I
  guess it's because it switches it as if it was written from left to right instead
  of right to left. It obviously can't be fixed by flipping it horizontally or reflecting
  it.\r\n\r\nIf you've had this issue before or have any idea of how to solve it I'd
  be really grateful.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!!!\r\n"

  body: "Unless you have the ME (Middle East) version of Illustrator from WinSoft,
    setting Arabic text requires extra effort or software. If you have Illustrator
    CS4 or CS5, you can get a plug-in called ScribeDoor that will enable right-to-left
    languages: [[http://www.winsoft-international.com/en/store/scribedoor-for-illustrator.html]]\r\n\r\nYou
    can also use scripts to manipulate right-to-left text in Illustrator CS4 or CS5,
    which are free but require a little more understanding of the software: [[http://www.thomasphinney.com/2009/01/adobe-world-ready-composer/]]\r\n\r\nIf
    you have Illustrator CS3 or earlier, then it is not capable of setting right-to-left
    languages. You need to upgrade to a more recent version or else obtain Illustrator
    ME."

    still no luck. I'll try to ask my IT colleague and search adobe forums related
    to plug-in installation."

  body: My apologies - I should have said templates rather than scripts. On re-reading,
    I see that the scripts on Thomas's blog page are for InDesign, not for Illustrator.
    There is an Illustrator template, though. If you download that and paste your
    Arabic text into it; if I understand the blog post correctly, you can then cut
    and paste your Arabic text from the Illustrator template into your working file.

  body: Printing the original Word file to PDF, then opening that in Illustrator may
    work as well. Sometimes the Arabic text gets converted to outlines, sometimes
    not -- but it'll <em>look</em> the same.

    Arabic to Illustrator from Notepad, Wordpad or M$ Word. And now, you can type
    straightforward inside Illustrator (ME) using the new MAC fonts.\r\nNo additional
    software is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
