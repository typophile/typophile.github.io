  the entry for \"a\" for example (all typefaces used) and \"Pronouncing the letter
  A\" box. Are the headwords in Lucida Sans Unicode? :confused: (The IPA typeface
  is Charis SIL, I believe.) I've checked the document properties, but the typeface
  names are written 'non-explicitly'.\r\n\r\nWhich typefaces does this dictionary
  use?"

    the IPA typeface (which I know). \r\n\r\nThank you for Le Monde! The italics in
    the 'a' entry seemed awfully like (slanted) Lucida."
