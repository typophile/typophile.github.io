I'll soon be creating an italic for it, and am considering an upright script concept. Verona features square punctuation that is shared with a sans serif that I've also designed. <br>I'm thinking of designing the italic/script so that it could be shared between Verona and the sans. <br>In respect of the use of Verona, I hope it to fulfill the same role that the Apple Garamond has done for Apple. <br>I'm also thinking about adding more weights, but Apple's successfull use of one weight leads me to believe that as part of a corporate identity it would be stronger and more identifiable if there were only one.</div>

<div class=commentbody> Nice work Miles. I was expecting a much more funky design being familiar with your work of the 1990's. I like your new face a lot and would encourage you to design the script and perhaps even a semi serif. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody> Miles, very nice - although you should know that I have a weakness for narrow, rigid designs. <br> <br>It's hard to make significant suggestions to something of such high professional finish (noting for example the slight taper in the lc "v"'s thin arm), so I'll go into "super-picky" mode - which does however mean that my suggestions might hold [even] less water than usual. <br> <br>The lc Letterforms: <br>I like the strong square terminals. And the vertical proportions seem to be well matched to the narrowness. Maybe the descenders could be a bit shorter. The half-serifs seem to be completely flat, as opposed to the full-serifs, which have a slight concavity. Maybe go flat for all. Also, I think either the "a" and "u" foot serifs should be flat, or the "d"'s should turn up instead. The "a" is very classy. The "e" might benefit from a stronger top-right curve, and the strong terminal seems to be closing things up too much. The "g" is one of the best bicameral forms that I've ever seen - very elegant - maybe a bit too humanist here? The ear could be stronger. The dots on the "i" and "j" (and maybe even the period) are really too sharp, but I don't know what would work here - maybe rounding the corners a bit. I like strong tails, so the "j" is somewhat of a turn-off (although it contrasts nicely with the "y"). The "k" doesn't seem to fit just right: it's too busy at the base (you might consider giving it the staggered arm structure that the UC has), and the upper arm's flare on the left seems too humanist here. On the other hand, the "k" you have is a very classy form, which does go with the overall feeling - so if you keep it as is, you might want to make the UC "K" have similar armature (not that I think that type of consistency is critical). The "m" might not need to be so narrow. The "r" might benefit from a stronger beak, and maybe a longer righthand foot serif to go along. The "s" is amazing - like a beautiful boa. The "t" initially bothered me, but now I like it a lot. I think the "x"'s lower-left arm being pulled in like that is unbalancing it. The "y" is superb - my attempt at a "y" of that structure for Patria was a fiasco. The "z" is class. <br> <br>The UC letterforms: <br>Very solid, without being brutal. The "B" -always a challenge- is masterful. The "G" might benefit from a double-serif. The "J" was bothering me, but now it's fine. The "M" has a problem with being too frail and open. You probably want to control its width in this design, but I really think the middle part has to go lower. The "P" is classy, but a bit recessive. The "Q" -which I should probably reserve judgment on until I see it in text- is a sharp attempt (noting the modulation of the body at the bottom-right), and I guess you want to keep it above the baseline, but I'm not sure you can get away without bringing part of the tail inside. The "R" is killer. The "S" seems to be leaning rightward. The "T" is nice and narrow, but the "V" maybe too narrow. The "W" has a milder version of the "M"'s problem, and it also seems to be skewed left on the inside. <br> <br>The numerals really work, man. The "5" is amazing. Just the "4" is a bit too shy for me. The "fl" seems a bit tight, and I worry about its strong corner (top-right). The BP seems to be leaning rightward. The "@" is surprisingly nice. Have you thought of making the asterisk upside-down (to draw more attention)? <br> <br>The spacing is probably not finished, but it seems a hair to loose to me (especially in the rounds). And the blank space character relatively too narrow. Nice quote, btw. <br> <br>I think the single italics idea is really great, but I have to see a working upright one before I'm convinced of that aspect of it. The closest (viable) thing I've seen is Majoor's Seria, and assuming it actually works in context, it still has a slant (which actually varies, between about 1-2 degrees). A couple of *nearly* upright italics (~4 degrees) that do work are Gill's Joanna and Unger's Flora. G Noordzij might have made something, but I'd be surprised if it's non-calligraphic enough to work for text. <br> <br>Your point about the one weight is interesting. I think it might have great validity for large settings, but for subheads and such it might backfire. One place where multiple weights definitely help is when you're mixing different sizes together but want to maintain color (like in simulating smallcaps). <br> <br>Overall, great stuff - no surprise. I hope the client deserves the high craftsmanship. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Ole, I guess funky isn't what it used to be. <br>Plus, corporate clients are a bit different than young iconoclasts... :-) <br> <br>The semi-serif idea is great - and nobody has really made a good one yet. I'd love to see it applied in the italics (conventional italics -besides being too fluid- also have a paucity of serifs), but if Miles will be sharing it between the serif and the sans then that's probably a no-go. But you were probably talking about a semi-serif *Roman*, and I think that would make for a great "sister" design. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Not that Fellow Designer (FD) doesn't allude to an interesting -and vexing- point about type design in general, but I personally have to suspect some hidden motivation here. <br> <br>Dear FD, I would ask that you please: <br>1. Read the passage in Alexander Lawson's "Anatomy of a Typeface" where he points out that Optima -arguably Zapf's most notable contribution to type design- is similar to a design of Dwiggins from three decades prior (noting that Lawson enjoys the credibility advantages of not being anonymous). <br>2.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody> In Fellow Designer's defense: Melior was the first thing I thought of as soon as I saw this design. It really is too close. I don't normally like to chime in with negative criticism here, but seeing as FD has started I thought I should speak up. If you look at the "weak" letters - meaning the ones that attract the eye for the wrong reasons - like the M, W and Q, it looks to me like the designer has chosen to alter the Melior originals but made amateurish design choices. The lc is more consistent, but when you look at the similarities to Melior, particularly at the tell-tale junction of the thick and thin strokes of the y, and of the myriad similarities in the curves and bowl/counter shapes of the g then what else can you conclude? <br> <br>Melior is a widely used font, but I don't think it is so widely used as to result in it's letter shapes melting into the general unconsciousness of designers by osmosis in the way that a font like, say, Microgramma/Eurostyle has done. You can almost forgive people for perpetually coming out with "new" designs which look like that. <br> <br>Paying tribute to an earlier designer is one thing - and if you're going to, then surely you have to acknowledge it - but this seems to me like a blatant squeeze of Melior with insufficient alteration to differentiate it to be able to, in good conscience, call it something original. </div>

<div class=commentbody> I'm disappointed to see how this critique has gone. People are way too quick to judge the work of others as being 'similar'. <br> <br>Okay, it's fine to say, "This reminds me of Melior," but you cross the line by suggesting that Miles Newlyn took Melior and squeezed it or stole some points. Do you all actually believe that? This is cynicism eroding logic, it's jealousy preying on your common sense. If you people want to play detective and take a bite out of crime, Typophile is not the place. <br> <br>Surely, criticize what you don't like, point out similar faces, but we should NEVER make assumptions as to how a face was created. <br> <br>That's one of the worst things you can do in a forum like this. <br> <br>C'mon now people.

<div class=commentbody> I'd like to chime in with two comments. <br> <br>1. Hrant. I don't think anyone needs to show evidence of their own abilities in order to critique other peoples work. If that were the case where would all the literary and film critics go? I come here to check out people's work and draw my own conclusions every day, and I'm a piss-poor type designer. <br> <br>2. I don't know if 'Fellow Designer' had mischievous intent or not, but I certainly found interesting the similarities between the typefaces. I think it was worth saying, and possibly Miles can benefit from this issue being raised? btw, I certainly wouldn't think anything less of Miles if Verona is directly inspired by Melior (a typeface I'd cheerily ignored the potential of until now). <br> <br> <br>Also nice to the 'Mr Grumpy' persona of Hrant hasn't changed since the last time I was signed up to the typo-l 3/4 years ago. I'd say you're all soft and cuddly under that tough exterior :-) </div>

To paraphrase Jack Nicholson, "extend some f---ing courtesy."* <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br> <br>(parenthetical here to say, I'm trying to say this nicely) Miles Newlyn comes in for the first time and you are welcoming him to prove you wrong? <br> <br>I don't know what to say anymore... <br> <br>But while we disagree, please don't take this personal. That's not what it's about. Same thing with Mart, whom I met in person (along with Hrant) last week in LA. (Yes, a secret meeting of the So-Cal Typophiles.**) <br> <br>I just feel strongly that to suggest plaigarism or point theft, especially to someone of MN's caliber is harmful and completely inappropriate. Also, there's something called a Chilling Effect. If every time someone posts something, their post is followed with "This looks like the work of SOMEBODY ELSE" or "is this ORIGINAL" it makes people reluctant to post something, thus a Chilling Effect. <br> <br>It's fine to point out faces that are similar, but going beyond that takes Typophile in an unfortunate direction. <br> <br>just my opinion. <br> <br> <br>bj <br> <br> <br>* yes, another JN reference. <br>** not secret anymore. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Hrant obviously spent lots of time studying the work before he makes comments. He is critical, as he should be and clear in his explanations and suggestions. This is exactly the point of this forum. <br> <br>I contacted Miles Newlyn directly to get his work up on typophile a few weeks ago. He is one of my own favorite designers in the field. <br>For anyone not familiar with the work of Miles Newlyn, he has 2 typefaces distributed through Emigre, which is as far as I know the hardest distributor to get work accepted by in the industry, their fonts are all completely original designs, innovative, contemporary and of the highest standards, so I would say it is safe to say that Verona is completely original. I think it is important to consider the end user. It is a corporate client and I think there is a good chance they used to use something similar to Melior and just wanted something similar. Well that would make the challenge to design exactly that, a type face that is something similar and original at the same time. I doubt they would be satisfied with spending $1000's of dollars for a couple of tweaks here and there. <br> <br>I think it is valid to ask if a design is original or if it is a modified existing design. <br>I am still working on Unicratica (which I posted last month) there are signature elements from other sans faces in it but this is intentional, as the design as a whole is supposed to be a hybrid of my favorite sans faces, drawn from scratch. <br> <br>I would suggest that when a designer places a post it is stated when the design is a revival or a modification as to avoid the speculation of plagarism. </div>

<div class=commentbody> What a welcome Miles get on this forum. I feel ashamed. Why not ask Miles himself about his departure and arrival for his work in progress? <br>I for one adore his designs and would welcome his opinion on anything typerelated. I would love to see the sans serif version Miles. If you still feel encouraged that this hostility against your effort can change with your comments upon what is said in this thread, then do it. <br> <br>And, Hrant, you are of course entitled to your critique.

<div class=commentbody> While Melior was the first thing that entered my mind when I saw Verona as well, both Fellow Designer and Stephen Coles have made some pretty serious allegations. It may not be necessary for a food critic to know how to cook, but it is still the burden of one making charges like these to supply some evidence of proof of the charges, and "they look similar" isn't enough to meet the charges. If so, the designer of Apple Garamond may have some explaining to do as well. <br> <br>Fellow designer makes the allegation that Miles started with Melior and altered it -- a very serious charge. Stephen charges that Verona and Melior "have some exact points and curves" in common. Are you sure, Stephen? Were to somehow able to compare the two, point by point? If so, please show the evidence as you make the charge, and we will be able to see for ourselves. Otherwise, it is a baseless, and purely circumstantial on appearance, allegation. <br> <br>As an established professional designer, Miles deserves at very least the presumption of innocence on this one until proof can be supplied otherwise. With (so far) groundless charges like this hurled at him immediately upon his participation in the Typophile forums, it's no wonder he hasn't commented. I wouldn't blame him if he never returned. <br> <br>I'm with BJ. I'm disappointed and embarrassed with this critique. <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody> Um, maybe I'm missing something here, but... <br> <br>It doesn't matter how high profile Miles is. If you are advocating people walk on eggshells simply because it might embarrass the celeb type designer, then I suggest you reconsider. <br> <br>If Joe Shmoe posted that face, you would be happy enough to query the Melior connection. The same rules should apply to any poster. <br> <br>I don't see that it's a big deal. If it's derived from Melior it's just as valid to me. Emigre were happy enough to release Mrs Eaves after all. <br> <br>I'm also not sure that 'Fellow Designer' made any explicit accusation of nicking the Melior outlines. <br> <br>a bit of chilling out is in order. </div>

<div class=commentbody> It looks different enough to me. Notice that the x-height is different, the width is different, as are the structures subtly different in the lower case. In fact, while they are obviously visually similar, and Verona was most certainly derived from Melior (and other Zapf designs), on close examination this shows pretty clearly that points and curves are not, in fact, common to both. <br> <br>Melior was never one of my favorite fonts, and I don't care much for Verona in its style either, (good fonts, just not my cup of tea, that's all </div>

<div class=commentbody> Are we looking at the same font here? "It looks different enough to me..." To me it's as clear as day. If he didn't use the actual digital points and beziers, then what he's done is squeezed Melior digitally then perhaps traced by hand over printouts of the shapes and redigitized, altering the x-height and making the cosmetic changes that we can all see. The subtleties in Melior's terminals and serifs have been replaced wholesale with a straight-edged and smoother-curved aesthetic, which though artfully done, it has to be said that this is far easier to do than designing new and different curved terminals. And while the curves in the letterforms are not *exactly* the same as the squeezed original, there is no mistaking the DIRECT correlation. The g for instance is uncannily similar: Don't tell me it isn't! <br> <br>On the question of calling it plagiarism, I for one don't see much wrong in what he has done, save for my observations above that I thought the M W and Q are misfits. Certainly Melior is not one of Zapf's best pieces of work and is worth a revisit. But I think he should make the Melior connection clear and perhaps he just omitted to say that when posting. Established designer or not, this work is undoubtedly based on Melior and it does Hermann Zapf a discredit not to acknowledge Verona's origin. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Of course we're looking at the same font. When I said that it looks different enough to me, I meant that it looks different enough to disprove the accusations of lifted points and curves. I do agree, however, that it is too close to Melior to not give some attribution to it and Hermann Zapf. <br> <br>> But I think he should make the Melior connection clear and perhaps he just omitted to say that when posting. Established designer or not, this work is undoubtedly based on Melior and it does Hermann Zapf a discredit not to acknowledge Verona's origin. <br> <br>I agree with that statement completely, and as I said before, it is completely clear to me as well that Verona is derived from Melior, just as Mrs Eaves is derived from Baskerville and Adobe Garamond (as well as ITC Garamond, et al) is derived from several of Jannon's and Garamond's Romans. <br> <br> But I think you have illustrated with your first paragraph that the allegations of points and curves being lifted just aren't true. Were they *derived* from Melior? Looks to me as though they were, but as you seem to agree in your statement below, the points and curves are not identical. <br> <br>> And while the curves in the letterforms are not *exactly* the same as the squeezed original, there is no mistaking the DIRECT correlation. <br> <br> The charges made by the anonymous Fellow Designer and also by Stephen Coles of direct lifting of the font itself (changing only a few characters and condensing the rest), or lifting the points and curves, however, are serious ones, as they would indeed constitute plagiarism. I think those charges were made recklessly, especially as they seem to have been shown to be less than accurate. <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody> Hey fellas. Interesting discussion brewing here. <br>I'm not sure that it's helpful to Mr. Newlyn, but <br>it's certainly intriguing enough to stimulate <br>some impassioned posts. <br> <br>To be clear, in my first post I said that the <br>design "does seem to share some exact points <br>and curves with Melior." I stand by this <br>judgment. I thank marcox for making the effort <br>to show a direct comparison, because, for me, <br>it adds credibility to my theory. <br> <br>I certainly feel that everyone who posts work <br>here should be respected, regardless of their <br>reputation or experience. I believe I wouldn't <br>do Mr. Newlyn justice if I wasn't honest about <br>how I see his work. By posting Verona here <br>he's asking for feedback. I expressed my first <br>impression and concerns. <br> <br>That said, I think it's a successful design. It <br>would do any organization good. It's unique <br>and useable. If incorporated well I'm sure it <br>could lend to brand recognition and esteem. <br>The notion that it's derivative of Melior (in some <br>way) might not be a problem. If points were <br>copied there may be legal issues, but we need <br>to remember that this font isn't for retail sale. <br>Surely it wouldn't be the first time a company <br>customized an existing digital typeface for its <br>own use. <br> <br>Stephen <br> <br>Some questions: When does a "revival" become <br>ethically unsound? How different must it be? <br>Can we only reissue a design that wasn't <br>available digitally? Can we only revive type of a <br>certain age? How old must it be? 500 years? 100? <br>50? I'm sure these questions have been asked <br>and answered before. Anyone know of a good <br>reference? </div>

<div class=commentbody> Stephen: <br> <br>I agree with the vast majority of your last post, and I think it puts the discussion in the proper context. I'm not sure this is a particularly creative design, nor do I think that it is necessarily particulalry ethical, especially considering that it does derive so much from a font while that font's designer/estate still holds a copyright, and to date we still haven't seen any attribution. <br> <br>But I also think that if the two fonts were laid transparently one on top of the other, the points and curves would not match precisely. (Check the bowl of the lc "b" and the structure of uc "H".) Technicality? Absolutely. *Should* it be legal to do? I'm not sure, but probably not, even for non-retail work, as I suspect that the original designer (Hermann Zapf) will see no compensation for this extremely close use of his work. But in taking this approach, as far as I can tell, Mr. Newlyn hasn't done anything different than was done in the design of Adobe Garamond or the design of a custom version of any existing font for a magazine, television network, or any business. <br> <br>I still stand by my criticism that the original critiques made allegations that were careless and unsubstantiated. As the discussion has worn on, those critiques have become more refined, and that has been my intent in making my posts. I think that can only help Mr. Newlyn's work as well. <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody> Cheerfully adding another pint of petrol to the bonfire... <br> <br>For me, equally telling are the similarities in letterspacing in the comparison sample.

<div class=commentbody> Dear Anonyrat, <br>Not only am I more clever than you, but I'm also more honorable. But in this case I haven't had to apply either of those qualities to any measurable extent. I think you should start a separate Hrant-bashing thread instead of trying to sabotage fruitful critiques in this forum - that would focus all your personal attacks, and maybe *then* you could make a dent - these occasional jabs are like a chihuahua repeatedly running towards me and getting kicked back across the room. <br> <br>In any case, I've always had a lot of faith in Miles, and his latest post shows why. Not only is he a great type designer (what are *you* good at?), but he can defend himself just fine. On the other hand, maybe I'm wasting my breath, because you yourself aren't really here to talk about Verona, or Miles, or even type... <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> I must apologise to all contributors. <br>I'm only able to get to the web perhaps twice a week for the pleasure of surfing and forums like typophile. If I'd have been able to get back here sooner I'd have been able to stop a lot of people's time being wasted. I was under the impression that the sans/serif etc. forums were a discussion about the aesthetic merits typography, not the issues of originality. <br>I'll put a much clearer intro to my posting for Modena on in the sans forum soon. <br> <br>So here's the background: <br>Some years back I was asked to produce a logotype based on Melior. The job never went ahead and I decided to develop the few letters into a typeface. This was called Torino, and after finding that that name had been used for another typeface (a condensed serif, must have been at the back of my mind), I named it after another Italian city, Verona. In not nameing the typeface Melior____ or ___Melior I had obviously considered the design to some degree not Melior at this point, and that has been the discussion here. <br> <br>The design had been sitting on the hard drive for some years and I'd forgotten about it. When I was approached by the client for which Verona is now intended, I remembered the design, and to my eye it immediately fitted their requirements. Only minor though important changes were made to Torino in aligning some design features with the sans I was also developing for the same client. <br> <br>In posting Verona here, a far greater number of helpful suggestions have been made than I'd hoped for, and I'm certainly respectful of the focus that it has brought to the source of the design, Melior has some truly wonderful features and I've long been a fan of the super-elipse. I also looked at Century, Renault, Monanti and Marconi whilst drawing Verona. <br> <br>Those are the details that come to mind at present, I bet there's something important that I've missed. <br> <br>I'm certainly don't feel worthy of the kind of defense my name has received above, I'm a type designer that works very much as part of a design team, and in that sense I'm not the kind of self sustaining artist that many of my heroes are; Tankard, Licko, Barnbrook, Blockland(both)to name but a few. The thing is, it's a huge and very confident step to say "I'm a type designer, and I'll have my own studio and do my own thing, and I hope people will buy it." I did that in the early ninties, and the typeface's that came out were pretty abstract, not the sort of designs that I can make a living from. Having said that, those designs and designs of that ilk (Lee Schulz's work I'm in awe of) are my passion. <br>In what seems great number of years I've been modifying existing designs for clients simply because very few of them have an understanding of the time it takes to do a new design, and throughout this I've either arranged the proper licence myself, or have had to pester brand managers in countries that have much 'softer' attitudes to licensing to get the proper licence. <br>Type design is a relatively anonymous art at the best of times, and anyone involved in the creation of new expressions through the letterform deserves credit, those contributors that have raised Melior here are doing exactly that.I doubt we'll ever get to the wonderful copyright/credit model that photographers seem to have maintained. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello, <br>This thread is really interesting. <br>One point though that I'd like to correct: the food critic example is not a good choice. A food critic <i>should</i> know at the very least the basics of cooking, even if he hasn't been to cooking school as really serious food critics have. In order to comment what's on your plate, not just say how nice or not nice it is but comment it properly, you have to have an idea of how it was made. <br>Which doesn't mean that all food critics on the market know how to cook. But only some are good and those do know. <br>Sorry to change the (exciting) subject but the topic has been brought up, so... <br>Sophie (food writer and critic)</div>

<div class=commentbody> I introduced the analogous 'critics' argument and stuck to literary and film critics. I'm probably on dicey ground even with the literary example, but film critics are a damn fine analogy. <br> <br>sort of on topic - <br> <br>Jeremy Tankard's 'Disturbance' is derived from existing letterforms (which face escapes me at the moment). It doesn't matter a sod. The new face has shot off into another sphere. For me, if a typeface has it's own character, despite it precedents, then it qualifies as an 'original'. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Miles, welcome to the forray! You always know <br>you have a healthy thread when there's more than <br>3 anonymous individuals (4 here). (Part of the <br>reason we haven't disabled anonymous posting.) <br> <br>Perhaps at some point you could elaborate on <br>how these licensing arrangements work (as <br>far as the client being a global licensee of an <br>existing face and then what steps are <br>necessary to obtaining appropriate <br>permissions.) <br> <br>I'm impressed with your work here. It's a nice <br>refresh of an otherwise fairly tame face. My <br>reaction from seeing the thing at ultra huge <br>sizes is that the dots on the i and j seem <br>overly large. <br> <br>Hope to see more. </div>

<div class=commentbody> So I guess Verona and Miles are pretty much in the clear. The only thing some people might ask is: Should Zapf have been asked for permission (even though Melior is paid for)? To me the answer is a clear "no": that sort of thing can hurt type design more than it can help. <br> <br>BTW, I'm a huge fan of Schulz too: I think his work is a tantalizing glimpse into the future. <br> <br>BTBTW, if the italics will be shared, it might be nice to have a name for it. What about "Rimini"? It's a small Adriatic city with a unique sensuality about it. <br> <br>> the food critic example is not a good choice. <br> <br>Well, maybe no analogy can be prefect. I just have a weakness for culinary ones! :-) <br> <br>Let me rephrase it: A food critic doesn't need to be a master chef. But you know, even that's flawed: haute cuisine is like display typography - it doesn't cover sustenence: the world of text. So maybe I should say: A dietician (somebody who helps his cliencts to balance taste and nutrition) doesn't need to be a farmer. ? <br> <br>> we haven't disabled anonymous posting. <br> <br>As I've said before, I think anonymity does bring a unique flavor to the table. On the other hand, I also think it should be a privilege, not a right - as in something that can be taken away if abused (even though no preventive measure can be fool-proof). <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Hrant, <br> <br>I do understand you, for culinary analogies are tempting to say the least. But the one you used, thus rephrased, sounds quite allright to me. <br> <br>Believe me, I've worked along duly published (and quite proud) "food critics" who couldn't cook an egg, and you can imagine what havoc they caused in professional circles. I know a very famous one (in France, he even owns and edits a guidebook) who's medically deprived of the sense of taste. I'd say that's the extreme situation. Besides, I think you are right in your analogy between display typography and haute cuisine, I had never thought of it and I like it. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Admittedly, I need to read the entire thread, as opposed to simply skimming. That said, I think Verona is very nice. Articulated enough for text, but ballsy enough for display. {Melior is too soft around the edges anyway.) <br> <br>My apologies for not reading thoroughly, but will this be developed into a larger family? Nevermind, just double checked. In that case, Could the lighter weight be even sharper and more crisp? Meaning, light weights aren't logical for reading, but can be beautiful quite large?

<div class=commentbody> New 2 this site. I'm a graphic design student. LOL. Two people in class mentioned this site. I will never waste a large batch of my time making fonts. I must say that I don't know what all the commocean is about. It was my understanding that fonts are not allowed to be copyrighted so I don't understand a mention of copyrights expiring. I've heard of Zapf. His dingbats are on every Mac computer. So. Do you think Melior does not look like 100 other fonts. Who did HE copy. This is not an original font. We can trace/scan fonts from sites. What legally can they do. Everybody I know screen shots stuff from the typeviewers then does minor clean up. We are students. We are not getting paid for our work. When we get out in the real world we will probably do the same unless our employer has a lot of money sitting around. Well also there are a lot of font disks floating around campus. I don't know of a single student who buys fonts. So if Melior is copied then so what. Is Zapf going to turn over in his grave. These are letters of the alphabet and there is nothing original about them. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Manoti (M Anoti?), <br>You don't even know half of it! :-/ It's really much more messy and complicated than you seem to think - and I highly doubt that you'd want to hear all the gory details: the topsy-turviness and legalities of font protection, our particular views of ethical behavior (which are much more important to many of us than the whims of any corrupt legal system), not to mention all the technicalities like color balancing, trapping, encoding, all blah blah blah to you. <br> <br>In some ways the world of fonts is very frustrating, in other ways it has a depth and a richness that for example graphic design per se will never have. I for one would very much dislike being called a graphic designer. <br> <br>Yeah, there's very little money in type design (except for the top bananas), but that just means that many of us do it out of love, and there's nothing better than that. So please show a little bit of respect, not least because -if you're going to stick around- it's really better for *you*. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> as a graphic designer (never called myself anything else, despite all the distractions of 'interface architect', 'information designer', 'multimedia designer' te al) I take some offence at your statement Hrant (not too much, just a little).

It's just that different disciplines require different qualities to be [considered] successful in, and type design (certainly text type design) requires a depth that's in a way "optional" in graphic design.

<div class=commentbody> To coin a clich&#233;: I feel like we need some closure here. This was one of the most interesting discussions I've seen at Typophile. On the one hand I feel vindicated by Miles' revelations about the direct link to Melior - although he is still short on the technical details of his work - but on the other hand I realize it's a serious charge if you accuse a designer of wholesale "borrowing" of another designer's specific bezier curves and points and it shouldn't be made lightly. <br> <br>I don't think, however that we should automatically get down on our hands and knees if and when a *name* designer happens to speak up here. The Typophile forums are not like a fan club where, if a celebrity makes an appearance then everyone lines up to get their autograph and basks in the glory of their brief attention; it's more like (I'd hope) a place of learning and interaction that experienced practitioners might frequent and be subject to interesting and sometimes difficult questions from the students. <br> <br>Back to Verona: From his words, Miles is clearly revisiting the design but it is not a revival but a reinterpretation. His integrity shows in the work itself (but we could do with a sample text setting at 12 point, don't you think) and in the fact that he came here to discuss the work. Unfortunately, I don't think the hard core font rip-off artists are likely to frequent Typophile, except perhaps for trolling, and so it's unlikely their "work" will be put under the Typophile microsope in the same fashion. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Fellow Designer: <br>Respect is a two-way street, and a good environment can only be created through active good-will. I think it takes a lot of gall to make any recommendations to Miles without first admitting that you incorrectly assumed the worst about his character, using that assumption to make a public attack. Please apologize before you preach. He has been atypically (for a type designer) gracious and humble in not lashing back. Stephen made the same mistake as you (a mistake I myself have made a number of times in the past - like when I once incorrectly accused ParaType of plagiarism - but I apologized pronto), but at least he has the sense to keep quiet. But I guess being anonymous has its advantages... On the other hand, I'd start using a new pseudonym now, since this one has been tainted. <br> <br>Martin: <br>Since rip-offs and shoddy corporate beahavior are commonplace these days, one might be excused for assuming that Melior/Zapf got short-changed. But we should all express relief that this was a case where the original got its full due. On the other hand, I totally agree that celebrity is no excuse for special treatment here. In fact, I try to give celebrities a harder time. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody>My brother Fellow Designer offers Miles very good advice. Hermann is loved and admired throughout the world and his Melior cannot be reasonably called a derivative typeface. It is his intellectual property. In this regard Hermann (and Hermann alone) has the right to ask to be consulted whenever a derivation of Melior or its digital description is being done.

<div class=commentbody> True, Sbo. We are going nowhere. It seems <br>posters are more interested in cat fights than <br>discussing the typeface up for critique. <br> <br>In the interest of shifting that trend, I'd love <br>to see a small block of body copy at 10-12 pts. <br>if possible, Miles. I know the Web is a poor <br>medium for this sort of thing, but it might help <br>us to get an idea of color, spacing and any <br>glaring inconsistencies/distractions. <br> <br>Or will Verona be used solely as a display face? <br> <br>Stephen </div>

<div class=commentbody> David, you bring up something interesting. It's something that doesn't *exactly* belong here, but this thread has already covered everything from cuisine to diminutive dogs, so I think I'll just go for it: <br> <br>It's not clear that Zapf intended Melior to be a newspaper face (not that intentions are everything - a careful reading of Lawson's "Anatomy" reveals that Optima for one started out *very* differently than it ended up, due [in a way] to circumstance no less), but Tracy *had* specifically called it that; *however*, Gurtler (a veritable living legend when it comes to newspaper design) explicitly refused to consider it as such in his landmark article about the history of news faces (upto the mid-80s) in Typografische Monatsblaetter. What's your view? <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Verona is intended only as a titling type, I think it's far too condensed for text, at 12 point it's going to look tedious and cramped. <br>I've designed an accompanying sans for text, and the amounts of text I'm dealing with are a paragraph long at most. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Hrant (and Miles) <br> <br>I agree that Verona is and should be a display face, although I would like to see some more settings. <br> <br>I also agree that Melior is not a good newspaper face. In the Chronicle, it was tedious and uninviting in such large blocks. I think it also dated the look of the paper for the years it was used. <br> <br>Here's another question: <br>(and I'll even tie it in to the thread <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> ) <br> <br>Miles: With which text face is Verona intended to be used, in the context of the client's corporate identity? <br> <br>And a more general question, posed to everyone, which perhaps might be better suited to its own thread: What are your favorite newspaper faces? (Or text faces that can be applied to newspaper text?) <br> <br>David </div>
