  for you: I have drawn letters under Illustrator CS that could actually lead to the
  whole alphabet, and I'm thinking that it would be great to gather them into an actual
  font.\r\nMatter is I have no idea how to do that...\r\nWhat software to use as a
  start? Is that easy to transfer the actual vector letters I've drawn to these softs?\r\nThanks
  a lot for your wisdom and knowledge as usual.\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDr.D"

    href="http://www.fontlab.com/cgibin/at.cgi?a=310911">Fontlab</a>. Leslie Cabarga's
    book, "Learn FontLab Fast" will also help. Sadly, his site is down, but you can
    order it at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learn-FontLab-Fast-Leslie-Cabarga/dp/0965762858">Amazon</a>.
