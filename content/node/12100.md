body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI'll be getting started on a redesign for a healthcare book
  that used Optima as the headline style and Garamond as the body. This new book is
  part of a series and the publishers want to stick with Optima as the headline style
  but is willing to consider another body face. Does anyone have any suggestions for
  me to explore? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\nTammy"

    right now that uses Optima for headings and Zapf's own <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/melior/">Melior</a>
    for body text. I think it looks sharp. For some reason I find that Melior looks
    kind of "scientific" in a friendly way -- it must be something with the squarish
    letterforms -- so it would be appropriate for a book on healthcare.

    but dig to the RETAIL fonts and you'll find it."

    I can experiment. Thanks for the suggestion.

  body: speter. boy for a second there I thought I *had* linked to typophile. I checked
    my code and it is for MacRhino. So I'd say that it is a bug.But a bizarre-o bug.
