body: "\r\nWe proudly announce a new release in our award winning typeface family.
  'Lavigne Text' is a 4 weights package optimized for ease of reading at small sizes.
  It features generous x-height, short ascenders and descenders, open counters and
  simplified details that improve its reproduction at small sizes.\r\n\r\n'Lavigne
  Text' has also a solid presence on paper and its weight make it ideal for the setting
  of fine books and magazines. Used in conjunction with 'Lavigne Display', they make
  a perfect team, bringing aesthetic consistency at every typographic hierarchy. \r\nThe
  philosophy behind the 'Lavigne type family' is to achieve the refinements observed
  in classic 'modern serif' typefaces, without borrowing too much from history.\r\n\r\nAll
  'Lavigne Text' versions have been produced in OpenType format and every weight has
  its own small caps. Features are available to easily set superscript and subscripts
  numbers, an extensive set of fractions, four sets of numbers (proportional old style,
  tabular old style, proportional lining, and tabular lining), matching currency symbols,
  case sensitive glyphs, and ligatures.\r\n\r\nLavigne Text can be purchased at FontShop:

    example of small text would be very welcome.\r\n\r\nCongrats!"
