  body: "I'm no type veteran, but I think the swashes may be a customisation of an
    italic face, not real swashes. Observe the connection of the ascender of \"h\"
    as it interloops into the custom swash T (which looks very much like a C).\r\n\r\nI'll
    see if I can ID the italic face though, I'm desperate for my first ID! ;)\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'd like to point out that this is not ITC Bookman Swash (the type family
    Geoff linked to) but the original Bookman Swash, which was digitised as <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000085">Jukebox
    Bookman</a> by [[Jason Walcott]] (<a href="http://www.veer.com/products/vendor.aspx?vendor=JBT">Jukebox
    Type</a>) and recently released through [[Veer]]'s <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/vendor.aspx?vendor=umt">Umbrella</a>
    collection.

  body: Yes, it's the original Bookman Bold Italic w/Swash alright, but the big C
    is custom. There is also some customization where the h in Chaperone connects
    to the T in The, and the extra long descender on the p.
