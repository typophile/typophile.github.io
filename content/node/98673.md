    to work in the first post. Can this be true?"

    not just paper, but ink and metal were improved considerably in the 18th century.\r\n\r\nSecondly,
    technological determinism won\u2019t wash, when there were other cultural factors
    at play. As John Hudson has noted, the role of the writing masters (and perhaps
    pen technology?) was important. \r\n\r\nThe idea that Baskerville\u2019s type
    was the game-changer in enabling the neoclassical Didone style is a myth. The
    Foulis publishers in Scotland were producing neo-classical types and typography,
    in the context of printing classical literature (from ancient Greece and Rome),
    prior to Baskerville\u2019s work.\r\n\r\nI am sure there were other dynamics in
    France and Germany which contributed to the emergence of the didone style. Certainly,
    one man can make a huge difference, but design happens when there is a convergence
    of possibilities in the broad ecology of culture."

    history by ranting against his type, warning readers that they would go blind
    from reading it.\r\n\r\nI remember reading about the link between Baskerville's
    type and his paper many years ago (though the source eludes my memory, as so many
    important things do). \r\n\r\nChanges in printing and prepress technology often
    spawn changes in the design aesthetic. I believe the introduction of Quark Xpress
    was to blame for the Great Drop Shadow Epidemic of the early 1990s."

    quality printing. And Baskerville played an important role in making printing
    of this higher quality available.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, the improvement
    in the basic capability of printing things with finer detail on paper would have
    taken place without Baskerville as technology progressed; that's true too.\r\n\r\nBut
    without Baskerville pointing the way, perhaps the revolution in printing would
    have taken place too late for Didot and Bodoni.\r\n\r\nStill, wouldn't Didones
    - like slab-serifs, Clarendons, and Latins (wedge-serifs) - have been almost \"inevitable\",
    rather than being easily subject to butterfly-effect erasure? I'm not sure psychohistory
    has progressed to the level which would allow us to answer such questions."

  body: "<em>Changes in printing and prepress technology often spawn changes in the
    design aesthetic.</em>\r\n\r\nIn this case, I think the clear evidence is that
    it was the other way round: the aesthetic development drove changes in papermaking
    and printing technology. The neoclassical aesthetic that Baskerville applied to
    typography with such great success by way of his fine presswork and, yes, ideal
    paper, had been the dominant aesthetic in scribal text production for several
    decades before Baskerville had his types cut, and as Nick notes there were other
    printer publishers seeking ways to apply this aesthetic to typography.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the stranger things I have found examples of in my research on the English
    writing masters of the early 18th Century is occasional examples of engraved copy
    books with typeset prefatory matter, usually in Caslon's types. The disconnect
    between the aesthetic of the type and that of the engraved handwritten designs
    that follow is jarring to me, and I believe it was to the makers of these books
    too, especially the scribes whose work was displayed. My thesis is that during
    the first half of the 18th Century writing masters were devising a new page aesthetic
    in keeping with the emerging neoclassicism in architecture and the other arts,
    and that this aesthetic then drove improvements in printing and papermaking that
    would enable it to be applied to typography."

  body: "Thanks, Nick. I think I have seen this before. As you note, the layout is
    very neoclassical. It is difficult to judge the type -- samples of the Foulis
    lowercase in text would be more revealing, I think -- but the C has a definite
    neoclassical form.\r\n\r\nOne finds formal roman capitals engraved in a neoclassical
    style very early: even in the latter 17th Century. These, from an engraved a portrait
    of John Seddon published in 1695, are practically Didone in their modulation and
    rationality:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JS1695_6370.png]"

    famously related by Ben Franklin -- that Baskerville's types dazzled readers and
    would make them go blind. But by 1803 positive commentary celebrated Baskerville's
    achievement:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The extraordinary efforts which have of late years
    been made to produce the finest models of Printing Types, must be highly gratifying
    to those who have in any measure interested themselves in raising the credit of
    the BRITISH PRESS. The spirit for this species of beauty has long been gaining
    ascendancy, having received a strong impulse from the talents of Baskerville,
    who endeavoured to combine sharpness and perfection of impression, with graceful
    types, giving to his works a finish which was before unknown in this kingdom.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n[John
