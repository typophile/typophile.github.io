  is based on the typeface <a href=\"http://t26.com/fonts/Orgasmia\">Orgasmia Outline</a>
  by Brito Renato (t26.com) but I have altered the \"o\" and the \"t\" to make every
  letter consist of (only) one self-intersecting line.\r\n\r\nI like how the letters
  are both pixel-based and drawn with a line.\r\nThe name \" o m k r e t s \" means
  \"circumference\" or \"orbit\" (sort of) in Swedish.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me what
  you think!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nM\xE5rten"

    I applaud your desire to be creative, and I can see the effort that went into
    this. \r\n\r\nHowever, honestly, it's rather difficult to read.\r\n\r\nIt's not
    going to be particularly useful in tiny sizes\u2014a good logo should be readable
    under even the most stringent, adverse conditions. \r\n\r\nVery faddish and likely
    to seem anachronistic in the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nAnd most importantly,
    no concept. What's the idea? What's it trying to say? If their name means circumference
    or orbit or something to that effect, perhaps that would be a starting point for
    an idea-based logo as opposed to just a really cool typeface logo."

  body: "Thank you very much for your comments so far!\r\n\r\nI realize it doesn't
    work so well in small sizes, maybe a filled version is better.\r\n\r\nI'll try
    to explain the idea behind the logo:\r\nThese images describe the \"spirit\" of
    the name and the company:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/omkrets-what-1_5705.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/omkrets-what-3_4800.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/omkrets-what-4_3486.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/omkrets-what-5_4810.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
    about enclosing or encircling space in an orbiting fashion.\r\n\r\nI wanted to
    use something curly, like a script typeface, but still funky or contemporary.
    I tried these fonts first:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/omkrets-easyscript_4846.gif]\r\nEasyscript
    from <a href=\"http://lineto.com\">Lineto</a>\r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/omkrets-kulukundis_5183.gif]\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kulukundis-itc/\">Kulukundis</a>\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the single stroke look (especially rounded endpoints, like in Easyscript) I think
    relates to architectural drawings in a way.\r\n\r\nI hope this clarifies the intention.\r\nPerhaps
    there is a better way to express it in the logotype?\r\n"

  body: "Just a general thought on the name.\r\nI'm swedish too and omkrets is a very
    round word and I really expect to see soft round shapes on a logotype witch uses
    the name omkrets. When I look at that first version it goes in the direct opposite
    of what I was expecting to see.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that a scrpt or serif wouldn't
    work that was just the first thing that came to mind.\r\n\r\nEncircling space
    in an orbiting fashion is a cool idea though. You could try to have the encircled
    space form the letters and the orbiting space filled with a color, could create
    some interesting forms. Might be difficult with some letters but it would be interesting
    to see."

    to form the rest of the word as script. I was not so successful when trying to
    draw this more properly.\r\n\r\nAnother example of the orbiting line:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dashed-line_4834.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    realize my proposed logo at the top is quite stiff and square compared to these

    circles and a clean sans serif? I'm not sure I understand your idea about \"the
    encircled space form[ing] the letters\" could you try to explain more please?\r\n\r\nI
    also just tried this (don't laugh!):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dont-laugh_6309.PNG]\r\n\r\nI

  body: "><em>It\u2019s about enclosing or encircling space in an orbiting fashion.</em>\r\n\r\nFor
    what it's worth...\r\n\r\nRaw pure Architecture (cap. A) is not about enclosing
    or encircling space... <em>It</em> 'moves' with space and is 'of' space - just
    as you 'move' and are 'of' Life (cap. L). And if you really want to get down to
    it, it's space that defines mass. Beethoven wrote that he composed the space <em>between</em>
    the notes...  \r\n\r\nA current trend/fashion in architecture (lower case 'a')
    is deconstructivism (think Gehry et. al), and to that flavor I think your concept
    is somewhat appropriate.\r\n \r\nBtw, take a look at the work of Torii Ippo and
    his contemporaries at:  http://www.textilearts.com/bamboo/index.html .\r\n\r\n...I'm
    beginning to ramble.\r\n\r\n_________\r\nHiro\r\n\r\n"

    body: "@aegirthor:\r\nThanks, I have the feeling you are absolutely right.\r\nI'm
      just not sure how to make it come out nicely...\r\n\r\nYou see, I tried something
      similar before and I wasn't very pleased with it:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test1_3911.png]\r\n\r\n@kattttor:\r\n(Great
      to have someone Swedish commenting on the actual name!)\r\nYes, architecture
      is very precise, but does that necessarily mean perfect circles and squares?
      I don't think so. Many other forms can be 'precise' or 'simple' in a much more
      interesting way. Also, a circle is not the only thing that has a 'circumference'
      (omkrets), right?. \r\n\r\nI don't want to emphasize on the circle too much
      because I think this interpretation is narrowing down the concept of 'omkrets'
      to just 'circumference of a circle'.\r\n\r\nHowever I have chosen three typefaces
      that I like, with circular 'o' just for you!\r\n\r\nGlaser Stencil:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/glaser

      do you think? Was there another typeface you had in mind? Please show me!\r\n\r\n@Hiroshige:\r\nInteresting
      point. \r\nLuckily, architecture is wide enough to embrace any definition of
      it.\r\n \r\nThere were some amazing designs on the Bamboo page! Thanks for sharing
      this link. I think I could be happy spending the rest of my life making baskets.
      It seems tricky though, ten years just to get started...\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n/M\xE5rten"
