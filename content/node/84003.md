  some basic tips, but still new to the whole thing. Would be very helpful if somebody
  could take a look at the text below and give me some advice on kerning. I thought
  I understand the basic rules, but I struggle to get decent result.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.22mar.com/kerning.jpg\" />"

    of other typographic knowledge.\r\nhttp://briem.net/\r\nBecause even your round
    letters here have square sides you will need to optically determine the volume
    of white space contained between letters. The T, for instance can be tucked into
    the A a bit more while the OR combo is quite tight. The L will be problematic
    no matter what.\r\n"

    accustomed in designing the [L] narrower. This helps in an amazing way. So does
    having ligatures like [L_A] and the like. :)"
