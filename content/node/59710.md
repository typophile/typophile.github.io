  body: "The typeface Genath reminded me of something better-known, and I suspect
    the person posting the query had thought it was one of the common standby typefaces
    listed in the normal references like Perpetua, Garamond, Lutetia, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn
    looking for more information, I came across [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nonpareille/stockmar/
    Stockmar]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/maiola/ Maiola]]...
    so many beautiful typefaces go unnoticed.\r\n\r\nHowever, I've found <em>another</em>
    typeface that has the same kind of unusual italic \"r\" as this one. Starling.
    (Obviously this isn't Starling; the lowercase \"a\", for example, is much too
    much an oldstyle one.)"
