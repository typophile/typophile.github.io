  body: "It does look like a font, but of course it could be custom, for a corporation
    this size.\r\n\r\nI have been looking through the Script ID Guide, and noticed
    that <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptSmall5/Malbeck.gif\"> 'Malbeck'</a>
    by Alejandro Paul & Angel Koziupa (Umbrella Type at Veer) has a lot of similarities.
    That might be an alternative, if we don't find the actual font.\r\n\r\n- Mike
