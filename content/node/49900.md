body: "What is this for...err...it\u2019s a little difficult to explain.\r\nBasically,
  it\u2019s just a personal project. I am designing various paraphernalia to accompany
  a  short story, that I\u2019ve written (badly) in the style of 19 century Russian
  plays. So far, I have the cover and remaining pages, set according to the rules
  of pre-revolutionary orthography, a business card of a German doctor working in
  Viennese Krankenhaus, a photocopy of a catalog page, and a picture of the family
  crest.\r\n\r\nThere is no real point to any of this, just idle play in the spare
  time between the boring in-house jobs. At the same time, I want to make sure everything
  looks and feels as authentic as possible, without major anachronisms. I am trying
  to watch my styles, content and typefaces, packing the imagery with a plethora of
  hidden clues. Does anything immediately jump out at you as either historically incorrect,
  or aesthetically appalling?\r\n\r\nThe Cover of the play\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cover_4701.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe

    with their games.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about 19th century Russian pamphlet
    and business card printing to discuss any anachronisms, but I did notice that
    on your business card you have \"von Habsburg,\" while in your case file it says
    \"von Hapsburg.\" Also, on the business card, I thought that \"von\" was spaced
    too far from \"Habsburg.\" To me it looks like:\r\nDr. Heinrich von _ Habsburg
    [underscore added because Typophile was automatically removing the extra space].\r\n\r\nedit:
    It also says \"Sain Petersburg,\" which I assume should be \"Saint Petersburg?\""

  body: I'm seeing some anachronistic typefaces--Times New Roman (1930s), Palatino
    (1950s), Adobe Garamond (1990s). More appropriate to the 19th century would be
    something like Monotype Modern or Nick Shinn's new Scotch Modern, or perhaps Ronaldson.
    However, I don't know if any of these would be appropriate for Cyrillic for that
    period. Apart from that, the designs are beautiful.

  body: "nice project. looks like fun!\r\n\r\nsome notes on the business card:\r\nthe
    illustration with those black shadows smells like late 20th century.\r\nand besides,
    would a doctor have a picture of the hospital he is working at on his business
    card? i\u2019m not sure, but i don\u2019t think so.\r\nwould he have titles \u2013
    in addition to his academic grade \u2013 written on the card? \r\nyou bet!\r\nwhat
    was Habsburg\u2019s position at the hospital? the card would certainly tell that.\r\nalso,
    the address is very minimalistic. no Klinik, Station, Ambulanz or Abteilung?\r\n\r\nthe
    \"1090 Wien\" tells us that the card was not printed before the late 1960s when
    four-digit postal codes were introduced in Austria. (before that it would have
    been \"Wien IX\")\r\n\r\nand: W\xE4hringer G\xFCrtel is the location of the New
    General Hospital (Allgemeines Krankenhaus), built during the 1970s:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AKH-Bild_4273.jpg]\r\nthe
    Narrenturm depicted on the card is located near the corner Spitalgasse/Sensengasse.
    as a psychiatric clinic it was in use until 1866. later it served as a museum."

    descends below the caps height of the address.\r\nno problem with computer or
    photo typesetting.\r\nbut very unlikely with hot metal. negative leading?!"

  body: "Thank you for the kind works and wonderful critiques.\r\n\r\nJustin:\r\n1.Habsburg
    is certainly misspelled, though I'd probably let it stay as the catalog is meant
    to be written rather sloppily (as indicated by the amount of corrections already
    in place)\r\n2.I've no idea how I've missed that extra space though.\r\n3.Sain
    Petersburg is just sloppy, thanks for pointing it out, my eyes just glanced over
    it for some reason.\r\n\r\nMark:\r\n1. I agree on the type choices, although I
    reasoned that using modern revivals of historic faces would be a pretty minor
    offense. I might rethink my choices once I get a few fonts that are more appropriate
    (if I can convince some clients to get them for their projects first :))\r\n2.
    The choice of Palatino was a bit forced as it's the only thing I currently have
    that has extended Cyrillic support for outdated letters as well as a good range
    of Latin ones.\r\n3. Did I use Times NR somewhere?\r\n\r\nKatharina:\r\n1 The
    funny thing is, I had a Capital F there originally, but then somehow became convinced
    it should've been a lowercase one. I'll get that fixed.\r\n\r\nViktor:\r\n1. I
    need to have a recognizable depiction of the fools tower as part of the plot,
    a clue to the underlying mystery. I agree that it might warrant a redrawing though.\r\n2.
    Thanks for the tip about the address!\r\n3. 1866 actually fits quite nicely.\r\n4.
    That G wouldn't be a problem if the top line was actually a cliche, as these scripty
    things often tended to be. Just a regular type-height block shaped like an L,
    extending to the base of the second line.\r\n\r\nJelmar:\r\n/bows\r\n\r\nBTW The
    display type on the cover was my first attempt at type design. I think the inexperience
    shows, although these sort of graphics were often somewhat wonky.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again everyone, I might post some improvements and a few new pieces as things
    develop. Though I still haven't the foggiest what is it all for.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal
