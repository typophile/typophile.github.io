  or a good technique to morph two photos?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to morph a photo of my
  friend from when he was in high school to an image of present day. He'll be turning
  the big 40 and his wife is throwing a surprise party. I wanted to do a six or seven
  image morph that would be printed in the invitations but also use an animation on
  the video biography. Does this make sense?"

    downloaded NorrkrossMorphX_2.9.3 and a how-to for GIMP. I was hoping someone has
    already had some experience with any given plug-in and could recommend one that
    works really well. This seems to be more of an animation technique from a stand
    alone program. '

    and is quite expensive.\r\n\r\nbut honestly, i bet you could do what you want
    directly in photoshop with a little trickery, masks, fingerpaint tool, and transparency.
    it's a bit of a retouching job, but since you don't need motion it might be fun
    to try."
