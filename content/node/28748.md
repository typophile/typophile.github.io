  body: "There is NO consensus, as in a previous thread:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/27727\r\n\r\nIn
    the US, Chicago Manual of Style says no spaces around dashes but sometimes you
    need to kern or add a thin space when they are too close to the type. The UK seems
    to have a different style.\r\n\r\nI found another thread on this subject too...\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/27727\r\n\r\nI
    should add that I'm a traditionalist on this score - but I come from book publishing
    where the editors are real sticklers for Chicago. It is most important (in my
    book pardon the pun) to be consistent in your use of dashes so as not to confuse
    the reader. The em and en dashes should be distinct from one another both in style
    and usage. Unfortunately their length varies widely from font to font."

  body: "Depends what dashes you use, in what context, and also where/in what language:
    Apparently, there's a \"tradition\" \u2013 or at least a tendency \u2013 in anglo-american
    countries to use them without spaces, but with spaces in contentinal europe. Having
    spaces around dashes appears to become more and more popular in anglo-american
    countries, too, as of late. I think there's a thread on here where your topic
    was discussed in full length\u2026"

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.apstylebook.com/index.php\">AP style</a> is to \"put
    a space on both sides of a dash in all uses except the start of a paragraph [their
    version of a bulleted list] and sports agate summaries.\" See \"Punctuation\"
    chapter.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html\">Chicago
    style</a> is not as explicit, but all the examples in the 15th ed. do not contain
    preceding or following spaces (e.g.: \"It was a revival of the most potent image
    in modern democracy\u2014the revolutionary idea.\"). See sec. 6.87ff.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Illustrated-William-Strunk/dp/1594200696/sr=8-1/qid=1160586190/ref=sr_1_1/102-4802936-5414569?ie=UTF8&s=books\">Strunk
    & White</a> are not explicit either, but also do not include spaces (e.g.: \"The
    rear axle began to make a noise\u2014a grinding, chattering, teeth-gritting rasp.\").
    See sec. I.8.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792055/sr=8-2/qid=1160586226/ref=pd_bbs_2/102-4802936-5414569?ie=UTF8&s=books\">Bringhurst</a>
    recommends using en dashes set off with spaces: \"Used as a phrase marker \u2013
    thus \u2013 the en dash is set with a normal word space either side.\" See sec.
    5.2ff.\r\n\r\nI don't have MLA or APA style guides handy, but I'll hunt around
    for 'em \u2014 er, (bad) pun intended."

  body: The style I like to follow is to used a space around the en dash when it is
    used in place of an em dash (which often breaks up the color of a page). However,
    where an en dash is expected (war of 1914-18, pp. 33-45, etc.) then there should
    not be any spaces.
