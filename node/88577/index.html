After having my agented book (http://shrapnel-memoir.com/) make the rounds and not find a publishing home, I've decided to bring this book, which I very much believe in, to press on my own. 

I've been told by many of my fellow writers that some of the most talented designers are to be found here, which is why I'm now knocking on your door. See, I'm seeking a designer to design/format my manuscript for both print publishing (via CreatSpace or Lightscribe) as well as eBook publishing (Mobi, ePub, iPad...). 

The length is approximately 85,000 words, with no images in the manuscript itself. If you are interested, please shoot me an email with rate quotes and/or any questions you may have to at d.harrisgershon(at)gmail(dot)com

Thanks so much, Typophile.

skills in terms of broader graphic design otherwise I'd give
it a shot myself.

BTW one way this thread could be useful would be for people
to suggest suitable typefaces for consideration by whoever
ends up designing the book for you.

Considering the Semitic (by which I include Arabic) nature
of the topic something with heavy horizontals, reminiscent
of the Hebrew and Arabic writing systems, might be cool.

As for your suggestion of a typeface, I'm quite intrigued by it. I'd never considered choosing a font based on a Semitic aesthetic, but would be very interested to see examples of fonts with heavy horizontals that could be reminiscent.

BTW, in terms of display typography this is probably the single
best occasion to use Ine Beerten's amazing work that unifies the
Latin, Arabic and Hebrew writing systems!
http://www.inebeerten.be/typedesign_images/peace4.jpg
Even if the font she's made might not serve you as-is, she can
probably design an amazing one-off title for you in that style.

Typography is subtle power. Here's a book cover that uses the
blackletter style ("Jihad") to underhandedly link Islam to the Nazis:

I will say this much: I occasionally design books, and I would never pick a typeface from the title or blurb description. You have to read at least a portion of the text.

As for Rich, see 

http://www.amazon.com/Book-Design-Mr-Richard-Hendel/dp/0300075707

There are a few book designers who visit Typophile (Rich isn't one of them); they can reply if interested.

I would think that some photos of your wife's injuries and her recover would be very appropriate and would add to the book's impact, especially if placed near the text describing those events. 

> for both print publishing ...[and] eBook 

Make sure that the portfolios of the designers you talk to include examples of both print books and ebooks that they've designed. Ask for references so you can contact some of their previous clients to ask how the jobs went. Be sure your contract includes at least a general timeframe. 

And be aware that most design jobs go through several rounds of revisions, which may be additional charges unless the original estimate includes a certain number of rounds of revisions. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mr. Michaels: From the description of the book, it doesn't seem to me pictures of wounds would help the journey. Up to the author, and how & what he wishes to communicate with his readers, of course. IMO, most book interiors are not exercises in graphic design, no pun intended.

As to ebook formatting: basically, Kindle and iPAD let the reader do the designing, with very limited choices. IMSLTHO, at this point in ebook development, any attempt to control the presentation at best works for one device, but is almost guaranteed to "break" on others. Again, up to the author whether he wants an ebook or an app.

Finally, with text & no pictures, how much back & forth can there be about the interior design? Author doesn't like the text measure or margins? The display type? The text type?  If these can't be resolved quickly, a kill fee may be involved. Sometimes the title page occasions issues. Now the jacket is a different story. That's where a "graphic designer" could be appropriate.</div>

Hrant: <cite>“I'm a typeface designer with poor

Hrant, I’m afraid I have to agree with you. I’m sorry to say so but you seem to have given proof of that in this very thread. If you only could for once in your life be silent one hour.

The aping of a particular writing system’s characteristics in a font of another writing system may be a funny exercise for fontists, however it will never lead to a decent choice of typographical materialisation for a matter most serious like the story in question. I speak as a font designer *and* as a book designer and I am a little sad that such advice is aired here, since the kind of idle mockery you propose has very very sad connotations [[http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&sa=N&rls=org.mozilla:de:official&biw=1600&bih=911&tbm=isch&tbnid=F6-m8o8y8zfMWM:&imgrefurl=http://cyberlog.wordpress.com/category/jude/&docid=iUD2MueE_otnfM&imgurl=http://cyberlog.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/jude.jpg&w=300&h=381&ei=cxr3TpyRJsW-8AO21JGpAQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=368&vpy=409&dur=55&hovh=253&hovw=199&tx=131&ty=146&sig=107610855900198368522&page=3&tbnh=161&tbnw=141&start=74&ndsp=36&ved=1t:429,r:1,s:74|with regard to Hebrew in particular]] (see linked image). Please forgive my harsh words, but I feel challenged as a designer who thinks of design being the art of shaping, not of disguising.

I appreciate your suggestions regarding portfolios and checking on time frames. As for pictures -- no, that's not really something that would be appropriate for this, nor something I would want to include.

Hebrew and Arabic, literally showing that they can coexist,
which is a central theme here.

However I do have less faith in suggesting Ine's efforts
than I do in my earlier suggestion of using a body font
with Semitic "stroke" contrast. Here are two candidates:

http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/pampatype/quimera/
Both (especially the second) are... unsettling. But I have to
think that's one more way such a choice makes sense here.

Maybe only the titling/heading font could be of such a style?
If so, the work of Excoffon and Bloemsma could serve well.

And I deny that two things can coexist any longer when they have been melted and cast into something third (here: Latin). To me that kind of interprettion is a crucial misunderstanding. It’s different if one talks about a possible harmonization or of clashing things together. Ine’s font, witty as it is, remains a chimera and is not a synthesis.

<cite>Semitic "stroke" contrast  </cite>
A stroke contrast pattern like this is not “semitic” per se. Stressing the horizontal parts can well be something [[http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&sa=N&rls=org.mozilla:de:official&biw=1600&bih=911&tbm=isch&tbnid=jJK1tNKEbBqGuM:&imgrefurl=http://college.belrem.free.fr/idd/rustica/rustica.htm&docid=GENg0Wu6_wTtLM&imgurl=http://college.belrem.free.fr/idd/rustica/rustica.jpg&w=700&h=362&ei=elv3TqPWL4bh8AO-lNWyAQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=1082&vpy=563&dur=1765&hovh=161&hovw=312&tx=176&ty=93&sig=107610855900198368522&page=1&tbnh=116&tbnw=225&start=0&ndsp=26&ved=1t:429,r:18,s:0|Latin]], it occurs in many other writing systems as well.

Though both Hebrew and Arabic typically feature a horizontal stressing they remain still essentially different in their specific stroke pattern and detail anatonomy. </div>

I understand. However I noticed you included some photos (not of your wife) on your web pages, which to me indicates you understand that graphics can sometimes be of value. 

Keep in mind that photos wouldn't need to be of the awful attack itself or need to show injuries; they could be of the people prior to the attack to help make them more vivid to the readers; of the locations where the events took place; of your wife after her recovery, etc.  Just an idea to consider.</div>

Well I'm hoping the author considers using some pictures, as I've seen them used effectively in some books which have related themes. Entirely up to him, of course.

But even without pictures, the amount of work involved can vary depending on the author's wishes. I've been involved with self-published book projects where the author asked me to set the entire book (this is for print, not an ebook) because he wanted professional help with things like proper punctuation (he had hyphens and dashes mixed up, for example), ellipses (he inadventently used several different styles), widows and orphans, smart quotes, proper use of italics, good line breaks and page breaks, etc. 

It gave his book a more professional look, and he was happy to pay for that service. Many authors would choose to save some money by doing all that themselves, of course.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've designed a few self-published books. You can take a look at my site: jltypographicdesign.com — though the more recent stuff isn't up there yet. In addition to CreateSpace, I have used Lulu, another print-on-demand service, and been pleased with the results.

I have a particular interest in Judaism and Jewish books, and Hebrew typography. I've not done e-books before, but would be willing to take the leap. Your story sounds very compelling.

I've taken a look and realized I had very few examples of book design on my site. I've just uploaded a couple more, if you'd like to take a look. Good luck with this project!
