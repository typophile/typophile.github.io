    Illustrator and people were very helpful and knowledgeable. There was also an
    article about exactly this topic in the March 2004 issue of &#34;the Design Authority&#34;
    from Element K Journals, which I just got as a promo in the mail.

    can&#39;t anyone have a normal skin anymore, or  <BR>a normal, average body for
    that matter? I really don&#39;t  <BR>get this obsession with fake. Who wants plastic
    skin?
