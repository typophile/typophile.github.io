body: "Hey All,\r\n\r\nI am s-t-ruggling with a logo at the moment. It is for Uni,
  we are to create a logo for a restaraunt called temple. Philosophy of it is that
  eating is meant to be taken in the same manner of worship or prayer. The food is
  supposed to be fulfilling, soul enriching and some other bullshit along those lines.\r\n\r\nAfter
  all my ideas i still came back to a fat little buddha with a smile on his face,
  really worked conveying the enjoyment of the food, the fulfillment of eating it
  (fatty fatty boomba).\r\n\r\nIn the below logo i have used ITC Officina Sans Bold,
  i feel it combines the curves and points of the illustration. It is fat, plump and
  stumpy just like my little comrade. It also has a laid back feel to it with the
  heads tilting back like someone lounging right back on a couch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/temple2_5825.gif]\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nAny
  help what so ever is much appreciated, thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nKen"

  body: "I think the type is too heavy, did you try the Book weight?\r\n\r\nAnother
    approach would be to play with the idea of an altar, only with food rather than
    candles, offerings, or icons.\r\n\r\nI don't find this idea to be bullshit at
    all - feeding the body does feed the soul. Americans eat microwavable dinners
    and drink big gulps, all in front of the TV or gameboy or while driving, and look
    at how fat and lethargic they are."

  body: "I don't think that's a bad idea at all, I quite like the Buddha illustration.
    Regarding the logotype itself, I like that too. It just looks a bit too rigid
    right now, maybe you should do something to make it unique. Maybe make the ascenders
    and descenders a bit longer, and slightly bent? Or perhaps do a little flourish
    sort of thing with the descender of the \"p\" or the ascender of the \"l\"? Maybe
    make the \"te\" and \"le ligatures? Something rather subtle. \r\n\r\n"

  body: i think to match the quality of the illustration, you really need something
    soft like <a href="http://vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/Omnes/mudTyper+Weights/">Omnes</a>
    or even <a href="http://vllg.com/Underware/Sauna/mudTyper+Weights/">Sauna</a>,
    although not really a sans, but i can't really think of it as a serif either.

  body: "And try all-caps: not only will it look heavier, but it would nicely allude
    to oriental writing systems. Also, maybe place the buddha on the right (or if
    not, h-flip it to face the name). BTW, if you want Really Fat, try Motter Corpus.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
