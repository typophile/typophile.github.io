  decided to chose two separate pages in my sketchbook and combine them into one to
  make the page more interesting. I chose two entries that had elements that I liked
  but were too simple on their own. I wanted to do something with my 'hand-drawn type'
  page {skeletal} and my 'favorite' page {tape}. \r\n\r\nMy concept was a page that
  celebrated imperfections and truly encompassed the 'hand-drawn'. I added color and
  took apart and re-pieced together sections to create the final outcome. It is still
  simple because I don't like a busy page, but yet it is more interesting than the
  original.\r\n\r\nI was inspired by the work of Stefan Sagmeister and his hand-drawn
  type and the postmodern era. Last semester, I created a type specimen book for the
  font Blockhead, and this page reminds me of it. I am always apprehensive in using
  my hand and this was something that was a stretch for me."

    and I have to say, I think it's pretty amazing. Because you used an old book,
    it gives the whole thing this cohesiveness which is really nice. Not to mention
    a lot of your entries have a very clean and neat quality about them. By looking
    at it, you seem to really enjoy your sketchbook, when a lot of us look at it just
    another thing we need to get done. You've inspired me to embrace my sketchbook
    a little more..so thanks! =)\r\n\r\n(A little side note about this blog entry
    itself...I really like how you kept the sketchiness behind the word skeletal.
    It let's it keep some hand drawn qualities which I'm always a fan of.)"

  body: Katie, I also wanted to comment on this particular piece. I really love how
    you pulled the two pages together. Separated they seem a little bare, but you
    were able to form a solid composition pulling a couple of shapes from one page.
    I love the subtle use of color as well; it is a nice accent to the over all concept.
    Like Cali, I love hand drawn type. Another thing that sticks out to me is the
    repetition of geometric shapes in the page. The folded down corners seem to draw
    the viewers eye to the rest of the page, even if it was just an accident. Anyways,
    I think this piece goes to show that composition can still be great using simple
    shapes and materials.
