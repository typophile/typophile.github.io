There are some spectacular examples of typefaces used badly, or wrongly chosen for the application at hand. Assuming a typeface meets the criteria its designer set out to achieve, both technically and aesthetically, I don&rsquo;t think one can say any particular face can be called &ldquo;bad&rdquo; or &ldquo;good&rdquo;.</div>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s an easy shot these days, but in Emigre&rsquo;s heyday, few would step up to the plate in a public forum to protest. Did I say few? I meant two.</p>
<p>Digitally speaking, it&rsquo;s quite easy to distinguish a technically bad typeface; convert it to letterpress. Emigre&rsquo;s fonts are dismal failures. Even Journal is quite goofy, and it is the one Emigre face I like a lot. Apparently, if you can&rsquo;t draw or punchcut a typeface, letterpress technology will just show you for what you are. This has nothing to do with &ldquo;worst&rdquo; (which is apparently an aesthetic decision), just &ldquo;bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why would you expect faces designed for one medium to work in another without adaptation?
You know how much difficulty there has always been in adapting the foundry classics to new technology, whether hot metal, photo, or digital, offset or monitor.
Would you attempt to print a finely-detailed 19th century face designed for coated paper on a laid rag stock, in the manner of 17th century printing?</p>
<p><em>expire the lame typefaces</em></p>
<p>I once retired a typeface, but people still kept wanting to buy it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As a typographer - I&rsquo;d say any typeface misued - such as the menu I had to try to read yesterday. Alba in 8 point for descriptions of named foods&hellip; - yikes!</p>
<p>If James R. Harris would be alive to respond - he&rsquo;d tell you ITC Eras. Why? Because it doesn&rsquo;t lean enough to be an oblique/italic and it isn&rsquo;t straight up &ndash; it&rsquo;s just there, in limbo - leaning&hellip;.</p>
<p>Personally, I hold a grudge towards HOBO. I can&rsquo;t stand that face. A quickie job came up for a window washer - and his font was HOBO&hellip; why - because he made his logo himself and HOBO was on the darn computer&hellip;. LOL</p>
<p>P.S. In defense of Emigre - when the faces first hit the publishing industry - they were quickly embraced &ndash; but for front cover type. How many time did Tony Greco use Matrix &ndash; oh, and it worked? Not all their faces are winners, but they did add a nice amount of a &ldquo;new&rdquo; style to help folks create new looks for front covers&hellip;.</p>
<p>Triplex got its time in there &ndash; and who could forget Mason - it was ahead of it&rsquo;s time&hellip; okay so 3 fonts in heavy use for a year or two is still quite a typographical accomplishment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>How do you say a font is bad, let alone worst? Doesn’t it depend too much on personal preferences?</cite></p>
<p>It’s usually a personal thing, but in some cases fonts are just bad from practical or functional standpoints. Arial is a bad font because it tries to be a Helvetica knockoff, but inconsistently blends features of Helvetica and MT Grot to create something truly ugly. Comic sans fails because it doesn’t actually look like comic book lettering.</p>
<p>Of course, this sort of reasoning can break down pretty quickly. For example, many of the Emigre fonts often fail at being useful outside the context of Emigre, or even being legible at all. But they did succeed at creating a dialog about type and type design that had a huge impact on design and has survived the magazine itself, so they succeeded conceptually as a catalyst for furthering creativity.</p>

<p>Do you really think &ldquo;blending features&rdquo; was Robin Nicholas' modus operandi?
Look at the other faces he has designed, such as Nimrod and Clarion.
He is a more accomplished designer than Max Miedinger.
As you note with reference to MT Grotesque, Robin went back to the 19th century grotesque. In so doing he was ahead of the trend that has recently seen several foundries release grots in that quirkier, older genre.
Arial would get more respect if it had been hyped like Helvetica, but the foundry BS is lacking&ndash;generally the best they do is apologize for it, saying it&rsquo;s a good screen font! 
It could be argued that Arial is a deconstruction of Helvetica, putting some fibre back into the white bread.</p>

<p>That doesn’t make Arial any better—nobody’s perfect. Ed Benguiat is more accomplished than either of the two, and he knocked out a few bad types, too.</p>

<p>Can you tell me where I can read more about those details? The best I’ve read on the matter is Mark Simonson’s <em>The Scourge of Arial</em> which points to MT grot as the source, and I have seen that article cited by other sources I consider reputable. As for Arial being a trailblazing design, that may be so, but Arial is still pretty hard on the eyes, at least IMHO.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t believe everything you read.
Why not open the fonts up and compare them?</p>
<p><em>nobody’s perfect.</em></p>
<p>I thought you were talking about the process (&ldquo;blending features&rdquo;) not the end result.</p>
<p><em>Can you tell me where I can read more about those details? </em></p>
<p>As I said, open up the fonts.
Also, take a look at some printed samples of grots from c.1900 (not revivals, even a little nuance loses the flavour of the original, as can be seen with G.G. Lange&rsquo;s Akzidenz Grotesk).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">This list of bad typefaces is getting long! And once upon a time I used to be the first to sniff haughtily whenever the word Mistral was mentioned. That is, until I stumbled across some quite nice stuff back from the 1950&rsquo;s. Take a look at this picture. I think Mistral works quite well with these colours.This thread shows how easy it is to make a list with all the bad typefaces. Maybe we should start another with the best ones instead? Clarendon is my all time favorite.<img src="/images/old-images/Mistral_4089.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think Arial is getting nearly enough attention. I think that when you factor in the impact a given typeface has had on the world, Arial is by far the worst thing to ever happen to typography.</p>
<p>On a purely technical level, Arial is horrendous. Glyphs like the capital C and the lowercase g are so outrageously lumpy and malformed it honestly looks like the product of someone working through his first or second week of experience with Bezier tools. Calling it &ldquo;amateur&rdquo; is a genuine understatement as even most amateurs would presumably have the dignity to keep such terribly drawn glyphs from being released.</p>
<p>If I could sum up my criticism of the face, it&rsquo;s that ultimately, it suffers from a shocking lack of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always seen Arial as much more a clone of Univers than Helvetica (compare the 1, the lowercase t, the capital G and even the R&ndash; that god awful R&ndash; to some extent, among many other examples). But when compared to either of these two fine works, Arial&rsquo;s flaws are even more apparent. Helvetica and Univers, regardless of your subjective take on them, both offer stable balance and details. The letters fit together nicely and the curves within each glyph look intentionally placed by a qualified designer. Arial has none of these qualities; words and sentences look cobbled together, stroke thickness seems to bend and warp, and it&rsquo;s wonky curves careen along their paths like bumper cars.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the worst aspects of its design is the way horizontal edges don&rsquo;t run parallel to the baseline. For an example of how this can be done right, look at something like Akzidenz Grotesk or Franklin Gothic. These fonts use this characteristic create a slightly less formal, cheerier atmosphere than something like Univers or Helvetica might. But in the case of Arial, unlike these far superior fonts, it looks like a mistake rather than an intentional aspect of the design.</p>
<p>Nowadays, though, the worst part about Arial is it&rsquo;s nightmarish ubiquity. Sometimes I feel like it&rsquo;s closing in on me, like something out of the Twilight Zone. It really does appear to vastly outnumber the use of Helvetica on local signage around shopping centers and mom-and-pop shops (at least here in Northern California). Signs like these tend to be awful from the start, often stretched and compressed in non-uniform ways or kerned recklessly (if at all). But it&rsquo;s insult to injury when Arial is used instead of a standby like Helvetica, as it combines an already bad design with an even worse typeface.</p>
<p>Far more concerning, however, is its sudden prevalence in serious media, such as feature films and television, by designers who should honestly know better. Look at the logo for the show Ugly Betty; unless they were trying to make some kind of typographical joke that plays on the show&rsquo;s title, what could they have possibly been thinking? I remember seeing it in the trailer for the movie Over the Hedge, in the on-screen graphics for the mock newscasts in V for Vendetta, and even the TITLES and end credits in Michael Clayton for god&rsquo;s sake. What kind of bizarro world is this?</p>
<p>Anyway, don&rsquo;t interpret my overuse of dramatic adjectives as being tongue-in-cheek; for all my whining, I really do mean it when I say Arial is the worst thing to happen to typography. Comic Sans doesn&rsquo;t even compare&ndash; it may not be the world&rsquo;s greatest art, but it&rsquo;s a gimmicky font that was never trying to be anything more than that. Arial, with the help of Windows, has unfortunately presented itself to the world as a serious alternative to some of the pillars of typography, when it&rsquo;s little more than an insult in my opinion.</p>
<p>Phew! Glad I finally let that out!</p>

<p>Funny some mention Myriad here.</p>
<p>I just come back from letypographe.com, a french forum run by Jean-Francois Porchez (and others fine typographers), where I&rsquo;ve been bashed <em>big time</em> for saying that Myriad owes a lot (i mean A LOT) to Frutiger.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told there that Myriad bears the influence of Sumner Stone, that it is way more &ldquo;calligraphic&rdquo;&hellip; All things I don&rsquo;t contest, but still&hellip; No Frutiger, no Myriad, am I alone to think that way?</p>
<p>I mean, if you read the official documentation of Avenir, for example, Futura is mentioned as inspiration, things are clear. But Adobe&rsquo;s staff never aknowledged Frutiger to be at the origin of Myriad.</p>
<p><em>SLIGHTLY OFF TOPIC MODE OFF</em></p>
<p>Just to say that I&rsquo;m not crazy about Myriad either :-)</p>

<p>I live in Istanbul, and the poorness of typographic culture in the last 30 years is making any typophile suffering on an every day basis, when looking at the shops, packagings and advertisements (although the trend is slowly changing since 2-3 years thanks to people like, huh, me, among a few others). You think I&rsquo;m kidding? Do you know how many books are available, in turkish language, about typography? ONE. It was released earlier this year, and it&rsquo;s not very good. There is a new magazine since one and a half year which talks about type in a quite nice and interesting way, and people are beginning to open to type culture&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; but still, most of the time, we have to say hello to some absolutely horrid typefaces, composed in huge sizes and ugly colors. So, let me add to the list the ones I see very often here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Chancery</li>
<li>University Roman</li>
<li>Stop</li>
<li>Revue</li>
<li>Flash / Slager</li>
<li>Balloon</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; Sorry I can&rsquo;t continue I feel sick.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Myriad is not Frutiger; look at the M for example. Yes they are similar, yes the look and feel are close. But I can say the same thing about dozens of other typeface comparisons.</p>
<p>And as far as that goes, you can make the case that nearly ALL of the popular, contemporary, corporate-style humanist sans out there today are merely derivative of good old Frutiger and Officina Sans.</p>
<p>Typefaces I hate? I despise anything with a &ldquo;Benguiat&rdquo; in its name. The appeal of Bank Gothic totally escapes me. Most script faces are just plain annoying.  If one more Windows user sends me a file formatted in Trebuchet, I may hurt someone. And I loathe Arial with every fiber of my being.</p>

I mention this because really I think anything that is overused should be avoided (The same goes for

and most clients look for less expensive solutions as well. Individuality is where it is at.</div>

<p>Yes in name, Myriad is not Frutiger - but oh my &mdash; there is no doubt where they stole their design. This one has been through the courts, and I understand it was settled.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure turks can love typo books, whatever they may look like&hellip; then, why nobody&rsquo;s writing one? Is there a lot of typo books in Bulgaria?</p>
<p>Haley, and some others:</p>
<p>In my own opinion, Arial is good for nothing. I&rsquo;ve seen it WAY too much on quickly designed and printed stuff everywhere, right out of MS Word or MS Publisher or MS Whatever. It&rsquo;s been polluting the whole environment, worse than petrol in the ocean. You might dislike Helvetica for various reasons, but its design is so much better than Arial. I&rsquo;ve been a typo teacher, and you would be AMAZED by the amount of students who just can&rsquo;t make the difference between Arial and Helvetica. This is a disgrace&hellip; I mean, quality alternatives for Helvetica, if needed, are available: Univers, Akzidenz Grotesk, Folio, etc. But Arial&hellip; Whatever you say, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, it will always be a cheap type commissioned by a big corporate in order to not pay the rights to use Helvetica. Someone said up there that Nicholas Robin is a much better type designer than Max Miedinger: if so, He would have the ethics to not make Arial the way it was done. I&rsquo;m sure Vincent Connarre is a great guy too, but nevertheless He greatly contributed to the poorness of taste in the worldwide typographic environment with his freak creation Comic Sans.</p>

<p>Vince - I&rsquo;m surprised that you are still trying to make the case that your typeface is popular due to its design. Comic Sans doesn&rsquo;t deserve all the ribbing it gets, but the cold harsh truth is: if Comic Sans wasn&rsquo;t bundled with Windows we wouldn&rsquo;t be talking about it and I doubt anyone would be using it.</div>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Comic Sans doesn&rsquo;t rule. Comis Sans sucks. Big time. The real Vincent Connare knows enough about type to know that&rsquo;s the truth. It is successful for 2 very basic reasons: it was, as mentionned above, bundled with Windows; and 95% of the computer users in the whole world have a total lack of good taste, not only computer or font related but in general. Good taste comes with education and some given skills or hunger for artistic / aesthetic self improvement, which most of the world is lacking, that&rsquo;s a pity but that&rsquo;s the truth. Most of these people are very nice, very sweet, totally harmless and inoffensive, my own sister prints her reports in Comic Sans. She also wears clothes which make my eyes bleed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know your surname is not french, I was making a joke, and you are pretty rude out there, you actually deserve your name. Next time you visit france or quebec, make sure to spell your celtic god name out loud, the result will make my revenge.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>p.s. anyone who creates a type in a vague comic book style and gives it out with windows will blow your rates away and send you back to oblivion, my friend. check the faces at blambot.com: they are in the same spirit with comic sans, though 100 times better. If you had designed these ones, the whole world would feel better. you once said that comic sans was never designed to make it on windows and be spread that much, and you felt sorry for that. at that time, i liked you. now you are very proud to state that mister everyone is picking your font over the other ones, which makes your design awesome. I don&rsquo;t hate you&hellip; no, I just have some pity.</p>
<p>But anyway, you are not him, right?, I mean, the real vince connare would not be that much rudely childish, right?</p>
<p>right?</p>

<p>of course, even though these works are quite old now for i dont have time to update my web, you can go and take a look at <a href="http://www.davidrault.com">www.davidrault.com</a>. keep 2 things in mind though: i am not a typographer, so you wont find any typefaces there (so far), and my harsh comment on comic sans was also fueled by what vince told me in the previous post, which litterally means &ldquo;go f*** yourself&rdquo; in english. otherwise i&rsquo;d be bad, but not that bad. but the hell with it, comic sans sucks, i can say it in any language if you want, if i can&rsquo;t say what i think here, i can say it nowhere. try not to take it personally every time someone says something bad about microsoft related things.</p>
<p>this being said, feel free to criticize anything you see. too bad i can not post my latest and nicest jobs, for these are packaging jobs and as long as the customer didnt give it a go and the didnt hit the shelves, i cant put them online&hellip; i will try to put some, though, to actually get some critics. some of my stuff suck big time too, i know it, i&rsquo;m not an artist, i have to please some stupid customers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I find it most interesting that the most vilified fonts fall into the categories of rip-offs, and &ldquo;write-offs.&rdquo; Enough about rip-offs, and inappropriate use aside, what make Mistral, Comic Sans, Sand and Papyrus so hateful, even to ones who like all fonts, is that we don&rsquo;t like to them scaleable. It disturbs me to try and make a written font for more than a single size, so I&rsquo;m guessing that it disturbs us when a single outline is used to represent what we expect to be a range of proportions and a variety of edge qualities. Digital outlines at their worst, bringing out the worst in typophiles, I&rsquo;d say.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have a theory about all this: Some typefaces are novice magnets.</p>
<p>To the average person, most fonts look more or less the same. But, if a typeface has a strong flavor, it calls attention to itself. It&rsquo;s easy to recognize and makes people feel like they know something about fonts when they recognize it. And it looks &ldquo;special&rdquo; compared to normal (i.e., boring) fonts, so using it makes their documents look &ldquo;special.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the experienced designer, such typefaces have too much flavor, call too much attention to themselves, not to mention the fact that often carry the baggage of being associated with amateur design.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Mark, I agree, but I think that for some people it’s also force of habit. For a long time Arial and Times New Roman were the only decent fonts many people had on their desktop machines, so we just got used to them. Over time better fonts have been phased in, but nobody is telling people “stop using crap fonts and start using Palatino!” Maybe Simon could subtly trick people into using better fonts by getting Microsoft to push all those great new fonts as a selling point for Vista and Office 2007.</div>

It seems to be the details that people object to, which aren&rsquo;t really apparent at text size.</p>
<p>Times, however, although a single master, is the most serviceable of &ldquo;web&rdquo; serif faces at larger sizes, as the sharp serifs do give it some measure of finesse.</p>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>Recently I came across a site on Gutenberg in Comic sans. But will you all excuse me if I waffle on a bit about a typeface alluded to earlier in this discussion? Is that allowed?</p>
<p>On page 1 it was nice to see someone speak up for Excoffon&rsquo;s masterpiece Mistral. Good for you Mr Small caps (or Ms small caps if you are a woman&hellip; personally I hate the &lsquo;politically correct&rsquo; Ms, but I&rsquo;m not a woman&hellip;). Excoffon designed this type for the Olive foundry&rsquo;s clients who were mostly small letterpress printers in France and francophone countries still setting type by hand. He certainly didn&rsquo;t design Mistral for graphic designers (who were fairly thin on the ground in Europe in the fifties). In fact Mistral has always been a favouite of &lsquo;popular graphics&rsquo;. Serious graphic designers wouldn&rsquo;t touch it with a barge pole. Nevertheless, even us sophisticated designers should be able to appreciate that much type which dwells firmly within popular graphics is worthy of our appreciation (and perhaps devotion) even though we would never use it. Look at Novarese&rsquo;s superb STOP. I have an archive of about a 150 photos of signs, logos and whatnot in STOP (not to mention Mistral). But let&rsquo;s get back to Mistral again for a moment. John Dreyfus wrote a highly appreciative piece on Mistral in the Penrose annual of 1956. For many years it was the only face available that gave a convincing idea of quickly written spontaneous handwriting. Obviously Mistral no longer represents the handwriting of today but it is still the most popular of all the &lsquo;handwriting&rsquo; typefaces or, to use a more colourful expression, &lsquo;shopping list&rsquo; typefaces that have sprung up since the digital revolution: I mean faces that don&rsquo;t show off a calligrapher&rsquo;s handwriting, but are able to give an impression of decent handwriting of the sort we might do for a shopping list. But Mistral is far more than just a decent imitation of handwriting. In the game of bluff and deception that is implicit in all &lsquo;shopping list&rsquo; faces, Excoffon plays a masterful hand. Of course&hellip; designers might prefer real handwriting to fake handwriting but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>The version of Mistral that was (or maybe still is) installed in Bill Gates' systems is a real abomination and a horrid travesty of Excoffon&rsquo;s work. ITC put out a light version of Mistral designed by Phil Grimshaw in 1997 (complete with small caps and stacks of ligs). This was another masterpiece and a very fitting tribute to Excoffon. But it seems to have been a commercial fiasco probably because popular graphics is — quite understandably — not interested in paying for fonts.</p>
<p>Small caps admires the colourful brochure for Mistral, and so do I. Excoffon himself designed other beautiful handouts for his faces. And this is another point worth emphasizing. Don&rsquo;t you all think that it is time for an exhibition of typefounders advertisments? There&rsquo;s much more to be said of Mistral (and of course of its designer too), but I&rsquo;ll stop here to avoid an impulse to write a whole article.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll finish up by returning to the original subject of this discussion &lsquo;The worst typefaces&rsquo;. Someone mentioned ROTIS and I thoroughly agree. Why is ROTIS such an awful face? Because it is a hybrid. Upstairs it tries to be 19th century and downstairs it&rsquo;s Renaissance. I can&rsquo;t stand it.</p>
<p>Sorry for being so long winded and I apologise for having written too much about one of my favourites rather than the contrary.</p>

<p>And Gräfenberg, I am not a fan of Gill Sans, but as a former typesetter learned a long time ago that every font (yes even Comic Book Sans) has a place - and that somewhere there is a perfect job for it. I happened to have been given a business card recently, and it was a delight to see &ndash; and then I realized the face I was looking at was Gill Sans Italic. Perhaps since no one I know has used it since 1992 &ndash; it was just a pleasure to see.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s face it (groan, sorry for the pun) there are some pretty ugly glyphs in it - worst being the <strong>a</strong> - and its irregularity I find grating*.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t in any way mean to imply that it can&rsquo;t look OK:

<p>Lots of ‘ugly’ fonts can be used with skill. Doesn&rsquo;t stop them from being ugly in themselves :-)</p>
<p>*Compare it to Granby for example, much more successful as a design overall IMHO.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">&hellip; and I agree with your opinion about Waldorf fonts. I designed a special section of a magazine a few years ago about Rudolf Steiner.  I had never heard of this style of font before and couldn&rsquo;t believe people used them with a straight face. It would probably work for The Flintstones, though.</div>

<p>Yes - They do use that stuff with a straight face.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I am sorry to disagree with Mark, even a year later, but the Waldorf typeface would be great with a woodcut design. It is reminiscent of a Jugend cover or a magazine in that style from a century ago. Perhaps not with the outline version or the &ldquo;quark&rdquo; shadow, which are awful.</div>
