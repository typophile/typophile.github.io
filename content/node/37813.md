  My group for a typography project has chosen the type face poliphilus for a typography
  profile project.\r\n\r\nI was just wondering if anyone knows any good Books or resources
  to find some information about this font. There is obviously some very basic information
  about the type face on Linotype and other type websites. However I am looking for
  some possibly more in depth Information on the designer Aldus Manutius. Any help
  would be greatly appreciated\r\n\r\nThank you"

    a good account of the design process of Poliphilus, with lots of food for thought.\r\n\r\nHoefler's
    Historical Allsorts may be compared."
