  products &#40;I&#39;m told&#41;. I&#39;ve quite grown on the Latin &#40;that is
  to say, not the Korean chars&#41; part of Batang, but only the regular variant is
  included. <BR> <BR>Does someone know the font shown? Is there an italics? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  noticed that several of the UNICODE languages seem to have interesting Latin charsets,
  but no further identification. I presume these are some other typeface that&#39;s
  being included in these Asia-targeted packages.

  body: Hi Mickey, <BR> <BR><i> Is there an italics? </i> <BR> <BR>No italics. The
    current version of Korean font character standards requires to include the Korean
    ASCII character set called KS-Roman for the <i>Romaja</i> part which consists
    of 94 letters only.
