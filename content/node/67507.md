    is often seen as redundant or a plain error).

  body: "I'm not sure why only ordinal masculine and ordinal feminine are given (well,
    likely a backwards-compatibility issue), because even in Spanish it's possible
    to have something other than \xBA or \xAA:\r\n\r\nOfficially, when used with numbers
    they should always go after a period (DPHD: numerales: 1).  In practice, they
    might not, and visually I think it's best to kern them pretty much directly over
    the period, or even better, combine them such that the period appears more as
    a combining underdot.\r\n\r\nThe most common endings are -o and -a, but they can
    also be used in the plural, -os and -as.  Additionally, primero and tercero (and
    all ordinals that end with them) have an apocoptic singular form -er.\r\n\r\nThey're
    not just used on numbers though, and are often found in abbreviations, most especially
    M\xAA for Mar\xEDa.  But I've seen hrmn^os for \"hermanos\" amongst others.  (edit:
    unlike French, in Spanish they should become capital in all, though limitations
    in computer typography make this less common in day-to-day typing)\r\n\r\nMy ultimate
    recommendation is to make a good superscript variant and place the o and a from
    that into the \xBA and \xAA of the regular, since that covers you for other languages
    that might have even more complex forms.  Opentype coding to place the dot(s)
    is just a superficial nicety."

  body: "Nick: (Speaking strictly about Spanish) Underscore is seen too, but I think,
    without much basis in actual knowledge, that's an English influence to it.  In
    handwriting one doesn't place a mark under it nearly as much as much as we do
    in English.  But, for the record doing it 1.\xBA with the \xBA being underlined
    is seen in the standards as an option (explicitly contrasted with 1.\xBA without
    an underline).  But that just looks too busy for my taste.  The dot satisfies
    the \"correctness\" [insert smirking mock] and the visual nicety.  Now what would
    be really fancy is to have the long over-tilde for abbreviations that went out
    of fashion about 150-250 years ago on inscriptions.  But OT isn't great for variable-letter
    diacritics."

  body: FWIW the Microsoft website suggests that the underscore performs a distinguishing
    task (so  the ordmasculine is not mistaken for a degree, which is more easily
    done at small sizes). I was instructed to put an underscore under them at an early
    stage by more than one typeface designer. Maybe the confusion with the degree
    was their reasoning?

  body: Is it correct to assume though that underscores wouldn't be a good idea for
    any other superscripted letters than just the ordfeminine and ordmasculine? So
    in a fuller set, no underscores would be better in terms of coherence and versatility?

  body: Nina, I don't ever remember seeing another letter (apart from a and o) with
    an underscore. However here in the North West (of England), one often sees superior
    letters in old signage that do have a solid/continuous underline (e.g.B^ROS and
    L^TD).

    they are all based squarely on a series of mathematical transformations of the

    Some designers also give the glyphs a bit of a stretch in the x-direction too
    but there are only so many hours in the day.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, my lower case
    superiors have a slightly bigger x-height relative to the caps superiors compared
    with the original upper and lower case.\r\n\r\nYou also get some very particular
    and thorough designers who add accented superiors so as not to disappoint, for
    example, continental European users."

    feminine and masculine are part of the written Spanish language.\r\n1\xBA means
    first masculine (primero), 2\xAA means second feminine (segunda), and so on: Piso
    34\xBA = 34th Floor. You have to work with all the numbers that would need kerning\r\nIf
    your font has only caps or caps and small caps you can use the caps as ordinals.\r\nWhen
    has upper and lowercase than your ordinals should be lowercase.\r\nThe old fashion
    is to underscore the ordinals.\r\nBut you can also eliminate the underscore.\r\nI
    am working with a Caps/Small caps alphabet and I send you a sample of the matter.\r\nRegards,

    it make more sense to call them ordmasculine.cap and ordfeminine.cap or does .cap

    explains what that glyph is to verify it is in the correct class.
