body: "I'm curious about type designers workflow in regards to complete type families
  that range from the extremes of Hairline/Thin to ExtraBold/Black, including italics.\r\n\r\nThe
  reason I ask is that I understand it comes down to individual preferences, but I'm
  wondering if there is a standard that carries over through everyones process.\r\n\r\nI'm
  most comfortable starting with a 'Regular' weight and then moving towards either
  light or bold extremes and with FontLab Studios limitations using Multiple Masters
  it seems it would be best to develop either extreme first then generate instances
  in between.\r\n\r\nI also understand that external tools such as Superpolator can
  help develop styles beyond the limitations of developing weights with FontLab Studio
  alone.\r\n\r\nRegardless of what tools are being used, is it best to develop either
  extreme first Thin/Black and generate instances in between, or is it just personal
  preference? What is the most efficient workflow when developing full typeface families?\r\n\r\nIf
  you have a chance to briefly comment on your process it would be appreciated."

  body: It probably depends on the particular typeface. A monoline sans serif could
    probably begin anywhere but, if there is a lot of diagonal contrast and/or serious
    ink traps, it would probably be better to develop the two extremes and work toward
    the middle.

  body: "First I made a regular (to see if the proposed font was viable).\r\n\r\nThen
    I made a bold (I figured a regular needs a bold complement).\r\n\r\nThen I made
    a MM and extrapolated to get a heavy master then made necessary adjustments to
    the heavy master.\r\n\r\nThen I made a MM between the regular and the heavy and
    extrapolated to get a thin master then made the necessary adjustments to the thin
    master.\r\n\r\nI then made a MM between the thin and the heavy and interpolated
    to see if the regular was anything like my first regular. I was pleasantly surprised
    to find it was better!\r\n\r\nNot sure why I did it like this but it worked for
    me.\r\n\r\nFor another font, I started of with a hairline and then went right
    up to the other end of the weight spectrum to get instant masters but was far
    less satisfied with what lay in between :(\r\n\r\nOf course some will insist on
    more than two extreme masters on the weight axis and you can see why when you
    start getting very heavy and very thin."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nI figure it varies depending on the style
    of typeface and I can see how it would be easier to work extremes in a monoline
    face.\r\n\r\nI think I'm going to stick with the original vision for the particular
    type in the Regular weight\u2026 from there develop a Bold\u2026 then generate
    instances to open up the design space and towards the end generate any extremes
    such as Hairline or ExtraBlack.\r\n\r\nFor myself it's highly unlikely for a text
    face that I would ever start designing with either extreme as there seems to be
    more room to design and finesse a particular design with something that lies in
    the Regular weight range. \r\n\r\nOf course it depends on the initial vision for
    a design as some display types are inspired and created from the start as really
    light or heavy weight.\r\n\r\nI think I was just looking to see if anyone would
    state that they have an absolute process for developing more complete type families
    that they never stray from, but the more I think about it the process must vary
    greatly between designers for one, and for two between the particular style of
    type that is being designed."
