  BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I am setting a brochure where both of the two text columns of
  an A4 page are almost filled with bullet points. My dilemma is this: do I hang the
  bullets outside the margin or not? Opinions on this matter are appreciated! <BR>

  body: 'I think the problem here is that the writer is misusing bullet points. These
    should highlight &#42;short&#42; lists. It is absurd have a page full of bullets,
    as they no longer highlight anything. I think they will look bad wherever you
    put them.  <BR> <BR>I think the bullets need to go. Then you can try a variety
    of solutions, such as having the titles bigger or bolder and the list as is, indented
    without the bullets, with items separated by extra leading. Or have the lists
    with hanging indents, no bullet, etc.    '

  body: 'BTW I agree with William. It is absurd to have this many bullets on the page.
    It can show a lack of ability to write short concise copy using proper English.
    <BR> <BR>You could mockup a page with bullet points turned into paragraphs to
    show that you will have a greater economy of space '

    and overuse of the bullet point, the question was &#34;to hang or not?&#34; In
    my experience, bullet points hang outside of the margin. I hang to the left, but
    that&#39;s another matter. <BR> <BR>'

  body: I&#39;d suggest no bullets and more spacing between each paragraph instead.
    Bullets used like this typically distract from the content. <BR> <BR>All that
    said, when I use bullets, they don&#39;t hang outside of the main body margins.
    I consider them &#39;sub-points&#39; to the main text, and, like in an outline,
    need to be indented to show hierarchy.

  body: I agree with darrel. As subordinant points they shouldn&#39;t hang. But do
    try to get rid of them altogether.

  body: tom and darrel <BR> <BR>I agree with you that subordinant points shouldn&#39;t
    hang &#40;unless you use a small font&#41;. <BR> <BR>However, in this case the
    points are virtually the entire text and are in fact the reason why people would
    choose to attend the particular session at the conference. <BR> <BR>In this instance
    it is much cleaner to have the strong left alignment. <BR> <BR>

  body: Maybe we&#39;re talking about two different things. <BR> <BR>I think the bullet
    needs to hang from the text it is referring to, but shouldn&#39;t hange outside
    the &#39;parent text&#39; margin. <BR>
