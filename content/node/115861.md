body: "I am currently working on a project to identify a kind or style of typography
  that is used for a specific application or has a cultural association. I am working
  with the use of interlocking or connecting letterforms and scripts that often appear
  in Italian industrial design but specifically on espresso machines. \r\n\r\nI have
  begun my research and found some interesting information on the history of espresso
  machines in Italy. I have also looked into some of the books by Louise Fili about
  Italian typography/scripts. However I am still looking for more information and
  thought to cast a wider net. I have plenty of examples but am now looking for articles
  and writing that discuss this topic or topics close to it. I am trying to figure
  out where this trend comes from. Is it related to Italian futurism? Is it mostly
  to do with the ease of construction for the metal nameplates?\r\n\r\nI did find
  a foundry called [[http://holidaytype.com|Holiday Type]] that has revived or created
  typefaces that are reminiscent of the style I am talking about. I am having trouble
  finding out who is behind their designs though? Does anyone know who is the creator
  of these fonts? I wrote to Dharma Type, but does anyone know if they are behind
  the designs? I thought the creator might be of help. \r\n\r\nI am also wondering
  if these kinds of scripts have a specific name or term.\r\n\r\nI know this is vague,
  but I so appreciate any help, resources or insight. I have been doing quite a bit
  of research but just thought asking a larger and more educated community might help
  me find some new avenues to explore. \r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: "Thanks, that is really helpful! I keep hoping I am going to find something
    that relates this kind of typeface to Italy, but I might be searching for something
    that does not exist. \r\n\r\nRyoichi Tsunekawa from Dharma Type did write me back
    and gave me some useful information about his set of fonts, and they were mostly
    inspired by Italian signage during a vacation he took in Naples. "

    Chromeography link on the same page has nice pics too.\r\n\"chrome scripts\" and
    \"connected scripts\"  are probably the terms you want to web search for."

    as well and recommended writing Stephen Coles. Have been able to find some more
    research, but could still use some more specific information. Really appreciate
