body: Hi, I am currently doing a mag redesign and have chosen zapf elliptical as the
  body text face, but can&#39;t find a sans nice enough to go with it. I need one
  that would be a large family &#40;for all the various headings&amp;captions&#41;
  and would seem &#39;stylish&#39; to people at age 15-23. Or maybe one sans for short
  passages of text and another for headings/captions.. I&#39;m not sure yet. Currently
  I&#39;m stuck with Square family, as it was used in the previous design, but something
  just seems wrong.  <BR>Any suggestions appreciated <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: The Conduit thing seems quite appropriate. Thanks, Hrant <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>.  <BR>Prokyon is special, but, yes, I can&#39;t afford
    it and it doesn&#39;t quite fit the particular issue. I&#39;ll keep it in mind,
    however.  <BR>And hey, I knew there was something familiar in the Square face!
    So it&#39;s the same as Eurostile! Sweet <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> always something new. <BR>Thanks for the advice. However,
    sometimes I really don&#39;t get how you can remember all those names! This leads
    me to wonder, how many typefaces keeps in mind a standard typophile?

    it&#39;s hard to tell from Berthold&#39;s sample, but I guess that DynaGrotesk
    is probably a more interesting experiment within the genre. <BR>Is &#39;Video&#39;

    <BR> <BR>As for DynaGrotesk, Imago isn&#39;t exactly like that. Video&#39;s original
    name -&#34;CRT Gothic&#34;- actually gives a great clue about how to categorize
    Imago. It&#39;s more rigid and closed, somewhat grid-centric. <BR> <BR>And yes,
    &#34;Video&#34; is shown in the Re[trospective]. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
