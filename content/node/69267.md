body: "I am currently typesetting  a book for a client one chapter of which deals
  with quangos and in essence is a long list over five pages [230 lines in all] .
  See sample text below \r\n\r\nIreland has a lot of quangos, including (take a breath)
  Advisory Board for Irish Aid; Advisory Committee on Cultural Relations; Advisory
  Council to the Commission for Taxi Regulation; Advisory Science Council; Aer Rianta;
  Affordable Homes Partnership; Agency for Personal Service Overseas; Appeal Commissioners
  for purposes of Tax Acts; Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board; Area Development Management;
  Army Pensions Board; Arramara Teoranta; Arts Council; Attorney General; Ballyfermot
  Partnership; Ballymun Partnership; Bioresearch Ireland; Blanchardstown Area Partnership;
  Blood Transfusion Service Board; Bord Altranais; Bord Bia; Bord F\xE1ilte \xC9ireann;
  Bord Glas; Bord Iascaigh Mhara; Bord na gCon\r\n\r\nThe author and publisher would
  line this list to start at 10.5 point and gradually decrease until it become miniscule.
  I have tried a few different ideas but am not taken by any of them.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  on how to make it look good gratefully appreciated."

  body: You might try composing your list, then saving it as a PDF. Open the PDF in
    Photoshop and apply Perspective. Flatten the image, use the type tool to set one
    entry, then compare it to each line and resize it to determine the point size
    of that line...

  body: Why not post what you have up on the critique boards? It might be easier to
    give feedback/advice when looking at something.

  body: 'how about: Set your copy to the largest size you''ll b e using. Then select
    the second line and everything below it and reduce the size by one increment.
    then select the third line and every thing below it and reduce to the next smaller
    size, and so on until you get to the to the bottom. The copy will automatically
    flow to fit your column width, with a minimum of touch ups.'

  body: What Russell said seemed pretty logical to me; I was playing with doing that
    shortly after the original post & it seems to work well enough. Of course, it
    might start as "over five pages [230 lines in all]" but it doesn't end that way!
    My test with dummy text ended up about a page and a third. You'd have to experiment
    with the size of the increment (or decrement, heh) to find what will reduce to
    the overall coverage that you want...
