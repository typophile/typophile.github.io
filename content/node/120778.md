  All,\r\n\r\nI was just wanting to identify the typeface in the above logo for bzr
  by Bruun Bazaar? Is it a custom typeface? I really like the dynamic looking curves
  in it and had it in mind for a project.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAsh"

    They're listed in their clients, both from Danemark and, part of /r, looks pretty
    close to [[http://www.kontrapunkt.com/work/apoteket#section2|Pharma]], bespoke
    font exlusive for [[http://www.kontrapunkt.com/work/apoteket|apoteket]]. Their
    logo looks like Pharma as well.\r\nAlternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/steve-mehallo/jeanne-moderno|Jeanne
    Moderno]]\r\n\r\nEDIT: same idea but starting with [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/bodoni+poster|Bodoni
    Poster]] backslanting italic /b, removing /z serifs and adjusting /r ones"
