body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been looking for the typeface used in this novel. It's a high
  contrast serif with rather large X-height, but my searches have come up with nothing
  until now. Does anyone recognise this font?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/queneau_3600.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much!\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"

    have as much contrast as the one in my book. Or is the just the result of digital
    printing 'thinning' the letters?\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"
