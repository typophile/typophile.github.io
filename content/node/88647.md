body: "Hi everyone. \r\n\r\nI've been in the design Industry for a number of years
  but never really 'clicked' (if you will) the whole dimension of what typography
  is about.\r\n\r\nI've stumbled on section dealing with typography in print and on
  the web in a book called Production for Graphic Designers. After that I was a bit
  curious to say the least. What really caught my attention was the part about Akzidenz
  Grotesk that was kind of revamped into Helvetica. The fact that I almost saw no
  difference even if it seemed to be a big deal made me curious, REALLY curious. What
  am I missing, what am I not seeing? I can see there is a difference but jeez - come
  on.\r\n\r\nRight, so I went rummaging through my old University stuff for anything
  I could find dealing with type. There was very little. So, I headed for google and
  there are tons of stuff like, The best 25 Open Fonts, top 10 must have free fonts,
  10 fonts that changed the shape of design etc. etc. But where is the really deep
  stuff, the stuff that will satisfy this relentless curiosity!\r\nDamn it.\r\n\r\nSo
  now I am here. Are there any Typogrpahy obsessed people that might help enlighten
  me on what to look for. What I mean is: I've fired up some software to start playing
  with some well known fonts to see what the hell these people are seeing. Honestly,
  I can't seem to wrap my head around what the big deal is. I want to, I really do.
  It's like looking at one of those old 3D images, you know the ones where you had
  to mess up the focus point of your eyes to see the image. Everyone is seeing the
  bloody things but you seem to stare at a mass of minute and irrelevant nonsense.
  Or so it feels.\r\n\r\nSome of you might be shocked at the way a so-called designer
  seems to think how irrelevant type is. I don't, I understand it's importance but
  not to the depth and intensity some other designers do. And it's bothering me. \r\n\r\nSome
  books I want to get (after a bit of google searching):\r\n- Thinking with Type\r\n-
  Complete Typography manual\r\n- Any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nMaybe the whole typography
  world is a kind of a mental 'tuning in' to get the best insight. Dunno, but the
  way typographers approach a font family is pretty scary. At the moment I feel like
  a colorblind guy tripping on Benzine. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time "

    These are not technical or academic books, but simply written as an enthused amateur

    drive classically trained font designers nuts, but I thought I mention them."

    conveys that very sentiment.\r\n<em>Types of Typefaces</em> by Ben Lieberman is
    a concise overview with broad scope, in a very graphic manner.\r\nYou might also
    consider Bringhurst\u2019s style guide, but it is more geared to book work than
    general graphic design."

  body: "You're paying attention, so you will see it, don't worry.\r\n\r\nArguably
    the most important way to look at type is, strangely enough,\r\nwhat it's supposed
    to do! Convey text to the reading mind. It can get\r\ninadvisably esoteric* but
    basically the shapes of the letters aren't\r\nmerely supposed to be pretty, they
    have to respect for example what\r\nproportion of text has ascenders (parts above
    the x-line) versus\r\ndescenders (parts below the baseline) - causing Good text
    fonts to have\r\nlonger ascenders than descenders even though the latter in fact
    need\r\nmore room to look happy (especially the \"g\"). They also have to respect\r\nwhat
    makes reading easier, for example not confounding \"c\" and \"e\",\r\nor \"rn\"
    with \"m\". Helvetica versus AG? The former's letterspacing is\r\ntoo tight with
    respect to its vertical proportions, so it can't be used\r\nproperly at any point
    size for text as far as I'm concerned. Nevermind\r\nthat it's a sans font and
    serifs play a positive role in reading...\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/88563\r\n\r\nWelcome

    a book designer, not a type designer, and so the way I look at Type will be quite
    different than a 'pure' type designer. But as such, I was surely impressed when
    I was asked to typeset a single dictionary page in Lexicon, for the publisher
    to take a look at and consider. Art! I didn't even have to help it!"

  body: "@David\r\nGreat stuff! Very practical hands-on guides. Fontographer seems
    pretty good but I've also found FontForge. Dunno if they are both geared toward
    different goals.\r\n\r\nShinn\r\nOkay, I'll go for Stop stealing sheep. It seems
    to be pop-up everywhere. Thanks. Bringhurst\u2019s style guide is very relevant
    since it seems I might be heading in that direction with a current cli\xEBnt.\r\n\r\nfrode\r\nMaybe
    I have a strange way of going about something but I'd first want to get some substantial
    background info before I start pulling beziers all over the place. ;)\r\n\r\nhrant\r\nYou
    know, you've kind of nailed the hammer on the head with the paragraph of yours.
    The stuff typographers see and take into account must be a enormous benefit! Honestly,
    I'm beginning to get the feeling Graphic Design is 50% how you use fonts. Or maybe
    it's all about negative space - something I've read a lot in connection about
    type last night.\r\n\r\nTheunis\r\nTrue. But at least balance, harmony and pattern
    are universally applicable. So as designers we should have inherent trait that
    helps us project those universal laws onto everything we see. Such as your page
    design! \r\n\r\nColes\r\nCool, thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
