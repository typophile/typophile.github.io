  body: It looks like the freebie [[http://www.dafont.com/mouse-deco.font?psize=s&text=COLORADO+STREET+BRIDgE|Mouse
    Deco]], or perhaps a mix of that with [[http://www.dafont.com/market-deco.font?psize=s&text=COLORADO+STREET+BRIDgE|Market
    Deco]]. Both are all upper case but with a few alternates on lower case glyph
    spaces.
