body: "Hi everyone!\r\nI had the unfortunate task to help my comedy group in trying
  to convert this logo in a vector based logo.\r\nI was hoping to find the original
  type of the part that said \"BIG\" and the one on the bottom of the logo \"Barcelona
  Improv Group\"\r\nThe person that did the design, doesn't have the originals, and
  doesn't know what he used, so I would love if you could possible help me in find
  it or something very similar to those types so I can recreate it in vectorial.\r\n\r\nAnd
  I thank you from the bottom of my heart for any kind of help or suggestion about
  identifying this type."

  body: '[[http://www.ffonts.net/Munkeyshine.font|Munkeyshine]] could suffice for
    the rest. maybe an extra stroke/outline would round it out a bit.'
