body: "Hey, \r\n\r\nI have a problem: When I draw in FontLab 5 I get an error that
  tells me \"Move is empty - This move point is not visible. It should be removed\".
  The error occurs when I start drawing, and the error moves away from the first point
  and on to the next when i draw a new point.\r\n\r\nI hope someone can help me, please
  see the attached screendump. \r\n\r\nTHANKS Lulu\r\n\r\n"

  body: You can simply switch off FontAudit for the time of drawing and switch it
    on for testing the result.

  body: There is no problem imho. This single point is really not visible and must
    be deleted:) After you will drow the full contour (at least 3 points and connect
    them together) the problem will be solved automatically.

  body: "\"Move is empty\" is just a silly label. The wording given by FontAudit is
    ancient, when Yuri did not speak very good English :) We'll fix it in FLS6. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"
