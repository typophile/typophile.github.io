body: "Hi.  I'm building a website for a local business, and I'd like to reuse the
  font used in the logo.  The logo was professionally done, and the individual who
  made the logo would not disclose the font used.  All the free online font identifiers
  I could find have failed me, and I was hoping maybe someone here could assist.\r\n\r\nI've
  attached the logo.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, even if you're not able to help."

  body: He WOULDN'T disclose the font he used for the logo? Unless it was a custom
    job, that sounds a bit megalomaniacal.

  body: Well, regardless, I'd like some help identifying this font, if possible.  Making
    a new logo would be completely out of the question, too, as the client already
    paid for this one and is using it.

  body: I understand - I wasn't denying you help, just throwing in an aside. It doesn't
    ring any bells as far as commercial fonts go, and unfortunately DaFont isn't playing
    ball at the moment, so I can't look there. Perhaps someone else will recognise
    it.

  body: I guess no one's had any luck so far.  I spent some time browsing around some
    more, too, and still no luck over here.
