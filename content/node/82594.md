  as digital?\r\n\r\nIt looks a bit like those fonts you can see in old photos of
  company advertising painted on houses or technical catalogs or in comic magazines.\r\n"

  body: "It looks sort of like Engravers Gothic, but the S is much more closed. If
    this is actual fabricated lettering on a building then there is no reason for
    it to be a font, although a typeface or font could have been the model for the
    lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks Justin_Ch, yes I also noticed Egiptian Sans Serif. The over all shapes
    are really close, but it lacks ray shading and drop shawdow.\r\n\r\nIt seams like
    Intellecta Design's makes fonts from raw scans of old prints. Charming, but sometimes
    you just wan't a clean digital version and do the rest yourself :D"
