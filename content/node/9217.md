body: Ok I&#39;m brand new at this, and yes this is my first typeface ever.  I know
  it&#39;s rough around the edges and needs work, but I&#39;ve been looking at it
  for so long that I need other opinions now.   <BR> <BR>It&#39;s just a fun display
  type that I sketched in my sketchbook about a month ago.  I don&#39;t know why it
  turned out the way it did, but the main shape looked like a samurai sword so I went
  from there. <BR> <BR>There probably already is a font named Samurai, but I haven&#39;t
  seen it yet so I wouldn&#39;t know. <BR> <BR>Thank you so much for the input. <BR>

  body: 'Michael,  <BR>  <BR>Congratulations on getting this far. I&#39;m confident
    you&#39;ll get some good feedback here.  <BR>  <BR>I can offer a few basic tips:  <BR>  <BR>1.
    Try not to &#34;frankenstein&#34; your letters. I&#39;m noticing that you&#39;re
    flipping &#34;n&#34; to make &#34;u&#34;, &#34;p&#34; to make &#34;q&#34;, &#34;m&#34;
    to make &#34;w&#34;, and &#34;b&#34; to make &#34;d&#34; - You&#39;re better off
    drawing a custom letter for each, and you&#39;ll get more life out of a typeface
    by doing so.  <BR>  <BR>2. The transition between large swooping arc to straight
    line feels awkward- try less contrast.  <BR>  <BR>3. Try to create consistencies
    in where you use a broad stroke versus a thin stroke. Here&#39;s a good example:
    <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/didot/charset.html" target="_blank">http://www.typography.com/catalog/didot/charset.html</a>  <BR>  <BR>4.
    Don&#39;t beat the samurai shape to death - Every letter doesn&#39;t have to have
    it to make a successful typeface. Look for other shapes to complement it.  <BR>  <BR>5.
    Finally, a word on baselines and x-heights. Create some rules in your design document
    for consistent  sizes. Right now it looks like the letters vary up and down, and
    setting some rules will help the overall design hold together. See some of the
    lowercase examples in our Type 101 course  &#40;Under &#34;Courses&#34;&#41;  <BR>  <BR>'
