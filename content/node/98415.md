  with the foundry <a href=\"http://swisstypefaces.com/\">Swiss Typefaces</a> (@swisstypefaces).
  They are in the process of designing a typeface called <strong><a href=\"http://swisstypefaces.com/fonts/euclid-bp/euclid-bp-bold/\">Euclid</a></strong>.\r\n\r\nI
  responded asking them if it was inspired by the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fountain/dessau_pro/\">Dessau
  series of typefaces</a>.\r\n\r\nThey responded \u201C<em>no</em>.\u201D\r\n\r\nI
  was particularly interested in the similarities between the [&] and [a] in <strong><a
  href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fountain/dessau_pro_zukunft/\">Dessau
  Pro Zukunft</a></strong>.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll let you decide:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Euclid
  and Dessau_5902.jpg]"

  body: "The font doesn't appear to be \"in the process of designing\", since it's
    being sold for \u20AC75.  I don't see any particular resemblance in the glyphs
    you cite. Both typefaces have what to me is a disturbing mixture of 'standard'
    glyphs and specialty letters that interrupts reading.\r\n\r\nEuclid has some very
    strange ligatures; the 'bw' looks more like a misprint than anything else! It
    has some other natural similarities to Dessau Pro Zukunft - such as Euclid's 'u'
    compared to Zukunft's 'n'.\r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I know the history of the typeface, and to quote Swiss Type, \u201C<em>Euclid
    BP is a 21st century font: not another wise revival of an early 20th century geometric
    font</em>.\u201D\r\n\r\nGonna have to play the BS card on that one.\r\n\r\n\u201C<em>I
    don't see any particular resemblance in the glyphs you cite</em>.\u201D \r\n\r\nYou\u2019re
    kidding, right?\r\n\r\nThe best I can say is that Euclid is clearly an homage
    to early 20th century geometric fonts, specifically old Futura sketches. Anything
    other than that, to me, is a bit of a stretch."

    by the original Futura sketches?\r\n\r\nSo far, I\u2019m getting a general sense
    of \u201Cno\u201D which honestly boggles my mind. As much as someone saying \u201CArial
    and Helvetia aren\u2019t really that similar.\u201D"

  body: "These two types, along with the Futura forms to which they obviously refer,
    seem to me to represent three examples of a particular genre. Renner's designs
    may be the first expression of this genre in type, but I reckon one would need
    to look at a lot of German poster and sign lettering of the 1920s to determine
    what extra-typographic inspirations he might have had.\r\n\r\nThe whole point
    of a stylistic genre is that is permits of more than one product in that style:
    different designs with common elements that make them clearly related."
