  neo-grotesk (realist sans-serif); geometric; humanist body; humanist display; renaissance;
  neoclassic; baroque; romantic; and monospace. I am still puzzling with Georgia.\r\n\r\nGeorgia
  is a wonderful web-font for display and book, but I cannot classify it perfectly.
  Do you believe it is a realist serif, baroque typeface, or...?\r\n\r\nAlso, do you
  think Century Schoolbook is a good Georgia-alternative for web-body or/and display?\r\nIs
  Century Schoolbook not somewhat different in style?\r\n\r\nThank you for you reactions.\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\nBart"

  body: Georgia is a Transitional; and, frankly, because it was designed specifically
    for video display use (and very well, indeed) rather than print, very few typefaces
    would be "good" alternatives for web use.

    few (the web safe fonts plus a couple more) are really useable across platforms.
    Additionally, at small sizes on low res displays, the characteristics of genres
    does not play as huge a role compared to the x-height, when the jump from one

    it is not that popular on Linux systems and I want to give a subtle alternative
    for if you want to pair it for example with Century Gothic or other geometric
    or realist fonts available on most computers. Century Schoolbook is also very
    readable on screen.\r\n\r\nTransitional is too broad for me for creating font
    stacks that communicate a specific era.\r\nThe information I found until now point
    in the direction that Georgia is a realist serif font, but nobody writes it plainly."

  body: <strong>Transitional</strong> is a perfectly acceptable--and limited--Vox-ATypI
    type classification and, at least according to some sources, is synonymous with
    <strong>Realist</strong>, although the former, I believe, is preferred among type
    purists. The 3.3% of computer users who use Linux can probably limp along on some
    version of Century but, unless the specific font has been optimized for screen
    use, it just won't look as good as Georgia...

    of them use fabricated terms such as 'geralde' and 'didone'. Others rely on familiar
    but vague labels such as 'old style', 'modern' and 'transitional.' All these systems
    work to a certain extend, but all leave much to be desired. They are neither good
    science nor good history.</cite>\r\n\r\nI agree with Robert. Over 100 years, what
    we now call 'modern' could be 'old' or 'transitional'. These names are temporary.\r\n\r\nCentury
    is very readable on screen and sometimes style is an important factor. It also
    depends on other things like size, line height and line width."

  body: "> Old Nick\r\nPlease allow me to bring a little French-speaking perspective
    in the debate about the word \"Realist\". \r\nIn his classification, Maximilien
    Vox gave the name \"R\xC9ALES\" to the category of typefaces which seemed to aknownledge
    the influence of the \"Romain du Roi\" (end of the seventeenth century) \u2014
    which corresponds broadly to the \"Transitional\" word used in English-speaking
    countries. The word \"R\xE9ales\" itself doesn't exist in French (it is another
    of Vox's infamous neologisms) but etymologically alludes to \"royalty\", indeed.
    \r\nI'm not sure you can equate it with \"Realist\" without causing some ambiguities
    : for example, as it was already mentioned, Bringhurst uses this very term for
    nineteenth-century typefaces (Clarendon, etc.) in reference to the Realist painters
    (Gustave Courbet et al.) of the same era."

    agree that Vox-aTYPI's adoption of the term only seems to cause confusion, especially
    when the picture is muddled with historical reference to Realist painting, which
    is entirely beside the point.\r\n\r\nI have been operating under the apparently
    mistaken assumption that the kind of Type Classification we were discussing was
    structural: while the first Transitionals may have been designed during a specific
    period of time, it is still possible today for someone to design a typeface that
    is essentially Transitional in structure. If one mucks up the classifications
    by adding point-in-time as definitive of style, then what are we to call a Transitional
    typeface designed today? Postmodern Semi-Scotchy? What do you call this monstrosity,

    which mixes structural facts and intellectual pretensions (IMHO). I've always
    been more at ease explaining the evolutions of type design to my students in relation
    to art history, which sometimes clarifies a few points : I can't, for example,
    put Fournier (in essence a rococo stylist) and Baskerville (an early neo-classicist)
    in the same \"R\xE9ales\" bag (without even mentioning the fact that the name
    itself overemphasizes the historical importance and the influence of the whole
    \"Romain du Roi\" affair).\r\nI agree with you that historical categories are
    only points of departure (the very moment a particular style first appeared) and
    that it's still possible today to design typefaces which could eventually be labelled
    \"rococo\" (MVB Sirenne), \"neo-classical\" (FF Danubia), or whatever."
