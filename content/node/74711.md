  new Ubuntu font that Canonical commissioned typeface designers Dalton Maag to develop
  for the Ubuntu operating system has landed in Ubuntu 10.10 for all users.\r\n</em><em>\r\nThe
  font, which has been under development for almost 9 months, was only previously
  accessible through a limited beta program which saw Ubuntu members and Canonical
  employees gain access to the font for exclusive testing.\r\n</em>\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThough
  I don't think it's complete yet, at least the kerning tables aren't. \r\n\r\nAlso

  to access the TTFs."

  body: "Indeed, this first release of the fonts covers Latin A+B Extended, Greek
    Polytonic and Cyrillic Extended; and is four font styles only. The project is
    still in progress with a number of other font styles to come with the same glyph
    coverage. The four core fonts that have just been released will also be extended
    with Arabic and Hebrew.\r\n\r\nThe kern tables are as complete as you can get.
    The fonts contain both 'GPOS' kerning as well as a traditional 'kern' table. The
    'kern' table is incomplete in that we had to drop accented kern combinations due
    to technical limitations. Appls that support OpenType will have access to the
    'GPOS' and hence will find the full range of kerning, including accents.\r\n\r\nBruno"

  body: "When I first heard about this effort, I assumed it was meant to produce a
    replacement typeface for the Ubuntu logo and related titles. After reading the
    documentation, it seems to me that the goal is to produce a more broadly usable
    typeface. I'd be interested to see any examples or specimens of the typeface in
    action the way the designers intend.\r\n\r\nst"

    Maag, congratulations for having created the beautiful fonts. But why didn't you
    create the \"unicase\", monoscape and script fonts?"

  body: 'Yes, Dunwich, I knew it''s open source, but the problem is that I''m not
    good in antialasing and hinting. I can''t correct the defect of the fonts. I use
    Inkscape and FontForge. Althought Inkscape and FontForge better the letter''s
    high quality, but the letters are still aliasing and without hinting. Thye''re
    still smudgy. '
