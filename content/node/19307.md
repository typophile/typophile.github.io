body: "My client is a small semi-upscale boutique for designer infantwear. They describe
  themselves as punk, but everything looks too clean for me to endorse that fully.
  Rather, think D&G writ small, tiny rock-themed graphic Ts, asian patterns, etc.
  \r\n\r\nThey need a typeface (or two) to use across a range of publications. It
  should be suitable for body copy and headlines. I can use either a single face or
  a body/headline pairing. Their marketing strategy is entirely focused on the parents.
  The baby is framed as an accessory of sorts.\r\n\r\nThe concepts of 'punkness' and
  'infancy' are almost completely antithetical. Thus far, every combination  I have
  found comes across as a joke. Is there such a thing as clean, safe, adorable punk?
  They currently use all lowercase courier new, which is awful . . ..\r\n\r\nTim\r\n"

    area, no less. As I touched on earlier, it's not really 'punk' as I understand
    it (c.1970s London) but it's definitely edgier than any other infantwear I've
    seen. We're presenting it this way: A baby could care less what decorates her
    onsie, so her parents might as well dress her as they like until she's old enough
    to define herself . . . and very few twentysomethings would opt for Winnie the
    Poo as a personal aesthetic. \r\n\r\nAnd actually, I was completely serious about
    the Clarendon. Am I the only one to notice the Clarendon/Edgy-art-school-knitting-club
    connection? In hindsight, \"they seem favor sturdy Victorians like Clarendon\"
    has a backhanded \"women in comfortable shoes\" connotation that I absolutely
    did not intend. Sorry if I offended anyone :-/\r\n\r\n"

    am still very new at typography so this is purely a question and not a criticism...but,
    can the faces that have been suggested here really work as the body text in catalogues,

    a mock newsletter in a few of the recommended fonts, but I have not been skillful

  body: "Honestly, I think I would simply go with Courier, no alterations\u2014the
    classic, not a modernized remake. It is just ugly enough to merit punk. If you
    notice the descender on the lowercase \"p\" you'll see that it becomes quite muddled.
    That's a good thing; it needs no alteration. And, the spacing of the letters are
    just discongruent enough that it won't look perfect. \r\n\r\nPart of the uniqueness
    of punk is that it doesn't try too hard. Cut n' paste and typewriters are not
    punk because they've been sanctified by the Punk Rawk Academy, they are merely
    accessible and easy methods. Style was\u2014at at least at one point\u2014a byproduct
    of the tools, not the other way around.\r\n\r\nAs a person who grew up in a punk
    scene, I abhor grunge fonts. I feel that if one wants to dirty up a font, then
    that person should do it by hand. Could you suggest to your client that they take
    all their print material and photocopy it to give it that extra edge? I realize
    that's a chore, but if you can sell them on the idea, I feel it would do your
    work (and most importantly their brand) justice.\r\n\r\n<strong>Have fun.</strong>"
