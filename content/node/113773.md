  bar?\r\nhttp://www.notonthehighstreet.com/\r\nThe ampersand is particularly distinctive,
  but unfamiliar to me. (As seen in 'prints & art')\r\n(Also slightly horrible kerning
  on 'valentine's' makes me wonder if it's some kind of bespoke adaptation?)"

    pretty convinced you could get pretty close using his '[[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Hurme_Design|Hurme
