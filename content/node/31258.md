  local newspapper, which I use a lot, so I need this in vectors.\r\n\r\nThe closest
  I could get was Bodoni Campanile or Bitstream Modern 725. Can anyone Id this?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\nAdriano"

    is a rather fine font. \r\nYet, I believe that to a large extent it misses the
    point of Didot fonts. Their beauty is in their dryness, some would say their haughtiness.
    They should look grand, not pretty. The curves introduced in the K and k don't
    really work, I think: they bring the characters back to calligraphy when the greatness
    of Didot fonts is that they go one step further than the Bodonis by departing
    even more from writing.\r\nAt least, this is what I like about them and I believe
    is their specificity. "

    \  don't use Ambroise for the word Marketing, and I wonder whether it is because
    they share my dislike for the k."

    from the second set of Marcellin-Legrand character from the Imprimerie Nationale
    is perhaps more convincing.

  body: The y is also rather fine. Not the version based on the u that appears on
    type design today but the version based on the v, which appears on the main page
    on Ambroise.
