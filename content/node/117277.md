  to be companion of <a href\"http://dstype.com/type_families/maga\">Maga</a> typeface
  (a serif typeface erlesed by DSType foundry).\r\n\r\nI'll be using this typeface
  on Light and Bold weights (light for running text and  big quotes and bold for main
  titles ) in a website I am creating at the moment .\r\nI will use the sans serif
  companion for the captions, figure caption, and sub-heads, as well as in bottoms
  and secondary text.\r\n\r\nI looking for something that is beautiful, readable,
  modern, and web friendly. \r\nSomething with the size, color and beuty of Rijks
  Museum <a href=\"http://www.boldmonday.com/en/rijksmuseum/\">custom typeface</a>.
  I know that they develop the typeface based on Penno, but Penno doesn't have the
  same qualities as in this one.\r\n\r\nGive me some hits guys\r\nThank you all\r\nF\xE1bio
  Santos"
