  body: 'Greetings everyone! <BR> <BR>Well, this is my first post here... Always liked
    typography, but just started learning to build fonts this last month... I&#39;m
    primarily self trained so I&#39;m definitely a rookie here and hope to learn alot.
    I usually work in CG/Pixel illustration. Anyways, enough with the introduction.
    Here&#39;s my first work for critique, and my second font ever:  <BR> <BR><img

    <BR> <BR>I hope you&#39;re not all tired of extremely small pixel fonts <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Critique away, please... '

  body: Lovely work John, I think the LC p could use some work... not that I know
    how, as there are no descenders. The &#34;g&#34; works just fine, it&#39;s just
    the &#34;p&#34; that strikes me as odd... <BR> <BR>Nice though. Lovely pixel art
    too!
