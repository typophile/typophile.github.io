  seem to have different versions: for example, ITC Bauhaus vs. ITC Bauhaus Std, or
  ITC Ronda Std, ITC Ronda Pro, or ITC Ronda Com. Even within ITC Bauhaus, there is
  one published by Adobe and another by Linotype. I'm not particularly sure what all
  of these mean, and I'd appreciate it one would address such differences!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "When ITC was a separate company, they licensed their trademarked font names
    and provided analog artwork to many different companies. Each one remaining into
    the modern era produced a slightly different digital version and new companies,
    like Adobe, added their own digital versions of these as well. \r\n\r\nAddressing
    the individual differences would take a few whiles, but in general, the core set
    of glyphs should match from vendor to vendor except perhaps for the scaling to
    the font to the em. And, glyphs like Euro, which were added after the original
    artwork was distributed, may not be consistent. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'The differences between Std, Pro and Com are usually in language support.
    Sometimes Pro fonts also incluse advances typographic features like smallcaps,
    alternates, swashes, etc. Check the glyphs tab in MyFonts to see the amount of
    glyphs. You also can see what features and character set each font as when you
    check tech specs, which can be found by clicking on one font: you then get a waterfall
    preview, with for tabs above it.'

    [[http://www.adobe.com/products/type/font-licensing/additional-license-rights.html|the
    list of additional license rights for Adobe fonts]], the ITC fonts are all listed
    as, \"1 : Licensed for print and preview embedding\" in a list of criteria that
