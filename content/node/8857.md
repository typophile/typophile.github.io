body: I would like to learn the basics of type design and I hope to design some typefaces
  of my own someday. I&#39;m trying to decide between the following books... <BR>
  <BR>- &#34;The Elements of Typographic Style&#34; by Robert Bringhurst <BR>- &#34;A
  Type Primer&#34; by John Kane <BR>- &#34;Type and Typograpy&#34; by Phil Baines
  and Andrew Haslam <BR> <BR>What would some of you recommend? I&#39;m thinking Bringhurst&#39;s
  book is the most thorough and comprehensive of the three...

  body: Bringhurst&#39;s &#34;Elements&#34; is widely viewed as the next best thing
    to a typographic bible - even by many of those who don&#39;t agree with everything
    in it. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Elements is indispensable in the overall, but if Ryan is going to choose <i>one</i>
    book to start, I wouldn&#39;t choose that. Something like Tracy&#39;s &#34;Letters
    of Credit&#34;, Young&#39;s &#34;Fonts &amp; Logos&#34;, maybe Cabarga&#39;s &#34;Bible&#34;
    or even Lawson&#39;s &#34;Anatomy&#34; should come first, I think. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Thanks for the replies. <BR> <BR>Elements does seem a bit daunting to me as
    a beginner, although I dont think it would hurt to add it to my library. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks for the recommondations HPH. I will most likely try to find one of
    those books, as I plan to start off with learning the basics and using FontLab
    itself.

  body: If your interest is specifically in type design, as opposed to designing with
    type, then I second Hrant&#39;s suggestion of Walter Tracy&#39;s <i>Letters of
    credit</i>, or Lawsons <i>Anatomy of a typeface</i> if you are looking for a more
    basic introduction. Bringhurst&#39;s <i>Elements...</i> is an excellent book,
    but most of it is concerned with the use of type rather than the making of type.

  body: This is probably overload for a beginner, but I uploaded the &#34;starter
    booklist&#34; we distribute to new MA TD students <a href="http://www.leonidas.org/html/MATD/resources/MATD_PrintResources.pdf"
    target="_blank">here</a>; it&#39;s a few pages long, so the really-recommended
    first twenty-one things to read are highlighted. &#40;PDF saved for Acrobat 5,
    so all should see the highlights&#41;.

  body: I just purchased Cabarga&#39;s &#34;Logo Fonts &amp; Lettering Bible&#34;
    and I must say that it looks perfect for me. I&#39;m excited to read it and learn
    some new tricks for creating my own fonts. <BR> <BR>I will keep my eye out for
    Tracy&#39;s book as well, thanks everybody.
