Toaplan creates the Zero Wing video game.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2.	Toaplan releases a port for the Sega Genesis console with the addition of an intro scene, which is then translated into english (very poorly) and released in the United States.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3.	Toaplan goes out of business.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4.	Someone from a Zany Video Game Quotes website notices the poor translation, and highlights the game.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5.	Overclocked.org does a humorous voiceover of the Zero Wing intro in a fake Wayne Newton voice.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6.	Dozens of game-related messageboards begin to post quotes from the parody, and images altered to show the phrase.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7.	Most of the threads lose interest and die off quickly as the trend is pronounced dead countless times.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8.	The Flash movie/video is released with images from the threads and music taken from the origional game someone had added the phrase &quot;all your base&quot; to.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9.	AYB explosively expands to the general (non game messageboard-reading) public.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10.	The origional site for the video is shut down within hours due to excessive traffic, and moves to PlanetStarsiege.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11.	Lycos ponders how &quot;All your Base&quot; was transformed from obscurity to a top 50 search practically overnight.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12.	Mainstream media begin to notice the trend, and stories appear in Time Magazine, USA Today, Fox News, The Los Angeles Times, Tech TV, Wired, and many others.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->13.	As the 'remix' used in the video goes from 58 hits a day to several thousand per day, mp3.com notices the track has been ripped directly from the video game and pulls the music off their site due to copyright violations. It is later returned unchanged.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->14.	The trend continues to grow as it expands into nearly every corner of the web.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->15.	Large websites like Angelfire and Hewlett Packard sneak &quot;all your base&quot; references into their designs.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->16.	&quot;All Your Base&quot; is pronounced dead several times every day, yet it's 15 minutes of fame continue for some reason&hellip;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

My kids learn grammar in a much more formal way than I ever did. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think we (in the 1970s) were expected to pick up the rules through osmosis, via exposure to correct English, rather than by actually being told what they were. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->am<!-- raw HTML omitted --> concerned about cultural imperialism (even within England, the language police have been, and continue to be, busy suppressing regional and class variations in speech and writing). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand, I think that where precision is important, it is necessary to be able to write exactly what you mean, and to expect others to be able to correctly read what you have written.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;&gt;Maybe we should rethink using words such as &quot;damage&quot; and &quot;proper&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yeah, agreed. That's sloppy on my part. Variation and innovation in language is of course inevitable. But variation/innovation can be beautiful and intelligent &ndash; when it makes its own kind of sense and/or grows out of a love and deep understanding of communication and language &ndash; or it can be just dumb, lazy mistakes that get to seem OK because they're repeated often enough by 'authoritative' sources. E.g. I really enjoy reading David Foster Wallace's stuff. He has an amazing ear for language. You find yourself eventually thinking the way he writes, which is very far from 'proper' usage a lot of the time (beginning sentences with 'And but' etc.). And regional vernaculars often have their own grammatical tics which make total sense within their contexts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But there is usage, I think, which is just plain wrong and ugly &ndash; generally usage which is trying to be transparent and authoritative but which falls over owing to lack of knowledge or skill on someone's part (either the writer, who can be excused, or the copyeditor, who can't). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->R <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

(Of course, the plays of Beckett and Pinter made the point a lot earlier.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clemmons was always complaining how he was mis-quoted by the sports press in Boston, so they decided to report his utterances verbatim, without the benefit of normal &quot;speech-to-text&quot; copy-editing, thereby making him come across as a complete neanderthal. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The point is not that normal people are &quot;morons&quot;, but that printed text has for a long time been mis-representing normal speech, and this is a correction.</div>
