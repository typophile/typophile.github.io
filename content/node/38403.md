  cannot find a typeshop that offers that version. Do you happen to know of a shop
  that does?\r\n\r\nOR if you can recommend a font in that style... I've been looking
  for quite a while and can't find one. It should be fit for (rather cheap) newspaper-print
  and have that sublety in not being too harsh and not being to snobby. I am aware
  that you might not find it like that at all. But if you apply those attributes to
  that font, maybe you will know what I am looking for.\r\n\r\nThank you and all the
  best."
