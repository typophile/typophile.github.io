    personal, Chester, it's just that where I <a href=\"http://www.aut.ac.nz\">work</a>
    Infinity is the corporate brand typeface, for reasons best known to our advertisers
    (maybe they wanted to join the space race too?). They have saddled us with a corporate
    template that allows for 12pt Infinity ST Medium to be force justified with no
    hyphenation over a 79mm line length with only 2pts of leading. Because Infinity
    sets pretty wide (as the name suggests?) and the university uses a lot of long
    words that don't break, it is all too easy to figure that a good face can be used
    very badly indeed.\r\n\r\nI hope it's treated much better in the the 'man and
    space' book elsac is working on... after all, it'll be used for display right?\r\n\r\nIncidentally

    interesting shapes and does the job. Pleased to hear that the local language got
    catered for at the outset.
