  of our community. and i'm fairly certain that the reason why was because of bigoted
  remarks on typophile. i've got a fairly tough skin and can ignore quite a bit of
  stupidity, but apparently some folks just wont stand for it. just another reason
  to watch what you say. please play nicely."

  body: "I'm sorry Paul I don't understand this post. What sort of bigoted remarks
    was this individual saying- racist, sexist, large foundries suck, anti-pc, anti-mac,
    hated the Chinese, hated digital, liked picking on newbies... what was it and
    how do you know?\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe the individual quit the Typophile forum. And
    who are the people that determine that an individual should be 'outta here'?\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: i saw this person recently and he said that he was avoiding the typophile
    boards since there was some anti-gay sentiment floating around. i was hoping it
    was just a cool-down, but not leaving a forwarding address looks pretty grim.

    that's all i can say as to <em>worse</em>.\r\n\r\n<em>Paul, you\u2019re being

    hope that that would mollify those who are offended.  \r\n\r\nAs I've said, I
    would like to see the moderators have a heavier hand, but moderating is voluntary--thank
    you Paul!!--it's probably not possible. \r\n\r\nI'm regularly put off by insults
    on Typophile--individual and group--but I've come to see that as unfortunately
    a practically unavoidable feature of the internet. "

  body: This is wrong. As moderators I think we need to be a little stronger with
    those who start to spout. The thread in question, I'm sure, had to be the one
    where the person was looking for a  "gay" typeface to go in the book. I'm sick
    that this has happened.
