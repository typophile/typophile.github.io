  body: Davy&#39;s Dingbats has something kind of like it... but you&#39;d have to
    play around with it in Illustrator. When I needed these &#40;called laurels I
    think&#41; I just scanned in the newspaper.

  body: Illustrator has leafs has a border. You could draw your path shape, apply
    the leaf border, expand and scale as needed.

  body: I have this crappy collection of ancient &#40;1995&#41; EPS clip art, and
    in it I found three laurels that you might like. Every once in a while this stupid
    thing comes in handy. <BR> <BR>The forum isn&#39;t letting me upload the EPS file
    &#40;or a PDF, for that matter&#41;. <a href="mailto:cheshire@cheshiredave.com">Email
    me directly</a> for it. Anyone else who wants it is welcome to it as well.
