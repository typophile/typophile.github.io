    Having also a look to the main logo \"JUNPITER\", I thought it could have been
    a (modified) [[http://fontfabric.com/category/free/|FontFabric font]]  (Nexa,
    Intro, Code, Solomon...) but none of them, even [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Fontfabric|their
    commercial releases]], match all specifications... [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/intro/|Intro]]
    is probably the closest I have from them but /I and /K are off.\r\nIf you have
    Gill Sans or Gotham on this computer, you'd rather go with Gill Sans, I guess
    it'd need less work to customize.\r\nI like also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mostardesign/sofia-pro/|Sofia]]
    (/V and /K off) and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/g-type/houschka-pro/|Houschka]]
    (/V off) which are very close.\r\nYour best chance would probably to ask directly
    to [[http://bravo-company.info/1023/about|Bravo Studio]]. And if they do, drop
    some lines here."

  body: "Agree. To me, Avenir is \"only\" (but very) close for \"FUTBOL\", some peeky
    differences still, to my eyes at least (or may be I'm not using the same version
    of Avenir): /F middle bar vertical position (lower on your sample), /B bowls connection
    contrast, /T width...\r\nLittera is also a fine catch for these two. "
