body: "I'm looking for a typeface I remember from a book of graphic headline sets.\r\nit
  was one of those books with the entire set printed out and you could scan them in
  and use them as bitmaps\r\nunfortunately, I don't have the book anymore, as it belonged
  to my former employer\r\n\r\nit was made out of eyeballs and bones and oozing guts
  and stuff, It was a fairly popular font back in the day, I'm thinking mid 80's the
  early 90's, it was only available in upper case\r\n\r\ncan anyone help me out?"
