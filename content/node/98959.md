  body: Maybe this isn't the greatest place to get web design critique, but I noticed
    issues with your logo right away. The /g colliding with the /d needs work. Kerning
    could use a little help too. I'm not crazy about the overly generic logomark either,
    but hey, it works for Altria and a thousand other pixel logos, so who knows.
