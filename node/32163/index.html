		<div class="commentbody">The chances are some smartarse blogger will mention goatse (if you are tempted to google this don't blame me for the consequences). I like the contrast of organic against the clean numeral, but for me the organic has to be either symmetrical or clearly not. I don’t find the type choice sympathetic to the business, maybe upper and lower case would work better, it would also help with the HTH and AY kerning. It is also worth mentioning the axiom of working up a logo so it can work in a single colour without the grads, which would actually fit in with the green nature of the business too.

		<div class="commentbody">For the most part, I like it. It says "spa" or "fitness centre" to me, and it looks like it's targeted to women (the '8' shape mirroring the curves of the female body). However, the colour choice bugs me. To me, yellow leaves represent dying plants, not healthy ones. Maybe use the deeper green for the plant and a lime green for the '8'.

The text is fine, but I agree with Tim.  It doesn't take away from the logo, but it doesn't add anything, either.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks guys, ill have another on up later today. I need to rework the middle flower so as no overlaps occur, and also figure out how to make it a B&W logo. Im not sure if just outlining the gradient parts with a thin stroke would work, or just look naff. 

We'll see
thanks again

		<div class="commentbody">In Illustrator and Photoshop, change the colour pallette to HSB and remove the Hue and Saturation values. This will give you a direct grayscale representation. 

All logo's should be designed in grayscale first imo, to establish a good contrast between the various elements, as well as possible background colours. After that it shouldn't be too hard to choose colours with a brightness similar to what you have in grayscale.

This is what I ended up with as a direct conversion:

		<div class="commentbody">I copy you on the greyscale, but dont most people also require or sort of want a solid simply black and white logo as well? I suppose in terms of reproduction and production greyscale works fine. . . I'm trying to figure out how to design it to be simply black and white and also allow for the obvious addition of colour.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, James, a black and white version is necessary.  Think photocopies, fax, newspaper classified ads, etc etc ... 

Maybe you can make it work by making the plant black (knocking out the edges from the 8) then simply outlining the lighter (gradient) areas of the 8.  

Or, perhaps keep all the 8 black and add a hairline to indicate the curves that divide it into the gradient areas.

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think it works in grayscale at all. The word DAY just recedes to the background.

I think you need to make the mark work in strict black and white with no reliance on the gradients you used in the original. I say this because they will probably require the logo to be executed in vinyl for use on the store window or front door. I would hate to have to plot, weed and lineup 3 colors of green just to execute the current logo in vinyl.

Leaving that concern aside, the mark still needs work. Your inner flower is off-center for no obvious reason, when the mark begs for symmetry. Also the flower looks like it was frankensteined from different dingbats. It would look better if it was more customized.

One last thing, the icon is way too big in relation to the text. I'm afraid that when reduced to fit on a business card, the text will be too small.</div>
