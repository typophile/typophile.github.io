    the !title portion of the tweet. Is it possible to make this so?

    Christopher Dean is one of the best contributors to the site and him working on
    interacting with the interface on one topic isn't spam. If he did it to excess,
    then sure. But that's not the case.\r\n\r\nGrumble on you surly old curmudgeon.
    I'm growing an affection for your playing the role of Oscar the grouch."

  body: '@ Jared: Your instructions re twitter great. Enough that someone like me
    can get it right the first time. I woke up this morning and noticed "buddy" features
    were also there. Not sure how new this is. I mucked about and it seems pretty
    self explanatory and I''m pretty sure I managed to get it working too. I did a
    few searches that came up with not. Are there instructions or a description of
    the buddy feature somewhere on the site that I may have overlooked?'

  body: "I like to think of it as treating everyone with the respect I'd hope they
    would offer me.\r\n\r\nAs for the Buddy List, think of this as a very \"Beta\"
    feature that we wanted to try out. In essence, you can add Buddies by clicking
    the link on their profile page. This allows you to track their activity in a more
    economical fashion.\r\n\r\nThe Flag feature is to empower all users to identify
    posts that require moderator attention. It goes into a central queue that the
    moderators will be watching. This is a more efficient way to manage the volume
    of content than the emails we get from time to time pointing out spammers in our
    midst. We'll be working to tuck the Flag link into the bottom right to keep it
    out of the way.\r\n\r\n"
