    technical aspects...

  body: When you look at Microsoft and Adobe fonts, please look at recent ones. That
    is, &#42;not&#42; Adobe Garamond Pro, Arial or Verdana. You can look at Frutiger
    Linotype &#40;that is free and comes with Microsoft Reader&#41; or Brioso Pro
    &#40;best as reference for glyph naming and encoding&#41;.  <BR>Adam

  body: there are some great articles on typography on microsoft&#39;s website. one
    that i thought would be applicable to your question is titled &#34;Character Design
    Standards&#34; &#40;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm</a>&#41;
    and gives some good information on the design of latin characters. hope you find
    this helpful
