body: "I just got back from this year\u2019s [[TYPO Berlin]], the <em>international</em>
  conference organized every year at [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt]] by [[FontShop]].
  TYPO Berlin may be Europe\u2019s largest graphic design conference, and its theme
  this year was <strong>change</strong>, perhaps because after 10 years, [[Erik Spiekermann]]
  had announced that this would be his last round as one of the organizers.\r\n\r\nUnlike
  2004, I spent this year working inside the [[Linotype Library]]\u2019s stand in
  the lobby. My whole review should be read with a grain of salt, as I only took time
  off from speaking with customers to see three of the lectures. \r\n\r\nFrom what
  I have heard, the real theme that ran throughout the conference\u2019s presentations
  what not <strong>change</strong>, but <strong>vacation pictures</strong>. It seems
  that designers do in fact <em>go on vacation</em>. Once there, they take photographs,
  usually of type or lettering. And sometimes, the cool pictures they will go on to
  influence great work and big projects; but not always. <small>We probably all do
  this.</small>\r\n\r\nIf I have any critique of the conference, it was its \u201Cinternational\u201D
  moniker. This may have been international as far as a designer conference goes,
  but it didn\u2019t seem so wide in scope. Even though visitors from a number of
  countries were in attendance, most seemed to be either from Germany, Austria, or
  Switzerland. Or they were Danes or Dutch who spoke German. The speakers\u2019 list
  was more geographically rounded out than previously, and credit must be given for
  that. This year, in addition to speakers from Germany, Holland, and the US, there
  was one speaker from Africa (Zimbabwe), one from South America (Brazil), and one
  from Asia (China, although she currently lives in Berlin).\r\n\r\nThe part of the
  conference that I most enjoyed was meeting the designers from [[Magma]], who had
  traveled from Karlsruhe. They seemed to have had some sort of symbiosis with Hewlett-Packard,
  at whose exhibition stand they spent the three days showing (you guessed it) vacation
  photos. Magma is a design studio that runs [[Slanted]]\u2014a German type blog\u2014and
  [[Volcano Type]], a small type foundry. These projects go along way toward creating
  and supporting real typographic dialogue within Germany, and it was good that their
  organizers were invited to speak.\r\n\r\nTYPO Berlin, save a few last minute changes
  to the schedule, was well organized\u2014especially the weather. Whoever it was
  at FontShop who played a role at <em>that</em> must definitely be commended, that
  was the biggest improvement over last year.  Attendance seemed slightly lower than
  in 2004, but I don\u2019t know the real figures, and in any case, the event was
  still well attended, especially by students. It is always good to see such a hefty
  percentage of students at conferences like these. They have the most to gain from
  large-scale design events, and FontShop\u2019s generous student pricing made their
  volume of attendance possible. \r\n\r\n\u2013\u2013\r\nThose of you who\u2019ve
  read this far deserve a treat. Here is one (non-TYPO Berlin) related goody: SoFake\u2019s
  <a href=\"http://www.wefail.com/twats/\">Top Ten Commandments</a> for dealing with
  clients. I got this link from David Linderman, a professor in Offenbach who is also
  from the United States, and currently living in Berlin. So true; take a look!\r\n"
