  body: I like that you're being creative with the symbols, but your copyright symbol
    has probably gone too far afield. Conceivably, a mark that doesn't quite fit the
    description of a C enclosed in a circle may leave the user open to arguments that
    the legal criteria have not been met for what constitutes a copyright notice.

  body: "Are the angles sharp enough to work for a Car company?  A french car company
    would be fine, but I would think a manufacturer from anywhere else would want
    sharper, stronger looking corners.\r\n\r\nI'd take a look at Klavika Condensed
    (GM's current font)\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/klavika/\r\n\r\n
    and Toyota's current font.\r\nhttp://www.fonts-download.net/fonts/tables/T/Toyota-MR2A_C_table.png\r\n\r\nAnother
    idea--since you're working with a car designer, you have a great opportunity to
    use line segments from the body work curves they have already designed.  Both
    type designers and car body designers essentially just create and shape curves..\r\n\r\nMy
    2 cents..."

  body: "That /g/ is just not reading for me at all. It looks like it was cut off
    in a printer error. Have you considered a complete, closed bowl? Maybe even a
    one-story /g/? I'd also suggest bringing in the flag on the /1/ a bit, probably
    in length but perhaps in weight, too. It's too heavy for me as of now.\r\n\r\nOther
    than that, it looks quite fun!"

  body: "That's what's called the Danish \"g\", and I personally think it fits quite
    well here. A controversial glyphs can actually help sell a face (Spiekermann has
    said as much about Meta's \"g\") as long as it doesn't destroy functionality -
    and this is no text face!  :-)\r\n\r\nMy only big gripe is the lc \"q\" - that
    one <em>is</em> too much!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I have noticed that Germans, Scandinavians, etc. tend to treat the letter
    Q as an O with a diacritic, since their languages don't really use it. For a bespoke
    font that isn't likely to spread to a global market, this might be a better choice
    than a normal "q" which may be mistaken for a "g" by such readers. It's quirky
    but still readable by English speakers, though I can't speak for q-rich languages
    like Spanish.

  body: "Personally, I like original cuts of |q| formed after the model of |Q|, but
    I've gotten negative feedback on that as well in the past...  I guess the world
    it not quite ready yet for this kind of revolution.  ;)\r\n\r\nI certainly like
    the |g|. The overall appearance of the font strikes me as rather loud (almost
    as if it were written in all-caps) and technical. Perhaps that's a desired quality
    for a car designer, though. What kind of cars are we talking about?"

  body: "I like it... I do wonder about that /3 though. It's middle join seems a little
    off. I'm not sure I would have chosen a Danish /g -- but if you do use it maybe
    make the thinning on it's loop (at the bottom) less apparent? The tail on that
    /q seems short.\r\n\r\nNitpicks aside, very nice! :-)"
