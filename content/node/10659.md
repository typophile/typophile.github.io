body: I&#39;m a veteran type designer &#40;early T-26 fonts&#41; wanting to explore
  OpenType for converting my older Type-1 fonts. I&#39;m intrigued by the FDK, but
  the worst part is installing it on my new 17&#34; FP iMac &#40;Jaguar&#41;.  All
  of Adobe&#39;s docs seem dated &#40;older python on OS9&#41; or just plain confusing.
  <BR> <BR>I can get MakeOTF.py &#40;-n&#41; to run from a command line, but I can&#39;t
  figure out where to locate the necessary files nor tell MakeOTF.py where to look
  for them. <BR> <BR>If anyone has any words of wisdom on how to get up and running,
  I&#39;d be forever grateful.
