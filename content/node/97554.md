  the same, just difference size, but I can't say I'm 100% sure.\r\nIf it's not, I'm
  looking for the name of the 2 fonts!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/untitled_5658.PNG]\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"

  body: "I think these are different fonts, as too many details (tail of y, or ear
    of g, for example) are different.\r\n\r\nI would use the [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]], but I don't have time to check, and I think more U.C. letters
    would be helpful.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
