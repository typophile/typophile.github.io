  week now and can't find it... I'm starting to think is not a font but a custom art
  instead...\r\n\r\nAt first looked like a easy one to find, but every possible match
  I've found had like one detail diferent of this one...\r\n\r\nDon't know if the
  File will indeed help much coz it's on low resolution but I appreciate any help
  you guys can give me!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nJohnny\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_needed_3438.jpg]"
