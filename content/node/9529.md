  body: That is true, Jim Parkinson did restore it, but is there a Font that it is
    based on or would Jim have created this from scratch? In perticular the Capital
    Z, N and H. I have not seen other BlackLetter fonts like it; not yet. Jim has
    the font Amador but it is not the same as this.

  body: I&#39;ve never seen a Z like that before either. The exact logo you&#39;ve
    posted is no doubt custom  lettered and not a font.  <BR> <BR>If you can find
    example of the masthead before the refinement you could see if the Z was part
    of the restoration. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s more than a couple of black letter experts
    around here, hopefully they can shed some more light.
