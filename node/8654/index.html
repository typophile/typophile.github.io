On the other hand, his figure of 500 conference attendees is off. Obviously it varies from year to year, but at the Rome conference, which he attended, there were only about 350 people. There was also a higher than usual number of freebies, reducing the overall revenue considerably. <BR> <BR>I don't completely disagree with Luc: ATypI does need to find ways to reduce operating costs, but I disagree that membership should be free.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There was plenty of planning, Hrant: the organisers planned for 500 paying attendees, a reasonable estimate based on previous years and the relative popularity of Rome as a destination. Only 350 people came to the conference, and a large number of those people did not pay. The organisers were left with a large number of books, and on the last day of the conference had to make a decision about what to do with them. It would have cost a lot of money to ship the books back to England, so it was decided to hand them out to the people still in attendance. I'm sorry Matha and other presenters who would have liked one of these copies were not in the lobby at the time. As you can imagine, during the conference the organisers had rather a lot to deal with, without having to figure out how to dispose of a couple of hundred extra books, tracking down individuals who might have wanted one, etc.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry, but I have to say it. <BR> <BR>With all the concern about ATypI's funds, it's absolutely shameful that the books weren't sold off at a reduced rate or, even better, autographed and auctioned off. I'm sure plenty of people would have bought one at a discount if they'd had the chance. <BR> <BR>If people find that giving them away/letting people run off with a whole box of them is the best solution, then I'm not surprised we're short of cash.  <BR> <BR>M.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Matha, you're suggesting solutions to something that wasn't a problem at the time of the proposals you put forward. <BR> <BR>The problem with the books was at the end of the conference: pile of books, no one around to give them to. Choice: throw them away, ship them back to the UK at some expense, give them to whoever was around at the time. <BR> <BR>Last option doesn't sound so bad to me. <BR> <BR>Perhaps someone should have done something about this before the end of the conference - but probably no one had a concern about it until they were packing up and found a pile of books. <BR> <BR>Likewise, no one was concerned about there being less people around than had be forecast for catering - because it just meant more food. <BR> <BR>It's a shame that the people who transported the books to Rome didn't make provisions to take any &quot;overs&quot; away, but that's just too bad at this stage. <BR> <BR>The auction wasn't a solution, because it had already happened at the stage this became a problem - and who's going to buy a copy of a book they already have!? Besides this - if there was time/will to do this then there could have been equal time/will to organise giving them away in a more equitable manner. <BR> <BR>I think, as they say, &quot;there's no point crying over spilt milk&quot; - especially as you neither spilt the milk nor were there to mop it up. <BR> <BR>If you want to complain about it I think you should complain to those who made the decision. <BR> <BR>I'm not defending the mess, but I think it's disengenuous to be offering solutions to a problem after the fact, and a long time after someone else made a decision, on the spot, about what should happen.</div>
