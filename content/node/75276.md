  wrote after WW1. I would like to use fonts that would give the spirit of that time...\r\n\r\nI
  need two fonts (serif/sans) but maybe rather three: for each chapter, I thought
  that the beginning could use three fonts for title, content and the formula \"Introduction/Chapter
  1/Chapter 2/etc.\"\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about (bodoni/futura)  (urw antiqua
  / urw grotesk)    (berthold walbaum / berthold Akzidenz Grotesk)?\r\n\r\nCould the
  third font (for \"Introduction/Chapter 1/Chapter 2\") be \"Bauhaus\"?\r\n\r\nI made
  some attempts but I am not very happy with the result? Maybe the design of the the
  first page of each chapter (I mean the page with three different things: \"Chapter
  X\", Title, beginning of the content) could help but I am not very good for that;
  could you help me with some nice ideas? Regards."

    Kabel (named after the new  transatlantic communications cable), based on remarkably
    similar letter shapes.

  body: "@lordk: Where do your study and who is your supervisor? \r\n\r\nCan you provide
    us with more information about the content, such as who the philosopher is, what
    he wrote about, significant dates, his birth and death &c? When selecting a typeface,
    this sort information is very helpful to the typographer.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a
    somewhat more playful display face for a \"Chapter 1\" page is very cute, and
    a great opportunity to provide a little visual interest. Not sure about Bauhaus
    however. For myself, it has very strong associations to the school then to post
    German WW1 philosophers. Semantically, I would consider it inappropriate. \r\n\r\nIf
    I think German and War (I'm a Canadian) The first font that pops in to my head
    is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fette_Fraktur\">Fette Fraktur</a>, specifically
    for it's dagger-like lowercase p, which would be on every chapter page (<a href=\"http://www.searchfreefonts.com/free/luftwaffe.htm\">Luftwaffe</a>
    is similar). However, some people look at it as being associated with Nazi Germany,
    which is an area you may wish to avoid.\r\n\r\nIf you could work in a nice display
    face for your chapter pages, then perhaps you could simply focus on a pair of
    serif and sans that work well together and not concern yourself with making them
    look of the time as you have already done that with your display face.\r\n\r\nBodoni
    and Futura make a nice pair due to their contrast, but Bodoni is a a little hard
    to read at small sizes unless it's set exceptionally. Nick should be able to shed
    some light on setting Bodoni. I have never had much success with it.\r\n\r\nAdditional
    pairs include:\r\n\r\nSyntax/Minion (or Garamond)\r\nFrutiger/Meridene (or Frutiger
    Serif)\r\nUnivers/Utopia\r\nGill Sans/Perpetua\r\nRotis Sans/Rotis Serif\r\n\r\nThere
    are others, and several threads that discuss this here, but I do not have them
    ready to mind."

    I\u2019m a bit sceptical about Koch Antiqua\u2019s performance in longer texts.\r\nWalbaum
    and Akzidenz Grotesk could be a good choice, too. Also have a look at Storm\u2019s
    Walbaum Text: http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/index.php?id=52\r\nIt
    would also work with FF Bau,, which is a revival of Schelter Grotesk (even older
    than Akzidenz Grotesk and used a lot in the early 20th century, and in particular
    by bauhaus designers).\r\nAnother possibility is Venus Grotesk.\r\nProbably one
    of the best known expressionist typefaces is Neuland, also by Rudolf Koch. It
    could be used for short headlines (it\u2019s upper case only and also kind of
    related to Koch Antiqua and Kabel).\r\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t use the \u2018Bauhaus\u2019
    font since it\u2019s a 70s typeface, loosely based on experimental Bauhaus typefaces.
    It would be anachronistic in a post-WWI context."

    for my titles/subtitles; it is very much in the spirit of my question. I am not
    sure however Koch Antiqua could be used for the whole text; what other serif could
    be used with Kabel?\r\n\r\nThe author is Franz Rosenzweig; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Rosenzweig.\r\n\r\nEngel
    Stabenschrift is very nice too; I have to see if I could use it WITH Kabel (for
    instance: \"Chapter 1\" in engel-stabenschrift,  \"My big title\" in Kabel, and
    my text with a serif one) or if I use it RATHER THAN Kabel. I may post here a

    have the words "Chapter 1" in Berthold Berliner Grotesk Medium, my titles and

    the period of the author I am studying quite well.\r\n\r\nMy idea was to add some
    more \"graphical\" fonts for the titles of the chapters only, but maybe you are
    still right for that also. I probably have already much to do with Akzidenz Grotesk
    and Walbaum... Maybe I should rather find some nice design with these two families
    than add some external family: as you can see I play a little with the size of
    the number of the chapter (I don't know if it is acceptable in a thesis, but I
    would like to make something original)."

    when they are scaled to tiny sizes. These claims are also backed up by focus reports
    and legibility tests. Also to say that there is no such thing as \"objective typography\"
    is pretty naive, there are without a doubt certain styles that apply more so to
    certain fields. \r\n\r\nPersonally I believe we guide our decisions to an extent
    with objective purposes in mind, and then allow the subjective conclusions select
    typefaces and so-on. \r\n\r\nYour statement \"Default design offers the illusion,

    a little ironic though, especially considering that when believing in an absolute

    work to well because there are too many typefaces and styles combined that don't
    go too well together, and create an unfocused and messy result. I would ditch
    ITC Kabel, as this is not accurate for the time, if you want to use Kabel use
    the original version. As there were a lot of styles and fashions going on in that
    timeframe, with quite different ideals and objectives, I think it would be wrong
    to try to bring them all together, as it will probably be quite wishy-washy. If
    you want to go period style, find the style that is accurate, it could be bauhaus
    inspired, geometric, expressionistic, grotesk, classical.... Look at period pieces,
    and try to find out what defines it. I'm not saying it's the way to go, but if
    you want to go in that direction, it's important to be accurate."

    several fonts from these two families (Akzidenz Grotesk Extra Bold for the number
