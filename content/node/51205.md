body: "I'm doing a website for a large event-booking organization. Their existing
  design assets have a slick and urban feel and their audience is young adults on
  the east coast. Their logo is set in Futura currently, but elsewhere on the site
  they need large headers with a bit more pizazz. The organization provides entertainment
  for plenty of weddings, but it didn't feel right when I tried something scripty/formal.
  \r\n\r\nI'd like to find a typeface that is \"fun\" and speaks to the nightlife
  they offer: DJs, parties, bands, comedians. Any suggestions would be great! "

  body: It may depend on the specific music genre, but in general [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=4|House's
    Chalet family]] works well for many of these situations. It's not too far removed
    from Futura, but much more glamorous and feminine which goes over well with the
    wedding business.
