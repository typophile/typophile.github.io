  body: "Thanks, looks like you're right. And if so, very heavily modified. The triangular
    brackets on the serifs have been converted to curved fillets, in addition to the
    other mods. And instead of modifying just the characters needed for the logo,
    apparently the entire alphabet was modified and made into an actual font for use
    on the subheads shown at the elonphoenix.com home page. A lot of work. Thanks
    again.\r\n"
