  body: Probably. With that bug, I guess I&#39;d be concerned about having legal values
    for PostScript FontName, glyph names, and maybe PostScript FullName. Was there
    something in particular you were wondering about? <BR> <BR>T

  body: thanks for your advise, after fontlab chrashed couple of times while generating
    especially this font. i decided to test it on an other osx system and it works
    there. <BR>i still dont know what the problem is, but it seems that it only accours
    on my system. in this case i give up searching for a solution. <BR>i&#39;m still
    intrested in any document or website that shows me possible postscript failures
    caused by fonts.
