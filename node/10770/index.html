The ink'll be tackier and, I think, give you a better impression.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Try placing the block face up, rolling out a thin layer of ink on a peice of plexiglass or lexan, inking up the block, placing the paper on top of it, and burnishing it with the back of a wooden spoon (er, make-shift baren). It's the white trash way of ancient Japanese woodblock printing.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You could also try using a &quot;galley&quot; or &quot;proof&quot; press if there's one laying around the shop.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Good luck. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nathan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant's definitely right that galley proofs aren't worth a heck of a lot. For that matter, my trailer-park-Hokusai method isn't going to be absolutely stellar. If you're planning on archiving these things <!-- raw HTML omitted -->digitally<!-- raw HTML omitted --> though - i.e., if you just want something to trace a vector image of - I think that either one would be OK. If you really want to archive them on paper though, you might want to fire up a small platen press if there's one available. If you're not that familiar with letterpress, I think it'd be easier to get decent prints off a platen (e.g., C&amp;P) than a flatbed (e.g., Vandercook).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nate</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. Inking up, printing, and cleaning hundreds of blocks would definitely take an inordinate amount of time. The advantage of a proof press is that it's pretty simple. Just a flat bed that your galley (or block in this case) sits on, and 2 rollers that you pull over the paper. Essentially like block printing but with rollers instead of a baren. Faster than a hand baren, but with uglier results.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To be honest, if you're not looking for top quality prints, learning how to lock up a few blocks at a time in an old platen press wouldn't be too hard. It's pretty easy to pull a print - pretty darn hard to pull a good one. I'm no Gerald Lange, but if you're interested I could email you some pointers.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Incidentally, below is a pretty standard proofing press.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Are better prints pulled from  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the latter?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lord almighty, yes. Proofing presses, traditionally, are used for pulling proofs of &quot;galleys.&quot; A galley is a tray that a typeset page would sit in, after being composed, before being printed.

		<div class="commentbody">smc <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sounds like a project. I'd say Nathan has guided you well here. The best blocks to reproduce would be any with a copper face. These would be older than zinc or magnesium faced blocks and would repro much better as their detail is much finer. Rubber stamping won't do unless you are just using it for identification purposes. The use of a traditional hand buren is difficult and the spoon technique is probably worse than rubberstamping.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The galley proof press could work well if you are somewhat skilled with a brayer. A lot of these galley proofers are Vandercooks (Model O). But they are not the sophisiticated models that come with registration and inking mechanisms.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Best would be a Vandercook equipped with these (any of the Universal or SP models are the top of the line), as these were specifically designed for exacting reproduction work. At the end of the commercial letterpress era, these were used by type shops to repro metal type for the photo offset folks. We did a lot of repros for folks intent on digitizing these faces at one time. We even did a couple of repros for Doyald Young's first book. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Most likely, in that shop you are messing around in there is a platen jobber, as in Nathan's last photo. (Nice looking press by the way.) This would do the job as well, but the reproduction quality would not be near what you could get with a properly adjusted Vandercook repro press. The platen jobbers are quite beatific to work on but I think it a bit easier to learn on a Vandercook as the makeready and inking concerns are less formidable to a beginner. The Vandercook is also better for bookwork, if for no other reason than it has a relatively massive bed size. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Best to take a workshop on letterpress before you engage in this project. The blocks themselves are becoming quite valuable, especially the copper faced. A search for letterpress items over at eBay would give you an idea of their relative value. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FYI: I've got a group site on contemporary letterpress practices at <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PPLetterpress">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PPLetterpress</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald Lange <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Bieler Press  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
