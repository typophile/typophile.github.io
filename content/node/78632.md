body: I will be in Mumbai from March 13 through the morning of March 18. Tourism information
  about Mumbai is fairly limited and focuses on stuff outside of the city. What great
  stuff should I make sure to see that would fall under the categories of art and
  design? Do typographers in Mumbai do pizza dinners (or whatever the local nerds
  eat in Mumbai)? And are there going to be any good art and design events that I
  should attend? FYI, I do not speak any of the Indian languages other than English.

  body: Six days means at least 4, perhaps as many as 7 religious days. I'd pay close
    attention to those as, if you are lucky, you'll see people doing things you will
    not see elsewhere.

    India is also home to Muslims and Sikhs as well.

    looking forward to that. New York\u2019s vegetable selection in winter is just
    dreadful. "
