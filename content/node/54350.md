  I can probably traced it out, but i was hoping to buy the font.\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated.\r\nPat[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_3523.jpg]"

  body: The R is so very close to Futura... The other letterforms are so geometric
    (the bowl of the C and G look like a perfect circle) that I would guess it's been
    hand drawn.

    very well be custom."

    hand-drawn.\r\nIt's like a in-between Futura and Mostra 2 (Straight Letter \"G\").\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/mostra/\r\n\r\nBtw,
    thanks for the reply guys... "
