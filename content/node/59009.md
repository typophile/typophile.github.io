body: "<em>The New York Times Magazine</em> unveiled a redesign today. Aside from
  the magazine being \"9 percent smaller -- a little off the top, a little off the
  sides\" (as the editor wrote in his letter that doesn't seem to be online), there
  is a brand new type palette at work. \"This week we are introducing a new typeface,
  <a href=http://carvalho-bernau.com/retailfonts/lyon/>Lyon Text</a>, that was designed
  by Kai Bernau and Christian Schwartz and will be used exclusively by the magazine.
  It is more condensed than our previous typeface -- with the result that the words-per-page
  tally has hardly been affected. Perhaps if we hadn't mentioned it, you would hardly
  know the difference.... We are introducing new display-type faces -- <a href=http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013>Knockout</a>
  (by the studio Hoefler & Frere-Jones) and Nyte (by the Portuguese designer <a href=http://www.dstype.com/>Dino
  dos Santos</a>) ...\"\r\n\r\nThese three are joined by <a href=http://typophile.com/node/6774>Stymie</a>
  and Process Type's <a href=http://www.processtypefoundry.com/custom/sunday.html>Sunday</a>
  from the previous design.\r\n\r\nScans below. Check out the link to Lyon Text above
  for more information and samples.\r\n\r\n<strong>Page with Knockout, Nyte, Lyon

  body: '"What you are sure to have noticed is our new design. When we were told last
    winter that our dimensions were being downsized, we took a cue from Rahm Emanuel
    -- we muttered lots of words we aren''t allowed to print, then saw how our ''crisis''
    might present an opportunity: a redesign. The magazine''s look had not changed
    much during this decade, and for at least one good reason: We have annually won
    a raft of design awards, including the 2007 magazine-of-the-year-award from the
    Society of Publication Designers. But every object can use a bit of refurbishing
    now and then, and that is what our art director, Arem Duplessis, and his staff
    have done -- they''ve given the magazine a cleaner, more modern feel without changing
    who we are and what we do."'
