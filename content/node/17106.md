  etc.) over satellite photographs. The examples I've seen either have the type set
  in yellow or outlined in a contrasting colour. Neither of these methods seem particularly
  fantastic to me, so I'd appreciate any ideas for methods and/or typefaces.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRichard"

  body: "Stephen, below is (hopefully) an example image. Most of the annotations I
    need to show are points rather than areas, so 'Empire State Building' rather than
    'Manhattan'.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ny.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks Simon
    that (and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/iraq/images/alfurat_lrg.jpg\"
    target=\"_blank\">this</a>) is exactly the kind of thing I'd like to avoid."

    working with dark, low-contrast images so white type will work just fine. Avoid
    drop shadows, boxes or outlines. (Forgive me, I don't know where the Empire State
    Building is.)"

  body: It's farther uptown...but yeah sorta midway between where Stephen has pointed
    and Central Park (the big green blob in the middle of Manhattan). Closer to the
    white line than to the halfway point though.

  body: If the images are low contrast black and white like Jared's I'd say go with
    the black on yellow, as it definitely jumps out at you in an acceptable manner.
    Yet, if the images are as you originally posted, Richard then I would go with
    white as yellow is too closely related color-wise to the blue/green combo you
    have in your posted photo.
