  I ran this sample through a couple of other font ID sites with no matches yet.\r\n\r\nThe
  story behind this font, in case it helps in any way:\r\n\r\nMy boss had me redo
  a set of business cards for a number of new recruits, but he doesn't have the originals,
  so I'm tasked with recreating them from scratch.  I scanned his card in and re-arranged
  the numbers so as to not reveal addresses/phone numbers.\r\n\r\nThe curious thing
  is that all the alphabetical letters were done in Century Gothic, but the numbers
  were done in this unknown font, and thus I only have the numbers as a sample.\r\n\r\nThe
  closest match I've found so far is Courier, but differences are still there.\r\n\r\nAny
  insights are much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\nRyan"

    maybe the alphas were this, and not CG?

  body: "hopefully you aren't trying to match the texture. that's just dots from the
    printing process. looks like the text sample you have was printed at oh, maybe
    80% instead of 100% black. \r\n\r\nand i still want to know where the name came
    from, relative to naming a font like that. made me giggle after reading a blog
    about farts in yoga class."
