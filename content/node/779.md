body: This font isn&#39;t exactly the most original or exciting typeface ever; I&#39;m
  mainly working on it for fun. I wanted to create an &#34;industrial&#34; face and
  somehow or other it ended up shadowed. <BR> <BR>While I love the proportions of
  the font, I am very dissatisfied in how the diagonal strokes&#39; shadows ended
  up. <BR> <BR>Is there anything I can do without ruining the perspective? I thought
  of widening the diagonals&#39; shadows so they were the same width as the horizontal
  and vertical strokes&#39; shadows, but I wondered if that might not look odd...
  suggestions? <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1354.jpg"
