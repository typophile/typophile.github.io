  much everything I know about this item is in the picture. It was used by GM on cars
  in the 70's.  Says \"Printed in Canada 8/70\" at the bottom.  The GENERAL MOTORS
  at the top is a different font than the rest, but I think the rest of the text is
  probably/possibly the same font, just some bold and some plain.  \r\n\r\nCould sure
  use some help!  Twentieth Century MT is close, but not quite right."

    variations of Futura. plus your sample is predigital so the exact version may
    not even exist.\r\n\r\nthat said, maybe i'm wrong altogether!"
