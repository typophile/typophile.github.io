body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/foto_3660.JPG]\r\n\r\nI've found the top
  text \"RinzemA\" already; it's Dolphin.\r\n\r\nThe bottom text, \"Meubelmaker &
  Restaurateur\" is still unclear to me. \r\n\r\nIt is a logo that has to be vectorized
  for a customer.  \r\nThe customer and neither me know anything about the font. I've
  tried sites like whatthefont.\r\n\r\n(The photo is scanned, and I only have an business
  card with the logo on it wich is even smaller)\r\n\r\n\r\nHelp me out please!"
