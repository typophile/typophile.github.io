body: "I posted this in the Sans Serif forums a couple of days ago, but only had 3
  responses so far (thanks Ill Sans and Coop). So I thought I might have better luck
  here, especially as this is a logotype.\r\n\r\nHere is a logotype we are working
  on for an architect. This client does really nice work, very simple and sharp but
  with some bits of beautiful ornament. I have thought of it like the photos of the
  opening of Mies\u2019 Barcelona Pavilinion: an iconically simple structure inhabited
  by a bunch of guys in top hats and women with fur collars. Hope that means something
  to some one out there.\r\nMy design idea therefore is to create a mix font - Helvetica
  Neue Ultra Light representing style and simplicity, American Typewriter representing
  a sort of ornament, VAG Rounded representing a smart but friendly attitude, and
  semi serifs (The Mix or Rotis Semi) representing technological ornament. Sounds
  like a lot, right?\r\nThe actual aprocess has been to modify Hel to create this
  mix, taking selective cues from each of the previous.\r\nSo, just looking for general
  comment and tips to refine this. I am confident in the design and really like it
  generally.\r\nPlease be aware that I love Helvetica, tight letterspacing, Swiss-style
  simplicty and all those other things that you might hate! Our client shares my general
  design disposition.\r\nThis is my first post, so thanks for taking it easy on me!\r\n\r\nYou
  may be interested to know that my colleague, user name Univers, has also posted
  an architect's logotype here recently. These projects are not related in any way."

  body: "I think you either need to shorten the tail of the a and make the t's wider,
    adjusting the a would allow you to close up the ar space and, tight spacing or
    not, the ec is too tight compared with the other characters. Amending the t could
    also take the form of moving the crossbar further to the right. The punctuation
    seems like it could be shorter and I don't really understand the need for a full
    stop at the end of the logo.\r\nTim"
