    to tell people to answer your IDs in the indicated thread.\r\nFor future, please

  body: "Could be wrong but, even if many fonts and vector letterings have shown up
    recently (a trend actually), this one could have been based on [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Futura/fonts/|Futura]]
    (/O, pointy /N or /W)\r\nSome in the same trend: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/diamonds/|Diamonds]],
    [[http://26plus-zeichen.de/en/fonts/tj-evolette-a/|Evolette A]], many ones at
    [[http://www.tendollarfonts.com/|TenDollarFonts]] (TWOFACED, Echelon, Rathe, Parqa,
    Fonecian, Finding 57, Harf 77, Labieno, Positano, Marina, Alumia...)\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    after further inspection, I guess I was actually wrong, could be Evolette."
