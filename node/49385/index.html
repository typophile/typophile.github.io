Here are [[Hebrew]] Type Design specimens from Mr. Raphael Frank's important little book on Hebrew type designs and its history, printed originally in German, and translated later into Hebrew. An English translation doesn't yet exist. His ideas and opinions are quoted in my English language book on Hebrew Typography.

Frank's contribution to Hebrew type design was significant and influenced Jewish culture due to its enormous impact upon modern Jewish and Israeli societies. These samples include rarely used examples of different type style designs, demonstrating his intense love and knowledge of Hebrew type design.

Frank designed and created the popular standard FrankReuhl type style. No other type design has been used to a greater extent for the Hebrew language in the twentieth century and beyond. In the eighteenth and nineteeth centuries, the Merubaas typeface, and its derivatives, were the book publishing stand typeface. Since then, it was replaced by FrankReuhl. Over the past fifty years, Hadasa, David, and Narkiss, have attempted to upsupt FrankReuhl's dominance and have failed.</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">[img:sites/default/files/old-images/meruba_5199.jpg]



The first type specimen is called "Meruba", which means in Hebrew, square. This is not the common name associated for this design. 

Why then did Frank refer to this design as "Meruba"?

"Meruba" is both a very old and yet also a relatively recent design. Many hand-drawn books from hundreds of years ago appear with this typeface design, usually to present Biblical material.

Relatively recently, the huge Romm family printing establishments in Vilna, Lithuania standardized their print jobs upon a version of this typeface design. Their popular printing of the Talmud for over a hundred years used it. Hundreds of other Torah books, including those of great Chassidic masters, used it. And even hundreds of non-Torah books of literature, poetry, Hebrew grammar, children's primers, and secular thought, used it as well.

There are two reasons why this design style is referred to as "Merubah", or square.

First, the dimensions of the design is very wide and square-like. This is conducive to accurate reading, good comprehension, and overall clarity.  

Also, the design in some ways is comparable to the type design of the style used in the Sefer Torah scroll. In fact, many laws are derived from aspects of the "Merubah" design that would invalidate the Sefer Torah scroll style of lettering.

The second reason is actually associated with all non-script Hebrew type designs, and not necessarily to the "Merubah" design. Here, the choice of the word "Merubah" simply means "block letter".

It is unlikely that Frank refered to this design because of the second reason. Clearly, the first reason accurately describes the most important aspect of the "Merubah" design, and seems to be the basis of Frank's intention.

		<div class="commentbody">Nevertheless, Frank revolutionized the Hebrew printing industry with his new bold FrankReuhl design.


[img:sites/default/files/old-images/franksamp_4236.jpg]



Here are two examples of the popular standard Hebrew design, created by Frank.

The top one, in regular and bold weights, is the most like the original design, with certain differences. A radical change was introduced by Varityper, a now extinct photo-typestting firm, later purchased by Agfa(-Compugraphic). 

The type design was later revived for desktop publishing as an early Hebrew PostScript font by FontWorld, the leader in software products for professional typesetting of non-Latin laguages, such as Arabic and Hebrew. 

Recently, an early pioneer in desktop publishing software for foriegn languages, Linquists' Software, created an OpenType version for use in Biblical Publishing of a scholarly nature, in Micrsoft Word for Windows. It was incompatible with Adobe InDesign CS/3 ME.

Another example popular in Hebrew desktop publishing is Apple's New Pnimim, another knock-off of FrankReuhl. New Pnimim is based upon (Merganthaler-)Linotype's version of FrankReuhl. It contained many design differencs, depending upon the needs of metal type, which were varied besad upon the point size used.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">If we look carefully at these two designs, we can ask, what is different about them to cause such an upheaval in the Jewish printing industry?

First, the proportions are very different. The "Romm" design is much wider than Frank's. This means, practically speaking, many more words per line typeset using FrankReuhl will fit in a given space. This is very economical to printers.

On the other hand, Romm is very wide, almost squarish. The letters are thicker. The results are much more conducive to repeated study.

A sofer, Hebrew scribe, once explained the advantage of the Romm typeface. "It has round soft edges," he said. "I know what it means to look at letters for a long time. The design of this typeface is easy on the eyes. You can look at it forever, and yours never feel strain."

Romm was designed for Bible and Talmud study, and the like. The prayerbook is typset in Romm. The Passover Hagada is typeset in Romm.

When Frank lived, the Jewish world was abandoning traditional Jewish study, and going away from use of books typeset in Romm. Frank's design fit a gap, a need in Jewish society, that was different, and reformed of tradition. We see today that most secular literatures, newspapers, even pornographic writing use FrankReuhl.

This has been the norm for over fifty years.

The question is, with a revival called desktop publish, and a new font format excellantly geared for Biblical Hebrew, called OpenType, will the Romm design regain its status of dominance, particularly if multiple weights and widths of it appear to meet the needs of Jewish publishers today.</div>

Based on my own efforts to understand readability of roman text types, my guess would be that the ratio between counter and spacing is better in Frank Reuhl than in the older, wider styles, and that a better 'rhythm' resulted in higher readability in extended text.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Another very popular modern Hebrew design is Mr. Henri Friedlender's Hadasa, named after the printing school where he worked. Hadasa was created to be carved into stone on a new Israeli building. Friedlaeder resourched its design extensively, patterning it after motifs he took from very old Ashkenazic and Sephardic letter forms, and those of Bomberg and Soncino.

GoHebrew's Henri is a faithful rendition of Hadasa, approved by Mr. Friedlander before he died. Another version was drawn for the Israeli distributor of Esselte/Letraset products. Very recently, a third design was designed by FontBit, called New Hadasa. Also, John Hudson's Adobe Hebrew was inspired in part by Hadasa.

The very popular ArtScroll Orthodox Jewish publishing house based in Brooklyn uses Hadasa exclusively for its books. Mr. Friedlaender cried when he learned that the Bible today is studied by millions of Jews in Hadasa.

Although not as popular as David, Hadasa is a close third.

This is true. 

To peruse text swiftly, comprehension is certained enhanced. Perhaps, that is the main reason for its popularity and longevity.

The wide Romm design nevertheless is preferred for lengthy concentrated study. Rabbi Akiva Eiger zatzal even strongly endorsed the Romm family efforts to produce the Talmud over the previous publishers of Slovita, causing a decade long batter over which publisher has exclusive rights.

Rabbi Eiger cited that study would enhanced with this typeface, and for that reason it was justified to replace the publishers of Slavita.

Today, new renditions of the Talmud are being produced, with the effort of Oz VeHadar leading the pact, followed by Zundel Berman Books. A third effort is being made by the Moznayim/Vagshall publishing house, for this very large market. 

A fourth competitor is GoHebrew, whose near-identical version of the Romm and Rashi typefaces seeks to invoke Rabbi Eiger's ruling and capture the entire market.

The goal of GoHebrew is to remake the entire library of Jewish classics, with an English translation, too.</div>

Where's the head of this thread? What is subject? When you start a new thread try to take a little break; maybe drink... tea... coffee or something :)  There're ton of images  —  try to group them to one or two; rest a little bit, post more. 

Because right now this thread is a big mish mash.  Moreover, try to play a fair game. Why  do you say  knock-off and not  version?  — "MasterFont created, Raanana, as yet another knock-off of David"? Maybe FontWorld created knock-off? 

So, what is the subject? FrankReuhl ? Aharoni? Romm? text vs. display?  text vs. display vs. decorative? 



> Many Israeli newspapers use Aharoni for their headlines

I have here Israeli newspapers -- I don't remember the last time that I saw Aharoni. 

> Hadasa was created to be carved into stone on a new Israeli building. Friedlaeder resourched its design extensively, patterning it after motifs he took from very old Ashkenazic and Sephardic letter forms, and those of Bomberg and Soncino.

Are you aware of Friedlaender's  essay (appeared first in 1967, in German; 1975, Jerusalem) -- The Making of Hadassah Hebrew?  He was influenced  by  the Scroll of Esther (1800; Ashkenazic letter forms) and by the  Italian semi-cursive  Drugulin (also Ashkenazic letter forms). There's nothing about Bomberg or Soncino.

His first experiment was in 1932; 1941 first draft;  from 1932 to 1950 he was in Holland; From 1950 to 1970 he was head of Hadassah Apprentice School of Printing in Jerusalem. 

So,  "Hadasa was created to be carved into stone on a new Israeli building"?   In 1932 he knew that?  I didn't know that Friedlaender has encountered the supernatural powers :)

		<div class="commentbody">William,

Henri Friedlander was a very old man when I worked with him. He was retired. I spoke to him only on the phone. Out of respect, I never called him by his first name, nor did ever even refer to himself, by his first name or last.

I remember 3 things in particular:
a) He cried when I mentioned that much of Orthodox world was studying Tanach, the Bible, in his Hadasa typeface;
this caused him great satisfaction to know this. (We spoke in Hebrew, so he was apparently unaware of ArtScroll.)
b) He approved my interpretation of Hadasa as authentic;
c) He criticized one detail in a few letters, urged me to correct them, and added this was the secret of good Hebrew fonts.

The story how we spoke on the telephone was really amazing. I had just married and created a PostScript version of his Hadasa design for a very early system of Apple Macintosh operating system, when the IBM PC just began. It was System 5.

Anticipating to license it to Apple Israel, I sent Mr. Friedlaender a check for 100 old shekels. He return the check to me, explaning that he sold the rights to a now-defunct small European type foundry many many years ago. Hence, he was not entitled to any money. I was very impressed with his honesty.

Not long after, Mr. Friedlaender called me in Kfar Chabad. He said that "I noticed from the address that you live Kfar Chabad. Kfar Chabad is village which is inhabited with the followers of the Lubavitcher Rebbe." I replied, praised his work, extolled his important role in Jewish history, and added that the ArtScroll Orthodox publishing house in the United States had standardized their books on Hadasa. Then, I told him that even the Tanach, the Bible, appeared in Hadasa, and studied every day by many many Jews around the world."

Mr. Friedlaender was silent, and I heard him weeping like a baby.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David,

What a hostile post.

The theme of this thread is Hebrew Type Designs, like its name. The first post begins with Mr. Raphael Frank a"h, desiugner of FranReuhl.

FrankReuhl is the first main topic. To appreciate its position as the premiere Hebrew typeface design, I compare it to the Merubah typeface design. Merubah means square.
This design was popularized in many other forms, particular by the Romm family of Vilna, Lithuania. 

The Romm family printing establishments were reknown for very high quality workmanship. Even though they were very modern Jews, Chassidic masters sought for their books to be produced by the Widow and Brothers Romm.

In order of popularity, I move on to David, Hadasa and the rest.

I am glad that you add important details about Aharoni and Hadasa. I was unaware of this. In Israel, during the eighties, many popular Israeli newspapers used Aharoni for headlines, and Aharoni Tzar, its narrow look-a-like, for headlines of minor articles.

I don't read Hebrew, except to pray or study, or read fascinating articles about Hebrew Type Design. Perhaps, another black typeface design is used, like Chaim Shamen, Fat Chaim.

I would be interested to read, as I am sure many others, for you to post a summary of Friedlaender's article in German, and an overview of facts that you know.

He sold the Hadasa design I think to the Amsterdam Typefoundry.

In Israel, I read that he used the Hadasa design to be carved in an Israeli building. The book even included his picture, the building, and a picture of the short inscription. I never said that he made it for that purpose.

How is Drogolin in any way similar to Hadasa? Look, I have samples above. When I first saw Drogolin, I thought it was an attempt to capture the flair of Romm/Vilna. FontWorld called Drogolin by th name of Belz, because the Belz logo featured Drogolin. 

Actually, the font called Margoliot is not really Drogolin. Drogolin had a peculian curl on the lower left side of the aleph, and this version cuts it out.

David, you are a treasurechest of knowledge Hebrew type design. Please don't keep it to yourself. Share your knowledge with us, and post, post, post...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David voiced his objection to the subjective use of the term "knock-off". A knock off is an imitation of a popular design, simply with a different name, to avoid payment to its designer or copyright/trademark owner.

He cited the example of Tzvika Rosenberg, a popular Israeli font-maker, of MasterFont, who created Apple's Raanana. I called it a "knock-off". The bold version is a really poor knock-off.

I called it a knock-off because when it was first created and licensed to Apple Israel, the unrelated name, Raanana, a small city in Israel, was picked to avoid payment to Mr. Itamar David, in the early eighties.

David wondered why I did not call FontWorld's version, King David, also a knock-off, like Tzvika's Raanana. It's a valid question.

First, King David is not a "knock-off". It is a very carefully rendition, inspired by Mr. David's popular design. It is rendered not to divert from hiis designintentions, but to correct his design flaws.

The real differance is in appearance. 

Raanana is a little, thinner, narrower, and not equally weighted in its strokes. Look at how David is different. Its strokes are weighted equally, making reproduction at even small point sizes looking right, while the same text, at the same point sizes, does not look right.

King David captures David's flow, but adds a unique touch, like raising a bit the height of the lamed, or raising the top of the left hand lower stem of the gimmel to increase its clarity and legibility, or the lowering of the top of the detached stroke on left hand side of the kuf, to allow better distinction and "breathing room".

FontWorld never issued Itamar David a"h any royalty out of "moral good sense" in the nineties, as it had no way to contact him (he was an invalid either living in an age hold or with a child in America). If anyone knows how to contact his descendants, please write to: ContactInfoforDavid@gmail.com</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ittai Tamari -- Digitization of Hebrew Fonts (pp.190-191, p.195), about Frank-Rühl:

"Among its numerous faults one may mention its too dense and heavy appearance, which needs very careful letterspacing when hand-set in sizes smaller than 12 point...clear distinctions between similar-looking letters (Daleth and Resh, Vav and Za'in, Heth and Thaf) were not made, although the designer was well aware of the problem.
However, what interests us most is not the shortcomings of the design -- rather, its incomparable success as the most-used Hebrew type....Any possible explanation is indeed a mixture of many factors: sociological, technical, human -- and most of all the lack of other, more compatible choices, which would comply with the current taste. The Frank-Rühl letters appaered (at first only in normal weight, the additional bold weight was a later adaption by other designers), fortunately, in a significant period for the Jews: the establishment of the Zionist movment...; the visualisation of their return to the Promised Land....; Jewish authors and poets were endeavouring to write in the future only in Hebrew. These developments needed, of course, means of publications, i.e. text typefaces, which needed to be different-looking from the then familiar ones. These were found in the Frank-Rühl design." 


Line #1: the original -- Berthold
Line#2: Linotype linecasting machine
Line#3: Monotype

Right now there's not  a single revival that is close to the original. 

> Why then did Frank refer to this design as “Meruba”?

Meruba= block letter, all non-script Hebrew type (page 9, 12 -- his little booklet). BTW, Monotype's version of Meruba was called Sonzino, Drugulin's was called Magalith; the font Miriam -- Frank also may have designed Miriam, since it appers in the 1924 Berthold catalog along with Frank-Rühl.

		<div class="commentbody">> Right now there’s not a single revival that is close to the original.

I also think this conclusion is accurate. Considering the specimens that we have before us from his book, which are for large size body text, we actually don't have cpmparables.

Apparently, Frank made his design to typeset large Biblical texts, or Hadagas. The other venders aim were rabbinic commentaries, or political discussions, or literature in general, that appears at smaller text sizes, or even have very small footnotes.

There are multiple weights which I have from Linotype, 9, 10, and 12 point sizes. Vaityper's version is even lighter, and very suitable for small text sizes. We don't find a 18 pt. or 24 pt. FrankReuhl from Linotype.

Each one (the 9, 10, and 12 point sizes of Linotype's FrankReuhl) is very different from its siblings. 9 in particulars has major differences. 

I also has from a very old job a revival of FrankReuhl from an artist commissioned to draw very large letters from an unknown machine. There also an interesting design that is unique to all other versions of FrankReuhl from other venders, except one of the 3 point sizes from Linotype (the nine) [maybe, it was drawn from the nine].

I also have another set of drawings that I was told was drawn from an old Linotype machine, where Frankruehl is somewhat crossed in design with Romm. I haven't revived it yet.

In these two versions (Linotype's 9, and the very large drawings) the bottom of the right side is lifted off (in part) from the baseline. It looks like a person standing upon his toes, with his heel lifted off the ground.

I debated whether I should include this detail. A professor at RIT (Rochester Istitute of Technology, a leader om printing technology and type design studies) suggested that this peculiarity in design was like the design of serifs, to allow ink to gather during the print process. He reasoned that sonce this was no longer an issye, I should abandon thos aspect of the design.

I was unsure, so I left it in the Varityper revival. Later, I found ot only in the small 9 point aleph of FrankReuhl from Linotype.

Perhaps, the professor was correct, but his conclusion in my view was not. What do you think?

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Israel, I got hold of a Biblical grammar book, so I understand better now what David has been saying with regard to your idea of 'automating' the setting of the kamatz ketan and shva na, as you discussed in the other thread. This thread seems to be 'live', so I'll post here. 

The grammar book is by a Chinese guy, but it corresponds exactly to what David was writing, so I'm assuming it's solid. It's called "Grammar for Biblical Hebrew" by C.L. Seow. 

So the rule for the kamatz katan--which he calls a kamatz chataf--is simple: if it's in a closed syllable, then the kamatz is a kamatz katan, and otherwise not. This David wrote, and followed the rule with a 'smiley'. 

Now I understand the 'smiley', because the rule leads you into a whole chain of questions. 

How do you know whether it's an closed syllable? Simple, it ends with a consonant that has a schva nach under it, or is the last letter.

And how do you know whether it's a schva nach or schva na? Well, now you get a bunch of rules, one of which is that it's a schva na if comes after a letter with a strong dagesh.

So how do you know whether it's a strong or weak dagesh? Well, one of the rules is that it's a strong dagesh if it's preceded by a short vowel. 

So how do you know whether it's a short or long vowel?  

Well up till now I will probably forget all this, but a computer won't, so there's no problem programming it, I would guess. 

But here is the kicker: you only tell whether it's a short or long vowel by whether it falls on an accented syllable. 

So you've hit a brick wall if you are only looking at syntax, because nothing in the letters or nikud are going to tell you where accent is. (David mentioned the accent issue also.)

To know the where accent is you are going to have to have a 'look up' of the word in some kind of dictionary that will tell you where the accent lies. 

So it looks to me like what you need is not open type programming to do what you want, but rather some kind of 'spell check' that will automatically put the kind of nikkud you want. That you could do with the look-ups. I know that one of the Hebrew typing programs already has 'auto-nikud', but I don't know whether they will distinguish a kamatz katan and the different kinds of schva. But I don't see why they couldn't do it in principle.

So with a kind of spell checker which you would run or would be active all the time, it seems you could do what you want. But not by just sticking to the sequence of letters. 

ps. Oops I left out that the cantillation marks for Torah writings--taamei hamikra--might change where the accent is, according to what David wrote. That might force you to look at more than on word, but presumably a spell check program could do that in principle. 

Whether it's worth the effort is another question. 

pps. This book says that a kamatz katan is sometimes indicated by putting a meteg next to the kamatz. That seems to me typographically better than the line above the letter, or a bigger kamatz. However, I read somewhere that in the Siddur the meteg multiplied like measles so nobody really knows what they mean. So I don't know. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, 

Thank you very much for the detailed explanation about Mr. C.L. Seow's printed observation s on Biblical grammar. Where did you pick it up?

It seems kinda dire for programming it onto OpenType, as OT needs to substitute a string of characters, and there seems no Unicode value for stressed and unstressed (I thought that is the role of the meyeg in nikkud but not taamei mikra text).

Effort is not the issue. In OpenType programming, you do it once for the first and you never have to do it again.

I still like a visual indicator above the letter for a shvana.

My remaining question is the seeming preplanned design for the upper graphic symbol for shvana, because every occurance of shvana never had an upper taam. That seems to indicate that the lower taamim can cause a shvana but the upper taamim are immune to them. Why?

The answer is that upper and lower taamim must have a connection not only to cantillation but to grammar as well.</div>

Some 15 years ago, a paperbound book called Hebrew Typography was authored by Mr. Itamar David, with lots of designs that he made, including a few for the Hebrew Bible, including matching taamei mikra There no information in it at all. Just lots and lots of specimens. It looked like he knew his end was near, and wanted someone to implement his designs. Maybe, that person willo be you or me. 

I haven't seen it for many years. I know I have it somewhere. When I find it, I'll post some scans. Each design is very different that the other.

Why do you think that a graphic symbol besides the shva to indicate a shvana is preferable to a graphic symbol above a Hebrew letter, like in the Kehot Publication Society books (floating asterisk), or in the books of Shay Lemorah publishers (a floating asterisk with a circle closely around it)?

Perhaps, Tzvika had a different set of original artwork than I, as you the weights and metrics of both the book and bold are different.

A meteg as part of the taamim/cantilation set, true.

It is also a part of the nikkud/vowel set.

I don't lein, chant the Torah according to the taamei mikra (even though I do sing some made-up verses in the shower). Does a meteg represent a sound in the taamei-mikra?

In the nikkud/vowel set, it is a stress mark, indicating which syllable in the word is stressed. Is this how it is used in Tanach?

So, too, a shvana. It is universal, applicable in both text without taamei-mikra and text with taamei-mikra (even though I have only seen it used in text with only nikkud, and not in text with taamei-mikra [except in Rabbi Shmuel Winefeld's Shay LeMorah Tanach books]).

		<div class="commentbody">Re. meteg, in vocalisation and in cantillation:

The small vertical mark serves two functions with two names: meteg and siluq. Meteg is a vocalisation mark used to indicate secondary stress. Siluq is a cantillation mark signifying the end of a Biblical verse. Since the marks are visually identical but semantically distinguishable by context, Unicode unifies their encoding as a single mark.

It is the nature of chant -- not only Jewish chant but also Byzantine chant and the varieties of Latin chant -- that melody arises out of text. This means that it isn't really possible to talk about cantillation independent of vocalisation; so, for instance, the marking of secondary stress using meteg has a musical function that derives from the musical function of syllable stress as a punctuating and rhythmic principle. Or, as Joshua R. Jacobson puts it: 'Where there are too many consecutive unaccented syllables, the rhythm of the chant may sound rushed. Accordingly, to slow down the pace of the reading, a secondary stress is often indicated on words with more than two syllables.... A syllable with a meteg should be chanted <em>slightly</em> louder and longer than a syllable that has no accent at all.'

Jacobson's book, <em>Chanting the Hebrew Bible,</em> is excellent, and I learned more from it about vocalisation and cantillation than from any grammar I have consulted (and I have grammars dating back to 1539!)</div>

Thank you.

Are some of yout very old grammar books in Hebrew by the Jewish grammar scholars of Spain, known as the Rishonim, the early dutactors of Jewish law?

A definition of shvana, kamatz katan, and hataf kamatz katan, is there. I believe Rabbi Shmuel Winefeld derived his information from there.</div>

This is very questional. 

Are you confusing it with sof pasuk? 

A meteg and sof pasuk has similar designs. Meteg though is small, like a nikud. Sof pasuk is much taller, does not descend below the base line, but does protrude above the other letters, like a lamed.

> Since the marks are visually identical but semantically distinguishable by context, Unicode unifies their encoding as a single mark.

If so, meteg and sof pasuk should have two distinct Unicode values. They appear together in a single verse.

Accoording to your definition of metrg, how then is a secondary stress indicated?

		<div class="commentbody">The grammar of Biblical Hebrew by Seow that Bill mentioned is a very good basic text. It manages to be a lot clearer than many other textbooks.

Genesius' Hebrew Grammar remains extremely important, despite being well over a hundred years old now. I still refer to it when I want a really thorough explication of a topic.

Some of the older grammars have lovely woodcut or engraved alphabets to illustrate pronunciation of the letters. I have my eye on one of these as a source for a possible display typeface. And then there's this beautiful piece of writing inside the back cover of my copy of Happellio's <em>Lingua Sanctae Canones grammatici</em> (1561). The larger letters are about 3mm tall, and the small letters only 1.5mm.

		<div class="commentbody"><em>Are you confusing it with sof pasuk?</em>

No. One of the ways you can distinguish siluq from meteg is that siluq will always be followed by a sof pasuq. Siluq always occurs on the last word of a verse, so if you see what looks like a meteg on the last word, it will actually be a siluq unless there is another accent. [There are a few cases of polysyllabic words that have both a meteg and a siluq; the latter, of course, is the one nearest to the end of the word.] The siluq is specifically a cantillation mark: it indicates a melodic ending to be sung.

<em>Accoording to your definition of meteg, how then is a secondary stress indicated?</em>

By a meteg. In the cantillation system, the meteg is used to indicate secondary stress. Primary stress is indicated by one of the other accents -- which one depends on the melody --, but where a number of unaccented syllables follow in succession, the meteg is used to signify a secondary stress, which musically is a rhythmic device.

[Note that I only know about Biblical Hebrew. I don't know how stress works in normal spoken Hebrew or understand what role meteg plays in the vocalisation system other than in cantillated text.]

Again, I strongly, strongly recommend Jacobson's book. It comes with an audio CD, so you can hear the correct interpretation of the different 'trops'.</div>

Because of the nature of chant -- all chant, not just Jewish --, there is a strong relationship of music to text and hence to the characteristics of spoken language, particularly stress, which performs a rhythmic role in both speech and chant. So yes, there is a relationship between the ta'amim and the nikudot, <em>but</em> -- and this is important -- vowels are the most fluid elements of language. They are fluid in their individual and regional interpretation and they are also historically fluid (consider the 'great vowel shift' in mediaeval English). So what the nikudot signify is something less fixed than either the consonant letters or the ta'amim. Note also that what the ta'amim signify is also changeable, although in a different way: how particular accents are interpreted by the cantor depends on the calendar, the same mark will be expressed musically in different ways depending on the text and the holy day. Historically, the ta'amim have also been given different melodies in different diaspora communities. Jacobson has a nice example of the intersection of these phenomena on page 16, where he shows six different melodic interpretations of the ta'am tevir -- respectively for Torah, Haftarah, Esther, Lamentations, the Song of Songs, and Torah on a High Holiday -- in a Lithuanian tradition.

Stam is as acronym foe three kinds of holy objects, the S-efer Torah parchment, Tefillin, and Mezuzah. That is why this design for religious writings.


> Ashkenazic

Now, do you see why I suggested (based on my research) when we worked on FrankRuehl and then Henri that the Romm design of Vilna, Lithuania, was based upon a Sephardic style of writing, and Adobe Hebrew, Henri (Hadasa), Koren (Crown), was based upon an Ashkenazic style of writing.



[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Alephs_3771.jpg]



.
Each of the alephs have a left upper arm facing leftwards.

Henri right lower leg, and Adobe Hebrew's, face to the right (in this, they blend traditions). Do you remember that I said that Hadasa inspired Adobe Hebrew?</div>

What do you know about the difference between the upper and lower ta'amim? Why are some above, and some below?

I checked in the Shay Lemorah Tanach to see if any shvanas bump into upper ta'amim. A shvana never appeared when there was an upper taan. That means, the ta'amim are related to the rules of Hebrew grammar.

I don't see yet how, but there must be a relationship between the taamim, the nikkud, Hebrew grammar, and maybe even the taggim in the Sefer Torah scroll.

Now, if Hebrew words are spelled according to roots, and modifiers, based upon Hebrew grammar rules. So, if Hebrew grannar is related to nikkud and to ta'amim, then they are related to the letters.

Did you find any book discussing this?

Good suggestion. JTS (Conservative central yeshiva) library in upper Manhattan has everything.

Do you know how JTS? Before there was such a thing as Conservative (such a inappropriate name), there were only Orthodox and Reform rabbis. A convention of them was held in Philly. Some Reform rabbis thought it would be amusing to have non-kosher food, like pork, served at the main dinner. The Orthodox rabbis were outraged and stormed out. Maybe that really the intention. 

In protest, they fonded JTS as a showcase central yeshiva with a tremendous library of every rare title you can imagine. The Reform in response founded Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati with its even greater library.

The Schneersohn/Lubavitch collection is as sizey. None of them are lending libraries. They do allow copies to be made.

John,

Does SBL-Hebrew have a double meteg by itself, a double meteg with each nikkud, a double meteg with each taam, anda double meteg with each nikkud and combination?

This is accurate if the word is a verb, but when it wasn't a verb, then it was an ordinary shva. So the definition needs an exception.

That can't be easily programmed in OpenType unless CSUB supports wildcard strings, since there are certain letters in certain places for verbs, and other places for nouns. Hence, if OT CSUB supports wildcard strings, it can be defined.

John,is that possible?

I am convinced it's doable, but my research learning curve is like a big mountain to climb.

The Lubavitcher Rebbe explains the statement in Avot, yagata umatzata, not as a halevai statement, but as a promise. He points out the lashon matzata is beyond relationship to the yegia. Plus the Rebbe Reshab says in Ayin Beis by the concept of hashaara (conceiving in your whether or not it possible) that everything is then possible if one conceives it. A profound concept. I bet Obama wished thay he believe he could be president.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While you are listing sources on the grammar of the te'amim and nikud, I see that the Encyclopedia Judaica has a long article, amounting to a small book, on this, under the heading 'Masorah'. It looks very exhaustive--and to me exhausting! It has a huge Bibliography. (It is in vol. 16, the final one, out of order.)

There they talk about the Ga'yah, which seems to later be called the meteg. Apparently it was initially created in order to distinguish the schva nach and schva na! And then it came to be used in all kinds of capricious ways, which scholars tried to sort out and systematize. 

Israel, according to Michael Meyer's history "Response to Modernity", the infamous "trefa banquet", with shellfish (not pork) was ordered by by laymen from a Jewish caterer--who obviously didn't know or didn't care about kashrut. It was not a deliberate provocation by some rabbis, but rather a huge embarrassment. Some Reform minded Rabbis indeed didn't care about kashrut, but they wouldn't have deliberately offended their colleagues. Still the laxness did reveal dramatically the underlying differences of attitude. 

The occasion was the first ordination of Rabbis from the Hebrew Union College, in 1883. At that time there were no separate Jewish denominations in the US, and indeed this did spark the actual split between Reform and Conservative, though the tensions were obviously already there.

An image. or two.  There's no such a thing — if it's a verb - yes; not a verb -- ordinary shva. 


> But is “it” referring to the kind of meteg which indicates stress....

There are ten different kinds of metegs:  
1. Heavy meteg: 2 kinds of heavy -- regular + not regular
2. light meteg
3. meteg on guttural 
4. meteg on middle  guttural 
5. meteg on sheva 
6. vayehi meteg
7. meteg +  letter he  
8. meteg on closed syllable + long vowel
9. meteg on open syllable +  long vowel
10. meteg +  similar letters

There's a rare meteg (Poetical Books)  that we don't know why that meteg is there.

As a  visual graphic (only Breuer and his school): there's the "long  meteg" — a long vertical line; " short  meteg  — the usual short vertical line.


In general, as a type designer you don't need/have to know the whole big family  so called meteg. But if you want to deal with grammar you have to.


To add to your "research learning curve is like a big mountain to climb": you want to have a special mark e.g. floating asterisk above the sheva na, right? But EVERY  hataf is sheva na:  hataf segol, hataf patah, hataf qamats.</div>

As I said, it's all in a very long Encyclopedia Judaica article, with extensive bibliography.

The author is identified as Aron Dotan, who was at the time of publication (1972) a professor of Hebrew Philology at Tel Aviv University. 

I'm afraid that if you want to study Hebrew grammar, you are not going to find sources that are kosher by your standards. The study of Hebrew grammar was developed largely by maskilim--Enlightenment Jews who rejected the Kabbala as nonsense.  

On the chronology of the split, I'd have to check. Hebrew Union College was set up as a seminary for all rabbis, with the goal of keeping the Jewish community unified--hence the name. Of course, that didn't happen. I think the formal separation into three branches--orthodox, conservative, reform--happened only after the trefa banquet. You have to remember that at the time there were relatively few Jews of any kind in the US.

About Cincinnati, IIRC, at the time it had the same Jewish population as New York City, and was a center of Reform Jews transplanted from Germany. The big influx of European Jews to the US only happened after 1880.  </div>

> To add to your “research learning curve is like a big mountain to climb”: you want to have a special mark e.g. floating asterisk above the sheva na, right? But EVERY hataf is sheva na: hataf segol, hataf patah, hataf qamats.

I am a very pragmatic businessperson in matters of type design. A graphic symbol over a letter with a shva to indicate to the reader is an accepted practice by two of the largest Jewish publishers in the world. So I want my fonts to support it.

A graphic symbol over a letter with a hataf katan, hataf patach, and hataf segol, is not an accepted practice by any Jewish publishers. So I could care less, of the hataf part is a shvana or just a couple of dots...

This is primarily a business decision.

I am a professional with very high standards, so I want to become an expert in Hebrew grammar. I am also a thinker of lofty concepts, so I seek to understand how letters, nikkud, taamim, taggim, music are interrelated.

About William's warning about the maskilim who excelled in Hebrew grammar, my role model is the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe. When he was a young boy, his parents hired secular tutors to teach him mathematics, Hebrew grammar, and other topics not studied in yeshiva. I am interested though in reviewing these same rules in the writings of the Rishonim (the early redactors of Jewish law), as I understand that all rules are derived from their writings.

		<div class="commentbody">Israel,

<em>A meteg is not chanted, but indicates a stressed syllable. In Biblical text, is the meteg indicating this?</em>

It is chanted <em>and</em> it is indicating (secondary) stress. Stress is part of chant.

What I am not sure about is how this chant stress -- and hence this use of meteg -- relates to stress in spoken Hebrew.


<em>How does the reader know its a meteg or a silug, if they occurs at the end of a verse? All they both repeated?

Does SBL-Hebrew have a double meteg by itself, a double meteg with each nikkud, a double meteg with each taam, anda double meteg with each nikkud and combination?</em>

There is no situation in the Bible text where meteg and siluq fall on the same <em>syllable</em>. There are cases where they fall on the same word, but always on separate syllables. So there is no need for a 'double meteg' combination.

Think of is this way:

The cantor is studying the vocalised and accented text (obviously he needs to do this prior to the service, because the synagogue scrolls do not contain the nikudot or ta'amim; he has to practice ahead of time and do it from memory). He sees this little vertical mark which he knows has particular musical significance. In the midst of a verse it indicates secondary stress, which he will sing slightly louder and longer than a syllable that has no accent. At the end of a verse it indicates a final cadence, typically of two or three notes depending on the word. [Note also that the cadence for siluq varies when the verse is the final one in the reading.]

So the terms meteg and siluq do not refer to distinct marks, per se, but to different interpretations of the same mark in different contexts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some additional observations from Jacobson's _Chanting the Hebrew Bible_ (p.430)

<em>• The symbols for meteg and siluk look identical.

• Siluk marks the last word in a verse. In most books it is followed by the sof-pasuk sign.

• Siluk is placed under the first letter of the stressed syllable.

• Meteg is a secondary accent: it will never appear alone on a word without that word's primary accent. The primary accent is placed on the stressed syllable. Meteg indicates a secondary word stress, usually two syllables before the primary stress.</em>

Jacobson provides examples of both meteg and siluq.

From these rules it follows that:

if you see a word with only the meteg/siluq mark, and no other ta'am, then it must be siluq;

if you see a word with the meteg/siluq mark on one syllable but another accent on a later syllable, then it must be meteg;

siluq is the sign used as a primary accent;

ergo, if a word has two occurences of the sign then the first must be meteg and the second must be siluq.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Further research on meteg confirms that its origin is as part of the full accentuation (cantillation) of the Hebrew Bible, and its primary role must be understood as part of that overall system. However, it is unique among the accents in that it is also sometimes encountered in otherwise unaccented text, i.e. alongside the nikudot vocalisation.

I'm only familiar with the Biblical text, so I don't know how meteg is used independently of the full cantillation system, and have not been able to locate reliable information on this (other than anecdotal comments that it represents 'stress', which doesn't really convey much: what kind of stress? in what circumstances?). What I am fairly sure of though is that this use is a later development and, presumably, derivative of the role of meteg in the cantillation system (as described above).

Here, for reference, is Gesenius' explication of the meteg accent (2nd English edition, based on 28th German edition, Oxford 1910). German readers may wish to seek out Baer's 'exhaustive account' cited in the footnote on page 64.

Yes, I am aware of that. But the 'Stam Regular' image you uploaded is a typeface and, despite the name, it seems contravene some of the rules of construction. Is it not a font in a style reminiscent of STaM, rather than an implementation of the Vaad Mishmereth STaM rules? It evokes the style of the STaM letters, but it does not follow them, if you will excuse the pun, 'religiously'.</div>

John,

I was addressing this issue  — along with other grammar-cantillation- biblical hebrew issues  — not long ago. My solution was very simple; especially if we're dealing with young students: to talk about prononciation with melody & prononciation without melody. Since, for example, meteg has no melody. 
They understand that 'to chant' is 'to sing', singsong, so how do you sing without melody?

We don't use the meteg in spoken Hebrew.

How does one sing without melody? The answer to that depends on how one defines melody. If one assumes melody to include changes in tone, i.e. pitch variation, and not just changes in duration (rhythm), then such 'singing without melody' would be what is called recto tono in Latin chant. This is a very simple style of chant that is rythmic but does not involve pitch variation; it is used for e.g. the liturgical confiteor (confession) and certain prayers, and can also be used, as a fallback, if one isn't accomplished enough to sing the proper melody for e.g. an antiphon.

Jacobson's description of the interpretation of meteg in Jewish chant indicates that the reciting tone is maintained: the syllable with meteg is lengthened and sung slightly louder, but the pitch does not change. So the role of meteg is rhythmic rather than melodic in the sense used in the previous paragraph.

There is a much more general definition of melody, though: 'interacting patterns of changing events occurring in time.' And in that case merely rhythmic changes could be interpreted as 'melody', although I wonder how many lay-listeners would consider the results melodic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">More on meteg and siluq:

With the assistant of colleagues at Libronix, makers of Bible study software and members of the SBL Font Foundation, I can provide this list of instances of single words in the Hebrew Bible text containing both meteg and siluq. In all cases, these are the final words in the cited verses (a necessary condition for siluq; see above); the first ֽ mark in each word is a meteg and the second is siluq.

The list is divided into two parts: cases in which both meteg and siluq occur on a single word, and cases in which they occur on two words conjoined by maqqef (the hyphen-like mark) with the meteg on the first word and the siluq on the second. When two words are conjoined by maqqef, the rules of accentuation are applied as if they were one word.

> Yes, I am aware of that. But the ’Stam Regular’ image you uploaded is a typeface and, despite the name, it seems contravene some of the rules of construction. Is it not a font in a style reminiscent of STaM, rather than an implementation of the Vaad Mishmereth STaM rules? It evokes the style of the STaM letters, but it does not follow them, if you will excuse the pun, ’religiously’.

Please enlighten me.

I admit that I placed little attention on the sample that you uploaded which I translated for you, in comparison to the sample which I uploaded.

Clearly, you spot significant differences between them. One is "reminiscent of STaM", while one is merely a font, "an implementation of the Vaad Mishmereth STaM rules; it evokes the style of the STaM letters, but it does not follow them."

I don't understand or even see your distinction. Please explain.

Are you referring to a totally different typeface design, known as: "Sefer Torah Sans Script"? I implemented it without the taggim, as I was instructed by the Chief Rabbi of Crown Heights, Brooklyn. He feared that the font would be misused, and suggested this alternative.

The font, "STaM", which I uploaded earlier is not used to write an actual Sefer Torah scroll, Tefillin, or Mezuzah. Rather, religious writings about Torah topics or actual Tanach texts are typesey using this font style.

But the image I uploaded is not a typeface at all: it is handwritten, which was my point in saying that it would make more sense to say that the Stam Regular type you showed is in the style of the earlier writing, rather than the other way around.

The second point is that the Stam Regular font, despite the name, is not actual STaM lettering: i.e. '<em>not</em> an implementation of the Vaad Mishmereth STaM rules'. It is a style of letter that has associations with religious texts, and hence can be used to evoke these associations, but the shapes of the letters differ from those of real STaM. Hence I find the name of the typeface confusing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John,

I know that your sample is handwriting, and both my recent samples are from font software. 

One of my samples is just like that which is used by sofer STaM, a Hebrew scribe of STaM, to compose by quill a Sefer Torah parchment (which is later sewed together), 5 parchments for Tefillin, and one small parchment for a Mezuzah. This is a font, without the taggim, the ornaments on top of some the letters. The scribe hand draws the letters according to different rules. the Vaad Mishmereth STaM rules are actually very old. Maimonides discussed then as well. Halacha authorities debate how to both correctly draw certain letters and at the same time incorporate ideas discussed in Jewish mystical writing, to evoke these ideas while wearing the Tefillin.

I do not understand your repeated reference to the Vaad Mishmereth STaM rules. They pertain to the Sefer Torah Scroll Sans letter shapes, but with the taggim. These rules do not pertain to the font called, "Stam".

I agree that the sample handwriting is not Stam. Rather, it resembles the typeface called Stam, but preceded it by many hundreds of years (?) .

Do you have other samples of old Hebrew handwriting?

The other one of my samples is the Stam font, used as a typesetting font by some people for some religious writings. There is no rule here to follow. The religious writings could be in FrankReuhl or Henri.

Stam was simply selected as a name, as you say, to evoke a religious feeling. Nowadays, few typesetters use Stam at all.

Yes, that is exactly my point: the typeface called 'Stam' does not contain the shapes of letters that I associate with that word. I am saying that I think it was a bad choice of name.

<em>Do you have other samples of old Hebrew handwriting?</em>

I have a lot of reproductions of Hebrew writing in my palaeography books (mostly mediaeval but also some very early examples, about which I will probably post some thoughts later in another thread).

I agree. But what can we do now, as people think of that style as Stam.

I am interested in the letter forns from a designer's view point, and also the content from a religious Jew's point of view. 

The earlier sample that you posted revealed a person who praised G-d for attracting youth with His will and input of two types of people: both those knowledgeable and those with "understanding".

Was he himself a youth who appreciated what G-d did for him?

		<div class="commentbody">David, I don't think you misunderstood Hrant's question. But perhaps for clarity we should talk in terms of left-slant and right-slant rather than forward- and back-slant, since the latter terms are relative and the former are absolute. For further clarity, left-slant is defined as having the top of a stroke being to the left of the bottom \, and right-slant as having the top to the right of the bottom /.

So Hrant was asking about right-slanted letters in Hebrew, and wondering whether Hebrew readers mind this.

As I understand it, there remains some debate about the 'correct' direction of slant for Hebrew 'italics'. I seem to recall that Zvi Narkiss decided that the letters should slant to the left. I see that Masterfont offer a number of families with options, i.e. secondary fonts with left- and right-slant, so that users can select which they prefer (but presumably one is treated is default 'italic' style and associated with the italic text function in apps).

Personally, I never use Hebrew 'italics', but if I were to I think the decision about slant direction would depend on a number of factors. When asked to make italic versions of Adobe Hebrew -- primarily for technical reasons -- I decided that, given the target users of that family, facilitation of bilingual text was the most important factor. So Adobe Hebrew Italic has a right-slant to harmonise with the Latin italic. Apart from other considerations, this decision avoids the very problematic situation that arises from common punctuation characters, shared by both scripts, needing left-slant variants that may or may not be accessed by applications. [Adobe Arabic Italic has a left-slant, and there are environments in which the punctuation variants for Latin do not work, so you end up with right-slant Latin italic letters with left-slant punctuation. Ack!]

While I agree with David that the impulse to right-slant Hebrew 'italics' in modern typographic practice probably originates from copying Latin -- for either stylistic or technical reasons --, my palaeography books show lots of examples of Hebrew writing with a right-slant, as well as examples with a left-slant. In both cases, the slant appears to be a result of writing speed, as with the development of the Latin italic, and the direction is more likely the result of the writing habits of the individual scribe than a conscious stylistic development. There are, of course, plenty of people whose Latin-script handwriting slants to the left, but this never translated into normal typographic use.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here is one example of right-slanted Hebrew writing, selected at random from <em>Manuscrits médiévaux en caractères hébraïques</em>. This example is from central Italy, from a document dated 1433, now in the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris. The same document also shows a more formal, upright writing in the larger size.

This example is instructive, I think, because one can see how such a slant would develop very naturally from writing quickly, with the down-strokes made quickly, with a flick. If you consider that the hand will be moving on, to the left, to begin writing the next letter, a flick in this direction on the down-stroke is much more natural than a movement to the right to produce a left-slanted letter. [This also accounts for the characteristic exit stroke of Latin italics: a flick up and to the right toward the starting point of the next letter.]

		<div class="commentbody"><strong>Speaking of italics,</strong> :) 
Hebrew doesn't have them. But people want and would use them.

It is not true that "italics that are leaning right is acceptable". Left leaning italics are actually <strong>preferable</strong>. 

John, you can't derive any logical preferences for Hebrew from Tzvika Rosenberg of MasterFont's actions. He does what ever is easier. If the default for slant is -12, he'll make -12 right leaning italics.

Tzika's views on Hebrew typography reject tradition (an important factor in typography but not in rocket science), and only come from his "pupick", as they say. For example, he told me that a chirik, or shva, under a vov, daled, or reish, should be off centered, so the reader does not confuse them with a final nuhn. This is logical, but it opposes centuries old tradition.

Since few italics has been made to lean right, so then left leaning italics are only <strong>tolerated</strong>.

Why should italics incline to any specific direction?
Italics are meant to follow the direction and movement of the eye.

		<div class="commentbody">The truth is that any handwriting, script-like, or italic, typeface design can incline to the right or to the left. There seemingly is nothing in the design that requires the slant to be one way or the other? Is there?

A few years ago, I created a set of fonts with joining letters to teach children to form letters correctly, to write with a clear handwriting. 

In one font, the alphabet appeared with each letter form separate, to show a child how the letter by itself is supposed to look. In a second font, the alphabet appeared with each letter form joined to the next letter to show a child how the letters together are supposed to look (this was very difficult as letters join each other differently, and there was no OpenType yet to address these different situations). In a third font, the alphabet appeared with each letter form joined to the next letter to show a child how the letters together are supposed to look, but very small arrows were added to each letter, to indicate how each letter should be correctly formed.

Most left-to-right languages, like English, have letters formed clockwise, while most right-to-left languages, like Hebrew, have letters formed counter-clockwise. However, slant plays no role in being determined by the rotation of the formation of a language's letters. Rather, the direction of eye movement is the determining factor.

This is why a right inclined letter is inappropriate for Hebrew, because eye movement is leftwards. In this incorrect case, the stress on one's eye movement in increased continously because of the letter's slant.

On John's example, I believe the very old beautiful Hebrew handwriting was likely from a right-handed person, as Rashi observes that most people write with their right hand. In writing Hebrew, the hand must be held somewhat awkward, as the arm covers the written text; hence, right slanted text is easier for the hand to form, due to the somewhat awkward position off the hand. A left-handed person has an easier time holding the pen to write Hebrew, by to produce right slanted text is easier than producing left slanted text.

I think that this correct. What does everyone else think?</div>

You typed this in typophile.com, on Mac or Windows, in Explorer, Firefox, or Safari?

In Adobe InDesign ME, when you type in Hebrew, and also pick the main text direction is left-to-right, and type also some words in English (inserting the letters from right-to-left), the words first appear in opposite order when you type the space character, but afterwards corrects itself with another word.

Did you type only one word, and then move the cursor to the place you thought it should be? Afterwards, when you typed the second word, then the sequence of words was reversed.

Or did you type both words one after the order, without moving the cursor?</div>

Have you tried to write formal Hebrew letters -- i.e. letters written with a broad-nib pen, not a ballpoint or pencil -- with your left hand, or watched a left-handed person trying to write such forms. Instinctively, because the script is written from right-to-left, one imagines that it might be easier for left-handed writers. But the only benefit for left-handers is that their hand does not obscure what has already been written: there are no benefits to the formation of individual letters; indeed, the traditional steep ductus (pen angle) requires either a very awkward angle to the arm and wrist or rotation of the page. Further, what are normally pull-strokes for right-handers become difficult push-strokes for left-handers. Try it.</div>

Yes, XeLaTeX is meant for TrueType and OpenType. I could take John's list above and typeset it in four columns using XeLaTeX. I could also compare side by side SBL Hebrew and Adobe Hebrew with that same list (using a few unix commands and scripts to produce a .tex input file).

Thank you for the links.

I saw this book when I was a child, Toby’s "The Art of Hebrew Lettering", that has many Hebrew alphabets with arrows showing how to correctly form Hebrew letters.



[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sfardi_aleph_3710.jpg]



The "sfaradi" script caught my attention, as my research showed that many Askenazic-stlye scripts had the shapes of the aleph as this one, with the right top element facing to the left, and Sephardic-style alephs with right top element facing to the right. Here is an example:



[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Alephs_5988.jpg]
.
.
Does anyone have older manuscripts with either Sephardic-style alephs with right top element facing to the right, or Askenazic-style scripts with the shapes of the aleph  with right top element facing to the left, or otherwise?


John, I know you have and seen many older manuscrpts with Hebrew. Have you seen this? Do you think this is an accurate distictive trait?</div>

Sergey Malkin, the VOLT programmer at MS, used to say that SBL Hebrew was the most complex OpenType font he had examined. The only reason he doesn't still say it is that I've made another font (not Hebrew) that is even more complex.

Contextual GPOS lookups seem to take a longer time to process than most other lookups. The new version of SBL Hebrew I am working on uses GSUB to precombine below-base mark combinations, so that will probably speed things up somewhat. At the end of the day, though, the Bible text presents a complicate piece of typesetting, which requires some special behaviours in a font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Israel, I think your analysis of aleph forms is halfway correct. Yes, the construction of the flag is one of the style indicators, but it must be checked against other features of the individual typeface or writing hand: there are other features, such as the baseline shape of shin and related forms, that are probably more significant. I must also point out that I have not looked at as many Ashkenazic exemplars as Sephardic, so can't say for sure what variety of flag forms might be found in that style.

In Sephardic styles, there are two basic constructions for the flag: a single stroke down to the right and then curving to the left, and a returning stroke down to the right and then doubling back and down to the left. What is important is the construction pattern, rather than the resulting shape, which can be misleading in some cases. This is why I think you are misclassifying Adobe Hebrew as Ashkenazic. If you look at the construction of the aleph flag in Adobe Hebrew, the returning construction is evident. So although the flag shape is much more horizontal than in the traditional Sephardic styles, the stroke construction is derived from the Sephardic model. And, of course, if you look at the bottom of the shin, samekh, etc., these are very clearly Sephardic forms.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Michel,

Thanks for the references. 

I knew I saw it in a few places in Genesis: "v'yave'k'", meaning "and he cried", from the Hebrew verb for "to cry", "liv'coat". 


[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vayave_k_3602.jpg]
.
.
The first two letters of the 3 letter root are each veis, the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Seemingly, the third letter of the 3 root letters, hei, falls away, in this case, and is represented by a dagesh point in the second letter of the 3 letter root, the final chaf. (Perhaps, the dagesh point is representative of an indirect pronoun, referring to the cheek upon which Joseph cried). So, a shva appears below, and a dagesh above it.

I wonder what makes this Hebrew text "from some Karaite tanakh". 

I know the Christian Bible and the traditional Jewish tanach has some minor differences, mainly in the nikkud and taamim. 

There two versions of the traditional Jewish tanach. In one version the hei and the end of a word appears which is logical, grammatically correct, and to be expected. In the other version, accepted by the Chassidic groups, the hei is replaced with an aleph, which is illogical, seemingly grammatically incorrect, and not to be expected. 

However, in one of the oldest copies of a Sefer Torah scroll, which existed in the famed Maharal of Prague's synagogue, the oldest standing synagogue until Nazis destroyed it, in a certain word an aleph appeared at its conclusion and not a hei. This would indicate that the Chassidic tradition is correct, since it has historical verification.

According to Jewish mystical texts, this difference is more than just scholarly. The entire Five Books of Moses (Chumash) spells out G-d's name. The entire text, from the first letter, an aleph, until the last, a lamed, and all the letters in between, is precise. So, it's meaningful and significant whether it's an aleph or whether it's a hei.


*   *   *

If you notice, in my sample, both the dagesh and the shva is lifted up above the baseline. This is for purely aesthetic purposes, as having the dagesh lifted up, and the shva below, a large gap if white space exists between then, plus when taam and meteg appear, there is very little room to place them, plus there is a blatant inconsistency between the occurrence when no dagesh appears and when a dagesh appears.</div>

I am not sure I understand. 

Here is the story: I googled to get some utf8 Tanakh and found this <a href="http://www.karaite-korner.org/downloads/tanach.html"><strong>Tanakh: Masoretic text with vowels</strong></a> in a site where it is written "World Karaite Movement Downloads". That gave me a .doc file that Word 2008 on my mac showed me as just question marks. I saved it in html format, edited the html to change the encoding header to utf8, opened that html with a browser which displayed it correctly, copied and pasted the text into an editor that allows utf8 editing to finally save a utf8 .txt file. I think that's my record in the number of steps I had to apply to get some workable .txt file from a source. After that I "massaged" a bit the .txt file.

In fact, I wanted to test a python script I had in my things to get trigrams from the utf-8 input but for some reason it skipped all vowel points and gave me nothing useful. The above output comes from a simple grep.

'Christian Bible' doesn't refer to anything in this context, since there is no single Hebrew text recognised as finally authoritative. Rather there are a few different lines of approach to the Jewish scriptures in Christianity:

The Greek Orthodox (and presumably Eastern Catholic) Churches still use the Septuagint (LXX) text, i.e. the Greek translation prepared by Jewish scholars in Alexandria, between the 3rd and 1st Centuries BC, and which was used by Jewish communities during the Hellenistic period. After the destruction of the Temple, rabbinical tradition restored the Hebrew version and established the Palestine canon, excising those books of the Septuagint for which Hebrew texts were not available.

The Septuagint is also the basis of the Slavonic, Armenian, Syro-Hexeplar, and Coptic versions.

Following use of Latin tanslations from the Septuagint, the Roman Catholic Church in the late 4th Century adopted Saint Jerome's Latin version translated directly from Hebrew texts. A few years ago, Pope John Paul II announced that new Catholic translations would take into account the latest scholarship of the earliest surviving Hebrew texts found at Qumran.

Today, almost all scholars studying the Hebrew scriptures -- whether Jewish or Christian -- work with the Masoretic text as preserved in the surviving Ben Asher manuscripts, the most complete of which is the Codex Leningradensis and the oldest of which is the Aleppo Codex. These Masoretic manuscripts are the oldest standard texts containing nikudot and ta'amim. Pre-masoretic texts are largely unvocalised and without cantillation. The Masoretes standardised the vocalisation and cantillation. The consonant text of different versions shows very little variations -- testimony to how carefully it was transmitted --: even the very oldest surviving texts, found at Qumran, are almost identical to that preserved in the Masoretic texts from a thousand years later.</div>

Thank you for the comments. I will review carefully your points.

Regarding defining the design traits of Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions, I think we are treading upon new ground, as I have never seen this form of analysis before (even though in 2008 you would think that no one could discover something new).

This belongs in another thread, but can an MS Volt and an OpenType source file, or a font to ship, have a reference to a complex exception table for look ups?

For example, can I designate a CSUB to occur whereby one string "a" is replaced with a different string "b", except in the cases listed in the exception table.

Another question about MS Volt/OpenType support wild cards in the CSUB strings, whereby one string "a" with a wild card or more in between is replaced with a different string "b" with the same wild card or more in between?</div>

Has anyone documented the differences? 

I was told by Philip Payne of Linquistics that the differences are only in few letters, nikkudot, ans taamim. Very few.

He told that there is a very old rabbi in Jerusalem that understands all the very minor differences, but like many Orthodox, he refuses to engage in a dialogue with Christians about the Bible.

Interestingly, his OpenType Biblical Hebrew fonts crashed in Adobe InDesign ME but not in MS Word for Windows, while SBL-Hebrew performed the opposite.

I am running XeLaTeX on OS X 10.4. Darwin is unix. When I work on my mac, the screen is filled with shell windows. To get a "grep"able input above, I used the standard Unix commands sed, and awk on my mac (in fact, I compiled gawk to get a bit more than awk). I also compiled XeLaTeX from the sources on my mac using the standars commands "configure", "make" and "sudo make intall". In fact, I often start the fontbook by just typing "open /applications/Fon*ook.app" intead of browsing (I could have put a script in my $HOME/bin folder). That's all oldtime unix.

Are you familiar with the page layout of a page of Talmud?

I seek to know whether XeLaTeX or InDesign ME is better more robust engine to typeset a new edition of the Talmud.

A page of Talmud consists of three parallel text blocks. 

The outer left and right text blocks have two widths, a wider width at the top and bottom of the column, and the center part has a narrower width. 

The center block only has one width. At the line under the depth of the center block, the two outer blocks return to wider length, which they had at the top.

I would like to create a script to automate the page layout of some 20,000 pages which are formatted in this way.

I seek to know if this is possible using XeLaTeX.</div>

No but enough to think that doing the layout from scratch would not be an easy job. If you know well InDesign and think it can do the job then, in my opinion, you should stick with it. There is no better environment than the one we know.

I know LaTeX because I use it to typeset mathematics. That is a tool I have been using for years.

I have noticed (on non extensive tests) that justification of narrow columns in InDesign seems to be better than with TeX even if in principle InDesign justification is based on Knuth's algorithm. That might also be a point to take into account if your columns get narrow.

I tried Henri GH on MS Word for Office 2007 on Vista with the Book of Joshua. No crash. It used to take down XP, too! I guess UniScribe is much stronger now. The furtive patach stayed centered.

Why do think Philip's OT Biblical Hebrew crashed InDesign ME but not MS Word even on XP?

Also, Adil Allawi's Ready Set Go International could display every CSUB in Payne's fonts or SBL? But it didn't crash XP or itself.

Thank you for your views.

I am before typeseting over 30,000 complex pages (it's contained in 20 thick volumes of 11" x 17" pages of many different columns. It's done every 200 years of so. :) ).

As you can imagine, I want to automate the page layout as much as possible.

The question is can a script be written in InDesign ME to do the page layout, and just pour in the text data. I would like to change the typeface, and its all automatically vocalized with the correct nikkud.</div>

If you look at page 7 of the article (from tugboat) <a href="http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb24-1/hoenig.pdf"><strong>Makor: Typesetting Hebrew with Omega</strong></a> you will see what can be done with another extension of Tex-LaTeX, namely Omega, to typeset the Talmud. The files are freely available <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hebrew/makor/"><strong>here on CTAN</strong></a>. I have no idea how easy it would be to adapt those sources to some extension of TeX-LaTeX using otf fonts (there is XeTeX-XeLaTeX, there is also luaTeX available for the pc that I have never tried and that, I think, is in a more experimental state than XeTeX).

		<div class="commentbody">Michel,

Thank you for the reference to Makor, and the fascinating article.

My concern are the fonts.

I seek the typesetting engine to fully support OpenType's context substitution features (CSUB), supported by InDesign ME (which uses its own internal marking engine on either platform) but not by MS Word (which uses UniScribe on XP and much more robust on Vista).

I noticed that in terms of precise positioning (CPOS), XeLaTeX performed, but in terms of stylistic alternatives and contextual replacement (CSUB) then XeLaTeX's performance is questionable.

For example, the ayin patach lamed combination is a good example for use of a stylistic alternative, and shin kubutz ayin patach combination of a contextual replacement.

In the first case, the ayin changes from the form where part of it dips below the baseline, and is replaced a different ayin with the form which remains above the baseline, to make room for the patach.

In the second more complicated case, the patach itself is repositioned according to the context: being under ayin (or chet or dagesh hei) and following certain consonant/vowel combinations.

He cites design flaws without going into any details. He neglects to mention the involvement of Bodoni's school of type design in its creation, as reported and published by Frederick Goudy.

For such an important type design, you would think that it would get more than a passing remark.

How do I contact him?

As I understand it, OTF fonts are more than fonts of other formats, such as TrueType or PostScript, with just a header added to it to make it multi-platform.

Rather, OTF fonts contain programming instructions that affect formatting and appearance. To achieve this, OTF fonts need to be rendered on a marking engine, such as Microsoft's UniScribe, Adobe InDesign's internal marking engine, and Apple's limited one.

A code-based application, such as Tex-LaTeX, uses no marking engine, and simply sends its formatting codes, however complex, to output, to a screen proofing mode, to a desktop printer, or to higher resolution device.

So, the special contribution of OTF is lost at this time. I'm sure the world won't stand still, and Tex's brilliant people will add a means to tap into the power of OTF fonts.</div>

This is history now.

I don't even have that Dell desktop anymore. I recall it was Word XP, or Word 2000, definately not an Office version.

I have an old Compag Presario though. I'll test it there. It has Word. I have .doc files of the Bible in Hebrew. I'll download SBL-Hebrew. If it crashes, great. It not, it was a fluke. 

I recall that it happenned AFTER I installed Phil Payne's New Jerusalem OT font. It had its own installer (didn't use the control panel's font installer) to unencrypt the font. I had to unencypt his data files of the Bible, too. Maybe, it was a delayed reaction to his software.

Featured is the first complete Biblical Hebrew OpenType font by John Hudson, called "SBL-Hebrew", made for the worldwide SBL organization. It both captures very old Ashkenazic and Sephardic scripting technigues, and is also modern, and original in design.

There are a few classic designs from Microsoft, "FrankRuehl" and "David". In my opinion, they are authentic faithful versions. 

Note the faithful rendition of the aleph in Microsoft's bold weight. Notice also the aleph in FontBit's bold weight. The aleph from Apple's Raanana Bold is very sloppy, and amatuerishly produced. The design is made to simulate the strokes of a quill. Here it looks highly unnatural.

It is the application (Word, pdfTeX, XeTeX, inDesign) that does the processing; the font can in some way be seen as a program that is interpreted by the application  but, in order to do so, the application often relies on system calls or libraries. It is my understanding that Adobe applications depend much less on system calls (or non Adobe libraries) than most other applications.</div>

My HP All-In-One had to be shipped back to HP, due to its paper jam. Real technical problem. (Btw, HP discontinued the model, and replaced it with a similar one. Makes a person suspicious.) It may take over a week.

I asked my son for Vayikra (Leviticus). Will pick it up on Friday.

Where did you find those images of Itamar David's three weights? I never saw the third very black poster weight. It's not in David's book on Hebrew Type Design, nor was it among my excellent collection of drawings of popular Israeli type designs (even though he wasn't Israeli.)

It shows a design similar to Tzvika's. Touche, it might be a design integrity, but I doubt Tzvika saw that.

If I was a design critic, the third design is a big leap from the second, and its right side looks unevenly weighted than its left side. The part connecting the right arm to the center is ackwardly too thin.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Earlier John Hudson agreed in part with the distinction between Ashkenazic type designs and Sephardic type designs by the pinpointing of the direction of the "flag" in the upper right hand side of the aleph. When the flag was pointed rightwards, this indicated that the design was Ashkenazic; when the flag was pointed leftwards, this indicated that the design was Sephardic.

He preferred the concept brought in Misha Beletsky's analysis (in his essay on Zvi Narkiss’ work in the book Language Culture Type) that the style of the stroke movement was an indicator, as Ashkenazic stroke movements were typically different than Sephardic stroke movements. See above.

In my view, both are distinct issues. I am pointing out design traits. John, if I understand him correctly, is emphasizing the use of the medium to compose. In the comparison below, the issue of design traits appears the main factor, as these designs are "full", and are not reflective of the stroke movements associated with composition.

What is a "revival"? What is a "faithful rendition"? David re Raanana; Hadasa re Henri; Koren re Crown; Narkis Tam ne Neshika (inspired Ariel Hebrew)?

Let's take Hadasa, for example.

Many foundries have created near-faithful versions or adaptations of Hadasa, either called Hadasa, Hadas, or New Hadasa. Each one was a little different than Friedlaender's original design. FontBit's New Hadasa is a lot different.

FontWorld's Queen Esther and GoHebrew's Henri stayed faithful to the original design. To preserve the designer's original intent, this then is a "faithful original". Henri Friedlaender himself saw FontWorld's predecessor, Otzar Haoht's Esther, and commented: "This is the closest to the original to date." This was after Linotype, IBM and others attempted to offer their versions.

A modification, even where the design is changed to comply with accepted design principals, is similar, a close interpretation, or even a poor knock-off, is not faithful.

A revival, for better or worst, is a new popularization of a dormant design.

Take "Romm" for example. In the 1800's it was the most popular and most used Hebrew type design, until "FrankReuhl" tooks its crown. In the mid and late 1900's, "Room" disappeared. If one could say kaddish and keep yahrzeit for a type design, we'd be making it a yahrzeit every year.

GoHebrew's faithful rendition of this design of the Romm family of Vilna, Lithuania is in deed also revival.

To stick 100% to the original design, and to suppress any creative innovative urges, no matter how good, requires tremendous self-discipline and dedication.

The veis on Itamar was changed, so the protrusion on the bottom right side was longer and more distict, than the chof. A client insisted on this change, as this design was implemented with nikkud/taamim etc. and used in a series of study books for children on the haftorahs.

This was about 14 years ago. It was an Apple Maintosh, System 7.x, Quark XPress (US edition), a custom keyboard driver. And a special nikkud/taamim etc. input system called "XPressions".

I haven't decided whether to change the veis back, as the new one is much easier to read.

Otherwise, I would say: "Yes, Itamar is a faithful original." I'm sure that Itamar David a"h is pleased.</div>

I'm running around today doing errands.

It seems you and Rabbi Winefeld are using different rules for shva-na. I heard about two sets of rules, based upon two views of different Rishonim, early redactors of Bible and Talmud.

Btw, Shay Lemorah and Kehot place different sets of shva-na on texts. Kehot places symbols over shvas that Shay Lemorah does not.

I seek to understand the two kinds of rules. Where in Dr. Chomsky's book is this discussed?</div>

I don't think so.  Sheva na is sheva na. Why  "Kehot places symbols over shvas that Shay Lemorah does not" — very simple: Editorial decisions. 

See, for example the siddur Tehillas Hashem (kehot,2002), page 17 — kriat shema: do you see the custom mark above the first letter bet (word #1)? This is sheva na, right? But some say this is sheva nach!!! That said, according to the Rulings of Rabbi A this is na; and Rabbi B this is nach.  Do you have any solution?

I think that we're actually saying the same thing. You call it: "editorial decisions". I call it: "different rules".

I think that this is because you are more from a secular background, where people who have different views is very common. I prefer it this way; no, I prefer it another way.

In ultra-Orthodox circles where I masquerade (baalei teshuva are a different species, knowing "both sides of the coin", the secular life and the very observant lifestyle), there is no room to make a decision based purely upon ones preference.

If respected rabbinical scholars espouse different views, if it is based upon a set of reasoning, an earlier opinion, etc., then there must be a set of rules underlying all this decision making afterwards. 

I believe if Hebrew grammar is logical, if greats like Chomsky, Kimchi, and even earlier Rishonim addressed this subject in a scholarly manner, the basis of different ensueing views must be due to a different set of rules.</div>

Really? The same siddur by Kehot, the introduction:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/siddurA_4195.gif]

Can you read and understand the Hebrew? Grammatically the meteg is not light meteg, firm meteg etc. etc. etc.; the goal of the meteg is just to help the reader; the meteg is millera and mille'el;  This is an editorial decision!!! Compare this siddur to Koren or ArtScroll. 

And you didn't answer my questions.</div>

Shavuah tov.

> <cite>...according to the Rulings of Rabbi A this is na; and Rabbi B this is nach. ...Rabbi Shelomo Hanau...</cite>

I wonder if he was the Minchas Shai (a great expert opinion on Hebrew grammar and definition of a shva-na), for his name may be an acronym for Shai.

Regarding the Radak (Rabbi David Kimchi), Ibn Ezra and Gaon of Vilna, these were much greater scholars that the the Minchas Shai.

However, Shay Lemorah cites that his editorial decisions regarding the shva-na are based upon the views of the early Rishonim (Ibn Ezra was in deed a Rishon, as was the Radak) and the Minchas Shai). 

The Vilna Gaon, Rabbi Eliyahu, was fairly recent, about nine generations ago. He is a widely accepted scholar, highly respected for his broad knowledge, but he promoted opinions based upon his own analysis of the Talmud, in opposition to the views of great Rishonim before him, an attitude greatly frowned upon by the Rebbes of Lubavitch. 

For example, a left-handed Jewish male must put the arm-tefillin upon his right arm, whereas most Jewish men, who are right-handed, must put them on their left arm.

What consitutes left-handedness? Is your stronger arm the arm you throw with (brute power), or write with (intellectual dominance)?

Until the Vilna Gaon, the major redactors of Jewish law concluded that the hand you write with belongs to the stronger hand. The Vilna Gaon disagrees, based upon his understanding of the Talmud, contradicting sages greater than him.

Rabbi Shneur Zalman, the first Lubavitcher Rebbe, and his replacements, strongly opposed the Vilna Gaon's ruling. I was fortunate to show how the Vilna Gaon erred by citing an Talmudic explanation from Rabbi Shneur Zalman's younger brother, the Maharil.

Another example in in the perception of the universe according to the teach ancient Jewish mystical literature (very similar to recent discoveries in modern physics). Rabbi Shneur Zalman explained the Baal Shem Tov's understanding of the holy Arizal's teachings. The Vilna Gaon's opposed this understanding, and promoted an alternative view.

Today, we only have one perception of the G-d's precence in the universe, based upon Rabbi Shneur Zalman's explanation of the Baal Shem Tov's understanding of Arizal's teachings. No one understands anymore what the Vilna Gaon was trying to express (indicative that it did not make sense).</div>

Who is behind the web site www.dikdouk.free.fr ? The person seems very knowledgeable?

I am having a very difficult time finding knowledgeable people about Hebrew grammar in the Orthodox Jewish world. With the exception of this very old man, Rabbi Shmuel Yehuda Winefeld (of Shay Lemorah publishing house of Jerusalem), no one seems to know this stuff expertly.

You see here, there are a very small handful of knowledgeable people, but no one is an astounding expert. No offense, anyone.

I really feel that knowledge of Hebrew grammar must be achieved by many thousands of people, before this knowledge dies altogether.</div>

Is Michel a French name similar to the English name Michael?

As you likely know, Michael is one of the names of the prominant angels. He visited Abraham, and later was assigned to deliver destruction to Sedom. He is associated with the attribute of "severity" or "gevurah" in Jewish mystical writings.


> Solomon Hanau (1687-1746) would be שלמה זלמן הנאו and that link refers to Hanau, Solomon Ben Judah...

My guess that he was not the Minchat Shai, although the initials ש and י do spell the acronym  ש"י Shai.

Did you read Chomsky's book? Isn't it poorly organized. He does have a structure, but the text seems to be written for other scholars (peers in knowledge of Hebrew grammar).

Clearly, it is not intended to raise a person to become a peer.

The only page with that quote that I can find is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Gilgamesh/Tanakh_names"><strong>this unfinished project</strong></a> on Tanakh names.  When I look at the line for אַשְׁקְלוֹן, the table gives "ashklon" as the current accepted pronunciation. I would like to know from native hebrew speakers who does not voice the sheva under the qof in אשקלון. A voiced sheva is a tiny thing, but it makes the difference between בְּרֹאשׁ (at the head) and בְרוֹשׁ (cypress). My understanding is that those entries were computer generated; that would care for the "algorithm".

I am attempting to include a set of algorithms to be part of OpenType Hebrew fonts, which perform a contextual analysis of a string of Hebrew letters, nikkud, taamim, metegs, that make up a Hebrew word.

The goal of each algorithm, if warranted, is to replace a kamatz with a kamatz katan, a shva with a shva na, a kamatz katan with a hataf kamatz katan, and to insert a meteg as needed. (My long term goal is automatic addition of nikkud etc. - this is done already in software, so I am confidant that it can be done in OpenType as well.)

If the logical grammar rules for kamatz katan, shva na, etc. can be discerned and defined, this then is doable.

Software can access dictionaries. That is how spell checkers work. Opentype fonts are not meant for that purpose. I don't see how it is possible to add nikkuds without accessing a dictionary, and maybe do more (i.e. perform some grammatical analysis). </div>

Of course, I hope that you are incorrect. I recognize that you have more experience here, but I am very determined. This determination is not deluding, but motivates me to try creative solutions that you may not consider.

OpenType, according to my limited understanding can access a database, and features a replacement mechanism. In my view, a string with wide-card variables can be replaced with another string from a database, and the kind of variables can refer to another database that modifies the replaced string, if the specific grammar rules can be defined.

I am not considering the an OpenType font perform grammatical analysis, but simply replace a string for a different string.

Perhaps, this is not doable; perhaps, it is.

According to my poor understanding of Hebrew, its languaguage and grammar, it's rules are logic-based, with exception tables. Hence, once the rules are defined, and the tables constructed, grammatical analysis is not required.

I might be incorrect, but I hope and think not.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Michel,

From your example and your recent postings, you appear to be focused upon the issue of automatic nikkud via an OpenType font, which I proposed may be a feature of a "smart" OpenType font of the future.

Truly, in a peripheral and wishful thought, I think it's possible. You clearly do not.

I wasn't going to put my focus upon it at this time, until after I knew OpenType's GSUB and database capabilities, and the intracasies of Hebrew grammar, both much better and first hand (which I don't yet).

In my stubbornness, I still (perhaps, naively) think incorporating it into OpenType is possible. 

As I understand it, the dictionary/spell-checker look-up is to correct the error factor of the software. Meaning, the algorythm in the software performs the job with an error ratio, and the spell checker's purpose is to correct these errors.

At first glance at your examples, the difference in spelling seems only contextual. When one spelling follows after a type of word, eg. כי, the string (the spelling is with a tsere) is one way, but if it's following a different type, eg. not כי, the string is not this way.

It would appear that a wildcard and a qualification table would address this, eg. if the string is such and such, with various wildcards, and it is not such and such, with various wildcards, then it should be replaced as such and such.

Your examples convince me that OpenType can achieve this (although there may be some percentage of inaccuracy, as there is no spell-checker).

Again, my immediate goal is not auto-nikkud or auto-taam or auto-meteg. These are lofty goals.

Rather, my immediate goal is a set of algorythms to automate replacement of certain shvas with shva-na, of certain kamatzes with kamataz gadols, and certain kamatz gadols with hataf kamatz gadols.

First, I want to see if they are doable, and if they are, can it be processed in a reasonable amount of time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Spell checkers are tools used to correct mistakes when you type in a text editor. There are spell checkers for modern Hebrew, for instance HSpell on which <a href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~danken/"><strong>Dan Kenigsberg</strong></a> (Ph.D. in computer sciences) has worked. 

My knowledge of biblical hebrew is very limited but it is my feeling that the string "כי בליל חמיץ יאכלו" might have occurred in the Tanakh and the "כי" would not help deciding to what dictionary entry בליל corresponds.

As for identifying "certain shvas", some may be easier than others indeed. What's the need to identify the easy ones if the reader should already know? And how do you decide the sheva under the bet in בליל without looking up the dictionary?

		<div class="commentbody">Michel,

About whether the word כי influences the nikkud spelling of בליל is unclear to me yet. I simplt don't know enough Hebrew grammar.

The custom of publishers who identify the shva-na is to only deal with those that appear in the middle of a word, and not to a shva that appears under the first letter of a word. I am told that it is always a shva-na.

===

David,

The Eretz Chemdah organisation of Israel, a Halacha deciding institute of the Orthodox Union, informs me that a shva following a kamatz katan is always a shva-na. Does that mean that every kamatz before a shva-na is a kamatz katan?

I asked Eretz Chemdah for the name of a book of Hebrew grammar to verify this statement.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Israel, I don't understand why you are so insistent that nikkud be done through open type, when it already can be done by dictionary look ups. Dagesh, the word processor, already has [[http://www.jewishsoftware.com/products/Dagesh_Pro_IV_+_BONUS_Printable__Editable_Texts_1208.asp?bhcd2=1223303755|auto-nikkud]], which will automatically insert nikkud. 

If you want to distinguish shva na and shva nach, then I think that could be done also to a great extent by dictionary look ups. (I assume auto-nikkud doesn't do this as yet.) David has said that whether the shva is voiced or not may also depend on cantillation marks. That being so, then what is the problem with just doing that ad hoc? The Tanach is long, but finite, and the computer has no problem in remembering what is what. And, as Michel points out, there is anyway sometimes ambiguity as to what word is meant, when the text lacks nikkud. So that surely has to be resolved by an already pointed text of the Tanach. You have to go with a look-up. 

I just don't see your point in trying to do everything by open type, which is only syntactical. What you want can be done anyway by other means, and seems to be impossible only relying on syntax.  </div>

Thank you for citing and posting Chomsky's distinction about the shva that begins words.

If that shva is not a shva-na, but one of the exceptional kinds, I nevertheless have never seen a graphic symbol placed over the first Hebrew letter with a shva when it is applicable, to indicate that it is not one of the exception types.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Michel, thanks for that reference, which corresponds more with modern Hebrew. Now the shva is starting to make more sense. In [[http://books.google.com/books?id=Zhjd_m5hIeIC&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82&dq=liquid+consonants+in+Hebrew&source=web&ots=Q-rKTPba1J&sig=VRfBmY8r8XH2t4eq7_XCSHw7ik8&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result|this grammar, which I found on Google Books]], p. 50 on the "shewa", it is clear that the distinction between the shva na and nach--i.e., when the shva is voiced and not, was never really clear. 

And in modern Hebrew the shva is generally pronounced when it is grammatically significant, and otherwise generally not, unless it is really a tongue-twister. Thus 'bracha', blessing, and not 'beracha', but "berosh hashanah", on rosh hashanah, and not "brosh hashanah". And what may be tongue-twisters for non-natives, like 'gdolah' (big) instead of 'gedolah' is utterly unproblematic for native speakers. 

All of this leads me to a philosophical issue. In the Tanach itself, since scholars argue about how exactly to interpret the combination of nikkud and ta'amei hamikra, whether to introduce distinctions not already existing in the Tiberian system them seems an editorial decision--which scholar are you going to follow?

And when it comes to the Siddur, the prayer book, it seems to me the better path is just to follow modern Hebrew, if you are going to specially label the shva na and kamatz katan. After all, Hebrew is now, thanks to God and the Israelis, a living language, and we don't know how it was pronounced in the days of Isaiah or whomever.

1.  Minhat Shay: Rabbi Yedidiah Solomon Raphael Norzi.  The nature of his work is not like Radak  —  so why to compare and say "these were much greater scholars"? Norzi was a great scholar and too ahead of his time!!!

2. Sheva: Every Sheva Under The First Letter Is NA!!!!  

3.  An important work about the sheva is the Treatise on the Sheva — discovered in the Cairo Geniza (Kurt Levy,
Zur Masoretischen Grammatik, 1936) ; for example, the Treatise says the letter dalet (shev na) should be pronounced with hataf-hirik, hirik-hatuf. That said, sheva na + hirik -- 1 Chronicles 24:20 
 [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ayeh_4625.gif]

 There are maybe 5 words with hirik-hataf, hirik-hatuf; see the Aleppo Codex --  Psalm 14:1
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aheyb_5074.gif] 

another important work is Hidayat Al-Qari; and of course ben Asher.

4. Kamats before shva na is Gadol.  

5. If you really want to learn about  Ashkenazi pronunciation  see the work by Rabbi Shabtai Sofer

6.  My opinion -- pick one grammar book. Just 1! But read it from A to Z; later on pick a new book. otherwise you're not going to find your head, legs, arms etc. etc. :)

First, my profession is to make professional typeface software. 

The newest standard industry font format is OpenType, as you know. In addition to basic typographical features, such as: outline font definitions, unification of Adobe PostScript and Microsoft/Adobe TrueType font formats, Unicode support (and double byte characters), OpenType also offers very sophisticated placement of diacritic marks, and intelligent replacement of complex strings of glyphs.

I seek to include use of these features in the professional typeface software which I create, so they have a competitive advantage over other manufacturer's products.

Second, most users do not know of or understand many rules of Hebrew grammar. Hence, an automatic replacement and positioning feature is useful both to use Hebrew grammar correctly without its complete knowledge, and to learn their intricasies easily (by simply turning OpenType off and on at will in Adobe InDesign ME CS/2,3,4 ad beyond).

Third, Hebrew text is available for most everything imaginable, except newly written materials. By including these glyphs and including an automatic replacement and positioning feature, this existing text can be easily modified prior to viewing or printing by simply using the professional typeface software which I create.


It may not be possible to accomplish everything mentioned, or even a small  part of it. But the advantages that result from success warrant a valiant effort, as our sages obm promise: "Yagata umatzata, ta'amin" "effort finds success". 

It's worth trying.</div>

<cite>1. Kamatz Katan
However, in the Sephardic pronunciation there exists a clear distinction between Kamatz Katan and Kamatz Gadol, and even the Ashkenazic pronunciation, which does not distinguish as such, still recognizes the difference in that the type of Kamatz will usually determine whether a Shva following it will be a Shva Na or a Shva Nach.</cite>

This statement says clearly that the kind of shva, na or nach is usually determined by the kind of kamatz, gadol or katan, before it. Not vice versa, as I incorrectly suggested that was stated.

I asked: <cite>"[Should] kamatz katan, hataf kamatz katan, meteg, and shva-na, ... be included in ...prayerbooks?</cite>

The answer was: <cite>"...the few prayer books which do mark off Kamatz Katan certainly contribute towards correct pronunciation...As for pronunciation, what was written about Kamatz Katan is applicable to Hataf Kamatz, as well...In some rare instances, the distinction between a Shva Na and a Shva Nach can technically change the meaning of a word."</cite>

My guess is that it is a hiriq that is "stolen" (by assimilation) from the following syllable. That would be the sound given to the sheva according to the following rule that can be found in the same article from Chomsky.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hatuf_6560.jpg]

Such a phenomenon occurs in russian; for instance, the name Dmitri is pronounced as if there was a "length 0" i after the D, giving a D that sounds is if an "i" was following, but the result is not quite as if the name was  Dimitri.

The most important thing is the context; we have to see the whole verse, or at least couple words before & after.

For example, the word Canaan. The dagesh (letter kaf) is.....kal, right? 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cnanan1_5554.gif]

But when we see the context,  words before & after, nikkud, ta'amim etc. etc.   — the dagesh is not kal but hazak (conjunctive dagesh, and by the Masorah: dehik, ate merahik).

Sorry. The first letter of a word.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">David, what does strong vs weak dagesh have to do with the issue of when it's a shva na?

My interest in this is how best to transliterate names. Here are some Sages' names:


 [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sages' names_5253.gif]

The Art Scroll "Avos Treasury" transliterates the first as Yehoshua ben Perachia, the second as Elazar ben Azaria, the third as Yochanan ben Beroka, the fourth as Schmuel Hakattan, and the fifth as Chanina ben Tradyon.

I'm totally with them that Elazar is better than the traditional spelling Eleazar; the shva under the lamed is a shva nach, I think. 

I'm also with them on Yehoshua. You need the 'e', otherwise it's unpronounceable, and under yod must be a shva na, according to the quote above from Chomsky. 

But why do they write "Perachia" and "Beroka", as if it's a shva na, but "Tradion" and "Shmuel," as if these are shva nach?

I would think that in modern Hebrew it would be "Prachia" and "Broka"--both schva nach, but you tell me. 

Are there any rules going on here, ancient or modern, or are they just going modern with "Tradion" and "Shmuel", but not with the others?

I would think that following the quote from Chomsky, none except "Yehoshua" would be shva na. 

Count me confused.

		<div class="commentbody">I now have read the article by William Chomsky, and indeed the part Michel quotes does relate to modern Hebrew. But there is more which I find very enlightening. Chomsky--by the way the father of the great linguist and US government hater, Noam Chomsky--concludes: 

"Both the historical evidence and actual usage seem to point to the conclusion that the rules about the vocal and silent shewa in our grammatical texts and taught to our pupils are either superfluous or unfounded."

These arcane rules were invented or divined by David Kimhi (~1160-1235 CE). Before this the description of use of the shva na was that it occured at the first letter of a word, the second of two letters with shva under them, or with two identical consonents. That's it. And as far as any Hebrew as actually spoken--either ashkenazi or sfaradi--the use of the shva na on the first letter of a word is actually restricted to the 'liquid consonants', ylmnr (yod, lamed, mem, nun, resh) and the prefixed prepositions and conjunctive vav. The actual rules of spoken Hebrew seem to me as logical and natural as the Kimhi rules seem arcane and impossible. 

The rules David Kimhi invented were then taken up by other pedants--er, grammarians--both Jewish and Christian. And they are now used to torture Israeli high school kids, who then proceed to immediately and "consistently ignore these rules in their normal conversation... This is the fate of all artificial and non-functional rules or learning."

My conclusion about transliteration is that the best way to go is not to follow "scientific" rules, which are based on the Kimhi grammar, but rather those of modern Hebrew, which in all likelihood have held sway for a very long time, if not always.

ps. Looking again at Israel's project of getting a special mark for kamatz katan and shva na to substitute from syntax only, I've got a new take. I see in Seow's grammar that it is "rare" that a syllable ending with a final letter or letter with a shva under it is "open". That means that you would rarely go wrong with an automatic substitution of a kamatz katan for a kamatz in such situations. So this could be done. Also you could automate from syntax the simple rules of spoken Hebrew for the shva na. But to automate the Kimhi rules from syntax alone--forget about it.

But 'rarely' getting it wrong is still getting it wrong. I'm reminded of the decision of the Israeli national standards body for character encoding not to encode the lower puncum extraordinarium, since it occured so rarely (five of them in the Bible text, three of those on one word). Rarely doesn't mean never, and if you want to be able to reliably typeset the Bible text then you can't rely on mechanisms that sometimes get it wrong, no matter how rarely this happens.</div>

Shana Tova - In Jewish tradition today is called "G-d's day" and every Jew is considered sin-less, because Jews are busy building their sukkahs after Yom Kippur.

In a less lofty goal (than having an automatic kamatz katan, shva na, and hataf kamatz katan), I thought to simply document every occurance of kamatz katan in the Bible(how few are there?) and create GSUBs for those strings, and a second kind of GSUB for every shva that occurs after that kamatz katan, which is certainly a shva na.

As a result, a lot of shva nas and all kamtaz katans are addressed. By the time of new updated version, we'll figure something else out.

From Bill's recent post, I think I should stop reading Chomsky.</div>

The short-coming of doing the dictionary look-up approach is that for the Bible, it might be OK, but for nikkud-meteg fonts, this does not cut it. There must be many many other workds used in Mishna, Talmud etc. poetry or even menukad newspapers and books.

The solution I'm suggesting in for Bible users: some Jews but mainly Chistian Bible students.

That's why I thuink a stage by stage approach could work better.</div>

I think perhaps you misunderstood the case: they did not encode a character for the lower punctum. So there was no way to include this entity in text. This situation has been rectified now.

<em>For the kamatz katan, I agree with you to this extent: it makes more sense to do it via a dictionary look up, and not try to create something with syntax only, which is going to work imperfectly in the end.</em>

Whichever way you do it: with a dictionary or with an algorithm, it should be a character-level operation in text, not a glyph-level operation in a font. The purpose of wanting to display the kamatz in different ways is to indicate a semantic distinction (in this case different pronunciation), and a semantic distinction is properly handled at the character level. This is precisely why Unicode accepted encoding of kamatz katan as a distinct character from kamatz gadol. The character code exists, and it should be used if one wants to make this distinction. So this is something that should be done at the text level, not at the font level, using either dictionary-based character substitutions or algorithm-based character substitutions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David,

Actually, after the fast I didn't eat a lot. They say that its not good for the body after a 26 hour fast. When I was a yeshiva bachur in Israel a few decades ago, we got "shamenet" (fatty very creamy yogurt or leben).

In shul, they had lots of cake and orange juice for everyone to break the fast. I think it's a nice custom.

In Shai Lemorah, it seems that there are only a few hundred kamatz katans. Are their different systems for determining a kamatz katan?

Regarding John's point that this, like shva na, should be character-based. First, there is no Unicode value for shva-na, though there should be. Second, data for all Biblical and most post-Biblical literature is already made, without these characters. Hence, a font-based solution is not intended to be a substitute for a character-based solution, but simply a viable solution to apply to all this existing data. Instead of thinking either or, be flexible and consider a third possibility.

I got my scanner back from HP. If it works, I'll post many samples, but Sukkot is upon us. Lubavitchers in Crown Heights tend to get very happy (through l'chayim) and dance every night and day, until Simchat Torah. There are live bands on Kingston Avenue until 12, and the bachurim sing all night. 

It's a Jewish Marti Gras, called Simchat Beit Hashoevah. In the times of the Second Temple, it was a regular thing during Sukkot. The Talmud says that they used to hire policemen to ensure that matters didn't get out of hand with the mingling of the sexes.

I look up the quote.

About eating and fasting, I could really lose weight. Yom Kippur should be every month! Do you look like your profile picture without the bat?</div>

Do you see how the nikkud and taam of the zayin and the reish (the 5th and 6th letters from the right) collide.

Can't we have a group of narrow letters with 2 or more combinations of nikkud and taam or meteg, followed by a daled, or reish with either a nikkud, or taam (not meteg alone), should either be centered or a certain distance from the narrow letter?

		<div class="commentbody">Israel, I just noticed your comment "I should stop reading Chomsky." Well, that depends on whether you are interested in only typesetting according to the "rules" according Chabad leaders, or also other folks--i.e. most of those who read Hebrew. If you just want to follow Chabad leaders, then just ask them and do what they say. But I doubt you are going to get a set of *rules* as you want--rather a set of *rulings*. If you want to set type for others, it seems to me Chomsky might be very informative. 

By the way, I just realized that trying to get the sheva na even from Chomsky's rules it can't be done from syntax alone. That's because you wouldn't know just from the string of letters whether the first letter is a preposition or part of the root. Of course a Hebrew speaker will know this, and put in a shva na if it is a preposition, but this also would require some kind of look-up.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">><cite>...the “rules” according Chabad leaders, or also other folks...</cite>

There are no rules from Chabad leaders, or "other folks" from recent times, except grammartarian Dr. Noam Chomsky, or the "father" of modern Hebrew (who introduced Hebrew to a word for telephone, as "telefone", or electricity as "chashmal" (a word from the Talmud for a manner to carry a fire-like energy to another place).

We only have Rabbi David Kimchi from about 800 years ago (?), the Minchat Shai (when is he from?), others like him, and the very early Rishonim. These are known expert views, accepted by everyone.

Only Kimchi and Chomsky (when is he from?) are in print. So, it's difficult to research the sources. All we have are these two among the noted Jewish scholars.

Was Chomsky like Marcus Jastrow, who ate pork and puffed on a pipe on the Sabbath? Jastrow, too, was a very great scholar. But it's hard to believe that "somebody can emit truthfulness from his mouth when it contradicts the scholars of those much greater than him, for those scholars were living examples of what they taught, while he is a great "pretender"."

Was Chomsky like the early Reform rabbis in Germany who found a loophole for anything? 

The Talmud says that there are many ways to "allow" one to hold a bug or insect while ritually immersing, but that doesn't mean it is correctly done that way. The Reform rabbis held bugs and insect while they composed their responsa in the john.


> <cite>...If you want to set type for others, it seems to me Chomsky might be very informative.</cite>

I seek to set type correctly. Truthfully. If the Hebrew Union Coolege gives me $$$ to make them custom fonts according to Chomsky, I'll tithe at least 10% to Charity.

But I doubt if anyone really cares. They won't put their money where their mouth is.


> <cite>By the way, I just realized that trying...</cite>

Ya'gah'tah uh'matza'tah, ta'ah'meen. Where there's a will there's a way. The Mishnah promises it's true!

I think <strong>multiple</strong> GSUBs and look-up tables make shva-na, kamatza katan, even meteg and auto-nikkud etc. possible.

Each look-up does a different contextual analysis, and linked together, they all result in an OpenType font capable of anything in Hebrew grammar.

Now, today, with processing speeds as fast as they are, these OpenType fonts will be much slower to process than ordinary Hebrew OpenTpe fonts. However, as processing speeds rapidly increase a lot, and dual processors support InDesign, giving way to triple processors, these complex OpenType fonts will also race.</div>

It appears that he is a very great scholar in Hebrew grammar. It does not appear that he chooses to reject authorities before him, and suggest new opinions that even Moses never heard.

William,

Let me clarify something that you seem to miss even after your continued study.

In Chabad, a person's personal observance is relative to his or her knowledge and environment, but less essential than the very core of the person. 

That's why the Chabad leader could declare the success of the Entebbe Raid was a miracle, of Biblical proportions. The first Satmar leader zatzal rejected the notion that G-d could do a miracle for a non-observant Jew.

So, if a scholar is less observant, his scholarship is not rejected, because his or her very core is still intact.

Maimpnides rules that if a Jew not only rejects his or her heritage intentionally, but also causes other Jews to go astray, his or her teshuva is in deed rejected, and his or her scholarship is burned. One can not even warm himself by the fire.

Maimonides also rules that if a Jewish child is captured and raised as a non-Jew, his or her status is unique. One may not rebuke such a person, but rather encourage him or her to return to the practice of Judaism.

The seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe contraversively ruled that our entire generations falls now in this last category. For even the most astute Torah scholar was raised with a neo-Christian Western mentality, and no longers lives in accord with Jewish practices and thought from generations ago.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Aftere the holidays of the Hebrew month of Tishrei, namely the joyful festival of Simchat Torah, I used to think it was appropriate to greet another as is customary after the Shabbat, with שבוע טוב Shavuah Tov, a Good Week!

But I was told many years ago that this was מםא appropriate, as the holiday often concluded in the middle of the week. 

Instead, it was customary for the Gabbai (the rabbi's assistant) to bank with his hand on the bimah where the Sefer Torah scroll is read, and shout out loud, יעקב הלך לדרכו "Jacob has gone on his way"!

This cyptic quotation from Scripture (Gen. 32:2) indicates a wish that one should take the spiritual recharge that came from all the holidays of Tishrei, and incorporate their vitality into the everyday life of the year.

		<div class="commentbody">David,

Thank you. Is this its title?

I think it's a play on words. A book is often prefaced by a general introduction הקדמה and a foreword מבוא from the author, which is sometimes called, עם הספר, where the author makes fascinating orginal remarks which he or she chooses not include in the chapters of the book.

How did you get it? Is it available to acquire? Does he have other books?

Regarding Prof. Dotan, is he the greatest living expert in Hebrew grammar to your best knowledge? Are there others? 

Prof. Dotan seems to agree with me that inclusion of an automatic feature in a "smart" OpenType to change text to include shvanas etc., like John Hudson's furtive patach, is worthwhile, even after much effort. Un this way, the next generation will understand and use these Hebrew grammar marks much greater than today, when it is very poorly understood.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've just read this entire thread with interest and admit some bemusement. Firstly, the article on Masorah in Encyclopedia Judaica was a bugger to typeset. It took me close to 50 hours!

Regarding make a smart font for kamatz katan and shva na. Ignoring whether this should be done or not, frankly it's irrelevant for 2 reasons: 

1) Ashkenazic masora is different from the Sefardi masora (tradition) for these grammatical nuances so for example in the Hebrew word for "afternoon", the first kamatz is gadol according to Ashkenazim and katan according to Sefardim. So what you going to do? Create a font for each tradition? Also, I don't think you understand the enormity of the task. Let me give you an example: The word Yevarekhkha in the Priestly Blessing. Notice how I've written it as a shva nach (and not how many siddurim incorrectly put it as shva na)? This is because this prayer is a biblical indictment and therefore has to be pronounced according the rules at the time and the rule to make it a shva na came a long time later. Same too with the word Ata. Notice how in siddurim a meteg (in this case the meteg indicating mileil and not a secondary stress taam meteg or a sof pasuk which some of you are calling a siluq which is a primary stress regardless of milra or mileil), is put in this word sometimes to stress it as Ata rather than aTA because that part of the prayer was from the time of the Rishonim which again had different grammatical rules. What I'm trying to say that in a siddur the rules of pronunciation change according to the period. In our proofreading of the new Koren Siddur for the USA (with translation and commentary in English), a team of 3 grammarians and rabbis have spent months and months checking the correct pronunciation with the meteg, the shva na and kamatz katan. Encoding it into Opentype would be a monumental task even if you could agree to one halakhic authority.


2) I seriously doubt the Volt could actually compile the font. 

We are currently working on the Koren Tanakh font which has kerning and correct positioning of the teamim and we have got the point where VOLT cannot compile the font and we haven't finished all the taamey mikra collisions yet. We'll optimise the font more and hopefully will manage, but if we had to put in the rules for taamey mikra then VOLT would have a fit.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Volt has no problem with shva-na, kamatz katan, or hataf kamatz katan. As Theodore Herzel was want to say: "If you can dream it, so it will be", or something like that.

Raphael, is the Koren system of nikkud/taam/meteg placement different from other systems of placement, by simply centering the nikkud as if it was the main unit, and then place the tamm and/or meteg to its left, whereas other systems center the three glyph as a single unit? 

Plus Koren's system placed the taam and meteg on a slightly lower level than the nikkud, whiles others keep all diacritics, including nikkud, on the same level.

Some change the weight of the nikkud, taam, and meteg, too. I don't think Koren did this.

Shva-na is vital, as words do change meaning because of some shva-nas, and pronunciation of course changes.

Today, most Askenazic Jews use Sephardic pronunciation, so kamatz katan is essential to pronounce prayers accurately. Askenazim who maintain tradition, and prnounce according to their tradition also benefit from kamatz katan for a few reasons, though our Jewish leaders chose not to emphasize it. This attitude is changing.

Hence, the new Koren Bible text would be negligent if it lacked them, particularly if other products offer it. Furthermore, instead of marching forward, neglecting them would be a step backward.</div>

  <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Firstly to answer you question about placement. Koren placed each nikud and each ta'am very deliberately. Because all the nikud and ta'amim were manually placed he wasn't limited by technology. The preference was that the nikud didn't move and the ta'am was put in the correct position next to it. If it was possible to solve a collision problem by moving the nikud before and after only slightly then this was done, if not then the ta'am was moved vertically downwards (of course this is only a major problem on lower ta'amim).

Yes the weight of the ta'amim are lighter than that of the nikud. Of course the same glyph is used for both the meteg and the sof pasuk and in both cases this is a ta'am. In the siddur we treat it as nikud I guess because it has a special meaning different of the meteg and the sof pasuk (I'm not even going to talk about ga'ayas and other stress marks).

In terms of VOLT, you misunderstood what I said. Of course we are programming in a kamatz katan and shva na (and a shva nach too), however, you should know that when programming a font, the font has to be compiled. If there are too many lines in the code, the compiler cannot compile. At the moment the Koren Tanakh font with kerning, ta'amim collision preventing etc is too long and cannot be compiled. That means that the past 50 instructions that I have given to the programmer for collision avoiding cannot be put into the font. The programmer is now optimising the code so that it takes up less space and can be compiled.

I mention this because if you want a font to have grammar rules built-in it will take up even more lines of code and you won't be able to compile your font. Now to be fair, Koren is a special case typeface because it's very narrow, very very tightly kerned and therefore there are many more collisions then a typeface such as Hadasa. 

Regarding pronunciation, I think you have got quite confused between pronunciation and masora.

Traditionally the Ashkenazi Jews had their system of pronunciation of vowels where eg a kamatz is an "o" sound and Sefardim had their pronunciation system where a kamatz is an "a" sound. However, we need to differentiate between a pronunciation system and grammatical system.

I will attempt to explain and hopefully it won't get too confusing.

In Israel all Israelis, both Charedi Ashkenazim and Secular Sefardim pronounce spoken Hebrew in a system called "Israel pronunciation". That means that in the street everyone speaks more or less the same (I'm ignoring old-timer sefardim that will still pronounce the ayin and the chet).

However, those same Charedim will prayer using the Ashkenazic pronounciation system. Okay so far.

Now let's take a look at the kamatz katan. Ashkenazim of 300 years ago pronounced a kamatz katan and a kamatz gadol in the same way. There was no audible distinction. It sounded the same. The Sin and Samech was the same too etc.

However, grammatically, just because they pronounced the chet the same as the chaf, it didn't mean that they only had one letter. It just sounded the same. Grammatically Ashkenazim had a kamatz katan and a kamatz gadol but since it was written the same and spoken the same it wasn't necessarily something that a kid in cheder (sunday school) would know about.

Now, as we know the sefardim did distinguish audibly between the kamatz katan and kamatz gadol. In fact they also distinguish between the chet and the chaf, the ayin and the alef etc. Therefore the concept of a kamatz katan not only is known to sefardim but is also somehow indicated in their siddurim for pronuncation purposes.

Okay, this much we all know. But here is the kicker: the determination of what is a kamatz katan is different in the Ashkenazic tradition to that of the Sefardic tradition. The example that I gave above of the word for "afternoon" צהריים in hebrew. According to the Sefardic tradition the first kamatz is a kamatz gadol and according to Ashkenazic tradition (and incidentally according to the modern Israeli rules of pronunciation) the first kamatz is a kamatz katan. This is regardless of your pronunciation system. This is a grammatical determination.

Now this creates a question for somebody like myself publishing a siddur. Clearly when creating a sefardi siddur then the kamatz katan should be according to their traditions, ie tzahorayim (afternoon), but what about for an Ashkenazic siddur where the majority of users are going to be using modern Israeli pronunciation. 

The decision in Koren was to use Ashkenazic rulings of the determination of kamatz katan in our nusach ashkenaz and sefard (not to be confused with sefardi) siddurim and the Sefardic rulings for our Edot Mizrach siddur. We will be using the Morrocon rulings for our Morrocon siddur and Yemenite for our Yemite siddur. 

Now what do you about a Bible? Which system do you use? After all, the Bible is for everybody. Honestly I don't know! 

However, we will most likely do 3 editions, one for Ashkenazim, one for Sefardim and an edition that has neither (like we have today) which will serve clients such as the army that the users are both Ashkenazi and Sefardi. However, the jury is out on that one!

One final comment. When digitising the font we had a problem with the shva na. The enlarged shva that we created wasn't distinct enough from the regular shva. We couldn't make it any larger because we felt it would look silly, so instead we created a further character, a shva nach which was smaller than our shva so that it was distinguishable from the shva na character. Therefore our font has 3 shvas. A regular shva to be used when distinction isn't made and when we are marking it, then a shva na and a shva nach!

You are invited to see a sneak preview of the new siddur. www.korenpub.com. Click on the bottom middle icon. The new English site is still in development so we still have our old (and quite awful website) for Koren :-)

BTW the siddur pages were created with InDesign CS4 ME beta2, sorry about the heavy file, but the cool page turning is worth the wait :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Raphael, thanks for bringing your expertise to this discussion. 

As far as the question of how to mark the shva na, I have a question. In the prayerbook, of course you are going to set whatever people want. 

But as far as the Bible, the masoretic text didn't distinguish the kamatz katan or shva na, right? And the Chomsky article casts doubt on whether the grammatical rules for labeling of the shva na that come from Kimchi and seems to be generally accepted, ever really existed in spoken language. So I would think that at least for the general public it would make more sense with the Tanach just to have the all the instances of the shva the same, or to put them in as in spoken Israeli Hebrew. I have the Jerusalem Bible, published by Koren, which doesn't seem to distinguish the different kinds of schva, or the different kamatz. 

What is the general practice? Or is there one?</div>

Obviously, they would have had to sometimes pronounce the shva. Otherwise Hebrew would be unpronounceable. But the question is, how was it actually done. If I understand him rightly, Chomsky doesn't think that native speakers ever followed what are now accepted the rules of "grammar" in this area. And in fact current Hebrew speech is closer to what may have been done. 

Rafael, I wonder if for Chumashim--or for that matter siddurim--for the Conservative and Reform movements whether they'd be just as happy or happier with the rules for the shva na that now exist in spoken Hebrew. Did anyone ask them? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">> the rules for shva na as defined by the Israeli Language Institute follow the same rules of the Ashkenazic tradition.

There seems to be three sets of rules:
1) Rav Zalman Henna (Henau) - Chabad prayerbook
2) Ibn Ezra and Vilna Gaon, based on Eliahu ha-Levi(Levita) Bachur - ArtScroll prayerbook
3) Early Rishonim and Minchat Shai - Shai Lemorah books

Which one is similar to the Radak, Rabbi David Kimchi?

Do we make all the three versions in 3 OT fonts?

I don't think it would take an unreasonable amount of time to automatically compile a shva-na and kamatz katan, because it would only compile after cedrtain sequences every 15 words or more, and not every word.

The more I learn about the shva-na's relation to the kamatz katan and meteg and certain nikkud before it, depending upon its position in word, and then feasibility to access an exception table, I am convinced it can be done in about 5 routines.

I think it would be wise to offer it in 2010 or 2011, as computer processing time will make compiling delays negligible.

Anyway, the key link is the determination of a kamatz katan, which I don't see yet, or if shvana occu late in the word without a nearby meteg or kamatz katan. Maybe, then, the nikkud before it helps, as Prof.Dotan hinted.</div>

In very tight settings, couldn't the Koren OT font automatically substitute narrower nikkud and narrower taam/meteg, and insert a slight space between the letters? 

In this way, there would never be any bumping. This could be automatically performed in a "smart" OpenType font of Koren and Koren bold by programming the font correctly.

I don't think Tzika could do it.</div>

Regarding how many systems of shva na and kamatz katan. There are many many systems and many many exceptions depending on various authorities. In fact some systems don't know what to do with certain words. Trust me, we had 2 rabbinical experts on taamey mikra discussing this for months!

I have to say that I'm confused as to why you want the font to automatically put them in. It's like saying we should have autocorrect spelling in English in Minion. It *could* be done, but is that the scope of a font?

Automatic Kamatz Katan, Shva-na, and maybe Meteg
====================================

Like the furtive patach, which could repeated kerned to the right over and over (assuming that the user discovers every instance of its occurance), automatic contextual substitution and insertion is valid and useful for existing Unicode data which is lacking these glyphs.

Also, most users do not know the grammar rules calling for their placement. Automatic contextual substitution and insertion, correctly handles the correct occasions when to have one of them.

I agree with you that's not as high a priority in a wish-list, but the technology has arrived at implementing the wish-list.

As I understand your previous post, narrowing the width of nikkud and taam was considered and rejected. Maybe, because of aesthetics.

What about automatic replacement and insertion of additional space units beween the letters, while keeping the widths of vowels etc. consistant?

Please cite a word or two (book, chapter verse), and I'll post examples? The slice of space between the letters is very thin.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I understood you to start with. The idea of adding a thin slice in between letters was considered and rejected. It is much easier to program and there are lot less kerning pairs. Perhaps for a general purpose font this is a good compromise. There is another solution that we also rejected that Harbs came up with and that was to create 90% width versions of the wider letters of nikud that would be substituted when necessary to solve collisions. Again a very very good idea which visually is unnoticeable but also rejected. You have to understand the Koren is about purity of text and purity of the letters. This is why the Koren Bible is considered to be the most accurate Bible by many today. In fact, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel gave a psak din that if a klaf was unavailable for reading the Haftara, then a Koren Bible maybe used, bedieved. You don't get that level of psak for any other Bible.

We have to be perfect because we have a nearly 50-year legacy to live up to.

Regarding the rules. I'm sorry, but that's like saying, "most people can't spell so we'll fix it in the font". Actually, it's not even like that. How many people typeset Tanakhim and Humashim? Those publishing these volumes tend to have experts checking them. You are also assuming that your system of nikud is the correct one or the only one. You just can't do that. Do you have any idea how long it will take to proofread a Tanakh, get it perfect and then check the collisions? The amount of work is tremendous.

The Koren Tanakh took 10 years to proofread. We are now in the midst of digitisation and expect it to take another five years or so and once this is complete we'll have one font ready for one system of nikud (ie the Koren font with the Koren system). However, if you wanted to typeset a Tanakh with another system, then you would have to fix the font.

All I'm saying is that what you want is possible, but the real question that I ask you here on this forum as I did on the Adobe forums, is what on earth for? How much is a person going to pay for such a typeface? $10,000? And what happens if he doesn't want Vilna, but wants Hadasa? You are going to create this for each font? I just think that you don't really understand the full ramifications of what you are getting yourself in for.</div>

What is practical difference? If the goal is to maintain the position of the nikkud under the letter, and taam (and maybe meteg too) on the left side of the nikkud, then inserting a slice of space dividing one letter and next, then the collision is prevented.

But if kerning is the solution, then the nikkud and taam are tweaked, and the original intent is lost.

Plus, the kerning remains in that specific file, while the font approach travels to users of the font.</div>

This is like what I suggested to do in my OpenType fonts above.

When a sequence occurred with crashing diacritics, such as a narrow letter followed by a daled or reish, or two narrow letters in a row, then there is not enough room for the two sets of diacritics with having them bump.

If the OpenType font would be programmed to automatically replace the regular width diacritics with a narrower set, then they would not bump.

Although this in deed an honor, but according to Jewish law, any Bible text could be read for the Haftorah, even if it was printed on newsprint (used to print pornographic literature), using a font by a person who desecrated the Sabbath, and typeset by a person who believed in Yoshkie.

It in deed in a compliment, but it is very limited.

><cite>We have to be perfect because we have a nearly 50-year legacy to live up to.</cite>

Great Hebrew typography existed in Vilna, Lithuania more than a hundred years before Eliyahu Koren could read. Even greater Hebrew typography existed earlier in Europe, as the book on the history of the printing of the Talmud shows.

With the advent of OpenType, Hebrew typography greater that what KJoren produced s possible.

Your example of the Koren prayerbook is in deed beautiful, as you are asuperb typesetter.

Scott-Martin Kesofsky of the Philidor Company is creating an even more beautiful Machzor (with many grammar features too) for the Rabbinic Assembly.

I am working on another beautiful prayerbook for Nusach Ari (Chabad), featuring the pagination of the old Kehot siddur, and the beautiful prayerbook for Nusach Ashkenaz and Nusach Sefard, featuring the pagination of the widely popular ArtScroll siddur and the longest used Tikun Meir prayerbook, featuring the Vilna/Romm typefaces.

You are in deed doing a great thing, and I wish you much success.

But the Koren Tanach is not the only popular and beautiful Jewish Bible. In the next five to ten years, there will be many many competitors.

Many people outside of Israel think that it leaves much to be desired. If you didn't have a vested interest in its success, as a professional Hebrew typesetter would you be tooting its horn so much? I think not.</div>

You don't seem to understand. My goal is create a new standard for good quality Hebrew fonts, by using the current OpenType technology.

As a result, Hebrew publishing will look great, and Hebrew grammar will be understood and practiced by a significant percentage of educated Jews in the next generation. Maybe, even Israelis will pronounce correctly. : )</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Firstly thank you for the compliment.

Secondly, your prices are great! If indeed you can produce them such that these prices work for you then they work for me too :-)

Thirdly, the kerning and the nikud positioning all work in the font. We are currently redoing our maps in Illustrator, and the teamim and kerning all work perfectly there too.

Finally regarding reading the haftara from a klaf. I am not a Rav, but I suspect that this psak halacha wasn't given out meaninglessly to give a compliment. However, this is out of my sphere of knowledge. I just know about the psak :-)


I am not saying that Koren is the most beautiful font or the best font. I'm saying that it's the Koren font that I'm revitalising and digitising and it needs to meet the exacting standards that Eliyahu Koren had in his original metal font that's all. This  is in no way a reflection of other typefaces. I'm comparing the Koren Tanakh font of the 21st century to that of the 20th. That's all. I don't dismiss the ideas of solving collisions with thin spaces or fractional nikud lightly. They were considered and played with at length. It just didn't work for us. That doesn't mean to say that it wouldn't work in other typefaces, indeed I would have preferred it if had worked in Koren since the route we are taking is extremely time-consuming and expensive :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">><cite>Finally regarding reading the haftara from a klaf.</cite>

In America, we use a printed book.

I heard that some (in Israel) have a klaf-like roll, and I've seen some synogogues that have them, as it was once in use here as well.

Originally, the haftorah was read, because Torah reading was banned. Haftorah is from the various books of Prophets, known as Nevi'im. That's why certain Haftorah verses mimick themes in the weekly Torah portion.


There is a third approach to avoid colliding which is extremely attractive, and automatic.

Scott-Martin Kesofsky created very slightly wider versions of the narrow letters, and slightly narrower nikkud, thinner and thus even narrower taam, and a very thin meteg in his Milon typeface. The differences are very subtle, that only a good typographer with a keen eye could notice.

I have not seen a better living Hebrew typesetter than him (you're very good, but he's superb). I told Scott that it's because that he caters to the high end, like you (but his high end is much higher!), while I have customers that think use of white space is a waste of paper, and good typography is "cram it in".</div>

I am aware of the third approach that you suggest. We tried it with Koren and it didn't work. Again, Koren has very very high standards (higher than the standards of my clients) and the subtlely ruined the flow of the font.

I would love to see some examples of Scott. I am always looking to people that I can aspire to. I have learnt a tremendous amount in the past 1.5 years at Koren and am always looking to improve my appreciation of typography.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Btw, I created two sets of nikkud/taam/meteg alignment. One traditional, and one "modern", like Eliyahu Koren's system.

Scott is using Koren's system.

Traditional means that the nikkud/taam/meteg combination is viewed as a single unit, and centered under the letter, unless that letter is a daled, kuf, or reish.

Modern means only the nikkud is centered. The nikkud is dominant in weight and width, the taam is secondary, and the meteg is thinner than the taam and positioned on a lower level than it.

The modern approach poses difficulties under narrow letters, especially followed by a reish (or someyimes daled).

There is a great advantage in teach children to read by following the modern approach, which Koren either innovated or popularized.

The traditional approach though is most popular in America and by many, if not most, frum Jews. That's what they are used to seeing. I am a pragmatic idealist, so as they say here, "the customer is always right".

But on the GoHebrew web site (under construction), a section is devoted to displaying the Bible, with dark blue nikkud, dark red taamim, and dark green meteg, following Koren's alignment system.

Adil Allawi of Ready Set Go International in London showed me a CD his company made for the Saudi govt.'s Dept. of Education an electronic Koran, that color-coded the diacritics, hyper-linked each verse to a translation, and different words or phrases in verses to explanations. By clicking on them, windows popped up featuring translations or explanations. He advised to do the same for the Bible and the Talmud.

I am working on making a fascinating electronic Talmud, which will include the entire body of Jewish knowledge, including the Tanach, the Jewish Bible at www.gotalmud.org.

Why don't you partipate there, and describe what you are doing with the 21st century Koren Bible, and why it is significant.</div>

If you look at early manuscripts, you will see that the scribes did the nikud and teamim in the way that Koren did (actually the other way round, Koren copied the manuscripts). 

Therefore, from my understanding the Koren system is the traditional system which makes sense since the nikud is secondary to the letters and the taamim tertiary.</div>

I am finalizing the list of GPOS rountines during these days, which will determine positioning of nikkud, taam, and meteg. I can program them to fall exactly where I want them under each letter, without kerning.

If it is in deed only one system of alignment which Eliyahu Koren mimicked from early manuscripts, then I would only implement that.

I think for educational purposes (and logic dictates it), the nikkud should fall under the letter and be the most prominant compared to the taam and meteg.

The taam should be positioned on the nikkud's left, and be thinner, and positioned a little lower than the nikkud.

The meteg should be positioned on the taam's left, and be thinner, and positioned a little lower than the taam.

I think the insertion of a slice of space is preferred to juggling the taam etc. The consistant order of the nikkud, taam, and meteg, is more important that the fac that letters are spaced farther apart when required that consitant inner-letter spacing.

If there is no significant decrease in the readability of the nikkud, taam, and meteg combinations, then perhaps replacement of them for narrower versions is preferable to insertion of slices of space.

[Please tell Harb's there is a sha'a'lah of ha-sag-gat g'vul in trying to sell ME products over the Internet when he is only legally permitted to sell in Israel? Tell him to ask Rabbi Elyashev Shlita. Even according to secular laws.]

I don't understand.

Jewish Bible typography always have this typographical heirarchy.

There are certain Christian Bible scholars who insert the meteg before the taam. I never heard that any Jewish Bible scholars do this.

According to my poor understanding, the invention of the meteg symbol occurred after the invention of the taam symbols.

Plus, the meteg with only nikkud serves a different function that the meteg with both nikkud and taam.

The meteg with prayer, Mishnaic, poetry, children's text, or Ivrit Kalah, serves as an accent mark, to indicated which word in a sentence to stress.

In Tanach, it indicates something else. I admit, I don't understand what it is.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">1. I don't have any scans off-hand. I'm sure googling will give you evidence. Remember you are the one contending x without any basis. Can I see some basis for your assertion?

2. I am not using kerning to position the taamim. I am using kerning to make sure that the nun and the yud are closer together etc.

3. I respect your opinion of adding thin spaces between the letters instead of moving the taamim, however, I believe that this is coming from a programmer's point of view and not a typographer's. After all, why do we have fi and ffi ligatures? Why didn't we just add a thin slice of space in between? I think it decreases legibility.

4. Again, I'm not convinced about the narrower versions either for the same reason, but I am more open to that option.

5. I will most certainly not tell Harbs anything of the sort. You clearly have no idea who he is, what his relationship with Adobe is and what his relationship with HaKadosh Baruch Hu is (lehavdil). I request that you keep such comments off this forum, they are highly inappropiate.

6. Yes you are very confused about the meteg on all levels. I'm not sure how you are programming it if you don't understand it. I will explain briefly, because I have explained it already on this thread, if you need more information e-mail me off-list.

a. The meteg is a taam. It's purpose is secondary stress. It has the same weight as all other taamim. It is not secondary to the taamim. It is a taam.

b. The sof pasuk (siluk) is a taam. It's purpose is primary stress. It also has the same weight as all the other taamim.

c. The visual appearance of both these taamim are exactly the same even though they have a completely different purpose. In Unicode, they also have the exact same value (although IMHO this is incorrect).

d. For 100s of years, the meteg has been "incorrectly" used in Siddurim to indicate primary stress on a word that is not accented on the last syllable. This is known grammatically as "mileil" as opposed to "milra". The thinking was that we tell the reader to pronounce all words as milra (ie stress on last syllable) unless we put a meteg under a different syllable. Eg MElekh. Here there would be a meteg under the first syllable. However, the only time that a meteg would appear under the first syllable in the Tanakh, would be if it was the last word in the sentence, ie a sof pasuk. In this situation, the weight of the meteg has no consequence since it isn't part of the Hebrew grammar but rather a made up sign. It's like saying that a kamatz katan should be heavier than a kamatz gadol. It's nonsense. We only make the kamatz katan larger as an educutional tool. Therefore you might as well keep the meteg used in this situation as the weight of the meteg of the taamey mikra and then you can use the same unicode character. I should point out that in Rinat Yisrael, they use a zarka for words that are commonly mispronounced as mileil and an ole for words commonly mispronounced as milra. There they don't use a meteg at all.

I hope this clears a few things up.</div>

Thank you for your clarifications regarding meteg. I must think about it.

There practical use outside Israel by most readers of Hebrew may override your view.

Either it's like the sayings of "bring a horse to water" or "fighting city hall", you might be right, but "that's is the way it's done".

I'm still weighing which is better to avoid bumping:
a) adding a thin slice of space
b) substituting narrow taam (and meteg)
c) substituting somewhat-wider narrow letters

[About harbs, that is why I wrote hasagat gvul in Hebrew. ME products are not licensed from Adobe, but distributors license from Winsoft. Resellers like harbs purchase from distributors. Violations are treated very seriously, especially from competitors.]

If you are not kerning, or tweaking the glyphs, and reject the above-mentioned three choices, what are you doing? Is it Koren Bible specific?

Thank you Raphael for your supportive words.

For those who don't know what Israel is talking about, [[http://www.in-tools.com|my website]] sells Adobe ME software to the US and Europe. Israel does not in fact know our arrangements with either Adobe or Winsoft. I'm sure that he would not make these statements if he did. We do have written permission from Winsoft to sell ME software to most countries world-wide (with the exception of Middle Eastern states). This includes both boxed versions and site licenses.

		<div class="commentbody">harbs,

Thank you for joining this discussion. As a knowledgeable person in Hebrew books, I am certain that you will have valuable comments to offer to benefit all its readers.

Regarding the status of your web site, perhaps you are right, and I am wrong. If that is true, then not only do I owe you an apology and must ask you forgiveness, but I should also declare here in this forum, in "public" my error and your validity.

However, I believe though this is not incorrect. I'll tell you why:

1. No distributor or reseller has the right to infringe upon another authorirized distributor's or reseller's territory. Are you a VAR (Value Added Reseller)? This seems not true, as the plug-ins you sell are priced very low, and they are only a non-essential add-on feature, not an essential componant of the InDesign ME software.

At Apple Computer Inc., I had an arrangement in writing with Apple as a VAR. However, even there I was obligated to compensate the local reseller for every sale. Why would this logical arrangement be rescinded for you by Adobe or WinSoft?

2. Adobe, to my knowledge, only signs a master license to Winsoft, not to individual resellers. You are claiming Adobe made an exception to you. This is unlikely.

3. Winsoft respects territorial rights, like most manufacturers, and prohibits a reseller from one country to sell outside his or her territory. You are claiming Adobe made an exception to you. By doing so, you are given an unfair advantage over  every reseller except of course WinSoft's online store.

If you may sell worldwide over the Internet, why can't other resellers, as your plug-ins are a separate low-cost item? Couldn't you sell the plug-ins worldwide, but adhere to WinSoft's standard arrangements?

If this is in deed true, why is a special consideration given to you? Why does WinSoft or printisrael.com post a notice refering to this special status?

So, for these reasons, I don't believe (with all due respect to your Torah knowledge) you are correct, until I see written proof otherwise.

Your web site is in deed attractive, with the exception of a blurry Adobe logo. I'm sure Adobe would provide you with a higher resolution logo, if you in deed have a direct business relationship with them.

I really hope that you prove me wrong, because otherwise this act is totally unjustified and can have very harmful results.</div>

As far as the main discussion goes, my views closely coincide with those of Raphael (although he's somewhat more of a purist).

As Raphael already stated, this is not the forum to discuss the issue. However you insist on continuing this, so I will indulge you once more <strong>and only once more</strong>. You have just accused me of being an outright liar on a public forum. This is not becoming of you at all...

1) I don't recall discussing with you whether or not I'm a VAR. If that's pertinent, it's up to Winsoft to decide -- not you. If you believe it's important, you can also feel free to ask Raphael his opinion on whether I offer value-added services or not.

2) I did not mention Adobe at all in conjunction with the ME versions.

3) There is clear distinction between resellers and distributors. What you are referring to about territorial rights is true for distributors. You are not classified as a distributor (although I'm sure you'd like to...) any more than I am.

The fact that Winsoft issues site licenses through us should be enough indication that I am in fact dealing with them directly. They know exactly what's on my website and what's not, as well as what/how I sell the products. I don't feel any need to justify myself to you any more than you should feel a need to justify yourself to me. I will not respond to these requests to divulge information which has nothing to do with you either here or in the spam you've been sending me through my website. I will be happy to respond to any reasonable request or question. <strong>Threatening me if I don't disclose private information is not what I consider reasonable...</strong>

If you have trouble accepting what I'm saying feel free to ask Caroline Hourregue of Winsoft. This discussion is already far out of line, and I will not continue to discuss this further on a public forum, say what you may. If you believe I conduct unfair competition and would like to try to have my rights to sell ME product revoked by Winsoft, feel free to discuss this with them. <strong>None of this entitles you to spam this forum.</strong>

To be totally straight with you, our sales volume is not great enough for you to even bother wasting you time trying to discredit me. You will only end up harming yourself.

P.S. Do you really think I'd use the Adobe Partner logo illegally? I would have thought that even you would give me more credit than that. The Partner Logo that you see on my website is in fact the official one given to me by Adobe. I am actually happy that you made this gross accusation because it made me realize that my plugins fell off the plugin list on Adobe's site when it was updated for CS4. It might have taken me months to realize this...

Best regards,
Harbs</div>

Thank you for your candid and revealing response. I am sorry that you respond with much emotion. My goal is not to hurt you at all for any legitimate business activity, ha'lee'la.

Let's remove this discussion from a public forum, but allow me please to reply to certain remarks you made about my words.

Harbs: <cite>You have just accused me of being an outright liar on a public forum.</cite>

I did not accuse you of this. I simply seek written verification.

1. VAR - I never discussed your status as a VAR. I referred to my status as an authorized VAR for Apple. At that time, Apple did not award worldwide rights to a VAR. So, I was surprized if Adobe would.

2. Adobe
Harbs: <cite>I did not mention Adobe at all in conjunction with the ME versions.</cite>

Harbs: <cite>Israel does not in fact know our arrangements with either Adobe or Winsoft.</cite>

3. Are resellers more enpowered than distributors?

Harbs: <cite>There is clear distinction between resellers and distributors. What you are referring to about territorial rights is true for distributors.</cite>

Please verify this. This is not WinSoft's definition in all other countries.

Harbs: <cite>The fact that Winsoft issues site licenses through us should be enough indication that I am in fact dealing with them directly.</cite>

A site license does not imply permission is granted to sell outside one's territory. Do you think it does? Can you verify this?

Harbs: <cite>They know exactly what’s on my website and what’s not, as well as what/how I sell the products.</cite>

This implies that "shtika zu ho'da'ah" - silence implies consent. In secular law, this alone is not sufficient.

Harbs: <cite>Do you really think I’d use the Adobe Partner logo illegally?</cite>

I never accused you of this. I merely said that it's blurry.

After you are calm and think clearly, let's discuss how we can work together, clarify this, and put it behind us.

Does your firm make custom plug-ins, too? I work at a sister company at www.gotalmud.org, and that entity seeks to automate production of the Talmud. Perhaps, your plug-ins can help achieve this goal?

Headed by a highly respected scholar and commentator, Rabbi Shmuel Yehuda Winefeld Shlita, he has completed marking the entire Pentateuch (Torah, Five Books of Moses, Chumash) with shva-na symbols. Interestingly, not one of them interfere with the upper taamim markings.

Shay Lemora determines placement of the shva-na symbols based upon the rules of the early Rabbinic authorities and the Minchat Shai.

"Kehot" (Karnei Hod Torah - the Rays of the Glory of the Torah), the largest Jewish publisher and the official publishing house of the Chabad-Lubavitch organisation. 

Kehot determines placement of the shva-na symbols differently than Shay Lemora, according to the system of Rav Zalman Henna (Hanau).


A third system is used by ArtScroll, another large Jewish publisher, based upon the writings of Ibn Ezra and the Vilna Gaon. According to Prof. Aron Dotan of Tel Aviv University, the Vilna Gaon's system was derived from Rabbi Eliyahu Bachur, an early Rabbinic authority.

Prof. William Chomsky defines the Ramchal's (Rabbi David Kimchi) definition of shva-na similar to Rabbi Eliyahu Bachur's system. 


Apparently, Rav Henna's system was the last. However, if we view the Vilna Gaon's system as being final, it is last. But, if we consider the system used by Kehot, as it is current, it in deed is last.

According to Judaism, the final valid viewpoint determines which way is to be followed, as scholars considered all the previous viewpoints and made a lasting determination to be followed.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah ha! Didn't I tell you, Israel, at the beginning of this that the concern with grammar was a rationalist thing, and you probably wouldn't find satisfaction about it in the mystical and Chassidic tradition? 

As to different systems coming from Radak, according to William Chomsky, the idea of long and short vowels came from David Kimchi's father, and was developed by him. It is so complex (and questionable), from what I have seen, that I'm not surprised that a lot of issues were yet to be figured out. Radak was a follower of Maimonides, not of the mystics who subsequently rebelled against Maimonides' rationalist views and created the Kabbalah. 

By the way an interesting--to me anyway--side light on this is that IIRC Noam Chomsky, son of William, started his linguistic studies with Hebrew grammar, and that was one influence that eventually led him to develop his famous theory of "transformational generative grammar" that he claims underlays all languages. When you see how the Radak rules are brief, but hooked to others that then become recursively a more and more complex system, you can see the influence on Noam Chomsky in the development of his ideas.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I spoke to a great Hebrew grammar expert, Rabbi Shmuel Rabin, of Toronto, Canada, author of a remarkable treatise on chanting aloud the Scroll of Esther. He inserted in all the correct places, the shva-na, according to the system of Rav Zalman Henna.

I asked him whether Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liady, the first Lubavitcher Rebbe, prefered Rav Henna's system over the others popularized by Rabbi Yaakov Emben, Minchat Shai, based upon the writing of the Radak, Rabbi David Kimchi.

Rsbbi Rabin clarified that the popular Lubavitcher prayerbook, <cite>Tehillat Hashem</cite>, first introduced to the Lubavitcher community the appearance of the shva-na. Rabbi Shneur Zalman's own rendition of the prayerbook did not mark them.

Rabin explained that the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe greatly expanded the <cite>Tehillat Hashem</cite> prayerbook by inserting copies of pages from the <cite>Seder Avodah</cite> prayerbook, which marked the shva-na according to the system of Rav Henna. The editor of the <cite>Tehillat Hashem</cite>, the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, was accustomed not to change things for no special reason.

As proof of this, Kehot of Israel retypeset their prayerbook like the view of the Minchat Shai and others, while Kehot of the US follows the old Kehot prayerbook exactly, i.e. Rav Henna's system of defining the shva-na.

Rabin said that Henna's system was more complicated, and like Minchat Shai, originated with the Radak (Kimchi). 

He also believes it is possible to determine shva-na, if rules can be made first for a kamatz katan which precedes a shva, recognition or placement of the meteg (used differently if there's taamim or not), but it will require much time and effort to sort out. So, both experts in Hebrew grammar, Prof. Dotan and Rabbi Rabin, agree that it is possible. Rabin warns that this is very difficult accord to Rav Henna's system.

Although Rabin is a Hebrew grammar expert, he explained that the view of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement is to degrade the emphasis on Hebrew grammar. He quote the fifth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Sholem Dovber, in the latter's book, <cite>Torat Shalom</cite>, regarding the importance of correct pronunciation, based upon the rules of Hebrew grammar, in prayer. 

Rabbi Sholem Dovber said it's far more important to pronounce the words correctly in general, to understand the meaning of the words, and to pray with a sincere and broken heart. For this reason, the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe was heard when he payed out loud as the <cite</cite>chazan</cite>, the שליח ציבור, "lit. leader of the congregation", to emphasize chanting in a sing-song manner, and heart-felt feelings, and to ignore issues of Hebrew grammar, even though he was well versed in them from childhood.

This is consistant with the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of the Chassidic movement, that G-d wants the heart, that prayer is measured more by intentions and feelings, and less by rules and regulations.

Regarding Kimchi's rules of Hebrew grammar, how could two different systems come out of Kimchi's writings?

What's the "ah ha"?

Chabad is the rational branch of Chassidism.

The mystical tradition is only meaningful when it's understood, ie. rational.

The founder of Lubavitch, Rabbi Shneur Zalman, emphasized the importance of Hebrew grammar. The seventh L. Rebbe was taught Hebrew grammar by a secular Jew as a child, hired by his parents, who felt that this subject was important enough to hire the teacher as a tutor. Later, that tweacher became the Minister of Education in the State of Israel.</div>

What are you trying to say? What is "questionable"?


><cite>Radak was a follower of Maimonides, not of the mystics who subsequently rebelled against Maimonides’ rationalist views and created the Kabbalah.</cite> 

There were some who dismissed or argued Maimonides' views. Within one genertion all opposition disappeared.

Your conclusion is incorrect. Even today, the Sephardic community considers Maimonides the ultimate master, adhering to his Halachic rulings in "Mishnah Torah". Sephardim are generally more inclined to mysticism than Askenazim. Ashkenazim do not derive Halachic rulings directly from Maimonides, but rather from Rema, Vilna Gaon, Mishna Brura, or Rabbi Moses Feinstein.

The seventh L. Rebbe points out that Maimonides was in deed a mystic, as he began his introduction with a four letter acronym for G-d's holy name, a gesture of the mystics.

As to 'questionable', I am just repeating what I said before: according to to my reading of the W. Chomsky article on the schva, it seems that it it doubtful whether the distinction between long and short vowels, which was key to the Kimchi system, ever existed until them, and according to Chomsky it does not in modern spoken Hebrew. But I am a novice at all this, and I may not be reading him rightly.  </div>

No, I didn't yet. 

R. Rabin advised that Hanau's system is more difficult, but not impossible. He said that I have to consider much more details andsort them out.

He also said that in nikkud only text, the position of the meteg is critical, but in Biblical it is a secondary stress mark, and one of the taamim is primary.

I'm thinking that he should place shva-na symbols according to Hanau in the Psalms that have taamim. Then, I would write my set of GSUB routines around it, and again in a second OT font, an alternate set of GSUB routines based on the prayerbook.</div>

More rules to follow, producing more shva-nas. I don't know yet, but I think his understanding of Kimchi's views on shva-na will help me. So says my gut. It;s either that, or I'm hungry!:)

It sells very well every year. אין קמח, אין תורה - If there is no flour, there can be no Torah.

R. Rabin is a professional proof-reader, as well as a Hebrew grammar wizard. I figure that the Psalms is a doable prject within a year. I believe Kehot will license it.</div>

As you know, the mishnah in Avot says it both ways. Among the many different interpretations we say that in the way that you quote, learning Torah is necessary in order to earn money. Likewise, in the way I quoted, earning money is necessary in order to learn Torah. This is the traditional understanding.

Please spell out your different understanding.

I was telling David that I chose Psalms for practical reasons.

1. It's much shorter than the entire Bible. 
2. As a result, it costs far less in proof-reading, 
3. in typesetting, 
4. in printing and binding, 
5. and it's relatively higher in sales. 

Hence, it's a good investment to get the OpenType programming done as well. 

Plus, no Psalms to date that I know has these symbols.</div>

I didn't know that. Thank you for sharing.

In the US, an established publisher of Hebrew books was the now defunct Hebrew Publishing Company. In fact, after WWII, HPC was the world's largest Jewish publisher.

They gained fame and fortune by reprinting all the classic Jewish books, even retypsetting some of them.

Among their vast array of books, they reprinted a very clear book of Psalms originally printed in Vilna, Lithuania.

The Chabad-Lubavitch organisation in the late forties purchased the exclusive print rights from them, even though it was likely public domain, because the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe chose it.

In fact, the seventh Lubavitch refused to allow it to be retypeset, because his father-in-law looked into it.  !?!

I wanted to retypeset it and asked Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky (now the head of this worldwide movement), argueing that I would create a custom from this edition of the Psalms. He order the Lubavitch Library to photocopy every single page of the personal book of Psalms which the sixth L. Rebbe actually used every day.

When I began, I ran into a problem that the Psalms that most publishers offered (including Koren) featured different taamim (and in a couple places even nikkud) than those in this book of Psalms used by over one hundred thousand Lubavitchers.

Do you know about different opinions to place taamim in Psalms? Since we no longer know how to chant the Psalms, who is to say which one is right?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I really am not trying to encode grammar, which rules based upon woed and sentence structure.

That is the realm or the teacher and the scholar.

I am expanding the Unicode Hebrew standard to include all graphic symbols that are used in Hebrew, and those that do not earn a Unicode to include them in my fonts, such as a folded lamed or ayin, a truncated final nuhn or final chof (do you know what that is?),a set of shva-na symbols, or the hataf kamatz katan (soon to be widely used - he, he).

What I want to do, which Prof. Dotan and Rabbi Rabin, think can be done, is to create a kind contextual analysis to insert a kamatz katan, maybe meteg, and shva-na like John Hudson's (fairly easy) furtive patach (that Jewish publishers never did before Koren).

It's not grammar. It contual analysis.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, but that is my point. With the furtive patach, you can encode it (if people actually want it is another question), but I still don't see how you are going to even encode the kamatz katan. Even with our siddur we have made editorial decisions as to what is a kamatz katan or not based on various sources and changed our minds. How are you going to allow a person what to do?

I always cite the easy example of the Hebrew word for afternoon which the first kamatz is katan according to sefardim and gadol according to ashkenazim (and that's an easy one). You have yet to address this problem.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would make all the different forms of kamataz katan. People can chose which glyph they want.

Chocalate for chocalate lovers; vanilla for vanilla lovers; and even strawberry for those daring type.

If a GSUB routine can be written whereby ordinary kamatzes will be selectively replaced with one form of kataz katan, then so it shall be.

I then make three nearly identical versions of the font, each with a different default. If you pay extra, you get chocalate. If you pay extra, you get vanilla.

About kamatz katan for Ashkenazim, I was told by Israel-based kollel Hemdat HaAretz (the halachic decider for the OU) that even for them it is an issue, just not in recognizable pronunciation.

I think they mean on how it impacts the shva-na.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott is truly an artist, type designer, typographer, and author. He should do more.

His Machzor for the Conservative movement, and Siddur for the Reform, should be a prelude and taste of an effort for the Orthodox, starting with Chabad.

Except for Chabad, it should embrace every aspect of Jewish prayer throughout the year, and throughout the life of a Jew. 

===

See www.gotalmud.com. It will be finished after the summer with www.gohebrew.com, and www.goworld.com.

I asked Scott to assist me to design and layout Dr. Elie Wiesel's introduction.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Raphael,

I saw your beautiful Koren Siddur on Shabbos at Rabbi Orman's (Shlita) Talmud class at Ave I and Coney Island Avenue - by the Young Israel.

I think some parts were recreated to reduce the page count, and makes those tightened sections not pleasing to the eye, as is stated in Hebrew.

After careful and attentive review, I am confince that the great Mr. E. Koren's magnificent face is not suited for prayer.
 
GoHebrew calls it "Crown", due to its sound and loftiness. I subjected it to US Copyright at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, and to a design patent there also. After a long correspondance, the director of the Copyright Office conceded that it indeed was subject to copyright, in a landmark decision, which led to Adobe's successful yection repeatedly from NY.

I do not believe that Koren Publishing has submitted a copyright application, nor registered a trademark in the US. This is a gross oversight by Mr. Miller.</div>

Ask any sofer stam scribe.

Eliyahu Koren is based rather heavily upon an Ashkenazic influence ancient design, while the classic Romm family Vilna fat design, like Bodoni Poster, is based direcly upon super ancient Sephardic Bible drawings shown to Bodoni's students by Mr. Romm senior, as reported by Frederick Goudy (?) in his thin book. This suggest that this design is better suited for study as well.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi David,

Long time, no talk.

I still believe the automatic replacement of the shvah-nah with a shvah-nach is doable, as are other glyphs as well.

But there appears to be three systems from the Ramak's teachings:
1) Rabbi Zalman Hanau used Chabad USA
2) Eliyahu Bachur/the Vilna Gaon used by ArtScroll
3) Michat Shai used by Chabad Israel and Shai L'morah

Do you still think it is impossible to implement in Volt, or do you agree now that it is possible to create a set of contextual rules that do not use grammar rules, but reather the results of applied grammar.

Consider yourself lucky: the new lectionaries here in Italy, after the new CEI translation of the Bible, are set in – take a deep breath – Officina Bold.
I think that not even Erik Spiekermann would be happy about that. :(

And the first editions of the new bible are useless as bad as they are typeset, if you seek the appropriate reading comfort for prayer or meditation…

		<div class="commentbody">A very old design is called "Rashi".

Rashi is an acronym for Ra-Shlomo-Ishaki, a great medieval Torah scholar. Rashi composed the great commentaries on the Bible and the Talmud, that have never been surpassed to this very day.

Tradition has it that his birth was miraculous, and he was sent to this world by G-d to compose these two tremendous commentaries.

At the time, or shortly thereafter, the rabbis insisted that the Bible and the core of the Talmud should be ;resented differently than the commentaries. The Bible and the Talmud were drawn or typeset in square letters like Romm Vilna square letters by the Sephardic Jews or like the original source of Koren square letters by the Ashkenazic Jews, and the commentaries round narrow like Rashi round letters by the Ashkenazic Jews or like the unnamed round letters by the Sephardic Jews, as seen in the Dead Sea Scrolls (Go Hebrew calls Rambam, after Maimonides).
