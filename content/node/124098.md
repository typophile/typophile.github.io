  body: "A font resident in the printer that does not necessarily correspond exactly
    to a digital font. Note from the angled and curved strokes that the font consists
    of a series of dots, which means that it is bit-mapped rather than digital outlines.\r\nThe
    rounded _A_ is found in Sancoale http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/sancoale/
    but the other letters and numbers don't match.\r\nNumbers are similar to Soin
    Sans [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SoinsansNumbers_3467.gif] http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stawix/soin-sans-pro/\r\nMost
    letters are similar to Titling Gothic FB\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TitlingGothicAsDATEIN_5349.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/TitlingGothicAsTIMEOUT_5852.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/TitlingGothicAsJOBCODE_4166.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/titling-gothic-fb/\r\nDon"
