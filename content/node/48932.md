body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nIm including some MATLAB plots in a LaTeX document and have used
  the psfrag package to (successfully) assimilate the axis labels and title with the
  font in my LaTeX document.  What I'm wondering is whether there's a simple way to
  do the same for the axis scale labels (ie. the numbers that accompany the ticks
  along each axis).  I can use psfrag to manually replace each and every one, although
  its incredibly cumbersome.\r\n\r\nIs there a better way?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "I just noticed a second problem - I've been using LaTeX -> PS -> PDF on a
    Windows machine.  I've just been viewing the PS in GSView and using its 'Extract'
    option and 'pdfwrite' to convert the file to a PDF.  I didn't even notice at first
    - it was exaggerated on printing - but the font colour inside the PDF isnt actually
    black, but rather a dark grey.  Printing directly from GSView is fine, but conversion
    to PDF leaves the font this dark grey colour which, on printing (from the PDF),
    looks rather bad.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nAs far as the plots go, it might be an idea to use gnuplot instead
    of MATLAB, and use the epslatex option terminal to produce the output, which renders
    all text (including number on the axis) natively in LaTeX.\r\n\r\nAs for the PDF
    conversion, your LaTeX distribution might have come with pdflatex, which converts
    latex directly to PDF. Are you using MiKTeX? You might also look at http://www.toolscenter.org/
    for a pretty good IDE that should automate the process for you.\r\n\r\nI hope
    this is useful."

  body: "Thanks for the reply, but it has to be MATLAB for reasons there isn't much
    point in going into.\r\n\r\nI do have pdfLaTeX but had to go from LaTeX -> PS
    first because pdfLaTeX couldnt handle including the .eps file."

    command epstopdf to get graphicname.pdf from graphicname.eps; with the graphicx
    package, pdflatex can then handle it with \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{graphicname}
    (or you choose the width you want). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Well, if I do that I have to manually edit everything I want to embed, I have
    to know the exact size it'll be once I insert it since scaling the image will
    scale the labels and any time I want to change the labels I'll need to edit the
    image (as apposed to just the TeX file).  I just wanna know why ps2pdf is giving
    me grey font output :/

    can't answer that question That is something that has never occurred to me and
    that I find quite surprising. And if you have lots of graphics to handle, using
    a graphics editor may indeed not be a viable solution. Sorry."

  body: Just used the online ps2pdf converter and it worked fine :/  For some reason
    when I use ps2pdf on my PC I get a really dark grey (so dark you cant notice in
    the PDF without zooming in a ridiculous amount), but it becomes really obvious
    when I print (on my B&W laser), since it uses a fine pattern to try and emulate
    the gray colour... It ends up looking like my toner is running out.

  body: Found the culprit... psfrag requires the color package, and for some reason
    just using the color package is whats causing the final pdf to have this dark
    grey font... weird.  Not sure whether its a bug or some genius decided that grey
    so dark its almost indistinguishable was just a good default font color.. but
    the option 'monochrome' fixes it.
