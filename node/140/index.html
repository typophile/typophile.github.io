Supposedly, anyway. <BR> <BR>On a different note, cursive arose naturally out of the need for Europe&#39;s literate &#40;mostly nobles and members of the clergy&#41; to write quickly and legibly. I&#39;m sure that literate and educated Americans will always be able to write cursive; the question is, how much of the population will be literate and educated in 10/50 years? &#40;some would argue the majority of graduates these days  are neither.&#41; <BR> <BR>Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What kind of cursive? <BR> <BR>When I came to Canada as a schoolboy I was surprised to discover -- and knew enough about calligraphy from my mother to be think it weird -- that kids were being taught to write copperplate style with ballpoint pens. I&#39;d come from a school in Wales where ballpoint pens were forbidden, and where a neat Fairbanks italic running hand was taught. In Canada, it seemed incredibly perverse that kids were learning a style of writing developed specifically for a split-nibbed pen. Thankfully, my teacher was content to let me continue using my messy fountain pens and running hand, although it never improved very much and I gradually dropped most of the connecting strokes and became a type designer.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#34;Cursive&#34; means a connecting, slanted, script. You can generally write complete words without picking up your pen &#40;except to cross t&#39;s and dot i&#39;s&#41;. I think the idea is &#40;was&#41; that you can write faster that way. <BR> <BR>I was taught some form of cursive in grade school back in the sixties. I was never very good at it and switched to unconnected &#34;printing&#34; by high school &#40;forever preserved in a certain font of mine&#41;. I do tend to connect certain runs of letters when I&#39;m in a hurry. My handwriting is generally more forward slanting now than when I did the font over ten years ago. <BR> <BR>My mother was taught the Palmer Method and has beautiful handwriting. I have her old Palmer instruction books. It looks very rigorous to learn. <BR> <BR>My daughter &#40;9&#41; is learning &#34;Denealian&#34; handwriting which is a kind of unconnected sloping style with some cursive-like forms. Much closer to calligraphy than cursive.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The impression I get from some of the comments on this thread, particularly Tim Drabant&#39;s regarding uppercase letters, is that &#39;cursive&#39; in the context of American education means a <i>particular</i> kind of &#39;connecting, slanted, script&#39;. I&#39;m wondering if this is the same as the copperplate-derived script I referred to earlier, which Canadian kids were learning in the late 1970s? <BR> <BR>The italic hand I learned in Wales was also cursive -- connecting, slanted -- but was a very different thing to the copperplate style. In Britain there was a huge reaction against the copperplate style in the early 20th century, expressed in a renaissance of the italic hand promoted by Alfred Fairbanks, and copperplate had completely vanished by the time I was born. It was strange to come to North America and find kids writing an 18th century split steel nib script with ballpoint pens.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was required to learn to write something that resembled what people are calling cursive in England in the 1970s. I seem to remember having to copy letters out in something called &#34;Vere Foster&#39;s Copy Book&#34;. It was, as it happens, a Catholic school. I was bad at it, and I hated it, and I thought &#40;and still think&#41; that the resulting writing is pretty ugly &#40;f, s, z especially, and the fussy capitals&#41; ... but not as ugly as the dreadful &#34;bubble writing&#34; most people now produce. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I do think that most writing now is pretty undistinguished; it often seems childish. <BR> <BR>I agree that the ballpoint pen is to blame for much ugly writing: it offers no resistance to the page, no distinction between thick and thin &#40;which even a pencil will often give&#41; and it encourages writing with no real rhythm. Whereas a fountain pen gives writing an axis, ballpoint pens encourage endless looping. And no &#40;or little&#41; pride, because whereas one can sometimes look at a page written with a fountain pen and think &#34;that looks beautiful&#34;, one can never look at a page of ballpoint and think anything better than &#34;that looks tidy&#34;.</div>

It is called copperplate because the same style of lettering was used in engraving. The best known exemplar of the style &#40;actually a collection of styles&#41; is George Bickham&#39;s <i>Universal Penman</i>; there is also an excellent section on <i>l&#39;ecriture</i> in Diderot&#39;s encyclopedia. The style relies heavily on the characteristics of the writing instrument for which it was developed: the flexible steel nib that applies more or less ink depending how hard the writer presses. The &#39;cursive&#39; lettering shown above by Kyle is derived directly from these 18th century styles, and is properly called a roundhand for obvious reasons. As John Butler points out, writing this style with a pencil or ballpoint is silly because neither tool can give you the variance of what Cresci called &#39;the swelling line&#39; that gives the style its beauty. <BR> <BR>Ductus refers to the effect of the combination of nib thickness and writing angle. An italic ductus implies a broad nib pen &#40;as opposed to the pointed, split nib used for copperplate/roundhand&#41; usually held at an angle around 40 degrees off the horizontal. This gives a pattern of thick and thin strokes that we are familiar with from the italic types of the renaissance; by contrast, the romantic italic types of Bodoni and Didot are based on the swelling line of the split nib. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">When I grew up in Hong Kong they first taught us &#39;printing&#39; &#40;or &#39;block letters&#39;&#41;, then all of a sudden they said we had to learn &#39;cursive&#39;, which was really copperplate. It wasn&#39;t the Palmer Method &#40;as they were taught in North America&#41;, but a pure copperplate script. I was 8 or 9 at that time, and absolutely hated it. I thought it was really ugly. So I decided to go back to the block letters. My English teacher obviously didn&#39;t like that and said I had to write in cursive. After I went to study in England, I taught myself Italic hand &#40;Fairbank&#39;s method, more or less&#41; because I thought I had to improve my handwriting which, up to that point, was just a disjointed copperplate. I knew that&#39;s what they used to teach in England. The way they do it now is probably more like the Sassoon Method. Again, they first teach &#39;printing&#39;, then teach them how to join the letters. Sasson Primary, the type face designed by Rosemary Sasson, is still the de facto font to use in primary schools in England. <BR> <BR>Copperplate, when done well by a skilled calligrapher with a broad-nib pen could be extremely beautiful. But as an everyday script for handwriting, it is not very practical nor legible. Fairbank&#39;s italic hand is the best, in my opinion: clean, legible and beautiful. Still a very good modern hand. I think it&#39;s a shame we don&#39;t handwrite a lot of things now. We&#39;re losing the human side of written communication. I still enjoy handwriting a lot. Typography should not be the be all, end all of visible language.</div>
