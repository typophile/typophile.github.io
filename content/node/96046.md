    be? Surely, there will be no need for books nor contracts nor billboards nor,
    indeed, will there be any use whatsoever for the written word.\r\n\r\nMother Nature
    has done quite well for billions of years without fonts; why would Father Sky
    be any different? You really ought to take your namesake a bit more seriously,

    body: Actually I was approaching it from the angle of things that are "pleasurable"
      being given in great abundance in heaven as a basic concept of part of heaven
      itself is......Fonts give pleasure on earth before death, so even though they
      would not be "needed" in heaven, the mere fact of their potentiality for "pleasure"
      would dictate their being offered in heaven in some fashion to give pleasure,
      even though their "necessity" is not there, their "potential" for pleasure "dictates"
      that they be there.....If they were not there, then a potential for pleasure
      would be absent in Heaven.

    same as what is pleasurable on earth, since what is pleasurable in heaven -- at
    least in the traditional Christian conception -- will only be those things that
    are pleasurable to a sanctified being existing in a spiritual state, while that
    which is pleasurable on earth includes things that are pleasurable to a fallen
    being existing in a material state. So the real question here is whether fonts
    constitute a virtuous pleasure or a sinful one."

  body: "Sorry, zeno: you fail again.\r\n\r\nBeer has been around a lot longer than
    fonts. Beer also represents Nature's most perfect food source: bread and water.
    I recently went on a six-day fast, when all I consumed was Beck's Non-alcoholic
    beer, period. I found the experience to be beneficial, both physically, mentally,
    spiritually and emotionally\u2026and, sad to say, entirely font-free.\r\n\r\nAs
    a result of my recent incarceration (eight days on bread and water alone), I am
    a few pounds below my optimum weight of 138 pounds, and I get a little loopy if
    I miss a meal. Still, my mind is sharp, and my new-way-to-distribute-fonts plan
    is still on track, despite overwhelming reluctance from almost EVERYONE in this
    forum to take on the Elephant in the Room, evidently for fear of financial ruin,
    or some other cockamamie, cowardly excuse.\r\n\r\nNo guts, no glory. I got a few
    placeholder pages to put together, outlining the grand plan. Hypothetically speaking,
    Monotype can kiss my ass, or put up some serious cash to shut me up and shut me
    down. The world of font distribution WILL change; early adopters will reap the
    biggest rewards. Hrant: this means you."
