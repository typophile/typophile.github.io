body: "How much do you use geometry for your designs? Do you start of with some simple
  geometry, and then stray from it as each character needs? Do you apply a strict
  yet complicated system wich can be adopted by each letter form in you font? Do you
  eschew geometric systems alltogether?\r\n\r\nI'm just curious about how people work.
  Personally, I try to start with a system, then I make it more organic until it looks
  good. After this, ideally, I try to work the organic elements back into a geometric
  based system."
