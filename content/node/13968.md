body: I am using TypeTool to make some adjustments to SimSun.  The reason is that
  one of my clients wants me to compress a font slightly.  This feature is not available
  in the software I use for reporting, so I need to be able to compress the font at
  TTF level.  I have opened Simsun and used Tools|Transform and then changed the Horizontal
  scale.  This is all good except for the fact that one of the characters comes out
  really strangely.  Can anyone advise on this or alternatively, I would be happy
  to pay for some help on this.
