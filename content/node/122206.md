    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-eef/ is indeed fairly close.\r\nIdentifont

  body: Closest I have is 205 [[http://myfonts.us/td-IaCmDa|Bloo]] One by Damien Gautier
    mixing uppercases with lowercases ('LOnDOn PiLGRImaGe KaeneL SaLTImbaNQUeS'),
    very close but still not perfect with main differences on /K, /R and /B. BTW,
    what's your sample origin? If it appears to be a PDF, you may find directly the
    answer by inspecting its properties.

  body: I've just emailed directly to the graphic designer of the book. He said that
    this is a typographic creation specially made for the book. Sorry waisting your
    time. Thanks anyway

    The other half is learning new things (like Ryuk\u2019s post about Bloo).\r\n\r\nGlad
    you found your answer...."

  body: "Let\u2019s get some terms straight. This isn\u2019t bespoke typography, it
    is a bespoke <em>typeface.</em> Typography is, according to Wikipedia, the art
    and technique of arranging type to make written language most appealing to learning
    and recognition. Gerrit Noordzij\u2019s definition clarifies it even further:
    \u201Cwriting with prefabricated characters\u201D."
