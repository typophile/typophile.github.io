    why are you guys using inDesign for one page projects?</i> <BR> <BR>For one it&#39;s
    not a one page project: front and back. Also, though  <BR>I&#39;ve always been
    an Illustrator fan for all my single-page work  <BR>I am <i>extremely</i> irritated
    at the incomprehensible fact that type  <BR>anchor points have ceased to exist

    program, a practice that continues quite happily today with InDesign, whether
    the document has one page or 50.'

  body: It would be interesting if people started choosing InDesign over Illustrator
    for single page work, certainly. <BR> <BR>I use Freehand, because it always annoyed
    me how you could only ever have a single page in Illustrator &#40;which seemed
    to me to be an arbitary restriction&#41;, and I couldn&#39;t afford Illustrator
    AND a 700 quid DTP app AND FontLab. Something had to give. Feature bloat, which
    lets illustration packages act more like DTPers, and DTPers acting more like illustration
    packages, blurs the boundries? <BR> <BR>Mind you, I worked out a cunning way of
    getting InDesign CS for under 300 quid here in the UK, so maybe its time to get
    all jiggy with opentype... <BR> <BR>

  body: I use illustrator all of the time for 2-sided simple things. Before Indy &#40;why
    I now use&#41;, Illustrator became my goto app. I realized that while I had preached
    to my students that they should reserve illustrator for illustrative things and
    then put it all together in Quark .... well I realized a few years ago that I
    hated doing type in Quark. I mean it is possible but I found that type is much
    easier to do in Illy. When Indy came along I started using it when the items I
    designed required more than 2 paragraphs of type. But, I still find myself using
    Illy for Book Jackets and single page ads.
