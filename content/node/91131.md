  graphic designer and front-end developer working on a project where I want to use
  P22 Underground. Unfortunately the hinting on Typekits version is pretty shitty
  on Mac and even worse on Windows. You can do some browser sampling here: https://typekit.com/fonts/p22-underground\r\n\r\nTherefore
  I wanted to know if anyone have had experience with P22 underground from myfonts?
  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/underground-pro/\r\n\r\nOr if anyone have some
  ideas for great alternatives? I've been looking at ITC Johnston from fonts.com as
  one.\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance,\r\nNilas"

    think the term you are looking for is \u201Crendering\u201D. The Mac doesn\u2019t
    use the hinting included in the font files \u2014 it comes up with it\u2019s own
    interpretation of the curves as pixels. From what I can tell it looks like it
    struggles with the complex g and the light weights. These kind of issue will be
    there in all fonts. \r\n\r\n<em>\u2026 and even worse on Windows.</em>\r\nLook
    at the difference between IE8 and Firefox in Win 7. Something is definitely wrong
    here. I suspect the browser samples are to blame.\r\n\r\nAre you planning on using
    this for text sizes?"

    From the Firefox samples, it appears the font is autohinted, which means the horizontal
    stems like on the top and bottom of the \"z\" would be grid fit. But in IE8, it
    shows those stems as disappearing at 18, which shouldn't happen, even under cleartype,
    if there are Y direction instructions. \r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "Ah okay thanks, I'm not an expert on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe issues you're
    talking about I definitely see with some fonts, like this one. But I've used fontdeck
    and typekit before and have had great results. Specially with Apercu. So is not
    possible that the myfonts or fonts.com version is better rendered?"

    Most of these services offer trials.

    not on Mac, as all the Mac cares about are the outlines, and these are the same
    between the different vendors. They may render differently on Windows, however.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'I don''t know if this is the issue for you, but Underground, both the original
    and the P22 digital version, has relatively thick joins on the lower case. If
    that is what is bothering you, you might want to look at Gill Sans, which is a
    related design, but with the joins thinned more. '

    do to see if this can be improved. "
