  I am building and was going to just designate the type to be serif (Georgia, Times
  etc). The I thought about using their typeface instead.\r\n\r\nThe face is Casablanca
  Antique and it is a Corel font from 1992. I have no idea where I got it from but
  it appears to be distributed widely for free (I know I did not buy it).\r\n\r\nI
  have not done web in a long time and am not sure of the pros/cons of using @font-face.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone please advise?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJay"

    in a more creative way. See this article:\r\n\r\nhttp://unitinteractive.com/blog/2008/06/26/better-css-font-stacks/\r\n\r\nThis
    may not help you with this specific issue, since Casablanca Antique will not be
    on many systems, but it may allow you to cycle through a greater array of viable
    options."

  body: Cheers Aa, I actually read that article by chance a few days ago - think it
    was on 24ways.org. It is good but it's real hard to find a common face for both
    mac and pc.
