  anyone help me out with this type family? It's been bugging me and I've been unable
  to divine its identity. It's a latin with a peculiar, sharply calligraphic feel.
  Thanks in advance. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/donne_4468.jpg]"

  body: Thanks a ton, Mike! I never would have thought this was one of Carter's, but
    I dug out "The Art of Matthew Carter" and there it is -- albeit one that he considers
    almost too much Berthold Wolpe's work to be his own.
