  body: "The larger the type, the less space between letters is needed. If this image
    at 100 percent is the size the image is going to be, the kerning (tracking) is
    a bit loose. The smaller the type, the more tracking necessary. This only applies
    to all caps. Lowercase should never have additional tracking.\r\n\r\nI think the
    the leading could be tighter too. The space between the *+* and *DISTRICT* should
    be tightened if you tighten the tracking. Erik Spiekerman mentions in his book
    *Stop Stealing Sheep & Find Out How Type Works*, that the space between words
    should never be greater than the amount of leading. The reader's eyes will drop
    down to the next line between the words. The space between the *+* and *DISTRICT*
    is not more than the leading but I just mentioned that in case you have not heard
    it before.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps. Take care."

    I see more whitw than others, special attention letters like T, Y, L... they generate
    more white space.\r\n\r\nJ"

  body: "Thank you both for replying.\r\n\r\nThe type will have to work in large format
    (sign sized) as well as small size (business card, etc.). \r\n\r\nDo you think
    that a specific version for each size would be the best? As in a tighter version
    for the sign and a looser version for the letterhead?\r\n\r\n\r\nByron"

  body: "If there were a vertical line from the edge of the L the A and C of Arts
    Council should move to the left slightly. Close up after both of the C's in council.
    Tighten the DY in Ladysmith. Look at all the T's and visually balance the spaces
    on either side of the cross-bar. it's easy to see this on the T between I & H
    of Ladysmith. I would look at making the + the same as the cap height and aligning
    it so the vertical also lines up with the cap L of Ladysmith ( this would help
    balance the white space that occurs on the top right. You would have to reduce
    the stroke width to match the other characters. I would also tighten the leading
    further, possibly by as much as the crossbar of the T. I must admit the R annoys
    me as does the weight of the Y\u2026 apart from that\u2026 :D"
