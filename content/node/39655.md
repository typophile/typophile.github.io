    a more descriptive title for your IDs.

  body: Wow ... PattyFab rules with an iron fist around here. She launched a tsk-tsk
    missile at me after my first post and I'm not at all sure what she refers to here.
    And for which I am hoping to receive an explanation. Since I know she can, perhaps
    Ms. P-Fab could provide for me a more sufficient "title" for satya's "IDs." Ms.
    Fab, are you generally a grumpy person or do you just come here to direct traffic?
    Certainly someone as clearly intelligent as you has a humorous side, correct?
    What's the last funny joke you've heard?

    for this thread was just \"Type ID\". \r\nAs Patty said, the title itself should
    have a little description about the thread so that interested Typophiles can guess
    whether they are able to answer or not without opening the thread. ( Most of the
    time it works ). Also, it save lots of time and make it easy to find the threads

  body: Ahhhh ... and important piece of the puzzle thrown into the equation. Well
    ... yeah, then, satya, whatever Patty said. You must have used your mulligan already,
    I'm guessing. As for the typeface, I agree it almost certainly is not a complete
    alphabet given the interaction of the letters;  as for something similar, I'll
    certainly keep an eye out although others here are more likely to identify something
    immediately on sight.

  body: "Often when one makes strong, definitive statements or observations - like
    politicians, for example - there always are people comparing their words to previous
    things that person said. For what reason I do not know ... maybe to tear them
    down, prove them to be some kind of fraud, or whatever.\r\n\r\nIn this case, however,
    it seems Mr. Cordoba has attempted to do that with words that only further solidify
    my original statements.\r\n\r\nIn the above quoted text, Mr. Cordoba seems to
    take issue with my saying PFab \"...(c)ertainly she doesn\u2019t have to praise
    everyone - or anyone, really...\"\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, there is a difference
    between being told how what to say and how to say it, and the comment quoted above.
    For example, I would never suggest PFab EVER be stripped of her right to scold
    every single person here, if that's her thing. I don't particularly find it useful,
    but she absolutely has the right to do it. \r\n\r\nIf I were interested in controlling
    PFab's words and actions, I'd either have asked/told her to stop ridiculing/scolding
    people around here completely, or told her what and how to go about her scolding.
    However, I did none of those things. In fact I was merely attempting to elicit
    from PFab a side I am sure she must have, because I'm betting she has quite a
    few entertaining, funny and certainly educational things to say.\r\n\r\nWhen writing
    what you quoted above, I was responding to PFab's post telling me I needed to
    be more concise when posting my thoughts. That's telling me how to write something
    from which I was seeking a specific result. As a comparison, I would have a hard
    time with anyone telling PFab to be less gender- or age-specific when berating
    people around here (not saying she attacks any particular age or gender, just
    an example).\r\n\r\nAs for the SPECIFIC words quoted, I actually was attempting
    to entice PFab away from the Dark Side and to the side of The Force by informing
    her that doing so didn't come with the expectation that she should glad-hand everyone
    and spread artificial joy.\r\n\r\nI hate getting into philosophical things like
    this but I do take such issues quite serious and make a concerted effort on a
    day-to-day basis to not tread on anyone else's freedoms. If PFab wishes to do
    nothing but scold people on this board for the rest of her cyberlife, more power
    to her. I just feel like there must be a goldmine of really neat, fun stuff buried
    somewhere in her brain and I for one would love to see it. After all, I've looked
    through her work and she sure seems to have quite a bit going for her intellectually.\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone - such as Mr. Cordoba - read into my words anything different, I apologize.
    However, keep trying to find those contradictions ... although I should warn you
    they are few and far between, if they exist at all.\r\n\r\n"
