  body: Last time someone helped me they initially said they had the same problem,
    but then they reposted to the board and said they just had to download the files
    or something. I saved the files in photoshop as jpgs. If you recommend something
    different let me know. Thanks for your help. <BR>

  body: Okay, I see what the problem is. When you click on the jpg file it doesn&#39;t
    load properly for some reason. However, when I use the &#34;download the link
    to desktop&#34; option and then click on it from my desktop it opens fine. Please
    let me know if this works for you. <BR>Thanks again for your patience.

  body: Angela -- <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know why the board wasn&#39;t accepting your
    images in-line to begin with. I suspect it may have to do with the spaces you
    included in the file names. This may have prevented the upload mechanism from
    recognizing them as standard jpegs. I removed the spaces and re-uploaded the attachments.  <BR>
    <BR>Perhaps Jared or Joe can confirm whether this was the problem. <BR> <BR>I
    can&#39;t help you with idetnifying these typefaces. Not my area of expertise.

  body: 'Also noticed that her samples were 150dpi rather than 72. Be sure to use
    the &#34;Save for Web&#34; function of Photoshop rather than manually saving it
    as JPG. <BR> <BR>The spaces, however, could well have been it. '

  body: I will remember to remove spaces and save at 72dpi in the future. Thanks for
    the advice. <BR>I will await further help on identifying these two fonts. <BR>

  body: I haven&#39;t found a digital version of the neon font, but it looks like
    it could be a standard embroidery font. <a href="http://www.embroiderysa.co.za/hooked/storeitem107.html">Take
