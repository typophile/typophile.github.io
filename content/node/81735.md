    difference is that Corbel is not set as the standard font in MS Word as opposed
    to Calibri \u2013\_but does that make it popular? \r\nOr is the threshold for
    using Calibri just a tiny bit lower?\r\n\r\nAlso, it all depends on what you mean
    with \u2018popular\u2019."

    used. Ever. Kind of sad that people will keep beating the hell out of the old
    system fonts but never do anything with this good new(er) stuff.

    Calibri, not Corbel.\r\n\r\nOf the C* fonts (as they are referred to internally
    at Microsoft), Calibri is by far the most widely used because it is the default
    text font in MS Word. Corbel, by contrast, appears only in one of Word's predefined
    style sheets (the \u2018Module\u2019 style), which is one more than the sadly
    underused Candara. On the plus side, any use of Corbel that you do see represents
    conscious selection of that font, which is not the case with Calibri.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the WTF forum link, Florian. I had not thought to check that. It is sort of
    disturbing to see how frequently people are horizontally compressing Constantia."

  body: "I studied Microsoft's book \"Now Read This\" extensively, but have a hard
    time remembering what the faces look like or what the names are, let alone pairing
    them up correctly; except Constantia with its pointy serifs. \r\n\r\n\"Good\"
    faces now doubt, but lacking in personality (pardon me for applying a human quality
    to a typeface).\r\n\r\nWhatever the individual merits of the typefaces, the C
    typeface project was fundamentally flawed at the level of product development.
    \r\n\r\nIf one considers the collection as a megafamily, which is what the \"C\"
    naming, simultaneous publishing, and genre diversity suggest, Calibri, Candara
    and Corbel (the sans components) are neither sufficiently differentiated, nor
    sufficiently familyish. \r\n\r\nAs a megafamily, it's clear where Cambria (chunky
    serif), Consolas (monospace), Constantia (classic serif) and Corbel (sans/Frutiger
    clone) stand, but Calibri is vague\u2014neither really condensed nor really rounded,
    and Candara is tentatively flared.\r\n\r\nWhat's missing is a geometric sibling
    (the \"Gotham\"), and that suggests what went wrong, because as I understand it,
    ClearType does not favor diagonals and circular curves. It would appear that the
    focus on ClearType rendering created the lacuna in product development.\r\n\r\n"

    But I was specifically focusing on Calibri and Candara as not being sufficiently
    differentiated from Corbel.\r\n\r\n<em>You introduced the term \"megafamily\",

    that most of the faces fit clear genre niches. Surely if a company releases a
    group of types, in such niches, at the same time, with a similar technical gizmo,
    with a unifying naming scheme (\"C\u2026\"), and, as Hrant notes, unified x-height,
    then they are de facto a megafamily or suite?\r\n\r\nFor Windows users, speaking
    of workhorses, why not provide them with a geometric style, a condensed style,
    and some Light weights? That would be way more use than three marginally different
    sans faces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nick, I'm no MS apologist, but:\r\n\r\nI think C* is a very good job for
    such a mass-oriented corporation; just the fact they produced that nice booklet
    speaks volumes (pardon the pun). Look at what Apple -once revered for its typographic
    sensitivity- has been doing lately... Chalkboard?! I mean really, cloning Comic
    Sans. How low can you go? Anyway.\r\n\r\nCould C* have been better? Well, for
    a malcontent like me that answer is always Yes! Specifically, there could indeed
    have been more harmony* between the fonts. But \"megafamily\"? Absolutely not.
    Think about how people are supposed to use them. Are half a dozen fonts supposed
    to cover all the bases anyway? Well, we type designers hope that answer is No!
    And when it comes to pairing, I think it's fair to state that the better such
    fonts pair the less versatile they will be individually (which is how most people
    do -and probably should- usually use them). So C* doesn't really <em>replace</em>
    anything, which is great.\r\n\r\n* Note that the x-heights are normalized.\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of personality, I don't see how you could say that Constantia, Candara and
    even Calibri are lacking. And remember, these are supposed to be <em>system</em>
    fonts after all. Corbel for one thing is supposed to be neutral. Frankly only
    Cambria isn't my cup of tea in terms of styling - it seems... undecided of what
    it needs to be.\r\n\r\n> What's missing is a geometric sibling (the \"Gotham\"),

    regularity. Read for example how Jeremy Tankard had to give up on a more irregular
    \"w\" because of CT.\r\n\r\nBut yes, technical limitations did cause some design
    compromises. For one thing, the Bolds are too dark (just like in the old Core
    Fonts). But the question here is: did the compromise make sense? Is the solution
    balanced in terms of screen versus print, taking into account contemporary usage,
    and the sensitivity of users in terms of print versus screen? I think the balance
    is pretty good.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    there are a lot of birds out there already.\r\n\r\nI really like all of the ClearType
    fonts, I use Calibri a lot, then Consolas a little, then the others rather less

    this thread was about, once upon a time).\r\n\r\nI agree that the bolds are largely
    overbold but better than not being bold enough and I'm pretty sure there would
    have been a rationale for thicker bolds. In the name of doing something graceful/tasteful,
    I'm sure some bolds err on the light side. Bold should after all be what it is
    (i.e. bold). However of all the CT fonts, Corbel is by no means the worst offender
    for overly-bold bolds.\r\n"
