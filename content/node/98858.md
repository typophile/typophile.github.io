    by Bright Ideas. Could be derived from samples of Richard Nebiolos Aphrodite,
    which Nick Curtis made into the digital equivalent <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/mighty-ditey-nf/">Mighty

    body: Many thanks Renko, it is indeed Riesling, which also happens to be a free
      download font from Bright Idea. I also checked out Mighty Dightey which has
      very similar but not quite the same characters.
