  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi Everyone,

It's my first time posting and I don't have too much experience creating logos. I need some help in improving this logo. I am stuck at the moment. So any criticism would be greatly appreciated.

The company name is called Bolling Steel. The client name is Bolling and they own a steel company, so that's the background to the logo.

Thank you!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You're not off to a bad start. Here are some of my thoughts though with what you've shown here:
-Steer away from outlined type. It feels too weak for the strength you want to communicate.
-Make sure all your elements are perfectly aligned. Use guides, grids, rules, etc. Be as precise as you can, because with today's software, it's easy to be.
-You've already done this, but don't worry about color until you come up with a solid mark.
-Stay away from 3-D effects like embossing and drop-shadow.
-Do research.
Google "steel" and flip through the photographs
Go to www.istockphoto.com and do the same thing (stay away from the vector art there though, it may be too cartoony for what you're after)
Go to Wikipedia and read up

Hope some of this helps. Good luck.

		<div class="commentbody">first row, first column. i thought that one had a certain elegance in the shape to the "crest," and i could picture that as a placard welded onto steel. or riveted--i would like to see what 4 small white circles, on in each corner, would look like. 

i think steel--rivets. but don't overdo it.

also, with steel, who knows, maybe there's no reason to go color. i don't mind the use of white, grey, and black. however, regardless of color, the value of the two forms, the I and the B bother me. because the I beam is white it stands out most clearly, and i read this as IB--the letter I, the letter B. so try switching their colors.

that might not work tho--seems tricky to make a letter have an I beam without saying I.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think if you take the rivets out of the middle option and paint the mark in one color, you will have an <em>excellent</em> mark. Rebar is going to be easy to see and it won't be as decorated and fancy compared to how it is now. Then pair it with a larger bolder type (perhaps set it in two lines) and that's it, you got a winner.

PS. Oh, and if you feel like keeping rivets, consider moving them into the whitespace between I's vertical strokes.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree that it needs to be one color because splitting it up compromises legibility. I can see a roman numeral two and a 3, or Il3. Stick to one color, or keep each letter completely one color. 

I think the rivets could work well, but they're not quite right yet. Maybe use them on the outer corners to rivet the whole logo to the background? Play around.

I'd also try Bolling Steel on two lines because right now, it's too small compared to the mark, and it risks being read as "Boiling Steel" which is, well, just weird. Setting it in all caps might be the problem? Small caps may help, or perhaps all lowercase? It's one of those words that needs precise kerning, too, so once you settle on a layout and/or font, kerning could make you crazy. 

Once you're crazy, you'll officially be an experienced designer. :)</div>

I have revised my logo, and created some extra ones that are different from the "B". I'm not sure how successful they are. I feel like they are lacking and not really all that sophisticated. 

For the "B" Logo I made the letters all one color so it doesn't read I, B. I also moved the rivets to the 4 corners. Let me know what you all think. Thanks again in advance :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bollingsteel_09aug10_a_3489.jpg]</div>

I'm not feeling the choice of typeface though. It still feels far too weak for a steel company.
I'd try something like <a href="http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008">Gotham</a>.
It's not that different from what you have, but it's geometry makes it feel much stronger.</div>

I agree about the typeface. Something that looks a little more geometric would work better I think. Try Proxima Nova, Neutraface, Gotham, or Avenir.
