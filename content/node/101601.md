  rel=\"nofollow\">Her\xE1ldica Script</a></strong>\r\n\r\nWe are proud to add a very
  complex and new font to our collection.\r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophileheraldica_4167.png]\r\n\r\nOrnamented
  scripts are a Koziupa/Paul specialty, and Heraldica is one of their most expressive.
  It attains the very definition of deluxe by conjoining the classic thin-and-thick
  script treatment with thin-only counterpart strokes, then it goes the extra mile
  with a varied complement of overlaid flourishes. The usual assortment of multiple
  alternates and ending forms pushes it even further in class and versatility.\r\n
  \r\nMonograms, logos, jewelry packaging and book covers are only a few of the possibilities
  with such a high-end script.\r\n\r\nVisit our gallery called \"The Art Room\"  at
