body: "G'day guys,\r\n\r\nJust wondered if anyone could recommend a good OCR software
  package for mac OSX. It seems that there a few that only work with PC. We need to
  scan some back issues of our journal for an anthology, but as the layouts vary greatly
  the OCR would need to be reasonably smart. I've experimented with the one that comes
  with the penultimate Acrobat Professional 7 but it seems to require a lot of fine-tooth
  checking and changing which kind of defeats the purpose of saving time.\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n--N"

  body: No it made a lot of mistakes and inserted returns for double columned docs.
    Maybe it's a matter of playing with the options but hmm..

  body: Thanks Alessandro -- this is much more expensive than ReadIris, do you know
    if it's that much better?

  body: I used version 8. on MacOS Classic, it worked pretty well to me, I suppose
    this new release is even much better. I haven't tried ReadIris, Nicholas.
