body: SoTA&#39;s Interrobang 2 contains a great article, &#34;The case for a User-Friendly
  EULA,&#34; by Tiffany Wardle.  It just might have been inspired by a thread here
  on Typophile where she volunteered to put together a matrix of EULAisms from assorted
  foundries. GREAT JOB Tiffany!! <BR>Oh, and there is a bunch of other reallly good
  articles too :-&#41; <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    type&#41; can make change happen. BTW ... The chart would not have been possible
    without Nathan Matteson&#39;s constant help.

    in the room and panicked a little bit. Hehehe. My defense, when in a business
    situation and a little nervous, is to be more out-spoken.

  body: Agreed, Chris. Thanks to Tiffany and Nathan foundries are  <BR>reexamining
    their EULAs. A few even changed their docs when  <BR>they saw a preview of the
    chart and saw how unreasonable or <BR>unclear their EULAs were.

  body: The Savage beast is present in any and every human grouping, whether we deem
    them civilized or not. This goes for those who may inhabit the loftiest of White
    houses, regal palaces, terrorist cave hideouts, or grass huts. It does not matter
    how they smell, dress, or what language they speak. There have always been exploiters
    among us and, sadly it seems, there always will be. Judge individuals by there
    individual deeds, not easily identifiable groups by association. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: The Savage beast is present in any and every human grouping,... <BR> <BR>I
    might suggest that the beast is present in <i>every human.</i> It seems to me
    that even the clearest thinkers and kindest folk can be occasionally exploitive,
    just as those who appear self-involved or angry  can often surprise us with their
    sensitivity and generosity. <BR> <BR>Judge individuals by there individual deeds...  <BR>
    <BR>I think this might be the key; although it is often &#40;for me, at least&#41;
    difficult to accomplish. <BR> <BR>cheers, <BR>Dana

    and founderies. If you break a EULA, you can be sued in court, which happens occasionally.

  body: If a person is caught with their hand in the cookie jar the EULA also serves
    to protect the foundry ... whether that hand is one who has licensed the type
    but is in violation of the EULA or if the hand is someone that went to a blog
    of disrepute and downloaded it for free. <BR> <BR>Good point, Dana. And the cliche
    works for in this instance without being sappy.

    <BR> <BR>Indeed it is very difficult for us to accomplish but it is the only chance

    the American Indians, or the invading Europeans and settling Americans?&#34; <BR>
    <BR>The American Indians had their words, their laws and their &#34;writting&#34;.
    That&#39;s American Indians Civilization. <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s very easy
    to forget that we, europeans, were invaded a lot of times, and with every invasion
    a lot of important things were completly lost. <BR> <BR>Iberians, for instance,
    had their words, their laws and their writting. That was, or is, Iberian Civilization.
    You can see some of its productions in archaeological museums. <BR> <BR>Every
    cultural environment has its own laws and any individual inside this environment
    knows she or he gets in a bad situation if she or he forget that. <BR> <BR>By
