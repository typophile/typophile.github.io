  not in love with this face, but I'm trying very hard to make it work. I find myself
  struggling with finding a suitable font that pairs well with this .  Any suggestions?"

    often use script fonts (of course they don't have to!), it might be worth trying
    one of the scripts from Sudtipos? Adios Script Pro isn't too formal and is fairly
    delicate:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/adios-script-pro/ ?\r\n\r\nOr
    going a non-traditional route, the same designer made a geometric, Inlove\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/inlove/

    e.g. my Handsome Pro:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/handsome/\r\n\r\nFailing
    that, any light sans serif with a circular /o and even width would work, e.g.
    Proxima Nova Soft."
