body: Just to let you know that I will be away on holiday from  <BR>Saturday July
  19th on. I&#39;ll be back on Monday August 4th. <BR>As Stephen is ultrabusy, it&#39;s
  possible that tagging and  <BR>&#40;x&#41;ing of positive IDs will get a bit behind.
  <BR> <BR>Get over it. <BR>There are more important things in life. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  fun!
