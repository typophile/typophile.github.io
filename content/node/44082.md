  body: "That's incredible! Great find! Either it's a remarkable coincidence or the
    writer or her editor is a secret type lover. \r\n\r\nDoes make you wonder what
    the restaurant's sign is set in; it seems like too good an opportunity to pass
    up."

  body: Found their logo (at the bottom of <a href=http://www.loewshotels.com/Content/en/Hotels/Coronado-Bay-Resort/DiningLounge/Mistral_Menu_08.pdf>this
    PDF</a>). Sadly, there's no Mistral to be found; just Bodoni or some other modern.

  body: that makes me very sad. I often call restaurants by their font names with
    my friends. It's also fun giving people directions by signage fonts, which is
    what I thought this article was getting at for a quick second.
