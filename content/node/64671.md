body: "Limited edition wall calendar featuring twelve original illustrations by Post
  Typography. Each month presents a different interpretation of the number \"2010\"
  through a wide variety of inventive, meditative, and eye-popping lettering treatments
  and illustrations. More fun than those other boring type calendars out there, and
  even non type/lettering nerds can appreciate it.\r\n\r\nWe've got fewer than 100
  copies of this left... once they're gone that's it.\r\n\r\n<A HREF=http://www.posttypography.com/site/index.php?action=capital&id=795

  Yes, we know the illustrations are not technically \"typographic\", but it's just
  easier to describe that way. Cool?"
