    <BR> <BR>Libra is an uncial style, so it doesn&#39;t have caps.

  body: Libra was designed by S. H. De Roos in 1938, so it was a metal type first.
    I would guess Bitstream was earlier to digitize it, since they were one of the
    first to digitize fonts, but this is a guess. <BR> <BR>Jos

  body: ; &#41; <BR> <BR>Hmm. Mecanorma is more familiar to me because I used a lot
    of Mecanorma transfer lettering sheets. Libra was one my first PS font purchasing.
    The file was produced in 1991, but the font is in an earlier Bitstream catalogue.
    You win...
