body: "I created a font years ago (OTF) before the embedding restriction became an
  issue. How can i remove any embedding restrictions without re-creating the font
  in FontLab (too many VOLT hours involved). Just to change the flag!\r\nAn old MS
  tool (Font properties editor) won't help since it doesn't allow to completely remove
  the restriction to \"Installable\", only to increase the restriction. Any idea?"

    url http://www.typophile.com/node/102671\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Use ttx. First execute
    <code>ttx -t OS/2 fontname.ttf</code> (or otf); that  produces a small file named
    <code>fontname.ttx</code> containing only the <code>OS/2</code> table; you then
    replace with a text editor the value given at the line <code>&lt;fsType value=\"00000000
    00001000\"/&gt;</code> (the value you get is probably different) by the value
    you want; you then finally  execute the command <code>ttx -m fontname.ttf fontname.ttx</code>
    to get your new font.\r\n</li>\r\n<li> Buy DTL OTMaster to edit the OS/2 table;
    we are told the font is left otherwise untouched. If it is not, you tell us.\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>"

    \r\n<blockquote>\r\n<strong>Embedding</strong> - embedding permissions may be
    made more restrictive. \r\n</blockquote>\r\nAn update would not help you unless
    they changed their mind about that. \r\n\r\nBy the way SIL is also using line
    commands. They have a command <code>hackos2</code> in their impressive list  <a
    href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=fontutils\">FontUtils</a>
    of font utilities (that I have never tried)."
