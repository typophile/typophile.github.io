    typesetting, including specifics for French, as does Felici's Complete Manual
    of Typography.

  body: "Are you doing French for France, Canada or somewhere else? I ask as there
    are differences in the typographic conventions. \r\n\r\nFor instance, both FRF
    (for France) and FRC (for Canada) use a thin space between a quote mark and the
    text being quoted. FRF also uses a thin space before an exclamation mark, but
    FRC generally doesn't.\r\n\r\nSo, for instance,\r\n\r\nENG: He said: \"No!\"\r\nFRF:
    Il a dit : \xAB Non ! \xBB\r\nFRC: Il a dit : \xAB Non! \xBB\r\n\r\n(note: thin
    spaces are the prefered option for these \"extra\" spaces around punctuation and
    very easy to do in InDesign, etc. If you can't do a thin space, use a non-breaking
    space.)\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to put a resource on my work [[http://www.worldaccent.com/french/typesetting/|French
    typesetting]] page soon. But if you are typesetting Canadian French, there is
    an excellent comprehensive PDF (in English) available to [[http://cprp.ca/pdf/langue/Guide_1_0_eng.pdf|download
    here]].\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know which area of the world you're targeting and I'll
    try to offer some more advice.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Felici's book (mentioned above)
    is a great read, I think."

    from the Quebec ministry of health and social services, one in English, the other

  body: "Interesting links, Michel. Always revealing to compare and contrast a French
    and English version of the same document.\r\n\r\nI have always used no space before
    exclamation mark in FRC, and I still believe this is correct \u2013 in contrast
    to FRF where a thin space is always used. It's interesting that your link to Qu\xE9bec's
    La Banque de d\xE9pannage linguistique says that either is acceptable: \"Pas d'espacement
    ou une espace fine\" (No space <em>or</em> thin space).\r\n\r\nSo perhaps it's
    less of a firm rule, more a matter of taste?\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to
    hear any further opinions on which is preferable, especially from French Canadian
    typesetters or designers..."

  body: "I would also like to know what the actual usage is. I personally use the
    thin space (I use the LaTeX <code>babel</code> package with the <code>french</code>
    option and it is automatically put where needed, and sometimes where not needed)
    and I feel it is lacking when I read documents without it, but it is definitely
    a matter of taste.\r\n\r\nThe way the Office puts it: \"Si l\u2019on dispose de
    l'espace fine, il est toutefois conseill\xE9 de l'utiliser devant le point-virgule,
    le point d'exclamation et le point d'interrogation\" <em>i.e.</em> if you have
    access to a thin space, it is advised to use it in front of the semicolon, the
    exclamation mark and the interrogation mark. Now, who follows the advice? The
    2010 French General Income Tax and Benefit Guide from Canada Revenue does not
    use it. Nor does the guide from Revenu Qu\xE9bec. Many <a href=\"http://www.etudes.umontreal.ca/programme/caract_prog/index.html\">pdf
    documents describing programs on my own campus</a> (Universit\xE9 de Montr\xE9al)
    do not use it either. It would probably be ill advised to state that those that
    edited those documents were all mistaken. \r\n\r\nAs for the colon, a full space
    seems to be the standard; its use is advised by both the French imprimerie nationale
    and the Quebec Office de la langue fran\xE7aise. The LaTeX babel package however
    provides the option <code>\\frenchbsetup{ThinColonSpace=true}</code> that allows
    the user to opt for a thin space instead of a full space when the selected language
    is French (you can switch between languages as you like). Who asked for it, I
    don't know, but if it is there, someone must use it.\r\n"
