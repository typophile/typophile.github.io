  a reply with a list of things to tidy up the typeface.\r\none of the suggestions
  was:\r\n\r\nVector Check \u2014 About a dozen self-intersecting contours that should
  be\r\ncorrected. Correction time: 10 min.\r\n\r\nMy question is how do i identify
  this glyphs? what should i look for.\r\n\r\nTHANKS FELLAS."

    ask the foundry what tool they used to identify the issue or ask them for a more
