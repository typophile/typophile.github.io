  body: How do you add an inline like that? Usually just adding an inner stroke to
    type doesn't look too good.

  body: I'm not sure there's any automagic way to generate this effect. When I used
    this approach recently I broke out the bezier pen tool, added some guides so that
    the "baseline" of the inline characters would be consistent, and drew them individually.
