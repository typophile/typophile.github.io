  prof taught me that creating a italic and bild faces is simply a matter of skewing
  the shape or using a heavier outline on my vector shapes. But after doing some reading
  on my own, i've learned that this is completely WRONG!\r\n\r\nI understand that
  italics were used in printing to conserve on space, and should therefor be narrower.
  But what makes a good italic set? Why are the 'a's usually completely different
  within the same family, if choosing between italic and regular (roman?)?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nNate"

    believe a word of it! I wish it were so simple! It takes me twice as long to design
    the italic cut of a typeface than it does to do the upright roman. Even slanted
    roman fonts require considerable clean up to be reasonable. True italics are more
    than slanted, They are designed as a form to be comfortable enough a sibling to
    stand next to their roman brother but distinct enough to be clearly understood
    as something different. Traditionally, italics were based on calligraphic early
    scripts but that is not a requirement. The point is to be able to distinguish
    a title or quote within text while maintaining a similar weight.\r\nIf you have
    ever attempted to draw a bold weight for a regular weight, you would know that
    it is no simple task either. People have come to think of computer software as
    bone simple and infallible--not true for type design. There is one heck of a lot
    of work involved--think months, not minutes.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "My speculation is that the originators of italics valued the lowercase forms
    much more than capitals, perhaps because they are used with such greater frequency
    in body copy? Whatever the reason, the letters look different because they are
    intentionally fancier.\r\n\r\nAn italic alphabet is simply a different creature
    than a regular upright roman style, much like a blackletter face has letters that
    look different because they just do. Since  italics are nice to read, and can
    vary well in weight, they became so intermingled that they are often thought of
    as just variants of a regular face. Speculating again, I think this trend was
    accelerated by the word-processing programs of the 80's that encouraged bolding
    and italicizing in every typeface, even when that wasn't good looking.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes, your prof is very wrong. I wonder what he designs. The differences between
    \"regular\" and heavier or lighter faces is complex and subtle. Often, using a
    heavier outline is a starting point for making a new weight, but it is just something
    many people put in a guiding layer, to assist with the new design.\r\n\r\nSkewed
    fonts are generally called obliques, which some big-name type designers prefer
    for typeface families that exploit geometric or modern design principles. Obliques
    still commonly have some hand-tweaking done afterwards to make them feel better.
    Faux-italic is the way a computer generates an oblique face on-the-fly if you
    don't have one installed for a particular family.\r\n\r\nYou may find it interesting
    that here are also a few \"upright italics\". The have vertical stems, but share
    forms with the Italic alphabet."

    some free-lance design work in the 80s. Although they're not great design classes,
    our school wouldn't have any at all without him. So, I'm at least glad for what
    I've got; I wouldn't even be interested in typography without him.\r\n\r\nI have
    to write a paper related to design, so I guess the history of italics would be
    a great subject (my prof. and I will both learn something)."

  body: "I've begun my little paper and it is coming along nicely. Aldus Manutius
    was certainly the key here. \r\n\r\nHowever, it raises an interesting question:
    Bernhard von Mallinckrodt is credited as coining the term 'incunabula'. From what
    I've read, the cut-off date for the term is 1500, which was given arbitrarily.
    Is that true though? It seems odd that he wouldn't be aware of Manutius' 1501
    Virgil, which was not only the intoduction of italics into moveable type, but
    also the octavo format. It seems to me that this was an important move towards
    democritizing books, as the goal was to make them less expensive and more portable.
    Is there any documentation to support the theory that 1500 was not an arbitrary
    date, but rather chosen because of Manutius' advances?"
