    will help you understand what you want PHP to do for you, but other than that,
    I wouldn''t say you have to know anything in particular about anything prior to
    learning something new. '

  body: "@fredrikrob Answer is Yes, your knowledge in HTML is applicable to PHP. Think
    of it as HTML with server side programing. As matter in fact most php pages are
    just HTML pages with couple of lines of PHP codes.\r\n\r\n@Theunis de Jong sometime
    web designers hide in the corner a typographer's hangout hoping to learn a thing
    or two from typographers"
