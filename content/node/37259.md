  moment I'm researching \"Garamond isn't Garamond\". It would be super nice if you
  would like to add opinions on favorite cuts of Garamond and why this is your favorite.
  \r\n\r\nAny opinions or information on the subject is welcomed. \r\n\r\nWhich digitalized
  Garamond is the one that is closest to the original drawings, anyone know? \r\n\r\nAlso
  do you use Garamond and for what kind of occasions. If you don't use it, any specific
  reasons? \r\n\r\nAre there other typefaces based on the Garamond that you prefer
  using today? \r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanx,\r\nJenny"

    to see the Sabon Next properly (don't have it), from what I read it seems to be
    more true to the original Garamond cut and his wish for neutrality. More heavy
    and rounded and a more even tone to it. Any other differences? \r\n\r\n"

    the better freelance art directors for publishing houses. I still remember Tony
    Russo using Garamond and if not, then Cheltenham for all the blurbs... and sometimes
    a title of two. Mike Stromberg was always creating title type with Garamond mixed
    wtih Mistral.\r\n\r\nIt served its purpose - but Garamond was always known for
    a small x-height -- so it wasn't as easy to read as other serif fonts. However,
    ITC changed all that when they redrew it and called it ITC Garamond - one of the
    first things you notice is the higher x-height."

  body: "Beatrice Warde\u2019s piece is called \u2018The Garamond types: 16th and
    17th century sources considered\u2019, and it appeared for not very convincing
    reasons under a pseudonym, \u2018Paul Beaujon\u2019, in the big hard-back journal
    <em>Fleuron</em> (no. 5, 1925, pp. 131\u201379). Not easy to get hold of, but
    there is a complete reprint of <em>Fleuron</em> (7 volumes) and the piece is also
    included in a <em>Fleuron anthology</em> (1975) edited by Francis Meynell and
    Herbert Simon.\r\n\r\nThe main point to bear in mind (and to answer the implied
    question) is that everybody did not believe that the types for which there were
    three sizes of matrices (no punches) at the Imprimerie nationale in Paris were
    actually made by Claude Garamond. Arthur Christian, the director of the IN in
    Paris, did. (His revival, cast from the old matrices in 1900 and fitted out with
    extra sizes cut by professional punchcutters, used the alternative spelling of
    Garamond\u2019s name, Garamont.) So did ATF, who made a high-profile type called
    Garamond. And so, to begin with, did Stanley Morison in England, who got the printer
    he worked with to import the ATF type and persuaded British Monotype to make a
    \u2018Garamond\u2019 based on the IN type. (US Monotype got Goudy to draw one
    too, a lively type, underappreciated I think.)\r\n\r\nBut according to Warde,
    Henry Lewis Bullen, librarian and publicist at ATF, where she worked before coming
    to England, told her he was sceptical. The main critic was Jean Paillard (probably
    Bullen\u2019s source), who tried unsuccessfully to persuade Christian to be more
    cautious in his claims. He wrote a brilliant and scholarly essay, bringing together
    most of what was known about the life and work of Garamond, <em>Claude Garamont,
    graveur et fondeur de lettres</em>. It was published by the small typefoundry
    Olli\xE8re in Paris in 1914 with a specimen of their new Garamont type.\r\n\r\nShortly
    afterwards Paillard joined the army and was killed in Northern France within weeks.
    Not surprisingly, the specimen did not attract much notice. I know of no copy
    in Britain. The only one I have found in a US library catalogue is in the New
    York Public Library. After his death, Paillard\u2019s brother gave a copy of the
    specimen to the Biblioth\xE8que Nationale in Paris, adding a note critical of
    Christian. Quite recently the printing museum in Lyon has bought one, only the
    second known copy in France. Curiously, it was given to the Lyon printer Audin
    by Stanley Morison.\r\n\r\nSo Morison knew Paillard\u2019s essay, and so did Warde
    (she mentions it, and perhaps read Morison\u2019s copy). She did a lot of hard
    work, her essay has good illustrations and it is well worth reading. But it owes
    far more than she is willing to admit to Paillard, whose essay nobody knew, and
    it also follows some very misleading trails too.\r\n\r\nHer one stroke of genius
    \u2013 and luck \u2013 was to spot during her work in the British Museum (now
    British Library) that the so-called \u2018Garamond\u2019 types at the IN were
    in fact look-alikes, the work of Jean Jannon, a typefounder of Sedan. Having made
    the discovery, she says she rushed to get the overnight train to Paris where the
    only copy of Jannon\u2019s specimen of 1621 was in the Mazarin library. (She later
    published a facsimile.) But how did she know it was there? There is no published
    catalogue. Does her husband Frederic Warde, who had lived in France, and from
    whom she was becoming increasingly detached, somehow come into the story? It seems
    quite likely.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain. Morison had an unerring flair for publicity,
    and without being too cynical one can be sure that this was what helped the story
    to run, and run, and run.\r\n\r\nPaillard\u2019s French text was republished in
    1969 by the filmsetting firm Ofmi-Garamont under a title that is not his, <em>Qui
    \xEAtes-vous, Monsieur Garamont?</em> (\u2018Who are you Mr Garamond?\u2019) Good
    question.\r\n"

    versions of Garamond to produce typefaces--Fontesque and Oneleigh--which, although

    may nonetheless claim to be illegitimate (if not illegible) descendants.\r\n"

    I've found a very nice old specimen from a printer here in Amsterdam. Although
    it was called Garamont, instead of Garamond. After reading the above  posts I
    still find the Garamond and Garamont a bit confusing... do you know why for example
    the director of the IN spelled it with a t? The specimen I found here in Amsterdam
    was also spelled with a t. Where does the t come from?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "> Where does the t come from?\r\n\r\nWhen Garamond (or Garamont) did some
    publishing in 1545 he put his name on the title page of a book in French as Claude
    Garamont (Beatrice Warde showed an illustration of it), which is the best proof
    we have of his own preference. But most later writers spelt the surname \u2018Garamond\u2019,
    until scholars like Paillard went back to \u2018Garamont\u2019, and in France
    this is now the preferred form. But since ATF and Monotype used the spelling \u2018Garamond\u2019
    for their types, English-speaking people (I'm one of them) find it difficult to
    break the habit. Both spellings are right in their way.\r\n\r\nIt's irrelevant
    to the question, but the italic combination <em>r</em> and <em>a</em> in metal
    type is a problem: normally you can\u2019t kern the r because it would hit the
    next letter in combinations like <em>ri</em> and <em>rl</em>. Even on some of
    Garamond\u2019s own title pages the <em>ra</em> combination shows too much space
    between them, but for the little italic on his French title page with \u2018Garamont\u2019
    on it he shows an <em>ra</em> ligature \u2013 or maybe it's specially kerned.
    It looks better."

    trying for years, but not with too much determination, to find out more about
    Jean Jannon, partly because of his Calvinistic connections. I've often wondered
    if and how that played a role in what he did. The Calvinism of Calvin has, of

    features in types. But one might note that Jannon's tiny types, like his <em>Sedanoise</em>
    were celebrated, and that an earlier protestant punchcutter, Pierre Haultin, had
    made a little <em>nonpareil</em> that was widely used for printing small-format
    Bibles. Calvinists liked to buy Bibles, in their own language if possible, so
    perhaps protestant punchcutters tried hard to make types that would be suitable
    for printing them.\r\n\r\nHaving mentioned Garamont's spelling of his name in
    1545 and his handling of the <em>ra</em> combination, I ought to show them both
    (from Warde's article). The <em>ra</em> looks good in <em>Francoyse</em> too (but
    the <em>a</em> with macron causes trouble in the line above): \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Garamont
