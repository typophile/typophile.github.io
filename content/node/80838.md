body: "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nI recently finished this font (which I've named Shine)
  based on a typeface briefly seen in the 20th Century Fox/Blue Sky Studios animated
  movie 'Robots.'  I assumed the font was only made for the two phrases seen in the
  film and was not rendered as a complete character set.  Using a few screen shots
  from the movie I proceeded to draw them all by hand.  Yes, on paper!  Having to
  design about half the characters myself.  Then scanned them and used my rather primitive
  (but still much loved) HP Image Zone program to complete them.  \r\n\r\nNote: a
  better resolution image of the character map can be found here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/94121\r\n"

    are centered on the x-height, with ascenders and descenders, and are made to better
    flow in lowercase settings."

  body: It's nice, especially the y, looks like a hybrid form of y and the Dutch "ij"-glyph
    to me. And I think the overall font is playful enough to handle the dotted numbers.

    because the \"g\" and \"9\" would have looked the same.  I didn't want to have
    so many dots that it became overwhelming so put them within the letters only.\r\n\r\n"

    you've posted above makes a good logo for us.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure how to
    go about asking for usage permission... But message me back here if you have an
    issue with me using your font. (I guess) Very nice work, and thank you."
