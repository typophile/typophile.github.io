  body: "You have valid concerns and agree with most of them. But you should be communicating
    directly with your designer. The design has many issues that need addressing.
    By coming here tells me you're not satisfied with the logo. You already stated
    your primary issues. As a designer I'd want to hear them from you. \r\n\r\nAnd
    if it doesn't work out with your current designer. I'm sure many on here would
    love a crack at it. =)\r\n\r\nGood luck. "

  body: "> could this [logo] work with other, wholly \r\n> unrelated organizations?\r\n\r\nI
    agree that it's a fairly abstract symbol. But of course your current logo \u2014
    a tree \u2014\_isn't all that specific to your mission either; I'm sure there
    are thousands of unrelated companies that have trees in their logos, ranging from
    arborists to paper companies to doctors offices. :)\r\n\r\n> adaptability across
    print & screen media\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't reproduce well in a Xerox or fax, but
    that's probably not a big consideration. In print it should reproduce ok if you've
    using a good print shop. But these days screen media is the main consideration
    for many companies, as most companies are using conventional printing less and
    less.\r\n\r\n> Will this be able to endure?\r\n\r\nIt's certainly a contemporary
    look; perhaps even a tad trendy. But if you're hoping for a timeless logo, keep
    in mind that most logos eventually start looking dated, and most larger companies
    change (or at least tweak) their logos periodically.\r\n\r\nAs hola said, these
    are really things you should be discussing with your designer. A discussion forum
    like this might be a good way to get a quick opinion, but designing a logo requires
    a lot in in-depth thought and discussion and your designer has hopefully given
    these issues a lot of thought."
