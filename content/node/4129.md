  the Type 1 fonts installed, I came upon this old Image Club beauty, <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=405813"

  body: Nice job Mike! If I turn the g upside down I have the d. The only thing left
    would be smoothing the terminals on them. <BR> <BR>I have that collection too,
    so I should lose points for not recognizing it. <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: What a dufus I am for not even seeing that inverted-g-for-a-d. It&#39;s so
    obvious! <BR> <BR>Type 1 fonts on a PC, at least for me, get short shrift. I rarely
    trot them out and <BR>then I forget what&#39;s there. <BR><br>
