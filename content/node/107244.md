  body: "Thanks for the better pic.\r\nI had to download your original pic to make
    any sense of it. I edited it to look like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UnknownStencil107244_3502.jpg]\r\nI
    looked at various stencil fonts and none were a good match either for a base font
    or choice of where to make the stencil gaps.\r\nI suspect this is custom logo
    work.\r\nAnyway the base font is close to Helvetica Neue Black.\r\nI did some
    cuts and minor further editing of A and the result looks like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HelveticaNeueBlackStencil_5283.jpg]\r\nPretty
    close.\r\nYou could do the same to reproduce this part of the logo.\r\nDon"
