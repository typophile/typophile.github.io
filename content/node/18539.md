body: Has anyone else tried to install or upgrade to [[FontExplorer X|FEX]] 1.0? I
  just did and it errored out after relaunching while updating the database. I can't
  get it to run at all now. I'm trying to figure out if this is something others are
  experiencing or not. (I did submit a bug report.)

    Update\" command in the program menu) or did you download the file and run the
    installer?\r\n\r\nI updated via the program, so I can't give any direct advice
    about the normal installation process yet. If you delete the files and the program
    preferences in the library, and then reinstall, you might be clean. I'm at home
    right now (its 10:30 pm here), but I can try to get a better answer for you tomorrow
    at work."

  body: "Earlier this afternoon, I ran what I think was the most recent beta version
    (it's gone now, so I don't know exactly) and I got an announcement message saying
    that 1.0 was out and would I like to install it. Never had a problem with the
    live install before, so I clicked okay. After it downloaded and installed 1.0,
    it launched 1.0 and the rest is as I've described. \r\n\r\nIt is possible it's
    something specific to my system. I was having some strange disk behavior which
    I fixed (or at least I think I fixed) this morning. It's possible it is related
    to that. But the previous version (whatever it was) was running fine after the
    disk repairs as far as I can tell. In other words, I did the upgrade after after
    having done the disk repairs."

    is still in my library. So it''s no big deal to me if FEX deletes a font. I use
    that function when I no longer want to manage a font with FEX. It simply doesn''t
    have a copy in its own library anymore. '

  body: I was running FontExplorer during the Beta versions and gave it up because
    it took forever to render my fonts. Is this still a problem with the new X version
    for Mac. It really bothered me that when I just wanted to scroll through all my
    fonts one by one using the arrow keys, that sometimes with the larger families
    there would be a huge lag of time in between switching while it was rendering
    the face on screen. Maybe I will switch back if someone has some good news about
    that issue on this thread, otherwise its a no go for me.
