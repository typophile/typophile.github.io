body: "hello folks,\r\n\r\ni'm building a font with a lot of alternative glyphs. i
  wrote a custom encoding file, with a list of alternative glyphs, each with a name
  suffix, e.g. Ccedilla.gt or Eogonek.ro.\r\n\r\nhowever, when i select this encoding
  in the font window, in few cases, it shows the default glyphs in places where the
  alternatives should be. even when i actually create the alternative glyph, it still
  remains out of place. have anyone experienced this? does anyone know any solution?\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen
