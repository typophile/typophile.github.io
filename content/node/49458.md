  have just spent around 300 hours and 8 weeks working on my first type family. It's
  been absolutely pain staking work, but now it's complete I think it's worth it.
  Have and look and let me know if you like it, It's been accepted by T26, but again
  I am a beginner learning a new craft, so please go easy on me :D\r\n\r\nhttp://www.behance.net/Gallery/Hirukoa-Type-Family/125049\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAlex.\r\n\r\n"
