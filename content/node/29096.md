body: I'm going crazy trying to find the exact font of the Wired Magazine September
  2006 issue. I know this file is too small, but it's the only one I could find, and
  hoping someone knows the issue. Thanks. Kristofer

  body: I've got a copy of that issue of Wired. I didn't recognize the face, but it's
    more geometric than DIN -- sort of a cross between DIN, Gridnik, and Stratum.
