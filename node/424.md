  body: 'The first thing to note is that Sanskrit is not only written using the Devanagari
    script. Most of the scripts of India have been used, at one time or another, to
    write Sansrkit, even if this means only transcribing from Devanagari texts into
    a local script. The most extensive examples of Sanskrit written in a script other
    than Devanagari are Tibetan. So it is something of a misnomer to talk about &#39;Sanskrit
    types&#39;. <BR> <BR> <BR>I have a request for anyone interested in Indic scripts
    and typography: does anyone have any samples of types -- in Devanagari or any
    other script -- cut by Ranoji Raoji Aru &#40;1848-1922&#41;? I have only one example,
    a Devanagari type, shown in Naik&#39;s <i>Typography of Devanagari</i> &#40;Bombay,
    1965&#41;, and would love to see more. Also can anyone confirm the truth of the
    legend that Ranoji Raoji Aru was illiterate and could not read the languages for
    which he cut such beautiful type?'

  body: I have two pieces of Tibetan calligraphy &#40;seed characters&#41; tattooed
    on my upper arms, Vamh and Hum, which come from Siddham calligraphy &#40;a written
    form of Sanskrit&#41;. There&#39;s a great book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1570621225/qid=1056404594/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-6444761-8047104?v=glance&amp;s=books">Sacred
    Calligraphy of the East</a> with descriptions and pictures of several of this
    calligraphic alphabets, along with notes on the religious significance of the
    characters themselves &#40;each of my tattoos is the symbol of a buddha, being
    the Dainichi of the Diamond Realm and Ashuku - the Japanese name of the Immovable
    Buddha&#41;.

  body: sean- <BR> <BR>Tibetian calligraphy although belongs to central asia, and
    is sourced from the oldest form of types, sanskrit, in some form or the other
    belongs to devnagari derived from sanskrit. <BR> <BR>devnagari is the hindi, marathi
    font&#40;2 dialect most used as a communication in india&#41;other than these
    2 languages, we have 26 other launguages which are spoken and written differently
    and have peculiar style of typography, but again derived from sanskrit. <BR>the
    family tree is really vast:-&#41; <BR>i can show you some fonts, which may change
    your perception between japenese, tibetian and indian typography. <BR>

  body: I studied Sanskrit for a number of years. Although I was never fluent in the
    grammar and my comprehension was slow and arduous, I could smoothly read/chant
    verses from the Bhagavad Gita, Yoga Sutrani, and various slokas and mantras. Much
    of my ability, unfortunately, has atrophied through disuse. <BR> <BR>Somewhere
    I have sketches for a couple of Devanagari designs, one based on the handwriting
    of my teacher &#40;an American&#41;, and a Gujarati as well. But I never developed
    any of them into a font, as the prospect was quite daunting at the time. With
    the advent of OpenType and Unicode, this would probably be much more do-able than
    it was nine years ago. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>
