    ATypI version of the Vox system is. There really isn\u2019t any other organization
    trying to maintain a standard. Poke around some more and you\u2019ll quickly discover
    that just about everybody who writes a type textbook has something to add."

  body: Good answer, James. Classifying type is not a science like classifying animals
    or plants. It's far too subjective to be useful to everyone. I would examine a
    few methods and then organize in a way that make sense to you.

  body: "Rather than static classifications I prefer categorizing by aspects like
    Noordzij's translation (broad nib pen contrast) vs expansion (pointed pen contrast),
    serif vs sanserif, upright vs italic construction, maybe round vs broken curves,
    which together allow covering a wide range of typefaces: The Renaissance/Humanistic,
    Transitional, Classicistic distinction can be applied to serif and sanserif type
    alike, even to slab serif type (which offers a finer grid than the single \"Egyptian\"
    in your list). Turning to the broken category, maybe consider, with Noordzij,
    Textur as a broken upright and Fraktur as a broken italic, rather than just \"Blackletter\".
    This approach helps to look at typefaces more carefully and focus on their construction
    rather than secondary or even accidental aspects.\r\nLimitations of static classifications
    become obvious with \"Calligraphic\" or \"Stylized/Decorative\" which can contain
    very different typefaces for which there is no place in any other case.\r\nIf
    you can get hold of it, have a look into the first volume of the <em>Scangraphic
    Digital Type Collection</em>, edition 4/1990, pp. 65-81.\r\n"

    Types: An Introduction</em></a>, by [[Alexander Lawson]]. Chapter 3 is devoted
    to type classification and includes a discussion of the Vox system, the ATypI
    system, the British Standards system, and the DIN system, plus Lawson's own attempt
    to formulate a rational system.\r\n\r\nThere is also a very good article by Jonathan
    Hoefler, \"On Classifying Type\", in <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EMag.php?issue=42\">Emigre
    42</a>. Maybe you can find it at a library."
