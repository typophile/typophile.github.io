  body: Nice. Reminds me of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bitstream/oranda_ot/">Oranda</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/pmn_caecilia_std_ot_virtual/">Caecilia</a>.

  body: PS... at one time this was given away as Union but has since been pulled from

  body: Oh I feel silly. I've suggested Olsen to several people as an alternative
    to Oranda. Thanks, Mike.

  body: Actually, in an amazing coincidence, I had managed to donwnload the regular
    and bold weights when it was called Union (I think from FontShop). Made my day!
    Thanks again.
