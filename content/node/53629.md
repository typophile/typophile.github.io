  cover_4542.jpg]\r\nThis book is a collection of funny and embarrassing stories from
  teens so the cover emphasizes that. The layout is very different but it's interesting
  and appropriate for this particular book. The typewriter font reminds me of the
  biology tests I took in high school. Those tests seem to have been copied over and
  over again for the past 20 years so the type on the cover is really appropriate.

    looked! Very appropriate design.\r\n\r\nP.S. A search on Google reveals that the
    designer is <a href=\"http://covers.fwis.com/worst_years_of_your_life\">Catherine
    Casalino</a>."
