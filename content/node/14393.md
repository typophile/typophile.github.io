    body: It was used on a series of soup labels that were produced pre-digitally.
      The original files and designer are apparently unavailable, and the company
      wants to match it on new labels. How long ago it was originally produced is
      anybody's guess. If I can't find anything closer, I'll probably use Gill Sans
      Bold Cond. and modify it myself. Thanks!
