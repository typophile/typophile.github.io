body: I am doing a corporate identity program and have created a logo patterned off
  Neo Sans and Aura. I am using Neo Sans as the display type and was wondering what
  would be a good serif typeface for longer entries of text, such as in a brochure.
  I was thinking that a typeface with slightly squared shapes would be a good, yet
  any search for squared serif only finds slab serif typefaces. Any suggestions would
  be appreciated.

  body: Melior is indeed the prime example of a squarish serif. I think it could be
    a good match to Neo Sans.

  body: Thanks very much. That's what I was looking for in terms of a "squarish" serif.

  body: Ok, I checked out Melior. While it's a nice font, the italic doesn't look
    well-designed. It appears as if the regular font was given a slant as an afterthought
    in order to have an italic version of the face. Meta Serif is quite nice with
    a nicely designed italic. Doesn't have the same square amount as melior, but certainly
    more than your usual serif faces. I'm leaning toward that one right now, but still
    looking at other options.

    above does not show the italics. Try this: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/IbisText\r\n\r\nYou
    might take another look. Download the PDF to see sample text settings.\r\n\r\nThe
    inspirations behind Ibis included Melior. I think the italic is a particularly
    nice match-up."

  body: Thanks Kent. While I do like the square aspect of the font, I feel the serifs
    are too strong for easy reading in smaller point sizes. The one thing I don't
    like about Meta Serif is that the upward strokes on the M aren't straight, but
    instead slant outward. The ideal font would be Melior, but with a nice italic.

  body: "I think Ibis is perfect for reading. But if you want something a bit more
    humanist than Ibis and you want to avoid Melior, then perhaps Pagewalker, Cavole
    Slab or Loreto? Sommet Serif is also quite squarish but it has a very sharp texture
    which I think isn't what you need.\r\n\r\nOther than that I think for a squarish
    serif you will have to look at slab serifs. In my opinion Ibis is still your best
    choice though."
