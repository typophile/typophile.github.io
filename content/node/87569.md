body: My MacPro has been acting crashy, in the midst of a very busy spell of work,
  of course. Several trips with my 50 lb computer to the Apple Genius bar and a very
  clever tech guy have led to the conclusion that corrupt fonts have been the source
  of my crashes. I use FontExplorer 1.2.3. I have too many fonts, natch. Any great
  ideas as to how I can identify which fonts are corrupt? Should I upgrade to FontExplorer
  Pro? Any ideas as to how I can preserve my useful, used fonts so I can keep working,
  and isolate the remainder to be added gradually? Thanks in advance, and Happy Thanksgiving
  to all.

    it\u2019s buggy, poorly-documented, and often flags valid fonts as having problems.
    But it\u2019s a start. Sort good from bad family by family, and back them up so
    that you have clean copies if this happens again.\r\n\r\nUpgrading to a new version
    of Font Explorer does sound like a good idea."

  body: You can deactivate half the fonts, and see if the crashing stops, then deactivate
    the other half. When you know which half causes it (assuming there's not a ton
    of corrupt fonts), do the same with half of that half, and so on, till you narrow
    down the culprits.
