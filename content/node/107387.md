  I believe it's been modified, but I would like to know the base font. There are

  body: 'Thanks so much, fvilanakis! I looked at House Industries'' site, and the
    letters in my post seem to be a combination of Global/Bullet Small Caps, and Spaceage
    Black Beta, but it''s almost certainly a House Industries font. Very helpful!
    You''re awesome. '
