body: "Design pages with even color is something I\u2019ve somewhat unconsciencely
  picked up over time. It is to some extent rooted in metal type and it\u2019s optical
  sizes, but if I remember correcly I also belive Tschichold had a thing or two to
  say about the subject. \r\n\r\nI rarely have projects where completely even color
  is ideal, but the principle has stayed with me and is especially apparent in my
  choices of contrasting fonts in a hierarchy. In fact, this post is mostly about
  contrast, but contrast viewed in the light of \"even color\".\r\n\r\nI had a designer
  friend ask me to crit his work today. Looking at it I realized he\u2019d never learnt
  any of this stuff (what do they teach them anyway?), and tried explaining the idea:
  \"\u2026 contrast needs to be clearly marked, be it by weight, style, emphasis etc.
  Contrast is applied in a hierarchy, and the hierarchy needs to be consistent, pairing
  fonts should harmonize, but be clearly different \u2026\" And so on and so on. However,
  my oral skills can be likened to that of a sack of rotten potatoes and I\u2019m
  pretty sure he didn\u2019t understand even a wee bit of what I tried to say. \r\n\r\nGetting
  to the point: Are there any good discussion on the topic here at Typophile, or if
  not, would you possibly consider voicing your thoughts in this thread?\r\n\r\nBtw:
  I\u2019m talking about typography, not type design.\r\n"

  body: With all due respect to Typophiles, I think giving your friend a relevant
    chapter from Bringhurst or some similar book would be more instructive than reading
    an online thread full of disagreements and fragmented conversations. Especially
    for the basics. Or maybe Thinking With Type, by Ellen Lupton, which is a fun introduction.
    (I'm not sure how much your friend knows, but if he is trained as a designer,
    he has likely already read these and similar books. Although I don't actually
    know "what they teach them anyway," as I'm self-taught.)

  body: That's probably true, Jared. Thanks. You wouldn't believe the shallow design
    education offered here.

    just make type, I never use the stuff.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
