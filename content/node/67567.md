body: "I understand the usage of the tilde character for various glyphs. What I don't
  understand is why the asciitilde and the tilde are two different sizes. What is
  the point? Is there some usage for the asciitilde that is not already covered by
  the tilde? Sign painters sometimes use the asciitilde as a hyphen, but somehow I
  don't think that is it's intended usage. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com/|<em>from

  body: "<strong>Computing Dictionary</strong>\r\n\r\ntilde character\r\n\"~\" ASCII
    character 126.\r\n\r\nCommon names are: ITU-T: tilde; squiggle; twiddle; not.
    <strong>Rare</strong>: approx; wiggle; swung dash; enyay; INTERCAL: sqiggle (sic).\r\n\r\nUsed
    as C's prefix bitwise negation operator; and in Unix csh, GNU Emacs, and elsewhere,
    to stand for the current user's home directory, or, when prefixed to a login name,
    for the given user's home directory.\r\n\r\nThe \"swung dash\" or \"approximation\"
    sign is not quite the same as tilde in typeset material but the ASCII tilde serves
    for both (compare angle brackets)."

  body: "The regular tilde is a diacritic which is combined with other glyphs (like
    n to form \xF1). It is sized and positioned to sit above alphabet characters.\r\nThe
    ascii tilde sits centered on a line in a position aligning with math symbols like
    the equals sign. It is sized to match well with figures. It is used as others
    have said, in coding and as a symbol, (perhaps in linguistics?)."

  body: "Dez: Yup -- in Symbolic Linguistics, it's the \"Not\" or \"Inverse\" operand,
    and <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Geometry/Chapter_3\">apparently</a>
    also in mathematics.\r\n\r\nIn the C programming language it represents a bitwise
    \"not\"; while the logical \"not\" operand \"!\" toggles a value between zero
    and non-zero, the bitwise operand toggles each of the individual bits to their
    opposite. (You probably have to be a programmer to appreciate the difference.)"
