  this font- image shows same font from different angles.  Note the distinctiveness
  of the \"T\" and the \"B\"- I used them as the models when comparing other fonts,
  but I could not find it.   Any ideas?  Thanks ahead to everyone!"

  body: Excellent! I think you nailed it twice there fvilanakis- I agree that it does
    indeed appear to be Marketing Script, by way of Freehand 521 BT, so thank you
    very much.  Thank you also, kthomps5, for the other typeface suggestions.
