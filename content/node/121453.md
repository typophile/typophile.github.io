    letter-forms are quite different but you could find a sans with a similar letter-forms
    and give it the same treatment. The lettering is unusual in that the _S_ is wider
    than _O_, about the same width as _M_.  In other words, all the letters are wide
    except for _O_ and _M_. One solution would be to take a font like Realist Wide
    Medium  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/RealistWideMedAsTea_5764.gif] http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/martinplusfonts/realist-wide/
    or Sweet Sans http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/sans/ and narrow the _O_ and
    _M_.\r\nDon"
