  believe all 15 pages of the original document, prepared in 1983 is in Cambria or
  Century, Microsoft Word on a PC.\r\n\r\nThe inserted name is in a similar font but
  some capitalized letters look slightly narrower, perhaps done 2009 on a Mac.\r\n\r\nIs
  anyone interested or technical enough to help analyze this? It's important.\r\n\r\nContact:

  body: Is 1983 a typo? If not, you need to take into account the technology of the
    period. I'd guess a law firm would have more likely used a Wang or IBM word processing
    machine for preparing long documents, rather than an MS-DOS machine, and for printing
    the document would get fed into a daisywheel printer or Selectric. Fixed-space
    type was still predominant, and choice of proportional fonts was limited and determined
    by the printing device. And Cambria wasn't released until 2007.

  body: If this is a legal matter the court would want to see the original signed
    document, not a photocopy or new printout. I'd ask to see the original, and it'll
    be clear if the name was altered.

    like this, and have seen the original available well less than half the time.
    Forgers are usually smart enough to \"not have\" the original for one reason or
    another."
