  is Sodachrome, a typeface designed by Ian Moore and Dan Rhatigan of <a href=\"http://www.thecolourgrey.com/index.html\">The
  Colour Grey</a> for <a href=\"http://www.sodabudi.com/about/index.html\">Sodabudi</a>,
  a forthcoming online store for artworks inspired by folk art from India. Dan Rhatigan
  blogged about it <a href=\"http://www.ultrasparky.org/archives/2009/03/the_colour_grey.html\">here</a>.
  When the two parts of the typeface are screenprinted in different colours on top
  of each other, they produce a charming effect. Not only is this clever, I think
  it successfully achieves a hand-crafted aesthetic and is fits perfectly for the
  project.\r\n\r\nI used the search function and Google, but this doesn't seem to
  have been mentioned yet on Typophile. It looks like Sodabudi will have an exclusive
  licence for Sodachrome until the end of 2009."

  body: Dan's blog post gives a great explanation of the project. Chromatic fonts
    are not a new concept, but the idea of overlapping two parts to produce a whole,
    and a third image as an added plus, is very original.

  body: Hey everyone, thanks for all the kind words about Sodachrome. It was a really
    fun problem to (try and) solve, and so far it's been a really fun typeface to
    work with, also. Trust me, it really comes to life when you see it use with ink
    and paper! (Hopefully, there will be plenty of ways to show that off soon.)

  body: I have been lucky enough to see some in person with actual ink on paper and
    I can tell you it is even better that way.

  body: Oh, I'd absolutely love to see it in ink and paper. I'll be waiting for the
    sample images at least, even if it doesn't compare with seeing it in person!
