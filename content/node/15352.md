    target=\"new\">Avant Garde Gothic</a> with a small amount of customization by
    merging some of the characters with <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/futura-sh/medium/testdrive.html?s=DOLCE%26GABBANA&p=48\"
    target=\"new\">Futura</a>.\r\n\r\nEither that or someone has created a hybrid
    of the two.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nYes, I'm old,
    but I'm back in style!"
