  body: Looks like a Frank Lloyd Wright adaptation, but after a quick search I couldn't
    match it to anything.

  body: "Looks more like Charles Rennie Macintosh for the double bar A. Art Nouveau
    R and E. Couldn't find much more.\r\n\r\nNo back slanted A -- no Italics to speak
    of. The Slant bar N and Ampersand were not found. \r\n\r\nHere's as couple of
    links anyway: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/rennie-mackintosh/]]\r\n--[[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/CRMFontCo/]]\r\n--[[http://www.crmackintosh.net/product_details.html]]\r\n\r\nThis
    font is called CRMacintosh.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/live1_5903.jpg]\r\nThe
    /L aren't exact copies on the original as well as having a short arm vis a vis
    the /E, so could be handiwork."
