		<div class="commentbody"><p>I saw it, it&rsquo;s really beautiful, and sadly mapmaking is not where it once was. But the ugliness of today&rsquo;s maps is nothing new, as Dutch map-fanatic and designer Joost Grootens says: &ldquo;Maps became ugly with the coming of CMYK printing, which muddled the clarity and atmosphere of a map&rdquo; (beforehand they were often printed using up to 12 spot colors). The vibrancy and crispness of old maps is amazing compared to modern renderings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have a peek if I can get one shipped over!</p>
<p>Next to that, I&rsquo;ll post this great lithographed map by the English art collective Dorothy:

		<div class="commentbody">I have always been attracted by fine map making. Fortunately, the art of it is not dead at all. In Saxony there is [[http://www.boehmwanderkarten.de/kv/is_msto.html|Dr.-Ing. Rolf Böhm]] who draws regional area maps entirely by hand (!) and distributes them. These maps outlevel any competing product in terms of precision and information density while retaining a breathtaking degree of visual balance. I can only recommend to look at his production.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Doing a search on how maps are printed, I couldn&rsquo;t find too much, except information about wax engraving. That technique allowed maps to be drawn as a positive, rather than a negative, image; it was invented by Rand McNally in 1872, and was only displaced by photolithography around 1930.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t really relate to the quality factors noted here, such as hand placement of lettering and the number of colors used in the printing process.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I haven’t seen the Imus map in the paper, but it doesn’t fare too well in the Slate article, vis-a-vis the National Geographic map.
The type looks cluttered, because the designer has been reluctant to vary its alignment by “mapping” it to curved paths, or rotating away from the horizontal. Also contributing to the clutter is a lack of variety of type styles, and the rather generic sans typeface used, which lacks distinction, in more ways than one.</p>
<p>Just because something is labored over in a traditional manner doesn’t make it a good design.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I once imagined a Multiple-Master axis that would vary the &ldquo;keystone&rdquo;
(to borrow a term from projectors) of the letterforms (in a sensitive
way, not just geometrically) and the point on the MM axis would be
chosen by the illustration software based on the curvature of the text
path at that point. The text would look perfect. And no human could
replicate that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I liked the Imus map.</p>
<p>I should note that there is one major difference between it and the Nat&rsquo;l Geo map that shows how it just has different goals. The Nat&rsquo;l Geo map has at least twice as many cities marked on it, maybe more. Having so many places marked seems to me a likely reason why they couldn&rsquo;t show other details that the Imus map does, and need a plain background&hellip;.</p>
<p>That being said, there are some things that just seem better done on the Imus map. I like his approach to marking state borders for example, even if it is rather non-traditional.</p>
