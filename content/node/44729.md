  types sold by Stephenson Blake. The specimen I have has no diacritics, old-style
  figures, or the italic. If you have a specimen book that contains these, would you
  please share the title and year of publication with me?"

  body: "James -- I believe that it was not common for British and American foundries
    of the period to include any accented sorts in their regular fonts. If you look
    in catalogs from this period, you'll find that accents are generally provided
    as loose sorts, sometimes referred to as \"piece\" accents, in the \"typographic
    accessories\" section. My 1926 Stephenson Blake specimen shows loose accents on
    page 89.\r\n\r\nIt's probable that a printer with regular need for accented characters
    could special order composed sorts of specific accented characters for the size
    and typeface of his choosing. The 1923 ATF catalog gives a list of the specific
    fonts & sizes for which they can provide cast accented characters and a generic
    showing of the variety of accents they make available. But they don't have any
    showings for specific faces. \r\n\r\nAlso, I suspect that the accents themselves
    were all cut with generic punches or patterns, with a limited range of styles
    (if indeed any choices), regardless of the face.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n"
