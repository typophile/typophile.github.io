  body: "jrmckean> \r\n\r\n40 Bond is really pretty but for sure its not based on
    Big Caslon. Matthew Carter has not employed the squiggly uppercase Q (looks like
    a pig's tail) in the roman styles of Big Caslon, whereas on the Grammercy Hotel
    site using the same type as 40 Bond does. And just looking at how the axes are
    all over the place in the capital italics- its not a Carter job.\r\n\r\nThe link
    that Lex post correctly attributes this type to a custom Caslon 540. The smaller
    text looks like a non-custom Caslon 540. Too bad the website does not offer a
    pdf on the Hotel then we'd know all.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
