  called \"scorned\" listed among the Font Style dropdown options, along with the
  usuals like bold and regular and whatnot. I left the Font Family field itself blank.\r\n\r\nI'm
  guessing that somewhere on my work computer there's a fancy font that names its
  variants a certain way, and InDesign is merely pulling up all possibilities. (I
  inherited my unit from another layout artist, along with a massive and untidy font
  library.) On the other hand, I still have ways to go in my knowledge of typography,
  so this could well be an obscure convention reserved for certain typefaces. My googlefu
  fails me, though. Please enlighten me, anyone?"

    Sans and Papyrus may indeed meet with scorn from the typographical community,
