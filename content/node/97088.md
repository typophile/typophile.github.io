  body: "For those who are unfamiliar with it, the Hungarian umlaut looks like a double
    acute accent.\r\n\r\nNot directly, no. Hungarian is a central European language
    whose particular accented letters are not supported in a \"standard\" single-byte
    Type 1 font.\r\n\r\nWays to do it:\r\n\r\n- the accent is included in your base
    font, just not the combined letter plus accent. So if you don't have many occurrences
    of it, and your application supports manual kerning, you could enter the base
    character and the accent separately and use manual kerning to move the accent
    over the letter. Word's kerning controls are pretty crude, however, so this may
    not work very well.\r\n\r\n- see if there is a separate CE-encoded version of
    the Type 1 font. It would have a name like \"Bembo CE\" most likely.\r\n\r\n-
    see if there is an OpenType or TrueType version of the font that supports Hungarian
    (and likely other CE languages).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    cumbersome, consider having the character(s) you need added to the font (assuming
    it's from Adobe, or another font house that permits modification). Many people
    on Typophile have experience doing that sort of thing, including yours truly:

    characters are indeed absent.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype-imaging/bembo/1-volume]]\r\n\r\nand
    proceed to the character map, then select the appropriate Unicode range.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    I'm sad to say, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/aldine-401/aldine-401/glyphs.html|Aldine
