  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">A friend asked for help with this, and I&#39;m having a devil of a time identifying this serif font. As you can see, it was used on an urn label. The original label no longer exists, so we can&#39;t get a better image. The mortuary that made it has switched fonts and can&#39;t tell us what they used to use. <BR> <BR>Distinctive things I&#39;ve noted: <BR>- Venetian &#34;e&#34; with slanted crossbar &#40;though the angle it hard to determine&#41; <BR>- &#34;f&#34; has substantial overhang but short crossbar <BR>- Good look at the &#34;b&#34; in the word &#34;Number&#34; where the top serif shape is clear, and you can make out a fairly calligraphic/chiseled shape to the bowl <BR>- &#34;C&#34; has top serif but no bottom serif <BR>- &#34;a&#34; and &#34;c&#34; top terminals have blobby or lachrymal shape. Same for bottom of the &#34;s&#34; <BR>- Short descenders <BR> <BR>We also need to ID the sans face that the label is filled out with &#40;though it might be a typewriter face rather than a font for all I know - it is monospaced&#41;. I haven&#39;t paid much attention to this one yet, but it&#39;s not ringing any bells. Looks a little on the Eurostile side of Helvetica, but monospaced.... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/63477.jpg" alt="Urn label"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">It was my thought too, but I was unsure. But I did a quick comparo in Photoshop and it certainly seems like is indeed plain old Times.  <BR>I think the typewriter font is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/typewriter-gothic-mt/typewriter-gothic-mt/testdrive.html?s=LEONE+LEWIS&amp;p=48" target="_blank">Typewriter Gothic</a> from Monotype.

		<div class="commentbody">Good grief, maybe it is Times... I wonder if they did the label with Letraset and rotated the &#34;e&#34; resulting in some of them being slanted? That would explain a lot. <BR> <BR>As for the sans serif, Monotype&#39;s Typewriter Gothic is certainly much closer than anything else I&#39;ve seen, but still not quite right. The serifs on the &#34;I&#34; are too short, and the center join of the &#34;W&#34; is sharp instead of blunt. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The sans really rings a bell with me. It looks like a word processor or electronic typewriter face that came on daisy printwheels. Such a device might have been used if the mortuary typed or word-processed the information onto a typeset form. <BR> <BR>The face is so familiar I&#39;m sure I have some old printed samples lying around that I could scan in, but I wasn&#39;t able to find any. I was able to find some daisy printwheel catalogs on the internet, however. The best seems to be one available <a href="http://www.officemachinewarehouse.com/media/Printwheel_Catalog.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. <BR> <BR>There aren&#39;t very many sans faces available for those kinds of printers. The particular face in use here has a distinctive squareness to it, which is why it&#39;s reminiscent of Eurostile. The closest face in the catalog is one called Tile. That name seems very familiar &#40;though my memory is quite fuzzy after so many years&#41;. Here&#39;s a sample from that catalog: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif" alt="Tile1012.jpg"> <BR> <BR>The general shape of the letters seems to match, but the samples differ in minor details. &#40;Of course, we&#39;re comparing one scan to another, so it&#39;s hard to tell.&#41; The different printwheel manufacturers copied faces from each other right and left, and they probably didn&#39;t make exact copies &#40;possibly on purpose&#41;. Sometimes they renamed faces. Other sources on the net seem to indicate that a synonym for Tile was Narrator. <BR> <BR>My guess is that it&#39;s Tile or some variation. <BR> <BR>s&#39;marks</div>
