  body: How are you supposed to pronounce that? The example you give is a syllable
    made of already existing sounds. I'd consult the IPA charts and find a sound that's
    not used in the Roman alphabet (African languages, some South American languages,
    etc., have <em>vastly</em> different phonemes than those found in and used by
    the Roman alphabet).
