  body: I would think of a leg as a feature that &#34;stands&#34; on the baseline.
    K and R would have legs. JMO.

  body: I hate these two terms. The distinction I use &#40;which is not necessarily
    standard&#41; is that if the stroke &#39;stands&#39; on the baseline &#40;as John
    said&#41; it&#39;s a leg. If it hangs below, it&#39;s a tail. Usually this means,
    in a serif face, that legs have serifs and tails don&#39;t.  <BR> <BR>So a Warnock
    &#39;k&#39; kas a tail not a leg &#40;it dips slightly below and doesn&#39;t &#39;stand&#39;&#41;.
    So does a Clarendon &#39;R&#39; &#40;which curls upwards at the baseline&#41;.
    &#39;X&#39; and &#39;x&#39; have legs.  <BR> <BR>Most of the time I find that
    if I use the terminology &#39;thingamajig&#39; and &#39;do-lolly&#39; in conjunction
    with pointing, folks understand me just fine.
