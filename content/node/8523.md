  body: 'Miguel,  <BR> <BR>as usual, without an actual example it&#39;s really to
    grasp this theoretical case. So my usual recommendation in such a case:  <BR>
    <BR>1. Put some screenshots illustrating the problem along with the fonts from
    BitFonter and FontLab into one ZIP file.  <BR> <BR>2. Fill in the problem report
    form <a href="http://www.pyrus.com/Font-tools/FontLab-Product-Support/FontLab-Problem-Report/"
    target="_blank">http://www.pyrus.com/Font-tools/FontLab-Product-Support/FontLab-Problem-Report/</a>
    and attach the file there. If the file is larger than 250K, put it somewhere on
    an FTP or WWW site and let us know the URL.  <BR> <BR>This will allow us to resolve
    the matter quicker.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd.'
