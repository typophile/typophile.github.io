  body: "It looks Art Deco-ish to me, but I can't find it in any of the places I hoped.
    Two similar styles were [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/salsa-mangos-btn/|Salsa
    Mangos BTN]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/continental-gothic/|Continental
    Gothic]].\r\n\r\nI have sent a note off to Nick Curtis (an Art Deco expert in
    my book) to see if he recognizes it. \r\n\r\nThe movie was made in 1995 as far
    as I could find, so a font is possible (but not required).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
