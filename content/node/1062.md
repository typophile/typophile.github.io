    target="_blank"> News Gothic</a>, but I have the impression your  <BR>sample is
    partrially distorted, hence the different widths  <BR>of the two &#39;g&#39;s.

  body: Oh, I see it! It&#39;s been screenshot from Adobe Illustrator  <BR>prior to
    version 8. You could do the best bitmapping of  <BR>fonts because ATM forced the
    characters into the monitor  <BR>grid, so when you screenshot your text it was
    perfectly <BR>WYSIWYG. You DID have to visually kern your type though,  <BR>as
    the forcing into the monitor grid distorted the characters  <BR>a bit, with differing
    widths on identical characters as a result.  <BR>Just like in your sample. <img

    Karen, I&#39;ll wait five minutes next time... <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/biggrin.gif"

  body: There is very little difference between News Gothic and Trade Gothic. News
    Gothic was designed by M. F. Benton for ATF hand-set metal. Trade Gothic was developed
    many years later by Jackson Burke as a copy of News Gothic for setting on the
    Linotype system. There are only a few characters which differ noticeably in design
    &#40;the cap &#39;Q&#39; comes to mind&#41;. The main difference, I think, will
    be that the set of Trade Gothic is a little looser due to technicalities of the
    Linotype system.  <BR> <BR>But digital News Gothic varies considerably between
    different foundries. I once provided a quick comparison <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8060.html"

    to try and identify the foundry. <BR> <BR>
