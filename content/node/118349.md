  from Jackson Art \u2014 a pure carbon. It can also be made from the soot from tar
  or resin. This soft shade of black often has a brown tint when used alone, while
  it takes on a blue tint when mixed with white to create grey and is particularly
  useful for colouring dark skies and seas. This <strong><a href=\"http://www.jacksonsart.com/\"

  and can be mixed with other compounds to speed up the process. It is also very stable
  colour."
