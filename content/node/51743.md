body: This is a new font I'm working on. I wanted to make an elegant modern gothic
  with a botanical feel to it (if that makes sense). Kind of like a 'Burtonesque'
  font; romantic yet slightly macabre... As you can see in the example, I used an
  alternate f in the text previews. I have a few other alternate letters I'm still
  working on right now. I like to hear what you think of it.
