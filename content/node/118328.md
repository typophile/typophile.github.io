  font was used a lot in French TV programs in the 1980s - this is a kind of cross
  between Bauhaus 93 and ITC Busorama.\r\n\r\nHere's an example in the opening titles
  of a famous Children's program (from 00:05)\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTINKlCGCq4\r\n\r\nI
  have also posted some screenshots\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your answers!\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n"

    sure it had another pre-digital name--anyone else have any info?"
