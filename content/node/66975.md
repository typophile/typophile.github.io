  body: You are WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL!!!!! Thank you so much for sending me to that
    site. The font is by that designer, but the name of it  is Mon Amour Script. Oh,
    joy, joy. I thought I'd never find out what it was. I don't guess you know what
    that ornament font is with it, do you? Really, a lot of thanks to you.
