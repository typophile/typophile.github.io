    to log in to download the pdf.\r\nThe site also has a slightly better quality
    image than your specimen, but still not clear enough to do more more than guess
    as to the font.\r\nDon"

  body: "hey,\r\n\r\nfirst thanks for looking. and well, you are right - the image
    is really small. i would prefer to download the pdf from scribd - but it costs
    9 dollar and i don\xB4t want wo pay for it - it is only for a small project at
    my university.\r\ni just want to know what font the typo sans serif is - the other
    typewriter style isnt that important.\r\nso here is the part i need to know:\r\n\r\nhttp://img5.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/bildschirmfotolja7v4emh3.png\r\n\r\ni
    hope this is a picture which is big enough. :)\r\n"
