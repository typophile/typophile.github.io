    <BR> <BR>&#40;Since this is typophile&#41; I must say I&#39;m a little  <BR>taken
    back by the inaccuracies of the PRINT article. <BR>But hey, coverage is good. '

  body: I have to say that Eric&#39;s inclusion was one of the few that convinced
    me he deserved to be included. [No offense to the other talented 19] <BR> <BR>And
    <i>Visual Artists</i>? Oy, don&#39;t get me started. <BR> <BR>Congratulations
    Eric.

  body: I&#39;ve been hanging out in the Type I.D. area almost exclusively lately
    and completely missed thread. I also realized I hadn&#39;t even taken the latest
    Print out of the wrapper. Congratulations! <BR> <BR>I agree with Armin about the
    others, too. <BR> <BR>It was a pretty good issue what with the piece on Clearview,
    the one about the type workshop, and the Bruce McCall profile &#40;by the ubiquitous
    Stephen Heller&#41;. McCall is a hero of mine. I was disappointed by the reproduction
    of the illustrations in this article and the general poor design of the features.
    I&#39;m one of those people who thinks graphic design magazines should keep the
    look understated and let the subjects speak for themselves.
