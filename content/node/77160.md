body: "I am currently in the process of designing a logo where their company name
  starts with a Z.\r\n\r\nThey like the zig zag approach to their design philosophy,
  where its not straight logical A to B route of approaching their unique product
  designs. I am trying to find some fonts which represent this, not necessarily a
  Z but a font which represents the zig zag approach. It needs to be a contemporary
  font.\r\n\r\nI have thought of an icon of a lightning bolt which I think it represents
  nicely a zigzag, and extends the idea of \"creative ideas with inspiration\".\r\n\r\nI
  will create word only font without icon as an alternative. Looking for a font I
  can start as a base and will customize the look.\r\n\r\nI didn't put this in the
  type ID font as its more focused on a design question I think :)\r\n\r\nThanks for
  your help in advance."
