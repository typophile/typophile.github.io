  have Latin characters + some custom ligatures + alternate versions + small capitals.\r\n\r\nShould
  I use ISO-8859-1 with additional characters or Unicode ?\r\n\r\nIf using Unicode,
  all the codes seem to be dedicated to some usage. And i'm not sure where to place
  my custom characters. Are there some rules for that ?\r\n\r\nFor example, I put
  my first custom ligature at U+FB07, because the [[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFB00.pdf|unicode
  code charts]] says Latin Ligatures start at U+FB00 with only 7 foreseen. Is that
  the way to do or am I just making to much fuss about this and should I just add
  some extra places at the end of the font for my own needs ?\r\n\r\nPS: I'm using
  FontForge."
