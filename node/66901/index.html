This is from Christopher Burke's excellent "Active Literature" - one of the best book on typography I own. In the final pages Burke shows some very interesting sketches by Tschichold of a sanserif version of Sabon, done around 1960. Burke wrote:

"Despite the dismissive things he wrote about sanserif in his later years, Tschichold seems never to have lost interest in this category of letterform: the first designs he made for his classic typeface Sabon also included a sanserif version, which was never produced. Here he tried to incorporate elements od old-face roman type into sanserif, in a different way than Eric Gill had done, and his sketches show that he anticipated some of the features that surfaced in sanserif types of the 1990s (and later)".

Burke's book is the only place where I have found references to a Sabon sans. A couple of more sketches show some different treatmens of the sans - the shape of the lowercase "a", for example.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sabon_sans02_4037.jpg]


After reading Burke's passage, a question comes to mind: what are the contemporary sans that Tschichold anticipated? On another level, looking at the serif sketch, it is easy to see - for me at least - how the early drawnings of Sabon were much more related to the Garamond model than the official version released in late Sixties.</div>

Except for the bottom-most "a", upon which I
can see you basing a pleasant and significant
design. Even though a single expressive glyph

In fact the only really good reason to actually
make Sabon Sans is because Sabon -a widely
used and very capable typeface- would benefit
from having a sans companion.

		<div class="commentbody">Nicola, thanks for sharing this. Very intriguing! I assume many of you know about Dwiggins' experiment, and Matthew Carter's very similar experiment, also from the 60's. Both seem to have started with a Renaissance serif design and removed serifs. Kent, thanks for showing your trials. Great minds think alike! 

I don't think of Syntax as being as closely related because it's very slightly modulated; it's still clearly a humanist sans. But Meier did eventually develop a semi-serif, Syndor, intended as a hybrid of Syntax and Barbedor. It looks to me like a different path. Vestigial serifs.

There were a bunch of flared sans designs in the 20th century as well as a number of modulated sans designs with an angled stress. Craig brought up [[http://www.typophile.com/node/53266|in this older thread]] a design by Gill with the flared quality, which is more like Stellar, Mentor Sans or Magma. The stressed sans designs like Lydian and Stahl seem to be directly derived from the broad pen, rather than a serif type as a starting point.

Then there are more typographic designs like Amira and Amerigo, which don't seem as much tied to a specific tool or a serif precursor. Clearly there are numerous ways to approach this idea, and the variations make all this experimentation worthwhile. 

Martin, I like your idea in the Trilingual Typography thread that a contrasting sans could fit a niche in a superfamily.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just to split a hair: Syntax and other humanist sans designs adapt the grotesque or monolinear style to the proportions or skeleton of a Renaissance face. The experiments by Lew, Tschichold, Carter etc. are more motivated by the interest in a modulated Renaissance design without serifs. The contrast here is important. 

I think this is worth distinguishing. The results are certainly visibly different. Otherwise why would Martin Majoor be considering it a 4th style in a superfamily like Nexus? </div>

The monolinear sans was rather bland, and the high contrast sans would not, I assumed, be useful to typographers, lacking sufficient contrast against either a serif face, or a sans.

But let me ask you Carl, what kind of layouts do you find Beorcana used in?
Do people use it as a single face, contrasting its different weights, or in tandem with other genres--and if so which?</div>

Maybe because -deep down- <em>Bodoni</em> is bland!
As Ovink said: "Bodoni would be an admirable letter for a death notice."

That makes it even more peculiar that even Martin didn't know about it.

I see more display use than text, but in the US (where I am) I think graphic designers are very conservative about type selection, especially book designers. You noticed the problem with this kind of face: not enough contrast with serif or sans.

I could see Bodoni Sans being boring, but there must be some inspiration in a more lively Modern like Walbaum or Prillwitz. There are already some interesting new grotesques out there, maybe someone can play with contrast more.

I am not saying Jos started at the "wrong" place. In his Fontin his serif design with contrast is derived from his semi-serif, but it could have easily been the other way around. They are both a good basis for the sans. Certainly no negative effects in the results.

In fact these two versions are the 1st and 2nd style, the sans is the 3rd style, which obviously makes the slab the 4th style. Starting with the sans would be starting at the "wrong" place!


By the way, I am definitely going to buy Chistopher Burke's book (and I will ask Fred why he never told me about this great discovery earlier).</div>

I guess I'm asking what Nina is asking, but by trying to

If that's confusing, let me try this: Could you point to a
superfamily that started with a sans, and what specific

I know this is a long-shot - I can't think of any such

Nina, Maybe I can explain it to you by comparing type with a human body and its clothes. In my view the serif design is the human body on which you can put clothes. These clothes could be a sans or a slab or maybe even something else. One thing is sure: the clothes have to fit more or less with the body. After being dressed the body itself becomes almost invisible, only very specific details will be recognized (like long leggs, short arms, a big butt). 

Now, if you start with the clothes (sans serif), what body could be inside? You hardly can't tell because the clothes will hide all details of the body. There could be anybody inside.

If you want to dress Mr. Walbaum, you will come up with a suite that looks like Akzidenz Grotesk. But if you take a suite like Akzidenz Grotesk, you can imagine a whole range of different bodies inside.



> Could you point to a superfamily that started with a sans, and what specific

Hrant, I can give one example of a family that started with a sans: my much adored Syntax. When in 2000 Syntax Serif was released I was very disappointed. Syntax Serif has been forced in a shape that looks artificial and frightened, where Syntax looks strong and self-confident. 

This I found on MyFonts about Syntax Serif: "With this new design, Meier has at last given shape and structure to the invisible muse that inspired him in the 1950s when he conceived his monoline sans serif based on humanist or Oldstyle letterforms."

Nina, I have explained this in my type design philosophy which you can find on my website: http://www.martinmajoor.com/6_my_philosophy.html

Martin, while I can easily understand your point, I guess I just see it as only one way of looking. It makes it sound as though there is a dependency or a dominant-submissive relationship between serif and sans. I don't agree with either. To me, they are just different forms. The sans has less history in calligraphy and more in industry but these things are superficial. I don't see one as being born from another. They are like paternal twins, both from the same family but each true to itself as an individual, whichever one was born first.</div>

I agree to pretty much everything Chris has said in reply. I see how it may appear more intuitive to derive the sans from the serif rather than the other way round – it's the path of formal reduction, plus it parallels history and the phylogenesis of the sans –, but I don't really get the body/clothes thing either, or <em>why</em> you would put the serifed version so much at the heart of the forms that it would be <em>wrong</em> to start at the other side.
I'd worry that the overall approach of only seeing structures based in [traditional] serif faces as «correct» (like with Italics, too, BTW) restricts the «permissible» options in designing fonts very much (and semi-arbitrarily), blocking the view for potentially finding new solutions that also work. <em>Cui bono?</em> </div>

Chris: The serif was born first, that is a fact (I am talking about printing types since 1500). But if the sans - in your view - wasn't born from the serifed typefaces, can you then tell me what the examples were that the punchcutters used to cut the first sanses around 1850?  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">This Sabons Sans thread has taken an interesting direction - a discussion about the relation of sans and serif, and their origins. Since the common opinion about Sans typefaces is that they first appeared in the Nineteenth century (William Caslon), I would like to point you to Sumner Stone's argument about the pre-Roman origin of the Sans, explained in many essays appeared in recent years. In "The Essential Form", for example, Stone states that "Although the recent history of the sans begins only 200 years ago, its earliest appearances are in the simplified drawings which make up the Sumerian and Egyptian scripts of around 3100 BCE." He refers to epigraphic inscription and not to calligraphic letters, by the way. As I already mentioned, I guess Stone's writings on the matter is really interesting; you can check his arguments in the essays "Letters Lost", "Warp and Woof", "The Essential Form" and "Transitions in form the pre-serif letter", here:

?
Why would you look only at printing types?
Frankly it's plain common sense that sans is much older than serif.

But anyway, why would somebody making fonts for today limit
himself with such chronology? Letting history predetermine the
future is not a good plan...

		<div class="commentbody">I’ve been thinking about this since the thread started. Is it not true that these high-contrast sansserifs with calligraphic overtones are a difficult act to balance? Too much contrast and you get pinched corners. Too much calligraphy and you turn into a signpainter and end up with a 1950s casual typeface like Klang. 

I think Formata is not too far away from the original theme of this thread. I think Formata is due for a revival, actually.

		<div class="commentbody">> Why would you look only at printing types?

We are now in the Sabon Sans thread, so I think we are talking about printing types (and especially about serif/sans combinations). A discussion about the first sans is something else.

I did not say that you cannot design a sans serif without starting with a serifed typeface as a basis. There are plenty of examples of good stand-alone sans serifs,  I myself made Telefont (a sans) without first having designed a serifed typeface.

What I ám talking about is that when you design a serif/sans family it is quite illogical to start with the sans. If you have made a sans and later realize you want to add a serifed design (e.g. Meta, Syntax) this is something else, but in the end the two versions are probably further drifted apart from each other than when you start with a serif. 

There are not only historical reasons to start with the serif, but of course everybody is free to determine the starting point. Starting with a sans is illogical but not impossible (Meta, Syntax), starting with both serif and sans makes more sense (Stone Serif and Stone Sans), starting with a serif is the most logical way (see Romulus, Sabon, maybe Syntax, Lucida, Legacy, Scala, Quadraat, Eureka etc.).

By the way I am still curious to know if anybody can tell me what the examples were that the punchcutters used to cut the first sanses around 1850?

I don’t think that anyone knows for sure. The two notions that come up most often are that the British punchcutters were cutting serifs off of their Antiques and that the Germans modeled their designs on Walbaum’s types. Both notions sound plausible, but nobody seems to have turned up notes or drawings from an old foundry to confirm either one.</div>

James Mosley has documented that sans were stone carved and painted for thirty years before the first printers' sans, which was in 1816. [[http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2007/01/nymph-and-grot-update.html|Here is his update to his essay on the subject.]] </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't believe the first sans types were "chop off the serifs" jobs.
The designers' premise was to find the best shape for letters that conformed to the concept of a simple, monolinear typeface.
Of course, they didn't stray too far from the norm of serif letterforms at the time, so the centre crossbar of E was short, and G looked too much like C.

But their working process was probably a lot like ours -- to experiment with individual glyph shapes and find a way to make all the letters work together.

That experimentation is apparent if one compares two different sizes of the Figgins face shown in their 1837 specimen (detail below).
The designer is investigating both geometric forms and what would subsequently become the grotesque. So R in different sizes has 
a straight leg or a curved leg. O is geometric and lacks contrast, which is not the case for N. And so on.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm seeing here in this Miller & Richard specimen book of 1902 a high-contrast sans called "old style grotesque," which by name would appear to be, in concept, a sans patterned after serif faces. But the effect of it is more geometric than Sabon sample above; it looks a bit like a forerunner of the Deco approaches like Broadway/Peignot. 

Stephenson, Blake also in the 19th c. offered an "old style grotesque," but that was a much more stylized display face.</div>
