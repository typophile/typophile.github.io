body: "Hi, I've attached an image containing text that I can't identify. As you will
  see that \u2018G\u2019, \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019 are quite unique in that
  they are low-waisted. Also the \u2018E\u2019 has this characteristic. The 'M' &
  'W' are also full and the 'C' & 'S' don't return far past the top and bottom line....\r\n\r\nI'm
  wondering if anyone can help identify it for me?\r\n\r\nMany thanks, Andrew"

  body: You're right, but it still looks a lot like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/myriad/|Myriad
    Semi Condensed]] (to me).

  body: Sure, I think that is as close as I've seen, Lima. thanks. But I still think
    there is a slight difference  in the weight of the type.
