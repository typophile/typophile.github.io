  body: It looks sort of cobbled together. I seem to recall a while back someone posted
    a sample like this that was parts of Cezanne and various other scripts. The s
    is very familiar. The e looks like a start letter used out of place.

  body: The best thing you could do is license P22 Cezanne and not go looking for
    this exact font as it is derivative and a knock-off.
