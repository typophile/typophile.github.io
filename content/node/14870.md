body: Anyone have any good suggestions for a contemporary Sans Serif font for a telecom.
  Needs to have a full family of wieghts, condensed, etc, very flexible. I've looked
  at Interstate, its cool but It's used by many in the category.

    character and not overused (yet). Also it has a large range of weights, symbols
    and ornaments. You'll find it here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com\r\n\r\nCheers "
