body: This demi roman text font was used from the teens through the thirties on the
  piano roll labels of Rythmodik and then Ampico in NYC and Rochester. It bears many
  similarities to more common fonts, but I have been casually searching without success
  since about 1960. Unfortunately, the lc examples are mostly in about 8pt and get
  blobby. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ampico300_4757.gif]

  body: If so, whose Cheltenham is it? It is clearly not ITC, EF, FB, Old Style, Old
    Style 2, or any other Cheltenham I have seen. Perhaps the punches were hand cut
    by an amateur.

  body: I have now found Cheltenham Bold Headline by bitstream has a similar "s" and
    more which are not present in the other examples I listed. Has anyone older examples
    which might point to the foundry for the foundry Ampico's labels used?
