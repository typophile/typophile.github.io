body: I recently was able to see Helvetica at an AIGA event here in Salt Lake City.
  In the film there is some footage of the manufacturing of messenger bags made from
  vinyl signs. I can't remember the brand attached to them. Does anyone know where
  I might find out who manufactures them? Thanks in advance.

    - I never did get to catch it at the cinema, but have had it pre ordered on DVD
    for a month or so which is allegedly due for release here in the UK on Nov 5th.
    Fireworks *and* a DVD! :)\r\n\r\nWhat's the general opinion of the piece from
    anyone who's seen it? Is it worth my camping underneath the letterbox with Pot
    Noodles and Kendall mint cake?\r\n\r\nsimon"

    thought there was a great amount of diversity among those who chose to speak about
    Helvetica. At the October 16th screening here in Toronto we were treated to a
    fresh-off-the-plane Stefan Sagmeister in the Q&A. The DVD is supposed to have
    an extra 90 minutes of material or something, so you get the coupon clippers award
    (a great award to receive!) for not spending money on an overpriced ticket and
    getting a great doc."

    DVD I'm looking forward to seeing how well it transfers to the small screen. Helvetica
    really only works as a display face at large sizes, so it will be interesting
    to see it on TV. A movie about Verdana, which was designed for the screen at small
    sizes, may work better on TV. ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n"

  body: The director said, at the Q&A, that the DVD contains more Erik Spiekerman.
    That alone makes it worth buying.

    soon as I got the email notification, I could have saved some money -- the Canuck
    dollar skyrocketed after I ordered.  ;-)\r\n\r\nThe world needs more Spiekermann...."

    Helvetica extras at the Typophile FIlm Fest next Friday, the 25th in San Francisco.
    I have seen them all and it will be well worth the DVD purchase :)"
