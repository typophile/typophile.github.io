  body: "The N is from the 'CheapProFonts' updated version of the font. It has this
    'N', which LOOKS like an 'N', unlike the original. The new version also modifies
    a few other characters, including the M, m, n, and  t.\r\n\r\nKrizia Uomo was
    created by Levi (Levente) Halmos. It has since been expanded upon, with his approval
    by someone else, and renamed to Krizia Amo in a commercial version (US$10) with
    353 glyphs  and an unbelievable 16, 459 kerning pairs! As seen here: \r\nhttp://www.cheapprofonts.com/Krizi_Amo_Pro\r\n\r\n

    Krizia (http://www.krizia.it)? ;-)"

  body: I'd bet that Halmos never obtained their approval either (or even tried to).
