  super-family, a sans serif-version of the original Sofa design with heavy serifs.\r\n\r\nThere
  is not too much to say about it, mainly I have clipped serifes away and have redesigned
  the now-nude line endings. This was done for all except ligatures and some glyphs
  I've forgotten so far.\r\nSpacing probably is too loose at the moment.\r\n\r\nAny
  comments on mistakes I've made when removing the serifs, and general annotations
  are appreciated.\r\n\r\nSebilar\r\n\r\n<strong>More members of this family</strong>\r\n<a

  body: "You are right, Scala Sans has some similarities (haven't noticed this yet).\r\n\r\nIt's
    no modification of Scala, but was derived from <a href=http://typophile.com/node/17136>Sofa
    Serif</a>, which is based on a drawing of mine. But of course there are influences
    from post-modern typedesign Scala belongs to.\r\nMy first thought when drawing
    was \"how would Formata Serif look like?\", but I think it has left this initial
    thought, while working on it."

  body: "This is great - lots of feedback for you...\r\n\r\nI know you haven't tightened
    spacing yet (its good loose!) but, relatively speaking is there too much space
    on A? E and F right sidebearings loose?\r\n\r\nPlus (in no particular order)...\r\n\r\nApostrophe
    (quoteright) seems to be a quoteleft in pdf?\r\n\r\nLower arm of k seems optically
    thinner than upper arm? Upper case seems OK.\r\n\r\nu (and mu) seems considerably
    narrower than n and h? Maybe optical?\r\n\r\nbreve light compared to other accents?\r\n\r\nDots
    on i and j too heavy? Are they same as period?\r\n\r\n2 (and perhaps 7) looks
    wide compared to other numerals?\r\n\r\nDo arms of multiply deliberately not cross
    at right angles?\r\n\r\nStroke at the top of the 1 seems inconsistent with the
    rest of the typeface? Tapering is a new treatment (except in accents such as grave,
    acute, circumflex, caron etc) I can't find another shape like it. Can't it be
    like other characters? Something like this (I have deliberately left the arm quite
    long to help with tabular numerals)...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SofaSans1.gif]\r\n\r\nArms
    of E and F seem narrow compared with horizontals in D?\r\n\r\nt seems very hooked
    compared with f and j etc?\r\n\r\nCrossbar on T looks very straight (less organic
    than other 'straight' strokes, eg arms of E and L.\r\n\r\nAcute on Lacute is drifting
    left? Looks right on small caps lacute.\r\n\r\nBar on Tbar drifting left? Looks
    right on small caps tbar.\r\n\r\nDotaccent is lower on characters than dieresis?
    Both are lower than dot on i. Would the position of the dot accent be governed
    by the dot on either the i or the dieresis... it's neither.\r\n\r\nNumerators
    and denominators look small? Also the 1 (numerator, denominator, superscript and
    subscript) looks very bold compared to other numerators (and you already know
    my thoughts on the 1).\r\n\r\nQuestionmark (?) seems to be falling over to the
    right at the top. Same with inverted question but bottom left.\r\n\r\nBeautiful
    work!\r\n"

  body: "Thanks a lot for this detailed feedback, Nick.\r\nThat motivates me to go
    on right when I have the time to do so, but for now... I have to sleep (3am here
    now, forgot time while working on a Antiqua variation).\r\nI'll have a closer
    look and give a more detailed and adequate answer tomorrow, but for short: I think
    you are right in almost every point.\r\n\r\nsebilar"

  body: "Nick, sorry for my late answer.\r\nI've found out that I first have to finish
    <a href=http://typophile.com/node/17136>Sofa Serif</a> before I can work on with
    sans, as there are too many cross-links between the two fonts. If I change one
    detail in the first one, I have to do it in the second one too. This ends in madness...\r\n\r\nBut
    I could make use of a lot of your comments on Sofa Serif as well, as they are
    applicable on the general design, not only on one part of the family. You can
    see some of my changes based on your comments on V25 of Sofa Serif already. I've
    left out the ones concerning Diacritics, as they change and shift too often at
    the moment. I'll do them right when finishing the font.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for
    that,\r\nsebilar"
