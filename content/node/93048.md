body: Please help identify a font that would emulate a US Civil war era period letter
  style used by US newspapers (New York Times) and books or other publications of
  the time. Also, interested in knowing if there was an UC/lc letter style typically
  used for signage in public buildings of the time. I know Baskerville was used by
  the government for a time, but don't know if the use extended into the 1850's. I
  intend to use the font to carve a quote by Mr. Lincoln into wood and would like
  to be correct to the period. Thank you!

    called \"modern\" faces, similar to Bodoni. (A 21st-Century version is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/regular/|Scotch
    Modern]]).\r\n\"Modern\" faces have extremely thin horizontal strokes and hairline
    serifs, so they'd be a b**** to carve in wood. I'd recommend some of the heavier
    display faces popular in Lincoln's time, such as [[http://www.woodentypefonts.com/Pages/egyptbld.html|Egyptian
    Bold]], [[http://www.identifont.com/similar?49A|Latin Bold]], or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/clarendon/|Clarendon]].\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    them) began showing up in the 1830s. The Egyptian Bold referenced above was alternately
    called Ionic, and  Clarendon came in several flavors, neither of which was quite
    like the sample referenced. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/clarendon-condensed-bold/\"
    target=\"_blank\">English Clarendon</a> dates from around 1845, while French Clarendon\u2014more
    like Barnum or Playbill\u2014didn't arrive until around 1865. Grecian is another
    style which emerged in the 1840s."

  body: "Although newspapers were most often set in a Scotch Modern style of type
    in the early 1860s, modernized Caslons, usually called Old Style, were often used
    for some kinds of publications, especially books and magazines with literary pretensions.
    Examples of this style include Old Style 7 and Bruce Old Style.\r\n\r\nPublic
    buildings back then tended to have much less signage than now; either you knew
    where you were going, or you asked someone. However, where signage was necessary,
    it would probably have been hand-painted by a professional sign painter. The display
    types that Victor and Nick have described are generally derived from sign painters'
    lettering; they would be much easier to carve in wood than the text faces of the
    era. All-cap bold sans serifs or Tuscans would have been common, with hand-painted
    compositions often making use of curved baselines."

  body: "This has been a great help! As a newbie to the world of typography, reading
    through these and other posts has been quite educational (and mildly addictive).
    Since I will be carving this in flat stock, I need to use a lighter weight letter
    style and will need to stay away from the display or slab selections. In carving
    the letters, the play of light on the carved letters is one key to a good result.
    Carvers often work with a 60 degree v-groove to create a shadow --essentially
    \"coloring\" the letter. When working with a more open v-groove, the shadows can
    be washed out and make the lettering difficult to see and read. Working with a
    larger overall letter size and a 60 degree v-groove on a thick letter style could
    mean I would carve right through the piece. One of the text styles should work
    well, but I might need to take some artistic license and thicken up the thinner
    lines a bit. Now all I need to do is choose!\r\nThank you all."

    Still, it does not seem to be a perfect fit. Any thoughts? Thanks!!"
