  body: It is a custom font called &#39;Stratos&#39;. As a former Boeing employee
    I was aware of that because they told us that formal documents had to use it for
    certain pages, in certain contexts. <BR> <BR>There are probably a number of heavier
    weight squared sans serif fonts, such as Font Bureau <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FB00000234P1"
    target="_blank">Agency Wide</a>, that could resemble this if they are slanted
    properly and spaced somewhat tightly.
