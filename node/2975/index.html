There's a strict hierarchy in Flatland (the more sides you have the higher up you are - but in a 2D world, the shapes can't see each other from above, so they have to judge the number of sides by finding a corner and checking the angles. Women are bottom of the pile, so they are, I think, just lines). I read it a very long time ago, for an undergrad essay I was writing, but I can't remember much of it (or even what f*cked up type of essay I was writing in which this wierd book could play a part). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you're interested, its around $2 at most online bookstores, or there's an online version here <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.alcyone.com/max/lit/flatland/">http://www.alcyone.com/max/lit/flatland/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or there's also a Project Gutenberg version available at their website. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've only read the .txt version with ASCII illustrations, the originals are supposed to be very nice, but I never got round to searching them out.

For what seemed like hours, I was trying to organize folders/files on my hard drive and could never get them organized. This was after a long day of moving icons and other files around on my HD. I had the same dream a couple of times, but haven't had anything like it recently.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the reimnder of Flantland. I recall my grandmother telling me about that book years ago. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had a design professor in College who told us he would have dreams about a particular version of Bodoni. I thought it was strange at the time, but I've since come to understand. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He also converted an alleyway into an office space for his studio and actually petitioned the city to let him have 666 as his address because he liked the graphic possibilities with three numbers being the same. He was wearing Mephistopheles brand shoes when he told us. Hmmm&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Since I've been designing on a computer every day for 14 years, my thinking has become irretrievably altered. Now my dreams &quot;scroll&quot; vertically, instead of moving left to right as I remember they used to do.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lately, I was hand drawing a thumbnail on a piece of paper. Then off to the bottom left corner (as if it were the pasteboard), I drew a bit that I had every intention of moving over to the center. I actually stuck the pencil in the middle, held it down, and was momentarily surprised when my side scribble didn't click and drag.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Similarly, I've drawn thumbnails and gotten pissed that I couldn't &quot;send to the back.&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I age and move into perimenopause, there are ever increasing numbers of floating pallets to deal with. That's a deadly combo to my brain cells.  I started noticing this 5 versions of Freehand ago. Now I'm convinced InDesign is going to land me in a nursing home.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Funny. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's very interesting how particulars of software interfaces migrate to our physical interfaces - probably due to the amazing adaptability of the human brain. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; was momentarily surprised when my side scribble didn't click and drag. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One time I was working on a scan of a photo laying to the left of the keyboard. I was trying to show a coworker some difference between the scan and the original - with the mouse I pointed to the area on the scan, then I proceeded to try to roll the pointer off the bottom-left of the screen to the physical photo on the table. I actually got angry for a second when it wasn't working. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And it's not just software, but anything you spend a lot of time with. When I used to have a motorcycle, riding it more than I'd walk, I used to catch myself looking to my left (where the mirror would be) even when I was on foot, to see what's behind me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
