  \"I Spy.\"\r\n\r\nCould someone help me identify the fonts used on the cover, and
  perhaps recommend something similar (doesn't need to be exact, the words wont be
  'I Spy').\r\n\r\nHere's an image of said cover\r\nhttp://buy.overstock.com/images/products/bnt/FC0590462954.JPG\r\n\r\nAny
  help is appreciated, thank you"

    they used, I'd suggest <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/bellini-rr/bellini-condensed-rr-bold/testdrive.html?s=I+SPY+FANTASY&p=48\"
    target=\"new\">Bellini Bold Condensed</a> for the I SPY part. Maybe some 'squooshing'
    would be in order for fitting, the way the book title was done. All the black
    lettering below that looks like good old Bembo. The orange type might be Bembo
    Bold, but it's hard to see details well in the sample.\r\n\r\nAnother I SPY replacement
    might be <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/la-bamba/la-bamba/testdrive.html?s=I+SPY+FANTASY&p=48\"
    target=\"new\"> LaBamba</a>, which is a bit more 'fun' looking. \"Spumoni\" or
    \"Elroy\", would also be 'fun' fonts for the main title.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: BudNull looks like a bad autotrace. I'd guess there is some other source,
    probably pre-digital.

  body: I think this font is indeed in the pre-digital dustbin. I remember it from
    a 1986 book I worked on called "Dining in France" that I threw away last week.
    That book probably had a colophon identifying the font but alas it too is in the
    dustbin.

    the 1972 VGC catalog, and a few PLINC brochures and found nutin' --  still, it
    doesn't seem so completely unique that at least some source could be found. Hmmm...
