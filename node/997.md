  body: Heh...I&#39;ve only been here a short while, but from what I&#39;ve seen I
    like Hrant.  Of course, I&#39;ll never, ever show him any of my designs, I don&#39;t
    think I could take it, but it is fun to watch him critique other people as well
    as interact with the other strong personalities on the board.

  body: Jon, I agree with everything you wrote in your truly  <BR>brilliant open letter,
    which had me laugh out loud  <BR>on various occasions and somehow moved me to
    a  <BR>certain extent, silly me. Because although Hrant can  <BR>occasionally
    get on my nerves as no one else can and  <BR>infuriate me to unknown levels, I
    firmly believe that  <BR>this - kinda - tribute is deserved. Because I&#39;ve
    got  <BR>a gut feeling that Hrant is one of the good guys, and  <BR>no amount
    of online abuse will convince me of the  <BR>contrary. Me like him too. <BR> <BR>And
    really, there&#39;s nothing Hrant can throw at you  <BR>that a healthy dose of
    self-relativation and a good  <BR>sense of humour won&#39;t help you through.
    Some people  <BR>need to stop taking themselves too seriously. <BR> <BR>P.S. I
    read and reread this entry numerous times  <BR>to make sure that there was nothing
    that might  <BR>elicit a response from Hrant, can you believe it? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif"

  body: I&#39;ve always had great respect for Hrant. He&#39;s always offered honest,
    straightforward critiques of my work, and that&#39;s exactly what I post my works
    in progress to receive. Hrant is one of the best things about the critiques section,
    and I always enjoy reading his discussions and contributions to the other boards
    as well. His comments are indeed provocative, which in my opinion is the best
    kind of discussion. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not at all sure what happened on the thread
    between Hrant and Gerald Giampa, but I&#39;ve noticed that Hrant has been missing
    from the discussion and critique boards since then. I hope he returns. If not,
    Typophile.com will have lost a useful voice. <BR> <BR>David

    to think we are friends. He is honest, trusting, trustworthy, generous, kind,
    and forgiving. And quite mild-mannered!!! He is geniunely interested in intellectual
    effort and a search for truth. There is no ego-centric crap going on with him.
    He is quite genuine. If he says it, you can take it as his word. <BR> <BR>Gerald

  body: Folks, <BR> <BR>I heard you chaps don&#39;t like my humour. Then you are really
    going to like this. It&#39;s not funny. <BR> <BR>First of all I think all of us
    respect and have heard of John Hudson. I am sure he too is sympathetic with your
    buddy, probably he too thinks I am a little pissed off and you know something.
    He just might be right about that. <BR> <BR>But if you think John Hudson and Ross
    Mills would be involved in type making without my encouragement you are wrong.
    Does that tell you anything? <BR> <BR>If Hrant keeps people like Erik Spiekermann,
    Joseph D. Treacy, Jim Rimmer,  myself and only God knows who else that does not
    bother to contribute because of his puerile, ego centric, insulting attacks just
    because they don&#39;t believe the unbelievable, you are better off without the
    clan member. <BR> <BR>One thing I can assure you all this tear jerking is just
    a lot of wasted  drama. Hrant does nothing but write in the Forum his two cents
    on virtually anything, and everything he knows nothing about.  <BR> <BR> <BR>His
    work is truly boring at best and rest assured that he is thoroughly addicted to
    this culthood of button pushers that I predict he could never be gone for long
    enough. <BR> <BR>His Pascal &#34;fantasy&#34; is crap supported by a letterpress
    spokesman that could never have ever found gainful employment in a real print
    shop. His press work is good but it is done, from what I can make of it, on a
    press that is idiot proof by design. I hope I am wrong, a proof press. I would
    be much happier if it were something more. <BR> <BR>He should try a 32 page book
    forme on a 44 inch semi automatic cylinder press and see how he cuts the mustard,
    any bets? Believe me, it will quickly separate the men from the boys. He is an
    enthusiastic hobby printer at best resting on his laurels. He obviously knows
    nothing about Linotypes, Monotypes, or he would not spout such uninformed material
    in his teachings to boo hoo Hrant. He knows little to nothing of type cutting
    which is clearly indicated by his sitting in the bleachers of Hrants cheering
    section. If he believes what Hrant tells him then he too, is just passing wind.
    If he believe in the &#34;Pascal Fantasy&#34; the man is an idiot. <BR> <BR>I
    put more impressions through my hands in one month that he ever did in his entire
    life span. He prints mainly by polymer which does not give authentic entitlement
    of any expertise as a letterpress printer. I know, he has played with a little
    type in a California job case, maybe printed Christmas cards on a treadle hand
    fed platen press. Nothing wrong with that. But his preference towards  polymer
    leans towards what I deem to be low grade material. Or more rudely put, &#34;buyer
    beware material&#34;. <BR> <BR>Putting it bluntly how many ems per hour can this
    man set? I know my money would not go on Gerald Lange in a typographical horse
    race. People you have never heard of outperform and know more than he. Common
    run of the mill letterpress printers. <BR> <BR>That been said I think Gerald Lange
    had a great opportunity. Now, after his tear jerking to comes to pass, if he ever
    comes to his senses, he will of wished he had been a little more diplomatic in
    his handling of myself in particular. I am not a nut case belonging in an institute
    thank you all very much. I have made a tremendous contribution to this industry
    and further if he considers me to be &#34;a has been&#34; as does his bossum buddy
    boo hoo Hrant, may I suggest the following, he is &#34;a never has been&#34;.
    So he will never have anything to be &#34;nostalgic about&#34;. Get my point.
    So before it is to late, you cry babies should welcome Jim Rimmer, Joe Treacy,
    and myself to speak our piece. Gerald Lange should have welcomed us. You know
    why he did not, he is too busy protecting his pecking order. But is about to miss,
    taking you with him, a rare opportunity to leap frog your knowledge far beyond
    what previously has been available to you. <BR> <BR>The opportunity is passing
    before your very eyes, an opportunity that will never again show its face because
    some of us &#34;middle aged&#34; &#34;Honky&#34; &#34;White &#34;Male&#34; punchcutters
    are going to give up on you all. <BR> <BR>So do not waste your time with a phoney
    60 hr letterpress expert. There is no such thing. <BR> <BR>I KNOW LITTLE OF THE

  body: This is a very weird thread, but since my name has been mentioned, here are
    my thoughts. <BR> <BR>Over the years, in various forums, I&#39;ve had many violent
    clashes with Hrant, often prompted by him saying something incredibly insulting
    about someone else. I&#39;m not going to go over the history, but one of my objections
    has always been that his mode of hectoring discourse puts people off and stifles
    contribution from people who might like to engage with the topic under discussion,
    but do not wish to do so in the way in which Hrant discusses things. I don&#39;t
    buy Hrant&#39;s suggestion that these people lack confidence or need to develop
    stronger spines. In a civil society, people who value discourse work to create
    an environment in which such discourse can flourish. This is not some kind of
    Darwinian debating society in which only the most &#39;confident&#39; &#40;loudest,
    most prolific, most thick-skinned&#41; survive. I don&#39;t claim to always manage
    to create a good environment myself -- I can be as abrasive as Hrant --, but unlike
    him I do see my failings as failings, and not as virtues. I believe that we have
    an obligation to foster broad and open discourse, and this will often require
    us to adjust the way in which we engage in that discourse ourselves. Typically,
    this implies nothing more onerous than being polite.

    plausible, but is in fact profoundly wrong. First of all, all societies have standards
    of politeness in them, and traditional societies are more courteous, not less,
    than Western society. &#40;Incidentally, putting tolerance as practically the
    sole social virtue is a typical American and even more typical L.A. mistake.&#41;   <BR>
    <BR>Furthermore, there is a unifying idea to politeness, even though its forms
    vary in different cultures. That unifying idea - according to the antropologists
    who wrote the book &#39;Questions and Politeness&#39;, and studied politness in
    different cultures - is avoiding embarassment to the other person in a discussion.  <BR>
    <BR>Is saying something that belittles the other person helpful to furthering
    debate? No. Is it harmful? Very often, yes, because it diverts the subject or
    stops debate or drives people away.  <BR> <BR>What I want to make clear is that
    Hrant&#39;s &#39;cultural&#39; defense doesn&#39;t hold water at all. But, as
    is usually the case with any passionately held view, there is a kernel of truth
    in Hrant&#39;s view, even though as explicitly formulated it is quite wrong.  <BR>
    <BR>The manners of debate are not an easy thing. Socrates is definitely a gadfly
    stinging people in Plato&#39;s dialogues, as John Coltz notes, and not a model
    of politeness or gentleness.  <BR> <BR>As &#39;Questions and Politeness&#39; points
    out, one of the problems is that debate aimed at uncovering the truth requires
    clarity, and politeness often requires ambiguity and vagueness, so as to avoid
    giving offence.  <BR> <BR>Now hard hitting debate aimed at the truth, which keeps
    on the topic and is not openly personal at all, can give offense. This is because
    if the person is a professional in the subject, then their professional standing
    is partly at question when their views or work is questioned. This aspect of politeness
    must indeed be compromised for a forum like this to be useful.  <BR> <BR>And in
    this respect Hrant&#39;s view, though misguided, has an element of truth in it:
    to participate in a rational debate about the substance of something you care
    about requires a willingness to take some lumps. In fact, this is why Western
    society is less polite than traditional societies - in which all argument is regarded
    as rude. It is the Socratic heritage of valuing debate aimed at the truth so much
    that people should swallow their pride to learn from it.   <BR> <BR>However, arguments
    to the person, rather than the topic, serve no purpose in discovering the truth,
    and in fact impede it.  <BR> <BR>The rule that will best serve for all of us to
    learn on this board is in fact very simple:  <BR> <BR>Stay on the topic and don&#39;t
    get personal.  <BR> <BR>Now when I sinned recently in this respect on another
    thread, I was reminded that it is especially easy to misconstrue and take and
    give offence in ASCII. And therefore I think we have to take special care to act
    with the courtesy as we would with the person being in the room, and not thousands
    of miles away. For over time a community like this will in fact meet each other.
    And in any case this will further productive discussion. Who was that sage who
    warned me of the dangers of &#39;ASCII-itis&#39;? Oh, yeah I remember - Hrant.  <BR>
    <BR>What to do when someone does get personally insulting or tediously irrelevant.
    Another second rule: be silent. So, in answer to Jon Coltz question, if it is
    Hrant Hyde rather than Hrant Jeckle, silence is appropriate. Don&#39;t take the
    bait! <BR> <BR>Now I am certainly a repentent sinner on these issues, as John
    Hudson says he is also, but I think the rules that help a debate forum like this
    are the simple ones I have stated.  <BR> <BR>1. Stay on topic and don&#39;t get
    personal.  <BR>2. Be silent and don&#39;t take the bait when someone is insulting.
    <BR> <BR>These will serve to handle, dare I say it, the &#39;Rant&#39; in all
    of us, and keep discussion productive.    <BR> <BR>  <BR> <BR>   <BR>'

  body: 'Thank you for the thoughtful post, William. I would like to expand on one
    point you made, partly because I think it might be misinterpreted and partly because
    it is a useful example of the distinction between &#39;hard hitting debate aimed
    at the truth&#39; and personal attack aimed at demeaning someone. <BR> <BR>As
    you note, when engaged in a debate and claiming any kind of expert status based
    on experience or occupation, one puts one&#39;s professional reputation on the
    line to a certain extent. This happens as a matter of course, although it is unusual
    for someone&#39;s reputation to be destroyed in such debate or even more than
    temporarily tarnished. That it happens as a matter of course is an important point,
    because it helps us to contrast the intrinsic vulnerability of professional reputation
    in honest and focused debate of a topic against an open attack on an individual&#39;s
    reputation as a means of shifting focus from the topic -- and from that individual&#39;s
    views on the topic -- onto the person. In the first case, an individual&#39;s
    reputation sustains collatoral damage from an attack on his ideas. In the second
    case, the reputation is attacked directly in order to undermine confidence in
    the ideas. I&#39;ve seen Hrant perform the latter manoeuvre numerous times: if
    someone disagrees with him -- or, sometimes, if he imagines that someone might
    disagree with him: actual knowledge of the other person&#39;s ideas does not seem
    to be a prerequisite --, he will attempt to undermine the reputation of that person.
    As one example, he did this on Typophile not long ago when I mentioned the presentation
    on the psychology of word recognition that Microsoft&#39;s Kevin Larson will be
    giving at ATypI. Not content to wait to hear what Dr Larson has to say on the
    subject, from the position of a PhD in cognitive psychology specialising in empirical
    studies of reading, Hrant almost immediately called into question Larson&#39;s
    professional conduct by suggesting that he was telling Microsoft what they were
    paying to hear. It is this kind of attack that I find most offensive in Hrant&#39;s
    mode of discourse.'

    Wednesday, June 25, 2003 - 12:53 am was exactly correct. <BR> <BR>You apparently
    have problems yourself but express them differently. Equally as objectionable.
    <BR> <BR>The resulting attack on Joe, who by the way is a very nice guy was certainly
    undeserving. I think I have made myself fairly clear on that matter. However it
    appears difficult by the injections from the &#34;nipple sucking cult kittens&#34;
    to feel confident of that. <BR> <BR>Before you suspect I am getting personal here.
    I am not attempting to be, but I am hindered by the very nature of this discussion
    itself. <BR> <BR>Since coming to Joe&#39;s defence I have had a sudden surge of
    disturbing e-mails.  <BR> <BR>There are motions to turn the tap off from serious
    outside contributions. To start a closed forum. Initially this was inviting and
    encouraging. But there is one thing that does not work for me. I enjoy sharing
    things I know with my peers, certainly love to learn new things. And don&#39;t
    even mind finding out that I may have been wrong about some things, all of this
    is exciting for me. Also in the same way I enjoy learning from children, I enjoy
    learning from beginners. Believe me trying to explain how things are done is one
    thing, but the question &#34;why&#34; can sometimes be cause to pause. I remember
    teaching someone on a press and realized that I had not be doing it wrong, but
    I could have been doing it quicker and easier. That lesson had a payday every
    time I started my press. Also as with children I have always wondered who brings
    up who? <BR> <BR>So I enjoy, as John will attest to, the spirit of sharing my
    enthusiasm with people who are new or continue to learn about the industry. &#40;I
    include myself as one that continues to learn&#41; That is what I enjoy the most.
    That is the only reason that I began to write into the Typophile Forum in the
    first place. <BR> <BR>So my gut re-action is strongly against a closed forum and
    have expressed as much. <BR> <BR>By expressing my objections to this new motion
    I have been faced with an argument that has left me with out answer. <BR> <BR>&#34;but
    Typophiles is a closed forum&#34;. <BR> <BR>So until that has changed this middle
    aged &#34;Honky&#34; male punch cutter is out of here. <BR> <BR>Hrant, <BR> <BR>And

    Since we&#39;re all <i>people</i> after all, there can be no real debate outside

    the onus is on people not being so anxious to feel offended. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    tempting -and maybe often religiously necessary- to apply universality to a group

    capacity of that group of people. Instead of making others conform, excercise
    your ability to adapt. If there should be any universal quality enforced, it should
    be candor - because <i>communication</i> is much more important than restraint
    in solving problems. Don&#39;t spend most of your life stopping yourself from
    doing things that feel right. &#40;I don&#39;t [necessarily] mean &#34;you&#34;
