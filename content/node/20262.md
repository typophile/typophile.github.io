      given the source, I'm inclined to think that this is a standard or free font."

  body: "What numerals? I don't see any in your samples?\r\n\r\nI still think it's
    Univers, it's hard to be certain due to the ink bleeding and distortion caused
    by printing onto fabric.\r\n"

  body: "I'm sorry, please excuse my lack of knowledge in the typography world.\r\nI've
    just never run into Univers before. Basically what I mean by \"the source\" is
    that if the font isn't included with an operating system or an Adobe product,
    the person who created this probably wouldn't go out and look for it.\r\n\r\nAnd
    as for being printed on fabric, you are correct. I'm a screen printer trying to
    re-create someone else's work. Not only will a bleed occur, but a loss of detail
    or choke can occur too. That may be the case here.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_5248.jpg]"

    Gothic</a> from URW++ looks like a match minus the parentheses.
