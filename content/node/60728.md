body: A Serif typeface I've been developing based on the golden ratio, I've drawn
  inspiration from Didot and looked at modernising some of the serifs. Some of the
  characters still need some work but I think it's on its way. love to hear thoughts,
  suggestions

  body: "Looks good!\r\n\r\nThe 't' looks off, I think the ascender is to high, but
    maybe that's intentional. Also, the 'z' does not quite fit in my eye, maybe it's
    too geometric? "

  body: "I think it looks pretty good!\r\n\r\nJust to comment on a couple of things:\r\n1)
    I find the serif on the 'leg' of the a disturbing (it is quite different from
    the rest of the serifs...?)\r\n2) I agree with Marco that the z doesn't fit properly
    yet...it looks too 'square' compared to the rest of the characters.\r\n\r\nBut
    overall a good job!"

  body: "What Kevin (cerulean) said; plus, I think the left leg of the \u2018x' will
    need adjusting a bit (up and/or left) to counteract that optical illusion making
    it look offset (low) relative to the right arm. \r\n \r\n\u2018k' is quite Walbaumy.\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver
