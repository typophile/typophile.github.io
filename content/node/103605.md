body: "The inserted image is the text below a 19th century painting of a comet above
  a Czech town that appeared in a Czech journal or magazine.  I intend to enlarge
  it, print it (fine art quality on quality paper), and frame it - the image quality/resolution
  will allow this.  However, the text quality is poor and enlargement will only make
  it worse, as we all know.  I tried unsuccessfully to find the font in order to re-type
  it by posting it on multiple font ID sites/forums.  There were several close suggestions
  but the numerals never matched and this was a problem because I'm quite fond of
  those characters, in particular.  Then one sharp-eyed professional pointed out that
  this text was almost surely hand-lettered, not type set, because similar characters
  have too much variation from one to another.  So, I'm wondering how much trouble
  it would be to make a font based on this hand lettering in order to retype it under
  the image in acceptable quality?  I have limited experience in this field (OK, almost
  none at all).  I hear/read that Scanfont might be a solution?  If this route is
  the one to take, could I just make a limited font with only the '1', '5', and '8'
  numerals that I can not find matches for, to use mixed with one of the suggested
  fonts that otherwise does closely match?  If this is a good solution and anyone
  is up to the task, please contact me (I would be wiling to pay a reasonable fee
  for services rendered).  Although this is not a 'font ID' query, if anyone knows
  of a font that matches those numeral, I'm obviously all ears.  Likewise, other creative
  solutions to this problem.  Thanks. \r\n\r\n-MG[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text_5990.jpg]"

    would take maybe a couple of hours.\r\nThe reason is the light weight of the characters,
    enabling the construction method of drawing a path and stroking it.\r\n"

  body: Thanks Nick, it's encouraging to hear that this is a viable solution and can
    be done in that time=money frame.
