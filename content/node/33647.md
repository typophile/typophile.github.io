body: "Andreas St\xF6tzner and the German DIN committee submitted a proposal to the
  ISO 10646 working group that <strong>uppercase \xDF</strong> (germandbls, [[eszett]],
  sharp s) should be added to Unicode/ISO 10646. \r\n\r\n<strong>U+1E9E</strong> is
  the envisioned codepoint.\r\n\r\nThe proposal can be viewed at: \r\nhttp://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/N3227.pdf\r\n\r\nIt
  is important to note that according to the proposal, even after adding this character
  to Unicode, the <strong>standard uppercase mapping for \"\xDF\" will remain \"SS\"</strong>.
  This encoding effort is not about changing existing application or even spelling
  rules -- it is simply an effort to encode a character to be used in an \"alternate\"
  spelling which some people use (and currently have problems with properly encoding
  the text). It is an observed fact that \"uppercase \xDF\" exists, even if the official
  rules don't envision it. \r\n\r\nI believe it is an interesting effort, and it would
  be reasonable to discuss what the best possible shape for the new character would
  be. \r\n\r\nSome links in German:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.signographie.de/cms/signa_9.htm
  (published by Andreas St\xF6tzner, I recommend reviewing all the PDFs published
  there.)\r\n\r\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versal-Eszett\r\n\r\nSome German type
  designers posted some of their design proposals for an uppercase \xDF at:\r\nhttp://www.typeforum.de/modules.php?op=modload&name=XForum&file=viewthread&tid=353\r\n\r\nI
  find many of these design proposals structurally flawed -- they don\u2019t look
  like uppercase letters. They look like lowercase letters enlarged to match uppercase.
  The graphical structure of the Roman uppercase is very different from lowercase.
  If one were to invent a new uppercase letter, it would have to stylistically match
  the Roman uppercase. If Unicode really decides to encode uppercase \xDF, type designers
  should imagine what the uppercase \xDF would have looked from the very beginning,
  rather than trying to work out of the existing lowercase \xDF form.\r\n\r\nNote
  that the <strong>history of \"\xDF\"</strong> is somewhat surprising. The letter
  developed in a two-wise way: as a ligation of long s and round (\"normal\") s, and
  as a ligation of long s and z. The German language adopted unified spelling rules
  only in 1901. Before that, both in the middle ages and in the humanist period, German
  spelling differed much. For example, \"Thor\" and \"Tor\" were equal variants of
  spelling the word meaning \"gate\".\r\n\r\nSharp s was denoted by different writers
  differently (as \u017Fs or \u017Fz, which looked like \u017F\u0292). The graphical
  shape of the \xDF ligature developed independently in these two ways.\r\n\r\nThis
  dichotomy still shows itself in a small minority practice of uppercasing \xDF as
  \"SZ\" rather than \"SS\". Incidentally, this practice is understandable for most
  German readers (though not actively practiced), i.e. \"GROSZSTADT\" or \"MASZGEBLICH\"
  is understandable as the uppercasing of Gro\xDFstadt or ma\xDFgeblich.\r\n\r\nSee
  http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamt/490566363/ for an example. \r\n\r\nOne interesting
  issue is that in the <strong>1996 spelling reform</strong> the status of \xDF as
  a single letter has been finally confirmed. In the previous spelling, the general
  rule was that short vowels are denoted by following them by doubled consonant letters
  while long vowels are followed by single consonant letters. So writing \"met\" always
  indicates a long \"e:\" while \"mett\" indicates a short \"e\".\r\n\r\nIn case of
  \"s\"/\"\xDF\", it was confusing. Following a vowel with a single \"s\" always denoted
  a long vowel, following a vowel with a doubled \"ss\" indicated a short vowel, but
  following a vowel with \"\xDF\" did not give clue whether the vowel was short or
  long. So \"Ru\xDF\" was actually pronounced \"ru:s\" as if the \"\xDF\" stood for
  a single consonant letter, but \"Nu\xDF\" was pronounced \"nus\" as if the \"\xDF\"
  stood for a doubled consonant letter.\r\n\r\nThe 1996 spelling removed this uncertainty
  by changing the spelling of all \"\xDF\" into \"ss\" when the preceding vowel was
  to be pronounced short. Today\u2019s spelling of \"Nuss\" or \"dass\" underlines
  that the vowels are to be pronounced short.\r\n\r\nThe uppercasing of \"\xDF\" as
  \"SS\" but also as \"SZ\" defeats this clear rule. If I uppercase the word \"Ru\xDFpartikel\"
  into \"RUSSPARTIKEL\" or even \"RUSZPARTIKEL\", suddenly the natural way of pronouncing
  the \"U\" changes from short to long, so the reader is confused. The confusion is
  even bigger now, after the reform, because the special \"undefined\" treatment of
  \"\xDF\" no longer exists, so readers are used to \"\xDF\" being always treated
  as a single consonant letter, not as a ligature of a doubled consonant.\r\n\r\nTo
  remain logical, consistent and reader-friendly, \"\xDF\" needs (at some point) to
  assume a single graphemic shape in the uppercase.\r\n\r\nI strongly feel that uppercasing
  \"\xDF\" as \"SS\" is now -- especially under the new rules -- a <strong>temporary
  anachronism</strong>. \"\xDF\" is a single CHARACTER (as per orthographic perception).
  It has functionally liberated itself from its historical background (which was a
  ligature of \u017Fs or \u017Fz).\r\n\r\nToday, \"\xDF\" is no more a ligature of
  \"\u017Fs\" than \"\xE4\" is a ligature of \"ae\". The transition process from \"ae\"
  to \"\xE4\" has been completed about 200 years ago, and the transition process between
  \"\u017Fs\" to \"\xDF\" is happening now. Encoding the uppercase \"\xE4\" as \"A
  ZWJ <sups> E\" (or something like that) would make as little sense as encoding the
  uppercase \"\xDF\" as \"S ZWJ S\".\r\n\r\nI believe that \"SS\" is an anachronic,
  still-in-use but slowly-to-vanish poor man\u2019s solution to write the uppercase
  \"\xDF\".  I believe that it should be an exciting task for type designers now to
  come up with a new form. In my opinion, this issue is definitely not one that is
  completely solved. We\u2019re in the middle of a slow transition period for \"\xDF\".
  The 1996 reform started it and showed the direction.\r\n\r\n<strong>I myself once
  had the idea</strong> that Scedilla (U+015E, \u015E) would be most appropriate for
  denoting uppercase \xDF.\r\n\r\nAfter all, \u015E is historically an S with a subscribed
  z (that at this time looked like \u0292). Since \xDF is a ligature of either \u017Fs
  or of \u017F\u0292, uppercasing it as S\u0292, or, effectively, \u015E, would historically
  make sense.\r\n\r\nUsing this notation, \"Gau\xDF\" or \"Ro\xDFberg\" would be uppercased
  to \"GAU\u015E\" or \"RO\u015EBERG\".\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the umlaut in \"\xE4\" or
  \"\xF6\" is historically a superscripted \"e\", so historically \"\xE4\" and \"\xE6\"
  are two different ligations of \"ae\", and \"\xF6\" and \"\u0153\" are two different
  ligations of \"oe\".\r\n\r\nSince German readers are currently used to uppercasing
  \xDF as SS, i.e. they write \"GAUSS\" or \"ROSSBERG\", I even thought of a compromise:
  the SS remains doubled but for added distinctiveness, a subscribed z (i.e. a cedilla)
  is added after the first S. In other words, \"Gau\xDF\" or \"Ro\xDFberg\" should
  be uppercased as \"GAU\u015ES\" or \"RO\u015ESBERG\".\r\n\r\nHistorically, this
  would make sense. The cedilla would here have a similar function to the trema in
  Spanish or French: \"GAU\u015ES\" would make clear that it comes from \"Gau\xDF\"
  while \"GAUSS\" would make clear that it comes from \"Gauss\".\r\n\r\n\"RO\u015ESBERG\"
  does not look very awkward to a German reader. The addition of a diacritic does
  not dramatically change the reading pattern but still adds a distinctive mark that
  is, indeed, needed. If I were to design a glyph that should go into U+1E9E, it would
  probably look like \u015ES, or perhaps just SS, depending on the style of the typeface.\r\n\r\n<strong>An
  alternative approach</strong> is to look at the existing uppercase-to-lowercase
  relations within the Latin alphabet and try to derive a shape for the uppercase
  \xDF which maintains the same relations. \r\n\r\nIn most of the middle ages and
  the period up until the 19th century, the long s (\"\u017F\") and \"f\" were closely
  related, \"f\" being simply a \"\u017F\" with a stroke going through. The same,
  very primitive graphic relation exists between the prototypic shapes of the Greek
  letters gamma (\u0393) and digamma (\u03DC). Since the minuscule \"f\" always has
  been a \"\u017F\" with a middle stroke, then the capital \"F\" might also be considered
  an uppercase \"\u017F\" with a stroke going through. Of course an uppercase long
  s never existed, but this relation may be helpful when constructing the uppercase
  \xDF.\r\n\r\nBecause I think that *if* the Latin alphabet ever used or needed another
  capital S, the preferred shape could be that of a gamma (\u0393). This is a simple,
  effective shape that maintains a stylistic relation to the lowercase long s that
  is typical of other uppercase-to-lowercase relations.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the relations
  between Aa Ee Ff Mm Pp, we will notice that sharp, edgy connections in the uppercase
  are related to more smooth, round connections in the lowercase. If \"F\" developed
  into \"f\" in a cursive hand, then it is very easy to imagine that a cursive rendition
  of the \"\u0393\" shape might, indeed, look very much like \"\u017F\".\r\n\r\nThis
  is an important observation when thinking about the shape of an uppercase \"\xDF\":
  I assert that the shape of uppercase \"\xDF\" must be \"edgier\" than the lowercase.
  In short, I think that the left part of uppercase \xDF should be \"\u0393\".\r\n\r\nWhat
  about the right part? Here, I would call to exploit the double origin of \"\xDF\",
  which developed paralelly as a ligature of \"\u017Fs\" as well as of \"\u017Fz\"
  (where the \"z\" historically used the \"\u0292\" shape, so \"\u017F\u0292\").\r\n\r\nThese
  days, the lowercase \"\xDF\" is typically derived from the ligated form of \"\u017Fs\".
  For visual dissimilation purposes -- to strongly set apart the lowercase and the
  (new) uppercase \"\xDF\" I would derive the uppercase \"\xDF\" from a ligation of
  the hypothetical uppercase \"\u017F\" (i.e. \"\u0393\") and the shape of \"the other\"
  origin of \"\xDF\", i.e. of the historical \"Z\" shape.\r\n\r\n<strong>In short,
  I believe that the best graphical rendition of an uppercase \"\xDF\"</strong> would
  be be a well-designed ligature that incorporates these shapes: \"\u0393\u01B7\"\r\n\r\nI
  have made a small simulation using Garamond Premier (please excuse my poor drawing
  abilities):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/germandbls_garamond_5881.png]\r\nhttp://www.twardoch.com/tmp/germandbls_garamond.png\r\n\r\n<em>The
  first line shows what the historical origin of \xDF looks like, i.e. long s followed
  by a round s. The second line shows the current shape of \xDF as we know it. The
  third line shows what a hypothetical uppercase long S might look like (\"\u0393\"),
  which is just a mental exercise. The fourth line is my proposal for the uppercase
  \xDF shape.</em> \r\n\r\nAndreas St\xF6tzner has proposed an elaborate document
  that tries to explore all possible combinations of drawing an uppercase \xDF: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.signographie.de/cms/upload/pdf/Signa9_Kombinatorik_SZ_3.0.pdf\r\n\r\nMy
  proposal corresponds to the scheme A1-B2-C1, which I has the most \"uppercase\"
  appearance of all those presented there. \r\n\r\n<strong>On a related matter,</strong>
  at the exhibition \"Neue Baukunst. Berlin um 1800\", which is on display at the
  Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin until May 28, I have discovered a fantastic calligraphic
  lowercase \"\xDF\" shape, in which the \"long s\" part connects to the BOTTOM and
  not to the top of the following \"short s\". Please take a look:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/490547406_474a61e6b0_5721.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/adamt/490547406/\r\n\r\nThis
  got my imagination going.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"

      developed in a two-wise way: as a ligation of long s and round (\u201Cnormal\u201D)
      s, and as a ligation of long s and z.\xAB (A.Tw.)\r\n\r\nNO! No, no, no.\r\nWe
      need to distinguish the ORIGIN OF THE CHARACTER from the LETTERSHAPES.\r\nThis
      has been mixed up by everybody for far too long.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the \xDF
      *as a character* is: a long s with *some* curl or swash or stroke attached,
      in order to mark it being not an 'ordinary [long] s'. That attachment became
      randomly written like the ezh- (or 3-) shape by time (the same we find with
      other Latin letters for abbr., e.g. q). \r\nTherefor the letter became named
      \u201Ceszett\u201D, the common mind thus just describing what he sees, regardless
      of the fact that the letter (the character) was NOT derived from long-s and
      z functionally or phonetically or in the sense of a typographic ligature. Note
      that up today \u201CEszett\u201D is also named \u201CDreierles-Es\u201D or \u201CScharfes
      Es\u201D which indicates the very idea of \xDF as a character of its own.\r\nThe
      earliest sample of a \u201C\xDF\u201D in an upright roman-style printed German
      text (1667) is definitely no long-s_s nor a longs_z (ezh-shape). It\u2019s something
      else.\r\n\r\nThe \u201C\xDF is a s_s-ligature\u201D theory was induced by the
      italic long-s_s ligature later becoming (ab-)used to represent the German \xDF.
      Today the glyphs we use in Roman and Italic for \xDF are actually two different
      letters (or glyphs) by origin.\r\n\r\nA tricky history, admittedly.\r\n\r\nBut
      thanks Adam, for your elaborate explanations. Sorting out what the capital \xDF
      might look like this should be the level to work on it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, you\u2019ll
      find it notable that we (searching for Signa 9) actually testified two medieval
      examples for the capital long S, one of them Gamma-shaped.\r\n"

  body: "Mark, \r\n\r\nit is not like uppercase forms for fi or fl. The lack of \"uppercase
    \xDF\" means that it is uppercased to \"SS\", but \"ss\" is also uppercased to
    \"SS\". So \"SS\" is an ambiguous representation of two different lowercase combinations.
    This is particularly important in personal names: \"Peter Wei\xDF\" and \"Peter
    Weiss\" are two distinct names and one may not be substituted by the other. But
    in uppercase, it's only \"PETER WEISS\" which is ambiguous because it does not
    exactly tell you what name it actually stands for. \r\n\r\nIt is a bit like the
    French practice of removing accents over vowels when uppercasing. This practice
    was introduced when typewriters came into use simply because typewriters did not
    have separate uppercase accented letters. These days, it's a bad ambiguous anachronic
    practice which is no longer necessary but still practiced by many French people
    who are used to the typewriter customs and actually think you HAVE TO remove the
    accents when uppercasing. \r\n\r\nThis also reminds me of another practice, i.e.
    replacing long dashes by single or (perhaps) double hyphens. \r\n\r\nAs I have
    explained, the method of uppercasing \"\xDF\" as \"SS\" is in my eyes an anachronism.
    It is still the majority practice according to official German spelling rules,
    but I think this is largely a technological limitation. If well-designed uppercase
    \xDF exists in fonts, and there is a Unicode codepoint for it, *and* (at some
    point) it is mapped to the German keyboard layout in Windows and Mac OS X, some
    people will *happily* start using it. \r\n\r\n\"Popular use\" of \"\xDF\" in the
    middle of all-uppercase text suggests that there is an authentic need for that
    character. I believe we're still years ahead of widespread adoption, but I think
    type designers should do their best now to come up with appropriate forms, or
    at least once the character has been officially encoded. \r\n\r\nBesides, isn't
    it fun to invent a new letter? \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

    topic so far. There are very hot discussions in Germany about wether or not it
    makes sense to include this character.\r\n\r\nAs nice as it would be to *invent*
    a new character (i am convinced of your examples of the Gamma-S ligature), i find
    the S-cedilla followed by S solution very plausible.\r\n\r\nMy concern is: if
    the knowledge of the inclusion of an UC Germandbls into Unicode is spread everywhere
    i fear that some commission will determine what that character has to look like.
    The S-cedilla proposal is very easy and fast to determine as standard (and it
    would follow the convention to capitalize *\xDF* by *SS*). Also there would be
    no need to update fonts. This could be taken up into the orthography (and the

    come up in a disaster as it happened with the Euro (if some commission sets up

    will *never accept a S-cedilla in his name. \r\nAnd as to the Euro-sign: yes,
    the commission did a dreadful job, like commission tend to do. But today, since

  body: "I start with the caution that I was not involved in the implementation of
    the German spelling reform and that I am not an expert in this matter. However,
    having been a tutor at the German spelling reform publishing house DUDEN for nearly
    a quarter of a century, I occassionally had discussions with the editors of the
    spelling reform rule books.\r\n\r\nI am under the impression that both Mr. Twardoch
    and Mr. St\xF6tzner missed the crucial point concerning the s rules. The \"long/short\"-vowel
    rule as stated by Mr. Twardoch does not reflect the full rule, because the full
    rule distinguishes between surd (voiceless) and sonant (voiced) s sounds, i.e.
    the spelling depends on whether the s sound is surd or sonant.\r\n\r\nThe IPA
    chart was quoted by me in another context on my website\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/deutsch/ipa_sans.pdf\r\n\r\nOn
    page 2 of this PDF, in the top chart \"consonants\", row \"fricatives\", the surd
    s sounds are to the left and the sonant s sounds are to the right.\r\n\r\nIn the
    \"alveolar\" column, the surd s is \"s\" as IPA symbol, and the sonant s is \"z\"
    as IPA symbol.\r\n\r\nWhile some languages, e.g. Sanskrit, do not have sonant
    (voiced) s sounds, German (and also English) have both voiceless and voiced s
    sounds. Therefore, in such words as e.g. \"Ru\xDF\" and \"Nu\xDF\", we must examine
    two things:\r\n\r\nFirstly, is the preceding vowel sound short or long?\r\nSecondly,
    is the following s sound sonant or surd?\r\n\r\nMr. Twardoch considered the first
    question and omitted the second question. However the full rule states (I translate
    \"DUDEN\", 24th edition 2006, page 94):\r\n\r\n\"For the voiceless s sound after
    long vowel or diphthong, the spelling is \"\xDF\", provided that the s sound in
    all inflectional forms remains voiceless and no other consonant follows.\"\r\n\r\nSince
    proper names (see e.g. English \"Smith, Smyth\") often disregard spelling rules,
    the matter is highly tricky, and I doubt whether the Unicode committee ever examined
    what sound (voiceless, voiced) is to be defined by the proposed \"uppercase \xDF\",
    considering that neither Mr. Twardoch nor Mr. St\xF6tzner mention the tricky phonetical
    implications stated above.\r\n"

  body: "Adam, I echo Hrant's comment on quality of discussion. I found your writing
    lucid and really interesting. Thanks for the time you have taken on this. \r\n\r\n<em>These
    days, the lowercase \u201C\xDF\u201D is typically derived from the ligated form
    of \u201C\u017Fs\u201D. For visual dissimilation purposes \u2014 to strongly set
    apart the lowercase and the (new) uppercase \u201C\xDF\u201D I would derive the
    uppercase \u201C\xDF\u201D from a ligation of the hypothetical uppercase \u201C\u017F\u201D
    (i.e. \u201C\u0393\u201D) and the shape of \u201Cthe other\u201D origin of \u201C\xDF\u201D,
    i.e. of the historical \u201CZ\u201D shape.\r\n\r\nIn short, I believe that the
    best graphical rendition of an uppercase \u201C\xDF\u201D would be be a well-designed
    ligature that incorporates these shapes: \u201C\u0393\u01B7\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nYes
    but if I want my C and c to look similar, and my S and s, and my O and o, etc
    why would I want my U/c \xDF to be different in design derivation from its lower
    case counterpart? i.e. if you're going to use s for derivation of \xDF then shouldn't
    you be using S for derivation of u/c \xDF? Is visual dissimilation (between upper
    and lower cases at least) necessary in a font? (It probably depends what the font's
    going to be used for which is a whole different discussion.)\r\n\r\nAndreas: your
    pdf is excellent. It appeals to me that there are people that are willing to do
    lots of very hard work and then generously share the results with all for free.\r\n\r\nMy
    personal view is that the \u0393 approach makes it look like an uppercase character
    (whatever that looks like - it's very subjective) more so than the long s/inverted
    U approach. That is not to say that I'll use the \u0393 approach if it doesn't
    suit the rest of the font. The u/c \xDF is certainly not going to be a fundamental
    character which shapes the rest of the font. \r\n\r\nBut nobody's seriously going
    to tell me <em>which actual design</em> to use in my own font? Are they?\r\n\r\nYou've
    surely got to do what suits the font best and, as with all fonts, there are going
    to be some u/c \xDF's which are totally different from others because there are
    fonts which themselves are totally different. This reflects the diversity of man
    and the wisdom of his Creator.\r\n\r\nI don't pretend to know anything about the
    history of type, derivation of characters especially German ones, German pronunciation
    and the like. Nevertheless, a bigger principle is at stake:\r\n\r\nIndividual
    'interpretation' of character forms is surely one of the things that makes a font
    great. That's probably why some of us were so hacked off by being told what the
    euro symbol should look like - in every font! The thought that a designer must,
    in any measure, <em>comply</em> is abhorrent to me. \r\n\r\nProvided my font can
    be 'read' (whatever that word means - one person reads very differently from the
    next), then it can look like anything I please, can't it? \r\n\r\nI guess the
    real art is designing a font that can be read well by as many different types
    of reader. And unfortunately, when it comes to the real art is designing a font,
    I'm well out of my depth."

    derivation from its lower case counterpart? \r\n\r\nThe handwriting practice for
    \xDF by contemporary writers allows both \"IS\" and \"I3\" structures. The S shape
    is more flowy, cursive, written in nature than the 3 shape, which is more constructed,
    drawn. The uppercase-vs-lowercase contrast is exactly about that: drawn vs. written.
    Pretty much all of Latin uppercase has very simple, basic forms stitched together,
    which are easy to construct and draw. \"S\" is the by far most complex form within
    the basic scheme. \r\n\r\nCombining a complex \"long s\" skeleton with an equally
    complex \"S\" skeleton is an overkill for a letter. It starts looking like a horribly
    complex character such as \"&\", which practically no-one can write properly.
    \r\n\r\nI assert that letters must be simple. Uppercase letters must be simpler
    in skeleton than lowercase, because that is their very nature. Also, uppercase
    forms should be solid, strong, monumental in character. \r\n\r\nI believe that
    the \"monumental skeleton\" of uppercase \xDF I propose: \r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/germandbls_garamond2_5760.png\r\n\r\nfulfils
    the criteria better than the \"Dresdner skeleton\" that Andreas Seidel and Andreas
    St\xF6tzner prefer: \r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/sz_birth_6221.gif\r\n\r\nThe
    Dresdner form lacks something sturdy, defined, at their top-left. It simply looks
    like it is half-way between uppercase and lowercase.  \r\n\r\n> Is visual dissimilation
    (between upper and \r\n> lower cases at least) necessary in a font? \r\n\r\nOf
    course, within a reasonable range. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nPs. Edit: I meant \"Dresdner
    form\", not \"Leipziger form\", i.e. I meant the form that Andreas St\xF6tzner
    included in his DIN/ISO/Unicode proposal (first link in my first posting). "

    I was doing corporate design work in Washington, DC, we had to disguise a lot
    of the companies who we researched. So instead of publishing a report on Acme,
    Inc., we called them Beta Corporation, or something like that. Readers of our
    reports knew who we were talking about, but we didn't name names without permission.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    the authors I worked with always thought that it would be clever for the first
    letter of Beta Corporation's name to be an actual beta, rather than a b. But their
    fonts did not have betas in them, or they didn't know how to input a beta. So
    they just write \xDF (\xDFeta Corporation). Most of them thought that the \xDF
    actually was a beta anyway. Good luck trying to educate them to see around that

    continuity and the reality of intercultural pentration via loan words etc.\r\n\r\nAnd
    in fact one great way to give consideration to a form might be to try to write
    it out in the various blackletter styles: Textura, Bastarda, Schwabacher, Fraktur,
    Burgundica, etc, to see what happens. BTW, I am also not suggesting that direct
    continuity of form from the Sans serif to the Blackletter would be desirable either.
    Looking at Fette Fraktur's C,L, and S certainly suggest the opposite might be
    true.\r\n\r\nWhen I think about this letter it seems like the top 3 purposes would

  body: "At Hrant's request, here's the text of a message regarding the uppercase
    eszett that I sent to the ATypI discussion list. I should note that I originally
    opposed the encoding of the new character in Unicode, arguing that it could be
    implemented as a ligature of SS, with a plain text distinction made using the
    Combing Grapheme Joiner control character. I still think that good arguments can
    be made in favour of such an encoding -- for instance, it enables documents to
    be backwards compatible with older fonts that do not support the uppercase eszett
    glyph --, but on the whole I've accepted Andreas St\xF6tzner and, especially,
    Asmus Freytag's reasoning in favour of the proposed encoding.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Hrant
    thought the following was a good synopsis of the matter, offered here as a contribution
    to the understanding of how we came to be where we are: wondering what this thing
    should look like.\r\n\r\n<em>A few comments about the proposed uppercase eszett
    character:\r\n\r\nThis has been proposed to ISO 10646 (and hence Unicode) by DIN,
    so the likelihood of it being accepted for encoding is very high. Since it is
    a German character, with no implications for other languages, no one feels particularly
    inclined to vote against a DIN proposal. If the Germans determine that they want
    this character, they can have it.\r\n\r\nSo why do they want it? Basically, they
    want it because at least some people are using it and it is considered better
    to have an unambiguous encoding distinct from SS. The uppercase eszett is not
    a new invention: it has been around for at least a hundred years. It has been
    used on-and-off by some publishers -- notably on the cover of the DDR edition
    of Duden -- and although it has never been enshrined in the official norms of
    German orthography it persists. As Asmus Freytag wrote on the Unicode discussion
    list: it is remarkable that something without official sanction should have persisted
    so long in such a rule-bound culture.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that at
    least some of the users of the uppercase eszett have employed it in the interests
    of alphabet reform, i.e. they want to see it become standard. Others may have
    used it only as a display solution for a particular piece of typography. For whatever
    reasons, some Germans have found a use or a need for it, in preference to SS.\r\n\r\nAnd
    let's be clear that the casing rule \xDF = SS is really messy for a nominally
    bicameral alphabet. Although \xDF began life as a ligature, it has long since
    ceased to function as one: it has distinct semantics from the sequence of two
    letters that it used to represent. It is a distinct character. The idea that it
    can be a distinct character in lowercase but not in uppercase is perverse, and
    causes major headaches in German text processing. The simple fact that case conversions
    in German are not roundtripable without dictionary support is crazy. Even if it
    were decided that the uppercase form of \xDF should always </em>look<em> like
    SS, a good argument could be made for encoding this as a distinct uppercase character.
    However...\r\n\r\n...that's not how German is encoded, and the DIN proposal for
    uppercase \xDF is explicit that the new character should not interfere with existing
    standards for German text. So this means that \xDF still = SS, and the Unicode
    casing rules for German remain in place. The new uppercase \xDF character will
    exist alongside these rules. What this means is that any software performing case
    mapping between the new uppercase \xDF and the lowercase \xDF characters must
    do so at a level independent of the Unicode character properties. This is quite
    possible, and if the uppercase \xDF character starts to become widely used I think
    we can expect to see it handled in such ways.\r\n\r\nThe uppercase \xDF encoding
    is an interesting instance of a character being made available outside of the
    norms of encoding for the language in which it might be used. This might sound
    silly, but it allows this persistent heterographic letter to function in modern
    text encoding and display environments, and in so doing puts a lot of control
    in the hands of users to determine its future. It may fall by the wayside -- one
    more little used Unicode codepoint -- or it may, in time, become formally recognised
    and made part of the standard orthography.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, it may seem
    contrary that, on the one hand, the Germans have regularised and simplified the
    use of \xDF -- suggesting, at least to Bruno, that it is on the way out --, but
    on the other hand providing at least some recognition for an uppercase \xDF. But
    it is easy to see how these may be complementary moves: providing a distinct uppercase
    equivalent to a lowercase character regularises an anomaly in a bicameral alphabet
    and simplifies case conversion.</em>"

    Lozos, as I understand the <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/#Tailored_Casing_Operations\"
    target=\"_blank\">unicode.org information</a>, the uppercase eszett is there now
    but its existence does not change casing rules -- eszett becomes SS in all caps
    setting. Uppercase eszett is meant for 'special cases'.* Following this, it would
    be a mistake if features would switch from lowercase to uppercase or smallcap
    eszett.\r\nThe only thing you might do is\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub whatever_this_letters_postscript_name_is

    users require the sharp s to be preserved in uppercase.</cite> Overall, such usage
    is rare. In contrast, standard German orthography uses the string \"SS\" as uppercase
    mapping for small sharp s. Thus, with the default Unicode casing operations, capital
    sharp s will lowercase to small sharp s, but not the reverse: small sharp s uppercases
    to \"SS\". <cite>In those instances where the reverse casing operation is needed,</cite>
    a tailored operation would be required.\r\n[non-italics are mine]\r\n"

    design decisions are based on the following thoughts:\r\n\r\n- I think the cap
    \xDF should take its cues from the lowercase \xDF as much as possible -- they
    should look like they are related stylistically, since they are part of the same
    typeface, and people are already familiar with the lowercase form.\r\n\r\n- I
    don't think the ligated (Tschichold) form can be translated to an uppercase form,
    as much as I like it in the lowercase form. It's too complex and relies on the
    space above the s, which caps don't have. This leaves the \"B\" form. \r\n\r\n-
    However, I tried to get a hint of the ligated form in the Garamond example.\r\n\r\n-
    In the lowercase it helps that the \xDF doesn't look like any other lowercase
    letters. But, as a capital, I don't think the \"B\"-ness of the \xDF can be avoided
    by introducing novel forms to its construction. My solution, to help distinguish
    the cap \xDF from the cap B, is to open up the interior space and make it a bit
    wider\r\n\r\n- The tail on the bottom right takes a form similar to the lowercase
    form, but in scale with the other capitals. The terminal on the cap J usually
    works.\r\n\r\n- I used a corner shape in the upper left because it makes it look
    more like a cap and to help distinguish it from the beta.\r\n\r\n- Some of the
    other proposed designs I think look too busy, novel or exotic, calling attention
    to themselves and failing to harmonize well with the other letters. I also think
    a lot of them work for some faces better than others. I hope to overcome this
    by sticking with elements of letters and forms that are already present in the
    typeface and keeping the general form simple and straightforward.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    was afraid you'd say that. :-)\r\n\r\nDepending on the font (Georgia's not bad,
    because of the old style figures), many of these are hard to distinguish without
    context: Il1, O0o, rnm, 5S, 2Zz. In some cases, the only differences are a little
    hook or serif or corner instead of a curve or a slight gap or difference in height
    or width.\r\n\r\nContext helps a lot. Even the current \xDF, if used in place
    of a B, reads as a B.\r\n\r\nIt's problematic to introduce a new form to the alphabet.
    Reading depends on familiarity of forms. If a novel form is introduced, it's natural
    to try to interpret it as a letter we already know. (A lot of logos use this to
    great effect.) In cases where there are two words, such as gro\xDFe and grobe,
    it may take more time to get used to, but I suspect that this is an edge case
    and unusual, and that most words that contain \xDF do not have such an evil twin
    and would be interpreted correctly due to context, given time to become familiar
    with the new form (even mine).\r\n\r\nIn any case, as someone who doesn't read
    German natively, I do feel at a disadvantage with this problem. I'm just trying
    to apply what I know to the problem and making some observations. Part of my motivation
    for speaking up is selfish: Some of the proposed designs look very awkward to

    It's a much rarer word than \"opposite\", so in Avant Garde for example you will

    trouble is, many upper case glyphs look like their lowercase counterparts but
    many don't - it's about half and half depending on which font you're talking about.
    Now, who is to say whether the upper case long s is one of the characters that
    looks like its lowercase counterpart or not; e.g. it might actually look like
    an F/gamma or even a crazy J, who is to say?\r\n\r\nBut, surely anyone can decide
    what an uppercase long s looks like and may the best man/woman 'win'. Aren't you
    (and Nick S) saying that the uppercase long s looks like half an inverted U and
    not a F/gamma? Why is that anymore right than the F/gamma approach?\r\n\r\nI'd
    love to say that historically the long s had nothing to do with f but it kinda
    did, didn't it? You can't really fault anyone for going for the uppercase F as
    a model for the uppercase long s too.\r\n\r\nAre you saying, first and foremost,
    that we need to have some consensus on what an uppercase long s looks like? If
    so, you are bound to get some that think that because what you're talking about
    doesn't really exist, then this new glyph should actually look like two regular
    uppercase S's ligatured. Then the next logical question is, \"Did they actually
    need ligaturing?\" I'm not sure they do, just like FI and FFL etc don't really
    warrant special characters.\r\n\r\nAll I want is for the logic to be good. Rightly
    or wrongly, having good, robust logic bothers me more than whether the character
    looks nice. Not many posters on this thread seem to share my concerns logically.
    Anyone (OK, not anyone) can design a lovely a character, a lot of the proposed
    Long s's in this thread look great, but don't they amount to nothing more than
    follies if the logic that conceived them was flawed?\r\n\r\nQuestion 1 for me
    is \"So what does an uppercase long s (if it actually ought to be made to live
    and breathe at all) really look like?\" If one answers this then one might be
    on the way to defining the look of the actual ligature in its entirety. If you
    can't answer this question, maybe don't force a ligature to exist.\r\n"

    I cannot help considering the uppercase Eszett as a bastard. The lowercase version
    already contains a letterforms that by itself does not exist any more (long-s),
    and any uppercase version needs to come up with an uppercase long-s which never
    existed and which must be unintelligent by design. The only solution is, more
    or less, to uppercasify the lowercase version. But this solution actually means
    violating the typographic rule to not use an eszett in all-caps setting, but hiding
    this a bit by dressing up what structurally is a lowercase letter so it <em>looks</em>
    more like an uppercase. \"Uppercase Eszett\" itself is logically not sound."

    The very fact that Szabolcs has said, \"pretty much not identifyable as a capital
    version of \xDF\" implies that he has an actual identifyable capital \xDF in mind
    (granted, it maybe only be a capitalised lowercase \xDF) with which to measure
    the 'not' against. If something is not <em>x</em>, it implies the existence of
    a positive, very real <em>x</em>, otherwise the statement is a nonsense. Now,
    I'm certainly <u>not</u> implying Szabolcs's statement is nonsense. All I'm trying
    to find out is what his identifyable capital \xDF looks like. If his answer is
    \"more like a lowercase \xDF\" then I think maybe a little more conservatism may
    be needed, for a good while at least, because this character is unavoidably bound/doomed
    to look like its lowercase counterpart.\r\n\r\n>We are working in the dark until

    alone. But some seem determined to switch the lights off and work in the dark.
    I think it was Frank Pick (London Transport) who said, \"Good design is intelligence
    made visible.\" Is it in any way intelligent to try and invent a new character
    and expect it to be in any way legible from the outset?\r\n\r\nHas anyone done
    a comprehensive analysis of what exists in German print/writing? Is there somewhere
    we can go to see what's out there? Next, are the existing versions of the glyph
    what people are measuring recognition/legibility/readability by? If not, then
    I would ask how are they measuring?* Again, a measure of anything necessarily
    requires an absolute against which to measure.\r\n\r\n*My fear again is that the
    plumbline is the lowercase \xDF which again dooms this character to looking like
    its lowercase ancestor in its various guises (leipziger/dresdner/whatever). OK
    it's 'safe', but it's also bound to be very legible/readable. Nice try, anyone
    who's going for anything different - but it'll never actually <em>work</em>."

    as well as a certain monumentalism) that pull it away from lc <em>set</em>.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    any words in ANY languages that begin with \u201Css\u201D? Would these languages
    benefit from a spelling reform to replace that digraph with eszett (and by extension
    Eszett)?</cite>\r\n\r\nYou might have heard of Korean automobile manufacturer
    Ssangyong Motors. Korean distinguishes between two versions of <em>s</em>: a normal
    <em>s</em> and a \u2018tense\u2019 <em>s</em>. The <em>s</em> sounds in most other
    languages, including English, are actually closer to the Korean \u2018tense\u2019
    <em>s</em>.\r\n\r\nIn hangul (the Korean alphabet), the former is written \u3145
    and the latter written \u3146, which comes from doubling the symbol for the normal
    <em>s</em>. The same logic is applied to form the symbols for all the tense consonants:
    \u3132 from \u3131, \u3138 from \u3137, \u3143 from \u3142, \u3149 from \u3148.
    Most romanization schemes represent \u3145 as <em>s</em> and \u3146 as <em>ss</em>
    in analogy with the consonant doubling in hangul. Because \u3146 can come in the
    beginning of a word in Korean, you can see romanized spellings that begin with
    <em>Ss</em> as in Ssangyong.\r\n\r\nYou also see romanized spellings that begin
    with <em>Kk</em>, <em>Pp</em>, and <em>Tt</em>, and in some romanization schemes,
    <em>Jj</em>. Other doubled letters such as <em>ll</em>, <em>mm</em>, and <em>nn</em>
    are found only in the middle of words. There is no reason to single out the digraph
    <em>ss</em> to be replaced with a symbol like the eszett.\r\n\r\nAccording to
    Wikipedia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Lithuanian#Personal_names\">Prussian
    Lithuanians</a> seem to have used <em>\xDF</em> to represent the sound written
    <em>\u0161</em> in standard modern Lithuanian orthography. For example, they wrote
    Balt\xDFus for Bal\u010Dius (<em>t\xDF</em> represents the sound <em>\u010D</em>
    = <em>t\u0161</em>). However, the Prussian Lithuanian name corresponding to Lithuanian
    \u0160ameitatis/\u0160ameitaitis is Szameitat, so it seems they avoided <em>\xDF</em>
    word-initially and replaced it with <em>sz</em>. The Prussian Lithuanian community
    disappeared after World War II, though."

    We are only familiar with the lc shape, so that's what we recognize as an Eszett,
    even if it is placed within uc text.\r\nFor obvious typographic reasons we need
    a corresponding uc shape, instead of just using the lowercase Eszett in uppercase
    text. So we need to capitalize the lowercase shape. But if we do that, we end
    up with a character that looks like a B, so we can't use that either. What we
    need is a compromise. A shape that is close enough to the lowercase Eszett and
    far enough from the B. \r\nI think it is already pretty obvious where we are heading
    with that:\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/eszettmix_6267.png]\r\n\r\nA
    lot of designers seem to believe that such a compromise could never be a \"real\"
    capital letter, but I don't think this is true. It may look weird if your not
    used to it, but once it will be heavily used in Germany and Austria, it will just
    blend in with all the other characters. (We also just had spelling reformation
    with the same discussions about the old and new, what looks weird or \"right\".
    Now, just after a couple of years, the (younger) people have already adapted the
    new rules, as if they were always there. It wont be any different with the capital
    Eszett.)\r\n\r\nFurthermore I expect the capital Eszett to evolve further over
    the next decades. Once it will be in common use its shape may evolve away from
    the original compromise. But this needs to happen slowly. We cannot use the \"2058
    shape\" today, even if we would know how it would look like. People wouldn't be
    able to read it and therefore not accept it. Like they would probably consider
    a car of the year 2058 an ugly bastard, without having seen the evolution that
    led to its design. "

    whole point of having a sharp S: so it doesn't look like a double consonant.\r\n\r\nIn
    German, like in most languages, double consonants make the preceding vowel short,

    this principle is quite clear now.\r\n\r\nSo, if we see the need for a sharp S
    then that's because words like \"GROSSES\" somehow \"look wrong\" (even though
    ortho-typographically correct). If the words with the new sharp S still look like
    \"GROSSES\" because the sharp S looks like SS then there's not much gained and

    Altaira is also right: see historical precedents, if the form has  in some cases
    been written in \"more uppercase\" form (there is no fixed distinction about the
    two, save the one matured in typographic tradition).\r\n\r\n<cite> A great specific
    example here is the ampersand. It comes from \u201Ce\u201D + \u201Ct\u201D. Whoop-di-doo.
    When you take that too seriously you end up with a form that causes reading problems
    for many people*, like in Poppl Laudatio (which I otherwise adore). A well-designed
    ampersand is based on what people need; what it used to be is just fodder for
    pedantic discussion. </cite>\r\n@Hrant: Downright pretentious, because the \"and-per-se-and\"
    is, and actually remains an \"et\".\r\nI would have had problems to understand
    its being an [e] just *before* someone told me it was an \"et\", which \u2013
    as an Italian \u2013 comes as a perfect logical succession, or better as the same
    thing.\r\nIt has happened some people asked me to change Rotis' \"Et\" into a
    more common [&] form, but that's because people in Italy still think of the [&]
    solely as a \"commercial e\" (in Italian it's called \"e commerciale\"), and they
    do not know it's an \"et\", out of ignorance.\r\n\r\nRead both these entries:\r\nhttp://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand
    (Italian)\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#Usage (English-International)\r\n\r\nAs
    much as Wikipedia is nonsense, these entries show how the evolution happens by
    a combination of planning and usage, despite all the thinking it may be done before.\r\nThe
    world may have become \"anglocentric\" (in terms of shared tongue), but \u2013
    as you see \u2013 this happens out of necessity, otherwise we wouldn't be allowed
    to be here to talk together in a shared experience\u2026\r\n\r\nNow, my big question
    (since it is still not clear to me): is the [\xDF] a simple double s? Of course
    not, since it's a \"sharp\" z-sound. So, why people keep using it as a substitute
    for \"ss\"?\r\nBesides, how an \"ss\" ligature should be drawn?\r\nAnd [AE] or
    [OE]? They are not ligatures, they address sounds, right?"

    following the advice from Ralf (thanks, Ralf). I know which the shapes are not
    good yet, but, the overall shape is running to the Ralph/Nick Shinn concept, what
    you think?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PenabicoGermandblsUppercase_4529.png]

    and Geodesy (\u201CBundesamt fu\u0308r Kartographie und Geoda\u0308sie\u201D)
    published the 5th revised edition of the document <a href=\"http://www.stagn.de/Portals/0/101125_TopR5.pdf\">\u201CToponymic
    guidelines for map and other editors for international use Federal Republic of
    Germany\u201D</a>. \r\n\r\nSection 1.1.3 of this document says: \r\n\r\n<blockquote><cite>1.1.3
    Special letter \u1E9E \xDF\r\nThe special letter \xDF (\u201Cstrong s\u201D) existed
    hitherto only as small letter (minuscule). In 2007 DIN and ISO accepted the capital
    letter \u1E9E which is rendered on position 1E9E of the Unicode character tables.
    In official spelling it must not be substituted by any other letter combination,
    as e.g. SS, ss. In the alphabetical order \u1E9E, \xDF is treated like SS, ss.
    Since a typographical implementation of the upper case letter \u1E9E in the various
    character fonts will take some time, it may be temporarily substituted by SS,
    ss.\r\nNEW: Due to the new regulation of German spelling the letter \xDF is after
    a short (stressed) vowel now replaced by ss. The letter \xDF remains after a long
    vowel or a diphthong.</cite></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><cite>Examples for
    names of geographical regions:\r\n\u2014 now: Hassberge (short and stressed vowel
    a), until now: Ha\xDFberge\r\n\u2014 will continue: Mei\xDFner (diphthong preceding
    \xDF), MEI\u1E9ENER\r\n\u2014 will continue: Gro\xDFer Feldberg (long vowel o
    preceding \xDF), GRO\u1E9EER FELDBERG</cite></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><cite>Example
    for an officially approved name of a municipality\r\n\u2014 will continue: Ha\xDFfurt,
    HA\u1E9EFURT (though a short and stressed vowel a is preceding \xDF)</cite></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis
    is, to my knowledge, the first official <strong>German government body</strong>
    that not only approves but actually <strong>prescribes</strong> the use of uppercase
    \xDF (U+1E9E, \u1E9E), and only accepts the use of SS \u201Ctemporarily\u201D
    (\u201Csince a typographical implementation of the upper case letter \u1E9E in
    the various character fonts will take some time\u201D). \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    names, Sta\u0308ndiger Ausschuss fu\u0308r geographische Namen (StAGN), at the
    Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy) is concerned with uniquely identifable
    names, so there are no ambiguities. For example, the name of the town I used to
    live in is officially \"Frankfurt (Oder)\". In the past, there were various spellings
    (\"Frankfurt (Oder)\", \"Frankfurt/Oder\", \"Frankfurt-an-der-Oder\", \"Frankfurt
    a.d. Oder\" etc.), but it seems that the Germans like to have everything normalized,
    so, well, they also decided to normalize the geographical names. \r\n\r\nWhich
    I think makes sense. After all, these days geographical names need to be stored
    in databases, processed digitally etc., so it's useful to have *one official*
    spelling of a geographical name. \r\n\r\nA."

    a lowercase only connection to a full letter of the alphabet. (\xDF is just a
    little bit behind, because in blackletter there was no need for it, because blackletter
    wasn't set in uppercase.)\r\n\r\nHere is a book from 1774. The e had moved on
    top of a, o, and u:\r\n<img src=\"http://www.typografie.info/temp/umlaute2.jpg\">\r\nBut

    way for some time, but the uppercase umlauts still emerged, because like Adam

    no, they are! I come from a town called <strong>P\xF6\xDFneck</strong> and we
    have a battle for decades how it should be pronounced and how it should be written
    in uppercase texts. It literally splits a whole town.\r\n\r\n<cite>Of course it
    does. Herr ROSSBERG (i.e. Rossberg) is pronounced \u201Crosberg\u201D ... while
    Herr RO\xDFBERG (i.e. Ro\xDFberg) is pronounced \u201Cro:sberg\u201D </cite>\r\n\r\nNo,
    the reform of 1996 doesn't apply to names. On my businesscard is says \xBBRo\xDFbach
    and Herrmann GbR\xAB and it is still (and will always be) pronounced \xBBRossbach\xAB.
    \r\n\r\n<strong>In our business</strong> the correct spelling of names is the
    biggest concern in the capital sharp s debate. Just think of all the bibliographies
    in books. We usually like to set names in small caps, but names have to keep their
    Eszett, because <strong>Wei\xDF</strong> and <strong>Weiss</strong> are different
    names. \r\n\r\n<strong>For the public</strong> this is a solution for a problem
    that most of the people aren't even aware of. Again: Herr Ro\xDFbach from P\xF6\xDFneck
    will always write RO\xDFBACH and P\xD6\xDFNECK to keep the proper names. So now
    we offer him a way to do it with letters that are typographically correct. \r\n\r\nAbout
    the shape:\r\nI don't think we should define the one and only way of designing
    the capital sharp s. There are different solutions and over time one will eventually

    like fi and fl, it belongs to ligatures like w, which (might have evolved from
    a ligature but) are a an official letter of the alphabet with a distinct phonetic
