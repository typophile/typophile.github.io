  body: "I think it's got too much of round corners to be univers. \r\n\r\nJust realized
    that it is also the logo of [[http://www.merck.de|Merck global]].\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MERCK_5314.jpg]"

  body: "Can't be ruled out for that reason; in logos you typically customize letters
    quite a bit. But the K is all wrong, so it can't be univers after all. \r\n\r\nBtw
