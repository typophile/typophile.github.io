body: At [[http://fontmarketplace.com/|FontMarketPlace]], a new web storefront of
  Ascender Corporation, there are lots of fonts which say that the names are copyright
  Monotype, but they are priced at a fraction of the price they are on the Monotype
  storefront, Fonts.com. Why would Monotype compete with itself in this way? Can anybody
  explain what is going on here?

    think it's just a different market segment: the fonts are all offered with a single
    user EULA*, in TrueType only, and most (but not all) don't include the small caps
    and osfs. \r\n\r\nThere are also some fonts that I suspect were never big sellers
    for Montotype, like <a href=\"http://fontmarketplace.com/productinfo.aspx?ProductID=PAS01-70-01-01&CategoryID=41\">
    Pastonchi.</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that clause 10 of the <a href=\"http://fontmarketplace.com/custom.aspx?ID=18\">EULA</a>
    offers _editable_ embedding if used \"in a \"Personal or Internal Business Use\"
    document (that is, a document other than a \"Commercial Product\" as defined herein)\"."

    \"an electronic document or data file\" offered for \"for a separate fee\", so
    you needn't worry about about the flyer or the print magazine.\r\n\r\nI interpret
    the EULA to mean that I can't embed the font in a ebook I intend to sell, but
    I can embed it in a informational PDF that I put on my web site and allow the

  body: "I gather that the goal here is to segment the market and expand one part
    of it for quality fonts. Fonts intended for publishing would be left to the full
    open type version of a font with multiple weights and styles. And these more restricted
    sets would be sold to those not involved in professional design and publication.
    \r\n\r\nWhat is not clear to me is whether this will just expand the market for
    fonts, or will undercut the profits for the full versions--or actually enhance
    them by fostering appreciation of quality fonts? To what extent do the two markets
    overlap, and in what way? I guess we will find out. "

    Product usually means something like a piece of software, a web book, or magazine
    distributed via pdf. That is created as a product for sale. Use of a font in tis
    realm would require a different license. Actually most EULAs contain this sort
    of language or something similar. (standard caveat, I am not a lawyer)\r\n\r\nTo

  body: "Florian wrote: \"But when I do the same job as a hired (contract) designer,
    I would need another, regular license?\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to FontMarketplace,
    the answer is no. The EULA language \"personal and internal business use\" describes
    how the font can be used (installed on personal computers, and not on web servers).\r\n\r\nThere
    is nothing to stop creative professionals from using the site, and if they increase
    the workstation license quantity to 5 then the price comes is similar to what
    they are paying today on our AscenderFonts.com site and many other creative professional
    font websites.\r\n\r\nAs others have described above, and as we have stated in
    our press release, our intent is to appeal to Microsoft Word users (and all the
    other software applications used at the home and office) by presenting fonts in
    a consumer-friendly manner, around themes and occasions, and to make them affordable
    with a single user license. Our believe is that there is a chasm between free
    font websites and creative professional font websites, and that's where FontMarketplace
    is focused. \r\n\r\nAnd if we can entice people to move from Comic Sans to one
    of the many other FontMarketplace fonts, then I think many of you will believe
    that we've done our part to make the world a more beautiful place :)\r\n\r\n(note:
    of course we offer Comic Sans on the site for those who misplaced it and can't
    live without it!)"

  body: "Here's the deal:\r\n\r\nThe license to the Font Marketplace fonts are almost
    identical to Ascender- the difference is the amount of machines the software can
    be installed on; in this case, one user.\r\n\r\nYou can use the fonts for \"for-profit\"
    graphic designs just like \"any other font\". The commercial license only applies
    to the digital software embedded in a product for sale.\r\n\r\nAlso if the PDFs
    you designed that are edited by a client/associate/ Ascender/FontMarketplace would
    like that user to purchase his or her own license (which happens to be very affordable).\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I think Ascender has done a fabulous job of bringing low cost quality fonts to
    all users. The Ascender Originals are particularly excellent.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz
