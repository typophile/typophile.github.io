  body: When I lived in England I tried the Aero bar. I have to say that the texture
    didn't agree with my teeth. However, I do wish we had Galaxy dark here in the
    States.

  body: when i was in Russia i fell in love with Nestle Picnic bars. The closest thing
    we have here are the Cadbury Fruit & Nut bars, but not quite the same thing.

  body: I love nuts with my chocolate, but not fruit. I accidentally bought a fruit
    & nut once and was very sad, when I finally went to eat it, to find fruit in my
    nuts. :^P
