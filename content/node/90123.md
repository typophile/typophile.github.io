  body: Don't know the face but I suspect the /M/s might be upside-down /W/s, if that
    helps.

  body: "Thank you for your replies. \r\nThe W's do look like upside M's.\r\nI think
    your observation is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAQ - Thank you for your link. Although
    I do not think that Publication JNL is the correct typeface.\r\n\r\nCould you
    please elaborate?\r\n\r\nPlus: Any other suggestions please?\r\nThank you."

  body: It is indeed similar to De Vinne/Romana - perhaps a custom cut De Vinne for
    MIT?
