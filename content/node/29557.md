body: "I used to upload some specimens of the MATD students on http://www.rdg.ac.uk/~lts98gl
  , but as the formats of submitted work evolved this was not enough. There is an
  interim wiki setup for the at least half of the 2006\u201307 year on http://wiki.typefacedesign.org
  where some material is slowly being migrated. \r\nFor now, the items most of interest
  for Typophiles are the pages of recent graduates; on each there is the usual specimen
  for their typeface, and a document that so far was not public: we call it Reflection
  on Practice, and is a longer narrative on each project. They make for interesting
  reading. \r\nI cannot promise how long this resource will be up in this form, but
  it may prove interesting in the meanwhile.\r\n"

  body: Some truly outstanding work here, Gerry. This next generation of type designers
    are gonna give the current crop a run for their money. Can't wait until they're
    available for use!

  body: Thank you for making available the Reflection on Practice documents. There
    is enough reading material here to keep me occupied several weeks, I suspect.
    There is some truly insightful work, especially concerning the development of
    multi-script faces, and I'm sure other type designers and I will find it a valuable
    resource.

  body: Indeed, the RoP documents begin to give a glimpse into the kind of work students
    put into their projects. (The bulk of the work is still "hidden" in a substantial
    workfile, which it is not possible to make available online.) Too much in the
    process of typeface design is internalised, in my view. How new designers experience
    the learning process, how they define a design space, identify decision points
    and the range of possibilities at each, how they scope solutions and validate
    results, how they test decisions reflectively down the line, how they build "memory"
    in a systematic process, all these things are worthy of being discussed outside
    and beyond each specific project. The RoPs begin to do that, although I'm sure
    the specs will change every year (...).
