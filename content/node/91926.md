  body: "eBooks (at least for now) have a lower resolution than paper, but offer the
    ability to introduce new interactive elements. \r\n\r\nIn terms of graphic design,
    I'm not sure there's a huge difference, though. It's still a book in concept--be
    it on paper or screen. You may want to look into some of the 'interactive' books
    being created that include music and animation and the like, though I question
    if those are still really 'ebooks'. \r\n\r\nI think an analogy may be TV. Is the
    internet forever changing television? Of course it is. That said, a TV show is
    still a TV show, regardless if you watch it on your actual TV or your iPad. "
