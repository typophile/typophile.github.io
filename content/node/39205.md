body: "This is how it works:\r\n<ul><li>A portion of a glyph is published in the Type
  ID Pop Quiz.</li>\r\n<li>Try to identify the glyph and the typeface. To win, you
  need to name at least:\r\n<ol><li>typeface</li>\r\n<li>weight</li>\r\n<li>character/glyph</li></ol></li>\r\n<li>Show
  off your knowledge by casually mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it,
  when and by whom was it (first) published, and other cool stuff to impress your
  fellow Typophiles with.</li>\r\n<li>The winner produces a new challenge -- a portion
  of a glyph, black on white background, presented in a 288 x 288 pixel square, including
  a R204G000B00 1 pixel border.</li>\r\n<li>The person who posts a challenge can't
  win the next game.</li></ul>\r\nIn case of any disputes, I will act as judge, jury
  and avenging angel of wrath.\r\n\r\nIf you think this is a little too difficult,
  maybe try the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/entry_level\">Entry Level Type ID Pop
  Quiz</a> or <a href=\"http://typophile.com/intermediate_level\">Intermediary Level
  Type ID Pop Quiz</a> first.\r\n\r\nGood luck everyone, and have fun. ;^)\r\n\r\n<em>With

    Marcelo! Yes, it is Romeral by Juan Pablo de Gregorio over at <a href=http://letritas.blogspot.com/>Letritas</a>,
    which is now celebrating its two-year anniversary.\r\n\r\nThis glyph is the really
    funky alternate \u201Cf\u201D (which interestingly looks very similar to the alternate
    \u201Ct\u201D), also found in his new award-winning commercial release <a href=http://typographica.org/001143.php>Los
    Niches</a>.\r\n\r\nMaybe Lex knew the answer and refrained from saying, since
    a search for Romeral on Typophile after I posted turned up he posted the inline
    version almost exactly one year ago on this Expert Type Quiz. If he did know,
    I'm glad he let someone else figure it out, though I'm sorry that I deprived him
    the opportunity to participate fully. I do recommend to those following me that
    they do a quick Google search to make sure that this doesn\u2019t happen to them
