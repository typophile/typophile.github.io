  2 days. I usually don't write on forums because I always find someone who already
  had my problem and have a solution, but well, this is time is my time to have a
  problem unsolved. \r\n\r\nSo,\r\nI created a new typeface and installed it as .otf
  \r\nand it works well on all my programs (on mac) : textedit, open office, indesign
  \r\nbut it doesn't work on word (macintosh).... -_- it doesn't even appear in the
  list of fonts\r\nvery strange thing, it does work on word (windows). \r\nEdit :
  I also tried with .ttf (same problem)\r\n\r\nI need to make it work on mac as well.
  Anyone already had this problem and know a solution ? \r\n\r\nSo, please, \r\nHelp
  ! :( \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nSteffi. \r\n"

    of Regular, Italic, bold, BoldItalic?

    also "supports Greek"? From memory, but it did come up recently.

  body: "Hi and thank you for your help !\r\n\r\nThe name of the font is COHDA-Regular.
    It's a font made from pictograms for an visual identity. \r\nI made it with Glyphs
    software. So, I've made only one version, the regular one. \r\nHow can I know
    if the FontInfo follow the word convention ?\r\n\r\nI didn't have to change anything
    in word on my pc, it works well. \r\nAnd I did try everything on my mac, including
    support of foreign languages. Still, the font doesn't even appear. \r\n\r\nAlso
    I gave the font to a friend to try it on another pc. He told me only the first
    line of his keyboard from A to P works. All the others letters of this font doesn't
    work.... ??????????\r\n\r\nThank you again for your help :)\r\nSteffi\r\n\r\n\r\n "
