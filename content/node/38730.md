  new in the (fantastic) world of typography.\r\n\r\nSo, my last question concerned
  the choose of a typeface for a novel book body. Now I'm asking how much the ligatures
  are important in a book.\r\n\r\nCan ligatures influence the choose of a font?\r\nI
  just found the font \"Esta\" (\"Esta ligatures\") with a large number of ligatures
  (e.g. for s+h, s+t, s+k, f+r, f+y etc. etc. etc.).\r\n\r\nDo you know other typefaces
  with similar range of ligatures, suitable for a novel book body?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    If it does have them then you aught to ask - is this better than not having them
    - eg is this an improvement? And if it doesn''t, does it suffer from not having
    them? There are plenty of fonts that have poorly designed ligatures so having
    ligatures and even larger numbers of ligatures are not a mark of quality per se.
    Quality has to do with if the font supports reading - this applies to the ligatures
    as much as any other aspect. Learning which fonts support reading & which ones
    don''t can take time. The other relevant question has to do with the tone struck
    by the font when set in text. Of course a good fit with the paper to be used in
    the book is an issue too. '

  body: I must admit ligatures, especially historical forms like st-ligs etc. seem
    to ba a bit of a flovor of the month/year thing to me, especially since OT. I
    agree with Eben, ligatures do not improve legibility/readability per se. It's
    just that some faces actually need them to set properly, some don't (which in
    return doesn't make either better than the other, per se). To me Ligatures just
    seem to be a bit of an overestimated topic as of late. Like Eben, i'd choose a
    typeface rather going by things like content, style, tone/color, and yes, sometimes
    by era. If you've come that far, then you can still look if the font actually
    includes all the ligatures you might need and if thery're well drawn. To me giving
    the sheer number of ligatures first priority in chosing a typeface is like bying
    a car just because it features an ashtray while others don't.

    anyone done any research into whether or not quaints actually detract from legibility?
    Personally, I can\u2019t help but stop to notice them in many typefaces, but that
    might just be my type-geek tendencies. I wonder if the general public find it
    annoying every time <strong>st</strong> or <strong>ct</strong> pop out at them?"

    But if they detreact from legibility; I don't know. But they are obviously not
    <em>necessary</em>, while some of the other ligatures sometimes are (ff, fb, etc.).
    I too can't help noticing the st or ct ligatures in many typefaces.

  body: With the old style typefaces I find that the f-series of ligatures, besides
    being necessary in most instances, add a suble elegance to the typeset copy without
    being distracting. But I'd avoid the st, ct etc. ligatures, which draw too much
    attention to themselves in body copy (at least today; maybe four hundred years
    ago readers were used to them). Many typefaces, however, are designed such that
    ligatures aren't required; in such cases, an fi ligature, for instance would look
    silly (e.g. Trump Mediaeval).

    not important, because they are usually purely stylistic + I don\u2019t know,
    it was just common sense. </cite>\r\n\r\nI am going to have to disagree. Not emphatically,
    but gently. Using a rule of thumb rather than looking & deciding on a case by
    case basis may work most of the time but it's not ideal. \r\n\r\nThe goodness
    or badness of a ligature for text is always on the same basis - 'does it solve
    a problem in a way that supports reading'. BTW some classic 'st' & 'ct' ligs I
    have seen are quite thin and don't distract too much. And actually they may have
    even supported reading. Where as 'st' & 'ct' ligs that were made after they fell
    from common use were I think made for a different reason - to attract attention
    & look old. My guess is that the different motivation resulted in a showy presentation
    - and so they are not good for reading. But they were probably good for making
    a sign look 'old' - maybe. Also, depending on the design you might get a nice
    sy lig for instance. Keep in mind too - just because it hasn't been done doesn't
    mean that it cannot be done.  \r\n\r\nThere is also such a thing as a Spontaneous
    Ligature - where letters are allowed to overlap but retain their basic design.
    I know Verdana has at least one. "

  body: "I agree with your statement 'does it solve a problem in a way that supports
    reading'. And what I meant before, I don't think ct/st/etc ligs are <em>important</em>
    for book body type (which was the original question), you don't <em>need</em>
    them for legibility. At least not as much as some of the other ligatures; c and
    t do not collide into each other, and they are perfectly legible on their own.
    A loop between those letters, no matter how thin, attract (my) attention. :)\r\n\r\nI've
    read a book a while ago set in a Garamond-like typeface which for some reason
    had ligatures turned off (I guess), and the f collided with the b, h and other
    f's, and it was really distracting in my opinion. I think it was so apparent,
    that even non-typophiles would see it.\r\n\r\nBut I guess if you look at it on
    a case by case basis, there might be occasions where more different ligatures
    are appropriate. But I still think that such a decision would probably be made
    on a stylistic basis (to make something 'look old' or 'luxurious') rather than
    for legibility. But maybe I'm wrong. I haven't read any studies about ligatures
    in long text, if there are any. :)"

  body: I'm probably just echoing what others have said, but in general I find historical
    ligatures distracting in anything more than a couple of paragraphs. Generally
    designers make the connecting loop to round or large and this bothers me both
    as someone reading and a designer. I think it does slow readers down if the ligatures
    are poorly designed because they create uncommon word shapes.

  body: The basic f-series ligatures are necessary to avoid clumsy collision combos,
    but there is another form of collision which you can avoid manually. When an italicized
    word is followed by a punctuation mark other than a period, that punctuation mark
    should always be italic too, otherwise italic slams into upright roman. Not everyone
    agrees with this, but I insist on it as a style point in my books.

  body: Even where the f's don't collide, I do like to see ff, ffi, and ffl ligatures
    in fonts styled in the "old style" tradition with good overhangs on the f. By
    making the first f slightly shorter, as is often done, it adds a nice flow to
    the shape of the word.
