body: "Hi. This is my first post, so hopefully I'm putting it in the right place.
  I'm working on some wedding invites for myself and I've come across a design/typography
  issue that I've never encountered or really even considered. The bulk of the invites
  are (currently) set in Centaur MT Small Caps & Oldstyle Figures, with accents in
  Miss Le Gatees. The names are set in the latter (script), and I am the third (legally
  Donald Studley, III). Obviously I don't want to put \"III\" in a script face, so
  does that mean proper typography calls for \"iii\" when abbreviating numerals in
  this way? Alternatively, since this is a wedding invite and formality generally
  rules over brevity (i.e. \"at half after six\"), am I to spell out \"the third\"?\r\n\r\nAny
  insight or feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

    some images of what you have right now, plus the alternate versions you have thought
    up.

  body: I'd do what seems most aesthetically pleasing. Looking at Miss Le Gatees on
    Veer, you're completely right -- the "III" doesn't look good at all. "iii" is
    a possibility, although I prefer your idea of spelling out "the Third." Would
    "Donald Studley, 3rd" be acceptable? You can also see how using Centaur to write
    "III" looks. Centaur small caps "III" could work, but if you use Centaur and Miss
    Le Gatees in the same line as I've suggested, make sure that the color stays the
    same between words to ensure a professional look.

    go all the way, and spell it out in fully, \"Donald Studley the Third\". \r\n\r\nOf
    course, if you don't want to seem pretentious, you may opt for another solution.\r\n\r\n:)"

    roman numerals in the font. If you look at some of the wedding catalogs you will
    see what I mean

    I worked at William Arthur typesetting invitations (yawn) for a while, but I can't

  body: "guifa, I like your thinking. I do like customizing letters to suit the situation
    (time/job permitting), and I think the y might be able to reach out and integrate
    with the \"III\"s nicely. Cheers!\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Alaskan brings up
    a good point. Actually, when I introduce myself, it's Trey (nickname for third),
    but I was trying to do the proper formal, invitation thing. In fact, I'm sure
    there will be people that receive these that wouldn't even know me by my legal
    name, particularly some of her more distant family. So I guess that brings up
    another question: Is it wrong to put a nickname on something formal like a wedding
    invitation? We have already decided that \"Trey\" will be used in the ceremony
    and I also used it on the save the dates I made. Hmmn...I'll have to think that
    one over. Any further insight appreciated as well.\r\n\r\nOh, and thanks for the
    kind words, Alaskan."
