    which seem (to me) ridiculously cheap. I suspect the end product will be very
    basic. To make a proper, realistic looking handwriting font takes weeks of work
    and a lot of programming.\r\n\r\nWhich also costs a lot of money.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    (after having seen your homepage.) A LOT MORE THAN $4.95!"

    a computer. It is bad enough when it comes out of a Bic. The advent of the personal
    computer was a godsend to someone who scrawls like me.)
