  body: "Minion Pro and Garamond Premier are two different types, I believe, both
    by Slimbach. I haven't seen the Garamond Premier. \r\n\r\nI used for a long time
    Minion Pro for a book I am author and designer of, what will be out next spring.
    I had used Minion because it married well to large quotes in Poetica that I am
    writing a discussion guide for. But when the design met the art director (and
    editor) she nixed the Poetica as not readable enough in the longer quotations.
    She was, I have to admit, right. \r\n\r\nSo I ended up going with Adobe Jenson
    for everything--the italic for the quotes (Slimbach does great italics) and Jenson
    light for the rest. \r\n\r\nTo answer about Minion, to my taste it is a tad too
    condensed, tight and dark, but it is amazingly well done and useful and flexible.
    It has incredible depth--bold italic small caps in three optical weights etc.
    etc.--and everything works together. Jean Francois Porchez noted that Slimbach
    was trying to produce a rival to out do Times New Roman, and I think he succeeded.
    It may not be anyone's top favorite, but it is so damned useful and well done
    that it is hard to go wrong with it.  \r\n\r\nSo you can't go wrong with Minion
    for text, but you may go more right with another face, depending on the project.
    \r\n"

    and he is delightful in person. He has taken a job as design director (is that
    the right title?) for a book publisher, and has been totally inundated with work.
    I told him he was missed on Typophile. "

    all of my academic papers.
