  thought of [[http://www.jkrowling.net|JK Rowling's website]]. This site was created
  by [[http://www.lightmaker.com|Lightmaker]]. She's the author of the Harry Potter
  series. Her website allows you to explore and click on everything. I spent hours
  on this website while she was still writing the series because she had games and
  other fun updates about the series. This site has lots of flash but it works really
  well.\r\n\r\nHint:\r\nClick on the eraser. You can go back in time."
