  feedback on it. I know the lowercase 'e' and 'c' aren't right yet, and the upper-case
  'T' still needs work on the serifs. Other than that, please critique the hell out
  of it!\r\n\r\nDarrin Crescenzi\r\n\r\nAlso, thus far the poor face has no name.
  If anybody can think of anything more interesting than using my last name, which
  everyone besides me seems to think is a good idea, I'm all ears."

  body: "Hi Darrin,\r\n\r\nI, too, am working on my first text face, so don't consider
    this an expert critique. That said, this looks like its off to a good start. It's
    getting late, though, so this won't be an exhaustive critique. Just a few nitpicky
    things on the uppercase:\r\n\r\nA, V, U, W: could all be significantly wider.
    That spade-shaped counterform really stands out to me (like in Times New Roman),
    which is nice. It might just be from the JPG export or the fact that they're not
    perfectly lined up, but they look to be a bit tall as well.\r\nB: The counters
    are a bit boxy. Round them out a bit (especially that bottom one).\r\nC: Looks
    small. Have you thought about overshoot?\r\nE, F: serifs on crossbar look chopped
    off.\r\nG: Too dark\r\nK: I think this is your strongest letter.\r\nM: top serifs
    feel chopped off\r\nP,R: the bowl should be a little thicker, maybe?\r\nQ: nice
    tail, I think.\r\nS: A little funky.\r\nT: I kind of like the serifs on the T,
    actually.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase looks a bit patched together. I have the tendency
    to patch things together too, and for me, forcing myself to draw the letter by
    hand will help me consider the letter as a whole and how it will harmonize with
    other types of letters. I think that might help in bringing a little more unity
    to the design, and also giving it a little more of your \"voice.\"\r\n\r\nAs far
    as the name goes: I say hold off on the last name until you're really accomplished,
    knowing that Crescenzi could be a damned good for a font and you always have it
    in your deck. I'm stuck with Ross...\r\n\r\nGood luck, and hope that helped,\r\nDavid "

  body: "Thanks, David. I've done a lot of alterations and expansion on it, and I'll
    post an updated version soon. I'm not sure how the \"O\", \"G\" and \"C\" ended
    up looking so small in comparison to the rest of the upper-case alphabet; their
    overshoot is ample. But, they're fixed now.\r\n\r\nThanks for the input,\r\n\r\nDarrin"

  body: "It's looking crisp.\r\nOnly things I notice at the moment, is that I think
    that the top curves of the C, O, Q, G and S are a bit thick, compared to the thinnest
    parts of the other glyphs.\r\nAnd keep an eye at the serifs, at some places the
    serifs shouldn't be the same length on both sides, to even the balance and prevent
    chars from topping over.\r\n<a href=\"http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.2a/2.3.2.06.illusion.htm\">Check
