body: FBE seems to be the lost member of Konrad F. Bauer's "Folio" designs created
  between 1957-1962. It was used extensively by Universal Studios back in the late
  60s to the mid-70s for various TV shows such as THE ROCKFORD FILES, BANACEK, McMILLAN
  & WIFE, McCLOUD, and COLUMBO (see attatched image). It was never available as instant
  lettering from Letraset but Letterpress put out a version of it in the late 1980s.
  I had a 24 pt. sheet but lost it before the wonders of Photoshop and Fontographer
  became available to me! I have tried many times to duplicate it as working font
  but original source material (a complete alphabet of a usable size)is impossible
  to obtain. It's very similar to Swiss Bold Extended but more elegant, in my opinion.
  Does anyone know why this beautiful typeface has never surfaced as a working font,
  or why it was removed from the "Folio" family to begin with? I'd be most interested
  in any and all comments.   [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Folio Bold Extended

  body: I have a complete alphabet specimen of Folio Bold Extended in an old VGA catalog
    from 1976 - it is still in a VGA catalog of the early eighties but not as good
    print quality - contact me by clicking on my name above icon and clicking contact
    - I will e-mail you a 600 or 1200 dpi scan of the sample - it is 24pt appx.
