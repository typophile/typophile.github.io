  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm an artist and novelist, and became convinced several years ago that I should make a private font for my books. I acquired Fontographer, and have since spent many delightful hours twiddling the little sticks. I now have something I'm pretty pleased with, but have several problems. Keep in mind that I'm basically computer illiterate - terms like &quot;hinting&quot; and &quot;vectors&quot; are algebra to me. I failed algebra. So any explanations will have to be in &quot;Jane sees Spot run&quot; language. <BR> <BR>First question - I was generating my font in TrueType, but then accidentally hit the Type I button one day, and it came out sharper (why is this?). Unfortunately, a couple symbols are messed up now: the em dash lances the letter following it, and there's too much space after the apostrophe. I've checked the spacing, and it seems fine. What can I do to fix this?  <BR> <BR>Another problem, both in TrueType and Type I: I can't get the fi and fl symbols to print - they come up in a different font. <BR> <BR>Now, I'd love to be able to post a sample of my font in your critique forum, but I've never done anything like this. I have a new Dell computer with the new Windows on it. Will it have what I need to post? I read that I need jpeg or something. How do I put my font into this jpeg so you can read it? Could some kind person walk me through this process? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Keith</div>

		<div class="commentbody">GIF is an image format that most any graphic app (like Photoshop) can save out. It's perfect for type specimens - it's tight: small files with no loss or artefacts (like JPEG). As long as an image has no photos or gradations, GIF rules. <BR> <BR>Size: if you're going to upload it directly do Typophile (as opposed to putting it on a site somewhere and providing the link) don't make it <i>too</i> big! :-/  Like 600x400 or something should be good. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Keith <BR> <BR>In regard to your problems with Fontographer, it is very important that you configure your preferences quite carefully and follow the recommendations regarding metrics. [the same applies to FontLab] The Fontographer help site is useful <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/fontographer/technotes.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/fontographer/technotes.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/fontographer/technotes.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>but a bit confusing. In the days prior to Macromedia's ownership of Fontographer there was an Altsys sponsored help manual (it was known as the &quot;underground manual&quot;) that was floating around the web. Much of that is still available on site but it is scattered around. <BR> <BR>I've cribbed a bit of that to show a simple sequence for altering existing fonts (for letterpress configuration). See entry October 1 here <BR> <BR><a href="http://bielerpress.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://bielerpress.blogspot.com/">http://bielerpress.blogspot.com/</a></a> <BR> <BR>While this may or may not be useful to you note it conveys that you must pay very careful attention to your preference settings regarding character set positioning and the manner and sequence for generating the metrics. <BR> <BR>Gerald</div>
