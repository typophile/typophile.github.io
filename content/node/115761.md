  body: "I think the middle arm of the E is a bit longer than your sample, but otherwise
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tipografiaramis/egon-sans/?refby=bowfin|Egon Sans]]
    looks pretty close. Of course only the M and E give us anything to work with.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Hard to say. Very neutral, nothing really distinctive part of this /M. Can't
    explain also why but it feels hand-drawn/amateurish and most probably intentionally.
    Anyway, I'd probably start with [[http://vissol.co.uk/mavenpro|Maven]].

    of curves to straight lines in the U that make it look amateurish? Especially
    in the image provided by Adam it looks as if these are just attached circles without
    any optical corrections. The horizontal strike in the middle of B looks funny
    to. The upper outline seems to be slightly diagonal instead of horizontal. Or
    something is wrong with the transition from straight to curve. "
