body: A discussion began on Typo-L about this Agfa ad  <BR>that&#39;s been running
  in How and Print magazines.  <BR>It&#39;s not pretty &#40;that pukey gradient is
  not a side- <BR>effect of scanning&#41;, but it&#39;s a pretty good read. <BR> <BR>Stephen

  body: ' I have a poorly designed newsletter from AGFA that I cannot find just now.   Maybe
    someone can post it.    Here, the actual words are clever but the design execution
    is embarassing.    Also, memo to AGFA: six spaces after each period, please..
    <BR> <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>sorry about the &#39;-&#39; vibe <BR> <BR>How about
    ITC&#39;s &#39;cool&#39; ad with the big letter A and the dangling sunglasses?
    Any better? '
