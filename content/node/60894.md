    \u03C0\u03B1\u03B9\u03B4\u03B9\u03AC\u03C2? [That's the monotonic accentuation;
    I'm not sure what the polytonic would be.]"

  body: "I'd like to seek some help with a phrase too.\r\n\r\nI'm working on t-shirt
    for a baby, I want it to say \"My name is Christopher\".\r\n\r\nHere's what I
    got from online translators: \"\u03C4\u03BF \u03CC\u03BD\u03BF\u03BC\u03B1 \u03BC\u03BF\u03C5
    \u03B5\u03AF\u03BD\u03B1\u03B9 \u03A7\u03C1\u03B9\u03C3\u03C4\u03CC\u03C6\u03BF\u03C1\u03BFs\"\r\n\r\nIs
    this accurate?\r\n"

  body: You should find out whether Greeks typically say 'My name is...' or 'I am
    called...'. A lot of languages have a specific phrase that is used in this context.
