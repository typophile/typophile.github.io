  I collect old record albums is the covers.\r\nMany classical albums from the 1950s
  and \u201960s have spot color and interesting card stock.\r\nThe Angel label is
  often good for foil embossing, or perhaps a black dowel along the inner sleeve edge,
  to help extricate it.\r\nHere\u2019s one I picked up recently, designed by Atelier
  Cassandre in 1957.\r\nPresumably the lettering is by the master (slightly anticipating
  his YSL logo with its overlapping letters, and perhaps Avante Garde, with the skewed
  M).\r\nThe stock is off white and matte, and the title colour burnt sienna, a scheme
  often found in type specimen books of the early and mid twentieth century.\r\nThe
  fact that it only cost me a dollar, the record is in good condition, and Gilels\u2019
  playing astonishingly \uFB02uid, is a bonus!\r\n"
