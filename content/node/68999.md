body: "April 1, 2010 - Redmond, WA - Construction workers stopped the excavation for
  building 1,629 at Microsoft's Redmond campus when crews uncovered a 44MB Syquest-brand
  storage cartridge packed with astonishing archival data.\r\n\r\nVerdana and Georgia,
  two of the most widely used fonts found on nearly every computer in the world, appear
  to have had a sort of digital tryst during their years in storage and together produced
  a font called [[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/verdorgia.aspx|Verdorgia]] (see
  graphic).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Verdorgia_3813.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  new Verdorgia font data seems to have been born through an unusual process called
  'binary conception' and contains recognizable attributes from each of its well-known
  parents.\r\n\r\nDigital Fontologists were called on to the scene to evaluate the
  integrity of the data. Joshua Hadley, Type Engineer for Ascender Corporation, remarked
  \"There is a certain degree of charm about the font. One can imagine Verdana and
  Georgia conjoined in the glow of a flashing green LED and the low hum of a cooling
  fan. It's about as romantic as you get in the font software business.\"\r\n\r\nSteve
  Matteson, Type Director for Ascender Corporation, was asked to be Verdorgia's godfather.
  Under his careful tutelage Verdorgia matured into a fully-grown Mac and Windows
  compatible font with a sturdy Latin 1 character set. He said \"The discovery of
  Verdorgia brought a tear to my eye. I can't wait to see it used on the label of
  a fine bottle of wine or at least on the masthead of a counterculture newspaper.\"\r\n\r\nAll
  kidding aside, to commemorate this joyous occasion, the font aficionados at Ascender
  have agreed to make an OpenType version of the Verdorgia font available for purchase
  and instant download. It is priced at only $9.99 and for the month of April all
  proceeds will be donated to [[http://savethechildren.org|SaveTheChildren.org]] \u2013
  a charity dedicated to creating lasting change in the lives of children around the
  world.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the newly discovered Verdorgia font visit

    birth.\r\n\r\nHmm. I always thought Verdana and Georgia were brother and sister."
