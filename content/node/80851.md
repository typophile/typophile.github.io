body: "Hello! \r\n\r\nMy name is Gale and I am new to this forum but I have been a
  fan of Typophile for a long time. \r\n\r\nI am using Fontographer 4.7, for Mac OSX,
  to create a new typeface based on an existing typeface but with a radically different
  letter \"E.\"\r\n\r\nThe new typeface works great - except for one thing, the word
  spacing.\r\n\r\nI have researched and read various documents online. I have tried
  importing the metrics but nothing seems to change the extremely wide word spacing.\r\n\r\nThis
  is how I created the font. I created the new \"E\" in Illustrator. I copied and
  pasted it into a new Fontographer file. I saved the .fog file. Then, I opened the
  existing typeface which it is based on and copied and pasted each of the characters,
  one by one, into the new .fog file. I cannot remember whether I opened the Truetype
  font file or the suitcase.\r\n\r\nI exported the file as both Postscript Type 1
  for Mac and Truetype for PC.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried it, the word spacing was HUGE.
  However, the kerning and letterspacing seemed just fine!\r\n\r\nSo, I re-opened
  the .fog file of my new typeface and imported \"all metrics\" of the original typeface
  upon which my new typeface was based.\r\n\r\nIt didn't work. The word spacing of
  my new font was the same.\r\n\r\nSo I created a new .fog file and before I copied
  anything into it, I imported the metrics of the original typeface. Then, I copied
  and pasted the new \"E\" and a few other characters to test it out. The resultant
  word spacing was worse than before.\r\n\r\nSo... I would be most appreciative if
  somebody would kindly give me some advice.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nGale\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    width of the space glyph" but I will try that and post a reply whether or not
    I succeeded. I'm an embarrassed and grateful novice.

    perfectly. I determined the width of the space glyph in the original font and
    changed that of the new font to match it. \r\n\r\nGale"
