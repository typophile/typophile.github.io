  body: It seems to want to be something literal but it&#39;s still pretty vague &#40;I
    thought it was a submarine at first&#41;. Maybe it needs an extra visual element
    to put it context &#40;stars if a space ship, water if a boat, bubbles if submarine...or
    maybe both depending on use?&#41;

  body: I hope its not a space shuttle you know what happened to the last one. I like
    the look it reminds me of the movie 2000 leagues under the sea. Maybe research
    60&#39;s logos. The type in the large size seems to float in the space, in the
    smaller size its tighter and more cohesive. Maybe you need to stroke the type
    in larger sizes. Do you have a color scheme yet? Kids are all about color.

  body: I love the colors Andrew, did you think of a gradient like the shine on a
    craft would change colors on its length. The lighter green might work better against
    a black background, but that depends on how you are going to use it. That would
    be a fun splash page logo using DHML or flash.

  body: Well, Dan, I would love to do flash for our website, but our libraries website
    is accessed by so many types of users. The webmasters want to keep the design
    as simplistic as possible.  <BR>For the visually impaired and slow of modem. <BR>
    <BR>I also did try a gradient, but at a small size I  <BR>found its application
    distracting. <BR> <BR>Dan and Darrel, thanks for sticking with me on this one.

  body: 'Hi Andrew. <BR> <BR>This reminds me of the type/shoe print Tanya did a while
    back. Nice work. I also like the submarine, spaceship duality. A couple of comments:  <BR>-
    Consider elongating the engine to fill the void caused by the L. <BR>- The lighter
    version is better at small sizes, but weak larger. <BR>- The RTU ligature looks
    a little odd &#40;moreso large size&#41;. Consider making it just a TU lig and
    introducing a bit of space in between the RT. <BR>- Color. I might do a two tone
    paint job, like most boats &#40;the space shuttle for that matter also&#41;. One
    color above the waterline, another below. Maybe light blue above, navy below,
    red and orange stripes on a light blue engine, with orange flames. Even if it
    were only one color, I still might go Light on top darker on the bottom, with
    the engines filled with a tint. <BR> <BR>Fun stuff. I wanna go back in time! <BR>

  body: The &#34;cleaner&#34; exhaust is too rigid for such a fluid voyager. Try either
    giving it a little curve, or making some flame spikes/tips.

  body: Maybe instead of showing exhaust ... it is supposed to be a submarine, right?
    ... show water movement. ... or another thought ... combine those you&#39;ve shown.
    So the outside would be wavy, but then you would have the rigidity of the other
    on the inside. I think Big Daddy Roth did the best flame art, you might look for
    his work for inspiration. Also, check out House Industries <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?page=custom&amp;sub=lettering&amp;num=18"
    target="_blank">custom</a> work. As it happens they took Big Daddy&#39;s lettering
    style and created typefaces.  <BR> <BR>Did you guys see the east/west chopper
    competition with the big daddy roth bike? So hot!
