  I came across a couple real cuties....Swag...\r\n\r\nOh wait, not that Maxim,\r\n\r\nlets
  try again\r\n\r\nDear Maxim,\r\n\r\nDo you have any pix of Cyrillic before it was
  latinized?  And would you explain a little about how Cyrillic came to use Latin
  characters, and numbers, forwards and backward, and combinations of two latin charecters
  equaling one Cyrillic character?\r\n\r\nIs it just me, or does it seem like the
  Russians went batcrap crazy when they did this?  Well at least their great composers
  always make sense.  I'm off to listen to Shstakovich's 24 preludes and fugues....\r\n\r\nTo
  Russia,\r\nWith love..."

  body: "<em>Cyrillic writing derived from Greek</em>\r\n\r\nSpecifically from Byzantine
    Greek. The connections between some Cyrillic and Greek letters isn't immediately
    apparent to people who are only familiar with the classical and modern Greek alphabet
    norms. I didn't come to understand all of the relationships until just last year
    when I was working on a typeface for Byzantine sigillography and numismatics,
    containing many variant forms tracing more than 1,000 years of Byzantine letterforms.
    A light went on for me when I saw that H sometimes occurs as a variant form of
    N in Byzantine uncial, explaining how it came to represent that phoneme in Cyrillic."

    Russian alphabet, so hard E is absent.\r\n\r\nAs to the original question, though,
    I am perplexed. Cyrillic is what it always was, it hasn't had additional Latin
    letters introduced, although it is true some national alphabets of the Cyrillic
    type have added letters from Latin, but not recently - such as I and J."

    who came up with it first (in the 16th century?). In fact, Karad\u017Ei\u0107\u2019s
