  0-9, and the circle, and then am using those elements as components to create larger
  numbers within the circles (37, 45, etc.)\r\n\r\nSome work fine, but none of my
  1s or 3s are showing up as components. Nothing looks different about those particular
  glyphs in comparison to others. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

    cannot place a glyph as a component if it contains a mix of outlines and components."

  body: "It's definitely something to do with path direction. \r\n\r\nWhat fixed it
    was by setting the path direction of the glyphs that weren't showing up to TrueType.
    But all the others are set to PostScript.\r\n\r\nThe manual isn't all that clear
    on the whole path direction issue.\r\n\r\nWill it cause problems if some paths
    are set to TT while the others are PS?"
