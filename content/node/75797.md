  day care center, for children.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics I am after are trustworthiness,
  cheerfulness, playfulness, warm reception. \r\n\r\nThe style of the website will
  follow the above directions and probably will use illustrations and decorations.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

    black cut would kick teletubby butts\u2026\r\n\r\nBut seriously, I think DIN Round
    is one of the most friendly, warm and cheerful looking typefaces out there (especially
    in the bolder weights), while still keeping trustworthy.\r\nAnd it\u2019s not
    overused like, say, Gotham rounded."

  body: "Dunno, I'd find DIN much too stiff and mechanical, even when it's rounded...\r\n\r\nYou
    might like something in the direction of <a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=sauna&id2=info\">Sauna</a>,
    or maybe <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Bree\">Bree</a>?\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Wait, I just saw you specified this is for a website. Are you looking for a webfont
    to use for text, or just something for headings?\r\n\r\nEdit 2 (Sorry, I'll stop
    now): FF Tisa might be great for both.\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/ff_tisa/"
