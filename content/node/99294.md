  for a long time, but i was busy doing interesting stuff.\r\nLately i have been working
  on a new blog (in Hebrew) called \"The Hebrew Type Ministry\" (name inspired by
  the \"Ministry of Type\" blog), which is a common online knowledge base about Hebrew
  Typography. \r\n\r\nIn the last month or so, i have been working alongside Israeli
  type designers in order to create the bilingual [[http://goo.gl/blvg1|\"Hebrew Typography
  Status Report 2012\"]] , which includes many type samples and catalogs of typefaces
  designed in Israel between 2012 to 2013. The document is freely available for download."
