    to make the font look more like real handwritting with variation and context dependence
    - where a lc l conncect to another l vs. connecting with some other letter vs.
    staring or finnishing a word for instance. Or if the face isn't going to do that
    and is going to be more like an older commercial 'script' font like this one.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/shelley-script/\r\n\r\nwhere
    the connections are more calculated & less casual. Forst instance, in the second
    case you would have to redesign your lc 'l' to look less ackward when it connects
    to other letters.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of other observations that could be made
    but I think they would all assume (falsely) some insight into what you had decided
    about this first issue.\r\n\r\n"

    the uneven color could also be attended to, unless you're going for a very informal
    look.\r\n\r\nI agree with Eben...you might want to look into OT so that the words
    flow better as connected glyphs."

  body: Though it's true that OpenType can help this font do more things, you can
    work on the existing outlines to get a more smooth, realistic connecting flow.
    Note how the instrokes and outstrokes of some letters collide with, or miss other
    in/outstrokes.Find ways to get the in and out strokes to all fall in the same
    place, so that letters appear to join. For instance, put a and l together in your
    FontLab metrics window. See how the blob on the bottom left of l interrupts the
    apparent flow? If you can change that part of l so it looks like a and l are written
    together, then you've improved not only the al join, but also anything that joins
    the same way. Fix the joins of i, j, l, m, n, r, u, and y, and it will improve
    a lot. you may have to change the spacing of letters to get the joins looking
    good. Please post updates!

    I would try to figure out how to make it stand out. Personally I might think about
    turning David's -generally valid- complaint about the \"dark spots\" into a feature!
    So maybe try putting MORE of that in... The one thing I think needs to be tamed
    though are the caps: I think they're really too all over the place (I mean in
    relation to the lc). Most of them are fine, but like the \"I\" and \"T\" are going
    to be trouble. The caps also have more (too much) color variance I think.\r\n\r\n*
    Yes, this is based on your unique handwriting. But consider how\r\nmany people

  body: ">I suspect that generally makes the exit strokes too long though.\r\n\r\nWell,
    I don't want to do too much of Phat's work for him, but not all exit stokes have
    to join, and they can head in different directions to touch the following letter
    high or low, and not all characters require an exit stroke. Flexibility.\r\n\r\nMistral
    rather does it the other way, by having some very pronounced entry strokes.\r\n\r\nCaflisch
    is a good example of what I'm suggesting.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a designer really
    wants to have a joining strategy that uses both entry and exit strokes, here's
    a technique I developed in Handsome: create a very short \"middle of the join\"
    angled stroke to place in the mask layer at both sides of each glyph, bisected
    by the sidebearing, then make sure every joining stroke overlaps it perfectly
    -- entry strokes from above, exit strokes from below. I suspect Roger Excoffon
    did that sort of thing. \r\n"

    would not change shape depending on what letter comes before or after it - especially
    \ when they connect. And when there is no letter either before or after it that
    would be different too. Look carefully and you will see, context matters - alot!
    Without contextual variation your font cannot *really* look like handwritting.
    It will look disjointed - like it does now. If on the other hand you don't want
    to do opentype & scripting then to make a good looking font you will probably
    need to start thinking about the font as a script font & not as handwritting."

  body: The scripting is actually *much* easier than you would think. Don't worry
    at all! You can search for threads that apply on typophile right here. There is
    almost certainly somebody who has done something similar already & they may have
    code to try. But even before you worry about code I recommend that you start by
    looking at the variations you naturally get as a result of putting one letter
    or another next to each other. For instance, most people connect an a at the base
    of the a or an o from the top of the o. Compare how they connect to an r. Compare
    too how they connect to an l. When you have observed enough you will be able to
    script in a way that suits your handwritting.

  body: "Yes, Listen to Eben!  ;D\r\n\r\nYou might get most of your letters to join
    and only have 2 or 3 troublemakers. Then, OpenType can solve that problem. Maybe
    you only have to add a few lines of code to change things contextually. You wouldn't
    need to change everything. You could do it with alternate single letters or with
    ligatures. \r\n\r\nI do think it is all much easier if your joins are all on the
    outstroke (right side). Then, if an o or t joined from near the x-height, it could
    hit the next letter wherever it looked good, even if a or e joins lower. \r\n\r\nNick
    points out that not all exit strokes have to join. True! In fact, not all letters
    have to have an \"exit stroke\". Look at your writing. If you lift the pen between
    letters, see if there's a typical place where that happens. I usually lift my
    pen after a z, p, v, and sometimes other letters if they are right in the middle
    of a word. Some people's handwriting doesn't join much at all. There are several
    typefaces out there that are based on handwriting that is really more like printing,
    and they don't join anywhere. If it gives a realistic effect of something written
    by hand, then it doesn't matter if things all join the same way. \r\n\r\nHandwriting
    is really quite difficult to adapt to type. It has to do with how regular, and
    how joined it is. My handwriting is very loopy and inconsistent, and I've tried
    to make a typeface out of it. Even with OpenType, I would have a lot of work to
    get something looking like my handwriting. Not worth it, since it's illegible
    anyway.  \r\n"

    you could have better spacing: everything looks tight, and some of the letters
    themselves are narrow, so it might help make it more readable to open the spacing,
    and maybe widen h, m and n. Since b, c, o, p, q and s are so wide, they interrupt
