  body: This is an old display font from the seventies called Churchward Design. The
    weight on the record jacket is Medium. Unfortunately, the only weight of it that
    I know has been digitized is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/churchward/design-lines/"
    target="_blank">Churchward Design Lines</a>. Perhaps they will digitize some of
    the other &#40;more useful&#41; weights some time.
