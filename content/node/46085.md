body: "When I think of fonts, I tend to think about the usual fonts we are told to
  use in college and high school which is Times or Times New Roman. Then after those
  two, Arial comes to mind. I\u2019ve never really had the opportunity to explore
  fonts and find the one that I like or fit me. I soon found that no matter what I
  write it will be in either of those three fonts, but what about if I want something
  creative and fun? I had no idea where to go to find a font that represents me. The
  typical fonts that are on Word don\u2019t express who I am, so I went searching
  to try and find myself in type. I was lucky to find one that I thought expressed
  my love of the one thing that is most important to me, music. The font that I found
  is Bleeding Cowboy. The reason I love this font is because of the bleeding effect
  because I bleed music and it is what I live for as well as the feminine touch it
  has with the curls on the end of certain letters. That\u2019s what makes this font
  perfect."

    as a comment to my comment, I would like to see the card.\r\n\r\nTake a few minutes
    and look through this web site,\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/resources\r\n\r\ngo
    through some of the tutorials about type, it is interesting and fun."

  body: "Hi Christilisa,\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to see someone take an interest in
    typography and importance. I would like to know what your experience lies in (are
    you a graphic designer? Musician?). Some would call what you were describing as
    the \"voice\" of the typeface. This one does have a very strong voice, although
    I may disagree that it is bleeding. Have you ever done any screen printing? It
    looks like a grungy, low -quality (not an insult) screen print, which seems more
    indicative of a specific kind of music. I guess what I'm saying is that other
    people won't necessarily perceive it as your identity, which is the point of a
    logo. The name of the typeface is secondary to what it actually looks like. Nancy
    has given you a good resource to look at for some basics, but maybe there are
    one or two things I could offer as something to watch out for. Bleeding Cowboy
    is what is described as a \"Display\" typeface, which means that it would be fine
    for big headlines, or a logo, but not as much for body copy (smaller text, such
    as the contact info on your business card) becuase it can get illegible (and at
    a whole page, it would be nearly impossible to read). I would recommend pairing
    it with a more normal typeface, as it would help emphasize the character of \"Bleeding
    Cowboy.\" One other rule that typographers and designers live by is to <em>never</em>
    distort the text from its proportions. By warping the word Eclectic Music, it
    destroys the fine tuning that the type designer put into the curves and shapes.
    Ultimately, it has a tendency to make it look more computer-designed, and less
    by a human hand. Instead, try manipulating the size and angle of each individual
    letter.\r\n\r\nI quickly mocked up a sample, may not be the best solution, but
    it touches my points:\r\n\r\n"
