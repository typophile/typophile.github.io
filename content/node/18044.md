body: Okay, so i have an OpenType font that I've been developing with some extended
  language support (CE + Cyrillic) and it works fine on Windows XP, with all the features
  being accesible in InDesign. However, when installed on the Mac none of the features
  are accessible unless the font is installed directly to the Adobe Fonts folder.
  Any help on this one?

  body: Are you saying that the font doesn't behave as expected when it is in /Library/Fonts/,
    but it works in /Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts? I'm a bit skeptical.
    Did you try it in /Library/Fonts/ after clearing system font caches?

  body: "yes. yes. yes.\r\n\r\nI think there must be something about adding cyrillic
    support that does this. I'm actually thinking of two cases where I have seen this
    kind of behavior on Mac OSX with OT fonts containing cyrillic support. The only
    way I could get the features to show up when installed to the /Library/Fonts folder
    was to export the font as a dfont."

    is similar to a font manager. What you're information implies is that InDesign
    is in some way bypassing ATS and using the font directly. \r\nIs it possible that
    InDesign is overcoming a Mac OS deficiency of some kind?"

  body: "Paul, what I'm about to say might not relate directly with your problem,
    but may lead you to another possible solution.\r\n\r\nMy specific problem was
    in Quark 6, with an .otf font that covered Western and Central European Latin
    (no Greek or Cyrillic). The supported codepages selected were Latin 1, Latin 2:
    Eastern Europe, Turkish and Windows Baltic.\r\nAs you probably know, Quark 6 only
    supports Western characters in OpenType PS (.otf) fonts, nonetheless I was getting
    CE characters when typing Western. After some fiddling, I found out that adding
    Greek to the supported codepages would fix the problem.\r\n\r\nHere's [[Adam Twardoch]]'s
    explanation:\r\n<em>There is a bizarre bug in the Adobe font driver (ATM or the
    one built into Mac OS X) with respect to the \"Windows Greek codepage\" flag.
    If a font is flagged as \"Roman\" + \"CE\", then ATM thinks that the primary codepage
    of the font is CE, if the font is flagged as \"Roman\" + \"Cyrillic\", then ATM
    thinks that the primary codepage is Cyrillic, but if the font is flagged as \"Roman\"
    + \"CE\" + \"Greek\" or \"Roman\" + \"Cyrillic\" + \"Greek\", then ATM thinks
    that the primary codepage of the font is Roman. QuarkXPress only likes fonts that
    the system says the primary codepage is Roman. So in short, it may be help to
    activate the \"Windows Greek\" codepage flag.</em>"
