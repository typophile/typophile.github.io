body: "I've made a couple of quick videos to show the difference in editing between
  Fontographer and FontLab. FontLab has so much more power than Fontographer, so I'm
  not complaining overall. But I AM frustrated by some of the actual drawing/editing
  behaviors.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.typesetit.com/video/fog-demo.mov|In this first video]],
  I show how I use Fontographer to connect two letters to make a ligature. In this
  case, I used the \"r\" to the letter \"k.\"\r\n\r\n I began by removing the overlap
  of two paths, then using the merge tool to get rid of unwanted nodes. With Fontographer,
  the interpretation of that merge is so much more intuitive with regard to what I
  want it to do. The amount of editing is limited.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.typesetit.com/video/fl-demo.mov|In
  this second video,]], I perform the identical task of making the same ligature.
  But what happens in FontLab with regard to the merge (in FontLab, the delete button
  does the same task as Merge in Fontographer) is a bit frustrating. Its interpretation
  of what I want it to do is different and requires more editing on my part. \r\n\r\nWith
  this simple task demonstrated in the two videos, I'm able to perform more than three
  times faster in Fontographer than in FontLab.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Is it that I am just
  very accustomed to how Fontographer works, or is there something I could do differently
  in FONTLAB that would make this process easier (and, more like how Fontographer
  performs)? \r\n\r\nOr is my interpretation that Fontographer is more intuitive a
  correct one?\r\n\r\nP.S. I hope the videos explain what I mean... I didn't want
  to have to try explaining by typing all of the steps out.  :)"

    you find Fontographer's tools more inutitive because you've been using them for

    familiarity. You're right about the rotation and scaling in Fontographer (FOG).
    \ However, I find that the way Fontographer works with Bezier paths and nodes

    to Fontographer since both programs were originally created by ALTSYS."

    now some of these threads won't make sense to new viewers.  My apologies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELOW
    is the original POST of this thread:\r\n\r\nAdam Twardock mentioned in another
    thread:\r\n\r\n<em>I've checked and Fontographer 5.0 (soon to be released) behaves
    the same way as the Type 1 spec and the same way as FontLab Studio.</em>\r\n\r\nCool.
    I know and understand that FontLab is far more popular and powerful a tool than
    Fontographer, but I'm looking forward to the release and intend to get it. \r\n\r\nI've
    been using FontLab exclusively since I got it about 7 weeks ago. And while I've
    learned a great deal, and recognize the overall superiority, there are things
    about how FontLab functions that simply put, are inferior to Fontographer from
    my point of view. It's probably more a matter of my being used to Fontographer,
    as I have used it since 1988. \r\n\r\nIn fact, over the years I often found myself
    using Fontographer to do work that most people would do in Adobe Illustrator.
    I simply liked Fontographer's drawing methods better than Illustrator. It seems
    to be so much more intuitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are definitely things I like
    about FontLab over Fontographer, but my hope is that Fontographer's upgrade will
    incorporate some of those features FontLab has with the already good features
    of Fontographer.\r\n"

    of lassoing them with the mouse and deleting them all at once. AFAIK if you do
    this FL tries to match the curve, so will keep it smooth. (Might be a prefs issue
    too.)\r\nEdit: Alternately using the eraser (\"2\" key) to remove those nodes
    keeps curves smooth for me."
