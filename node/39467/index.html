  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Is there a typeface you think is good (or at least, not bad), but that you would not use because of some association with something that has nothing to do with it's graphic qualities?

Maybe it was designed by your X's mother in law, or a wing-nut in an aluminum foil hat and you don't condone that sort of thing... What ever. It has nothing to do with the typeface itself.

I've found the recent spate of threads about bashing typefaces a little puzzling and difficult to take seriously. If you don't like a typeface don't use it. It's just a typeface. (And it was probably designed by a regular here... )
David's comments about Futura interesting, and I agree, but I would have described it differently.

i think types are versatile/independent graphics... i can't remember a typeface doomed to be forever associated with particular events or people, and i think this is how it should be. I cannot embed my feelings in to it, we should instead "exercise" it, free them from that (this for a non private design of course).

Nazis were evil, but fairly adept at graphic design. I think the Nazi party is a great example of the power that graphic design can have.

Not sure I'd group the other two in with the Nazis. They weren't evil nor as talented graphic design-wise.</div>

Blackletter, to me, has such a varied legacy that it seems to withstand a lot. It can mean Christmas cards, motorcycle gangs, hair metal bands, illuminated bibles, awards, etc...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I refuse to use Helvetica because designers never shut up about it and I just don’t want to think about it anymore. 

There are a lot of Berthold fonts I would love to use, but I won’t touch anything from that foundry anymore. I’m tempted to make a knockoff of Akzidenz Super to use with Linotype’s Basic Commericial, tho, because Akzidenz is just so amazing.

In my student work, I won’t touch novelty fonts/display type anymore. One thing I‘ve learned is that a clean layout using well-chosen text or jobbing faces stands out above the crowd of students who stay up all night finishing over-the-top work with the latest novelties. It irritates some of my professors, but in a job interview people love it when I can explain the historic and graphic reasons for picking a face instead of just saying “I saw someone do this in a magazine and thought it looked cool.“</div>

Here in Istanbul, it is insanely overused by cheap hairdressers and textile shops (which happen to be everywhere), plus it's often distorted, extended...

		<div class="commentbody">I wouldn't use Helvetica very quickly, for no real reason. Maybe the fact that there are people who say it's the only typeface you need, I don't use it on purpose. It also gives designs a blandness I might not want. And even if I want that, I can achieve that with a different typeface just as well.

I wouldn't use Avant Garde either, because it was used to death again a while ago by those so called 'trendwhore' designers. And of course the Alternates...

The same goes for DIN.

Don't get me wrong, I don't hate these typefaces, I like them sometimes when I see them used well. But I wouldn't use them myself.</div>

because it's ugly and... ugly.

Compatil
because it's a Frankenstein kind of type design. It's dead, but it's alive.


very subjective, but nevertheless.
