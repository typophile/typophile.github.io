body: "Hello all; this is my first time posting, though I've come here reading off
  and on. I have been learning all I can so I can speak intelligently about this topic,
  but please forgive me (and correct me) if I use some of the technical terms incorrectly
  or too broadly.\r\n\r\nThe attached logo was found on some rolls of metallic stickers
  that our insurance agency has been using for various purposes for at least twenty
  years, if not longer. We are currently looking into branching out with our marketing
  methods, which has of course left us in need of a distinctive \"look\" -- and we
  would like to use this logo, as it is (in our opinion) rather handsomely suited
  to the \"tone\" of the business we are pursuing, as well as able to give us some
  brand continuity. Unfortunately, the gentleman who designed the logo for us is long
  deceased, and we have no original files anywhere either.\r\n\r\nNow, even after
  hours of searching and browsing through font identification tools, none of us have
  been able to determine which typeface is used here. The interesting flourishes don't
  help, I'm sure...\r\n<!--break-->\r\nAll I have been able to determine is that it
  is \"related\" to the Garamond family -- look at the serifs on the arms of the T
  (they point both up and down) plus the triangular upper arm of the K, the downward-pointing
  serif on the top of the S, and the single serif on the right vertical of the N.
  Another feature I noticed is the peculiarly slanted apex of the A -- as if it were
  drawn with a thin nib pen rather than coming to a \"pure\" vertex. However, it seems
  more lightweight and more narrow than any of the various Garamond faces I've looked
  at, or any of the \"similar\" fonts I've found. Of course, the fact that the sample
  I have been working with is so small probably hasn't helped, and neither have the
  odd embellishments, like the tails on the K and the R, the weirdly tall S, raised/underlined
  O's, and the...it's not a ligature even though I want to call it that...between
  the N and the S.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has some clue as to what this might be, or even
  just a better way of searching for the face or more vocabulary to use (e.g., what
  are the terms for the swoosh between the N and the S, and for the raised O's?) it
  would be greatly appreciated!"

    recreate it is to have a competent designer redraw it.
