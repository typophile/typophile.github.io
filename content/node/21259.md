  modern would go well with the anachronistic feel of the logo I intend to use for
  my freelance illustration. Am I totally off base? If not Futura and N.C.S., then
  what?\r\n\r\nAs always, your help is much appreciated."

    concept? digital? traditional? -- or both?  did you draw the "R"? '

  body: "My work is all across the board. I do concept art for games, spot illustration
    for magazines, comic illustration for books, digital arts like pixelart, and some
    graphic design. It's hard to pin down.\r\n\r\nI did draw the logo from scratch.
    The \"R\" is my doing.\r\n\r\nI'm currently putting together my portfolio and
    resume's grid and the next step'll be to slap the information down. I'm currently
    fontless, though. It's always much easier when you're making these decisions for
    someone else!\r\n\r\nEdit: I apologize if this would better go into the <em>Critique</em>
    subforums.\r\n"

  body: "I think I opted for Futura out of frustration; Neutraface might be a better
    option. After all, most the people looking at my work are going to be Art Directors
    or other designers and they'd have seen Futura for the gazillionth time.\r\n\r\nWhat
    serifs for body would you recommend if I went that route?"

    family, Neutraface would be a good option, as you say familiarity breeds\u2026etc.\r\nTim"

  body: "Logo is one thing, resum\xE9 - another thing, and your portfolio - new story.
    \r\n\r\nJust to be clear about the portfolio: one portfolio with different samples?
    -- comic illustration , concept, spot etc etc?  real- world-published work, or
    you're on the way to be famous? :) "

  body: "Heh, real published stuff! I've been working for five years at a low budget
    design shop and I want to move on to bigger and better. It'll mean a pay cut,
    likely, but I need a place with upward mobility. You could say I was as high up
    in my current company as was possible.\r\n\r\nWhile doing that, I've done freelance
    for novels, comics, games, etc.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that my online portfolio will
    be very cleanly laid out so as to bring some order to the chaos that is \"samples
    in a slew of categories.\" My physical portfolio for interviewing for the next
    graphic design job will be, and rightly so, focused on design.\r\n\r\nI'm a stronger
    illustrator than designer. I'd say proper font useage is my weakest area. I'm
    constantly reading books on the subject and am eager to improve."
