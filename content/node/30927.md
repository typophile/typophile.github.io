    do notice the transitions in your curves have tension points and don't progress
    smoothly out of the straights.  Generally, the glyphs look too grid imposed.\r\nYou
    might try putting a copy of all the glyphs (as you have them now) on the mask
    layer and then releasing points in the glyph layer and adjusting them to smoother
    transitions. This is also good eye training.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Chris describes in the curves.'

  body: I am not 100% sure if what I am saying is the same as Chris & Jason, but I
    would venture that maybe some of the curves have goten too thick where they bend.
    This happens when your curves ar mechnically perfect but are not optically perfect.
    The two things are quite different. That said overall if find the design quite
    sensitive and pleasant despite what seems to be a grid-ish orientation. Congradulations.

    I know its a bit difficuilt to give feedback on a non-latin\r\n> typeface and
    most of you are not at all familier with devanagiri\u2026\r\n\r\nIt was reported
    in \"Times of India\" that \"India has a third of world's illiterates\".\r\n\r\nsee
    http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/916814.cms\r\n\r\nSo it does not
    surprise that a third of the Indian population does not know how to spell the
    script name \"Devanagari\".\r\n\r\n- Some illiterates write \"devnagiri\".\r\n-
    Other illiterates write \"devanagiri\".\r\n \r\nThat's bizarre (\"giri\" denotes
    \"mountain\" in both Hindi and Sanskrit,\r\nsee also http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/itmanual2003.pdf)\r\n\r\nWho
    wants to design letters of a script should at least know how to write the name
    of the script, shouldn't he?\r\n\r\nSatyam eva jayate."

  body: "I concur against Uli.\r\nI'd say (also not knowing Devanagiri) that in general
    you should keep shapes from getting too close to each other. I'm going to refer
    to characters by coordinates here, to make it easier. Fourth row third from the
    left would be (4,3).\r\nThe related little enclosed areas in (4,2), (4,3), and
    (8,1) will probably close up at smaller sizes. The two shapes in (1,2) will almost
    definitely merge; (7,2) might also. In some characters your top two strokes are
    probably too close for comfort; probably there should be a standard distance between
    the two that you can stick to most of the time. I'm looking at (1,1), (1,2), (1,5),
    (3,3), (7,4), and maybe (6,4) here. And also, I think that the two lines in (5,3)
    should either connect or stay a bit farther apart. If I'm wrong about any of this
    for some reason feel free to ignore the offending part. On a positive front, I
    think it looks very sturdy, and I like the rounded DIN-style corners a lot. Unfortunately,
    I'm not qualified to offer further praise."
