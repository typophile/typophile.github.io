body: I just cleaned up the painful rehearsal schedule that my school's Shakespeare
  club created, and I recently got some poster reference books, so now I'm wondering
  where I can find examples of good schedule design. Other than in Edward Tufte's
  books, which I already have, in what books can I find examples of well-designed
  schedules? I'm not looking for any type of schedule in particular.

  body: "I suppose the best schedules are those that are thought-out solutions to
    the problems at hand. In this sense, looking at other schedules would just obfuscate
    your solution, because they might encourage you to try something fancy when a
    simple list might work best.\r\n\r\nThis is of course the kind of design that
    is best when it's invisible: nobody will give it a second thought if it works
    well, but people will be cursing you for months if it doesn't. Any kind of complex
    iconography or code system tends to confuse people, in my experience. For something
    like a rehearsal schedule, I would want to get a personalized calendar with just
    the dates I needed to show up on listed for me. You can set up this data in Excel,
    then export it to Word and even Illustrator and InDesign, I believe. "

    backward as my projects are never so complex.
