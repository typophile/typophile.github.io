  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I&rsquo;m working on a font I started a few years ago that is based on handwriting from the 1800s. My experience with various alternate figure style is pretty limited, but I don&rsquo;t see a style or feature to fit what I want to do. Hopefully I can figure out how to get an image to show. Basically I want to create figures that when triggered by the dollar sign / numbers / period come in like superiors. I write checks like this and have seen samples of it handwritten, but don&rsquo;t know if this is done typographically. I haven&rsquo;t started building any feature code yet, so I&rsquo;m very open to suggestions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Would you show us the contrasting form? You could of course create two fonts for this - one with your &lsquo;monetary figures&rsquo; and one with lining or tabular or what ever you like. Or you could build a single font with stylistic alternates built in. The question is - who do you want to be able to access the feature. People who have CS3 or people who just have whatever ships with MS or Apple or Linux? If it&rsquo;s the later than a separate font makes some sense since the &lsquo;feature&rsquo; will be more accessible. Another angle is that you could force it&rsquo;s use in an OT font when a $ sign ( or other currency sign) is present.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was thinking of doing this as a strictly OT version. So my thoughts were to code it in where a dollar sign followed by a string of number followed by a period would be followed by superior figures. That way it wouldn&rsquo;t come up in unwanted places. I&rsquo;d have to experiment to get the feature code to work, but there is probably a way. I&rsquo;m not sure if this would go under a calt feature or perhaps even a case feature. Stylistically I think it works for a handwriting style font. I just have the original CS of creative suite, but I think if I get it to work for that CS3 would also.</div>

And of course this would all fail, if the user would use a different currency symbol or would add commas or spaces.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">So would I have to create 100 superior figure ligatures ( .00 .01 .02 &hellip; ) to follow the period? I suppose that could work, if there isn&rsquo;t a simpler way. Maybe then »Clig« would be the way to go. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t carry the dollar side beyond a thousand as the cents would become a bit trivial.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Since the only real ligature I would use for the cent side would be for an even dollar amount (00), could I create a special set of Monetary Superiors?

<p>sub dollar @figure period @figure' by @msup;

Of course, I have no experience with creating fractions either, so excuse me if this makes no sense.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Good point that you would only need a single &ldquo;00&rdquo; ligature, if that&rsquo;s really what you want. You don&rsquo;t want small numbers for everything? And if you have numerators or superiors that suit the purpose, I think you could just use those, e.g.</p>
<p><code>sub period @figures' by @figures_superior;
sub period @figures_superior @figures' by @figures_superior;</code></p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m leaving out extra context, like preceding currency and numbers, like Georg wrote, but you can put as much of that in as necessary.)</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that different countries write such figures differently &ndash; such as using a comma where we in the U.S.A. use a period. Your font could very well end up annoying people in Europe! In theory, you could make different contextual substitution rules depending on the particular currency symbol that&rsquo;s used, but in my experience, these tricky kinds of things usually end up getting too complicated &ndash; and one ends up making the substitution discretionary (i.e &lsquo;dlig&rsquo;) instead of on by default (i.e. &lsquo;liga&rsquo;).</p>
<p>It seems like there might be a more clever way to do all this, but rarely does such cleverness come to me immediately.  :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks all.
I should do more research on all this. I know this could easily get overly complicated, so I will try to figure out the wider scope of things so I don&rsquo;t go &ldquo;annoying people in Europe&rdquo;. I just started working with OT less than a year ago and its a big learning curve for me, but I&rsquo;m getting there. If all goes well this will be my 3rd OT font.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very grateful to be able to use the Typophile forum. Its a wonderful resource with a fabulous group of people.</p>
