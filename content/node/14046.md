body: "Hi Typophiles,\r\n\r\nAfter incessant delays, I'm finally getting around to
  working on my own studio's logotype. I previously conducted exhaustive typeface
  research, surveying the sans landscape for fresh and worthy entries into that classification.\r\n\r\nConsidering
  the studio's core capabilities are user experience consulting and interaction/information
  design for screen-based media, I was looking for a typeface inspired by screen and
  with a single-story \"a\" and \"g.\"\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the studio is to provide
  superlative online experiences through interaction/information and visual design,
  by way of customer-centered methodologies and Web standards. I would also like to
  focus on type direction for corporate/brand identity, and logotypes in particular.\r\n\r\nAs
  far as usage of the logotype, again, it will mainly be screen-based and for basic
  Corporate ID materials.\r\n\r\nI have happily settled on Our Type's/Fred Smeijers'
  (http://www.ourtype.be/) excellent Sansa/Sansa Condensed. Our very own Hrant cemented
  the deal for me, remarking:\r\n\r\n\"I just took another look at that design, and
  I had to smile at how much it seems to be inspired by the screen!  :-)\" \r\n\r\nYes,
  he did use an explanation point and an emoticon. :)\r\n\r\nI've done some sketching
  and exploration of the forms, and decided to set the logotype in all caps for a
  couple of reasons that will become apparent. My present agenda is twofold, to decide
  between Sansa and Sansa Condensed and to choose a weight -- or a weight between
  weights. I have yet to purchase the fonts, so the gifs are not the final outlines,
  but generated by way of Our Type's (innovative, yet slightly unwieldy) Flash GUI
  and screen captures.\r\n\r\nI'll begin work on a more polished sketch of the primary
  concept after choosing a width and weight. To explain it literally, I'm seeing an
  all caps setting with no spaces between the words, and an \"HD\" ligature. Additionally,
  I want to shape either the \"D\" itself or it's counter to resemble a droplet ala/originating
  from \"SPLASH.\" I'm also visualizing \"SPLASH\" and \"DESIGN\" in different colors,
  probably blue (think tropical water) and gray respectively. Other considerations
  are the possibility of lowercase forms for \"e\" and/or \"n\" in DeSIGn, but this
  remains to be seen as it may distract the eye from the central \"HD\" focus.\r\n\r\nSo,
  tell me what your eyes like for width and weight Typophiles...\r\n\r\nAs always,
  I look forward to all of your input, tutelage, humor, criticism, sketches and anything
  else you'd like to throw at the wall.\r\n\r\n -tim"

    some subtle movement, and hopefully get rid of the hole in \"LA\" at the same
    time. Maybe look at the alternate \"A\"s in Avant Garde to get ideas?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi Hrant,\r\n\r\nI agree. There's definitely opportunity to close down the
    \"LA\" kerning, as hinted at in the lighter weights (esp. at smaller sizes) of
    Sansa Condensed. I hadn't thought of it, but I guess the A's counter offers the
    possibility to introduce the droplet concept as well.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean
    by \"subtle\" movement? Perhaps I'll know after inspecting Avant Garde alternates.
    I think I'll have a look at Mark's Proxima Nova alternates as well.\r\n\r\n -t"

    but that's not literal enough. I took a look at Avante Garde and Proxima's \"A\"

  body: "Hi Typos -- I've emailed OurType three times with questions about Sansa and
    they have failed to reply. I'm not too excited about buying a typeface from them
    if they are unable to so much as reply to my mails. Perhaps it's a glitch with
    their Flash interface? \r\n\r\nThis got me to perusing specimens again, and I
    came across an interesting face by Thomas Mettendorf called <a href=\"http://www.garagefonts.com/typespecimens_2.html?sku=GF061008X1P2&charsets=T&start=1\"><strong>Fono</strong></a>
    in the Indie Fonts 2 book.\r\n\r\nI really like the character of this font. I
    think it might work even better than Sansa for my purposes (screen-based logotype
    and headlines/corporate identity. I'm not sure how it would do as a text face,
    but I can always choose another with which to pair it.\r\n\r\nWhat do <em>you</em>
    think of <a href=\"http://www.garagefonts.com/typespecimens_2.html?sku=GF061008X1P2&charsets=T&start=1\"><strong>Fono</strong></a>?
    Is it too funky?"

    you that problem. I like Fono but you might also like Vista from Emigre.

    even if he is on the annual European extended holiday, one shouldn't leave one's
