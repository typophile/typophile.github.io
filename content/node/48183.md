    a full stop instead.\r\n\r\nStill, no excuse for not using it. Throughout the
    site there are a lot of other grammar and punctuation errors that could be nitpicked.

  body: "Yes, I realize the British call it a full-stop, but isn't a little pretentious
    when Americans use British vocabulary? Not quite as bad as affecting an accent,
    but close.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I didn't mean to nitpick this particular person, but
    I've noticed that comma splices are verging on standard British usage and I'm
    curious about it. I read dpreview.com and their writing, while mostly professional,
    is riddled with comma splices. I even see them in BBC articles occasionally.\r\n"

  body: "A freelance editor I know tells me that there is a lot of cost-cutting in
    publishing by neglecting to have proper proof-reading and editing. There also
    seem to be quite a lot of people actually defending things like this as examples
    of language constantly evolving. \r\nI have also heard that schools put less emphasis
    on grammar and punctuation these days, believing it stifles creativity. I do not
    know how true this is and I am not convinced it does. "
