body: "When generating an OpenType font that only contains uppercase letters, is there
  some clever trick to avoid redundant information/data?\r\n\r\n1) If one makes the
  font without glyphs in the lowercase slots, the user will get \"missing glyphs\"
  when typing without Caps Lock on - not good.\r\n\r\n2) If one copies the uppercase
  glyphs to the lowercase slots, one have to take care to make the kerning work between
  the sets - effectively doubling the outline data and quadrupling the kerning data.
  I don't like this redundancy and would prefer to avoid it. But as I use class-kerning
  anyway this is probably the solution I'll end up using...\r\n\r\n3) One could use
  the uppercase glyphs as composites in the lowercase slots, but this may perhaps
  create problems (I don't think I've ever encountered a font with composites in the
  basic ASCII set - so I guess this is not good...). This would still need 4 times
  the kerning pairs, but at least the outline data will not be double.\r\n\r\n4) In
  OpenType one could use glyph substitution to map all lowercase input to the uppercase
  letters. This would still require the lowercase glyphs to be present, but they could
  just be empty. But what OpenType feature should then be used to make this switch?
  - it would have to be always-on...\r\n\r\nSo... have anyone found a clever way to
  make an uppercase-only OpenType font?\r\nWhat is your preferred method?"

  body: 5) You can assign more than one Unicode point to a glyph. The code field for
    "B" would show "0062 0042". I'm not sure if there are any problems inherent in
    the fact that it can have only one glyph name.

  body: "Undurprisingly, I agree with Josh. A few more detailed comments.\r\n\r\n2)
    If you use class kerning, there's zero increase in the amount of kerning data,
    so I don't understand the concern. The \"kerning pairs\" are purely virtual.\r\n\r\n3)
    Composites is a fine idea for OT-TT. For OT-CFF, if the font is built with subroutinization,
    the duplicate glyphs will add next to nothing to the total size, and you don't
    need even need to use composites (though it might help you keep things straight
    during development).\r\n\r\n4) That's a pretty weird choice. And in general, OT
    features should not map from one character to a different one.\r\n\r\n5) You can
    assign more than one Unicode point to a glyph, but this has some unfortunate side
    effects for backtracing Unicode codepoints from glyphs. Given (3), this would
    seem unnecessary.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the extra suggestion and comments. Much appreciated.\r\nAnd if
    not even Adobes own font expert knows of a special clever way to make uppercase-only
    fonts, then probably no-one does. ;)\r\n\r\nAs I thought: I'll make, kern and
    space the uppercase, and then copy them to the lowercase slots before adding the
    diacritics as composites - using class-kerning based on the kerning of the uppercase
    glyphs. This will leave _some_ \"redundant\" data, but is probably the best option
    compatibility- and encoding-wise... Better to make a normal, working font, than
    risk trouble by being \"clever\". :)\r\n\r\nRoger"
