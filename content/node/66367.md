  body: "Bugger; Shoelace is just too easy. And Hrant; I can always just change those
    aglets to telephone or USB. Or power outlet. Or HDMI connection. And I just might.
    In fact I can have an infinite amount of variants just by changing the ends ;\xB7}"

  body: With OT, that is given. My idea is to build a lot of ligaures totally connected,
    and then change in the "endings" and "beginnings".

    a string enters and exits.
