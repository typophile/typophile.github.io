  body: "It looks like the typeface called \"Becker Series\" from the Inland Type
    Foundry of St. Louis in the late 1800's. It is shown in the 'Treasury of Authentic
    Art Nouveau Alphabets' by Ludwig Petzendorfer (Dover Books). Dieter Steffmann
    has digitized many of these blackletter styles, including <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/b/becker.htm\">Becker</a>.\r\n\r\n-
