  information in the past. Thanks to you all. Full Disclosure: I am a graphic designer
  not a type designer so please bear with me.\r\n\r\nI am in the process of establishing
  some branding type standards for a client. Their logotype which I cannot alter uses
  a hand lettered version of what looks like ITC Garamond which I do not like for
  a variety of reasons which have already been discussed in this forum. I have already
  sold them on the idea of using Garamond as their main corporate typeface and we
  are both happy with this direction. I have picked Adobe Garamond which I like because
  it has a good bold weight and has a nice balance between squared off and rounded
  serifs. It also has a clean, streamlined, timeless look to it, less quirky and \"old
  style\" than say Garamond 3. The only problem with Adobe Garamond is that the capital
  G and A are different than in the logotype: The top of the A is rounded in the logotype
  as in ITC Garamond and Garamond 3 rather than the chiseled edge in the Adobe version.
  The G in the Adobe version has a spur vs no spur in the logotype.\r\n\r\nI tried
  using Garamond 3 as it is closer to the logotype but it is not bold enough for my
  needs. It also feels more quirky and old timey, mainly because of the capital A
  and the T.\r\n\r\nI am thinking of altering the A and G in Adobe Garamond to match
  more closely to the logotype.\r\n\r\nSo, my question to the forum is threefold:\r\n\r\n1.
  Are the differences between the A and G too minor to worry about?\r\n2. Would you
  alter the typeface? If so, what software would you recommend? (should be very basic
  and easy to learn)\r\n3. Are there other typefaces out there that may work? (A and
  G like Garamond 3 but a bolder weight.)\r\n\r\nSorry for the overly long post. I
  look forward to your insight and feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I dislike when things are similar but have inconstant structures or details.  \r\n\r\n2.
    You're probably better off hiring a professional type designer since this is for
    a client's corporate typeface. \r\n\r\n3. Adobe Garamond is the nicest digital
    Garamond in my opinion. "

    want to do so; at best have a type designer design a custom face with those distinctions,but
    build it from scratch. Otherwise, you'd be stealing someone's work. \r\nIf you
    have the budget for it, go for it. If not, don't.\r\n\r\nHowever, altering the
    font and using it for commercial use like that is illegal. Doing it for a logotype
    is not quite as punishable, but if you are going to be using it as a full corporate
    face, you are going to be breaking the EULA of the font. Especially, if you are
    recreating it as a font and dispersing it along the company.\r\n\r\n"

    here a few times (http://www.typophile.com/node/16180, http://typophile.com/node/31280).
    Best bet again is to contact the foundry directly, or talk to a reputable type
    designer. '

  body: "I don\u2019t think that logo and corporate typeface must use the same font.
    If you can\u2019t change the logo it\u2019s ok, but changing Adobe Garamond is
    not a good idea either. Trying to match it with ITC Garamond is almost impossible,
    since they are based on different models (first by Garamond, the second a loose
    interpretation of Jannon\u2019s work). In addition, you say it is a hand lettered
    version, so it\u2019s not really ITC Garamond anyway. I\u2019d accept they are
    two separate things and go for Adobe Garamond as it is. Though a bit overused,
    it is one of my favorite designs.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
