  body: It's very nerdy but pretty easy once you figure out the tables. I made a small
    osx app that generates afdko commands, it makes the nerdy stuff a little easier,
    especially if you have a number of files to deal with. If you're interested email
    me and I'll send it to you (hello at okaytype .com)

    somewhat less \u2018nerdy\u2019. A <em>Light</em> version can be <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/english/demo.html\">downloaded

    is even not more comfortable for paragraph\u2019s purposes. OTMaster is an excellent
    tool. But I think, that it is too expensive, especially, if you don\u2019t need
    most of its features. Really \u2013 255 Euro (+ 19% in Germany) \u2013 that is
    a moon price. Elitary in my opinion."

    might be wrong here but I also saw it as a complete replacement system for FLS

    same about the DTL fonts, wouldn\u2019t you? No doubt, that a font like DTL Fleischmann
    is excellent, but in my opinion fonts like Feliciano\u2019s Merlo or Santos\u2019
    Capsa or Kobayashi\u2019s Clifford are on a comparable quality level, if not on
    the same one. However, you are obviously successful with your calculations.\r\n\r\nI
    am primary interested in a decompiler/compiler, that comments the XML tags and
    that checks the consistency. And it should be possible to personalize both, the
    consistency check and the comments. The naming system, that Adobe uses, violates
    the OT specification, but it works. So the consistency check reports errors, as
    far as I remember. In this context I would like to know, how fast you can update
    the OTMaster, when Adobe updates the AFDKO and how much updates/upgrades of the
    OTMaster will cost.\r\n\r\nI would be interested in a light version (not the test
    version) without the glyph editor. I assume, that it would be easy to remove it.
    Can you imagine to provide such a version for less money?"

    at the man years put into the production of DTL Fleischmann, the pricing of the
    fonts is realistic. After an intensive study a large range of photographs were
    taken (ordered) of historical Fleischmann material and enlargements were made.
    Subsequently new drawings of <strong>all</strong> characters were made by hand.
    These were enlarged and served as the basis for the working drawings, which were
    all marked and manually digitized in the IKARUS format. The generated Bezier data
    was checked against the IK data for conversion errors and all contours were \u2018cleaned\u2019,
    i.e., unnecessary contour points were removed.\r\nThis production method was chosen
    to preserve the most tiny details in the design and it paid out when one looks
    at the quality of the final digital results.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fleischm_prod_1_3990.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fleischm_prod_2_5119.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fleischm_prod_3_3863.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fleischm_prod_4_3948.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fleischm_prod_5_3432.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fleischm_prod_6_5940.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fleischm_prod_7_6108.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fleischm_prod_8_4866.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fleischm_prod_9_4551.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<em>The
    naming system, that Adobe uses, violates the OT specification, but it works. So
    the consistency check reports errors, as far as I remember.</em>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIt
    is unclear to me what you mean; the <em>Consistency Checker</em> in DTL OTMaster
    checks the naming against the OT specs, it even summarizes the specs.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<em>how
    fast you can update the OTMaster, when Adobe updates the AFDKO</em>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nOTM
    is used internally at URW++ and DTL for the daily production. When a new version
    of the AFDKO becomes available, it is built in almost immediately.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<em>I
    would be interested in a light version (not the test version) without the glyph
    editor. I assume, that it would be easy to remove it. Can you imagine to provide
    such a version for less money?</em>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNope, tailor made versions are
    actually more expensive.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe simple thing with pricing is, that if
    one considers a product to be too expensive, one should not buy it.\r\n"

    with regard to the invested man years. I have read the PDF about the history and
    the production process of Fleischmann; so I knew, that a long time was invested.
    It was not just a chance, that I picked out Fleischmann, because for me it is
    a reference like the loudspeakers of Spendor. But in this context I would like
    to know, how much you would like to have for Merlo, Rongel, Capsa or Clifford,
    if these fonts came from DTL. I only would like to know it. But an answer would
    be too indiscrete; so it is not a question.\r\n\r\nThe shots are really great.
    Thank you!\r\n\r\nDo you think, that Fleischmann can be displayed adequate on
    (actual) ebook devices?"

    Dutch Type Library is not a retailer of fonts as such, but a font (-software)
    producing and publishing company. More than twenty years ago I set up a font (production)
    program for DTL, which expresses my personal ideas about type and typography,
    and in which both high quality historical and newly to design typefaces got a
    place. The historical typefaces had and have to cover the different style periods
    and all typefaces should not overlap but support each other. This means for instance
    that the different contrast sorts and contrast variants are covered. Normally
    type designers are invited to make a certain typeface that fits the program, like
    Erhard Kaiser was in 1992 for DTL Fleischmann.\r\n\r\nThe complete DTL library
    will contain not more than roughly 25 typefaces at the end and each typeface will
    at least support Cyrillic and Greek besides Latin then.\r\n\r\n"
