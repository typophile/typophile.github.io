  body: I would recommend getting FontLab &#40;or its less expensive sibling, TypeTool
    if you are on a tight budget--plus it has an upgrade path to FontLab&#41; and
    learning to use the drawing tools in these programs. It is different than using
    Illustrator&#39;s drawing tools, but similar enough that it is not hard to figure
    out. In the long run you will be better off working this way rather than in a
    separate program like Illustrator in terms of speed and efficiency. <BR> <BR>It
    is quite possible to draw a font in Illustrator and then transfer the artwork
    to FontLab. Many type designers work this way &#40;I used to&#41;. There is even
    a companion program for FontLab called ScanFont that can very quickly get art
    from Illustrator to FontLab without a lot of copying and pasting or import/export
    business. However, there are some drawbacks to working this way, mainly to do
    with rounding errors. Font outlines typically inhabit a space about 1000 units
    tall and points can only be placed on whole unit coordinates. A drawing program
    like Illustrator has practicaly unlimited space in which to draw and practically
    unlimited precision in placing points. It doesn&#39;t seem like a big deal until
    you start importing artwork into a font editor and realise the stems are not all
    quite the same width and small features you sweated over are not quite how you
    drew them. <BR> <BR>There are also ways of going from drawings on paper to FontLab
    via a scanner. Again, ScanFont makes this process easy but you can also import
    the scans into FontLab yourself. Once they are in FontLab, you can trace them
    just as you would in Illustrator. Alternatively, ScanFont or FontLab can auto-trace
    it for you, but I would not recommend this route unless you are not picky about
    the results. It can also be a good preliminary step before redrawing the character
    shapes yourself. <BR> <BR>You may be tempted to use Macromedia Fontographer, but
    this program is seriously out of date &#40;it hasn&#39;t had an update since 1996!&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>There are some other capable programs out there for making fonts, but
    I don&#39;t know a lot about them. FontLab and Fontographer are the only ones
    I&#39;ve spent a lot of time with.

  body: In that case, I would also recommend Leslie Cabarga&#39;s <i>Learn FontLab
    Fast</i> book. FontLab can be a bit daunting at first and Leslie&#39;s book will
    help a lot. I wish it had been around a few years ago when I first tried to use
    FontLab.
