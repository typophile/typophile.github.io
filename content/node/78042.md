body: "I've been seeing a few similar styled typefaces lately. They seem to share
  a similar aesthetic of the single story 'a' and usually have a slight awkward quality
  to them. Do you think most of these are made by the designers or are there typefaces
  like this out there?\r\n\r\nA few I know that are similar are [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/neuzeit-grotesk/|Neuzeit
  Grotesk]], [[http://fonts.gestalten.com/index.php/catalog/product/view/id/3559|Planeta]],
  of course [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/|Futura]]\r\n\r\nI really like
  the way the 'e' terminal is cut almost awkardly short in the top example."

    makes sense."

  body: Those are great. I really like the specimen you posted Jens. Gives some helpful
    insight into creating my own version at some point. Seems most of these typefaces
    have a German origin.
