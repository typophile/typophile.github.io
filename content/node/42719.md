body: "I am developing a logo for a project called virgo (lowercase). The font I have
  selected is Ronda EF regular. I have scowered the web for a logic to kerning and
  tracking for logo design. I am stuck at the point at which I have customized the
  logo from Ronda EF regular by thickening the stoke and modifying some letters. Now
  I need to properly space and kern the letters but I don't know how (not optical
  kerning). In my defense I have purchased a book on designing type, and have spent
  hours digging through google, but the results don't give me what I need.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone recommend a professional kerning/tracking service provider? I am a novice
  when it comes to the above mentioned. \r\n\r\nAny logic or assistance would be greatly
  appreciated as well.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nMarvin"

    attempt. I don't know what anyone can say without seeing what you've done thus
    far.

  body: "If we are only speaking of a few letters for the logo - why not outline them
    in Illustrator and then by hand place them where you want them to be. Save the
    file, archive it and now you have a logo that will always be the same and that
    you know your other programs can not match the arrangement of the letters. BTW
    - If you don't have Illustrator, perhaps you have Photoshop? You can set each
    letter on an individual layer and move them/overlap them, whatever - till you
    get what you are looking for.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, what programs are you working
    from? Most of us would be working in QuarkXPress or InDesign. But if you are on
    an IBM or IBM compatible working with some Microsoft program - I understand it
    is most cruel to the fonts out there... and kerning/letterspacing falls to the
    wayside.\r\n\r\nGood luck with your project. Hope it turns out well and is appreciated
    by all."
