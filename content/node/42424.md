body: "Last Thursday I got confirmation that my proposals for a fashion webretailer
  were accepted and a budget cleared \u2014 so it appears that I am back in business:
  my first client!\r\n\r\nAfter two years of (professional) inactivity it\u2019s a
  strange feeling to be back in the loop again. But also exciting \u2014 I get to
  do what I enjoy.\r\n\r\nThis gig is going to be an ongoing project, with 6 or 7
  items to be produced every month. All of them in digital form. For the moment I
  am going to use Process Type\u2019s <strong>Locator</strong> as the main typeface.
  I bought that to use in my own (very limited) identity, but it\u2019s very fitting
  for upscale woman\u2019s fashion, I think. But I am still on the lookout for a sans
  with an open character and \u2014 very important! \u2014 a thin and very thin Light
  style.\r\n\r\nI will probably post some stuff here in a month or two."
