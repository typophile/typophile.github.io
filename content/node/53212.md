body: "Type designers, which of these statements most closely matches your practice
  of spacing ligatures (fi, for example)?\r\n\r\n1) I give the same or about the same
  space between ligated letters as I would between their unligated forms: evenness
  of color demands that consistency. Thus, for example, the fi ligature is even in
  width with the unligated letters fi.\r\n\r\n2) Ligatures \"tie\" letters together:
  I always and rather consistently tighten the internal space of ligatures relative
  to the space between their unligated forms. The fi ligature is predictably narrower
  than the unligated letters fi.\r\n\r\n3) The space between ligated letters is an
  internal counter with its own design demands: there is no special relation between
  it and the space between those letters' unligated forms. The fi ligature bears no
  consistent relation in width to the unligated letters fi."

  body: "None of the above. Evenness of colour seldom demand consistency: it usually
    demands careful inconsistency. Ligatures, because of their connections, are more
    complicated and dense shapes than unconnected letters. Therefore, it is usually
    necessary to make them a tad more open and looser than unligated letters, otherwise
    they form dark patches on the page.\r\n\r\nSo, a little bit of 1 and a little
    bit of 3."

  body: "I try to optimize for \"filling\" and \"office\".\r\n\r\nIn \"filling\",
    I aim to make the space between \"f\" and \"i\" slightly larger than between \"i\"
    and \"l\" &c., to avoid the picket fence.\r\nHowever, the verticals should not
    be so far apart that \"ffi\" becomes too open. I also try to get the verticals
    in \"ffi\" and \"ffl\" &c. evenly spaced, which may seem contradictory to the
    anti-fence aesthetic, but what the heck, affiliate.\r\n\r\nMy practice these days
    is to design ligatures out of typefaces. In the first place, despite the wonders
    of the age, there are still many font uses where ligatures are not supported.
    \ \r\n\r\nWith OpenType support, I think the best way to deal with awkward glyph
    combinations (many involving accents) is with contextually nuanced alternate forms
    of f that are substituted by the Ligature feature (by default), rather than pre-made
    composite glyphs.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the \"f\" ligatures have a pedigree and cachet
    in old style text faces, but as a design solution for multi-lingual fonts in today's
    plethora of genres, sizes, and output devices, they are inappropriate."

  body: "My idea on this is to always look at the ligatures in long words when spacing
    them. Something that looks really bad in my opinion is when they are to tight,
    so you really \"see\" them as ligatures and not as a part of a word, but I agree
    they are tricky to space.\r\n\r\nI think it also has something to do with how
    the original \"f\" is looking, in a way."

  body: It's probably a bad idea to create any sort of reflex about this because each
    design will be different. Some designs are sort of picket fence oriented anyway.
    Some designs are eclectic and almost need a very distinct approach to the ligatures.
    But what Nick said about Ligatures being less than ideal as optical solutions
    and for me particulatly when setting a long running text strikes me as mostly
    right. Where generalizations come in, what John said about "careful inconsistency"
    seems especially right.
