  for some criticism. I'm still working on kerning and special glyphs as well as different
  weights. I'm hoping to maybe get this to market in a few years (wishful thinking,
  I know). It's called Bhambu. It's made for body text and I think it's pretty easy
  on the eyes even at smaller sizes (9-11pt). Let me know what you guys think. \r\n\r\nThanks,
  \r\n\r\nJamie"

  body: "The large \"r\" in the alphabet to the left looks normal, but all the \"r\"s
    in the sample text have the top left serif pulled down below the x-height. What's
    going on with that? The version used in the sample text is too distracting and
    looks bad in my opinion.\r\n\r\nOther comments:\r\nI like the shape of the c.
    The t looks a little too narrow, and the crossbar seems to be placed below the
    x-height: this looks weird to me in the word \"taciti\" and some other contexts.
    In the sample text (but not in the large alphabet) the bottom bowl of the g looks
    squished; I can't decide if I like it or not."
