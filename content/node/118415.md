  and it tracks back to Billabong's website, but does not appear on it. It is more
  than likely a custom font. But, I am looking for something similar, not necessarily
  this particular font that is free for commercial use.  I would like to use it as
  the header for my blog.\r\n\r\nAny ideas about this font or similar one would be
  greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lucea
