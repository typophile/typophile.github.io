  friend, you can hardly call it a website. Its just one page really. \r\n\r\nThis
  is what it looks like right now: http://img.skitch.com/20100219-tpjdn2re3sbmsnps8qn46cph5w.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  am pretty satisfied with it already though I dont really know what I am doing HTML
  wise (nor typograhphy wise haha).\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate if some of you could share
  their knowledge and help me to further improve the design. Which web font for instance
  do you think works the best with Gotham Bold?\r\n\r\nThanks. Jake.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks for mentioning my article, Penn, but I kinda abandoned it when @font-face
    broke through. It does still have some relevance though.

  body: Yeah, I saw that it had been posted a while ago, but it still looked like
    it had good stuff in it. I especially liked how the charts were set up. Even with
    @font-face gaining momentum, font stacks are still relevant for accessibility
    to IE users which sadly make up the majority.

  body: 'There are still plenty of reasons to not use @font-face in a lot of cases,
    so I''d say font stacks are still quite relevant. Good to have both. '
