  body: Where did you get this sample? First thought was DF Calligraphic Ornaments,
    but then I realized that it is missing the finer strokes/details. Poetica?

  body: "No. Not really. Just lucky to have had a bit of a Poetica addiction once
    upon a time to the point of printing out samples and hanging it on my wall. I
    bow before true MTID (Masters of Type Identification) such as Mike, Mark, Yves
    and Karl. I was being incredibly sarcastic. Thanks guys. \r\n\r\n:^)"
