  I have been looking for a text font that would be consistent with his era, but haven't
  found much.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nVeronique"

  body: "Following the wane of Jenson, Aldus, Griffo, et al., at the end of the 1500s,
    I don\u2019t think you find many standout, uniquely Italian types until the rise
    of Bodoni in the late 1700s.\r\n\r\nI believe much Italian printing of the 1600s\u2013early
    1700s was more or less following French fashion, using types along the lines of
    those cut by Granjon and Le B\xE9. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, and if you weren\u2019t
    hung up on being strictly historical, Matthew Carter\u2019s <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-galliard/\">ITC
    Galliard</a> is an anthology of Granjon\u2019s style and tends to bring out the
    proto-Baroque characteristics.\r\n\r\nAlternately, Mikl\xF3s Kis (Hungarian, trained
    in the Netherlands) cut some types for the Grand Duke of Florence, ca. 1690s.
    Various <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/Janson/fonts/\">Janson</a> typefaces
    are based on his work. Again, not stereotypically Italian, but not too far off
    the mark historically (but maybe too far south of Vivaldi).\r\n\r\nAnd again,
    if you\u2019re not too hung up on authenticity, Cyrus Highsmith\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/ZocaloText/\">Z\xF3calo</a>
    series takes much inspiration from the types of Kis. And, filtered through Highsmith\u2019s
    unique sensibility, dial up the Baroque quality a notch or two. Could be fun in
    a children\u2019s book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
