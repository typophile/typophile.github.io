body: "Hello everyone, \r\n\r\nI'm putting together PowerPoint templates (yeah, I
  know...) for two classes: Roman History and Greek History. I'm not the one teaching
  these classes, which by the way are at college level, and I don't have any of the
  material so I can't let the content inform the design.\r\n\r\nAt this beginning
  stage of the project, I'm looking for inspiration. Do you have any samples of well
  designed books/magazines on Roman/Greek art? \r\n\r\nAnd to make this related to
  typography, any suggestions regarding typefaces? For the titles I might try to achieve
  an inscribed letters effect (if I go with a rock surface background, and I can pull
  it off in PPT).\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, I might be posting here screenshots of
  the work in progress over the next two weeks. \r\n\r\nThanks for your help. "

    version is available digitally.\r\n\r\nLithos is a good Greek face.\r\nPaul Shaw's
    Pontif is an alternative to the ubiquitous Trajan."

    [[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/goudy-forum-pro.aspx|Gaudy Forum]] from Ascender.\r\n\r\nI'm
    currently researching Roman and Greek ornamental motifs. I need to befriend an
    art historian :)"

    you can use, if only as inspiration.
