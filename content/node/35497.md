  body: "Thank you for your replies. :-)\r\n\r\nIndeed, that \"A\" had been puzzling
    me; and so it isn't an \"A\", after all... :-P (The missing counters, yes, I was
    assuming those had probably been customisedly filled, yes.)\r\n\r\nOnly wondering
    then, would there be any website you could please refer me to, where I could view
    the charmap of the Adobe Sans Substitution Font? The most I could find was <a
    href=http://www.identifont.com/find?font=adobe+sans&q=Go>@ Identifont</a>; would
    this be the font you mean?... Then again, though, that would have to be a lot
    more \"boldened\"... Is there as well a bold version of this Adobe Sans Substitution
    Font, and anywhere I could view it?... Much appreciated for any further help.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I'm adding the rest of the sample including those few other characters available,
    if useful at all:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/afa2_3866.JPG]"

  body: "Sorry about my late reply; I lost track of this thread.\r\n\r\nThe Adobe
    Sans Substitution Font cannot be used as such. It is an automatic replacement
    by the now defunct Adobe Type Manager Deluxe Professional \xDCberversion Whatever
    when the intended font is absent on the computer used to output a file. In short,
    it shows up when the correct font is not there. So it was never intended to be
    used on purpose. You can't purchase it nor can you specify it in your font menu."

  body: "Hmm, I see, I see... Thank you so much, Yves Peters, for all further enlightenment.
    :-)\r\n\r\nHmm, the one thing that still has me wondering is really those \"customised\"
    letters, (the ones with missing counters and especially the \"A\")... Doesn't
    it make it odd, then, that every other letter is supposed to have been \"replaced\"
    by the Adobe Sans Substitution Font, and yet those customised letters still show,
    precisely, customised, (this assuming then that the original font was missing,
    whether deliberately or not)?... Or do the Adobe Substitution Fonts actually \"work\"
    in a \"letter-by-letter basis\"?... Meaning then, in this case, that only the
    non-costumised letters had been replaced, would that eventually be the case?...
    (Or does this what I say not even have any logic at all? o_O Again, I hope you
    understand my doubt, and also again, please pardon my ignorance. :-S)\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I'm so sorry to repeat this question, but I was only wondering; would the Adobe
    Sans found at Identifont be the same as the Adobe Sans Substitution Font which
    you referred, yes?... Or?...\r\n\r\nOnce again, thank you so much, for your kind
    help and patience. :-)"
