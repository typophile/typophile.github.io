<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Anyone inspired by Typecon2007 to start a new typeface? There was so much on display to take in and enjoy.
Perhaps after seeing the Veer presentation, you are inspired to do a massive display script project ALA [[Alejandro Paul]]? Or was it the next gen text faces coming out of Mexico that really rocked your boat?
I do know one thing, for some reason I don't think I'm too interested in doing a "grunge" typeface anytime soon...
After speaking with [[Eben Sorkin]], [[Nick Shinn]], [[Kent Lew]] and others, I finally decided to sit down last night to start fleshing out the drawings I've had about an upright semi-italic text face I've been doodling about for the past two years.
What's your inspiration and/or new project?</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I combined my love of type and Boeing projects to start on a new slanted, rounded sans face called Skyliner, which I drew a big chunk of on the plane, and I’ve already started building it in TypeTool. I’ve also been inspired to selling my extra iPod (they’re giving them away with laptops again) and my Intuos 3 (I never use it) so I can buy FontLab. And of course talking to everyone—especially Nick and Delve—gave me food for thought regarding my thesis.
But what was really inspiring was coming back to town and finding out that my awful type professor quit and been replaced by one of my favorite professors. I have quite literally been dreaming about that happening, so these events coinciding with Typecon is so awesome that I’m tempted to find religion.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The amount of grunge/rockband poster stuff on the program was a bit excessive for me. I was really zzzzzz-ing and bailing on that stuff. The Dog duo was a bit full of themselves.
On the other hand, the wonderful Mayan history and Mexican typography was inspiring though. Bill Hill was a fabulous presenter and Spyros Zevalakis gave a passionate presentation on his Greek type and signage.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I have to admit I thought the Modern Dog stuff was fun, but it seemed more like graphic design than typography, if that makes any sense?
I was really impressed with the variety of work coming out of Mexico, and as always at the sheer number of up and coming type designers out there. It's a really exciting time to be involved with type, as the tools and formats have really opened up a seemingly endless world of possibility to a wide range of people....
Cheers,
T</div>

<div class=commentbody>My thumb was down for Modern Dog. To me they came across as snide and not really interested in connecting with or relating to their specialized audience. Is the keynote a portfolio review or job application? Too often keynote speakers have no ideas or message to share with their audience. I thought Tim Girvin, who did essentally the same thing, connected with us and tailored his presentation to the audience better than Modern Dog. He actually likes type, actually does lettering.

There were too many different presentations on grunge typography, honestly. First the Modern Dog, then Pete McCracken, then Art Chantry, then that annoying PBS guy, THEN a panel with the three worst of the bunch.
I could have lived with just Art Chantry because he was talking about type and his approach to type. The others were regaling us in how <em>cool</em> they were and had attitudes that didn't match with the rest of the conference. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I wasn't inspired to create a typeface, but TypeCon did inspire me to do a completely typographic poster for my little theatre company's next show:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sleepy_3600.jpg]
In general, the conference -- as it did the last time I went -- made me recommit not only to solid typography throughout my graphic design work but also to just have fun with type.
(I was also inspired -- by the TC materials as well as by some of the rock and theatre posters that were shown -- to get away from full-color printing in favor of how I used to do things, one- or two-color on great paper. Now the hard part is affording it!)</div>

Michael Strassburger (to the voice in the darkness who won Modern Dog's type id contest twice and then corrected an erroneous id by someone else): "Wow, you're a super type geek!"
Marc (the aforementioned voice in the darkness): "Um, that's why I'm here...?"
