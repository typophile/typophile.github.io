  body: "Edda Solid or Edda Black (I see both names used). \r\n\r\nSeems to be a Dover
    font, part of their Art Nouveau collection. I don't know if you can buy it individually
    and can't find a showing so far."

  body: Yeah, I couldn't find one. I have this font, and if it is truly not available
    commercially I'm happy to send it to you. But I don't know how that will go over
    with this board...

  body: "Yes. I have the complete set. \r\n\r\n$11.53 for the book and 24 fonts is
    not bad... plus no licensing issues. I guess if it's copyright free I could also
    just email it to Evan, no? "

  body: That's an interesting question, and I really wouldn't know about that. Anybody
    else knows more? Maybe Tiff, our EULA princess?

    fun with those fonts. But some are pretty silly."
