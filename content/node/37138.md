body: We have no internet connection at the <em>SOTA/Typophile House of Debauchery
  and Mayhem,</em> plus it is extremely dodgy here in Brighton -- I can't send e-mails
  and I can't even connect to the <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/">Unzipped</a> CMS,
  so that's why there are no new posts for now. Normal service will resume on Monday
  when I'm back.

  body: I found an old blog string re the font Basilea. I commented there and know
    of the font but still can'tfind aMac Postscript version anywhere. I can make one
    in Fontographer but am concerned about licensing issues, etc. Did you ever locate
    a digital version of Basilea? Thanks for any help. RK
