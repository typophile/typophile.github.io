  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This blogger (<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/08/17/linux-achilles-heel-fonts/">http://scobleizer.com/2006/08/17/linux-achilles-heel-fonts/</a>) says that what keeps him from using Linux is &ldquo;readability, fonts, and aesthetics.&rdquo; That is, he won&rsquo;t use Linux because the fonts are so bad. He goes on to say that Microsoft and Apple are winning the operating system wars because type designers (he specifically mentions Matthew Carter) don&rsquo;t work for free.</p>
<p>Then, a columnist at ZDNet picked up on this topic (<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=70)">http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=70)</a>. He says that Windows fonts are better than Mac fonts are better than Linux fonts are better than personal electronics fonts (cell phones, MP3 players, etc.), and that Linux could pick up users by improving its fonts. He says readability and quality fonts are important to users who spend a lot of time on their computers, and that &ldquo;bigger, clearer icons and better fonts&rdquo; are reason enough for him to upgrade to Windows Vista (I assume he means the Aero user interface).</p>
<p>So it looks like computer geeks sometimes notice fonts and think about readability (whatever that means to them), but does anybody here think fonts do or could influence the general user population in their choice of OS, or make them switch from one OS to another?</p>

<p>Even if occasionally their advice is circumvented or ignored certain standards can be maintained, even when budget is tight.</p>
<p>I could be wrong but I don’t think Sony or Motorola have font teams, and I think that goes a long way to explain the quality of the type used on their products.</p>
<p>Edit: I&rsquo;ve said this before, but what Linux really needs is a font dictator, a NickNeg style figurehead who can lay down the law with respect to font and font rendering quality, and can put corporations, governments and other supporters through the mangle to extract funds to pay real type designers and engineers to do the hard work.</p>

I think that for most users, the 100+ DPI fonts are fine, although if all those nerds coding Photoshop/Illustrator replacements don&rsquo;t get Opentype and anti-aliased rendering working well under X their efforts will be mostly wasted.</p>
<p>The real problem with Linux is that if you aren&rsquo;t a *nix programmer and you want to do more than surf the web and edit OpenOffice documents, the software available for Linux pretty much sucks. It also doesn&rsquo;t help that if you want to use Linux you eventually have to deal with Stallmanism and free software zealots. Some of those people are completely crazy–which is why I personally ditched Linux for *BSD servers and Mac OS on the desktop.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t know what the Vista fonts look like, and since my Windows box has now been relegated to serving as nothing more than a standalone torrent client, I&rsquo;ll probably never see them. Somehow I doubt that I&rsquo;m missing much; Microsoft&rsquo;s attempts to emulate Apple&rsquo;s eye candy have always been pretty ham-handed.</p>

<p>Apple’s eye candy</p>

<p>With the exception of Zapfino, I think Apple has always had a great track-record of providing high-quality work-horse fonts, starting with the original custom work and more recently the licensed fonts. To claim these are &lsquo;eye candy&rsquo; seems out of order - especially strange to make this claim on typophile rather than a Linux fan-boy site.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It seems to me that there are two separate issues here. The first is improving the font rendering system in various distributions of Linux, Gnome, KDE, etc. Fixing this needs the attention of one or more Linux developers with font expertise. I could speculate on why this has been a low- or non-priority, but I really don&rsquo;t know. Fonts are certainly recognized as a problem in Linux &ndash; just google &ldquo;linux fonts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(Later edit: I am aware of things like Xft, FreeType, and FontConfig, but it&rsquo;s not clear that these solve the issue 100%. The problem relates to Apple patents on hinting and anti-aliasing, aka the &ldquo;byte code interpreter.&rdquo; Of course the BCI has been reverse engineered, but the result isn&rsquo;t legal in various countries.)</p>
<p>The second issue is whether the typographic community is comfortable making fonts available under the free/libre/open software concept (not to be confused with freeware/gratis). Since I enjoy having my head attached to my shoulders, I&rsquo;m not going to pursue this issue any further, except to note that it has been discussed here to some extent:</p>
<p><a href="http://typophile.com/node/16620">http://typophile.com/node/16620</a>

<a href="http://typophile.com/node/14914">http://typophile.com/node/14914</a></p>
<p>I also seem to recall an effort to start a typographic intellectual property commons (not SIL, I think) but I can&rsquo;t find a reference to it now when I need it.</p>

<p>Thinking about Apple holding the patents on TrueType hinting but not using them, in conjunction with despotype, reminded me of Apple&rsquo;s 1984/Big Brother commercial. Which was ironic because it was IBM that had the cheap, open, uncontrolled system that anybody could build, while Apple had the expensive, closed system that they kept under iron control. Still do, too.</p>

<p>sii, I was thinking more about the GPL and the requirement to make source code available and freely modifiable and extendable. Is anybody distributing their fonts under the GPL or copyleft? That&rsquo;s fundamentally different from giving fonts away as freeware (i.e., gratis), or donating them (that is, granting an unlimited perpetual license, with or without receiving a license fee) to LaTex or Gnome or whatever. Open/libre software, the GPL, and copyleft seem to me to be somewhat at odds with the strong intellectual property ethos I see in the font industry &ndash; which I fully agree with, BTW.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I usually do more lurking around here than posting, but since this topic has come up, I have to ask this question: what do you think makes font display good or bad on a computer system?  I read stories like the blog linked above, and often there aren&rsquo;t enough specifics given beyond the statement that fonts are &ldquo;terrible&rdquo; on one system or another.</p>
<p>Is it really that people just have different tastes?  For example, I find the antialiasing in Linux, even without support for the bytecode interpreter, to be much easier on my eyes than anything from a Windows box.  I don&rsquo;t like the non-anti-aliased look for some fonts that presumably have good hinting under Windows, and I don&rsquo;t like the various anti-aliasing options that are available under Windows. I haven&rsquo;t found a setting that doesn&rsquo;t make some parts of the stems of characters almost disappear entirely. That problem, to me, is much worse than anything I&rsquo;ve seen in Linux. On the other hand, my experience with Linux is that the anti-aliasing produces (on the whole&ndash;there are some exceptions) very readable text that doesn&rsquo;t ever disappear from over-blurring.</p>
<p>I found once an article with the opposite opinion, and it finally turned out that that author viewed any text that wasn&rsquo;t crisp black-on-white with no anti-aliasing as being unreadable.</p>
<p>So, to sum up, I&rsquo;d be very interested in the precise details of font rendering that others feel makes or breaks a system. Is there any concensus, or is it really personal preference?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As regards Mac OSX vs Windows vs Windows+ClearType, there were screenshots in an older thread.</p>
<p>As regards &ldquo;objectively&rdquo;, well. [Comparing Simon Daniels' and Scott Thatcher&rsquo;s posts makes it pretty clear that]* The standards by which font rasterization is judged to be &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; can be very different.
Microsoft&rsquo;s position is that a font is well rasterized if it has high black/white contrast and as little grayscaling as possible. (I exaggerate a bit.) Scott Thatcher&rsquo;s, Nick Shinn&rsquo;s (and my) position is that OSX&rsquo;s &ldquo;blurry&rdquo; grayscaling is highly readable too &ndash; and as Nick indicated, future higher resolution screens will contribute to make this kind of grayscaling look better than on cheap low-res screens. It is two contradicting philosophies: Counting Pixels vs Scanning Word Images. (Again, exaggerating a bit.) Only then, other factors come into play: MS requires hinting, Apple doesn&rsquo;t, and I think Adobe CS app&rsquo;s do well without hinting too.
From a font production side the question arises: Is it worth the extra efforts for a <cite>slightly</cite> better look on low-res screens? And from a user&rsquo;s side: Which OS serves me better &ndash; one that allows for a handful of <cite>very</cite> well rendered fonts (very well means: with high contrast, measured by MS' standards), or one that renders <cite>all</cite> fonts well (which means: they look a bit &ldquo;blurry&rdquo; from MS' point of view)?
The much-cited &ldquo;blurriness&rdquo; is exactly the merit of grayscaling, for it takes into account that one scans word images, that screen resolutions have become a bit higher so you don&rsquo;t have to, and cannot, count pixels any more. Amusingly, Windows' rasterizer(s) trained people to consider a font to look good if it looks like a black/white pixel font. But I think former Mac OS9 users very well understood the improvement that ATM finally offered by introducing grayscaling; suddenly you could <cite>read</cite> text that you could only guess at before, say, when typesetting italics, and one could even go down with PPEM sizes. The funny thing however is that since grayscaling, people tend to use PPEM sizes much smaller than they could use when type was rasterized in black/white, and of course that leads to unreadable results again &hellip;
I am convinced that it is rasterizers that have to be intelligent, not fonts. At least from the distance it is telling that it was Apple who (as co-inventor of TT) decided to forget about hints in their systems' rasterizer.</p>

<p>Whoa, can you go back and re-read my posts? There was nothing negative about my explanation of Apple&rsquo;s approach in OSX. Why are you putting words into my mouth? I didn&rsquo;t say Apple&rsquo;s approach was bad or that I prefer crisp type to blurry type. In fact I only wrote about the Apple rendering philosophy and the reaction from hard-core TrueType purists within Apple. I didn&rsquo;t even mention Microsoft&rsquo;s approach.</p>

<p>Do you think going back to pixel fonts (whether b/w or grayscaled) is a solution? The idea of pixel fonts always reminds me of my first attempt at digital fonts on my Atari 1040ST with Signum!2 or Signum!3; I also remember my delight when I got to know that there were font formats that used outlines which were converted to pixel images on demand.  :)
Of course pixel fonts can be a good thing for some handheld devices.</p>

<p>First, I think Apple&rsquo;s method is ok, and the higher the resolution of the screen, the better are the results.
But my point was, maybe it&rsquo;s possible to improve rasterizers a bit so they don&rsquo;t require hints on font level? (Say, if required for small PPEM sizes, fonts could be autohinted by the rasterizer before being rasterized.)</p>

<p>The work-around to Apple&rsquo;s patent on the bytecode interpreter by the Freetype people was to create an auto-hinter that does what you describe. The natural question is &ldquo;How well does it work,&rdquo; and that I can&rsquo;t answer.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clearly not &ldquo;a bit&rdquo;.
This was the promise of Postscript, and the non-delivery of this promise is the main reason the introduction of Truetype was justified. We still don&rsquo;t have a really good &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; renderer. Yes, it seems it would be possible to make one; but it also seems it&rsquo;s extremely difficult = would cost more money to develop than this field has at its -altruistic- disposal.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it from quite that direction before.  Although I&rsquo;ve recently become fond of Bitstream Vera for text terminals and system interface use in Linux, I have always prefered bitmapped fonts for coding and other purposes where the display on screen was the end goal.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve never appreciated the black-and-white bitmapped look of fonts like Times New Roman or Garamond in something like Microsoft Word because I&rsquo;ve never felt that the crisp, pixelated look matches what I&rsquo;ll see on the final printed page.</p>
<p>On another note, does anyone here know whether Windows applies hints before it applies antialiasing?  If the stem width is hinted into one pixel width before it&rsquo;s anti-aliased, it might explain why some stems seem to me to almost entirely disappear after antialiasing.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t get get past this either, or more specificaally, the conversion of all my databases into open source applications might just kill me. But, just for kicks, what would be the specification of a Linutype™ cores set?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking about Apple holding the patents on TrueType hinting but not using them&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think this is fair, but inaccurate : I believe Apple <strong>does</strong> use hints below the user-defined anti-aliasing switch in the appearance preferences.  In addition, Apple only holds patents on 2.5 instructions; the DeltaP instruction, and the Set Projection Vector To Line / Set Freedom Vector To Line combo. All the rest are prior art or something. Since these instructions are required for OS core font quality aliased fonts, but not anti-aliased, to some extent, Linux font quality is a waiting game, though not much longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(edit) er, no actually the fonts (Vera) were licensed to GNOME&rdquo;
Er, actually the Vera copyright allows all uses including derived versions, so it is freeware to all users.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work-around to Apple’s patent on the bytecode interpreter by the Freetype people was to create an auto-hinter that does what you describe. The natural question is “How well does it work,” and that I can’t answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can. For readability purposes, auto-hinting One-size-fits-all outlines, i.e. fonts with no mastering capabilities, for low resolution (less than 200 ppi) aliased fonts, is hopeless. For the same purposes, auto-hinting One-size-fits-all outlines, for anti-aliased fonts, is hopeless below 96 or so. Many other possibilities exist with multiply mastered, or single master enabled outlines, and Linux might be a great future platform for typography, but not until the w3c makes some changes.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you read some of the comments above and look at the issues I think that &ldquo;user preference&rdquo; is a bit of a red herring. In some cases the same users may want text to as accurately as possible reflect the appearance of the printed page, legibility isn&rsquo;t that important. In other cases you want to read or proof content. I think that&rsquo;s where the Windows vs MacOS differences come in. In other cases, say in the UI of a device, you&rsquo;re not reading extended text, just want the UI elements, phone numbers and song titles to be non-ambiguous - quirky(like on the RAZR) or blurry (like on the iPod) is good enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On another note, does anyone here know whether Windows applies hints before it applies antialiasing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My understanding, and I could be completely wrong, is that Windows (like other OS&rsquo;s) overscales and then down-samples to get the grayscale bitmaps - so hints are applied at the overscaled size unless the gasp table says not to apply hints.</p>
<p>The problem may relate to very thin fonts like Courier - where drop-out control essentially provides the bi-level bitmap. Even before ClearType people (HP?) were shipping bolder Couriers to overcome this problem on 600dpi printers.</p>

<p>This contradicts what I was told, but it might be true. An easy way to tell would be to produce a waterfall sample with a hinted font, and a copy of that font with hints stripped. Then diff the images.</p>

<p>I was thinking more about the GPL and the requirement to make source code available and freely modifiable and extendable.</p>

<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so - you might want to see the notes published by Victor about the SIL license - I think this explains why he thinks GPL is no good for fonts.</p>
<p>However my original comment remains - I don&rsquo;t think many type designers would turn down a paid commission to create a font that the client may decide to distribute under GPL.</p>
<p>I think a lot of work-for-hire contracts for custom fonts would allow the client to do whatever they like with their property if they really wanted to.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean the designer would be totally happy with about it - I recall when we issued the Web fonts under a free license that allowed redistribution, one of the typographic engineers invovled was quite vocal on a public list about the folly of Microsoft providing free fonts.</p>

<p>Ah. Thanks, sii; I missed the work-for-hire aspect the first time around and was only thinking about designers selling fonts on their own behalf.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the bottom line here on Apple? I&rsquo;ve been thinking about switching from a PC to an iMac because of the convenient form factor and not having to worry so much about malware. Will I go blind from bad font rendering if I buy an iMac? Should I buy the iMac and then tweak the OS settings per the discussion here?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a CompUSA in Tustin. Go over there and try out the macs and pcs and see what you like. There are issues that probably outweigh the type rendering quality when making such a decision. The difference isn&rsquo;t so great that it overrides concerns like non-consensual browser upgrades, viruses, compatibility, bundled software, setup time, OS, all-in-one issues, etc. It&rsquo;s more important that you decide how you want to use your new computer, and for what. Note that you can use a Mac as a PC now anyway, though that won&rsquo;t change the appearance. For that matter you can use it as a Unix machine as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a Cinema Display for 4 years, and I have to say it&rsquo;s a gigantic improvement in crispness over my previous monitor (a giant heavy blurry CRT). There are several excellent fonts I use for most everything (Lucida Grande, Georgia, Verdana, Andale Mono), I have my font sizes relatively small, I read online a lot, and I don&rsquo;t suffer headaches in my daily work (I&rsquo;m a type designer).</p>
<p>The difference in font/rendering quality that people are discussing really is very subjective. No computer/OS/font/renderer combo is giving anyone an environment approximating a book anyway. People like their type looking different; the opinions here should make it clear.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Carl, thank you for the suggestion. I actually live within walking distance of the Tustin Marketplace. I went to the Apple store in South Coast Plaza earlier this year, but the font issue wasn&rsquo;t in my mind at that point. If I&rsquo;m going back to SCP, it has to be before the Christmas rush (which should be starting any day now). SCP at Christmas &ndash; the mere thought makes me want to move out of state. But the Fry&rsquo;s in Anaheim is also within striking distance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right about the other concerns you list &ndash; those are the kinds of things I&rsquo;m considering, and the reason I haven&rsquo;t made a decision yet.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Carl, when everything in a &ldquo;T&rdquo; is crisp except its horizontal bar has a gray &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; on top, that&rsquo;s Not Good. If that doesn&rsquo;t matter then neither do discussions about serifs, or readability, or pretty much anything else on Typophile. Reading blurry text is known to cause headaches. Text that&rsquo;s slightly blurry most probably suffers from this slightly, but still does, and over time manifests itself (sooner).</p>
<p>Nothing is totally subjective, and -as David mentioned- platform preferences often cloud our objectivity. One advantage I might have in this respect is that I think both platform are crap.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, don&rsquo;t conflate the limited importance of rendering on various platforms with every other issue we discuss. Remember Readerability? It is very much at work here. People have to get work done and their concerns are probably much different than yours. Since the typeface design itself, letter spacing, line spacing and contrast influence reading comfort as much as this blurriness, especially at this low level, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s something to weigh more than other usability factors when choosing a new computer. Again, no combination of hardware and software is giving anyone an optimal reading environment, and everyone needs to read onscreen different amounts. I don&rsquo;t read books online, for example. At the same time, any current environment is an improvement over what was available 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Since this issue is an evolving one, all our hand-wringing about blurry type may be moot before Gus' new computer is obsolete.</p>

<p>I totally agree. But that shouldn&rsquo;t impede the realization/admission that OSX&rsquo;s rendering leaves much to be desired. What is quality without the minding of details? Why did you spend 14 years finishing Beorcana?</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of hinting (especially not delta-hinting) when a font does have hinting, chances are it helps, and ignoring that is bad. Making all fonts look equally lousy is an entirely empoverished justification.</p>
<p>Any rendering smaller than about 22 PPEM needs human help.</p>

<p>Not for a long, long time. And design is best when it&rsquo;s useful now or soon.</p>

Hmmm, thanks for asking. (peanut)</p>
<p>The original advice Microsoft gave to font developers was to hint TT for CT the same as TT for Aliased type and let it be. Then, 2.5 years later discusssion brought us (yawn) to the realization that this was not practical, so we asked again. In the context of pointing out to Mr. Hudson, that this new technology was not well positioned for most foundries to take advantage of, Mr. Hudson said his foundry was able to do the entire CT collection without rocket scientists. I pressed on this until it wasn&rsquo;t true, and eventually got Greg to respond:</p>
<p>For existing fonts, some of the deltas and delta-like instructions were causing a significant amount of distortion to the glyphs under ClearType&ndash;so we disabled some of these instructions in certain situations. It was not our intent, though, to reduce the TrueType instruction set. To handle this situation, we added a new flag to the INSTCTRL instruction that returns the full functionality of the instruction set to the hints. The INSTCTRL can be used globally in the pre-program to work for the whole font, or individually in glyph programs to impact only the current glyph. This last usage can be helpful when updating legacy fonts.</p>
<p>Mr: Hudson then responded, (yawn):
Well that sounds worth investigating. Is this documented someplace, Greg?</p>
<p>I then asked for a definitive list of the hints the CT filterer ignored, (thinking, well, I&rsquo;ll just leave those out then :)), and that, my dear man, was (yawn), mid-July.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I checked and we’re not sure what changes you’re talking about — &quot;
Is that, now, &ldquo;what changes&rdquo; or &ldquo;which changes&rdquo; (the answer to which is worth a small but perfectly ripened bunch of bananas.)</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The technique we use for font smoothing (anti-aliasing or gray scaling) in Windows is to first hint the outline, which usually grid-fits the major stems. Then we overscale and filter. This technique was explicitly chosen to reduce the blur. This behavior can be changed on a per-font basis by adjusting the gasp table in the font (not that I approve this method, but see: <a href="http://www.aqua-soft.org/board/showthread.php?t=29701">http://www.aqua-soft.org/board/showthread.php?t=29701</a> )&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also in the corrections department I was in touch with a couple of folks at Apple and my &ldquo;Mac OS X doesn&rsquo;t use hints&rdquo; claim was wrong, what MacOS does was described as being very complex, with various layers, and app-specific options in play, but at small sizes hints are applied in some cases. The source of my confusion was a comment by them that they are not having fonts hinted anymore, which is very different from the idea that they are ignoring existing hints completely.</p>

I agree most rocket scientists are not interested in type. And, no, it doesn&rsquo;t take much for MS to put in an instruction, or as many instructions as they want, Adobe and Apple too. It&rsquo;s a good indication of the direction MS and Apple are headed on TT though. One way is to turn off instructions entirely or use them all, but in any case, to make it clear to all what you&rsquo;ve done.  Another&rsquo;s to turn off some instructions and turn on who you want to which ones you&rsquo;ve turned off, in this case, but there might even be other instructions, at any time.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So I went to an Apple Store earlier today, fired up the TypeTester site, with the OSX* a-a cutoff control panel also in view, and tried various combinations of fonts, sizes and settings. Although -according to what Simon has been told- my findings might only apply to web browsing (and maybe even only the particular browser I tried) this is arguably the most significant area of screenfont display quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Version 10.4.8</li>
</ul>
<p>The two important things I found were that: the a-a cutoff is indeed also a hinting cutoff (not a huge surprise); and my hunch about the cutoff value was correct, it&rsquo;s 8 (I tried five different computers and they were all at 8). The significance of this is that almost no text (except things like legal disclaimers&hellip; hmmm&hellip; :-) will end up being rendered aliased/hinted. BTW Simon, you might want to get back to your &ldquo;12&rdquo; source about this.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s pretty strange though is that at 8 and below a-a looks legible (down to 6, typically) but aliased is not legible that low.* In fact some superhinted fonts, like Georgia, don&rsquo;t even seem to be hinted below 9 PPEM**. So the net result I feel is that the cutoff is doing more harm than good, since almost no user will raise it above the default of 8. Also, you can&rsquo;t raise it above 12, which is generally too low an upper limit for somebody savvy enough to be messing with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>BTW, the legibility cutoff difference of a-a versus aliased seems to be
between 1 and 3 PPEM (depending on the font) in favor of the former.</li>
</ul>
<p>** A given font&rsquo;s GASP settings -ignored by OSX- play into this of course.</p>

<p>Why&rsquo;s that? I mean, ad hoc 9 ppm - 13 ppm Antialiased type is pretty close to, though not exactly readable to most bipeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it wasn’t just added recently? It was there the whole time or something?&rdquo;
Depends on your defintion of whole or something. But I doubt MS could have drawn the CT Collection in &lsquo;03 without both the instruction(s) and the response of the system to those new instructions already in place and tested on legacy TT fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s not the cutoff feature that does more harm than good, it&rsquo;s the setting of it at 8*. It does more harm than good because for between about 6 and 8 PPEM it makes text unnecessarily illegible. The feature&rsquo;s plus side -that it allows people to change it- is negated by the fact that: almost nobody will change it; and it doesn&rsquo;t go above 12.</p>
<ul>
<li>Although I do maintain my innuendo :-) that they set it low because the Important People didn&rsquo;t want the cutoff feature to matter. But I guess now they have the best of both worlds because they can get users to view text the way they think is best (for Apple!) but they can still say &ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s in there - you can change it if you like!&rdquo; although as I said the max is 12 - tellingly too low. Let&rsquo;s think about why they didn&rsquo;t allow the savvies who would bother changing the cutoff to go all they way to where the superhinted fonts (or even the just the well-hinted fonts) no longer need to be hinted? And what&rsquo;s so hard -especially if their rendering decisions are already &ldquo;complex&rdquo;- about checking to see how good a font&rsquo;s hinting is and then deciding how to render it? (Sorry my asterisked text was longer than the body. :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>The cutoff feature itself is better than not having it at all,
but only because OSX&rsquo;s base rendering philosophy is flawed.  :-/</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s NOT the Windows rendering.
That&rsquo;s your Mac&rsquo;s rendering, and that&rsquo;s exactly the point.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the text looks like on my actual Windows machine,
with your screen grabs at the bottom for direct comparison:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/grab_4227.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>In comparison to my <cite>native</cite> aliased rendering (not that Georgia wasn&rsquo;t designed to work on Macs (pre-OSX) just as well) your a-a rendering looks like an expired dairy product. But best of all would be a-a rendering that&rsquo;s not blurry, which is not impossible, just not dirt cheap. You&rsquo;d think Apple was a cut-rate product, but it&rsquo;s the opposite! Like I always say, you can sell dogfood to a cat owner for double the price if you market it well enough.</p>
<p>But maybe you&rsquo;re using a word processor to render my text, and the necessity of preserving linebreaks (between screen and print) in that situation causes the font renderer to use the outline metrics, without spacing hints. At least I hope for the sake of Mac users that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening, because otherwise it means the disease of WYSIWYG has infected the Mac much worse than it has infected Windows&hellip; which howevever wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising.</p>
<p>But thanks to you I now realize the real reason why Apple decided to go
with total-abandon a-a: WYSIWYG, our eternal collective digital curse.</p>

<p>I have access to Windows PCs and the possibility to compare them with Macs side by side. It’s a torture when I have to write some paper on Windows Word. It might be just because I’m used to smooth text (we read best what we read most) but the same applies to you, too.</p>

<p>Then I can honestly tell you that I prefer it, in theory, because: a. what Hrant is talking about, the user&rsquo;s ability to slide the size up or down at which AA takes affect, is what the GASP table of TT does, a table which Windows reacts to (I think), and b. Mac does not (I think). What this means, is that the type designer could have some control over what the user(s) get(s), which is important because there are a lot of different &ldquo;typefaces&rdquo; and resolutions in the world.</p>
<p>Now, if we can just ram the Mac head-on into the Windows, peacefully, like Reece&rsquo;s did with chocolate and peanut butter, we could get an OS that both respects the gasp table, and lets the user control overall AA on/off, and intensity, and all be sitting in peanut butter cups, instead of something not entirely unlike a choice between lizard poop fondue (bad fonts in a good renderer), or a chocolate bar in a blanket of burn bacon, (the opposite).</p>
<p>Me: I doubt MS could have drawn the CT Collection in ‘03 without [documentation of a new instruction]…</p>
<p>Hrant: But I thought John H found out about it with us? Hmmm, question: When he asked on[-]list for more documentation from MS about the feature, did he get a reply?</p>
<p>John didn&rsquo;t need to, is the short answer. The medium length answer is that developers who want to explore and possibly provide a wide range of innovative solutions to the wide range of styles and scripts customers are seeking, are the only ones who really need to know. And the long answer involves 1/2 of what the instruction is about, backward compatibility to existing MS TT fonts, which, along with hinting, is not John&rsquo;s concern.</p>
<p>Put in terms this list will understand, it&rsquo;s time to turn it up to 12 or more, but Mom has the remote.</p>
