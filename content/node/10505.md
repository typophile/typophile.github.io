body: Hello, <BR> <BR>These fonts, &#34;E Ten&#34; and &#34;E Seventeen&#34;. were
  suggested by one of our vendors. I&#39;ve been trying to find licensing information
  on it and I&#39;m getting blank. I&#39;ll post a small sample. Any help you can
  give me would be great! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70546.jpg"

    the E! channel <BR> <BR>Hoefler&#39;s Knockout is close.

  body: I&#39;d guess maybe they are &#39;pseudo-names&#39;, such as the ones Printers
    and Stationers make up to avoid using the copyrighted names of commercial fonts.
    <BR> <BR>E17 looks like Alternate Gothic No. 1, or one of the other numbered Gothics.  <BR>
    <BR>E10 could be another of the Gothics or even Helvetica compressed. <BR> <BR>In
    my opinion one of these commercial fonts would be nearly indistinguishable to
    all but a Typophile fanatic, and you would know what you were dealing with, license-wise.
