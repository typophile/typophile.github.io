body: "I am looking at creating concept logos for a country hotel. It is a historical
  building, with oak paneling etc; and the owners want to project the place as somewhere
  for adults to enjoy some peace and quiet in countryside surroundings - with spa
  facilities and great cuisine!\r\n\r\nI am thinking of an all caps or small caps
  logotype coupled with a stylised illustration of the wrought iron gates that protect
  the entrance. From memory I am thinking of copperplate, trajan pro, requiem, castellar...
  \r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest other similar alternatives - better still, fonts with
  alternative swash options (although I want to avoid too script-like an appearance).\r\n\r\nI'm
  going to go for double jeopardy now, and ask for people's thoughts on a body typeface
  that projects a warm modern feeling with a hint at the historical significance of
  the building... I'm a fan of Warnock, but <a href=\"http://www.ourtype.be/home.swf\">Versa
  from ourtype</a> has caught my eye. Comments?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for any feedback!\r\n\r\nSteve"
