  body: It&#39;s definitely no version of Copperplate Gothic. Can you give us any
    idea about the age of this sample? The typeface looks like something quite old
    &#40;75-100 years old&#41; would be my first guess, and quite possibly never made
    as a digital font. <BR> <BR>I am hunting my type books now, but it would help
    to know the era that this sample comes from.

  body: In many little way this reminds me of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/cantoria-mt/semi-bold/testdrive.html?s=GRAND%2BHOTELL&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank">Cantoria</a> ... and in all the places it doesn&#39;t, it seems
    manipulated. The beard on the G, the uncomforably uptight R, the forced apexes
    on the A and the N &#40;and the undersized counter on the A&#41;, the O would
    be easy enough to redraw, and the middle arm on E and the crossbar on the T shortened.

  body: To me it&#39;s clearly a handdrawn custom logo. Cantoria is very well designed.
    It would require a real pro to hack it to obtain such an ugly logo.

  body: We still haven&#39;t heard that this comes from something new enough to have
    been done digitally. I agree Cantoria &#40;or Della Robbia&#41;,or Flange, or
    Newtext, or other current fonts could be manhandled to look like this, but it
    may be that an old European metal type was exactly this face. I wish the poster
    Kari would give us a clue about the origin of this sample. The spelling of Hotell
    already suggest a continental European origin, and I for one have a very weak
    knowledge of Continental typefaces.

    the 19th <BR>century. I dont know mutch more about it. <BR>Se theirs homepage

    <BR> <BR>I think i can use Cantoria to make a new original logo for them. That
    will be a god start. <BR> <BR>This is the first time i use this forum, i&#39;m
    impressed for the fast support and help i got. <BR> <BR>I will be back, and help
    others if i can. <BR> <BR>'

  body: Looking at that web site, the lettering of &#34;MARSTRAND&#34; added an M
    and and S. I think <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/della-robbia/bold/testdrive.html?s=GRAND%2BHOTELL%2BMARSTRAND&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank">Della Robbia</a> is a closer starting point, and it comes from
    a closer time period &#40;designed in 1902&#41;. Note the crotch of the M is higher
    and the serifs on it have a closer look to the lettering on the site. Thomas Cleland
    made Della Robbia based on rubbings of stonecut letters he saw in Rome, so the
    letterforms are certainly old enough to perhaps have influenced the designer of
    this typeface too. &#40;Of course, when the hotel was built does not prove when
    the typeface was designed, but I am assuming this typeface has been used by them
    for a long time.&#41;
