  of faces to choose from when building a web site. Often, when I see a site targetted
  at children (or even youth), the first gut reaction always seems to be \"hey, let's
  use comic sans because it's 'friendly' and 'kid's will like it'\"\r\n\r\nBut do
  they? Does using a cheesy face like that actually target that demographic better?
  Or is it just pandering? Baby talk? Insulting? Is there any scrap of data out there
  that would indicate one or the other?"

  body: I suggest spending some time in a children's book store (or the children's
    section of a book store). Sure, you'll see some Comic Sans, but you may be surprised
    at the range of typefaces intended to appeal to children. It's not so much the
    typeface as how it's used. Things like color and composition are more important
    than the font.

    been anything that could be considered 'data obtained from research' that would
    indicate whether or not children actually benefit and/or prefer bad hand scrawling.
    ;o)\r\n\r\nAction: \r\n\r\nI've read a bit about the dyslexia issue, but it seems
    that there's a wide variety of faces that can work and that the main issue is
    having a closed 'a' and an open 'g'. I'll have to check...perhaps Comic Sans is
    the only web-friendly face that has that attribute.\r\n\r\nOf course, then there's
    the issue as to whether or not the benefit to those with dyslexia outweighs any
    other potential drawbacks to using Comic Sans. \r\n\r\nPaul:\r\n\r\nThat thread
    then links to this thread:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/14206\r\n\r\nwhich
    I actually participated in. 'doh. Gotta work on my memory skills. ;o)\r\n\r\nThe
    comments I tended to agree with in that thread were 'kids don't like to be treated
    like kids' and the use of comic sans seems to do just that. It's almost 'hey,
    you're a kid, here' some rainbows and unicorns and comic sans!'\r\n\r\nBut that's
    just my opinion. Certainly not any sort of research.\r\n\r\nThe only research
    that seems compelling is that the youngest children, who are still sounding out
    their words, depend on simple, recognizable letterforms. And as ugly as Comic
    Sans is, I guess that's where it has some appeal, as the letterforms are quite
    simple. \r\n\r\nThis site was mentioned:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kidstype.org/\r\n\r\nBut
    when it got to kids opinions, it seemed to leave us hanging:\r\n\r\n<em>Discussions
    with children about these further confirmed that typefaces can have an important
    effect on how children perceive a text, and hence their motivation to read. Associations
    can be strong, and there seems to be some comfort for young children in reading
    things that look familiar or 'normal'. Many of the children we spoke with were
    able to talk about the differences between the typefaces.</em>\r\n\r\n...and!?

    sans serif that were very easy to read. Such as Century, Futura, etc.\r\n\r\nThat

    just doesn't talk about bright red, bright blue and bright yellow. Yet a lot of
    products aimed at kids assume that's the only 3 colors in their universe.\r\n\r\nI
    have a hunch that comic sans falls into the same logic that is used to pick colors
    for kids.\r\n\r\nHigh contrast black, white and red have been studied as good
    colors for the very young (infants) but I haven't seen any research beyond that.\r\n\r\nIn
    the end, it sounds like there hasn't been any real research into the pros/cons
    of comic sans, and, as such, we need to fall back on our own training and point
    out that it's an ugly face and no sense using an ugly face when we don't have

  body: "Sounds like a lot of people who make design decisions for children were never
    children themselves. I really don't buy the patronizing, oversimplifying twaddle
    that is presumed to enable children to comprehend, to see, to sense. Simon actually
    has a point; though children aren't born with high visual acuity, nor the ability
    to read, they are tremendously perceptive, curious, and absorbent of their visual
    surroundings. Their brains process and develop incredibly fast, and they move
    from one thing to another like ravenous caterpillars. Assuming that subtle colors
    and 2-storied a's are wasted on them really sells them short. A lack of imagination
    on an adult's part should not hinder a child's experience. Children have no trouble
    learning 2 or 3 languages simultaneously. That's not whistling Dixie!\r\n\r\nI
    find I'm also reverting to the adult pattern of lumping all children of every
    age together. I bet developmental psychologists perceive dozens of brief distinct
    stages in development between birth and adolescence. \r\n\r\nI think the concern
    with \"infant forms\" such as the a in Comic Sans is relevant for a VERY BRIEF
    PERIOD when children are learning the alphabet, and how to read. I suspect that
    once that skill has been mastered, suddenly, large print, infant forms and other
    silliness are completely irrelevant. But don't tell mom and dad! \r\n\r\ngigGle!"

    to mind something I often struggle with. I wish I remembered the reference but
    I can't so I hope this is right. Children only need larger type at the early years
    of reading when they are learning character recognition, The part I am guessing
    about is the age. I remember it as about 9 years old (earlier for quick learners).
    At this point they have developed full visual acuity. Thereafter, size does not
    matter (type size that is). By middle school, their eyes are as developed as they
    will ever be. That is why when I am trying to read very small type (serial numbers
    from a DIMM) I show it to a 12 year old who can see it clear as day unaided. I
    need more than my trifocals and a magnifying glass to have a prayer.\r\nThe problem
    is I have clients who insist on at least 14pt type for anyone below college age!
    Even when I try to explain how they are limiting saccadic jumps with such large
    type and slowing down reading, they don't care. They say \"but this is for kids.\"\r\nI
    wish researchers would come up with something like the \"Type Pyramid\" where
    they would definitively establish thresholds of type size for each age group in
    increments of 5 years.\r\nChrisL"
