body: Can you please help me find out the name of this font?  I am racking my brain.  An
  example of this font is located at <a href="http://www.gimmesum.com" target="_blank">www.gimmesum.com</a>.  The
  font is being used in the logo and is at the top of the page...the Gimme Sum words
  next to the buddha.

  body: That&#39;ll get you close Dave, although it also reminds of an Image Club
    or Letraset font I can&#39;t quite place. Maybe Grant will chime in...

  body: Marc, are you are thinking of Badloc? <BR> <BR>Not an exact match, but could
    have been modified a wee bit ... <BR><a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=405816"

  body: That&#39;s the one, BJ. <BR> <BR>Looking at now, though, I&#39;d say Industria
    is closer. <BR> <BR>Sorry for the detour...

  body: 'It&#39;s very likely a modified version of my Badloc face, although given
    the geometric nature of the font, it could have very easily been drawn from scratch.
    For comparison, here is the original logo, an unmodified version of Badloc, and
    a version of Badloc with the lowercase compressed to 85% and scaled vertically
    to 120%. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/35672.jpg"
    alt="Gimme Sum logo samples set in modified Badloc"> <BR> <BR>It could also be
    a modified version of Neville Brody&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/industria/solid/testdrive.html?s=Gimme%20Sum&amp;p=72">Industria</a>.
    <BR> <BR>The similar Letraset face is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/mekanik/regular/testdrive.html?s=Gimme%20Sum&amp;p=72">Mekanik</a>.
