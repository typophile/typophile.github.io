  body: FontMesa, publisher of the  Red Dog Saloon font, also has a spurred version
    called Go West http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/go-west/ If you want more
    fonts with the style of serif in Red Dog Saloon/57 Rodeo check out the those tagged
    at Myfonts as "Mansard" or "Detroit Serif."
