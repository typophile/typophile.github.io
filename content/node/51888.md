  typographer, but have never really had my stuff critiqued by people that know what
  they are talking about... just coworkers, etc. So, in my mind I did a good job on
  this... but I would like to know what you guys see as places that improvements could
  be made. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arabtypography_3891.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arab_money_t-shirt_asphalt_6550.jpg]\r\n\r\nthis

  body: I personally would have tightened it up across the board. I think that the
    "That" is pretty damn perfect. I woulda stuck with that spacing throughout. Great
    outcome and shirt design however. Keep it up.
