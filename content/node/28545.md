  body: '*headscratch* Being a journalist you are very short on words or explanations.
    You ID''d the font yourself as <a href="http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/">Apex
    New</a> in various weights, which is right I think. But: What do you want to know? '

  body: "You nailed me. OK. I confess. I have a bit of exhibition design work. The
    catalogue for the show had originally used another face. I just got an e-mail
    saying the design had changed, so I downloaded the current PDF for the catalogue.
    The face looked familiar, but being pressed for time (meeting on the 5th) I decided
    to upload and image. Almost immediately I remembered what it was, and answered
    my own question.\r\n\r\nIt has been more than 10 years since I've worked as a
    writer, but I still like short and sweet. And I still can't spell.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    I'll wait 5 minutes before I post next time and not clog up the works. I'm half
    asleep and just took the puppy out for a wizz."
