  body: "Frode, this picture is a bit too fuzzy to see details well. From the few
    letters I can be fairly sure about I get a list of about 154 candidates in the
    [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif Guide]]. If you
    can describe the g, y, a and e it should be possible to really narrow this down.
    Also, any hint about the age of this, to help rule out fonts that are newer.\r\n\r\n-

    Did you spot the pointed \u201Cj\u201D? That wide \u201Cg\u201D might also be
    helpful."
