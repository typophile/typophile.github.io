  can you utilise ligatures using Quark 6.0 for Windows? I've read somewhere that
  Windows does not support ligatures. Is this correct?\r\nUsing Quark 6.0 with Windows.

    fonts. QuarkXPress 6 only supports the standard ligatures in Type 1 fonts, but
    I don't know how :P\r\n\r\nA."

    3 and 4 only supported ligatures in the Mac version, not on Windows. This led
    to some interesting compatibility issues between the Mac and Windows versions.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    and set full ligatures -- the five f-ligs, plus whatever else was needed. But
    that was using TeX in a DOS box within Windows.\r\n\r\nI believe some of the expert
    sets included fi and fl as well as the double-f's. As with Mac, their names in
    such expert sets are a lie. If you are using one of those Type 1 fonts plus \"expert\"
    set, you could set the ligatures with a font change + new character assignment."
