body: "Hi,\r\nI was asked to provide an alternative Arabic (Persian) glyph for zero
  for mathematical expression. Zero in most font faces is shaped as a rather large
  dot. This is confusing for its use in mathematical expression, in which, it is often
  used with a shape as a small O.\r\nThe question is not how to add the glyph, rather,
  what is the best way for an application to access it without activating a whole
  bunch of other 'alternative' glyphs?\r\nI have a simple solution in AAT for that.
  But in OT I don't know how to go about it.\r\n\r\nI was also thinking about adding
  some substitution scheme that is independent form applications. Such as zero+zwnj->zero.alt
  that could be encoded directly to get the mathematical zero. But I'm not sure how
  'legal' this would be!"
