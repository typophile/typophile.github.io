    fit my concept of a Clarendon or Square. It really is an odd man out in the serif
    world.\r\n\r\nOf course, if measurements were made according to the very hard-to-find
    documentation, it may fall elsewhere."

  body: "Thanks George, I can see the logic in what you are saying about 9-exagerated
    as perhaps being the best of the limited choices under Panose in Fontlab.\r\nAny
    thoughts about the best place to pigeonhole it in the IBM Class choices?\r\nBTW,
    if anyone else cares to venture a view, on either the Panose or IBM choices, perhaps
    you might share it.\r\nDon"

  body: "My best shot at IBM would have to be Class 7, Subclass 15 -- Free-Form Serif,
    Miscellaneous. My second choice would be to use Class 7, Subclass 1 -- Free-Form
    Serif, No Classification. \r\n\r\nNothing else really fits. You could just omit
    the IBM classification entirely as others often do. Personally I only use Panose."
