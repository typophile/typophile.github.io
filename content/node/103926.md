body: "I've been brooding over Verdana for a while, and since I had some free time
  last weekend, I decided to make my own Verdana-esque typeface; but without those
  odd terminals. I started with (roughly) the dimensions of Verdana, and just worked
  my way through the glyps, and ended up with something that, to my eye, is an interesting
  amalgamation of News Gothic and Verdana, with some Myriad trown in. What do you
  think?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ababdon_6497.png]\r\n"

  body: "Are Book and Medium two separate weights?\r\nsome suggestions:\r\nAcute and
    grave placement on the O/o is off.\r\nQuotation marks are too small. \r\nIs J
    too narrow? t may be a bit top heavy. \r\nNotch at upper right of g and q looks
    indecisive. \r\nSuperior figs too big. I don't think the barred OS one works in
    this monoline style. The little tie in % also seems out of place. I like the idea
    of oldstyle-height %, but it gets awfully wide. \r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Craig-\r\n\r\nThis started as a Medium, but I then decided it to
    be Book weight. \r\nYou're righ; fixing those acutes and graves.\r\nAnd I'll look
    into those J and t.\r\nAnd right again; those need more depth. I'll definetily
    fix those to compliment p.\r\nAnd I believe I have to go through your other commets
    as well, since they seem to make sense to me. But like I said, I only strated
    this last weekend, and really only got in touch with the overall feel of the font,
    so this is still in a design study stage, rather than a final product.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."

  body: "Looks nicely sober - if predictable. Reminds me of FHWA (AKA Interstate)
    too. And I like seeing \"rationalist\" (AKA mirrored) quotes.\r\n\r\nI would shorten
    the descenders. And the spacing is too loose (at least for print). Also, the caps
    are <em>almost</em> the height of the tittles; I would match the heights.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
