  body: "Okay here goes, Segoe Script was developed by Monotype Imaging for Microsoft
    specifically for the Windows Vista Tablet PC help system. Previously Tablet had
    been using bitmaps in their help files to demonstrate the \u201Cink UI\u201D of
    the product, using a font would greatly simplify the creation and localization
    of these help services. The font is a contextual handwriting font, designed to
    be subtle rather than an out-there showcase font (like say Bickham or Zapfino).
    Also includes Greek and Cyrillic. Segoe Print is a non-cursive version for use
    where OT Layout is not available, also is slightly more legible at tiny sizes
    on screen. It currently only comes with Windows Vista, isn\u2019t part of Office,
    the Office Compatibility pack or elsewhere. \r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to
    make the font available to regular users, I\u2019ll look into this. Don\u2019t
    think this will happen in time to help Mike."
