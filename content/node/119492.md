    you don't own it and don't want to buy it, I believe there is a free Google font
    that is a spot-on match, called News Cycle.\r\n\r\nThanks for posting this cover.
    While some people may find it too simple, I think it is refreshingly understated
    and direct."

    to see what else the designer, Rodrigo Corral has done.  Boy, was I blown away
    by the amount of work I own of his and never knew, and great work at that.  Thanks
    again. '
