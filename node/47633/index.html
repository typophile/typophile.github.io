  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've developed a logo concept for a cute/quirky custom stationery company that focuses on custom birthday invitations, birth announcements, holiday greetings, etc. The main theme behind the company is to celebrate the little things in your big life. The central theme of the product is based on family events. 

The target audience is mother's, ages 25-42, mid-high income bracket. She probably enjoys reading Cookie magazine and taking Starbucks coffee breaks.

The logo is intended to be fun, approachable, and representative of the look and feel of the products the company is selling.

I got so much great feedback with my last logo posting, I hope to get the same amount of critique and debate with this one. This forum is great. Thanks in advance!

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Tiffany too! It needs a touch of asymmetry with the text treatment. Have a play with a small 'little' and a huge 'big' - an overlap may work well. Give it a sense of drama.

I HATE the Gotham. Try something more modern with personality, less classic. Each letter of the word 'big' could be asymmetrical too...might be too much but worth exploring.

I also think the blue could be a touch brighter. White text with pink offset/hard drop shadow (1950s/60s style) on a stronger blue arrow? Might be worth looking at getting both pink and blue in there with the family theme.

Just some ideas but i think you are on the right track.</div>

Oh, color is just for fun for now, I want the logo to be 1 color -- but I'm not settled on what that color would be (the orange looks a little "Home Depot" to me).

Sorry, I got a little carried away, but still, using Arial in a logo makes baby Jesus cry. Try switching to Helvetica, or better yet, something not so bland.

I like your choice of font for "little" and "life", but I would letter it by hand based on Wendy (after all, it's only ten characters). That way you could fix the awkward way the 'e's connect to the previous letters.

		<div class="commentbody">Do you have <em>[[http://www.vllg.com/KLIM/National/mudTyper+Weights|National?]]</em>, you should try it. I think it would really sit well with <em>Wendy</em>. Especially when you see the italic. Kind of quirky and fun! It would also be a great typeface/textface for additional use with the brand mark.

Oh and if you do use the Italics, try sheer them -10% gives you a beautiful new version!

p.s I like the first version better then the second one! the <em>BIG</em> has room to breath, I also don't think you need to rotate each letter in the word <em>BIG</em> I think there is plenty going on already…

But what the hell do I know… hehe!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bobby: I really like your hand drawn version of "little" -- I could never do it that well!

You guys got me -- I picked Arial...I can't believe that it was me that made baby Jesus cry....I had no idea it was a faux pax. Eeek! :)

Seriously, though, I'm having major trouble with my font selection (in general)
when I'm looking for something 'plain' to pair with a face that has some personality to it. Do you guys have a resource for this or is it just something you've come to know by instinct? Like, how do you know when picking a 'classic' typeface is good and when is it bad?

As for National -- I really like the font overall. I adore the LC letters but the UC letters (particularly the B-I-G together) don't seem interesting enough for me to use it in this logo. I think it would be great for a brochure job I'm working on, though. I love the depth of the family.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I thought that  about <em>National</em>, I think it would look good mainly as a text-face with Wendy!

Maybe you got it right the first time. I always say there is no point trying to look for something <em>similar but different</em> just because of the stigma attached to a certain typeface, In this case Gotham.

<strong>Jan</strong> stuck up a great list of typefaces that can be alternatives to a plain typeface such as Helvetica. <em>[[http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/helvetica-and-alternatives-to-helvetica|Helvetica Alternatives]]</em>.

I personally like to look at blogs, take note of typefaces I like or maybe have a look at foundries until I find something that is suitable to a particular project. I then organise my suitcase as I build my collection. Any typeface I have in my suitcase I have spent time to organise and I don't just have them for the sake of it!

I don't know if that made any sense... Rob!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe another one to consider is [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013|Knockout]]? I tried it out in the 54 Sumo weight really quick, and it has a wideness that contrasts with the script, and the quirky G might just be enough character to set it off without having to resort to rotated/quirkier/crazier type, since you already have the script going on.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/littlebiglife_4902.jpg]

Try Tornac and Foco Black.
