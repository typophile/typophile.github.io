		<div class="commentbody">Oh, dear. Yes, this logo is confusing. 

What's poor? 

Firstly, the eye doesn't easily read the words in any particular order. We don't know where to start. The position of the words makes it read backwards. Why is the text broken this way? 

Secondly, the text sizes make 'people' the least important part of the logo. At small sizes that word is going to become unreadable.

Thirdly the mix of type styles seems not to be purposeful. Why is 'people' in caps? Why is 'moving' in a serif font?

Fourthly, what are the segment and the swoosh supposed to represent? Why is the graphic element obscured by the text? It looks very cluttered. 

Fifthly, the m and p look poorly executed custom jobs.</div>

Careful then, I am strongly biased against homemade logos.

If there's room to change the name of the organisation I'd try that too. You could pay a professional designer to rebrand it into something unique that will really attract people on the strength of the logo alone.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scratch my above comment. I didn't realize a board of directors would be reading this. 

Here instead is my (a bit cheeky but considered) advice: 

1. Hire a designer and trust their experience and expertise (it's what you're paying for) to design. And yes, as with almost everything in life, you generally get exactly what you paid for in terms of talent, experience, ability and quality of ultimate outcome.

2. Take on a role of design expert or experienced art director in the project, if you've dedicated your professional life to the visual communications industry (or are secretly an unappreciated design genius—aren't we all). Otherwise, don't. 

3. Designers are not robots who "input my visionary direction into software programs I can't be bothered to learn." (If this approaches your conception of design, just hire a nephew who knows some photoshop).

4. And remember, the phrase "designed by committee" is never, ever, ever a compliment. (It also implies unsteady leadership and lack of vision). Even ten brilliant individual art director visionaries, if they're put on a committee with everyone's input given equal weight, will produce a compromised, negotiated, bland, mediocritized, unfocused pile of mush).

4. Did I just invent the use of mediocre as a verb? Mediocritized?

5. Final Step: If you've done step one and only step one, enjoy your organization's professional, apropos and unique new visual identity.

		<div class="commentbody">I didn't design this logo either, but I have to figure out how to minimize it's worst qualities so that we can portray this fabulous little company as what it truly is: fresh, unique and energetic.  

Unfortunately, one of the board members, working with a photographer, created this logo before my partner and I joined the board and took on design and tech support - pro bono - as our contribution.  

The company has invested money in having signs made, and so cannot afford a new logo at this point (not to mention that the board member who created the travesty is still around and screaming about artistic rape). 

I have a work-around, and everyone on the staff is happy with the new design direction.  This WILL come up at the next board meeting though, which is why we submitted it here and asked you all for your honest opinions.  Sometimes knowing you are right, and why you are right isn't enough.  You need back-up.  

Thank you for your help - I appreciate your time - and talent.

Thank you!!!

		<div class="commentbody">Any chance of building a real logo, rather than a wordmark? With a short company name, you can sometimes incorporate it into a logo. But with such a long name (I thought it was a moving company, for a few minutes) you should build a real logo with no text, just something that says "Dance" graphically. Then use it with the company name set beside it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's great that at least now you're talking about the values of the company: fresh, unique and energetic. You will need to think a little harder about what makes the company unique though, then hopefully you can start to think about how those values are portrayed in the logo. That's what branding is. The current logo communicates no brand at all and it unlikely to succeed on its own. (What I mean is that unless somebody already knows about the company they are unlikely to suddenly get interested by seeing just the current logo.) 

The unfortunate thing is, unless you have senior management buy-in you'll find that nothing can change. If they can't see for themselves that a new logo is an incredible asset, they're not going to be persuaded about something they don't understand.

I'm speaking from the perspective not of a designer here, but of someone who has in the last six months taken an international company through a dramatic rebrand and met with a fair amount of resistance. I'm still not sure our Managing Director is convinced of the reasons we rebranded, but he does trust out judgment and that has been really important. 

It sounds like the people in this company could benefit from talking to other organisations that have rebranded, to design agencies, and to their target market to find out their opinions. Our market thought our old brand was 'ok'. For a company positioning itself in the 'premium' category this was not what we wanted to hear. 

I hope I'm not teaching you to suck eggs :)</div>

But first, they have to want it. And they have to know and trust they are in good hands. 

I've learned you have to start with that (to do good work with fiscally poor, committee or consensus-driven passion organizations). </div>

		<div class="commentbody">When the time comes for the redesign--and you should keep pushing to make it sooner, not later--explain it to the board this way: They have certainly solved one problem with their logo, which is to capture the energy of dance. But how they would react if a dancer came to audition for them, and did nothing but flail his arms and legs and head around in different directions, completely out of step to any rhythm or music or the dancers around him, and without a care in the world for whether his movements were communicating anything but confusion and disarray to the audience? 

A logo that doesn't get across the name of the company, that has no graphic rhythm and unity, and can't be used in any practical graphic applications without destroying them is just like that dancer.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">may as well add my 2 cents worth. i thought initially the 'logo' was for a moving company perhaps? as a logo should somehow - almost magically - distill and present some important essence of the company; this misses the mark, especially for a dance company - no lines, no grace, no movement, no fluidity. while it is unnecessary to be harsh, i doubt this helps sell the company's service which is the purpose of such things, no?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">May I also say that logo is very badly made. It has nothing of a good logo to make it a good logo.

What it does, it screams: I am useless!</div>
