  the fonts that make up the text fields on the below graphic?\r\n\r\nThere are 14
  fields in total, but I am sure the 14 are comprised of no more than 3 fonts ie:
  I think most of them are variants of Helvetica (possibly?) although I am not sure
  which variants etc, this is where I need the help.\r\n\r\nIf you guys can maybe
  list the identities according to the numbers in the graphic, that would be superb.\r\n\r\nGraphic
  found here, not sure how to embed:\r\n\r\nhttp://img5.imagebanana.com/img/2c5l571o/fontid.jpg"

  body: "Thanks for the prompt response, Oldnick.\r\n\r\nYeah I have the Helvetica
    fonts pack, as they are pretty much a standard requirement by the FDA for food
    labels, its just that I am unsure which ones are used in the pic and the Helvetica
    pack has dozens of options.\r\n\r\nOh and, yes, I know number 4 is not Helvetica,
    hence my asking for an identification here ;)\r\n\r\nIs 5 a Helvetica too? I wasn't
    sure if it was just a simple ariel type font?\r\n\r\nThanks again for the input."
