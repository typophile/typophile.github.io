body: Eben Sorkin asked if I could give some examples of [[tilde]] design good and
  bad, so I compiled a good bit in [[http://mateo.elahorcado.net/blog.php?post=20080318152234|this
  post on my blog]].  Comments are welcome of course.

  body: Looks like it might have been an interesting page, had I been able to read
    the tiny type. And unfortunately, the coding did not allow me to switch to a larger
    font with my browser.

  body: "I was able to make the font bigger. I agree.\r\n\r\nI have some other suggestions.
    But I will offer them later. \r\n\r\nHis main idea is clear I think. \r\n\r\nIt
    might be useful to drop into a post though, just to make it easier to read.\r\n"

  body: "I second that! All three points, that is:\r\n\r\nGreat summary, interesting
    points. Thanks, Matthew.\r\n\r\nWhile I defintely prefer unobtrusive inline links
    to long lines of bulky URL rigmarole, the current implementation is way too subtle!\r\nUnder
    certain circumstances (screen angle, lighting, \u2026), I cannot tell apart the
    regular text in Georgia Roman, without underline, in medium gray \u2013 from link
    text in Georgia Roman, without underline, in grayish blue.\r\nCan\u2019t we have
    a <code>text-decoration:underline</code>, please? (It doesn\u2019t have to be
    the chunky default one.) And if that is too much of a revolution, what about a
    little icon, like the wiki entries have?\r\nI\u2019ve sent a <a href=\"http://typophile.com/contact\">feature
    request</a>; if others suffer from the same thing, please do so, too.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes, Matthew, your ideas deserve a better treatment than 10px type in lengthy
    lines. A max-width in ems would help a lot. \r\n\r\n[sorry for the off-topic comments]"

  body: "It should let you make the font bigger, in fact the majority of the page
    is based on em-scaling so changing font size should also nicely change image size
    as well. I just checked in FF, OmniWeb and Safari and Opera and the fonts go up.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yeah I need to work on my site a bit.  I've keep forgetting not everyone uses
    the smallest windows possible :)\r\n\r\nI would also like if any Portuguese-native
    users on the forums could tell me how they generally write the tilde over the
    A and the O. The standard Spanish handwriting for it I'm sure would be too easily
    confused for an acute accent.\r\n\r\nAlso if there's interest I can go back and
    find more examples of older tildes.  ([[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com|Cervantes
    Virtual Library]] is your friend). \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan
