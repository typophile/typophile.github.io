body: I&#39;ve been lurking here for a while and I really love the forum, very helpful!
  So, I finally decided to post something to be critiqued. This is something that
  I did with a crow quill pen and so far I have just caps and lowercase done. I&#39;m
  working on trying to get everything to connect and this is the first time I&#39;ve
  tryed something like this and it&#39;s kind of hard.&#60;br&#62; <BR>&#60;img&#62;

  body: hey jess, i&#39;ve been a fan of yer work for some time. I really like this
    one! getting all the connections right can be a pain esp for guys with ADD like
    me. The only thing i&#39;d say for now is that i&#39;d like to see this one in
    some longer settings, just to get a better feel of how all the caps fit in with
    the lc. but keep up the good work!

  body: The caps, they look a bit too heavy and maybe too big... I guess you could
    reduce them just a little. <BR>And the &#39;Z&#39; looks odd somehow. <BR> <BR>Nice
    font!

  body: Very nice. I agree with Eduardo&#39;s comment about the weight of your caps.
    A couple letters that might need a variant for connection ... <b>j</b>? &#40;looks
    like a <b>y</b> sitting next to the <b>i</b>&#41; ... The <b>u</b> going into
    the <b>v</b>? &#40;looks like a <b>w</b>&#41; ... and the <b>v</b> is it too abrupt?
    ... Is perhaps the <b>A</b> is a little too rotated? Could the bowl of the <b>p</b>
    be a little more curvy? Is the downward stroke on the back of the <b>p</b> too
    stiff? Is the <b>s</b> a little to wide/open? <BR> <BR>Love the stroke modulation
    by the way. Reminds me of Doris Day and Cary Grant movies. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: I was thinking the caps were too heavy too so I&#39;m glad that a few of you
    confirmed that! I&#39;ll take what everyone has said and see what I can do. Thanks!!

  body: Hi Paul, <BR> Not really. I started working on other projects and kind of
    forgot about it. That&#39;s my biggest problem as a font designer, hee.
