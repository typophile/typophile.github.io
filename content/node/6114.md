  body: There are various CDs commercially available that include UK roadsigns. <BR>
    <BR>If you didn&#39;t have one of these, the &#42;.pdf files would be a good starting
    point. <BR> <BR>They are not very &#34;smooth&#34;, being made up of many short
    straight lines, the points are however in the correct places.

  body: thanks for this. i wonder if those pdfs represent the MoT&#39;s digital master
    of Transport, or just a CAD conversion/output. <BR>  <BR>driving around, i have
    started to notice squished and stretched versions. i have also noticed helvetica
    used on directional signage.

  body: I really don&#39;t think that these are direct digital masters. <BR> <BR>There
    are 2 condensed fonts for motorway sign numbers, the permanent one is <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_roads/documents/page/dft_roads_026504.pdf"
    target="_blank">here</a> <BR> <BR>Some truly extraordinary signs do make it onto
    the streets, I&#39;ll post a couple of examples later.

    great. <BR> <BR>do you think doing a &#39;jan-albert pool&#39; on transport would
    be an idea? ie, fleshing out the character set, adding weights, making a sloped
    roman etc? <BR> <BR>what would be the position as regards copyright/permissions
    etc be, i wonder..'
