  what is a full set of punctuation marks?), what other special characters needs to
  be considered in order for a typeface to be complete?\r\n\r\nI want to complete
  one typeface which I started a while back, and start working on a few more.\r\n\r\nThanks
  guys!"

  body: "It depends.\r\n\r\nIt used to be you couldn't put more than 256 characters
    (including space and invisible controls) in a font. Each OS had different character
    sets it could deal with.\r\nThat's not so true anymore but it 's a place to start.
    It's better to focus on language support; which and how many you want to cover.\r\nA
    Latin-1 encoding will cover most western European languages, with sufficient accents
    and punctuation for English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Norwegian, Swedish,
    and Icelandic. That has about 193 characters, discounting the 63 control characters
    ordinarily left empty.\r\nMacRoman, Windows Latin, and Adobe Standard encodings
    have similar, though not identical character sets.\r\n\r\nIf you want to cover
    Turkish, Vietnamese, and Livonian, &.al., you will have a lot more work to do.
    That's just sticking with the Latin alphabet too, it gets really crazy with other
    scripts"

    symbols like the dashes, bullet, etc., maybe an ornament or two.\r\n\r\nLook through
    some commercial fonts in FontLab (if you are using that) and see what characters
    they used."

  body: "Using other people's fonts as a guide to which glyphs should be included
    may not be such a great idea. So many display fonts include a logical not symbol,
    generic currency and a broken bar - a complete waste of time.\r\n\r\nDecide at
    the beginning if math symbols are important for your font. In a display font (headliner)
    you can take it easy on the math symbols but keep the bar and <> as they're used
    for non math purposes these days. Skip florin, logicalnot, currency. Including
    Latin 1 and Latin 2 accents doesn't add a lot more time to font development. Skipping
    fractions in a display font isn't a crime but include the fraction slash (fraction).
    A paragraph symbol is unlikely to be used in a display font. Guillemots and base
    quotes are critical. Emdash and endash: always. I don't include f ligatures unless
    they're necessary. In a pure display font, numeric ordinals are not likely to
    be used. I'm not sure which languages require single guillemots but they only
    take a few extra seconds."

  body: "I would suggest making separate cap accents at the outset, and building your
    composite accented capitals that way.\r\nIt gives you the ability to have flatter-angled
    cap accents than lower case, and fine-tune the height and angle.\r\nAlso, if you
    later decide to add CE characters, it makes it a lot easier.\r\n"

  body: "OK, this is in FontLab.\r\n\r\nCreate a new glyph for each cap accent: Command
    G > then name it e.g. \"Cap Acute\". No need for a Unicode Number. Start by pasting
    your original acute accent in the new  window, raising it to the correct height,
    than angling it flatter.\r\n\r\nNext open, for instance, your \"Aacute\" glyph
    window.\r\nDelete the present accent.\r\nNow go Glyph > Add Component, and Select
    \"Cap Acute\". Your new accent glyph will be positioned at the right height. \r\n\r\nSo,
    when you have done this for all your cap accent characters, you can compare them
    with each other, and with the lower case accent characters, in the Metrics window.
    And if you decide the cap acute accent isn't quite right, you can adjust it in
    the \"Cap Acute\" window, and the adjustment will be updated automatically in
    all the characters with a cap acute accent.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I would suggest you name your uppercase accents using the .case suffix as
    in acute.case. The alias.dat file has these in its database, and will build the
    component character using the appropriate accent. OR you can edit the alias.dat
    file with your own naming.

  body: "If this is to be a text font, you need a lot of glyphs. In Unicode terms,
    Basic Latin, Latin-1, Latin Extended A, proportional and tabular figures (both
    oldstyle and lining), small capitals, and much of the Unicode \"General Punctuation
    -- be sure to include \"minute\" and \"second\" along with quoteleft, quoteright,
    quotedblleft, and quotedblright.\r\n\r\nIf you have any thought that it might
    be used with scholarly text, I think you need superiors for note calls -- current
    practice is to name them one.super (or some such) with no Unicode, to be used
    with the *superscript* feature you'll also have to write.\r\n\r\nI find by the
    time I'm done with a font, I have about half of Latin Extended B completed, and
    much of Latin Additional -- And even more glyphs unencoded, to be used in features.
    Then you can have fun writing the features and kerning.\r\n\r\nA text font is
    a lot of work, this is just a partial list."

  body: "Nick,\r\n\r\nWe usually use the alphabetic superiors to make words. Usually
    in 17th, 18th and 19th century texts, or in collections of letters where the editor
    wants to preserve some of the scribal nature of those letters. This whole \"preserving
    the scribal nature\" is one of my pet peeves, by the way.\r\n\r\nThey surely don't
    need to be a part of every font, but if you're making one you think might be used
    in books that cover this period, and you're doing some of the letters anyway,
    might as well make a complete set.\r\n\r\nYes, we still use the asterisk-dagger-doubledagger
    etc. sequence. Sometimes we run both, where the original text had footnotes, and
    the commentator also has footnotes. Occasionally, we use the asterisk-dagger sequence
    as the only form of notes, but most modern footnoted texts would repeat the sequence
    too many times on a single page.\r\n\r\nBTW, one of my favorite \"scribal texts\"
    stories involves the Letters of H---- J----, where the editor wanted one, two,
    three, and four strikethrough lines, and the same for underlines. Also a complete
    blot out, but that's easy. Also they occasionally wanted to strike through only
    a comma or period (or parenthesis or whatever), and sometimes a double strikethrough.
    And of course, a usual strikethrough line won't do. Lots of fun all around. They
    kept adding requirements all the way through third proof.\r\n\r\nBut these are
    things a type designer just can't worry about; they don't occur all that often,
    and when they do, are usually require custom work.    "
