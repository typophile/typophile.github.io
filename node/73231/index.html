I wouldn't be happy if I spend 50 bucks and then figure out that it doesn't look great ! 

Do you know where I can find a way to view it and enter a sample text with that font?

I've tested the font with Founders Grotesq but the only difference that I spot is the "g" wich is more ornated and less geometrical. I think that for 50 bucks I'll stick to helvetica but thank you alot anyway.

		<div class="commentbody">If the g is the only diffenerce you can find I don't think you should start as a graphic designer. I don't mean to be rude, but it seems to me like you haven't had enough education on graphic design. The one thing that makes your logo your logo (the e) simply looks wrong. So what your left with is basically nothing. Normally I would have given you some advise on how to make a better logo, but as far as I'm concerned you just got to get the whole idea out of your head.

be wise.</div>

Typography is the subject I less studied in 3 years of self education but I'm about to start a fundementals to typography course this week-end. The self brand that I made is more to show people my capabilities rather than market myself as a fake designer (as I am now, but I'm looking forward to improve) . I am a knowledge/education first kind of person too, please don't get me wrong.

Anyway I expressed myself badly before. I should have said the only BIG difference that I notice is the g but, again, it probably is my untrained eye.

		<div class="commentbody">I would consider changing the face used in the subscript to something more compatible with Helvetica. Also, it might look a bit more subtle if you use the 'pencil i' only once (using it twice feels a bit arbitrary to me) while you could make it more obvious by drawing a chipped top (as on a sharpened octagon-based pencil). It's certainly getting better though.</div>

My comments:
1- I dont like the "river" formed.
2- I think the separation before and after the "+" should be the same between "brand" and "designer"
3- Try something like change the order to "brand + graphic designer", no? If you like and communicate what you want... The pencil is great idea, but need more work...

1996type: you're right , it isn't actually so recognizable at first , I may need some more refinements at the pencil. As for the colored "+" are you sure I should change it in black? It is the second color of my brand identity and I felt it looked really minimal in this composition. Thanks again for commenting and sorry for the misunderstanding we had before


akos.polgardi: Thank you for the tip , the bottom text could be better but I don't know wich font I could use actually. Do you have any suggestions? The i on the pencil will definetly be repeated once . Maybe on the last "i" ? As for the chipped pencil I'm sorry but I couldn't understand how to improve the shape, could you please explain your idea again?
