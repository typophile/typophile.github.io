    weight a bit too bold for this use. \r\n\r\nAdobe generally does a semi-bold and
    a bold. Who uses what for what? When is a bold too bold? \r\n\r\nA side issue:
    it is too bad that there is no kerning. For me the r keeps bumping into i,n, etc. "

    really giving me second thoughts about sponsoring typophile again. Whenever the
    font changes to something new, that means Typophile can keep operating for a while
    longer without completely draining the resources of the site hosts, who do everything
    on their own time. \r\n\r\nDo you really have to snivel about which font was selected
    when it's benefitting everyone for them to appear at all?  Have some perspective;
    this freshens the look of the site periodically, shows off otherwise underexposed
    designs, and keeps the site going. There really isn't anything to complain about.

    a tough crowd, which is what keeps it interesting. I don't think comments on the
    font need to be taken as a criticism of punchcut. I am really glad to see Meta
    Serif like this, and having it be the sponsored font may make me more likely to
    buy it. \r\n\r\nAnd for the record I kicked in some money a few months ago, hope

    best on the huge headlines, such as the <a href="http://www.typophile.com">homepage</a>

    That's the sweet spot for this setting i think.
