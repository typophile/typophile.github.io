  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A feeling of excitement abounds in the world of type — and for good reason. Consumers have never been more conscious of type as they are now, and more and more people are taking graphic design into their own hands. I believe the digital type industry is nearing a tipping point much like the music industry did nearly a decade ago, which is why I created [[http://fontslice.com|FontSlice]]. In the year 2000, a typical music purchase was around $15.00 — the average price of a CD. That all changed in 2003 when Apple launched the iTunes Store. In six short years, the music industry nearly doubled in size, going from 800 million dollars to nearly 1.6 <em>billion</em> dollars in sales.</p>
<p>![](/images/old-images/music sales_4589.JPG)</p>
<p>By significantly reducing the average transaction cost, the barrier to consumption was lowered, which caused the actual size of the market to expand. At a recent TypeCon, Roger Black suggested that the type industry might evolve in a similar fashion; his last slide read <strong>99 Cents</strong>, though few designers would place such a low value on the tremendous effort that goes into creating a new typeface. Amazingly, the iTunes revolution was accomplished without fundamentally changing the dollar value of the music itself, since the cost of a digital album was about the same as that of its physical equivalent. The music industry followed the path of least resistance; artists would continue to produce music the way they always had — in albums — while Apple worried about the details of dividing and distributing the content to consumers.</p>
<p>FontSlice serves a similar purpose to the type industry. Consumers are able to purchase only the glyphs they need for a particular project, whether it be a few letters or an entire character range. This allows consumers to incrementally purchase fonts via multiple transactions, paying for each glyph individually according to a nonlinear pricing model; the first glyph might be $1.00, the second $0.95, the third $0.90, and so on. After each transaction, the user is able to download an abridged version of the font containing only the glyphs they&rsquo;ve purchased. If the user eventually purchases every glyph in the font, the total amount paid will simply equal the retail price of the font. This pricing model encourages consumers to make repeated purchases until a font is complete, much like iTunes users have incentive to complete an album after purchasing several tracks. Using this system, type designers can continue producing fonts the way they always have — in standard font files — while FontSlice worries about the details of dividing and distributing the font to consumers.</p>
<p>FontSlice has come a long way in the past few months — the patent application is filed, the website is developed, and the support system is in place. In fact, there&rsquo;s only one thing missing — fonts. We&rsquo;d like to see every font available on FontSlice, and we&rsquo;re ready to listen to the type community to make sure that happens. Let us know what you think about FontSlice in the comments below. We&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about FontSlice or if you&rsquo;re interested in a distribution agreement, email me at [[mailto:david@fontslice.com|david@fontslice.com]].</p>

<p>Dave, you&rsquo;re absolutely right. Implementing this <em>was</em> a massive task. It took months of careful programming to create the algorithm that produces abridged font files. In a nutshell, the algorithm analyzes each line of the original font file and determines what type of information it contains. The algorithm won&rsquo;t even consider altering the line unless it contains spline data, which is the only data within a font file that is absolutely necessary to reproduce the shape of a particular glyph. If a user has rights to a certain glyph, then the spline data is left untouched. If a user doesn&rsquo;t have rights to a certain glyph, then the spline data is removed. All other information (including kerning and OpenType data) is left untouched. As long as the user has rights to the necessary glyphs, all OpenType functionality will remain intact.</p>

<p>You make a great point about display type; FontSlice will certainly be the distributor of choice when users are typesetting display copy, which often only comprises a few words. However, assuming the user is able to predict which character ranges would be required for a particular application, there&rsquo;s no reason why FontSlice wouldn&rsquo;t be used in applications involving larger amounts of text. The abridged fonts produced by the FontSlice algorithm are identical in every way to the original file, save the missing spline data for unlicensed glyphs. Like any font file, they can be installed on your operating system and used in any software application; there&rsquo;s no need for EPS files.</p>

<p>In the graphics world, we frequently have just a few minutes to make client changes and provide new proofs.

<p>Sometimes the client is sitting in the office waiting on the changed proof because the timing is so critical to them. No one wants to tell a client they will have to wait; it&rsquo;s not good for business.</p>
<p>Given just this one issue, I don&rsquo;t believe I would take advantage of this service. I would continue to buy the complete font or family.</p>

<p>Thanks for the great question. Depending on your internet connection, it should only take about 15 seconds to find and download an upgraded version of an abridged font. When you enter the new headline, FontSlice will automatically determine which glyphs you&rsquo;ve already purchased and which glyphs you haven&rsquo;t. The system will also allow you to maintain an account balance, so you won&rsquo;t have to pull out your credit card every time you purchase or upgrade an abridged font. When you install the upgraded version, it will immediately overwrite the previous version and you&rsquo;ll be ready to go.</div>

<p>James, great point. We&rsquo;ll be doing everything in our power to make sure an outage like that never happens to FontSlice.

<p>Hey Thomas. In our testing, we&rsquo;ve never run into a problem with font caching. We&rsquo;ve mostly tested Adobe and Microsoft applications on Mac and Windows platforms, though. It seems that a few people are concerned about this issue, so we will definitely be doing more thorough testing before we launch. Thanks for the insight!</div>
