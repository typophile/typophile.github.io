  body: ITC Bookman Medium is going to get you pretty close, although there are a
    few quirks in the logo like the tail on the lowercase 'e' and slightly narrower
    proportions in general that you might need to tweak

  body: Thanks. I did use Bookman but it was a major project to recreate the logo.
    I know I;ve seen the actual font years ago. Thanks again. If anyone does know
    the font I'd love to know.
