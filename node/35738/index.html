Having survived that mess, I can really appreciate when a conference is great. So I just want to thank Tamye, everyone at S{o}TA, all the volunteers, the people from SVC and Cornish, the sponsors, and the speakers for making Typecon 2007 the best vacation I’ve had in years.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It was my first one and I didn&rsquo;t miss a talk. For the most part, each talk offered something thought-provoking, stimulating, informative or funny (sometimes all of the above). Just two highlights for me were:1) Bill Hill&rsquo;s (Microsoft) inspiring talk about the Digital Renaissance we&rsquo;re all part of. If this is the guy Bill Gates wants to keep dreaming about the future of digital typography, then I may have to revise my feelings about that company. 2) The talk by Mexican Font designers Gabriel Martínez Meave and Leonardo Vázquez Conde was an informative and eye-opening look about the history and vitality of the Mexican type community. I want to learn a lot more about those designers.</p>
<p>Tamye and the gang, including &lsquo;Stewf&rsquo; Coles, did a great job of planning it and keeping it moving right along. The Typophile Film Festival 4 was sensational. &lsquo;Helvetica&rsquo;, the movie, is a must see if you get the chance.</p>
<p>It was terrific to finally meet so many Typophiles I have only &lsquo;seen&rsquo; online before, but we really need a better way to spot each other. I have no idea how many of you I missed because I couldn&rsquo;t read the last names on the badges unless you were inside someone&rsquo;s personal space. That was really my only complaint.</p>

<p>What was surprising was the amount of people who have never even heard of Typophile. There were a couple of local AIGA guys here, pretty nice guys, who knew next to nothing about this forum.</p>
<p>But again, the amount of people who DO participate here was also surprising. Most of the type designers participate, exceptions being people like Matthew Carter and John Downer.</p>
<p>The other thing that was surprising was how familiar and friendly the entire type community is with each other. Competitors and rivals are friends and compatriots, all with the twofold goals of learning and having fun. Newcomers are treated as if old friends, and even the old-timers have time to sit and chat with students who haven&rsquo;t even had a full year&rsquo;s worth of design.</p>
<p>Bravo!</p>

In fact, I told them that, and suggested they do one on the palaeography, one on the more recent history, and a new one (in a few years) about the current wave of digital type designers from Mexico. Their presentation was amazing.</p>
<p>Thanks to them and to everyone who traveled far (and endured tiresome travel delays) to participate, and especially to the SOTA board who all spent incredible energy and time to make things exciting and informative. This really was the best TypeCon I&rsquo;ve been to.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Adding my thanks to the list &ndash; not having been able to go to the last two, and not having stayed at the hotel for 2004&rsquo;s in SF, I really got the full flavor this year. I left inspired to rededicate myself to focusing more on the type aspect of my design work, making it more the star than the supporting cast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to me how many non-type-designers who were there. Not being a type designer myself, it&rsquo;s nice to connect with people who are in the same boat as I am. (Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love meeting and reconnecting with all the type designers as well!)</p>
<p>Highlights: Gabriel and Leo (a really stellar presentation), Nick Shinn (the <em>Globe and Mail</em> type &amp; layout are so cool), the Film Fest (plus Joe &amp; Jared&rsquo;s excellent party DJ-ing), the eccentric genius Robert Bringhurst (he makes me want to be a linguist), and Marian Bantjes (I don&rsquo;t care what Bringhurst says, that program was brilliant), among many others. Kudos as well to tech giant JP who kept so many things running smoothly.</p>
<p>Biggest disappointment: Downer kept his shirt on the whole time during the party.</p>
<p>I hope I can make it to Buffalo next year. But my biggest wish is that Tamye, Kent, Tiff, Stewf, Shu, Jon, et al, get to actually enjoy the fruits of their labors and see more of the presentations themselves.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I finally got back home yesterday midday. &ldquo;Red-eye&rdquo; flights are aptly named, and I was practically useless the rest of the day, barely managing to unpack and sort my mail. But I was able to get 12+ hours of sleep last night and feel nearly back to normal now (though I&rsquo;m probably still running a sleep deficit).</p>
<p>It was great to connect with some new faces this year. Reading through the various follow-up threads, however, I realize that there are many Typophiles that I didn&rsquo;t manage to meet, which is a bummer. I realize that when I&rsquo;m very busy I can unintentionally put off a vibe of aloofness or unapproachability; I hope that next year, y&rsquo;all will take a moment to grab me and introduce yourselves.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get to sit through any presentations in their entirety, but I did manage to catch decent snippets of a good many, and I have to say that I think this year&rsquo;s program may have been among the best overall that I can recall. Tamye (with help from the local committee) did a stellar job putting it all together.</p>
<p><cite>Stephen: Kent “Linchpin” Lew.</cite></p>
<p>&ldquo;Linchpin&rdquo; . . . I like that. Thanks for the acknowledgment. It was a real pleasure getting to work closely together again with you.</p>
<p>The SoTA board is a volunteer, working board. We each invest a lot of personal time and energy to present a professional caliber conference every year. I may have been a bit more visible than many this year, but my colleagues all work hard throughout the conference, and I extend my personal thanks to all of them &ndash; Allan Haley, Jon Coltz, Tiffany Wardle de Sousa, Stephen &ldquo;Stewf&rdquo; Coles, Shu Yun Lai, James Grieshaber, Ilene Strizver, and Mark Jamra. Two of our number were conspicuously absent, for unavoidable personal reasons, but David Hollingsworth and Laurence Penney were supporting from afar, and I look forward to having them with us again in Buffalo.</p>
<p>There were two non-Board members who contributed greatly in managing important aspects of this year&rsquo;s Con, and I want to make sure they get due recognition &ndash; Michelle Hill was our volunteer coordinator extraordinaire (as well as a great personal support to me throughout) and Deb Gonet managed the pre-conference workshops as well as a number of other important things throughout the weekend which would have otherwise fallen through the cracks.</p>
<p>The local volunteers were indeed top-notch. Most were students with little knowledge or even interest in type (although I&rsquo;m certain that has changed now), but they were smart, enthusiastic, and hard-working. There were too many to thank individually here. But among the handful of non-students who lent a big volunteer hand, I want to personally thank Jane Jolkovski (from Monotype) and Jeff Barlow (typography chair from the Seattle AIGA chapter).</p>
<p>TypeCon may only be one week out of the year, but it takes at least a year of nearly constant preparation to put together. The board members may work hard during the week of, but our extraordinary (and seemingly indefatigable) Executive Director Tamye Riggs works equally hard all year round. None of it would be remotely possible without all her amazing efforts. Major kudos once again to Tamye.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re working from the inside, it can be hard to maintain any real perspective, so I think I speak on behalf of all the organizers when I say that we take great satisfaction in hearing about the wonderful experiences of the attendees. So keep &lsquo;em coming.</p>
<p>&ndash; Kent.</p>

I can only think of a handful of other conferences that have been as good or better in some respects, and only one or two that were as consistently interesting or enjoyable.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree. This TypeCon Seattle was one of the best conferences I have assisted to. I enjoyed many presentations, specially the one by Gabriel and Leonardo. This is the first time I see Leonardo speaking, but I have seen Gabriel many times: I am not surprised, Gabriel always works hard to give the best of himself, and he has great ideas too. I really hope to see both in many future presentations.</p>
<p>Congratulations and thanks to Tamye, the volunteers, sponsors, board, and every one who work hard to make this happen. See you in Buffalo.</p>

I just wanted to say I had a great time at the conference and was thrilled to meet those of you I knew(-ish) and those of you I hadn&rsquo;t known of before. The conference seemed to go off without a hitch from my perspective, and that&rsquo;s no small feat, so kudos to the organizers and volunteers.</p>
<p>I find the type community to be more egalitarian in general: humbler, in a way, than the design community. It seems to lack the strong cliques and hierarchies that become evident at design conferences.</p>
<p>I liked the moments of heady technicality which get sprinkled throughout. It was an interesting mix of the handmade, the finely crafted and the truly geeky.</p>
<p>A friend of mine remarked on the lack of type for motion or other non-print based media, and I think it&rsquo;s a valid point. The design community is notorious for ignoring that which doesn&rsquo;t appear in print, so maybe Typecon could keep a step ahead and keep that in mind for the future.</p>
<p>Speaking of which I wanted to thank the folks at Sansrival (I hope that&rsquo;s right) for the terrific motion work on The Thing.</p>

<p>More web content would be good too.
Problem is, it&rsquo;s always tougher to get type users to present &ndash; except for the music poster guys, off course :-)</p>
<p>For TypeCon 2002, I spent a lot of time courting various art directors &ndash; magazine designers, packaging designers, advertising art directors, without much success. No matter they may be great typographers, type is still not big enough on their radar (or I wasn&rsquo;t) to warrant joining the speaker list.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I would like to invite my fellow Typophiles to join myself &amp; Checko on the photo team.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t want to shoot photos we could still use help processing &amp; posting. I say this because my possibly deluded hope is that we can get a good hunk of the photos up in the same day/evening during TypeCon Buffalo.</p>
<p>Mark, thanks for the link. It will be a while before I am in that league.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I too had a wonderful time at the conference and really appreciate the efforts of all involved. Great job!
After I sent some of my photos to about half a dozen people, I got tired of it and just put a bunch up on my old, bloated website and thought some others might enjoy them too.

<p>The &ldquo;hottie&rdquo; with you and Joshua, by the way, is [[Zara Evens]].</p>
