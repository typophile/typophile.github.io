    Face on Typophile is a very unique way for designers to showcase their work in
    a dynamic environment, very different from your standard specimen. The typeface
    will be changing on a regular basis, so get used to it :) This feature has always
    been part of the design (since the redesign of 2005), but we are now taking it
    by the horns and have placed a selection of fonts into rotation.\r\n\r\nWe are
    really excited to bring a fresh face to Typophile every so often, and hopefully
    you will enjoy seeing some new favorites splashed all over your screen. If anyone
    has interest in taking advantage of this feature, let us know!\r\n\r\ntypophile@punchcut.com"

  body: Posts are still in Beorcana. But anyway - I like this feature. I kinda loved
    to stay on the homepage when Mercury Display was the featured face. Keep up and
    thanks to punchcut.

    while. Maybe now is a good time. Nice lookin' font there James! That was a heck
    of a good looking ad in the Typecon schedule as well!

  body: I love the idea of the featured face (even tho this one isn't my cup of tea)
    but had hoped it would rotate more often than it has. We had Beorcana for a long
    time. Is it a lot of work to change it - I'm not a programmer - or is it simple
    code?

    is the face going to rotate? If there are enough entries, then I'd suggest  one
    month between changes.\r\n\r\nThis is a good way to expose members to new faces.
    (Is someone going to keep a record, perhaps in the wiki, of featured faces? That
    would be useful in the future when you remember a font from a few years back,
    but can't remember the name.)"

  body: "The fonts being displayed are from type designers and foundries that are
    directly (financially) supporting Typophile in exchange for what we think is some
    nice, blanketed exposure throughout Typophile. So, we owe a thanks in a more explicit
    way to [[Carl Crossgrove]] and [[Typeco]] for helping out in that fashion (ahem,
    buy their fonts). Our aim is to have the sponsored face rotate on a very regular
    (monthly) basis. \r\n\r\nSo, just when you'll be getting used to reading Super
    Duty, you can expect us to change it.\r\n\r\nPlease email typophile [at] punchcut
