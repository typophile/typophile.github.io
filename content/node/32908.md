  & Green: Socialism and the Environment</em></a>.  Please bear in mind that I have
  no formal training in graphic design or typography, and this is the first book cover
  I've designed.  Expect elementary mistakes and faux pas, and please help me correct
  them."

  body: "I like the image a <i>lot</i>. \r\n\r\n[sermon]That plus the fact that you're
    putting the effort into getting the type looking equally nice is a poignant illustration
    of how anarchism (compared to socialism) will never catch on until more anarchists
    stop using DIYism as an excuse for aesthetic laziness.[/sermon]\r\n\r\nThe font
    used for the subtitle (Courier?) feels cold, mechanical, technological -- not
    at all like what I presume the book intends by either socialism or ecology. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    three typefaces seems too much here. I would simplify and use one for the title
    and one for everything else (including the \"Socialist Press\" bit), though in
    the latter case, different styles of the same face could be fine.\r\n\r\nWith
    that in mind, perhaps you need a type face that looks attractive as a display
    (for the subtitle) yet can be used for the text on the back. I've been rather
    interested in <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-42-sebastian\">Sebastian</a>,
    which has something of an organic look."

  body: "The subtitle is in Computer Modern Teletype and the other text is in Andale
    Sans.  Now that you mention it, I agree that CM is perhaps a bit too cold; I think
    I used it mostly because the various Sans typefaces I tried looked odd.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    I don't think we have the budget to spend \u20AC200 or even \u20AC30 on a typeface
    for a single book cover.  As this is a volunteer effort, we've been limiting ourselves
    to the fonts that come with LaTeX, the standard PostScript fonts, and free fonts.
    \ Do you think something in one of those categories would be appropriate?  (Computer
    Modern Sans, Helvetica, Avant Garde, Bitstream Vera Sans, etc.)"

  body: "Couple of things on the type on the back, remove double word spaces (this
    is a hangover from typewriters) and replace the em dash (\u2014) with space en
    dash space ( \u2013 ) this use is more normal for UK publishing. You could also
    spend some time cleaning up the rag (the non-aligned margin), possibly by increasing
    the width of the column and turning over some of the shorter words, the idea is
    to get the righthand margin making a smooth (not necessarily straight) line. The
    red of the cover seems a little more organic than socialist, however given the
    subject why not keep it.\r\n\r\nWhat does the interior look like?\r\n\r\nThere
    are some quality free* typefaces linked here, some freebies on the net are of
    variable quality.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/wiki/FAQ_Free\r\n\r\n*check the permitted
    uses.\r\nTim"
