  body: That's a pretty general question and therefore hard to answer - for me it's
    how the type sits on the page that matters, how it's organized, how easy to read,
    and to follow. How they organize different bits of info. I get more bothered by
    magazines that don't have a TOC right up front than by differing formats.

    a bunch of ads to figure out where to find something.  I know the ad guys love
    me doing it but it has the opposite effect on me.  I will never buy stuff from
    those folks so put the damn TOC in the first spread and be done with it!\r\n\r\nSorry
    Patty, didn't mean to go off on that but you are very right about it.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Page sizes of magazines are affected by standard paper sizes and web widths.
    Typical point-of-purchase racks also follow suit. The user needs something portable
    fitting in a briefcase and storable on shelves and easily readable on a plane
    or subway car. The typical mag today seems about right for all this.\r\nFor my
    tastes, most magazines could use some more white space, they just look too crammed
    to me.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I'm sorry but I'm still not that clear what you're asking. Do you want to
    know what trim size we like? For me, something I can fit in my handbag without
    folding - therefore no bigger than about 9 x 12. Preferably even 8 1/2 x 11. I
    like stapled rather than perfect bound because it's easier to fold backwards but
    I guess that depends on page count.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of magazine are you working
    on. If it's an art/fashion/architecture/design/style you could get away with a
    larger trim, if it's a literary/reading mag I'd stick with letter sized. \r\n\r\nIs
    this helpful?"

  body: "\"How do you think page dimensions of a magazine affect the user?\"\r\n\r\nIf
    it's too big, it kind of flops over in the magazine holder in the bathroom, and
    then gets all warped and wrinkly.\r\n\r\nIf it's too small, then the magazine
    gets too think, and can't even fit in the magazine rack so ends up on the floor
    where people drip all over it after getting out of the shower.\r\n\r\nIt's a fine
    balance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I feel that that the digest sizes are supposed to be more portable, but end
    up a PITA. They are too big for pockets, to small to keep track of. Any smaller
    than Nat'l Geo is too small. And I want bigger pics. (Nat'l Geo also the min.
    for that.) The mainstream approx. size suits me, because I can roll it up, or
    shove it in a notebook if i need to take it to go (since its thinner). Oversized,
    I personally love, except that they almost never choose thicker cover stock, so
    they end up to floppy, or extra-floppy if they go thin to keep the weight similar
    to the average size. Nevertheless, if the oversized ones would be a hair more
    rigid, Id prefer them becoming dominant, as they usually look better.\r\n\r\nHurried,
    ATM, but does that answer ya?\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.chozcunningham.com\">Choz

  body: Anything smaller than Rolling Stone. I know its been around for years, but
    that size makes storing and transporting ANNOYING. Sort of like using ALL CAPS
    to make my point. ;)
