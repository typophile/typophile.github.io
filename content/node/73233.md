body: "Hi,\r\nThis is font made by Dalton Maag for ThyssenKrupp. It looks great in
  long texts. Can someone recommend similar font? I thought about obvious choices
  like Fago or Stroudley. But they do not have this \u201EDINish feel\u201D. Stroudley
  is almost perfect but its regular weight is a way too thick for my taste. Do you
  have any suggestions?"

  body: "I do not like DIN as a body typeface. This font is like a perfect marriage
    between technicality of DIN and humanistic feel. Another advantage of this typeface
    is it's narrow. Not condensed but narrow enough to work great in long documents.
    But as I see I am too picky:)\r\n\r\nAhs, why not Fago? Because fago is insanely
    expensive."

  body: Not so Din-ish but my [[http://www.terminaldesign.com/Fonts/#/ClearviewTextRegular|ClearviewText]]
    works great as a text face. John Berry writing in [[http://www.creativepro.com/article/dot-font-the-x-appeal-of-james-montalbano|Creative
    Pro]] commented that ClearviewOne, its Type1 predecessor "reads astonishingly
    well as a text face".

    FF Unit above, maybe also look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_sanuk_2_ot/\">FF
    Sanuk</a> or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_clan_ot/\">FF
    Clan</a>. \r\nYou might also like <a href=\"http://typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=NDY1\">Breuer

    but it does work for text and is a very nice font."

  body: Stroudley seems to be a strange crossover of Frutiger Condensed and Vectora.
    If you like it I suggest having a look at these two.
