body: I've always said "gill" as in "gill of a fish." However, a fellow student always
  pronounces it like the girls name "Jill". Which is correct?

    let's look at that first word, \"sans\". According to the Wiktionary <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sans\">sans</a>
    comes from Middle English and was borrowed from Old French. By the way, the word
