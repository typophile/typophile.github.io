  body: "If it is a PC, the font should be in the Windows/fonts folder in windows
    explorer. If there is a way to get it there besides draggin it, it is lost in
    the recesses of my morass...I mean mind.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing from the question
    that you don't have a font installing program, so I am dredging this info up from
    long, long, ago. So I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nMany people who use a lot of fonts,
    have a program like Typograf, ATM, Suitcase, etc. Something free from Linotype
    is popular with the Mac people."

  body: "Well, that is an interesting question to ask here. Most often fonts downloaded
    from the internet are illegal copies or of obviously bad quality. Both are frowned
    upon here.\r\n\r\nBut if you want to know, as always, JFGI (just f***ing google
    it). \r\nhttp://simplythebest.net/fonts/how_to_install_fonts.html\r\nor\r\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/314960/\r\nor\r\njust
    copy and paste the file into C:\\Windows\\Fonts.\r\n\r\nIt will automatically
    appear in any windows program, after you restart the program.\r\n\r\nI am assuming
    you are using a windows OS."

    fonts are also downloaded these days."

  body: "With such a newbie question, I can see why it would be easy to assume something
    like that. I didn't know there was an ethics issue until someone politely explained
    it in a.b.f.\r\n\r\nI wish I knew who that was, because he was sort of a font
    saint, compared to the reactions of others whose bitterness seems to have poisoned
    their spirits.\r\n\r\nKind of like how movies sometimes justify cheating on your
    wife by showing what a jerk she is, those people make it easy to justify snagging
    commercial fonts (if that's the kinds of jerks that make them).\r\n\r\nBack to
    the movies for a second, they didn't bother with the justification in Fatal Attraction,
    and that was when Ann Archer was at her prime. I was so pissed at Michael Douglas
    (Glenn Close?) that I had to leave the theatre when I saw where it was going.\r\n\r\nSame
    thing with the latest Woodie Allen movie. I didn't care what happened to that
    self-absorbed moron. When I saw where that one was going I had better things to
    do.\r\n\r\nExcuse the derail, but this thread was as good a one to sidetrack on
    as I am bound to see.\r\n; )"

  body: Just DL the font, then go to start>control panel>fonts>file>install new fonts>find
    where you DL'ed the font too and select it>install and it'll show up in word np.  You
    also might have to unzip the font perhaps first.
