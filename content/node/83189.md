body: Say your thinnest lines are 3/1000 em. Now, I assume some hinting might help
  keep the them visibile, but how small can it teoretically be printed before they
  vanish?

  body: "Equation too complex. :-)  And I'm not good enough to know it anyway.\r\n\r\nMostly
    I guess paper and ink/toner qualities. But those are pretty\r\nimpossible to quantify.
    You gotta field-test for specific conditions.\r\nOr: compare an existing actual
    output on a given repro technology\r\nto the font used (if you can get yours hands
    on it).\r\n\r\nBut then there's also human acuity, which\r\nmight be inferior
    to the repro's resolution.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Lucas de Groot has a font called The Thinnest, whose stems are 1 UPM (where
    UPM is 1000 units). So if you print it at 1000 points, the stem will be 1 point
    width. Since you are talking about a font three times that width, you can go three
    times smaller than that.\r\n\r\nSo I think the question is: how thin a line can
    be printed in any given device? Half point? A quarter?"

  body: I habitually use quarter-point rules in my layouts, and 0.15 points strokes
    to compensate to registration errors. So I think that the visibility threshold
    is beyond that.

  body: 'As far as visual limits I read that to detect a white bar between two black
    bars it needs to be a visual span of one minute (1/60th of a degree,) and that
    at normal reading distance for printed matter that amounts to .0041 inch, which
    is a bit over a quarter of a typographic point, and I believe the tolerance that
    Linotype used in drawing type in the metal days. I would guess that we could see
    a thinner black line against white than that, but it''s starting to get ridiculous
    around those dimensions. My guess would be that printing technology is more of
    a limit on thin lines than the eye is.  '

    The question, as posed, is not different from \"how big should the x height be?\"
    with no other information provided."

    smallest pixel is 14 mu, which is 14/1000 of a millimeter.\r\nI do wonder if this
