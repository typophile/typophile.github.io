body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m currently working on a detailed typeface research project
  for my Typography class and I need to know any information anybody may have on the
  Californian FB fonts. <BR> <BR>I learned so far that it was designed/redrawn by
  David Berlow based off from Goudy&#39;s California Old Style. <BR> <BR>Any info,
  facts, etc on Californian FB will help... thank you.

  body: Giampa the Great, thank you very much for your reply and your offer to help.
    <BR> <BR>As of now I really don&#39;t have a core question, I&#39;m just interested
    in as much details and information about the font as possible. Anything you know
    about the typeface will definitely be very helpful to me. <BR> <BR>I apologize
    for not being able to be specific about my own question. Thank you again.

  body: Californian &#44; &#34;the type&#34; <BR> <BR>Is Hrant&#39;s favorite Goudy
    Type face. Mine too. Designed by Frederic Goudy for the University of California.
    <BR> <BR>Lanston is the proprietor of &#34;the godly&#34; version of this face,
    made by Goudy&#39;s own hand at Deepdene. I beg you visit the Katskill Mountains
    in the fall. A sight you will never forget. <BR> <BR>Go see the remains of Goudy&#39;s
    studio at Deepdene. <BR> <BR>My further advice about this face is to ask those
    at P22 if they ever plan to release this face.

    the face immensely. Whatever Hrant likes, you are &#34;heath advised&#34; to like
    the opposite. <BR> <BR>Looking at me with that eye of yours Hrant? <BR> <BR>Merry
    Christmas and all &#34;that rot&#34;.

  body: Alan, you will want to get hold of a copy of Goudy&#39;s book <i>Typologia</i>,
    which focuses on the making of the original Californian type. There is a partial
    electronic version of this book online <a href="http://www.typeart.com/reference-books/typologia/typo-contents.html">here</a>.
    <BR> <BR>On page 208 of Bringhurst&#39;s <i>The elements of typographic style</i>
    there is a useful comparison of FB Californian with the earlier revival, ITC Berkeley.

    the original patterns are part of the Lanston-P22 archives, we will definitley
    be issuing a very accurate digitization of the roman and italic.'

  body: Sadly, there is not much surviving to make up the archives. The Goudy Californian
    Patterns are the gem of the &#34;collection&#34;. The small amount of material
    there is will reside at the P22 offices in Buffalo. I will gladly entertain any
    inquiries for research on all levels.
