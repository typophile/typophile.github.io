    distracted by the random inclusion/omission of \"The\" when I decided to just
    read it from top to bottom. Then I saw your trick.\r\n\r\nI think a solution would
    be to have fewer styles. Don't do the italic <em>and</em> the negative indent.
    Keeping one weight and style throughout will probably do a better job in showing
    your layout idea as well as keeping it readable.\r\n\r\nLastly, the proportion
    of the copy to the page feels a little large and unwieldy.\r\n\r\nMinion's not
    a bad choice for this, but let see how it evolves after more feedback...  "

  body: 'Yes it''s not quite clear whether this is two columns or negative indent.  You
    want the words STUDENT CONCERNS REPORT to stand out. But they are also part of
    the text if i got the idea. My suggestion: instead of using marginal text use
    a very bold (ultra or black something) sans face to stress them. In addition,
    you could use <em>some</em> negative indent, but not the whole word, but maybe
    you needn''t. Andreas'

  body: "Hey all. Thanks a bunch for the feedback! I have two new specs. They will
    probably need some additional tidying, but they carry the idea successfully. (That
    is to say, they continue my thinking.) Links in first post!\r\n\r\nFontgrube:
    Even though I wanted \"Student Concerns Report\" to stand out, I reasoned that
    removing those words from the block of text was more or less unnecessary. The
    title is repeated several times. EVENTUALLY, one way or another, the audience
    will be able to tell what the publication is.\r\n\r\nWilliam: I've streamlined
    the text. Now, the reader must begin where all good English texts start\u2014from
    the top (of the text).\r\n\r\nTerminal: I've gotten rid of the negative indent
    in one example, so I don't think a change in size is necessary. I have increased
    the weight in both instances, as you'll see.\r\n\r\nOprion: Amen. The logo is
    fine given that the wavy look could be reasoned as the designer's \"intention.\"
    The text is unsalvageable. But changing the logo is not in my purview at this
    moment. "

    with.\r\n\r\nIt seems a bit like you're trying to very cleverly solve a difficult
    problem that you don't need to have. Which makes it seem over-designed to me.
    But maybe I'm just not getting it. What is the point of the repetition?\r\n\r\nBTW
    on the spine, why capitalize one instance of \xABthe\xBB but not the other?"

  body: "I am attempting to make a visually appealing cover with just typography.\r\n\r\nIt
    does require a little bit of flashiness for success. It isn't intuitive per se;
    the repetition does not support the meaning, only the design. The guiding light
    for the project has been \"credibility\" and as a designer, I have taken this
    to mean a cover that includes a type of minimal elegance using what is already
    present\u2014in this case, typography.\r\n\r\nI am reconsidering it though. I
    am straddling a fine line between boring and over-designed. I am trying hard to
    make purposive design, but it sits dully on the page and who will that serve but
    unresponsive conventions?\r\n\r\nStill, a great much to consider.\r\n\r\nThank
    you all!"

  body: "Mr Deux,\r\n\r\nI think you are way off the mark. Your cover does not need
    to contain \"flashiness\" or \"repetition\".\r\n\r\nMinion is primarily a test
    face. Perhaps it is not the ideal font to use in this design. \r\n\r\nThere are
    a lot of ways for you to solve this typographic design without resorting over
    wrought design devices.\r\n\r\nHow about taking the basic information you have
    to communicate and compose it in a simple and straight forward manner, paying
    attention to line breaks and logical clusters of information? Use scale, contrast
    and white space to create a bit tension on the page.\r\n\r\nThis isn't brain surgery.
    (Although it might be a bit of rocket science)."

    (since it isn't immediately clear what's going on) and getting bored after reading
    the word \"concerns\" about 12 times.\r\n\r\n What about an alternate design that
    emphasizes \"the student concerns report\" by presenting the phrase in an interesting
    way, or creating a pattern out of it, or whatever, and de-emphasizes the other
    words (year, author, etc) by placing them separately (without repetition) just
    one place on the page, perhaps in smaller type? "
