    closer to <a href=\"http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/the-foundry-typefaces/sans/params/foundry-sterling/opentype/level-1/demi\">Foundry
    Sterling</a>, but I'm not completely convinced."

    a bit off too. Foundry Sterling looks very close too, possibly matching (hard
    to tell with no type tester on Foundry's website). As usual, that's probably easier
    with a larger glyph set and the sample origin."
