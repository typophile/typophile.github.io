    not read, you will find something that says you can't. Generally the licence is
    sold to the OS maker for that use only, which does not make it free.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    if you want to buy an OS for your other person, you can give that away. :)\r\n"

  body: "If they come pre-installed why would you need to redistribute them? I can
    think of some reasons, but would like to know yours. You'll find many system fonts
    posted around the web - that doesn't mean that they are posted legally.\r\n"

  body: Unfortunately the issue is outdated systems... surprise, surprise. i guess
    Lucida comes with Windows 2000, XP and beyond, but not in prior versions. Just
    wondering if i could distribute it to those that are running pre-windows 2000,
    my guess is no, but wanted to get real answers. do either of you know about Lucida
    Sans Unicode?

  body: "A bit more context would help - are you looking to just get the font on antiquated
    machines in your office? If so licenses from B&H or one of their distributors
    may be all you need. If you need to distribute the font outside of your company,
    say with a product you've developed, then things will get more expensive but again
    B&H or one of their agents (eg. Ascender) would be able to help. \r\n\r\nLucida
    Sans Unicode - <A HREF=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FID=17&FNAME=Lucida+Sans+Unicode&FVER=2.00\">products
    that include it</A>\r\n \r\n"
