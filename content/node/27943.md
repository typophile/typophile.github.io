  logos, the site has gone to some minor(?) design updates.\r\n\r\nThe new logos have
  been designed directly on-screen (after some preliminary draft scetches on paper)
  and 3 different stamps have been created (just because I was curious about the result).\r\n\r\nSee
  the logos and some pictures of the stamps in the design > logos section (logo #15)."
