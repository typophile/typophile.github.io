    have to hunt.

    American Knockoffs.  <BR>Rivoli is the &#34;American Knockoff&#34; of Locarno?

  body: 'No Stephen, not that one. I&#39;m again working from the Solotype Catalog,
    which lists two Rivoli Initials. One of them is your RR tyepface, the other Jared&#39;s
    match except for something I&#39;d missed earlier '

  body: Following Harold Lohner&#39;s pointer to an original font name<br> of Zierbuchstaben,
    I discovered that Dieter Steffmann&#39;s<br> fonts &#40;PC only&#41; are back
    online &#40;Hooray! says I&#41; and he<br> offers a version called <a href="http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/index.htm"
    target=_top>Koch Antiqua Zierbuchstaben</a>. <BR> <BR>Lohner states that Koch&#39;s
    Zierbuchstaben was designed<br> as a companion to Koch Antiqua and Steffman&#39;s
    font<br> incorporates Koch Antiqua&#39;s lower case. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, Steffman&#39;s
    version is rougher and he seems<br> to have neglected the &#39;I&#39;. <BR> <BR>So
    what do you think Jared? Does your image simply<br> incorporate an alternate &#39;U&#39;?

    an alternate &#39;U&#39;?</i> <BR>I think Mike can claim this one: most definitely
    alternate  <BR>&#39;U&#39; cuz everything else matches. Congrats, Mr. Freiman.
    <BR>What a team!'
