  body: 'It&#39;s a slightly customized version of <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?1NO">Perpetua
    Titling</a>. The main modification seems to be the &#34;1&#34; that looks more
    like an &#34;I&#34; &#40;which is harmonious with the Oldstyle Figures&#41;, and,
    on the 10p stamp on the bottom row, a more diagonal stress on the 0. The '

    numerals from Gill himself, not type.

  body: Thanks all, <BR> <BR>It seems like Perpetua Titling as Raph said, but &#39;2&#39;
    and some characters is not really like that. So, if they are hand drawn and never
    released, it really is a shame for me, it is really a great font. <BR> <BR>P.S.
    The letter Richard posted is so hard to read for me as I am not a English-speaking
    person. <BR> <BR>-----------------  <BR>TyPO  <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;  <BR>-----------------

  body: Hmm, I meant to post a fonts.com &#40;Agfa Monotype&#41; link to Perpetua
    Titling, but for some reason indentifont is what showed up. The Agfa Monotype
    version is a lot closer - I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the figures were in fact
    based on the work Gill did for the stamps, as opposed to simply being adapted
    from the main Perpetua font.

  body: Sorry about that, Ralph. I changed the link. Identifont&#39;s samples <BR>are
    often much better than fonts.com&#39;s so I was trying to be <BR>helpful - but
    it looks like i mis-stepped here as the <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205547"
    target="_blank">fonts.com sample</a>  <BR>is much darker. I don&#39;t know if
    the font data is actually different  <BR>&#40;it shouldn&#39;t be&#41; or if the
    change in weight is merely a rendering  <BR>issue in the way each sample was antialiased
    and GIFfed.

  body: Thank you Raph, Richard, Stephen and all!  <BR>Now I know what is going on,
    yes Perpetua Titling is the best choice as it&#39;s a lot closer, even though
    I have Perpetua Std version on my Adobe Font CD but it is not like Perpetua Titling
    at all. <BR> <BR>Now the sample from Perpetua Titling, <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48333.png"
