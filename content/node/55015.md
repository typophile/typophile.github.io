  body: Haha, indeed. I totally get that everyone wants to feel exclusive and cool
    by using words like "kern" to make a statement, but it is important to get the
    terminology correct before stamping it all over your clothing (or maybe it isn't?
    :/).

  body: "Kerning and tracking are two related and frequently confused typographical
    terms. Both refer to the adjustment of space between characters of type. \r\n\r\nKerning
    is Selective Letter spacing.\r\n\r\nTracking is Overall Letterspacing.\r\n\r\n"
