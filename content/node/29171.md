  of Perpetua\r\n\r\nWritten by: Tiffany Wardle\r\nThe story of the Perpetua typeface
  (and Felicity Italic) is one of ideology, politics, commerce and creativity. The
  thread which runs through it all is the collaboration between two passionate and
  headstrong men, the eccentric letter carver Eric Gill and Monotype's typographic
  advisor Stanley Morison.\r\n\r\nFormat: PDF 1.3MB\r\n\r\nThe Experimental Type Designs
  of William Addison Dwiggins\r\n\r\nWritten by: Tiffany Wardle\r\nA thorough and
  interesting dissertation about the lesser-known type designs from the man who brought
  us Electra, Metro, Caledonia and the term \"graphic design\". Tiffany Wardle provides
  us with a brief biography of W. A. Dwiggins before launching into an inside look
  at his design process through numerous development samples and excerpts from the
  correspondence between the designer and Mergenthaler Linotype Company's venerable
  type director, C. H. Griffith.\r\n\r\nFormat: PDF 1.74MB\r\n\r\nThe Golden Age of
  Hand Lettering in American Advertising\r\n\r\nWritten by: Nick Shinn\r\nThis article
  provides readers with a look at the period in early magazine advertising when hand
  lettering was prevalent. Influential lettering artists/type designers are considered,
  in particular T. M. Cleland who was perhaps the greatest practitioner of his day.
  The author presents revealing analyses of examples of Cleland's work, the inherent
  production process, the influence of modernism on the profession and the trends
  and technologies that led to its eventual demise.\r\n\r\nFormat: PDF 4.59MB\r\n\r\n\r\nPunch
  Cuts: The Modern Page, 1843\r\n\r\nWritten by: Nick Shinn\r\nThrough the example
  of Punch magazine, this article sets a frame for looking at the origins and characteristics
  of Victorian typography in an art historical and socio-economical context. Nick
  Shinn examines the layout and typefaces that combined to create the typical periodical
  form of the era, as well as the conceptual environment for creating the sans serif
  types of the early 1800s that foreshadowed their \"modernist\" successors a century
  later.\r\n\r\nFormat: PDF 4.55MB\r\n\r\n"
