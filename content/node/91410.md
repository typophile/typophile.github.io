  programming rules into it. Who's got the unlauded English cursive?

  body: I mean really almost any "Brush" font or "script" font is in cursive.  There
    must be tens of thousands out there.  My vote, Lobster!  {runs and hides]

  body: "Okay, so you want favorite cursives. The probable is that there are many
    different types of script font. Brush is totally different from Shelley, and would
    be used in totally different situations. Then there are the pseudo handwriting
    fonts. Again, a different purpose.\r\n\r\nMost good typographers will have different
    favorites for each use."

  body: English Cursive is a specific genre of cursive script which is written using
    a pointed pen. Brush doesn't qualify ;)
