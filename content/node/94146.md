body: "Hey everybody,\r\n\r\nFonts are single-color. Differently colored outlines
  or filled-in sections (the hole in the capitol 'P', for example) could be created
  via the use of two fonts, one or both being useless without the other.\r\n\r\nAre
  there any common such font pairs out there that I should know about, or is this
  something that I would have to request from someone/build myself?"

    that comes to my mind: Rosewood, History, Geotica."

    font's name? I'm not sure how to look this up exactly."

  body: "Often it depends on the effect. Rosewood and the like, for example, often
    use the word \u201Cfill\u201D for the \u201Csecondary\u201D font. More complex
    effects call for more creative names.\r\nYou could look for \u201Cchromatic\u201D
    as a keyword, but, as I said, it depends on the style you\u2019re looking for."

  body: Some faces, like Peter Wiegel's Moebius have outlines and fills in the same
    file; one in upper and the other in lower case.

  body: "I saw this in a recent mailing from MyFonts.com. The font is Brownstone Sans.
    \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how the effect is achieved, but my guess is that you set
    your headline using filled-in characters, then create a duplicate text box on
    top of it, and then in the upper box you change some of the filled-in characters
    for alternates that aren't filled in. And you make the upper text box a different
    color.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font-example_3573.jpg]"
