body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI need some help with OT glyph names. Here is the situation:\r\n\r\nI
  have an f glyph, an i.alt01 glyph and an h.alt01 glyph. \r\n- I have named the ligature
  f + i.alt01 as fi.alt01, which at first seemed to make sense but now I\u2019m not
  so sure. Is this correct?\r\n- How should I name the f + h.alt01 ligature? Is it
  f_h.alt01, or would that denote the ligature f.alt01 + h.alt01?\r\n\r\nI have read
  over the adobe standards and some posts on the fontlab forum (by the very knowledgeable
  Adam Twardoch), but I can\u2019t figure it out.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: I'd use <code>f_i.alt01</code> and <code>f_h.alt01</code>, which I interpret
    as alternates of the ligatures <code>f_i</code> and <code>f_h</code>.
