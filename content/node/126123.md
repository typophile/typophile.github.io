  logotypes that include underlined like-ordinals characters (mostly a and o). I'm
  quite sure I've seen those on older buildings from the beginning of twentieth century.
  I am assuming that it has something to do with Art Deco and maybe what had come
  right next after it. But all I have found was one image of a rich family's tombstone
  in Prague (attached).\r\n\r\n(I'm sorry, but I can't come up with a better title.)
  \r\n\r\nThanks!"

    <em>Mothership</em> album.

  body: "Interesting topic \u2013 I came across the phenomenon a couple of days ago
    in Vienna, Austria on a building where it said \"ERBAUT ANN\xBA 1912\" (double
    underline under the ordinal). Meaning: \"built in [the year] 1912\", so your Art
    Nouveau suggestion would fit. The origins might have something to do with ordinal
    indicators \u2013 Wikipedia has quite an extensive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator\">article</a>
    on the a, o and other superscript forms and their function; my guess would be
    that in decorative lettering this original function was sometimes retained, sometimes
    wrongly adapted (as in my example, where Latin \"anno\" would not need any ordinal),
    and sometimes the form lost the original function and took over another (variation,
    visual balance, ornamentality)\u2026 I'll try to find more examples. "

  body: 'I don''t know where it originated but the trend seemed to be swinging from
    1880-1910. The Led Zeppelin logo and the calligraphy inside the Zeppelin IV album
    was based on the same interlock lettering fad. I think they used it to conjure
    up a mystical Aleister Crowley vibe. Also check the Souixsie and The Banshees
    logo cover for A Kiss in the Dreamhouse. Have a look at archives of piano sheet
    music cover art from before and after 1900 and you''ll see the evolution of the
    trend. Piano sheet music cover art seemed like it was a competition to see who
    come come up with the most outlandish tucks and interlocks. I think the beginning
    of this trend was the Arts & Crafts movement in situations where a using circular
    O was thematically appropriate but would have made a title too wide. Instead of
    squeezing the O narrow and spoiling the theme, the designer would shrink it and
    add some decorative filler underneath: a bar, diamonds, squares, a teardrop. Articles
    like THE or AND could be vertically stacked. The horizontals of L,T,Z were used
    for playful interlocks. The bottom stroke the the K might knock off the stem of
    a following letter. It was combat! I guess there must have been situations were
    a designer wanted to pop the O but there was no O in the word so they''d pop another
    letter like the D in your example. But I don''t think it was common. Charles Rennie
    Mackintosh was a famous designer who used the raised O quite a bit. As well as
    double or triple crossbars on A, H. It may not have been his invention but it''s
    wouldn''t surprised me if he didn''t help popularize it as he was so influential
    in Art Nouveau and Arts & Crafts.  The trend seemed to die off with Art Deco and
    didn''t return until those Zeppelin Album covers.'
