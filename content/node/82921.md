    but I didn't realize that fonts were so expensive.  This is disheartening.

  body: "Welcome to the world of quality digital typography. It's generally true that
    you get what you pay for, and remember you are helping support many of the people
    who you might see on this forum -- many of them are type designers.\r\n\r\nIf
    you have ever tried designing a font, and doing it properly, with adjusted kerning
    pairs and alternate glyphs and ligatures, you would understand why licenses are
    expensive. That's also (unfortunately) partly to offset the losses due to piracy.
    We encourage licensing from the designers, and choosing carefully, the way you
    would weigh any other purchasing decision. When you have built your own font library
    you'll find it something to take pride in like a collection of fine books. \r\n\r\nAt
    least that's how I look at my collection.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    the right font</em> in their work should expect to pay for that benefit. Otherwise
    eventually people won't be able to find that \"perfect\" font.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
