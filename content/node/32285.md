  body: "Hi Eduardo\r\nIt's looking good. A few quick comments:\r\nr seems a bit too
    narrow\r\nj and y seems to acend too deep\r\nThe cut-off piece on the e is a bit
    distracting, but you only notice it in the very large sizes.\r\nk upper arm is
    a little weak\r\n\r\nIn the bold cut I feel that the upper case glyphs are too
    dark compared to the lower case, and compared to the relationship between upper-
    and lower case in the regular cut."

  body: "Am I right and you want to use the red g and w as alternates!?!\r\n\r\nIf
    so I would make the red w the primary letter and the other one the alternate.
    The red one is more humanistic and better fits to the binocular g.\r\n\r\nI dont
    like the shoulder on the letters n, m (and u). I would make them a little bit
    rounder. The shoulder on the a is really nice.\r\n\r\nI think it would look nice
    if you slant the crossbar on the e a little bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings: Steven"
