<p>I&rsquo;m 14 and I&rsquo;ve been interested in type since I was 10. I&rsquo;ve designed a typeface called expletus sans. Since I&rsquo;m only 14 I don&rsquo;t have any educational background about typedesign.  This typeface is meant as a project to learn from so any comments, good or bad, are welcome. To judge it properly I suggest you download and print the pdf, so you won&rsquo;t make any misjudgements because of rendering issues. On flickr I&rsquo;ve already had a lot help from Alexei Vanyshin, so special thanks to you Alexei!</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance,</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First off Kudos to you. That is great work!
I think the look you&rsquo;re going for really shines in the lowercase &rsquo;t' and uppercase &lsquo;F&rsquo;.
It really creates a look of dimension in the negative space.
In places such as the lowercase q and p. the curve at the end seems a bit forced.
Obviously there will be difficulties in that area because your dealing with a curve that needs to flow into another. That styling cue works well with all straight lines but all curved lines seem to have the same fault.</p>
<p>Again, great work, i&rsquo;m so impressed.</p>

<p>Nice to see you here on typophile,
It is great to see your skills excell.</p>
<p>The bold version is more consistent in proportions, I would suggest
you to compare these weights. One way of doing this is to
paste the bold outlines as a mask to the regular font.
You will see, that /j/ needs to be shortened in the descender, 
loop of /g/ gets too narrow in regular, bold is ok.
I would also extend the /z/ (top to the right and bottom to the left.)</p>

<p>When I saw florentina is was almost gonna mail you that somebody had stolen your typeface. why did you change the name?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have a look at the j, g. I&rsquo;m gonna be stubborn about the z and keep it this way. I did actually use the bold as a mask for the regular, but If I did it according to the mask the regular became to condensed. Because it doens&rsquo;t line up with the mask neatly I might have missed a few things. thanks again.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is really nice. I only have a few comments (take these all with a grain of salt &ndash; they&rsquo;re purely my opinion):</p>
<p>• The curve at the bottom of the bowl of the &ldquo;d&rdquo; is a lot sharper than other letters. Maybe see what it looks like if it&rsquo;s more like the &ldquo;b&rdquo;</p>
<p>• the hook on the bottom of the &ldquo;j&rdquo; might be a little long (i.e. too far to the left). This seems more of an issue on the lightest weight.</p>
<p>• the way the righthand stroke on the &ldquo;y&rdquo; gets thinner at the top seems out of place</p>
<p>• the right half of the &ldquo;m&rdquo; seems narrower than the left. This could just be an optical illusion, but even so, you might need to widen that half to make it look more balanced.</p>
<p>You might be better off really perfecting one weight before moving on to the others. It&rsquo;s very tempting to do (I&rsquo;ve done it myself), but it can create a lot of extra work, and all the changes can be hard to keep track of.</p>
<p>nice job!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks jonathan</p>
<p>The curve in the d is indeed sharper than other letters, but I don&rsquo;t cinsider it TO sharp. It can certainly not be like the d because that way the gap between the bottom of the bowl and the stem would become to small. Thanks for telling me this though. Maybe I should have another look at it.</p>
<p>I already changed the j, but it seems a bit useless to upload a new picture for one thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably right about the y, so I&rsquo;ll have to find another way of getting the right colour. There has to be a contrast within that stroke. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>The right half of the m is indeed smaller. I thought the differnece was to small to make a difference, but while working on Expletus Serif I realized it does make a difference. In the w the left part is clearly narrower, but the gap creates whitespace, although I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s enough. I think I&rsquo;ll move the left and right part in the w apart and make the stroke that &lsquo;creates&rsquo; the gap longer.</p>
<p>Thanks for your clear and positive help.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Looking very good! The font is very interesting in larger sizes, but the breaks seem to basically dissolve at text sizes. I think your upper- and lowercase S need some work - letters like a, p, q, and so on are very smooth, in a way reminiscent of Myriad, but the S&rsquo;s seem to have slightly harsher curves, with proportions a little closer to FF Meta. The line also doesn&rsquo;t appear quite consistent (the spine needs to be a bit thicker&hellip;.). I still think the r doesn&rsquo;t quite match with the font. It just sticks out. Maybe if you made it join the stem lower still, that would help. This would also help it to appear a little more even in text.</p>
<p>The breaks in you letters are also a bit inconsistent in that, while some of the letters break in some places, and other letters break in other places, most seem to only have one break. The m sticks out a bit because of the two breaks - what would it look like if the middle join smoothly? The lowercase w has a break, but the uppercase W doesn&rsquo;t?

		<div class="commentbody">Well, to be intirely honest, expletus was not intended for something untill half a year ago. When I started the first designs (which are absolutely horrible), I thought that the concept of the gap itself would be enough to make it a bestseller. I was 10 years old. As I grew older and more experienced I learned that there was still A LOT to learn for me and perfection doesn&rsquo;t exist. It wasn&rsquo;t untill half a year ago that I took my time to think about what it&rsquo;s actually supposed to be used for. I decided it was mainly for print, but, like most display typefaces, could also be used at large (24+) sizes in websites or other screen usage. It also wasn&rsquo;t untill then, that I decided to view expletus as a project to learn from, instead of a rush for gold. It seemed important to me, to understand what happens to a design when you print it at a smaller size. To make expletus an even bigger challenge, I decided to make it reasonably legible at smaller sizes (9+) though not a real text face. &ldquo;I assumed your font must be at least intended for text somewhat, because of the large blocks of text in your PDF&gt;&rdquo; Yes, you could say that it was somewhat, not intirely, intended for text.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jasper, great work!
I notice from your PDF that the width of some glyphs are off. For example, compared to o, a, h, k, K, m, n, u and w are too wide. s leans to the left. Why not make x more like k? And I think y could be more in style with the other glyphs. Furthermore, the upper bowl on S isn&rsquo;t really flowing, G feels a little narrow and T, V, W and Z could be more in style. You&rsquo;ve designed 1 with an apex, I&rsquo;d consider keep the top flat, like you&rsquo;ve done with 4. 7 seems a little off too, perhaps keep the leg straight, or at least less curvy?</div>

The gaps are just there to create a sense of openness. The gaps cause a lot of trouble in curves, so if I try to implement them into a curve that was made without the gap, I&rsquo;ll probably end up with the same thing as I have now. The gaps also change the whitespace in some characters, so I really do think it&rsquo;s best to include them from the start in the design process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You’re here to learn right?&rdquo; True. I still reconsider some (possible) gaps, such as in the W, k, K, r and y.</p>

<p>I think what Frode means is, for you to make a stencil (or semi-stencil) typeface properly, you should understand the nature of type for stencils anyway, how they work, and where the most optimal places for breaks are to make them sturdy enough. It&rsquo;s easy enough to think that the breaks are in the best places, but a much better informed typeface can be created which will end up looking better, because it&rsquo;s creator knows what works.</p>
<p>As you say, it&rsquo;s not about the function of a stencil typeface, but how it looks. What does a stencil typeface look like but a stencil?</p>

The notches are placed at places where two strokes cross and one of the strokes continues in both directions past the gap. In the n the stem continues in two directions past the place of the notch. In the v, it would only continue in one direction, so there is no gap there.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;e&rsquo; has only one possible place for a notch, the x has two. To create more unity I limited it to one notch per glyph. I had to make an exception to this in the m.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I will qualify my observations by saying that I am not very experienced with designing typefaces as the lovely folks who already gave suggestions.  I hope it is helpful anyway!</p>
<p>There seems to be a couple different concepts in terms of how the breaks read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shadow/depth like A, X, w, x.  I really like the dimensional quality of the cut.</li>
<li>Hand written stroke feel like B, D, P, a, b, d.  Maybe like overgrown ink traps.  The stroke is sort of trailing off to a taper.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the difference has a lot to do with how the curved/tapered end of the cut off stroke relates to the straight piece it is approaching.  I personally love the ones that give a 3D effect, and miss it in the rest.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think I share your opinion on this. Expletus started from a single x, in which the curved end follows the straight piece it&rsquo;s aproaching. The still is to me, the best representative of expletus' style, but I don&rsquo;t think the other glyphs have a different style. A good designer might argue, that every gkyph should have exactly the same style, but I think this is simply not possible, due to legebility issues and construction. Although I still believe in the concept of expletus, your comment is not useless. I have already approached the notches in a more individual way than when I started expletus, but I should probably do this even more. When I&rsquo;m back home, I&rsquo;ll have a closer look at how the curved ends relate to the stroke they&rsquo;re approaching. Thanks for your help.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here&rsquo;s an update with improved stem widths in both Caps and lowercase and overall thicker caps. Also the overshoot in the caps is increased and the shape of FEGPR is improved. I hope this is another step towards a good typeface. Do you think it&rsquo;s time to start on the bold?</div>
