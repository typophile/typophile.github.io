body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nLooking for some good suggestions on what font to use next
  to Roma (link)\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/roma/regular/\r\n\r\nI'm
  kinda looking for a sans serif preferably a thin or light version comparable to
  the Roma inline variant\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/roma/inline/\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to put some headers in a thin at around 24pt, i was thinking about using DTL
  Noble but the light isn't quite thin enough + its a bit over my budget :-D\r\n\r\nHope
  someone can help, thanks!"

  body: "Alright Evie, since you are desperate I will have a stab at trying to help
    you.\r\n\r\nSo you are looking for a thin, san-serif font to use as body text
    go with your titles that are in Roma? Just to get this straight.\r\n\r\nWhat is
    your budget? It helpful to have an exact figure to plan to, however for now I'll
    ignore it for the most part.\r\n\r\nI have to admit it's a little tricky sifting
    through all these font families for the perfect weight whilst keeping the \"Roman
    theme\":\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tipo-pepel/trajana-sans/|Trajana
    Sans]] - If you don't mind only having capital letters, this could be an option
    because it has a light variant. The san-serif counterpart to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/trajan/|Trajan]],
    a beautiful Roman serif typeface.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura/fonts/|Futura]]
    - A legendary geometric font family based upon old-lettering, despite its futuristic-sounding
    name it has a wonderful old-fashioned ambiance to it. There is a light variant,
    but I couldn't find a thin variant so easily. Almost everyone loves Futura, it's
    well crafted and easy-to-read though I don't think it really belongs on most of
    McCarren's airport signage.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itf-alanmeeks/colosseum/|Colosseum]]
    - Looks pretty good, definitely got a more old-fashioned jibe to it than the modern
    san-serif typefaces of this world. Also inspired by Trajan, but with lower case
    lettering making it a good compromise.\r\n\r\nHere are my suggestions! Tell me
    how I can improve on them.\r\n\r\n-Inferno986return-\r\n\r\n"
