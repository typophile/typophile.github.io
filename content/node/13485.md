  at Linotype.com</a>\r\n\r\nKarlgeorg Hoefer was one of the foremost German calligraphers
  of the 20th Century. He taught at the [[HfG Offenbach]] from 1947 through 1979.
  During the 1980s, he founded the [[Schreibwerkstatt Offenbach]] (Calligraphy Workshop
  Offenbach), which organized calligraphy lessons, workshops, and exhibitions for
  the general public. This is very closely alligned with the [[Klingspor Museum]].\r\n\r\nHoefer
  designed many typefaces throughout his career. His first typeface was [[Salto]],
  which was published by the [[Klingspor]] foundry during the early 1950s. He would
  later design typefaces for [[Ludwig and Mayer]], [[D. Stempel AG]], and [[Linotype
  Library]]. [[FE Engschrift]], the font from which German license plates are made,
  is based off of one of Hoefer's lettering experiments from the 1970s.\r\n\r\nOne
  of Hoefer's sons, [[Otmar Hoefer]], followed his father into the printing industry,
  and today is the Product Marketing Director at [[Linotype Library]]."
