  exact font, but I can't seem to figure out what it is. I have seen similar fonts
  in the same style, but if anyone knows exactly what this is please let me know.
  I know it's kind of hard to see in the pictures but any guesses would be appreciated.
  Or even if you have similar fonts to recommend! Thanks so much.\r\n- Jess\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_lqlt2bv0HV1r0gda1o1_500_5617.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/41728734017050628_E60SSjSK_c_4680.jpg]"

  body: No I understand. I wish I had a better picture but this is all I could find.
    I'm just trying to find the most similar fonts anyone could recommend. I don't
    know very much about fonts so that's why I came on here to ask. Thanks!

  body: "I think instead of trying to match an exact font you need to do some other
    things: make sure your tattoo artist can handle text - it's a pretty difficult
    thing to get right; and find a font that simply has the overall proportions and
    feeling that you'd like. Tattooing is not a high-fidelity medium, so it's not
    like you can actually reproduce fine details in a font. So it's better to start
    with something relatively plain so you don't end up with a bad surprise. Considering
    you like the tattoo above, maybe something like this:\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/videtur/regular\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
