  of this forum - and it might even be viewed as bad news rather than good news -
  I think it's likely to be something some visitors here will be looking for.\r\n\r\nFirst,
  at\r\n\r\n[[http://pakdata.com/products/arabic-font-holy-quran]]\r\n\r\na free Arabic
  font is available that provides the features necessary to typeset the Quran.\r\n\r\nSecond,
  the Pak Nastaleeq font, still available online, although the official government
  site of the project is down, or may simply have been renamed, while somewhat simplified,
  still offers about 200 ligatures, and, thus, it should at least be adequate for
  many purposes.\r\n\r\n(EDIT: I misremembered what I had read. There are 200 glyphs
  in the font, but <em>no</em> ligatures.)\r\n\r\nOne site from which it may be downloaded
  is:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.urdujahan.com/font.html]]"
