body: "My deck is about to split and I've decided I'm going to be painting my replacement.
  I've been playing around with some ideas for the last half hour. I think I'm going
  to go with a tribute to one of my favorite albums - Iggy Pop's \"Raw Power\". \r\n\r\nI
  was wondering if I could get some feedback / suggestions for a typeface for the
  words \"raw power\".\r\n\r\nIt's funny how you can think something looks great,
  make some revisions, look at what you started with, think it looks like crap. I
  did this tonight starting with Bauhaus. "
