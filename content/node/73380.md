body: "Hi everyone, i\xB4d appreciate your critique and thoughts about this logo.
  \r\nLet me explain a little bit, this is for a local jewelry store, i need to create
  a sophisticated mark with a little arabic character to take advantage of the name
  roots. \r\nAlso \xBFDo you think this fonts have a slightly arabic flavor? I will
  need to add a tagline, which sans serif can you recommend? Any comments well appreciated.\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: "I would go with the upper version (I quite like that smoky 'F', it has good
    proportions), and see if I could make that 'I' not to lean backwards. \r\n\r\nAnd
    I would promptly change that acute accent to apostrophe."

  body: "Thanks tomi, i belive the I leaning backwads looks even more backwards if
    i try to fix it. Is fertigo maybe i\xB4ll stick with fontin. My keyboard is in
    spanish, i cant find the keys combo for the apostrophe."

  body: The upper version has more character. But I think it is a good loge because
    of its retention value

    version now with the tagline added. I still use fertigo in this one because i
    belive it retains more character as Robert stated. Any comments well aprecciated
    and thank you very much for your support.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/faiat2_3769.gif]"

  body: It would be nice if the tagline had some contrast with the wordmark. A beautiful
    serif? Small caps? Something to differentiate and compliment.

  body: "@Apankart, thanks for noting the similarities, i\xB4ll be checking if that
    would be an issue.\r\nScott, thanks for the serif suggestion, i\xB4ll try it,
    i honestly have not given any chance to a serifs in this logo.\r\n\r\nDo anybody
    have some comment about the \"arab flavor\"?\r\n"

  body: "I speak Arabic, and I didn't see any \"Arabic flavors\" from this. I quite
    like the design, but maybe channel more of the Arabic letters into your smoky
    F if you want to show more Arabic quality.\r\n\r\nNow, depending on how you're
    pronouncing \"Faiad\", it could mean a few different things. I think it may be
    \u0641\u0627\u0626\u0636 or excess, overabundance. Look closely at the Arabic
    letter and the concept of \"Faiad\" and channel that. Arabic letters connect and
    curve. They are frequented with diamond dots and rising and falling letters. You're
    on the right path!"

    which is usually related to jewels. A geometric uppercase sans-serif, maybe? '
