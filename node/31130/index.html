This uses the silkscreen typeface available at <a href:"http://kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/index.html">Kottke.org</a>, a widely used typeface for this use. I had to recreate the logo for 15 pixels because the favicon is 16 pixels and looks like poop when squooshed.

Anyone else have a badge variation? Also, feel free to use this one if you want to represent.

The T is always intended to vary in the materials we've produced. It just happens that the block T works really well for the browser icon and has now taken over the page header. So, it's natural that the badge use the same T at this size.<br><BR>

I think I prefer the solid red or solid gray rectangle (with subtle border) that Eben posted. It does look like the PH could use another pixel.<br><BR>

		<div class="commentbody">Those updated ones look great! I still like the red box on grey version, but they all look stellar. Thanks!

I gotta ask, how do you get that sleek almost 3d feeling with stuff so small? In fact, since you said you worked with pixels before, is there some kind of rules or guidelines for working with stuff so small?

Since Thunderbird doesn't have an official badge, but Firefox does, I tried to make to match it. It's hard! Trying to get the logo to condense was the worst. At first I just shrank it down, but it looked like crap. Then I progressively shrank it in increments of 50% with bicubic sharper. That helped a lot. But how to get the <em>feel</em> of the original, or of yours, is beyond me.

Any suggestions?

I don't know. Do you mean the text or the shading? One way to suss out what happeing in a micro pixel thing you like is to zoom in close & check out what happening on a pixel by pixel basis. The gradient on some is just a gradient but made quite faint or subtle. The edge is just a sigle pixel line on the top & left 100% white dialed back to 45% or so and the bottom is 100% black dialed back to 20% or so. #6 has a trick hard pixel shadow. It's on a dark red so it doesn't read as what it is which is just hard black pixels. The last 3 are just 2 color... Having a pixel friendly logo helps as well of course. And you gave me a head start with those letters. I think if I was doing it for cash I might have done some subvisible pixel shading for the Y.

There used to be really intense pixel centered tools available in the game industry. They were insanely cool. Photoshop is great but it's not pixel centered. Sometimes when I see the best pixel art I think " I bet they have an old mac running studio 8 or studio 32...".

BTW You are right to work in steps of 50% exactly to maintain as much sharpness as possble. It will still suck - but less... 

Sometimes you just have to start editing over the mush you make. Having a way to see what you are doing up close & at 100% very fast or at once is a huge help as well.  Having vector art to scale can help too. The macromdia fireworks was allways more pixel aware than the Adobe tools were. Not sure why.

What don't you like about your thundrbird badge anyway?

It does seem like you don't want to have both logos is such as small space perhaps. It makes it too hard I think. Or maybe have the logos side by side on the left & then let the words be unbroken on the right? Or is that two badges? 

If so, the issue might just be that thunderbird's logo doesn't shrink well which is hardly your fault. Perhaps just keep the head, and then you can let the text be on one line? Then the head is bigger.

Actually I just went to your blog & I think your thunderbird bage looks quite good there! I am tempted to takle it all back!</div>

As to my avatar, I painted it a few years ago. It's cropped down, but originally it was a flower. I normally paint non-objective art using the same watercolor technique. My old roomate asked me, "Why can't you just paint something that people like. Like a flower or something?" And thus it was born.
