    at Myfonts.com\r\n\r\nAleksey Kryukov's Old Standard is a good, free font to refer

    the Wiki pages on the cyrillic alphabet.\r\n\r\nGet the book \"Language Type Culture\",
    read the Zhukov and Yefimov essays in it, and enjoy the specimens of new types!\r\n\r\nSee

  body: Kryukov's Old Standard is not only a good reference, but it also brings back
    some beatuiful glyph shape subtleties and variants that were lost in decades of
    western digitalisation of cyrillic type. IMHO at least.

  body: "Yes. I LOVE its yat, for example, (a letter abolished in Russian in the 20ies),
    as compared to the ones to be found in most modern digital type. Most others look
    so awkward and defying a sense of proportion for the cyrillic (then again, whom
    to blame for a non-existing (as in current usage) glyph?). Which designer, but
    one aiming at old or classical (church slavonic) text would care?\r\n\r\nOh, and
    this yat looks exactly as the yat in the pocket dictionary my great-grandfather
    brought back from Russia after being released POWWI. No wonder, as Aleksey also
    states the source/inspiration/... of his type \"late 19th early 20th century\"."
