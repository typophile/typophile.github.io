  body: Chris, I really like how the design renders on the image you posted. But when
    I open the PDF and see the glyphs in large size, some of them don't live up to
    the expectations. I'm not quite sure how to explain it. Might be the sharp stroke
    endings.

  body: "Hello Chris:\r\n\r\nI have just a few comments:\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the
    light weight of NOW is very handsome and set's well in small sizes. Of the weights
    shown here, it is by far my favorite.\r\n\r\nThe things I notice most and question
    are here:\r\n\r\nI am not a fan of the ligatures where you have extended the terminal
    of the \"f\". In comparison to the regular glyph, it is definitely the obvious
    solution, but it does feel a little bit alien to the font.\r\n\r\nThe branch (is
    this the right term) on the lower-case \"r\" is also troubling. It seems a little
    light, and I notice it when I compare it to other stroke weights. Realizing that
    it needs to be optically adjusted, or that this is an artistic decision, I suppose
    it doesn't need tweaking. After all, in comparison with other horizontal strokes,
    such as the cross stroke on the \"f\", it seems as though it has been properly
    proportioned.\r\n\r\nThe Pilcrow has a small notch missing from it, interesting
    design. The radical is also a bit interesting, as it is missing the horizontal
    stroke that follows from the top of the diagonal. This isn't a mistake in the
    least; I have just tended to feel that a radical without the added stroke isn't
    as recognizable. I think it has to do with the connection I made with drawing
    so many radicals in school under which I had to align a series of complicated
    numbers and variables.\r\n\r\n-Matt"

    on the f swelling slightly toward the very end. This is mitigated by the screen
    at small sizes. This might be mitigated in the drawing by making the outlines
    toward the end slightly more parallel or slightly narrowing, or slightly shorter,
    or a combination of these. This a matter of only a few units. \r\n\r\nThe hooking
    strokes on your a and t light do not swell toward the end at all, and I don't
    think have the issue that Miguel point to in the f. Some of your other strokes,
    like in the s do, so you might want to check those and see if you like them that
    way or like the a and t. \r\n\r\nFrutiger handled his terminals in the 'Frutiger'

    I was thinking about this on the way home a while ago, and I think that shortening
    the \"l\" would allow you to give the overhang of the \"f\" a curve that would
    suit it better. Simply stated, I am not a fan of how in the ligatures that have

    the flaring of the terminals, but rather due to the high shoulder of the 'f',
    which forces you to do a tighter curve. Perhaps the overhang stroke should start
    branching from the stem sooner, which would make the curve more full. (Not quite
    sure if I'm making sense...)\r\n\r\nI'm of the visual kind, so here's an illustration:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ffatt_5979.png]\r\nDo
    you see how the curve on the 't' looks more balanced? It's not as noticeable on
    the flipped 'f'. Also, the stroke on the 'a' seems \"broken\" and a little stiff.\r\n\r\n(Please
    ignore my comments whenever you feel like. I might be rambling... seriously ;^)\r\n\r\n[Edit]

    Here are some guesses: Are the ace too wide compared to the bd? You have no entry

    on the ij and round ones on the mnrx. You have no exit serifs on the mnh, but

    feels quite narrow, in comparison with the rest. Here's my suggestion: maintain
    the length of the crossbar, and extend the overhang by 1/3 of the crossbar. Do
    this simply by moving the 2 corner points of the terminal over to the right. Important:
    resist the temptation of moving these points down; only right (and up) is allowed
    (!!).\r\nAlso, you might need to rotate those 2 points counter-clockwise a bit,
    so that the exit angle of the overhang is a tad more horizontal. Ok, now the tricky
    part: reshape the 'f' curve (sorry, no intention to be rude ;), in order to get
    a full-round-&-smooth curve, from the stem all the way to those 2 corner points
    (that you did NOT move ;). You might need to fiddle around with the nodes I marked

    in itself, but the relation of the f terminal to the rest of the face, and how
    it makes words together with the others. The 'best' is what works best with the
    rest of the face. \r\n\r\nEg, comparison with the hooked terminals on the a and
    t and s terminals is relevant, as well as the crossbar of the f and t. Does the
    reduced weight of the f terminal conflict with the weight of the crossbar? (On
    Frutiger regular the hook terminates just slightly lighter than the cross bar.)
    If you perceive a conflict, you can either reduce the weight of the cross bar
    or increase the weight of the terminal. If you reduce the weight of the cross
    bar, then you have to consider how it relates to the cross bar of the e and the
    strokes on the a and s. As to the roundness of the curve that is definitely a
    matter of the curves in the rest of the face. Even here you already successfuly
    have the pd different from the mn, so some variation can work, but not others.

    other weights).</em>\r\n\r\nI don't think that this is necessary true. Lighter
    weights need lots of different curve treatment than regular weights. Think of
    it as a continuum from one \"style\" of curve to another. As you add weight the
    curve changes along an axis."

    a self-sufficient individual rather than a team member. I like the tension in
    my latest flatter one and feel that it more closely echos the feeling in the n
    and m as well as the a.</em>\r\n\r\nYes, I agree that my alternative is tamed,
    compared to yours. And yes, I probably abstracted it too much from the remaining
    alphabet. In addition, I don't know how the design is pictured in your mind.\r\n\r\nNonetheless,
    one thing you cannot forget is that the curve on the 'f' can't be a mirrored version
    of the curve on the 'n' (not saying that's your case, tho). In the 't', maybe,
    but definitely not the 'f'. As you know, stress-angled curves can be rotated,
    but not flipped.\r\nFor the 'f', you probably need to look more at your design
    of the letters 'c' 'd' 'g' etc.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is a sans-serif, some of
    the principles that rule the serif faces need to be observed. Otherwise, in the
    extreme cases, things like this may happen:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/18824\r\n\r\nYou're
    far, far from that ;^)"

    overall character of the family. None of the curves from the other weights try
    to match eachother exactly.\r\n\r\nThe f is not a mirrored n, I just meant the
    curve flattens as it joins.  You are right, c d g are better examples.\r\n\r\nI
    remember that thread Miguel! Glad I am not quite that bad :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I like it :) A few comments:\r\n\r\nI don't think that \"feature\" on the
    'i' and 'j' is beneficial to your typeface. This is quite noticeable on the Display
    weight. Also, the tail on the 'q' seems a bit forced; perhaps it just needs what
    you do in the 'u' (or rotate the 'i', stick it there, and see how it looks).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quick_i_6517.png]\r\n\r\nIs
    the 'r' a tad wide? Maybe trimming a bit of the arm will do the trick; and at
    the same time you'd get a stroke that doesn't bend down as much.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/serif_r_4110.png]\r\n\r\nI
    find the crossbar of the 'e' a bit stiff. Look at your 'b' and 'p', they're much
    graceful.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/e_italic_3949.png]"
