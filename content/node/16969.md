  the ascenders are partially chopped off and they print like that. I am using QuarkXPress

  body: In what format is the font? Are you using Adobe Type Manager? I know I'm probably
    not the first to advise this, but I highly recommend moving up to InDesign and
    OS X where such wacky rendering problems aren't nearly as common.

    probably fix the problem.\r\n\r\nIf they are Type 1 fonts, make sure ATM is set
    to \"preserve character shapes\" rather than \"preserve line spacing.\"\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
