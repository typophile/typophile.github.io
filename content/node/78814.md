body: "Hello,\r\nI may be the last one to have seen this piece on Vimeo, but I did
  a quick search here and found no mention of it. I think this is a stunning example
  of how animated typography can make poetry \"speak\" far more eloquently than it
  does by itself, either as a \"typeset\" missive or purely as spoken word performance.
  You can see the Video here: http://vimeo.com/3829682 and my commentary at Alphabet
