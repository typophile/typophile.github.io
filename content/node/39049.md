  B-17 bombers? I know that most of them were hand drawn without any style, but I
  am designing an article on pin ups and motors and the look of Nose Art would be
  just perfect.\r\n\r\nHere is just an example\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pixentral.com/show.php?picture=1K0TTxNArruhMilPgeebQktCec4Ow2\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pixentral.com/show.php?picture=1F17czYv9ZcxHAaltVV9U0EH9j9CzV0\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas? Thanks\r\nSebastiao"

    particularly stuff from Font Diner, House Industries, or FlashFonts. But the work
    is the important part\u2014to really make it work you\u2019ll need to play with
    scaling, outlines, and shadows, otherwise you\u2019ll just be tacking on some
    display type."
