body: "I am looking for a more featured version of Trump Mediaeval, and the ones I
  see on myFonts that look like they might be right are the Linotype and Paratype
  sets.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nTrump Mediaeval Std (Linotype): The opentype one looks
  like it has smallcaps and old-style numbers, but doesn't have any more ligatures
  than my old one (only fi and fl). Is this just the old Linotype outlines put into
  an opentype file, along with the smallcaps that was a separate file before opentype?\r\n\r\nTrump
  Mediaeval Pro Cyrillic (Linotype): Has the smallcaps and more ligatures (the ffi
  one in particular), but the glyph dump seemed to indicate that there are no smallcaps
  or old-style figures in the file.\r\n\r\nKuenstler 480 (Paratype / Bitstream): The
  opentype one offered by Paratype seems to have the old-style numbers, small-caps
  and ligatures (including fj, which isn't in the Pro Cyrillic Linotype one).\r\n\r\nThe
  Paratype one seems like the best buy, but am I missing something about it, or the
  others? Does the preview not show some glyphs or are they missing from both Linotype
  versions?\r\n\r\nAlso, it is described as a Kuenstler. What does this mean? I have
  seen this tag on Weiss and Schneidler too."

    developed a system to name typefaces systematically, based on their historic or
    visual traits, plus a numbering system for specific identification. They did this
    because the names of the typefaces that they were developing their own versions
    of were trademarked by other companies.\r\n\r\nKuenstler (<em>K\xFCnstler</em>)
    is the German word for artist. <em>K\xFCnstlerschriften</em> (or artist typefaces)
    is a German term for typefaces designed by artists \u2013 including commercial
    artists \u2013 rather than having been developed by in-house a foundry\u2019s
    technical staff.  Schneidler, Trump and Weiss were all <em>Schriftk\xFCnstler,</em>
    or what we might now call independent type designers, who sold or licensed designs-on-paper
    to type foundries.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Is this just the old Linotype outlines put

    I was very in to gothic music. Album cover art was something that really drew
    me in. I bought the Earth Inferno album (vinyl!) by Fields of the Nephilim and
    on it was a typeface I had not seen before. I studied it and with the help of
    some letterpresses (pre-internet era) I came to the conclusion it was Trump International.
    I really loved that font.\r\nNow I'm reading this thread it reminded me of it,
    but I can't seem to find any reference anywhere at all to Trump International.
    Did I dream it? Was I just a young foolish dressed-in-black boy?"

    it seems to hold up reasonably with ligatures off. Paratype's update of Kuenstler
    480 looks to be the best though, so when I desperately need smallcaps and extra
    ligatures I think that's the one to buy."

    f-ligatures are not quite the same as the original designs, but seem to be quite

    is exactly right. When Adobe converted its library to OpenType about ten years
    ago, it combined the regular fonts with Expert Sets (from Adobe and Monotype)
    and Small Caps and Oldstyle Figure Sets (from Linotype). A few symbols were added
    to every converted font, but they did not add new ligatures."

    client who still makes significant use of Trump. I've drawn up the double-f ligatures
    to match the Stempel foundry fonts, and reweighted the italic just a touch --
    it was always a bit light with the roman. Anyway, if I could get more characters
    from ParaType -- or anywhere -- that would be useful for this client."
