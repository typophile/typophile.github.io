  as a ripoff of Dolly. Have anyone here used it, or have any opinions? My first impression
  was that this was a very affordable text typeface. I saw the Dutch/Underware-ish
  touch in it, but never mistook it for Dolly. It looks lovely, though I''m concerned
  with the bad spacing in the online type tester. '

  body: "Actually thanks for bring this topic up.\r\n\r\nI know what you meant Frode,
    and I\u2019m not picking on you, :-)  but by even mentioning the price you made
    <em>the</em> key point about how type designers who make obviously derivative
    fonts get the attention of graphic designers and make customers out of them\u2014lower
    prices.\r\n\r\nA scenario:\r\nFrode, I\u2019m sure that you are very familiar
    with Dolly, perhaps this is one of your favorites. \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s say you
    don\u2019t own it. A client or a project necessitates \u201Cfriendly low contrast\u201D
    type\u2014 tho not any one particular design or foundry. Your smart. The gears
    start rolling in your head, you have 10 different tabs open in your browser with
    different designs, you\u2019ve even printed out some PDF\u2019s. You winnow the
    chaff from the wheat. (I happen to consider myself the expert in and comparison-shopping)\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ve
    got Dederon on your screen and now your thinking. It\u2019s expensive, but thorough.
    A little wide, but that does emphasize reading direction. It has a sans counter
    part, but you happen to hate the wobbly looking lowercase g. The repertoire is
    extensive\u2014yes, but you can develop a hierarchy with other fonts and the sans
    looks like Lisboa which you might already have or get .\r\n\r\nDolly is nice.
    You like almost everything about it except lc g because the ear is too small,
    you can also forget about opentype automation or numeral options. AND WHERE ARE
    ALL MY SEXY BUT UNNECESSARY LIGATURES AT? The kerning in Dolly is leagues better
    so much that it makes Dederon seem downright unprofessional (type a couple of
    choice [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/suitcase/dederon_serif_family/?&sample_text=%E2%80%9CAsk%20Jeff%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%98Ask%20Jeff%E2%80%99.%20The%20chef%20d%E2%80%99%C5%93uvre!%20Two%20%5Bof%5D%20(of)%20%E2%80%98of%E2%80%99%20%E2%80%9Cof%E2%80%9D%20of%3F%20of!%20of*.%20%20Ydes%2C%20Yffignac%20and%20Ygrande%20are%20in%20France%3A%20so%20are%20Ypres%2C%20Les%20Wo%C3%ABvres%2C%20F%C3%B4ret%20de%20W%C5%93vres%2C%20the%20Voire%20and%20Vauvise.%20Yves%20is%20in%20heaven%3B%20D%E2%80%99Amboise%20is%20in%20jail.%20Lyford's%20in%20Texas%20%26%20L%E2%80%99Anse-aux-Griffons%20in%20Qu%C3%A9bec%3B%20the%20%C5%81yna%20in%20Poland.%20Yriate%2C%20Yciar%20and%20Ysa%C3%BFe%20are%20at%20Yale.%20Kyoto%20and%20Ryotsu%20are%20both%20in%20Japan%2C%20Kwikpak%20on%20the%20Yukon%20delta%2C%20Kv%C3%A6ven%20in%20Norway.%20%20Kyulu%20in%20Kenya.%20not%20in%20Rwanda.%E2%80%A6
    | words]] in FontShop or Myfonts)\r\n\r\nAnd now we have Ginkgo. Looks very similar
    to Dolly and it\u2019s fabbed in OpenType. Cheaper. Linotype or Fonts.com don\u2019t
    seem to let you preview the kerning, but did I forget to mention its CHEAPER?\u2014
    you can actually snatch this for about $94.  Oh and there\u2019s the thing you
    mentioned about the bold too. You even get a bold italic. The lowercase g has
    a more defined ear than the other two.\r\n\r\nI might have different design priorities
    than you do or quality expectations. Fonts that have poor spacing and kerning
    are always a big no-no for me, even if the paux pas lies with international characters.
    For some folks, such as an American user that will probably will not work with
    a letter beyond the alphabet, it might be fine. You might care more about convenience,
    you might like this or that... you get the idea. But the dollar or euro does seem
    to help us along with our decision making doesn\u2019t it? For $94 Ginkgo isn\u2019t
    looking that bad.\r\n\r\nThe point is that sooner or later someone is going to
    land on Ginkgo and buy it for whatever reason. Should they? I don\u2019t think
    so. Why? Because the like the graphic designer that\u2019s doing some serious
    comparison shopping, so does the type designer making his or her sketches. They
    ask themselves: \u201CHas this been done already?, Did I base my design on historical
    models, my own genius (like Unger), or is it a matter of \u2018I want to do look
    like XYZ foundry or XYZ font\u2014I want some of that business\u2019\u2019\u2019?
    \r\n\r\nGingko\u2019s type designer had to have known he was making something
    very close to Dolly and for the reasons stated in the other thread (I can really
    visualize Dolly behind Ginkgo), I don\u2019t think Ginkgo is a sincere attempt.
    I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any excuses left for the \u201Cme-too\u201D design.
    The font development cycle takes too much effort and time for an accident.\r\n\r\nMore
    wrinkles: \r\n\r\nThere have been designers who have asked or at least stated
    they were inspired by XYZ font and maybe even got the blessing of the foundry
    because wanted to try a variation on the original theme.[[http://www.macrhino.com/delicato.html
    | Delicato is an excellent example.]] I find that honorable.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m also
    okay with the type designer that explores another type designers styling but uses
    unique techniques [[http://typophile.com/node/60949 |St. Atmos]] is another excellent
    example. (Please correct me on my usage of the words technique and styling.)\r\n\r\nQuestions
    (some I\u2019ve asked before):\r\n\r\nWhen does a design turn from being a member
    of the same genre, into a competition design, into a derivative design, and then
    mostly gravely into a copy? \r\n\r\nIs it using a similar stylistic affection
    (like brushy foxtail terminals or blocky terminals) onto of a different skeleton
    or structure?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LucidaFax_6103.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ms_3806.png]\r\n\r\nIs
    it the other case: somewhat similar skeleton different details?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/droid_3703.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arrietta_3846.png]\r\n\r\nWhat
    about borrowing a glyph or two and making the rest different?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nassim_6089.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quartzo_6333.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nCould
    we say that Dolly originated the genre of brushy low contrast type?  \r\n\r\nWould
    that constitute Dolly as the historical model or prototype for all the following
    inspired works and should we view it the same way we would new release that\u2019s
    spin on the\u2014let\u2019s say\u2014the gerald genre?\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s more
    to add. But I\u2019ll let you talk amongst yourselves,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz"

    predates Dolly by at least a decade. Lexicon is far pricier, too\u2026 but it
    is just simply divine. Dolly is its own typeface, and I would never see it as
    a Lexicon-copy. To say that Dolly initiated the brush-terminal oldstyle serif
    genre is not the case. Even Lexicon is probably not the first example of this\u2026\r\n\r\nI
    think that Ginkgo is different from Dolly. But don't take my word for it! If it
    is different enough for this year's TDC judges to have selected it as one of the
    best typefaces that they saw in the competition, then that is good enough for
    me."

    imparts humor, friendliness, or even femininity. There is also a 3D quality to
    the serifs or slabs that Dolly started.\r\n\r\nThe except is Gingko, which I think
    does not on its own.\r\n\r\nEven though Lexicon has more contrast, I do see what

    In fact my biggest complaint about how most competitions are run is the hopelessly
    breakneck speed - it's almost like the point is raising money and publishing results,
    and the actual judging is a necessary evil.\r\n\r\nBut here's an idea that might
    allow competitions to gauge originality within the very short timeframe: a font
    jury could have an expert ID hound (chosen of course from the incomparable pack
    here) who would quickly identify a potentially too-close precedent and bring it
    to the attention of the entire jury on the spot. Of course that presumes the judging
    is NOT seen as a necessary evil, but instead something to be done delicately and
    diligently... just like type design itself.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
