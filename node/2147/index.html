<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Here's another lost French gem: <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/20898.gif alt=Jannet.gif> <br> <br>Just look at the superb elegant proportions, the great color, the modest but assured caps. <br>This really deserves much more attention than yet another Garamond revival. <br> <br>It's a 9 point from a series by Pierre Jannet, done around 1856. The scan is from a predictably wonderful article by Ovink in an old issue of Quaerendo, which also happens to have a reference to that superb Deberny font that came up in the Javal thread. Apparently there was a reaction to all the Didone typography during the bulk of the 19th century, and this design was one of the seminal works in the resultant "old-style" revival, which was however superceded by Morris's Arts & Crafts revival soon afterwards. Shame, since I think the A&C stuff was somewhat provincial, or at least naive. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>IMO the lowercase n, h, and u are a touch too narrow for the design. The y is a bit out of whack as well, no?</div>

<div class=commentbody>To me: the "h" is definitely too narrow (although I wouldn't make it the same width as the "n"), the "n" is fine, while the "u" is borderline. As for "y", that skewed thick arm does look funny, but ever since I saw it in that Deberny #17/#18* I've actually liked it. It seems to be a weight distribution scheme. <br> <br>* <a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Javal_18.gif target=_blank>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Javal_18.gif</a> <br>I'd make the "v" symmetrical however. <br> <br>The spacing though seems a bit loose in spots (although apparently this design was considered tight for its era), but being metal makes it harder to space with consistent tightness. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The foot serifs seem to droop down and to the right. Was Jannet a lefty? Cap proportions look eratic, but you'd need to see them all. The punctuation is monster (i like it). Hmmm interesting. I like the even weight and the smallish caps. <br> <br>Perhaps a Pierre et Pierre revival? One roman, the other italic? It has market potential. (though the italic would be twice as wide at the roman :-) BTW, does this already have italics with it? <br> <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>> Was Jannet a lefty? <br> <br>Dunno. This is the first time I'd ever even heard the guy's name. <br>But although this was a reaction against the "constructed" Didone trend, and a revival of a more chirographic past, it still looks "synthetic" to me (maybe because they couldn't stray <i>too</i> much from the spirit of that era), so I don't think they were "digitizing" any handwriting/calligraphy. <br> <br>BTW, the caps are supposed to be how mid-19th century Frenchies thought the Romans were supposed to have wanted to mahe them... Hard to explain - you'd really have to read the Ovink article(s). <br> <br>And yeah, I <i>love</i> that hefty apostrophe! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant <br> <br>You are right. That is a face that needs to be made available. <br> <br>This is not a criticism, but the entire face seems to be on the condensed side, with the exception of the fullish caps; at least the two shown. <br> <br>If the proof you included was initially 9 point or thereabouts, it seems to me that the set would be more than tight enough. I's be curious to see if the type's condensed (to my eye) feeling is evident at actual size. <br> <br>Where did you find the showing? I don't think I have ever run across the name Jannet. I will need to take a dig in my pile books. <br> <br>Thanks <br> <br>Jim Rimmer</div>

<div class=commentbody>> the entire face seems to be on the condensed side <br> <br>Yes, and it looks condensed in the flesh too. BTW, you could say that condensed type is typically French, no? I know that L Mandel thinks "real" French type must have a small x-height. <br> <br>Anyway, the showing is from G W Ovink's "Nineteenth-century reactions against the didone type model - II", the second in a three part treatise in Quaerendo (V1#2, V1#4 and V2#2). The section on Jannet is pp 287-290. <br> <br>Louis Perrin started the elzevir/old-style revival trend in the second quarter of the 19th century, then Jannet and another -Th</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, its well know here! ;-) It follow the trend started by Perrin. The Jannet Italic is very very nice. <br> <br>I gave that subject couple years ago to my type design students. They have done a strange but nice interpretation of it who give a completly different feeling in big size with its angular serifs but who still very round in small text size. Saddly no text showing online. <br> <br><a href=http://perso.ensad.fr/%7eensadtypo/fontes.html#jannet target=_blank>http://perso.ensad.fr/%7eensadtypo/fontes.html#jannet</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>It's of course not surprising you guys have known about this all along! I just wonder why nobody has revived any of that stuff (I do know that Ponot/IN made a digital version of Perrin's designs - but the Perrin sample in the Ovink article isn't very encouraging to me - Jannet's stuff is gold). It really seems that the second half of the 19th century is an untapped fountain (sorry for the bad joke). It makes me think: Mais </div>

<div class=commentbody>What you mean by <br>"the elzevir stuff isn't really the same as Morris's." <br> <br>For Ponot, Mandel and others, Perrin and Jannet are the first revival of Old Style typefaces, long long before Morris and others. Just that part of history generally don't appear on standard Anglo-US typography books. <br> <br>For Perrin its pretty clear, as described by Ponot in its 2 books. He wanted typefaces who by its forms reflect old text he want to publish. 19th typefaces don't fitted well, so he tried to find old typefaces, and used one existing old italic, and designed a Roman lc to fit with. Its caps are already done to do the titling for his HUGE book on Roman Lyon Inscriptions. I describe the Italic as a pure Garalde, when the Roman is more an Incised Garalde, perhaps the first text face of the category at this time? <br> <br>Perrin was one of the first typefaces revival done at the original ANCT (Imprimerie nationale), roughly 1987 by Jean Renaud Cuaz and Ronan Le Henaff under the direction of Mandel. Then, later later, the Imprimerie Nationale asked to Franck Jalleau, their in-house type designer to do a digital version who is used ONLY in the Ponot book you refer. <br> <br>About Jannet, there is less stuff about it. Gerard unger refered to it several time, as a French "Gout Hollandois"! <br>I have here a couple of Biblioth</div>
