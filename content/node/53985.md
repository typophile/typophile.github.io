body: "Hello everyone,\r\nI was wondering if there are any nice serif typefaces that
  feature a single story 'g' (not italic).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions / information would
  be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSam "

  body: I think I've read somewhere that Wallpaper used a Plantin with an alternative
    single story "g" (and it also had a single story "a").

    you read that? Or what year it may have been?\r\nI had a look in a few issues
    but couldn't see a signs of single story 'g'."

    or <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/fedra_serif_phonetic\">Fedra Serif
    Phonetic</a> will have \u0261, or 'Latin Small Letter Script G', which is a single
    storey 'g' and is the symbol used to represent the hard 'g' sound. They will also
    have \u0251, or 'Latin Small Letter Alpha', which is a single storey 'a' and is
    the symbol used to represent the first vowel in 'father'."

  body: "That's a legitimate concern, so one should really try it out first to see
    if they work well as alternates for g and a. I took a quick look at the character
    sets for Fedra Serif, but I don't think single-storey alternates for g and a are
    provided; the \u0261 and \u0251 were probably created just as phonetic symbols."
