  body: The direction the flourish comes off the b is contrary to how a scribe would
    pull a flourish from a lowercase b. That's why it seems off. You could have it
    come into the downstroke of the b from the natural direction of writing (R to
    L; Top to Bottom) and still loop around to center the flourish. That being said
    the first sample is better; in that the top and bottom flourishes work together
    better.

  body: Thanks Stephen. Good observation on the directional aspect... I'll look at
    some ways to work the flourish in from right to left. Cheers!

  body: Have you tried connecting the bottom terminal of the S around to the bottom
    flourish?  It could help tie things together even more.  And maybe consider ball
    terminals on the flourishes too?  Or some other strategy to bring a bit more unity
    to the style.
