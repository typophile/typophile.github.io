		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, first, I thought, after 24 hours, to get some &lsquo;constructive&rsquo; critisism. Things like ' I really don&rsquo;t like Serpentine' don&rsquo;t help me - &lsquo;Mountain Dew&rsquo;??? Sorry, doesn&rsquo;t say anything to me, maybe because I am on the other side. Why is Serpentine not right (I think it is a nice &lsquo;speedy&rsquo; font) and which one would be more appropriate??
&lsquo;They’re spaced too far apart from each other in all of these examples&rsquo; - that is something to work with. I will change this, but closing in leaves me no choice than to lift the text and get it a little bit between the &lsquo;balls&rsquo;, which make it uneven somehow.
&lsquo;The sentiment behind the concept is very dated and the solution looks obvious - by that i mean I have no confidence that you’ve put much thought into it&rsquo; - yes, I did research, but it is difficult to come with something brandnew in this segment.
I did the basics in Freehand as it is for me very difficult to sketch on paper. The ideas are in my head. but I can them realise better with a program than with &lsquo;bare&rsquo; hand. My Freehand docs looks like sketches, so&hellip; :)
Any other suggestions??</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

Sometimes some-ones personal opinion triggers some-one else his.
I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about this.</p>
<p>Since you are working on a logo I would loose the shadows.
Remember that things have to be printed, placed on websites, cars, stationary &hellip;
often
Shadows are a pain then. Beside that, they often don&rsquo;t add anything. It often brings an amateuristic feel with it. It is often a way of adding something interesting.</p>
<p>What is your reason of putting it there?</p>
<p>And, what is your reason to choose for yellow?</p>
<p>I would try and look for an other font. Personaly I do like serpentine, but I hardly ever use it because it feels outdated. It has become a bit cheapy. Exception are outthere.</p>
<p>This together with the logo in front of it, it is not a memorable logo.</p>
<p>You say you have difficulty in sketching on paper. Often this does open new doors.
Research, look what is out there and not te be missed: what kind of company is it? Translate that into a logo and I think the one you have now doesn&rsquo;t suit anymore.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>:)) That&rsquo;s more like what I expected.</p>
<p>To Bobby:
About the font: ok, I am a little bit short at fonts, and there is no way I purchase them for 150$ or more just for demonstration. So, I have to go with what I have. Sure, I like fonts like Futura, Helvetica, Frutiger, Garamond, and so on, but most of the times my clientel doesn&rsquo;t like them as they are too &lsquo;simple&rsquo; (that&rsquo;s what customer say - I prefer &lsquo;timeless&rsquo;). So they want something out of the row. Maybe you have some suggestions for fonts I could use or would be more appropiate.
About the shadow, yes, I know, but that&rsquo;s why there is a b/w version at the bottom.
Orange, I think is still a color which attract attention without alarming.
To Aziz:
About connecting the font. yes, I thought of this, but isn&rsquo;t it too much. And there is the problem with direct.com, that it doesn&rsquo;t make sense there to connect the fonts. But both logos should look as a unit.
If I let lead the arrows to the circle, it wouldn&rsquo;t have the same impression like the &lsquo;connect&rsquo; version and so the unity goes.
to Ross:
The company is in the hotel-booking and travel business (and no, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any hotel or house icons in the logo). There will be an addition in the front, like &lsquo;Bali-connect.com&rsquo; or &lsquo;Bali-direct.com&rsquo; (just as an example). The icon will then finally move to the other side.
Thanks for all your comments.</p>
