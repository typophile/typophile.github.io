body: "Hi! I'm in search of the typeface used for signage all over Venezia, as the
  one showed in the picture. In the last Biennale di Architettura, designer John Morgan
  used it as inspiration for the biennale posters and branding typeface. It sure is
  much like Didot, but then is worked as stencil, like Charrette (which is mainly
  associated with Le Corbusier) and which is heavier and thicker than the one used
  in Venezia... I've done a basic search and found no information on the matter. Could
  you please help me out? \r\nThank you all!"

    I got the impression that there were several styles of templates that changed
    over the years. Also I have seen these kind of stencil street name signs i other
    places in northern Italy, so I think that there are many different styles of this
    lettering. Chopping up Bodoni-like typefaces for stencil-usage may be typical
    for northern Italy as from the second half of the 18th century, but the way the
    idea is executed may vary by signpainter and by stencil-supplier, so I don\u2019t
    think that there is one style of stencil lettering that is typical to Venice \u2026"

  body: As you can see in <a href="http://www.labiennale.org/doc_files/exhibition-maps.pdf">this
    PDF</a>, the Biennale font is called JMSNiziolettiBeta7. JMS stands for <a href="http://www.morganstudio.co.uk/">John
    Morgan Studio</a>. Nizioletti is the Venetian name of these street signs. You
    can find some more information about all that <a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/common-ground-a-letter-from-venice">here</a>.

    exclusively done for the occasion. Better samples:\r\n- http://www.flickr.com/photos/ulri_que/8153613946/\r\n-

    I have to recreate it, I'd probably start with some high-contrasted display/headline
    such as [[http://www.identifont.com/show?8LT|Big Caslon]], [[http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/freight_big|Freight
    Big]] or [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/chronicle-display/overview|Chronicle

    Floda]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typonine/ty-stencil-pro|Typonine Stencil]],

  body: "Thanks R for the links to the pdf and Eye Magazine's article on John Morgan's
    creation of a new version of Venice stencil signage. Very interesting project.
    And I learned a new word -- Nizioletti. As for the degree to which John Morgan
    drew on an existing font or fonts it should be possible to decide by reference
    to:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VeniceStencil_4559.jpg]\r\nDon"
