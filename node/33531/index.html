  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Typophiles,

After years of talking about a spiral-based curve editing tool, the provisional patent application is filed, and I've made an unpolished release of the stuff I have now. Brave souls can check it out to see what I've been talking about. Others among you may choose to wait until there's a release that's not quite as spartan.

<!--break-->

I made a Mac build, but loading and saving is more or less not implemented (you can kinda make it work using the commandline, but it really needs a file dialog). Background images (for tracing) are not supported yet either.

The solver has also not been tuned for numerical robustness, so when you play around with it, you'll often see it fail to solve the spline. It does work reliably when the pattern plate represents a real font shape rather than random points, though.

It's free software (GPL), and patches for improvements are greatly appreciated.

		<div class="commentbody">Congratulations on your release, Raph!  Good luck with writing your dissertation---I look forward to reading the math behind these curves.

You might also want to mention on your web page that ppedit compiles on Linux (and from looking at the Makefile, probably Windows, too).  For those who don't want to compile ppedit to try it themselves, let me describe the basics:

Curves are drawn with curve, corner, and tangent points as normal, but there are only on-curve points---no off-curve points.  The shape of the interpolated spline can be changed by adding more points to the curve and then moving them.  Moving a point added to a Bezier curve is a pain, because then all of the off-curve control points have to be recalculated to make the curve smooth.  However, Raph's program recalculates the spline to be smooth as you move the point (this is made easier by using the Cornu spirals, from my understanding), so that you always have a smooth curve.  It's actually more intuitive than I thought it would be, but it still takes some getting used to.

@guifa: if you want to try your hand at adding open/save dialogs, that would be appreciated (currently, Apple-S just saves into a file called "plate"). Just make sure any Mac-specific code is bracketed by #ifdef X3_CARBON, so it doesn't break the Linux build.

The solver is known not to be numerically stable when the angles get big. If you stick with small angles, those pretty but unuseful spirals won't happen. I'm working on a more stable solver, but it's not ready yet. This stuff <em>is</em> rocket science, literally - the math I'm using is based on the calculus of variations, which has applications in computing optimal trajectories for spacecraft.

@hrant: Inconsolata was designed entirely using these spirals, as was Christian Gothic and pretty much all of my work-in-progress for the last year or so. The .plate files for Inconsolata are all posted.

On the Mac, you can open a .plate file by going to the directory containing ppedit.app, and typing  "./ppedit.app/Contents/MacOS/ppedit u.plate". Obviously, a real Open dialog would be much more useful.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/u_5308.png]

@sgh: the Windows port is started, but far from complete. I probably won't finish it myself, because I've lately become more interested in porting the code to a web app.

@clauses: I'm not able (due to time constraints) to do any of that kind of integration work myself, but would be happy to help others do so. In the case of Fontlab compatibility, for you to be able to edit interactively inside the app, they'd probably need to license the technology. A plug-in or a batch-mode converter could probably be done as a separate module, though, which would be compatible with the free GPL licensing terms.

And there's been talk of using the UFO format as a container for the curves, similar to the .plate file but in XML. (It's said that XML is for people who feel that Lisp doesn't have enough parentheses).

@jpad: I would <em>love</em> that, of course.

Because I'm starting at Google in a couple weeks, I won't be beating the bushes myself to push this technology out into the world. To a large extent, I'm "throwing the technology over the fence." It's an opportunity to see what the community can do with it, both in the free software world (it's being demoed today at LGM in Montreal), and whether users can generate enough interest and excitement to spur proprietary vendors to pony up for a license. It is my experience that companies tend to be <em>extremely</em> reluctant to do such things. I'd like to be proven wrong, but that's the main reason I'm taking a job in the advertising industry rather than trying to make a go on my own with technology licensing.

There are menu options for changing betwixt corner and curve points, etc.  With those hooks, it could definitely open up some interesting possibilities if it can be made into a framework, which would still (I'd think) remain quite platform independent as well as make it more accessible to other developers for any number of other applications besides just font-design.  If I'm rambling a bit excuse me, it is cinco de mayo (well, now it's seis de mayo).

It's not a problem if you see it for what it is: a combination of glyph descriptor and RIP. But a very real -and somewhat related- problem of Metafont is its foundation on the theory that letters should have skeletons. This is a naive, primitive and fatal fallacy, and one at the heart of chirography as well. It's the reason Computer Modern looks so crappy.

You'll find that the code is factored to be quite modular, but perhaps not quite in the way that you'd expect. Writing truly cross-platform apps is hard. If I didn't care about that, I'd have done this as a Cocoa app, in Objective C, using NIB's. As it is, the UI is built procedurally, and there's a layer (x3) which translates that into the code for Carbon or Gtk+2. (it could do Windows too; that's a Small Matter of Programming).

So, for example, the menu item for "delete point" is created thus:

<code>    x3menuitem(menu, "Delete Point", "delp", "&lt;cmd&gt;d");
</code>

The point is that you don't have to do redo all the UI work for each platform. An earlier version (see carbon_main.c) did load a NIB, and that was ok, but I like it better the way it is now.

@abattis: <em>It is compatible with FontForge’s SFD</em>

Not really. There's a batch-mode converter that spits out .sfd files. It's certainly doable to write a batch-mode converter for (cubic Bezier flavor) UFO's, or whatever FontLab accepts most natively. Given that FontLab is Python-scriptable, it should also be quite feasible to  write a non-interactive import plugin that can be selected from the UI. In other words, an "import spiro plate" menu item.

There are different levels of compatibility. Batch-mode conversion is the lowest, interactive editing with lossless round-trip is the highest. If people seriously want to use these tools in production, anything less than that is a time-waster.

And as for FontForge, it kinda works for me, but there are lots of features of FontLab I miss, like stroke offset that isn't horribly buggy, Python scripting, a sane UI for OpenType contextual programming, etc. I've also had to fix a few bugs in it. Fortunately, because I am a rocket scientist, I can do that, but for most type designers, I think the experience will be less than fulfilling.

@hrant: <em>problem of Metafont is its foundation on the theory that letters should have skeletons.</em>

Metafont doesn't force you into that mode. The Computer Modern fonts are all defined as strokes, but AMS Euler is done more or less using the same technology as Adobe Type 1. Of course, Euler doesn't have any of the optical scaling or variation features either.

@clauses: The real power of Spiro comes out when you combine the spline fitter with techniques for variation. I have some ideas on this, which I will write up soon. My experiments thus far have been very encouraging, suggesting that it will be <em>much</em> easier to use than Multiple Master technology. Here's an experiment I did with linear interpolation of the control points to blend a weight axis:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/interp_seq_4134.png]

The advantage of this technique is that all of the blends are guaranteed to have smooth curvature too. Using Beziers, in the general case, there's no guarantee of smoothness of any kind.</div>

The variation angle you mention seems very interesting, although
I don't get exactly why spirals would be better at it than beziers.

Do you really mean that?
1) I thought it can't be lossless.
2) It really only has to be one-way to be sufficiently useful.

		<div class="commentbody">@hrant: <cite>Metafont does support outlining and not just expanded strokes, but the only real reason to use Metafont is its parametric abilities, and (please correct me if I’m wrong) these only work with strokes.</cite>

MetaPost (essentially MetaFont for Postscript) supports outlines, and of course since everything is scriptable, parametric abilities are available to work with strokes. <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/metatype1/">MetaType1</a> is a set of MetaPost macros that makes it easy to make a CFF-based font (Type1 or CFF-flavored OTF).  My font <a href="http://typophile.com/node/31970">Aurulent Sans</a> is being developed using MetaType1.  The use of a weight parameter can be seen when comparing the regular and bold weights.

<cite>What would be amazing is if somehow we could use parametrics with outlines; even more amazing would be a GUI for that!</cite>

The ability to script is much more powerful than just the parametrics, and GUIs aren't very good for representing scripts.  If you're just interested in the parametrics, then it might be possible to represent them graphically, but here the main problem is that the dimension of the parameter space is probably too high to represent visually in a meaningful form.

Maybe I'm not getting you, but for a font that's meant

But FontLab has the former, but not the latter,

		<div class="commentbody">@hrant: <cite>So has anybody designed a MetaPost outline font where the x-height is parametric?</cite>

x-height is a parameter in Aurulent Sans, and I imagine it is as well in other MetaType1-designed fonts, such as Antykwa Toruńska, Antykwa Półtawskiego, Kurier, and Iwona.

<cite>The question is (and this might be difficult to answer) was it worth the effort, compared to a “plain” interpolation setup in FontLab?</cite>

To me, scripting the outline of a glyph is MUCH easier than drawing it graphically.  I find it much easier to say "Put point A here.  Put point B here.  Put point C here. Put point D 1/3 of the way between B and C. Draw a smooth curve from A to D to E, etc".  That way I don't have to worry about whether the curve is smooth or not, where to put control points, etc.  (Well, that's a bit of lie, often I need to give MetaType1 a little bit more help, but not too often.)  And if the width changes, or the x-height changes, then the position of point A, etc is automatically recalculated when the scripts are run again.

<cite>The ability to script is much more powerful than just the parametrics</cite>

<cite>But FontLab has the former, but not the latter,
so the valuable sort of power is in the latter.</cite>

I have never used FontLab, so I don't know its scripting language.  However, based on your comment, it sounds like it is not as powerful as MetaType1.  Can you do the type of outline construction I described above?  The parametric power comes from using the parameters in the construction.  Of course, it is also (somewhat) difficult to create construction scripts that capture parameters.  See this <a href="http://typophile.com/node/29008">discussion</a> and this <a href="http://typophile.com/node/29008">discussion</a> for thoughts on why a more parametric approach has not been more frequently used.

		<div class="commentbody">@abattis: <em>Python scripting got added to FontForge last week</em>

That's seriously cool news. I can still imagine that most professional type designers would rather use FontLab though.

@hrant: <em>&gt; the dimension of the parameter space is probably too high to represent visually</em>

Computer Modern has something on the order of 60 parameters for things ranging from the obvious ascender/descender height to more subtle things like the parameters for the serifs. That's a very high dimensionality of the parameter space, even if the <em>amount</em> of the change is subtle.

The key to making variation work for people who don't have advanced computer science degrees is to keep the number of dimensions down. Here's an outline of my ideas for that:

1. For optical scaling, use stroke offset for the bulk of the effect, with a little optional squooshing.

2. For things like ascender and descender lengths, allow points to be put on <em>frames</em> which can move independently of the main em. So, then, to lengthen descenders, pull the descender frame (global to the font) down.

3. For everything else, do interpolation. My gut feeling is that 2-dimensional interpolation (the corners of a quadrilateral) is the most that is intuitive to work with, and, if you can keep it to one, that's even better.

The number of active frames in any one glyph should be no more than three or so. The main thing interpolation is used for is weight (like the above image).

Also note that one of the most important aspects of optical scaling is the spacing and kerning. That can probably be done using simple interpolation between a "big" and a "little" size.

You seem to be saying that parametric design cannot be done with FontLab's scripting tools.  As I mentioned, I have never used FontLab, so I have no idea what the actual capability is.  Just because FontLab uses Python, though, does not mean that the FontLab Python interface allows the needed operations.  Possibly more importantly, is whether the interface makes it easy to design glyphs parametrically.  

Here's an easy test for someone who knows Python scripting in FontLab:  given the parameters of width, cap height, left and right side-bearing, vertical stroke width, and horizontal stroke width, draw a sans serif uppercase H.  Then draw an uppercase O.  If this can be done easily, then FontLab scripting has the potential for parametric design.

		<div class="commentbody">Did anyone ever get to play around with FontChameleon Pro before it was pulled from public consumption? Voices seem to rave about how fantastic it was. I guess it was not fully parametric, but relied to some extent on some predesigned endpoint to interpolate from? The reason I'm thinking about it is the fact that a number of parametric type engines have come and gone through the years. There is Metafont, FontChameleon, Incubator(?), LiveType and some HP stuff i forgot the name of. Why where they never successful? I can certainly understand why Metafont never went of the ground as it's made for the programmer and not for the designer (correct me if I'm wrong here). Is this parametric approach simply too complicated for the designer to take anywhere, or was it just the lack of GUI that kept it off? FontChamelon seemed to go all the way to the user, skipping the designer, which was it's point I guess.

No, I don't know enough to say either way (and I don't see how I implied otherwise). On the other hand Python being a fully capable language shouldn't have a problem. The real problem is that there's not enough money in type for something that hard to happen, at least not quickly.

> whether the interface makes it easy to design glyphs parametrically.

To most people that means a GUI, and the answer is definitely
No in the case of FontLab... but really just as No for anything else.

Let's say "skagy" varying from a pretty small to a pretty large x-height.

FontChameleon: I think I had a copy once, didn't get to really use it, and
then something quite mysterious happened and we've become deprived.

Sorry about the delay in doing this, but I was traveling and then forgot about it.  I've posted a sample that shows varying x-height in Aurulent Sans in that font's <a href="http://typophile.com/node/31970">critique</a>.  The amount of time it took me was changing one line and hitting recompile.  The tricky part was figuring out how to install several different versions of the same font. :)

The ability to change basic parameters globally over the entire font is quite nice, but it does require planning the scripts (somewhat) carefully.  For instance, I can't push the x-height much over 600, because then the script that generates the question mark barfs.  Of course, as Hrant pointed out, it's presumed that the parameters won't vary too much from the value in mind when the scripts are written.

Basically, if you're a type designer and want to have this kind of curve drawing tool in a production environment, you have four choices:

1. Learn to code and do it yourself.

2. Show some love to the free software community, and encourage them to integrate it into their leading design apps (Inkscape, FontForge).

3. Lobby the proprietary app vendors to license it.

4. Sit on your @ss and hope somebody else does 1-3.

Looking at some internet sites, it seems that the most widely used French Curves are composed of sections of parabolas, hyperbolas, and elipses. These are all conic sections, can be described by quadratic equations, and hence can be drawn perfectly by quadratic bezier curves.  

The Cornu spirals here are different. If I understand it rightly, sections between knots cannot be drawn accurately with either a *single* quadratic or cubic curve, though of course they can be approximated with multiple curves of either type.     

I don't know if the Cornu spiral is on any French Curves. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, as I explained in the other thread, it's not about evaluating the results out of context, it's about how much effort Raph's method saves. Whether Rodrigo's "S" is better or worse than Christian's is irrelevant; the point is to consider how much effort each of them saved in getting to that in-some-way satisfactory result.

Why does one have to wait 9+ years to be told something this relevant!  :-/
When you think about it though I guess it's common sense. Aaah, hindsight!

BTW, what exactly is the traditional "S" test?

> ... can be drawn perfectly by quadratic bezier curves.

Yet once more: it's not about this being possible
or not, it's about this being worth doing or not.
"Perfectly" should not come into the discussion.

It's possible to go to the grocery store crawling on
your back, naked. This does not make it worth doing.
And the "imperfection" of using a car, a bicycle or
your feet does not make any of those a bad idea.

> The drawing took about 8 minutes, and there are a total of 50 points.

Now this is getting relevant. How much time would it take you to do it with beziers? It would be useful here to ask David to time himself with both methods too, since you'd like to get the view form both ends: somebody used to drawing with cornus more and somebody used to drawing with beziers more.

Also, some overlays would be very useful, since your "thresh" and "optim" settings don't mean anything to us. An overlay of the spiral original over the converted bezier, and one of the end result black shape over the original piece of plastic. Please?  :-)

That implies cornus are better when you're starting out in type design; but an equally important issue is: for somebody with experience with beziers, would you say they're about the same in the end, or do cornus have an advantage there too?

> 3. Lobby the proprietary app vendors to license it.

To me adding cornu support seems like just the ticket to encourage upgrades to FontLab 6... In fact right this minute they might be desperately trying to figure out how to add value to their product to keep the upgrade money coming! That said, an email campaign by users can only help.

BTW Raph: what term should we be using for this - cornus, spirals, or what?
Something short would be great.

David will correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I understand from a conversation with Mike Parker, the traditional test administered to someone applying for employment in the Linotype drawing office, in the "good ol' days," was the task of reproducing freehand (I'm talking about drawing here -- pencils and paper, you know) a specific 'S' from a given model typeface, in order to gauge their innate talent and skill. 

I don't know if it was the same 'S' each time, or if there was a time limit.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fc-339-overlay_6327.png]

The Bezier version is a 1px red stroke, and the spiral version is on top in black. You can see a teeny difference on the left hand of the top curve. If you tweak the "thresh" parameter, it'll add more Beziers to make the error go as small as you like. I picked the .01 number as the default for my work because the error is just below the threshold of what you can see when you look at the shapes side-by-side. Setting it to .001 adds nine beziers (for a total of 52), and the visual difference becomes undetectable even when zoomed. Btw, if you want to zoom in on the above comparison, I put up a <a href="http://levien.com/spiro/fc-339-overlay.pdf">PDF</a>.

I tried overlaying the black-filled version over the original photo, but I couldn't get anything that seemed as clear as the first image above, partly because of the low contrast of the original. I have done the same thing with letters - maybe I should post some images from that?

<em>what term should we be using for this - cornus, spirals, or what?</em>

I kinda like "spirals". Cornu spirals are actually only one case. The most general case is a third order polynomial spiral, which I sometimes abbreviate "spiro". Incidentally, Cornu didn't invent the spiral bearing his name, Euler did, so they should really be called "Euler spirals".

<em>How much time would it take you to do it with beziers?</em>

Well, for me to do it wouldn't exactly be fair, because I want my tools to win. But I'd be very interested to learn how long it takes <em>you,</em> Hrant, and whether you're as satisfied with the technical quality.

Actually, what I think I'd like to do is pose a real challenge. Maybe a neutral Typophile person (Tiff? Stephen?) could serve as moderator. It would go something like this: the moderator selects a high quality image of a predigital glyph, something like 1000px square, and posts it at a pre-arranged time. Then, people post followups to that thread containing their best shot, using the tools of their choice - Spiro, Illustrator, FontLab, QB's, CB's, IkarusMaster, whatever. Reports of drawing time can be verified by the post timestamp, and then the moderator would judge the quality.

Sound like fun? I would write up the results in a section of my thesis, as part of the case I'm trying to make is that spirals are more intuitive, more productive, and more conducive to high-quality results. Going up against the best skills of Typophiles would be a real way to falsifiably test those claims.

Oh.
Well goldangit then that's plenty close enough!

It's nice to see that such a close approximation
doesn't result in an infestation of vertices.

What does the "optim" setting do?

Concerning an overlay of the physical French curve and your end-result, we don't really need the former, we just need the original (1-bit) shape you started with. But if you think the threshold for that is as tight as the first overlay, don't bother.

> Cornu didn’t invent the spiral bearing his name, Euler did

Well, and apparently Pierre didn't invent beziers, Paul de Casteljau did, but these things can stick and trying to unstick them distracts from true work! On the other hand Euler was da man (as Laplace* found out the hard way) and it's early days so maybe we can do something.

* Or was it somebody else? I'm vaguely it might have been an Englishman instead. Whoever it was invented some polynomial math, and then found out it was merely a special case of something Euler had done long before!

Yeah, me too. Windows version please!

Your broader challenge sounds fun and relevant.
But no need to bother with formal timekeeping - we can trust us.

It's a speed/optimization tradeoff. At zero, it's interactively fast but generates about three times as many Beziers as is needed. At three, it (currently) takes about a minute, but generates something like the absolute most optimized cubic Bezier representation possible for the curve. The main thing it's doing at level 3 is exhaustively searching all points along the curve to find the best points to break - at the lower levels, it just splits the curve in half whenever a single Bezier is not sufficient. There'll be more detail in my thesis, of course.

<em>But no need to bother with formal timekeeping - we can trust us.</em>

I think we can too, but I'd like to remove as many variables that could spoil the results as I can.

This part of the code is very rough and unfinished. When you press Apple-S, it saves the file "plate" into the file system, into the current directory, not sure exactly where that is by default on a mac. (a quick test reveals that it seems to go into / , which is not friendly behavior). Similarly, when you press Apple-P, it saves a PostScript file to /tmp/foo.ps. I then use some command-line scripts (mostly written in Python) to optimize the Beziers, etc. These scripts ship in the spiro tarball, but not in the ppedit.dmg disk image.

Dave Crossland (abattis) is planning on writing better documentation soon, which I think will be very helpful.

It seems to be flexible enough to allow the fine tuning I want, but right now, I'm so acclimated to beziers that I'd need more time to get used to the different behavior. I couldn't necessarily compare my drawing speed between Beziers and spirals because most of my actual design work is spent adjusting existing outlines. I don't do a lot of revivals, and I don't do big finished drawings anymore, so the speed at which I can digitize an outline isn't a big factor. Major editing happens after the first round of proofs. I can already slap an outline together in bezier format in record time. It's not finished no matter how much I fuss over it initially. 

Raph, I don't want to rain on your challenge, but this means I can't gauge quality or speed based on immediate digitization results; it's very iterative, and "accuracy" isn't my concern, rightness of design is, which is revealed with testing and use.</div>

My subjective experience is that Spiro is extremely good for making fine edits. You can tweak points around without having to worry about technical details like extremal points, and, in general, the changes "make sense". I've done quite a bit of this with both my revivals and my original designs (Inconsolata and Cecco). The warm, fuzzy feeling that I get when drawing has done a lot to motivate me to go more deeply into the math behind the curves, so that I know at multiple levels that the curves are "right."

At some point, you go beyond what can be quantified, and into the realm of what it <em>feels</em> like to use the tool. I'm hoping that enough people spend enough time playing with it that I can start to get more insight into that, in addition to my own personal experience.

This I don't get. You don't <cite>have</cite> to worry about extrema when you're doing bezier drawing either - you can add those in later, which furthermore is something you'd have to do with/after spiral-to-bezier conversion anyway.

Carl I tend to agree. The S-test is not quantitative enough, I mean, what will it show? That some people drew the outline to be the 'right' design, so that it looked right independently from the scan. While others tried to make it very close to the scan, while again others tried to make the curves look very smooth?

The proof is in the making of great looking type – fast. With all the complications of automatized interpolation, with all it's stretching, squeezing, tilting and embolding. I have the feeling that the true value of designing in spirals lies in the automatization of these things, which leads me back to my earlier fantasies about Metafont. So Hrant, when you say that the idea that letters should have skeletons is fatal, what do you mean? Others are welcome to enlighten me on this as well.</div>

I know it's hard (I  mean I personally know!) to not think in this way, but you simply cannot arrive at "ideal" (which does not remotely mean "perfect") text type by thinking in terms of skeletons.

I feel the same way. It's not getting it, it's getting it right. At least for me, I have to do this by trial and error, both to see how the glyph works with the rest of the face, to find a 'sweet' curve, and to see how it works at intended size. What would be great is if you get to 'sweet' quicker or more naturally with the spirals. I suspect this is so, at least for some situations, but of course I don't know. 

By the way, I remember reading that Matthew Carter said something like "Watching me design a typeface would be like watching a freezer freeze ice cubes."  That is, the process involves so much incremental change, much of which might not mean much to someone else, but it is intense and dramatic to the designer. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not seeing how the intensity/speed with which a person works has make-or-break relevance here. Sure, some people will find spirals less intuitive, but among those who find them more intuitive the practical benefits will come, either when you're digitizing, or when you're tweaking. Yes, some people do more observation/thought in between the design iterations, but you still have to tweak the outlines in the end! And if a new tool makes creation and/or tweaking more "natural" then it's nominally worth using.

The practical question really is, lacking full integration
into something like FontLab, would it still be worth it?

		<div class="commentbody">There's another factor, beyond which is faster or more intuitive. Any time you allow an algorithm to determine a curve for you, it will influence what the design looks like. Bezier curves can describe almost any shape, if you add enough anchor/control points, but they become difficult to manage very quickly once you start adding points beyond the extremes.

As a result most type designers don't add that many points resulting in predictable curves. What percentage of type these days use control points *only* at the extremes of the curves? A lot. How many designs born in the bezier age have slightly tapered stems? Not many. Why? Because it's harder to draw that way. Here the medium influences the message.

From my short experience with these curves, it is much easier to manage additional knots, which means that lazy type designers like me will likely add more. The resulting designs will look at least different from the current batch if not more creative.

If it doesn't go into FontLab, though, I'm unlikely to use it :( I might give FontForge another try if it goes in there, though, even though X11 on OS X is gross.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">An interesting side point, Raph, is that <a href="http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics&id2=&id3=&id4=&id5=&idpic=03#pictloader">in the Underware 'Type Basics'</a> they explicitly compare good straight-to-curve outlines as a path like driving around a curve in a car. 

According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_integral">wikipedia article on Cornu spirals</a>, the Cornu spiral is actually used to lay railroad tracks going from straight to curve, because it is in one way the 'ideal' for this purpose. Apparently it is the only curve in which the rate of change in radius is constant. This means that there is a  continuous linear increase in the centrifugal force of the train laterally against the tracks. This linearity helps preserve the track, as well as jostle the passengers around less.

Anyway I found it interesting that this analogy of moving around a bend is already discussed in type design, and relates to the Cornu spiral. </div>

The Underware stuff though is corny (pardon the pun :-) because beziers don't have that attribute and they're basically just having fun.

Another interesting angle is that Renault (where P Bezier worked) apparently chose beziers over cornus. Now, that was for the design of bodywork and not test track design or something, but I wonder what their reason was for not going with such an industry precedent. Maybe beziers are computationally much lighter, or maybe they wanted to "invent" something New, as managers too often want to.

I think this is an excellent point. It ought to be discussed more often generally. It's hard enough to get full control of Beziers, and unfortunately too many type designers can't separate their design choices from their digital construction choices. Many of Emigre's types, even the recent classic revivals or homages, have this 'digital' gloss.  

I do indeed welcome an outline format that doesn't seem to favor grid-based alignment. I know very intimately why rasterization is a major concern in imaging type, but I do think, as Christian says, this kind of thing should not have the influence that it currently has on the design process. Unless a design is being made specifically for low-res use, I'd rather focus on truly ideal node placement and efficient, precise editing, rather than accommodating extrema. 

I will need to spend more time drawing with this tool in order to get used to the way the curves work and feel. Therefore, I need to have the tool built into, or accessible in, my current workflow (I don't have time to experiment in a separate environment). Raph, I would prefer to find this drawing environment as an option in FL, FOG, DTL FontMaster or other commercial product.</div>

Matter of opinion. I think you should consider this carefully. Since type is evolved from written language, it's a lot easier to use chirographic type than type made from geometric modules. When I say "digital gloss" it refers not only to the finish but the structure and the approach to letter- and type-building. Losing every element of chirography that has led to printed language (which is indeed very much a concern, look around) is much less preferable than losing technological constraints. When the tools have no influence, you can still make any kind of typeface, from radically reformist to traditional (or some combination thereof?...).</div>

My impression is that they have the major market share, and given all the Fontographer pining that goes on here, transitioning to another program is something type designers are pretty resistant too, even if cornu's are better.

I agree with Christian's interest in designing without the bezier propesity to become more unrully the more points you add. We've both talked about this in other threads before. (That said, using the FL interpolate tool instead of simply moving points is a decent work around for curves with many points).

Carl and Hrant: the chirography issue is actually something I struggle with, as I want the computer to do exactly what my hand does. Although type design has made me pretty comfortable with Bezier drawing, I still am most comfortable with ink and a brush. My latest type experiments have been trying to find the happy medium by taking my actual vectors from ink on paper. Still trying to find the right balance.

Raph: Matthew mentioned this earlier—but I'm having the same control issues with the Mac.

I can't figure out where comman-S saves the "plate" file, but the PostScipt file is pretty easy to find: Choose "Go to a folder..." from the Go menu in the Finder. Type "/tmp/ and hit return. The file called "foo.ps" is the PostScript file that is created when you hit command-P. Rename this before you generate a new one. It can be opened in Illustrator (or whatever).

It stands to reason that where a curve-fitting routine finds inflection points might be diagnostic of contrast type. And it seems to me that one of the things we ought to want to get a handle on is the logic of contrast in a co-ordinated glyph set. (But this might be where points of view diverge: that following such a logic is contributory to readability.) 

My visual argument suggested perhaps spiro has an advantage over beziers in providing this. But even in the bezier environment finding extermata can be revelatory of stress axis and diagnostic of it's consistency or pattern of departures.</div>

Peter, I would say not. The "logic" of almost anything in type design tends to be very occasional, inconsistent, and useless if followed too completely. From serif length to contrast to bowl shape to stress angle, these things tend to look bad and function badly when systematized too completely. Greek and Arabic types especially would not take well to this logical approach or analysis.

I agree, but a consistent contrast scheme will be in evidence I should think, and this has an overall impact on the root mathametical structure of the curves, which then becomes unique--in a deep-structure sense--to that typeface.</div>

My view is opposed even here, even before you get to the part about readability. To me we need all the help we can get to ween ourselves off of chirography, and a tool that's poorly coordinated with chirography is preferable to the opposite.

I'm seeing the opposite, since spirals apparently have less of a dependency on extrema. There's also another potential way spirals might help us grow up: if for some reason it's harder to do an "expand stroke" on a spiral compared to a bezier, making "skeleton-based" type design becomes less attractive.

What I meant applies to any type, in fact to any act of Design.
As opposed to Art. Users don't care about Terry, and they shouldn't.

> a consistent contrast scheme

Formal consistency is often dysfunctional when it comes to what humans need.

		<div class="commentbody">Raph, I'm having a hard time mentally linking an outline description format and any particular set of shapes made with it. This idea seems very tenuous and hopeful. What do you think it will lead to that is of interest to type designers? I can imagine all kinds of outcomes of interest to mathematicians.....  

"Users don’t care about Terry, and they shouldn’t."

These two statements might also be a matter of opinion. We do tend to admire people who make things we love to see/use, and I suspect Terry is one of those. Ignoring esthetics is foolish. It's a meaningful ingredient of any design effort.

Hrant, I fully agree that chirography, or fashion, or convention, or any other isolated factor is unhealthy to fixate on. But condemning them as causal of some sort of degradation, disintegration or arrest of progress seems also nearsighted. I'm interested in a balance of ideal function and esthetic appeal (physically as well as visually), and in all areas of design.  It is amusing sometimes to see a chair that looks painful and dangerous, which turns out to be rapturous to sit in, but you then have to trick people to sit in it the first time. And I don't see these ingredients/concerns as so opposed as you seem to. Yes, of course it's misleading to fixate on chirography, or "logic" or rules or ink traps, to the detriment of everything else. But I don't think Terry is at that point. We all converge in the type world from very different paths. Bitmaps for example. Or math.

Central to this thread is how to get tools (like Raph's) into our hands so we can stop noticing or being influenced by them, which relates to Terry's comment. Raph might actually like to know how people prefer to work. Whatever method or technique people start out with, you have to agree it's the results that matter.

Talk about a massive overstatement! You've missed the point entirely. This isn't about any individual person. It's about making a useful tool for people to use. Nothing more. There's no such thing as a fool-proof, universally accepted method. In fact— FontLab and Illustrator handle Beziers very differently and because of that "users" prefer different methods. Some type designers use Illustrator and import into FontLab—some use FontLab only, and some still even use Fontographer. So your statement is a complete oversimplification. I often find the critical flaw in many of your opinions is that they're based too much on the idea of "absolutism." Life is not all black and white.

Hrant, you're too smart of a guy to make outrageous statements like this. Your fixation on chirography is very apparent to most frequenters of Typophile I'm sure, so it's no surprise that you've twisted words to make your point. 

I find it amusing that this is the very thing I've seen you criticize William Berkson about time and time again— you're too literal. Try reading and understanding a person's intent before reacting. And if something is not stated clear enough for you...you can always ask a question. I would have been happy to explain myself more clearly. But I'm sure just reacting is a lot more fun.

It's about balance. When I seem too radical it's because the situation is desperately lopsided, and the balance needs a firm kick to right itself. Gentle, gradual cajoling will not work, at least not in one person's lifetime, and I'm not going to get my offspring to pursue my own ideals - I have to do it myself. When a person is hysterically out of control, you deliver a well-meaning slap in the face. (I don't mean you, I mean the field of type design.)

But I really don't want to derail this thread, which is why I didn't reply much more fully to Carl's post. But you went a hair too far, so I felt compelled to write the above, sorry.

On topic: I imagine that I could get used to using this drawing method, and the possibility of ignoring the eventual pixel grid is attractive. David Berlow raises an interesting question: How easy to cut and paste, how easy to grab and stretch large segments, how easy to interpolate? All figure into my production flow. I also don't like the idea that the outlines I draw carefully must necessarily go through a conversion process unless I am very very confident of the conversion algorithm, and I'm really picky in that area. PS outline drawing has the advantage that the exact shapes I draw are what the user will receive and use.</div>

Did you miss the French curve challenge on page 1 of this thread? It looks like the conversion algorithm (although apparently not too fast) produces very fine results, without causing an infestation of bezier nodes.

Here's something I did in ten minutes. It's not production-ready or anything, but I've been working with Beziers for at least twelve years, and I don't think I could do something that looks this good in ten minutes in FontForge, Inkscape, or any other Bezier program.

		<div class="commentbody">Raph, that tool is very exiting, I think it solves some major problems with Bezier curves. I have a few comments and questions:

1. As far as I can see, Spiro is essentially a tool that takes on-curve points as input and outputs Bezier curves. Could you explain the benefit of using spirals as an intermediate step? Wouldn't it be possible to find Bezier splines that run through the given points with G2 continuity? Doesn't the problem of G2 continuity still remain when two spirals are connected?

2. It seems that the main differences to direct Bezier editing are:
a. built-in G2 continuity, which is great but G2 continuity can also be enforced automatically for Bezier splines (as I have shown in Lisbon last year)
b. no off-curve points, which is great
c. no need to specify tangents for on-curve points, which is great
d. no possibility to specify tangents for on-curve points, which is very odd

I think for practical type design application it is very important to be able to specify tangents for your on-curve points, which Bezier splines allow but not Spiro. Would it be possible to add support for tangents? Then we would actually have the best of both worlds. Also, I think an option to specify tangents without the position of the on-curve points would be a very handy in everyday type design

3. What about rounding errors? The restriction to 1000 units seems to be built into T1/CFF, isn't also the use of integer coordinates a requirement of Postscript fonts? Or is this just an FL-internal restriction? If not, looking at the (un-rounded) Postscript output is irrelevant - we need to see the final shape in fonts with coordinates rounded to integer numbers and 1000 UPM.

4. You say that Multiple Master technology does not preserve G2 continuity. It is my experience, however (in hundreds of cases), that G2 continuity is in fact preserved when interpolating Bezier curves with MM. I don't know whether it could be proven that this is the case under certain conditions (or under which conditions, to be more exact).

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Tim: thanks for your kind words, and even better, your good questions. Some of these questions require fairly deep answers, to which I would refer you to my thesis (I'll put the draft-in-progress online in the next day or two). But I'll try to at least scratch the surface here.

<em>Could you explain the benefit of using spirals as an intermediate step?</em>

Yes. G2 continuity is not the only smoothness property you care about, it's just really crisp and easy to measure. You also want to make sure that the curvature doesn't have any sharp peaks in it. But there is no agreement on what is <em>the</em> best way to quantify this. In my thesis, I refer to Potter Stewart's (meta)-definition of <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/bruce/bruceindecentspeech.htm">obscenity</a>, and then go on to propose the L∞ norm of the deviation of curvature as the most favored measure of curve smoothness. To all those naysayers out there who feel it should be the L2 norm, I say: fie unto you.

If all you cared about was G2 continuity, Beziers do OK. Manning showed a G2 continuous cubic spline in 1973 (it was used, apparently, for shoe insole shapes). However, for very large turning angles between the on-curve points, his spline sometimes did not converge to a unique solution. Hobby's 1985 splne (used in Metafont, and thus how I got hooked on this stuff) was influenced by Manning's, but traded off exact G2 continuity (it uses a good approximation of curvature instead) for bulletproof stability of the solutions.

But neither of these curves <em>look</em> pretty if you try to make, say, an S segment that turns 90 degrees one way and then the other - you get curvature peaks at about 15% and 85% of the arc length.

So spirals deal with both problems: you never get a curvature peak except at the control point. Also, (and I'm still nailing this down), you can get very good stability. The specific divergence of Manning's spline is definitely avoided, but I don't know for sure whether the Euler spiral spline <em>always</em> converges, or just almost always.

<em>Wouldn’t it be possible to find Bezier splines that run through the given points with G2 continuity?</em>

Yes, Manning's is one such. But the results are quantifiably not as good. I'll have illustrations in my thesis, I promise.

<em>Doesn’t the problem of G2 continuity still remain when two spirals are connected?</em>

That's exactly what the goal of the spline solver is: find Euler spiral segments between all adjacent on-curve points so that curvature is continuous across them. Once you take that as the challenge, it's not <em>too</em> difficult to work out numerical techniques to take it on.

<em>Would it be possible to add support for tangents?</em>

Yes. In fact, I originally planned to do exactly that, but generally found that I didn't need it for my own work. If other people find they need it, it's doable. Inside the solver, the constraints are written as a big matrix, with parameters corresponding to tangent angle, curvature, and so on. It's a matter of UI plumbing to let people write more kinds of constraints, including tangents. I was very concerned about UI complexity, though.

<em>What about rounding errors? The restriction to 1000 units seems to be built into T1/CFF, isn’t also the use of integer coordinates a requirement of Postscript fonts?</em>

John spoke well to the 1000 unit issue. But the short answer is no, the div operator lets you do rational fractions, which means more or less unlimited accuracy. The only real downside is that the font file gets quite a bit bigger.

That said, I also expect good results with rounded coordinates, because it chooses the minimal number of Beziers, and therefore long segments. Rounding becomes more visually noticeable as Beziers get shorter. (This is deep water that I expect to cover more deeply in my "converting to Beziers" chapter - in order to make sense of it, you have to adopt a different error metric than "max distance error". I argue for L2 norm of angle error as an error metric that more accurately models the perception of curve smoothness)

<em>It is my experience, however (in hundreds of cases), that G2 continuity is in fact preserved when interpolating Bezier curves with MM. I don’t know whether it could be proven that this is the case under certain conditions (or under which conditions, to be more exact).</em>

In the <em>general</em> case, it doesn't even preserve G1. An example is given in Figure 2-8 of Adobe's <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/5091.Design_MM_Fonts.pdf">tech note 5091</a>. I can imagine that you learn quickly enough to stay away from those cases, but my point is that the onus is on the designer. With spirals, you do get the G2 continuity all the time, without having to worry about it.

I would imagine that G1 continuity is always preserved when the angles of the control arms are consistent between the masters. This is, of course, always the case at extremal points, which is probably the main reason why they're such a big deal.

It's when you get into more subtle variations, the kind that just can't be done with a single long Bezier segment, that it's harder to control the smoothness.

Here's another interpolation example I whipped out quickly:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/s_interp_6237.png]

As you can see, the curvatures of the fat S are quite different from those of the thin - the radius on the inside bowls is quite small. And all that was done with 17 on-curve and 4 corner points. I've also put up a <a href="http://levien.com/spiro/s_interp.pdf">PDF</a> for people who want a closer look.

It is very strongly recommended for Type 1 fonts, i.e. things are expected to break if you use a UPM other than 1000. But it is not a requirement for CFF fonts. I've made CFF fonts with UPMs of 2048 and 4096, and they work fine. There were largely aesthetic problems in pre-CS2 versions of Adobe apps, which presumed a UPM of 1000 for calculating caret height, but that's fixed now and I have not seen other problems with using UPMs other than 1000.

As for the PDF, it would be interesting to see the Spiro based interpolation next to an MM generated version. Do they differ much? If you want you can send me a font file and I can do that interpolation based on Bezier curves (with some preparatory MM optimimations). It looks like your interpolation also can't avoid the problem that in the interpolations the stroke at the center of the s is too thin (being inherited from the extra bold, where it is necessary). I assume this problem can't be solved on a contour basis.

Finally, I have to admit that I do not find the curve of the s in your PDF harmonic at all, especially the three lightest versions. Maybe it is just my subjective perception. To me the disharmonic shape becomes apparent only in the lowest line, where it is filled in. Maybe the initial reactions here in this thread would not have been that enthusiastic if people had seen their shapes filled in? Sorry, no offence, your stuff is great.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">sgh:<cite>Could you please explain more about how to enforce G2 continuity for Bezier splines?</cite>

It basically works like that: 

Nodes that connect two Bezier curve elements are shifted towards the wider curve until the curvature on both sides of the node is equal. During this, the BCPs of both cureves are adjusted so that the shape stays as close as possible to the original: for non-s-shaped curves the BCPs are adjusted so that the area within the curve stays the same (taking into account that thin triangle created by the shifting of the node). For s-shaped curves, the BCPs are adjusted so that the curve stays as close as possible to the original, meaning the curve is split in two and both areas within the "half curves" stay the same as before.

Alternatively, nodes that are not extrema can be rotated (towards the narrower side) until the curvature is equal on both sides. BCPs are adjusted as above. I feel this gives better results thatn shifting but it is obviously not possible for extremes.

In addition, I am experimenting with G3 continuity, which obviously means that nodes are shifted perpendicular to their tangent until G3 continuity is given.

Note that this is a system that <cite>processes existing shapes</cite> - it does not <cite>generate</cite> shapes. I think this approach is much more appropriate to the typical design process.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tim,

Thanks for the description.  I've seen the simpler technique of shifting the on-curve node between the fixed off-curve control points mentioned before.  In the construction of <a href="http://typophile.com/node/31970">Aurulent Sans</a> I actually have macros that automatically adjust curve nodes in this way to achieve continuous curvature (this is done after the basic shapes are constructed as a finishing touch).  MetaPost's Hobby splines are sometimes discontinuous in curvature when I specify more about the curve (such as tangents, etc).  I'll think about rotating points non-extreme curve nodes.  Is solving for the rotation to achieve continuous rotation numerically stable?

<cite>In addition, I am experimenting with G3 continuity, which obviously means that nodes are shifted perpendicular to their tangent until G3 continuity is given.</cite>

Assuming that "G3 continuity" means continuity of the derivative of the curvature, can this in general be obtained with cubic Bezier curves?

Like everybody now, I guess, I do this 'taking out the bumps' stuff by eye, rather than algorithm. 

I have usually found it easier to slide nodes (using the shift key in FontLab) than to change the angle of smoothly connected bezier handles. Changing the angles of handles seems to mess up the 'other' curve--the one you don't want to change--more than sliding the node. 

If you are free to move around the angle and length of one handle, because there is a sharp connection, and the other node is at an extremum. then it is easier. But then curve continuity across the node is also not an issue. 

Also, to sound a different note here, I think the issues of proportion, weight, contrast, and connections of all the parts of glyphs are more important to text faces than the exact curves, which are not so visible at text sizes. Though sweet curves are an important part of the story, they aren't the biggest part of the story. </div>

You're right, it kinda sucked. I was trying to do it with too few points, and too quickly. I spent a little more time on the example, doing a couple of printed rounds instead of entirely on screen, and I'm sure you'll agree that the results are more satisfactory. Sweet curves are, as William points out, no substitute for a careful eye and a willingness to refine the outlines until they're just right. But I do think sweet curves can help that process, and certainly make it more enjoyable.

The new PDF is <a href="http://levien.com/spiro/s_interp2.pdf">here</a>, and this time I've included the filled versions in the image:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/s_interp2_4551.png]

@sgh: <em>Assuming that “G3 continuity” means continuity of the derivative of the curvature, can this in general be obtained with cubic Bezier curves?</em>

You can bring the error (discontinuity) down as far as you like, by using more curves. The default in Spiro is actually G4 continuity, but I'm switching to G2 as the default because it's easier to control, and the extra continuity isn't really visible except under extreme scrutiny.

<em>MetaPost’s Hobby splines are sometimes discontinuous in curvature when I specify more about the curve (such as tangents, etc).</em>

Well, they're always discontinuous in curvature, just not by much. But yes, when using a two-parameter spline (such as Hobby's cubic primitive or an Euler spiral), specifying the tangent makes the curvature quite discontinuous.

It would be interesting to experiment with G2 continuity with tangent constraints using a four-parameter spline. My guess is that it's possible, but it might not be easy to control, i.e. if the tangent is significantly different than the one that would be assigned automatically, it might cause ripples in neighboring segments. But it's hard to know for sure until it's implemented. I'm not sure if I'll have the chance to do that any time soon. Time to grow new rocket scientists!

Integrating Spiro splines into MetaPost would make a huge amount of sense. The integration would have to be relicensed under the GPL, and of course somebody needs to do the work. But I think it would be excellent closure, because the Hobby splines are what started me down this path in the first place.

I was always looking for a good way to have description of outlines without off-curve points and Sketch mode in FLS is an example of this approach. In that case we decided to make curve math compatible with Ikarus outlines (while based on different math) and that was not a best approach. Other methods that we were checking provided much smoother results but were not point-compatible with .ik files.

Few words about our future approach to different editing methods: the biggest problem of current Fontlab tools is that all of them mix production with design. We plan to separate it and offer plugin architecture for editing content of glyphs.

		<div class="commentbody">@yuri: <em>What about Peter Karow’s approach to construction of outlines using spirals? Is rougly the same idea? (It is on page 86 in English edition of his book.)</em>

Only roughly. The spiral shown on page 87 isn't Karow's, it's from the Purdy-McIntosh system (I have a bunch of references if anybody's that interested). Basically, the results are good, but the way they have it set up it's very hard to edit: the user has to put in all the spiral parameters explicitly. In my approach, the computer solves a global system determining the spiral parameters, based on curvature continuity constraints at the on-curve points. Completely original to my approach is the "one-way" constraint, which gives you continuous curvature at straight-curve joins (and is more general - the "straight" section can have a slight bend to it, and it solves that too).

<em>We plan to separate it and offer plugin architecture for editing content of glyphs.
There will be only two minimal requirements: plugin must resterize (with smoothing of edges) and provide at least a conversion to and from Bezier outline.
</em>

A plugin is an entirely satisfactory approach all around. But let me understand more fully, by asking some questions:

* Will it be possible to write interactive editing plugins in Python and have them work cross-platform?

* To do the rasterizing, as you say, can my plugin generate a (crude) Bezier and hand it off to a FontLab-supplied API for the rest?

* I assume that the plug-in also gets some kind of API for marshalling and unmarshalling the plugin-specific format into the FontLab database file. Is this correct? For what I need, JSON would be ideal, but other choices would also work.

I agree that combining "design" and "production" has serious disadvantages. I have come to believe that the best approach is to generate high-fidelity "masters" using a design tool, ideally with parameterization, and then have a batch-mode converter to freeze those parameters, quantize to a specific Bezier grid (either cubic or quadratic, although at this point I only have optimized conversion to cubics done), and generate the font file.

I also agree that it's possible to do quite a bit better than the .ik file format. It was pretty good for its time, but there's lots that I know now that just doesn't fit into the .ik approach. (Incidentally, the Ikarus spline is one I look at carefully in my chapter comparing two-parameter splines, along with the Hobby (Metafont) spline, Minimum Energy Curves, and, of course, Euler spirals).

I haven't actually played with the Python capabilities in FL5 to see what's possible, only looked at the documentation. It might be possible to do a useful prototype.

@sgh: no, the 0.01 x3 build doesn't load a background image at all. Sorry. It's obviously not <em>that</em> difficult a feature to add, because I do have it in the gtk1 version, but I just haven't gotten around to it, and I'm not sure when I will have time to do so. I was kinda hoping others would pitch in on the coding, but that hasn't happened (yet) either.

@hrant: <em>narrower "S".</em> I know. But at some point we cross the line from "what the tool can do" to "how good is Raph at font design." I'm middling-good and hope to get better, but that's kind of off the main topic of this thread.

Ultimately, I think it will take a number of people spending time with the tool and learning how to get good results before we can definitely answer the former question. People spend months, if not years, learning how to draw top-notch Beziers. I strongly suspect that the learning curve is easier for spirals. The big unanswered question is whether the results are better once you've climbed it.</div>

That's why we plan to implement it. 

There are many possible ways to draw outline. I personally experimented with several types of splines, some "centerline" methods, Ikarus curves etc. Even in FLS you may find 5 different ways to build outline: 2 types of curved in "main" mode, Sketch mode (some type of spline, point-compatible with Ikarus outline), Primitives (which is "object" UI) and some strange method to use components as "blocks" to build outline with autojoin function (not really useful and never documented). 

Only "main" mode actually survived and is used to draw, all others are more or less "experimental".

Oh, there are few more: in standard FLS distributive you may find 3 "Python tools" which are good examples of how this spiral-based technology may be integrated even into FLS5. 

Two tools are Line and Curve (latter shows some rudimentary auto-curvature control) and third is called Drops. It creates random-size circles if no tablet is connected. With pressure-sensitive tablet size of the circles depend on pressure.

Actually it is very interesting challenge to integrate spiral-based editing tools into FLS using Python tool gateway :-)</div>

Yes, but if you remove the latter (never fully, but much more
than with that "S") you'll have a better view of the latter.

So my advice was practical: make the "S" narrower, and people
will generally get a better idea of how good the spirals are.

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>* Will it be possible to write interactive editing plugins in Python and have them work cross-platform?</cite>

It is possible even now. Spiro data may be stored in glyph dictionary (Python-accessible storage for arbitrary data). Python tool API allows to redefine mouse events and window paint function, but that is currently very limited.

In future implemenation plugin API (both for Python and for general coding) will be greatly extended.

<cite>
* To do the rasterizing, as you say, can my plugin generate a (crude) Bezier and hand it off to a FontLab-supplied API for the rest?</cite>

By rasterization I mean conversion to 8-bit grayscale bitmap. While conversion to Bezier is OK, it will be much faster if Spiro outline is converted to supersampled vector-only outline. Then it can be passed to system or Freetype rasterizer to get bitmap. 

What I mean is that in furure plugin architecture we will define minumal set of plugin functions that are required for it to be included into FLS as "layer editor". That will include on-screen outline rendering, conversion to Bezier outline, rasterization to grayscale bitmap, serialization (it should store data in its own format <strong>and</strong> Bezier format for compatibility reasons) and UI integration. This plugin architecture is currently in early stage of development, so many more details will emerge as we move forward.

<cite>* I assume that the plug-in also gets some kind of API for marshalling and unmarshalling the plugin-specific format into the FontLab database file. Is this correct? For what I need, JSON would be ideal, but other choices would also work.</cite>

Future database format will be very different to what we have now. It will allow to store glyph layers in any format that is required by any of plugins.

.ik format: I think that computer power available at the time was an issue when Ikarus was developed. It is actually based on very simple math, which has many limitations. That is the reason why in sketch mode of FLS we are using some approximation of Ikarus curves with splines. That gives much more flexibility to outline (it can be solved with any position of points) while keeps it very close to .ik shape.  </div>

If not, how far along is the port -- I might be able to get some interest in development on the project. The developers I know though would probably want to port everything C++ with the QT GUI framework, to make it fully cross-platform.

Developement version of Inkscape supports Spiro as well now. It's implemented as a live path effect (that is, there is always a final bezier path in an SVG file) and can be applied to any bezier path or be drawn with a pen or pencil tool. It will be available in final Inkscape 0.47 release (due this autumn probably).

It involves a lot of switching back and forth between Spiro and Bezier drawing modes. The knife tool behaves unpredictably and the alignment tools are disabled in Spiro mode. Since I build letters with a lot of cut-and-paste, that sort of behavior is a hindrance.

 I suppose I should write my own tutorial once I figure out exactly what I'm doing.</div>

There is one simple curve I can't represent very well using Spiros in Fontforge
I've tried using fontforge.spiroLeft and fontforge.spiroRight to enter and exit curve but it doesnt seem to draw a perfect circle. It seems more like logarithmic curve.

Is there a way of drawing this curve using Spiros? Thanks

		<div class="commentbody">@dimitre: No, there's no easy way to do this in Spiro. The underlying math can do it, no problem, but I deliberately simplified the UI so there wouldn't be huge numbers of point types representing the different constraints. Christoph Knoth at ATypI suggested adding one more point type, which would be an extremum point - it would function similar to the curve point, but force the tangent to be a multiple of 90 degrees.

One way you _can_ do it is to set points 1 and 2 to be corner points, and put an additional point on the arc, but that doesn't guarantee continuity.

@Hrant Spiro can represent exact circles. Beziers can't, so in the conversion to Bezier you get an approximation, but of course it can be a highly precise approximation.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is all very interesting, but not very new.

URW Ikarus, developed by Peter Karow, in 1973-74, used Hermite splines having the important property that all the control points lie on the outline itself.

You had a few more points on curve but the control was great.

But, today, designers prefer and have accepted the off-curve Bezier handles.

However, Ikarus plug-ins where very powerful.

For example, you could change "one" serif and have the program replace all the serifs throughout automatically.

Another plug-in would slant or "italicize" the glyphs and optically adjust the distortions based on the amount of angle, and so forth.

Very powerful plug-ins that made the type designers job simpler, saved time. But, in the end, the type designer had to fine-tune everything by eye.

Automation can only go so far.

It seems that everyone is looking for the "magic" tool. How can I draw an "S" really fast without too much difficulty.

How can I get the tool to create a font for me relatively quickly, so I can make and market more fonts quicker.

I'm sorry, but there are no shortcuts to good typography or good type design.

I'm sure the tools will continue to make improvements with time. That is the nature of technology.

But the ultimate tool is ones own knowledge, talent and craftsmanship that one brings to the table.

Everything else is just a tool to help us explore the possibilities. Just a tool.</div>

Yes there are. You just have to invent them and/or [know how to] use them.

		<div class="commentbody">@raph: <cite>Christoph Knoth at ATypI suggested adding one more point type, which would be an extremum point - it would function similar to the curve point, but force the tangent to be a multiple of 90 degrees.</cite>

This would be fantastic!  One of the difficulties I've had in using Spiro for type design is the lack of control over extrema.  This is particularly troublesome when converting an existing design into outlines or trying to match specified metrics.

There are essentially 4 types of Spiro points:
<ol>
<li>corner points -- where the slopes and curvatures of the incoming and outgoing splines are unconstrained
<li>G4 curve points -- continuous up to the fourth derivative
<li>G2 curve points -- continuous up to the second derivative
<li>constraint points -- used to connect a curved line to a straight one
</ol>

		<div class="commentbody">Raph,

I've been re-reading your thesis (wonderful, by the way!) to see how an extremum point would work.  Following the table on page 121, I think the following might work for a point of fixed tangency:

\theta_l=\theta_r=fixed constant
\kappa_l=\kappa_r
\kappa'_l=\kappa'_r

These four conditions balance the four degrees of freedom a general Spiro segment has.  Do these seem like the right conditions?  I think it should be pretty straightforward to extend your solver to include this type of point.

Best wishes,
Stephen

		<div class="commentbody">I discovered this thread when seeking information about one of the earliest computer-based type design tools.

It was mentioned in a standard type design textbook, so I'm sure many here have seen it. A single Archimedian spiral was seen as sufficiently general that it was the only tool the system offered, playing the same role as Bezier curves in today's digital type formats.</div>

If I had salvaged one of its 8" font disks I would have tried to see what sort of format its fonts were stored in. Oh, and if I could attach an 8" disk drive to my system, of course.

It Was 1989 ("my thoughts were short, my hair was long") and the bosses' son returned from the US of A with two "laser printers", one from HP and the other one from a small but determined firm called "Apple", sporting an actual <em>programming</em> language ("PostScript", I recall). Soon after that, we abandoned AM -- just like pretty much the rest of the typesetting world.</div>
