body: does anyone have examples of logos that have been modified at the development
  stage to hide the name of the organization so that it can be market researched/print
  tested without fear of leaking a&#41; a new name b&#41; an new design for a existing
  company? <BR>a collection of these might be interesting.

    alt="Final image"> <BR> <BR>Gist is basically the road transport distribution
    part of BOC&#40;a UK medical &amp; industrial gases business&#41;expanded to offer
    services to third parties. I believe they carry Marks &amp; Spencer grocery products
    for instance. <BR> <BR>What intrigued me was that neither the word GIST or the
    broad style of the image we saw was associated with any business at the time,
    so even if we knew what it was going to be called, it still wouldn&#39;t have
    meant anything to anybody. <BR> <BR>PS: I never knew that &#34;gist&#34; was the
    centre of the word &#34;logistics&#34; until five minutes ago! <BR> <BR>Some linkage:

    in the production of reflective badges for staff uniforms, from the finished artwork.

  body: Whoa - I&#39;ve never heard of this. Is it some new British thing? <BR> <BR>How
    do they equate results from this research for a logo design <BR>with no name,
    is the answer that blue is better and red didn&#39;t work for your <BR>company
    called &#39;Company A Inc.&#39;? <BR> <BR>Looks like Richard&#39;s client wasn&#39;t
    even testing type or colour on their market. Was the test only about a gradient?
    Was that research oriented or for printability? <BR> <BR>And finally why would
    any company do this? Sounds like a waste of money that could otherwise be spent
    on their product or service. Sounds like some clients don&#39;t trust our skill,
    <BR>or a matter of watching over our shoulders while we work, plain ol disrespect
    <BR>or is this the final answer that would hold all designers liable for our work.

  body: Well, the logo is only one element in a corporate design, so perhaps they
    just wanted to do some focus group testing of ads, without tipping their hand.

  body: 'In this case the first image was supplied to companies who were actually
    going to manufacture product with this new branding, in our case, reflective badges
    for high-visibility jackets. <BR> <BR>I can only imagine&#40;and hope, for the
    client&#39;s sake!&#41; that the design and evaluation process had already been
    carried out. <BR> <BR>This sort of thing is very useful in a production environment.
    It isn&#39;t usually as good as this when our client is the end user&#39;s garment
    supplier, and we get all the right information from the start. <BR> <BR>A more
    common situation goes something like this: <BR> <BR>A freight company somewhere
    in England. <BR>A decision is taken to obtain high-visibility jackets. <BR>The
    guy who normally places orders&#40;probably knows all there is to know about truck
    tyres&#41; rings his contact in an industrial supply company&#40;who happens to
    major in packing tape and warehouse supplies&#41;. <BR>Tapeman speaks to somebody
    in our sales department&#40;very keen, but can&#39;t always tell how many colours
    make up CMYK&#41; and asks for a quote for , say it was the GIST  image above,
    a two colour badge. <BR>If we&#39;re really lucky they&#39;ll fax us a photocopy
    of the logo as well. <BR> <BR>BTW the first image above was a scan of an old inkjet
    print I had hanging around, so there isn&#39;t much colour management going on
    here. <BR> <BR>'

  body: aa ok - I can see it now. <BR> <BR>for production tests yeah - but don&#39;t
    see why one would hide the corp name or not test it on the real one still save
    for the client being disorganized. <BR> <BR>for focus group as Nick mentioned
    - yeah if it was a ad..I get it now.
