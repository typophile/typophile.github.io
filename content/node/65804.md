  my graduate research at the Fourth International Conference on Design Principles
  and Practices in Chicago. I will be presenting a paper I wrote (co-authored by my
  supervisor, Professor Raymond Klein) titled <strong>[[http://g10.cgpublisher.com/proposals/139|In
  search of the font effect: the effect of con\uFB02ict upon reading and naming typefaces
  serially]]</strong>. This will be my \uFB01rst conference presentation.\r\n\r\nFor
  more information you may visit [[http://designprinciplesandpractices.com/Conference-2010/|the
  conference website]] where they have posted [[http://g10.cgpublisher.com/program-detail.html|a
  preliminary schedule]].\r\n\r\nThank you and happy new year."

  body: "Congratulations Christopher!\r\n\r\nThe talk that Papazian cited is certainly
    relevant to your research. Lewis & Walker built upon the Stroop effect by showing
    that word recognition is improved when font characteristics like heaviness match
    words that carry the semantic characteristic of heaviness (rhinos are heavy, while
    rats are light).\r\n\r\nLewis & Walker:  http://www.psych.lancs.ac.uk/people/uploads/PeterWalker20061116T111653.pdf\r\n\r\nCollaborators
    and I have built on Lewis & Walker\u2019s research by showing that other kinds
    of characteristics built into fonts also can improve word recognition when paired
    with words that carry that semantic characteristic. For example a font can range
    on formality from formal to informal. People are faster to recognize formal words
    in a formal font and informal words in an informal font.\r\n\r\nI have tentatively
    proposed this as the key difference between serif and sans serif typefaces.\r\n"

    a computer a dictionary, and have it pick a heavy typeface for heavy words, and
    an informal typeface for informal words.\r\n\r\nOh, of course. If one's goal is
    not to improve recognition and readability, but to slant someone's perception
    of a text, one could choose a typeface that best suits the words you wish to emphasize.\r\n\r\nOh,
    dear. I had hoped this research had the potential to be used for good instead

  body: "Bringhurst and many others have said that you need to read the text you are
    setting before selecting an appropriate type. My study confirmed this observation.
    The style of the font needs to match the style of the content for the best reading
    experience.\r\n\r\nThe finding also means that studies of legibility are not leading
    us towards one font to rule them all. Many fonts are necessary in order to match
    many kinds of content.\r\n\r\nJohn: <em>Can you tell whether that is due to positive
    reaction in the case of matched form and content or to negative reaction to mismatched
    form and content? </em>\r\n\r\nIn order to answer that question you would need
    words that are 1) consistent, 2) inconsistent, and 3) neutral with the font being
    presented. My study and Lewis & Walker only used consistent and inconsistent words.
    That would be an interesting next step.\r\n"

    Stroop effect: An integrative review. <em>Psychological Bulletin. 109(2)</em>
    163 \u2013 202. \r\n\r\nRegarding \"<em>Can you tell whether that is due to positive
    reaction in the case of matched form and content or to negative reaction to mismatched
    form and content?</em?>\"\r\n\r\nMacLeod (1991) describes what he calls a \"congruency
    effect.\" In this section he cites several studies, most of which were colour
    naming tasks. One conclusion was that time to name congruent stimuli was indeed
    faster than time to name incongruent stimuli. However the difference in time between
    neutral and congruent stimuli was less than the difference between neutral and
    incongruent stimuli. I do not have access to their data to attest to the statistical
    significance of their findings. Overall, an excellent read for anyone interested
    in anything Stroop."

  body: "Christopher, Macleod's congruency effect is certainly interesting, but I
    think we need to be careful in extrapolating from simple visual or property congruence
    (e.g. <strong>heavy</strong> vs. heavy; <strong>rhinoceros</strong> vs. <strong>squirrel</strong>)
    and more abstract, culturally engendered associations such as formal/informal.
    I'd want to see evidence that the same kind of congruency effect accounts for
    the latter and not a higher level aversion to incongruent form and content.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the reasons that I found the study that MS sponsored on \u2018personality\u2019
    in typefaces problematic is that most of the keywords used were ones that we've
    been trained to associate with certain styles of typography by their use in advertising.
    So typeface \u2018personality\u2019 seems to me a self-reinforcing construct:
    the more times people see Didot used in fashion magazines, the more likely they
    will be to associate Didot with \u2018elegance\u2019. And of course, if you are
    asking participants to select keywords from provided lists, rather than to explain
    the associations they make in their own words, one is filtering out a lot of potentially
    interesting variance. I'm the guy who'd be describing Didot as decadent :)\r\n\r\nI'm
    doubtful that congruence at this level of abstraction functions in quite the same
    way as simpler visual or property congruence. At the very least, the associations
    involved are more nuanced and variable."

  body: "I'm not sure that shows the dominance of reading.\r\nCertainly, if the question
    is put <strong>in text</strong> \"what typeface is this?\" the answer, in words,
    may well be what the text signifies. However, flash the subject \"Helvetica\"
    set in Times, and then ask him to choose which typeface it was from a selection
    of various \"a\"s in different typefaces. I suspect he would choose Times, not
    Helvetica. \"Read and identify,\" not \"read and name.\"\r\n\r\nHas anyone re-done
    the Stroop test in a similar fashion?\r\nThat would be, flash the word \"black\"
    in red, and then have the subject pick the colour from a palette of square swatches.\r\n\r\nBeyond
    a pointed rebus-concept headline, the idea that type may match the semantic meaning
    of text is banal. \r\nSelf-referentiality, in which text refers to its own appearance,
    is a parlour trick, an art gallery amusement, a game of <em>double entendre</em>,
    nothing more. Ceci n'est pas une pipe.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I do love the concrete
    poetry of type specimens."
