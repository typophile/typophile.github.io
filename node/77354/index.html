<p>The Watercooling PC or mod should allow for putting your own specific distilled water.</p>
<p>Once a type designer is contracted, they could be sent a Holy Rivers distilled water in the post for them to put in their Watercooling PC before they design the क/क lower and upper cases letters.</p>
<p>The altered font will have the Watercooling PC using Holy Rivers water e.g. River Ganges mentioned when it is released to the public.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m afraid a water-cooled PC is a red herring. You need to look into [[http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/POWER/potassium/potassium.htm|potassium cooling]]. The chemical symbol for potassium is, of course, K, and therefore would be of much more benefit in conferring sacred properties on your PC than holy water. Even better, you should try [[http://www.goucher.edu/x39600.xml|diode laser potassium cooling]], because this would get you much closer to absolute zero, which is of course holier. Then too, there is [[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/294/5545/1320.abstract|Bose-Einstein condensation]]of potassium atoms (K) by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_cooling|sympathetic cooling]]. Not only is one Bose-Einstein condensate, the Higgs boson, called the &ldquo;[[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2850/what-is-the-god-particle|God particle]],&rdquo; but sympathetic cooling is clearly better than the forced cooling practiced by unfriendly computer technologists. (And of course we all know who [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Nath_Bose|Bose]] was.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can understand that if you regard the water of the River Ganges as sacred, that having it in close proximity to the CPU of a computer employed in the task of designing a font for the Latin alphabet that has more positive spiritual characteristics is something you may view as fitting or beneficial.</p>
<p>It should be noted, though, that in general the expense of fitting a computer for water cooling is considerable; it is a minority of dedicated players of computer games who seek to overclock their CPUs far enough so that they require such an extreme measure to achieve adequate cooling in order to continue functioning.</p>
<p>I note that at least one participant in these forums, Hrant Papazian, was sympathetic enough to your goals to participate in a font design for you. In general, as I&rsquo;m sure you have noticed, there is considerable skepticism concerning the merits of your project.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly possible that some type designer here is also a fanatic gamer, with an overclocked rig, but I do think that the odds are slim.</p>

<p>It makes perfect sense that a deity would be impressed by custom fonts and creative PC case mods. But you&rsquo;d better be sure its least favorite letter is K. You don&rsquo;t want to get that wrong and find out later that K is its favorite letter. That would be awkward. You want to be really sure about which letter it hates before you get too far into such a project.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is true that when the sun evaporates the water of the oceans, or of rivers, it becomes rain, which then forms the water of other rivers, sacred and secular. Whether that would have an effect on the sacredness of distilled water the provenance of which is known, however, would be for a Brahmin, not a meteorologist, to decide.</p>
<p>It may also be noted that there is nothing wrong with the phoneme /k/. The original poster is complaining about the shape of the glyph used to express it in the Roman alphabet. Neither in Tibet, nor in Nepal, nor in India, is the Roman alphabet what people use to write.</p>
<p>Now, I will admit that Kali isn&rsquo;t a very nice goddess, but if that does not stop the Hindus from venerating the Ganges, that is not an argument either.</p>

<p>Are you going to advertise your font as having been made with a computer cooled by unholy water? You&rsquo;d better since there&rsquo;s no such thing as distilled holy water. I mean think about it . . . how could steam be holy? It makes no sense whatsoever.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ray, note that for Hindus water from the Ganges is sacred on account of it coming from the holy river, not because it has been ritually sacramentalised as in the case of Catholic and Orthodox Christian holy water. You should not extrapolate from the evaporative de-sacramentalisation of the latter: it seems to me one would need to consult a Hindi priest in order to determine whether steam produced from Ganges water retains its sacred quality.</p>
<p>But thank you, because I&rsquo;ve been looking for an opportunity to use the phrase &lsquo;evaporative de-sacramentalisation&rsquo; in everyday conversation for many years now.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Evaporative de-sacramentalisation rolls off the tongue quite nicely, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t decided if javascript is trolling us or not. Even considering the convoluted letter substitution plan, it seems far too absurd to ask about a holy water cooled computer. Probably, if javascript really wanted the holy water to somehow affect the holiness of the exported fonts, why would it be required as a coolant. Although, I don&rsquo;t know for sure, I doubt that any religion requires or even recommends using holy water as a coolant for machines. Why wouldn&rsquo;t someone simply place a bottle of holy water inside the computer case? I think the first post in this thread was designed for comedy effect and nothing more. Because as absurd as his previous threads were, the very idea using holy water as a electronic device coolant is just too conveniently bizarre. While religion in general is chock full of cuckoo cuckoo, this request is akin to asking if anyone has made fonts using a computer that dispenses Eucharist wafers. Would you even doubt that such a thread is a troll?</p>
<p>Yes, I followed his previous thread and I thought there was a 30% chance he was the real deal. I believe there&rsquo;s a 90% chance this guy is yanking our collective wire.</p>
<p>On the 10% chance that javascript is actually serious about this: even if it turns out that converting to steam renders the water useless, perhaps almost boiling &amp; reverse osmosis filtering could make the water clean enough to run through a filter.</p>
