  for a graphic movie.  Shapes of this logo are similar to the illustrative style
  of the film. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11730.gif"

    the two variations and show them here: one with &#34;roundings&#34; only, and
    the other one with Z &amp; E:s kind of &#34;straightness&#34; at the whole logo.
    <BR> <BR>All in all it all depends on the overall concept of the movie as you
    mentioned. <BR> <BR>&#40;maybe show some snapshots <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: hmm, a little confused by the &#39;roundings&#39; you both are referring to.  I&#39;m
    assuming you are meaning, why are those corner points of the z and e more of a
    broad round angle? <BR> <BR>If that is what you mean, on earlier iterations I
    did that and the Z looked like a 2.  So I wanted to accentuate the angle a bit
    more for that to stand out.  Plus I think it adds a little bit more character.
    <BR> <BR>thanks, perhaps I will revisit....

  body: okay...I rounded out those joints.  I had to decrease the width of the whole
    thing so that it would adjust for the curves. <BR> <BR>which one do you think?
    <BR> <BR>I think rounding it out was a good idea, jacques <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    it will win in legibility and make the word more strong in the start of it. <BR>

    f and u &#40;increase the weight of them&#41;.

    increasing the weight of the one of the letterforms throw off the harmony overall?   <BR>

  body: 'Peter, <BR> <BR>I think what he&#39;s getting at is this: <BR>It looks like
    you&#39;ve made this by drawing a line in  <BR>illustrator, then adding weight
    to it &#40;with rounded corners,  <BR>and ends&#41;. This means that all parts
    of the characters are  <BR>the same width. However optically, verticals look skinny  <BR>compared
    to horizontals of exactly the same size. So you  <BR>have two options, 1&#41;
    make all the horizontals fatter or 2&#41;  <BR>make the verticals skinnier. JFP&#39;s
    suggestion is a good one,  <BR>fix the verticals because there&#39;s only three
    of them, the f  <BR>and the left and right parts of the u. <BR> <BR>You can go
    crazy here, because in reality optical  <BR>adjustments arent just for horizontals
    and verticals. What  <BR>about diagonals? Think of a circle. Thinnest at top,
    thicker,  <BR>thicker thicker thicker Thickest at the middle and thinner  <BR>again
    on the bottom. So diagonals should also fall  <BR>somewhere in between. Hope that
    made some sense. It  <BR>won&#39;t need much to make it look optically right.  <BR>Just
    a pinch. <BR> <BR>Randy'

  body: 'Randy, <BR> <BR>thanks to help me on my comment! <BR> <BR>To learn what value
    optically you need to adjust between horizontal and vertical: <BR> <BR>Draw a
    rectangle, multiply it by 2, one horizontal, one vertical, then adjust the one
    you want to achieve booth in same &#34;color.&#34; Then, you will know what kind
    of value you can start to do such corrections in your future jobs. <BR> <BR>I
    really don&#39;t think that the &#34;using size&#34; change something, its more
    how you see it, nobody see it in same way. In my case, I found 80% of serif typefaces
    have too thinner vertical in N and  V, etc.!!!!'

    <BR> <BR> Maybe the &#34;end&#34; of the lines could be straightened or &#34;polyfaced&#34;
    to take away the &#34;done in illustrator&#34; kind of feeling. <BR> <BR> Also,
    just as a variation, or possible solution, increese the angle of some of the corners,
    this will perhaps go together with &#34;Z/2&#34; and &#34;E&#34;:s straightfulness.

    &#34;theoretical&#34; guesswork &#40;as opposed to something gleaned from practice,

    landmark &#34;Manuel Typographique&#34;, a note at the beginning of chapter XIX
    &#40;&#34;Alignment&#34;&#41; says: <BR> <BR>&#34; <BR>To satisfy the eye at 6-pt.
    o has to be about one-eighth taller than the x, a 12-pt. one-twelfth, a 36-pt.
    one-fifteenth, and a 72-pt. one-eighteenth. The amount of difference required
    varies with the degree of extension of the type and the shape of the shading&#42;.
    <BR>&#34; <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW, &#34;shading&#34; here means stroke stress, I think.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>It sure is great to have the old guys confirm your hunches! <BR> <BR>hhp
