body: Okay, this isn't a font development question, but does anyone know how to get
  rid of the outlook contact and calendar folders that keep creating themselves on
  my desktop? Running Win XP SP2 with Outlook 2007. Any help is appreciated, this
  is bugging the heck out of me.

    altogether! I can't be of any help to you since I use a Mac but I feel your pain.
    Outlook is the only piece of crap we have that still requires Classic to run and
    it crashes constantly.\r\n\r\nSorry for my selfish rant. I just cringe when the
    word \"Outlook\" is mentioned.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    talks to the Exchange server just fine with the caveat that it is very difficult
    to get it to see the Global Address book.\r\n\r\nIt is 1000% more elegant than
    Outlook and it runs in OSX.\r\n\r\npeace"

    asking them to for years. They keep giving us that old lame security reasons bull

    can take their \"security: to hell with them!\r\n\r\nSorry Paul, it is a sore

    the same old excuse I used to get until I just became too unbearable.\r\n\r\nRunning
