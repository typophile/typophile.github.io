body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm completing my research regarding corporate typography -
  especially custom creations http://typophile.com/node/27315 - and I was amazed that
  the same fonts come up all the time as branding tools.\r\n\r\nYou know them - Helvetica,
  Univers, Frutiger, Futura, Myriad and the classic gothics (Trade, News, Franklin,
  ...) - used in close to half the cases.\r\n\r\nI asked a few graphic designers who
  work in branding why these same choices for very different companies and markets.
  Here are the main reasons: \u201CI don't know where to learn about new fonts\u201D
  and \u201CI don't have the time or the care to browse around the internet.\u201D\r\n\r\nMy
  suggestion is that a newsletter - an email one that is - be created to advertise
  these new fonts. People could subscribe for free and font distributors would only
  pay a few dollars to show these new fonts. Simple technology, a name, a visual,
  a price and a where to buy. Better yet if it could be multilingual.\r\n\r\nWhat's
  your opinion on this?"

    If we could get an edition of those newsletters to specifically be about faces
    that are corp id-friendly, now that's different."

    type consultants of some sorts? A lot of designers talk about type selection,
    house style guides and the likes -- all the time. Then there's the problem of
    unifying it across the border (print, web, TV, outdoor, etc.), while deciding
    on a face that would fit \"just right\" without resorting to the safe alternatives
    is already hard enough for them.\r\n\r\nTypographic consultancy that extends beyond
    simply distributing web newsletters, I think that has some potential. Think Fontsmith,
    but without the foundry."

  body: "I think a newsletter of this sort would be difficult to put together, because
    it really has to be independent. But even the MyFonts.com newsletters, which try
    to represent the broadest possible sources, are edited selections of new fonts\u2014not
    all new fonts are featured, and sales rank seems to have a lot to do with choice.
    Although Laurence does write great copy for it.\r\n\r\nTypeface selection, even
    for branding and corporate identity, is still a very subjective matter. How does
    one make an objective newsletter about it that treats all interested parties fairly?
    Who writes it, and what is the source that it comes from? A \"Typophile Newsletter\"
    would be brilliant, because this site has credibility."

    displays new fonts from a wide variety of foundries. I cannot even remember how
    I found typophile.com, but am glad I did. I have learned so much from all of you,
    and have found new favorites that I am saving up to buy (some of Stefan's beautiful
    creations). While I do love Univers and those other standards, it is wonderful
    to see how other typographers are interpreting letterforms.

    of these very issues.\r\n\r\nWhat if one could go to a web site that had a database
    of fonts and view the data in a variety of ways including RSS feeds *and* email
    newsletters. For example, one could register on the site and specify what categories
    of fonts were of interest, then receive a daily or weekly email listing new releases
    in just those categories. The listings would include a link back to the site for
    more information (such as ratings/reviews) and a link directly to the foundry
    or other appropriate vendor for purchase.\r\n\r\nThe real trick would be populating
    such a database and making the effort to include as many foundries/designers as
    possible.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on this approach?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\ntim"
