  (bolded by word) with 95% characters proportion and it's the most similar font but,
  as you can see by the comparison, it's not perfect. In particular:\r\n- the final
  part of e doesn't follow the rest of the elliptical shape but it poits outside\r\n-
  the \"cut\" of t is perfectly divided in 2 instead of being longer on the right
  side\r\n- the inside \"rings\" (empty parts) of o, a, p are too large\r\n- too much
  space between the \"legs\" of n\r\n- l is too short\r\nThe only good side is that
  the \"peaks\" of M can be easily cutted off to get the flat shape as the logo.\r\nThank
  you in advance :D\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/metro_4810.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/metro-futura_6365.JPG]"

  body: "You should try to use NOT an artificially emboldened but a real heavy version
    of Futura e.g. <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Adobe&ffam=Futura-Heavy%20-%20Heavy%20Bold&fid=2312dfe04a98e87ddb08725a6d6d565a&fsize=60&text=Metropolitana&fit=1|Futura
    Heavy]]</strong> from Adobe\r\n\r\nWhen a designer creates a bold/heavy/italic
    version of a font he actually redesigns the shape of letters to balance many visual
    aspects. \r\nAutomated bold/italic operations produces a different result and
    are usually aesthetically inferior to a real bold/italic font."

  body: "Thank you very much for your reply.\r\n\r\nI tried with Futura Heavy and
    this is the result\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/metro-FuturaHeavyORIG_3435.JPG]\r\nThen
    I modded some parameters to get a better result: size of M larger, 98% characters
    proportion. That's the result:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/metro-FuturaHeavyMOD_4607.JPG]\r\nM
    shape is more different then the original one and the previous case of Futura-Normal
    and there're still the same problems with t, n, l; I guess only e got better.\r\n\r\nAs
    you can see the result is not still perfect and I worder what font they used to
    print it.\r\nI also tried with futura koyu, FuturaBQ-DemiBold, Futura ICG Demi
    and there's always something wrong.\r\nCan you help me more or you think it's
    impossible to obtain \"the\" perfect result? Maybe a mix of futura font styles
    could be a better solution?\r\n\r\nThank you again."

  body: "There are too many variables here to give a perfect answer.\r\n\r\n1. The
    principle unknown is how Word emboldens a font. This could account for the /M
    width differences.\r\n\r\n2. There are perhaps hundreds of Futura fonts - ones
    with equal bars on the /t and some with unequal, some with shorter or longer /l,
    with wider or narrower /M or with shorter or taller /t, etc.\r\n\r\n3. The example
    shows a changing horizontal discrepancy (letter spacing) which could be attributable
    to kerning.\r\n\r\nYou may have to simply hand set and modify the letters to get
    what you're after.\r\n"
