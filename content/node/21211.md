  back I had to catalog a bunch of type catalogs that were piling up. It got me thinking
  about showcasing them instead of allowing them sit quietly in the dark - as if they
  had been punished and banished to the corner of the room. What better way than to
  build them into a piece of furniture - something I would use and view everyday.\r\n\r\nAfter
  tinkering with the design, the project was put into gear. While these photos don't
  show the completed piece, you can get the idea; The left half is reserved for monitor/keyboard/wacom,
  and the right half is the \"production\" area (which is cool because x-actos can
  not scratch the 1/4\" glass top, yet it cuts like a dream). The supports in the
  middle now hold the computer tower.\r\n\r\nNow the fun part - try and figure out
  where the type came from...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile1.notlong.com\">Top
