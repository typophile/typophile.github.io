  to identify the fonts used in it. \r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me what type is used for
  \"Main Dishes\" , \"Chapter 5\" and the sans serif used in the paragraph just below
  the \"main dishes\" illustration?\r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/betterhomes_4991.jpg]"

  body: "I wouldn't have said Gill - the 'M' is not right. It looks like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.108133.0.5&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Magic+white&sampleSize=48\"
    target=\"_blank\">Trade Gothic</a> to me.\r\n\r\nAlso, since this is probably
    pre-digital, Adobe Bodoni is out, but I agree that it is some sort of Bodoni.\r\n\r\nModerators,
    this should probably be moved to the Type ID Board.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Pre-digital? I thought this was retro?\r\n\r\nTrade Gothic is a good guess,
    I based my Gill Sans on the a of the word \u201Cand\u201D. I thought I saw a tail.\r\n\r\nWell,
    Jay-O, what do you say?"

  body: "All of the headline type is probably drawn by hand, photographed and composited
    by hand, if this is before the 1960 or so. One that comes close to it is Craw
    Modern, perfect for that \"Good Housekeeping, 1954\" feel: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/craw-modern/

  body: I would agree that "Main Dishes" and the other serif type is Bodoni (metal,
    probably the ATF version), not hand lettering. I also concur that the sans is
    Trade Gothic (or possibly News Gothic). My mom had this cookbook, so these pages
    look very familiar to me. The illustrations and photos are not stock. Imagine
    that. :-)

  body: Right. Although "Bodoni" was a popular hand-lettering style of the 1950s (often
    "bounced"), this is pretty strict, and was probably hand-set from metal type.
    Most typesetters had Bodoni in large sizes, often in cuts from both Bauer and
    ATF. However, it may also have been produced from photo-process lettering (phototypositor).
    I notice an fl ligature there -- would that be any help in identifying the source
    of the type?
