  reason I'm posting is to ask if anyone can help me work out what this typeface is.
  I saw it at www.threadless.com and really love it. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/my_mystery_font_3699.gif]\r\n\r\nIf
  I can't find out what is is, could anyone recommend something similar?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\n"
