  body: "Faeroese (f\xF8royskt) uses \xE6 but not \u0153. It uses \xF8 instead, like
    Danish and Norwegian.\r\n\r\nFrench uses \u0153, but \xE6 is supposedly restricted
    to rare words of Greek or Latin origin and I don't recall seeing it used in the
    wild (I live in France).\r\n\r\nThe language that uses both \xE6 and \u0153 that
    you're looking for is of course traditional (19th century) English, with spellings
    like 'am\u0153b\xE6'. This kind of spelling does persist with some rare words
    today, especially in British English, though I get the feeling that nowadays its
    use is mostly about \xE6sthetic appeal and is likely to be the result of a man\u0153uvre
    to give a medi\xE6val touch to your \u0153uvre."

    and I was checking out an issue of Qu\xE6rendo. Nobody had checked it out before,
    so the lady needed to make a label for the inside back cover. Except she couldn't
    find it in the system. She kept typing Quoerendo. Check out the cover:\r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/c3rekv2\r\n\r\nDon't
