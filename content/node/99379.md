    way more deadly, what after being used as a bathroom (*), washing machine, and
    drinking water of about 200 million people, before coming out in the Bay of Bengal.
    At that point even an atheist would walk on it --  drowning may not be an option
    (although sufficating would, with a tip of the hat to Terry Pratchett).\r\n\r\n(*)
    Those holy man, do they come out of the river to go to the bathroom, or do they
    let the water \"flush all their sins away\"?"

    the \"philosophical\" reasons for this proposed change are inherently devoid of
    merit to anyone who isn't a Hindu; how much relevance they may have to most members
    of that faith is a question I am not competent to judge.\r\n\r\nIt's true that
    English with the unmodified Latin alphabet is widely used in India, and the OP's
    suggestion does not seem to have caught on there - but advocating something like
    this, however eccentric it may seem, at least has an intelligible basis in that
    context.\r\n\r\nBut what I would note is that many if not most commercial fonts
    have licensing restrictions that prohibit modifying them, even for your own use.
    Thus this could be an unwise move."

    an AI system written in Lisp running on a forgotten Symbolics somewhere in Montana
    that's behind it all.
