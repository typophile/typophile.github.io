  body: Yeah, best of luck! Wish I could be there, but I doubt it will happen this
    year. Maybe FontConf II though... :)

    just to make sure I have it right - OpenType is that font format thingy, right?
    ;)\r\n\r\n@rob\r\n\r\nspread the word, please. It will be a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nRich"

  body: "@ Garrick: Great idea for a conference. One thing I noticed today; on your
    site where you register it says \"Free\" however I was unclear if this meant free
    as in no conference fees, or free as in there are still free spaces left (the
    column with the word \"Free\" has no heading).\r\n\r\nI went through the registration
    process expecting to see a \"final complete step by paying\" of sorts in order
    to confirm for myself if there was indeed a cost, but discovered instead that
    I had just registered as an attendee.\r\n\r\nThe leads me to believe it is free,
    yet I was also informed that I would be emailed tickets. I post this here instead
    of an email to help others avoid potential confusion. As it stands, the list says
    I am attending when I cannot. I think a simple solution would be to simply put
    a \"Conference fee\" heading over the word free. This is a valuable piece of information,
    especially for poor students who can contribute content.\r\n\r\nI look forward
    to the outcome of your conference. This is a very interesting time for type."
