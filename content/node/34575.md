body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nHelp me on this it's rather urgent. I need to ID this typeface,
  the \"a\" are very FF signa / Storm Elektra / FF Dax. The myfont's \"More font's
  like this\" is very peculiar on the recent days, it suggests Comic sans on 4th place
  for FF signa. I guess it's a random thing :) :S\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAdriano[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_5755.jpg]"

    ID Guide</a>? You only need a, e, g, G, M, R and y. You have only posted the a
    and e, so that doesn't give me much, although I am looking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Looking at the two fonts shown at MyFonts, they show Veto as designed in
    1999, and it includes more variations for other languages, as well as OpenType,
    as an option. Seems like Marco is an enterprising designer. More power to him.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "At least with Sari, a few letters were changed by Reichel to go with the
    name change (the M and R, I think). It's not obvious to me that there are any
    differences between Evo and Veto, other than adding a Euro, OpenType features
    and supporting more languages.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
