  in all names, even it looks like Din, dunno what it is. The small caps \"may\" be
  a different font, but... I think they may be same.\r\n\r\nDont pay attention to
  the photocopy effect glitch... it was made over the original font\r\n\r\nthanks!!

  body: 'Can''t find a match, may be it''s one of amc corporate typefaces and exclusive
    for ''[[http://www.amctv.com/shows/the-killing|The Killing]]''. To me, first names
    and last names are 2 different fonts. The one for the first names is some Helvetica-like,
    possibly Arial, mainly because of the angled cut /t ascender top terminal. For
    the last names, as you said, it''s some sort of DIN but found nothing that could
    perfectly match all these letters at the same time: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/conduit|Conduit
    ITC]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/din-next|DIN Next LT]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-din-text-pro|DIN
    Text PF]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/betatype/pill-gothic|Pill Gothic]],
    <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/uni-sans|Uni Sans]]</strong>
    (possibly the closest)'

    body: "Thanks!  Yes... the Uni Sans is very close, specially in the S, D, G.  Im
      not sure bcs the inside angle of the N... and the one that breaks a lot is the
      C... its not so round.\r\n\r\nIt looks nice to mix the Arial kind w/ the \"Uni\"\r\n\r\nthanks
      again for your help! :)"
