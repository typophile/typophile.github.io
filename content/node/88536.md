body: "Hello,\r\nI'd be grateful for help with the proper presentation of the attached
  address line.\r\n\r\nThe city is set in upper and lower case and postal code is
  in text figures; should the province abbreviation be set in full caps or in small
  caps, same as the postal code?\r\n\r\nAnd would the correct spacing be an en space
  between each or only between ON and the postal code?\r\n\r\n...With apologies for
  such mundane questions.\r\n\r\n(Re-posting this here as it was probably a mistake
  to post it in the design forum).\r\n"

  body: "Thanks so much for the responses.\r\n\r\nI did consult Bringhurst but was
    unable to determine how to handle this precise combination. With the ON abbreviation
    set in small caps it just looked like a continuation of the postal code. The addition
    of an extra space before the postal code seems to help though, so thanks again.\r\n"

  body: "There's a difference between setting type for reading by humans and for processing
    by the machines of the postal service. The U.S. Postal Service prefers all caps
    and no punctuation, among other things:\r\n\r\nhttp://pe.usps.com/businessmail101/addressing/deliveryaddress.htm\r\n\r\nThey
    like two spaces between the state (province) and zip (post) code, too."

  body: I think abbreviations of only two capital letters should always be full caps,
    with the exception of academic degrees.
