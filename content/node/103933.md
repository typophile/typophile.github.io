  any of you are fans of Mad Men (the show about ad agencies in the late 1960s), you
  might enjoy this analysis of the logo for the new agency formed by the merger, Sterling
  Cooper & Partners. It includes a copy of Peggy Olson's press release.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/and_partners_make_seven.php\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mad_men_1_6372.jpg]"

    perhaps that \uFB01ts the agency.\r\nNot a <em>Mad Men</em> watcher, so I wouldn\u2019t
    know.\r\n\r\nWhile none of the type is anachronistic in the sense of being designed
    after the supposed date, the Eurostile is a bit pass\xE9. The Ogilvy & Mather-ish
    ampersand is an afterthought, at odds with the reductive quality of the Futura
    Black/Albers stencil style. Sure, stencils are hip now, but did the designer think
    that people wouldn't get the 60s thing without the ampersand and the still-techy
    Eurostile? \r\n\r\nFrom 1968:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PapasMamas_6663.jpg]"
