  such as Glama Natural and Neenah UV may do the trick, but he would like a <i>clear</i>
  business card--like acetate. Can anyone offer any advice concerning this? Is silkscreening
  an option? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison

    this type of thing.'

    a message your post is posted. To check just go back one page and scroll up to
    topics, you will see your name listed as the last post in your forum. <BR> <BR>Addison,
    I would think silk screening would be the way to go but, what I would do first
    is contact a print broker. A print broker usually has a small plant but is wired
    into other printers who have different kinds of presses like letter press and
    of course silk screen.

  body: Thanks, Mike and Daniel. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not familiar with print brokers--not
    sure there&#39;s one in Mississippi. I know of a silkscreen shop to contact, but
    just in case--can you suggest an out of state print broker? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison

  body: I would be very careful of working with print brokers. Most are highly protective
    of their information and contacts. If you personally want to press check it, for
    example, most print brokers will not allow this. &#40;Boy I sound negative&#41;

  body: Thanks for the heads-up, Tiffany. It&#39;s not negative--it&#39;s ummm, professional
    awareness. There are a few printers here that find press checks insulting.

    runs a hot stamping and plastic fab company. You can reach <a href="http://www.urunlimited.com/"

    <BR>My dad helped him build a huge laser for his business and we hire them to
    hot-stamp our plastic injection-molded pickup covers.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve mentioned
    in another thread the usefulness of nameplate makers for these unusual requests.
    These are the guys that regularly diecut and print on plastics, and they are pros.
    I think there&#39;s a danger of a clear business card looking hoaky if it isn&#39;t
    done very well. '

  body: Tiffany, sorry you&#39;ve had bad experiences with print brokers. I&#39;ve
    had nothing but good experiences with them and I&#39;ve never been denied access
    to a press check. The idea of working with a print broker is to build a relationship
    and with the relationship - Trust. <BR> <BR>Addison, have you tried looking on
    the internet for speciality printing?

  body: Adriano, that&#39;s the look we&#39;re going for. But actually, the image
    on the computer in the background shows a totally transparent card--looks like
    from a yayhooray messsageboard. <BR> <BR>Mica, thanks for the info--I may look
    them up. Anything unique like that would be great. <BR> <BR>Daniel, no, I haven&#39;t
    done much looking yet, but I&#39;ve got to do that. You all have already helped
    a lot. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison

  body: Daniel, that is great. I wish I could find one that I could trust. I&#39;ve
    just found that I would prefer to be there myself and hear the excuses and reasons
    firsthand. <BR> <BR>For instance, before the press I frequent started doing film
    in-house I&#39;d output the film myself. The press would often blame the film
    for being out of register by a dot or so. I would find ways to output/design the
    job so the film could be smaller. Now, however, they output the film for me and
    I can simply tease them about their film. I have a wonderful long-standing relationship
    with the press and feel as if I&#39;ve learned more from getting dirty at the
    press &#40;so to speak&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also dealt with some brokers that
    told me how much they mark up the job and found that to be too much. So I act
    as the broker for my own design clients keeping the price lower.

  body: 'Tiffany, I often work in consort with a print broker bidding on a job. They
    know there will be at least 3 bids on a print job. By working closely with me
    they can even give me ideas that will make the job look great but also save my
    client money. They don&#39;t want to piss me off I make them money too! <BR> <BR>Sorry
    for diverting the subject from Allisons need. In Photoshop users magazine there
    are lots of short run digital printers throughout the US. My guess is they are
    in places with cheap facilities &#40;Rent&#41;. You might check out one of these
    sites, but, you probably won&#39;t end up doing a press check in a traditional
    way. They might post a proof online. One site you might check on is CreativePro. '
