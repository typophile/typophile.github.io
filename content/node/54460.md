body: "I've found a couple of versions in my collection, one labelled 'Times new Roman\"
  and another with separate weights that is labelled \"Times NR MT\" that looks a
  bit different. One seems a bit more narrow than the other. And the relative sizes
  are different as well. 12 point Times New Roman isn't the same as 12 point Times
  NR MT.\r\n\r\nIs there a definitive version or a version that a collector *should*
  have? I know there are several versions and that there has been quite a bit of licensing
  going on. I'm no longer sure which is which.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any advice. \r\n\r\nCheers. "

    blessings is really the point, the original metal version did have a feature that
    no digital one yet has, and without which one could say it's not the same font
    at all: optical scaling.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
