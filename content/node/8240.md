  body: They&#39;re all part of the Bickham&#39;s <a href="http://www.transaction-one.com/gs/html/a/adobe/fontstore/en/type/browser/pdfs/BICQ/BickhamScriptStd-Regular.pdf"
    target="_blank">alternate</a> characters, which were part of the Bickham Script
    standard opentype font. Now Adobe has shipped <a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/bickham.html"
    target="_blank">Bickham Script Pro</a>, which features perhaps the most alternate
    characters ever featured in the same font and takes full advantage of the opentype
    format. I hope this helps.
