  getting a <a href=\"http://www.iloanshop.com/\">mortgage refinance loan</a> can
  save you money and  help you gain control over your finances, it isn't always easy.
  You could be taken advantage of overcharged,  or you could even end up taking a
  loan that isn't in your best interest. Loan officers often get a bad reputation
  of  ripping people off, but remember, there are a lot of good, moral, loan officers
  \ out there that are really interested in helping people. To get the best loan for
  yourself, you must  be an informed borrower. Here are some  valuable <a href=\"http://www.iloanshop.com/\">mortgage
  refinancing</a> tips that you should consider before <a href=\"http://www.iloanshop.com/\">Refinancing

  refinancing loan</a> tip is that you should always interview your loan officer.
  This person will be handling your  finances. You should at least like them. Many
  people make the mistake of only asking about rates. Instead, you should ask about
  their experience and see how they feel about the market. Ask them for some <a href=\"http://www.sunrefinance.com/\">Mortgage
  \ Refinance</a> and see how they react. Are they  friendly and helpful? Do they
  sound irritated? Go with your instincts to find a loan officer that suits you best.\r\n\r\n<a

  you. You  may be persuaded to go with a loan that isn't in your best interest, so
  it's your responsibility to figure out what is best for you. One way to do that
  is to compare the benefits of the loan with the total cost of the loan. For example,
  benefits of a <a href=\"http://www.refinancing101.net/\">mortgage  refinancing</a>
  \ loan could be monthly savings and lower  interest rate, while the cost could be
  high fees. Ask your self if the <a href=\"http://www.refinancing101.net/\">Refinance
  Loan</a>  meets your needs. Have your loan officer  explain all options until you
  fully understand what is being presented to you. Don't be afraid to ask questions.<a

  alt=\"mortgage refinancing\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<em>The third tip</em> is to discuss all
  fees with your loan officer. Remember, fees are how loan officers get paid and you
  should know how much you are paying your loan officer. Loan officers are often willing
  to negotiate their fees as well. They are paid by points, with one point being one
  percent of the total loan amount. Ask your loan officer how many points they are
  willing to do your loan for.<p><em>The last tip</em> is to  get a good faith estimate.
  A good faith estimate  is a list of all fees and costs associated with your loan.
  All loan officers are required to give a good  faith estimate to the borrower. This
  \ should be completed within three days of applying for the loan.\r\n\r\n<strong>So
  what do you look  for in a good faith estimate of <a href=\"http://www.iloanshop.com/\">mortgage
  refinancing</a> ?</strong>\r\n\r\nLook over all fees such as processing, appraisal,
  title, escrow and especially the yield spread premium. Loan officers can get paid
  additional points by the lender to sell you a higher interest rate. You may be paying
  the loan officer 2 points for their services, while the lender will be paying them
  1 more point on the back end of the deal. So in the end, they end up with 3 points.
  You may be  okay with this and you may not. If not, be sure to discuss it with your
  loan officer and get him to either reduce his origination fees or get a lower interest
  rate.We all want to save money and a mortgage refinance is a  great way to do that.
  Be an informed borrower, find a good loan officer and you'll avoid having a big
  headache. I hope these <strong>mortgage refinancing tips</strong> will be useful
  to you.\r\n\r\n"
