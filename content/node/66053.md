  body: "Thanks Kent. Is this the most up-to-date that Adobe has published (it's dated
    2007 - three years ago) and is it what Adobe is now using?\r\n\r\nI've got a recent
    Linotype font that's using .onum, .prop, and .onumprop as the numerical suffixes.
    (This assumes of course that the default is tabular. It also uses .nominator (rather
    than .numerator).\r\n\r\nThere's a thread somewhere that has a discussion on numeral
    conventions (.lnum_pnum, .lnum_tnum, .onum_pnum, .onum_tnum) but is this any sort
    of accepted standard or just robust, logical good practice?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<em>...is this any sort of accepted standard or just robust, logical good
    practice?</em>\r\n\r\nThere appear to be house standards that vary considerably
    from foundry to foundry.\r\n\r\nI must admit I use an antiquated system I adopted
    before I fully understood the way OpenType works.\r\nIt might be a good idea to
    have a widely observed standard, e.g.\r\n\r\n.plf (proportional lining figure)\r\n.tlf
    (tabular lining figure)\r\n.posf (proportional oldstyle figure)\r\n.tlf (tabular
    oldstyle figure)\r\n\r\nFollowing on, a set of cap-height lining figures, to be
    deployed in the \"case\" feature, would be suffixed \".plf.case\" or \"tlf.case\",
    to distinguish them from three-quarter height lining figures, which it is assumed
    would be the default lining figures, \".plf\" and \".tlf\".\r\n\r\nI suspect that
    the lack of a standard system is the result of a \"why bother?\" attitude caused
    by  the fundamental flaw in the OpenType figure system, namely that there is no
    way of identifying what style the default is just by looking at its name (it will
    always be the inscrutable e.g. \"one\") -- the only way is through a process of
    elimination.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThe solution may be to have a duplicate set of glyphs
    for the default figure style, with the appropriate suffix, so that all four basic
    figure suffixes are represented in the font.\r\n\r\nThat way, a layout engine
    could always get the correct glyph, even without the appropriate OpenType feature.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nAlso
    related: the need to have separate sets of superior figures for mathematical and
    reference purposes, i.e./e.g. both \"onesuperior\" and \"one.sups\"."

  body: "I don't think absolute standardization is important. I think some logic is
    useful. But it can be internal, working logic for any given working group. If
    you're a one-person studio, it can be personal idiosyncratic logic, if you want.\r\n\r\nI
    believe Adobe has started varying from some of what is expressed in that document,
    but the principles still seem sound. \r\n\r\nI seem to remember some recent Adobe
    Pro fonts with groups suffixed with random single letters. I presume this is just
    to make it easier to key all these alts when writing features. Having to type
    long suffixes over and over can get tedious, as well as prone to typos. \r\n\r\nThe
    flip-side is the challenge of remembering what random suffix goes with what alternate.\r\n\r\nNick
    [Shinn] -- I don't think you want a double period there in your <em>.plf.case</em>
    example. I believe that would lead to parsing problems when devolving. You might
    be better with <em>.plf_case</em> instead. \r\n\r\n"
