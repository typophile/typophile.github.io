    see the typefaces?

    try http://www.whatfontis.com/ too.\r\nAlso, for E, you could search for \"initials\"
    and \"ornate\"."

    where the answers came from, it could be an exercise in initiative.\r\n\r\nFor
    the OP, http://www.reddit.com/r/typography/ might be able to help you out (in
    addition to the experts here! more eyes, etc), and I recommend making a gallery
    of these images on imgur.com\r\n\r\nI'm sure I've seen your first 'a' somewhere,
    I'll get back to you if I find it."

    of the project is to find efficient ways to identify fonts, ways that we can later
    use in our future professional life, so \r\ntechnically, if it works, this wouldn't
    be cheating... :b "

    also, what have your colleagues been doing? Are there similar posts within Typophile
    from/by them?\r\nPost us the link for the reddit thread, if you should make one,
    I'm curious how the hivemind will respond. Also, reddit is a great resource for
    this kind of endeavour.\r\n\r\n...still...can't...find...the 'a' !!"
