  that this typeface is used all over Vancouver, BC, almost as though it were the
  official face of the city.  Here it is used in a credit union logo, but I'll post
  additional samples as I find them.  Any thoughts?"

  body: "Almost every city has a font that gets (over)used -- in Vancouver, you see
    infinite multitudinous flavours of Dax.\r\n\r\nHere in Calgary, they really overuse
    Benguiat and Optima. The former shows up in everything from exceptionally bad
    gyro shops to the bizarre version used by the <a href=\"http://www.cbestaffassociation.ab.ca/\">support
    staff workers from the local public school board</a>.\r\n\r\nThe latter belongs
    to the <strong>oh, aren't we just so terribly serious and important?</strong>
    brigade -- <a href=\"http://www.calgary.ca\">The City of Calgary</a> (see the
    upper left corner) and <a href=\"http://www.ucalgary.ca\">The University of Calgary</a>
    (upper right corner).\r\n\r\nFeh to all of them!"

  body: Thanks to you both.  Yes, it looks like the sample above is Dax, but with
    a custom-bendy V and y.
