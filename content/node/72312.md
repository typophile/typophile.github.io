  a long time, trying to find the font used in the attached image. At this point,
  I'm fairly certain Time Life actually customized their own font for this particular
  CD series of theirs, but I just wanted to make one final effort in attempting to
  find out what this font is.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time in reading and I hope
  you have a pleasant day.\r\n\r\n~ TEF"
