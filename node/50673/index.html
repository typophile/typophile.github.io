  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">G'day guys,

I need to come up with some maps of continents, eg. India, Cambodia etc, for a book I'm producing and I'm wondering how designers normally go about it in the right way. Is there a good online resource with simple map outlines? can I use a few different sources and come up with a composite that doesn't rely too heavily on any of the originals? does NASA have such a thing?
thanks guys, I'm a bit stumped

Generally does anyone know if this is what designers normally do, (use stock maps) or do they composite a few different maps so that the result doesn't appear derivative? What are other people's experience? If I can figure out an option that won't cost $100 a map that would be ideal,

I'm really after pretty basic kind of political map forms -- I found a vector map from <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:BlankMap-World.png">  wikipedia </a> that seems to be OK to use, maybe I'll go with this. Do you think there are any issues with using this? I guess my concern is that the map itself is not copyrighted but it may be produced from something that is.</div>

I just checked Geoatlas and it seems you have to buy Cd-Roms to get the maps 
National Geographic seems intended for educators not for those wanting to reproduce commercially
And if I use maps off openstreetmap I have to distribute my book free from copyright
hm ... still wondering what I should do...

However, I think the CIA has solved my problem (I never thought I'd get to say something like that). It has something called a factbook with lots of detailed maps which are all, apparently, in the <a href = "https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/contributor_copyright.html"> Public domain </a>
thanks for all your help</div>

The legalese can be very complicated and it does vary from country to country. Those last maps are quite interesting but I don't know if you can modify them for your or your clients' needs.

Well, that gets back to it being derivative of geography. Which no one (yet) holds a copyright on. Though I'm sure there are some lawyers working on that as we speak.</div>

I've purchased vector stock maps and then modified them to reflect a particular theme or illustrative style. I'm not sure if that's "standard" I suppose ideally it's best to have a budget and commission an artist. Even with purchased stock maps, I often just use it as a template to draw my own version which hopefully takes some of the "stock-ness" from the piece and gives it a more unique look.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks Kirsten,

In a perfect world commissioning an artist would work the best, I wonder if anyone except a very small percentage do this. Just out of interest, which company do you purchase the stock maps from?

I'm reasonably satisfied that these CIA maps will form a good basis for what I need. If they are in the public domain then I reckon they are fair game for style modifications.
