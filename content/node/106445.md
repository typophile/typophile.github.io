  and loves art nouveau. I thought, \"Hey, I don't think I've ever seen an art nouveau
  website!\"\r\n\r\nNow, the fun part... Given that art nouveau has a largely lyrical,
  hand-drawn, flowing aesthetic... How do I pull this off on the web? I'm not a fan
  of relying on imagery. I like to liken HTML+CSS to ante-linotype typesetting. You
  got yer box, see? and you got some stuff to break up the box, and some fonts and
  metal bits, and color, and texture. Make it work, pal. \r\n\r\nSo, I know that there
  isn't going to be a typeface that completely captures this. But I have to start
  somewhere. My first thought is Arnold B\xF6cklin, which is sad, I know. Maybe P22
  Eaglefeather? \r\n\r\nI have a Typekit account, and am no stranger to installing
  my own webfonts.\r\n\r\nAlso, the lettering.js plugin comes to mind.\r\n\r\nI'd
  also appreciate if anybody has some links to art nouveau-inspired web designs! I've
  exhausted my Google-fu at this point.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nHeinous"

  body: Hi Heinous - how about the attached?  It's a modern reinterpretation of Art
    Nouveau.  Forgive the self promotion, but I'd should know, since I designed it
    myself! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aspidistra_5973.jpg]
