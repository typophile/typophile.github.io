  resource they provided me is a business card, which i have problem with tracing
  because of the small resolution an poor quality.\r\n\r\nI suspect it's some type
  of font installed on a basic windows machine, or a font downloaded from dafont or
  something. It would really help me if someone could help identify it. Thanks in
  advance\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/biglietti_3830.jpg]"
