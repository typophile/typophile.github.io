  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi.</p>
<p>My question regarding this subject is double.
First obviously, clarify who designed the logo 
and if it was ever turned into a whole typeface?
<a href="http://www.ac-dc.net/">http://www.ac-dc.net/</a></p>
<p>My second questions is a bit more legally-wise.
This is a wellknown logo,
and it is easy to see it around,
being sold printed to t-shirts aand other parafernalia.</p>
<p>Is all this merchandising legal?
Has the use of the logo a liscence agreement with the designer?
Is it ilicit to use it with out previous consent from the band or the designer?</p>
<p>it is not like i am going to open a &ldquo;club de fans of AC/DC&rdquo;
and sell merchandising of them to make a living.</p>
<p>All this questions are for better knowledge of subject,</p>
<p>Here the last follow up questions,
is until what point is it legal or ilegal tu use this or another logo,
and tweek it for a new design.</p>
<p>In my case, i have designed a t-shirt for a limited editions brand in NY
and have used the same letterstyle to create a satire or parody,
as asked by my clientes&hellip; Basically I was asked to change AC/DC to AD/HD&hellip;
Now the cliente and friends want to printed for a limeted edition of 120 Tshirts,
but are unsure about if it is legal or not.</p>
<p>Please let me know your thought and share your knowledge about subject.
Surely Miss Tiffany will have to say.
To her or to however can bring light to subject, 
thanks.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know for certain who designed the original logo, I&rsquo;m betting it was Gerard Huerta as well. Ray Larabie&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/squealer/">Squealer</a> is clearly based on the AC/DC logo.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I want to clarify some things regarding the AC/DC logo. In July of 1976 I was hired by Bob Defrin of Atlantic Records to design some lettering for the AC/DC album called &ldquo;High Voltage.&rdquo; This was not a logo, but lettering for the album. In April of 1977 he hired me to design the current orange beveled AC/DC logo for an album. This was just a job like any other record job: you did some sketches and you did a finish. I have never really used that art for promoting myself as it was probably one of only two jobs in my career that shared an unusual quality in my work: it was all made out of straight lines. This was not particularly virtuosic for one who prided himself on custom hand lettering. I have recently resurrected my credit for it as it seems to touch a lot of generations. This and some guitar playing has indeed made me cool with all my children&rsquo;s friends. How&rsquo;s that?!</p>
<p>I would like to make one other comment as to the design, as this seems to be often disputed, particularly with writers who speculate and not seek a source. This logo seems to be one of the first heavy metal, goth-style logos, but its origins are misunderstood. No, there are not meant to be any fascist undertones&hellip;I designed a piece of lettering for a live Blue Öyster Cult  album for John Berg called &ldquo;On Your Feet or On Your Knees.&rdquo; The album showed a church on the front with the Cults' limo on the cover. The back was a photo by Don Hunstein of me holding a bible with the credits on it. My thought on the cover was to take the metallic car marque idea and combine it with lettering reminicent of the Bible. I remembered this lettering when designing one of the AC/DC sketches and used this as my source. So you see that this logo is more Gutenberg than goth&hellip;
As for typefaces, I have seen an attempt in the December issue of Guitar World magazine with Dimebag Darrell on the cover, but I had nothing to do with that. As for parodies, they are what they are.</p>

<p>thanks you Gerarld for your answer,
i coudnt seem to find the logo in any of the portfolios in your website.
I wanted to be sure about what I was guessing and what i remembered from last Typecon.
Gerard&rsquo;s talk was something like 10am&hellip; ;)</p>
<p>although very enriching to read, 
i dont know if the answers regarding what i was asking where clear.</p>
<p>in the AC/DC logo.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is all this merchandising legal?</li>
<li>Has the use of the logo a liscence agreement with the designer?</li>
<li>Is it ilicit to tweek it with out previous consent from the band or the designer?</li>
</ul>
<p>as for the particular design AD/HD, 
it was postponed due to this issue
even before this thread, thats why it.</p>
<p>thanks all.</p>

<p>– Probably not, somebody will have ripped it off to sell cheap t-shirts somewhere.
– The licence probably belongs to the band or the record label.
– Are you likely to get consent to parody/satirise the band? With or without that consent, are you doing something that you would be happy if somebody did to your work? I think if you have any doubt it is probably worth getting a proper legal opinion before proceeding.</p>
