  were being designed around 1916 in different countries.

  body: Thanks, i guess i should have mentioned that i am basing a project on Johnston's
    typeface, and i wanted to see what other typefaces were being designed at the
    same time he done his for the Underground.

  body: "I'm assuming that much of the Underground signage would have been hand lettered,
    not produced from type.\r\nI wonder to what extent that informs the shapes of
    the letters in this early example of comprehensive, controlled branding.\r\nIt
    might be worth investigating manuals of sign-writing/lettering/trade cards from
    the same era.\r\nThis from 1933. Note the two \"S\"s in the title, different,
    but both constructed from arcs of circle.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/33(8)_3792.jpg]"

  body: Thanks for all your suggestions, I will definitely try and find some other
    examples of sign-writing/lettering, and thank you for the image you posted Nick
    Shinn, interesting point about the difference in the 'S's.

  body: Luke if you can get down to St Bride in London they have (IIRC) lots of source
    material for Johnston (and Gill, who was briefly a part of the Johnston project).

  body: Thats good to know, i did go there the other month, but was before i had settled
    on a subject if i can afford to ill try and go up again after Christmas. I have
    contacted Crafts Study Centre in Farnham asking if it would be possible to view
    their collection of his work, as it is closer, but still waiting on a reply.

  body: "Nick Shinn, I've noticed that some of the Victoria line platform signs at
    King's Cross still use that particular S. I managed to do a rubbing as the lettering
    is ever so slightly raised - there are bones in the middle of the S - it is indeed
    two arcs. Perhaps the whole sign wasn't Johnston per se, but I wasn't able to
    tell the difference at the time. Only at King's Cross though\u2026\r\n\r\nI'd
    upload the rubbing but unfortunately can't find it."
