  of typefaces. I currently use Suitcase X1, and am running Mac OSX. I have attempted
  to print preview pages from suitcase, but it's very limited with regard to sizes,
  layouts per page, etc.\r\n\r\nCan any of you recommend a program (for download or
  purchase) that will allow me to customize my printouts?\r\n\r\nYour help is greatly
  appreciated.\r\n\r\n-Will-"
