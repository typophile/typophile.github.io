  body: "> meanings of symbols or ornaments?\r\n\r\nHistory?\r\n\r\nThis style is
    around 3084 B.C. -- Porti\r\n\r\nThe divisions of a circle are by 4 in Egypt and
    early Crete; by 6 in Greece, Assyria, Syria, Italy. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut you need to
    be more specific with your search.\r\n"

    and <a href=\"http://www.whats-your-sign.com/images/NAWorldHopi.jpg\">here</a>.\r\nWhich
    represents the world, with the four bars being north/east/south/west,  the outermost
    points on the horizon where the sun passes through the year, the solstice/equinox
    points. The circles represent the \"four nations, which came to the world to keep
    balance\".\r\n\r\nBut then again, your symbol might mean something else or nothing
    specific. :)\r\n"
