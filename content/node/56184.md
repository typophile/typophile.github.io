  I feel like I've seen it.\r\n\r\nAny web people know if there's a way in Javascript
  or something to have a popup window appear in the main page?\r\n\r\nI found a rollover
  popup, but that isn't very good.\r\n\r\nThanks so much."

    or even more generally - google for an AJAX UI library.

    cases like help windows (which by definition aren\u2019t unrequested). They\u2019re
    user-hostile (in fact a usability disaster), the mark of an assholish and incompetent
    Web developer, and, for good measure, a WCAG violation.\r\n\r\nNext you\u2019ll
    be asking us for help typesetting a novel in Arial.\r\n\r\n\u2014  \r\nJoe Clark\r\nhttp://joeclark.org/"

  body: "I once read a novel typeset in Arial. After about 100 pages I wanted to rip
    my eyes out and after 200 pages I wanted to rip the author's eyes out. It was
    a self-published novel, and a decent story, but I'm really hoping if he ever finishes
    his next novel that he asks for help with the typesetting and doesn't do it in
    Arial again.\r\n\r\nI think there's a time and place for pop-up windows, myself,
    but Joe is most astute than I am, in general, so I'll defer to his opinion.\r\n"

    that opens a large image on the page itself, that's going to be what is commonly
    called 'lightbox'. There are various scripts out there to accomplish this. If
    you're using jQuery, there's the 'thickbox' clone. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "The big problem is really the definition of what a \"new window\" is. Using
    the standard desktop browser scenario, it's easy to understand that it opens a
    separate instance of a browser window. But when you're using a handheld device,
    or a screen-reading device, or a text browser, what consists of a new window?
    Your design needs to account for that.\r\n\r\nOld-skool pop up windows <em>can</em>
    serve certain specific purposes, but it should be as Joe said not \"unrequested\".
    As long as the user has a choice, or isn't forced into opening a new window, they
    can be used.\r\n\r\nGiven what you are asking for, which isn't very specific,
    the more specific term that aluminum is speaking of is technically known as a
    \"modal window\" and can, and should be, quite accessible. Lightbox, Thickbox,
    Greybox, they're all just different implementations of a modal window that doesn't
    open a new instance of a browser window. All simply display a part of your page
    that already exists, or is requested through AJAX, and hopefully all information
    is otherwise accessible to those not using javascript. \r\n\r\nHope you find what
    you're looking for!"
