body: "Hey, this is a layout draft for my basic computer design class. I've been trying
  to rework it for weeks, but decided the layout early on, so I need some input into
  how to change it.  I'm trying to figure out how to move around the logo, or if it's
  too big, but I need some ideas to try out. Thanks!\r\n\r\nEDIT (4/23/09): ADDED
  NEW DRAFT.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Do you need the panel? What about printing directly over the water either
    dark type or drop out, depending on what works? The panel is pretty dull. Do something
    more interesting with the type as well. Typographically it could be an ad for
    anything.

  body: "She said to have a white panel on the bottom 1/3rd of the page, but I think
    it's more of a guideline because she doesn't want the completely incompetent people
    in our class making illegible ads.  So choose a different font for the headline
    and such?\r\n\r\nThanks for the ideas, I'll try them out."

  body: Is that implying that there is no use of visual hierarchy whatsoever? The
    first thing that I actually tried was putting the headline at the top, but we're
    apparently supposed to have all the text on the lower third of the page. I wasn't
    sure if the text in the bottom of the box should just be made larger, and into
    two lines instead of one, or if it should be a little smaller and not bolded.
    I haven't ever designed an ad before. Some specific suggestions would be really
    helpful. But thanks.
