  body: I don't think they've changed that design since I was in art school - '87/'88.
    Might be pre-digital.

  body: I have some old pads from around 1980 with that design format. I don't think
    it is from much earlier than that. I have some old bp pads from around 1975 with
    a different design--black cover, but with Eurostile type.
