  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>We were asked to produce a book that shows off  <BR>our capabilities. Total creative freedom! The horror... <BR> <BR>The basic idea is that all five designers in our  <BR>studio collaborate on a book that tells the story  <BR>of &#39;Beautiful&#39;, a kind of legend-like tale. Each  <BR>one of us gets two spreads, and a &#39;transfer page&#39;  <BR>preceding your section that incorporates an  <BR>element from the designer of the previous spreads  <BR>and another &#39;transfer page&#39; to hand over an  <BR>element from your pages to the designer of the  <BR>following spreads. <BR> <BR>This is my first spread. At this point in the story  <BR>&#39;Beautiful&#39; has just met the first &#39;Ugly&#39; and starts to  <BR>feel very ill. It gets from bad to worse throughout  <BR>the page. <BR> <BR>Let me know what you think. I&#39;ll provide additional  <BR>information if need be. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10929.jpg" alt="screenshot.jpg"> <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a PDF to allow close-up viewing. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: Showcase_Y_p18-19-10930.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*659.6*Showcase_Y_p18%2d19%2epdf*Showcase_Y_p18%2d19%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">Showcase_Y_p18-19.pdf<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Showcase_Y_p18-19-10930.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Showcase_Y_p18-19.pdf</b></a> (659.6 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey there. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately I can&#39;t read the words, which would help in my understanding.   <BR> <BR>First off, my initial reaction to the type was enjoyment and interest, except for the type at the bottom, which is wavy and slightly dated looking.    I just don&#39;t like the wavy vector path type elements.  The type up top and before this is fine.  Your use of the letterforms of the different fonts is engaging. <BR> <BR>Now, in terms of concept.  I am not seeing it that much.  What/where is beautiful in this piece?  The &#34;nervous&#34; man?  The brain ties into your concept I will say, it looks like it is ill...hungover <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>But I am not seeing the beauty here. <BR> <BR>Ciao!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I must say I&#39;m not entirely sure about the bottom  <BR>type treatment: that&#39;s where he starts to get  <BR>feverish, so I wanted to invoke an atmosphere of  <BR>halucination. It&#39;s not a path treatment though &#40;I  <BR>hate those too&#41;, it&#39;s all done by hand with a  <BR>photocopy machine. The ole&#39; Terry Jones routine. <BR> <BR>With this piece I pay tribute to my influences from  <BR>my Art Academy days: 90s deconstructivism and  <BR>neo-goth. So it could be slightly dated looking,  <BR>but I hope to add a contemporary twist. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try to whup up a rough translation. It won&#39;t  <BR>be easy because there&#39;s a lot of word play and  <BR>poetic license, but I agree it would help to make  <BR>sense of the piece. Gimme till tomorrow. <BR> <BR>BTW There&#39;s no &#39;beautiful&#39; in my spreads: it got  <BR>lost in the previous double page. ;&#41; The images  <BR>are not meant to be taken literally.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; photocopy effect <BR> <BR>I can appreciate you doing this much more than I can simply putting type on a path. &#40;In this instance&#41; But, it seems there is too much separation. Between the horizontal and the curved. The visual play with scale and type is much more interesting, although with more of a mixture or transition &#40;segue&#41; from the one to the other it could also still work.  Perhaps you transition from the well-set type to the spastic too?  <BR> <BR>The large square skeleton is too heavy and seems to weigh [edit] that side down without purpose. <BR> <BR>I was reading into the images. The whole, &#34;beauty is only skin deep, but ugly goes to the bone&#34; thought came to me. <BR> <BR>the starkness of your type, black and white, matches &#40;for me&#41; the starkness of the line drawing. But, it doesn&#39;t seem to work &#40;for me&#41; with the photo. <BR> <BR>Granted. A lot depends on what precedes and what follows. It could be that those spreads set the pace and follow the lead of this spread.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree the transition is too abrupt as it is now,  <BR>but I wanted some extra input before deciding which  <BR>way to go. <BR>Actually I was going to segue the large compositions  <BR>into the curved/distorted type by slightly distorting  <BR>the former, but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to do it  <BR>because for the moment I quite like the crispness of  <BR>the clusters. <BR> <BR>BTW Which type families did I use? ;&#41; Let me have it,  <BR>Tiff! <BR> <BR>I thought I had the pictorial elements balanced out,  <BR>but I&#39;ll reconsider the square x-ray pic.</div>
