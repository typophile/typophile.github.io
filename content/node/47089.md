  does anybody know which typeface was used for the early editions of James Joyce's
  Ulysses?  Shakespeare and Company had it printed by Maurice Darantiere in Dijon,
  if that bit of information helps.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.sc.edu/library/spcoll/amlit/paris/utitle.jpg|Ulysses
  title page]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHunting around I came across this [[http://www.typophile.com/node/33033
  | thread]], but the later American editions are set in something else.  \r\n\r\nThanks,
  \r\nJames\r\n"

  body: "There is a titling face shown in Jaspert's \"Enyclopaedia of Type Faces\"
    called Lyons Titling which seems to match this lettering. Unfortunately the alphabet
    is incomplete, but the book says Elzevir's upper case is based on this design
    by Louis Perrin about 1846.\r\n\r\nIf 1922 is indeed the date of publication of
    this edition, this typeface would have been available.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks for the replies guys.  \r\n\r\nSammy Roman is close, but the way the
    strokes taper gives it a little diffenent feel.  After a little more digging it
    looks like the Lyons Titling / Elzevir upper case might be right.  That is, I
    found a webpage that mentioned that Darantiere used Elsevir type.  \r\n\r\nI also
    came across a citation for a John Ryder paper entitled \"Editing Ulysses Typographically\"
    \ but I had to ILL it and it hasn't arrived.  \r\n\r\nI'll let you know what I
    find, \r\nThanks again, \r\nJames\r\n"

  body: "These are Theophile Beaudoire's copies of Perrin's Lyons capitals. They used
    to be very common, but nobody uses them anymore. I was working on a revival of
    them, but the trouble is that each master size has different proportions. I've
    been meaning to make these available ... someday soon.\r\n\r\n(Note, I did not
    make the terminal on the J pointy, but it's the same font)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beaudoire_5072.gif]"
