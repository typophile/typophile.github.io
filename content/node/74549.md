    Unfortunately, the only distributor that has it, Bitstream, is not allowed (by
    ITC) to distribute it. However, it was included on the Bitstream TypeShop CD-ROM
    back in the nineties. You may be able to find a copy of that on eBay or somewhere.\r\n\r\n(It
    baffles me that ITC prohibits Bitstream from distributing it, yet does not offer
    it itself. There are a few other early ITC fonts that fall into this legal purgatory
    at Bitstream, such as ITC Gorilla and ITC Grizzly. ITC has also not seemed interested
    in releasing digital versions of it's early display fonts, such as ITC Bernase,
    ITC/LSC Book, ITC/LSC Caslon, ITC Caslon Headline, LSC Condensed, ITC Didi, ITC
    Milano, ITC Tom's Roman, ITC Firenze and more. Many of these are regularly sought
    after here on Typophile.)"

  body: While wondering about the fate of some of the early ITC faces, somewhat similarly
    I ponder the fate of some of the small and apparently short-lived (Carnase) WTC
    collection. Favrile I've only seen pirated. WTC Goudy (is to Goudy OS as ITC Garamond
    is to metal Garamonds) & Our Bodoni have shown up recently (MyFonts says owned
    by ATF/Kingsley; ITC & Fonts.com say URW), but why not the full "library"?

    a lot.\r\n\r\nBut, if say, ITC Grouch is not available anymore, meaning, the option

    in your system???\r\n\r\nIt would be EXTREAMLY appreciated if you could send them
    to my email.\r\n\r\nabbyisvitamin@gmail.com\r\n\r\nonly if it's not too much as
