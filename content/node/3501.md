  body: actually, the &#34;blurring technique&#34; is not some <BR>great technique.
    <BR>It&#39;s simply applying <BR>the blur or gaussian blur in photoshop and <BR>then
    using threshold or brightness/contrast or mode&#62;bitmap <BR>to achieve varying
    levels of blurred rounding. <BR> <BR>But here the key letters are not identical
    so <BR>i don&#39;t think the final result could be called <BR>a font.

  body: All the titles for Se7en were done optically, on film, by hand. There&#39;s
    a bit of info about it on the DVD itself, if I remember correctly, plus there
    was an article in either Print or CA when it won some awards. Truly nice work
    by a really great designer.

    <BR> <BR>Sean, i&#39;m curious if the work was done on an <BR>Avid system ...
    i&#39;d like to find out more, especially <BR>what is meant by optically, on film,
    by hand. <BR> <BR>Not doubting the info, but just find the information compelling
    <BR>and would like to learn more. <BR> <BR>I saw a Kyle Cooper book at B&amp;N,
    but did not <BR>have a chance to check it out. <BR> <BR>thanks, <BR> <BR>bj

    NudE looks like it is based on Helvetica.

    are identical to the ones found  <BR>in Truth, upon closer investigation there
    are some  <BR>inconsistencies that make me believe you may be  <BR>right. They
    probably both achieved the same result  <BR>by using the same technique. I apologize

  body: bj, I&#39;m almost positive that the titles for seven were done on film. There&#39;s
    a variety of techniques to do this, but I would guess that the copy &#40;both
    type and handwritten&#41; was printed negative on photo-composition film, a strong
    source of light projected on the back, and filmed &#40;16 or likely 35 mm&#41;
    from the front; using any kind of transparent distorting device &#40;a loupe,
    a drinking glass, a piece of plastic,...&#41; in front of the lens to achieve
    the light distortion look.  <BR> <BR>Filming at different speeds will give you
    also a variety of effects. <BR> <BR>The final touches, I&#39;m sure, will be added
    in After Effects, where you can composite the filmed stuff whith the digital photoshop
    rendering of the same type if you want to, and then with the actual footage that,
    in seven&#39;s case, was shot specifically for the open. <BR> <BR>You can, of
    course, do all this in the computer, but there&#39;s nothing that can compare
    to the richness and the randomness of  using real film.

  body: As I remember from the article I read, the whole sequence was optically composited,
    the way it would have been done 20&#43; years ago. Film positives, negatives,
    etc were all put together and filmed by the title designer. It may have been color
    timed on an Avid, but certainly there was no use of After Effects. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    sure you could come close to duplicating the effect now in AE, but I still think
    it&#39;s cooler that it was done by hand.
