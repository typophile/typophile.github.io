body: "I bought a pile of 1940s-50s Swedish poetry books yesterday at a second-hand
  book store, among them this 1947 collection. At first I assumed the cover was lettered
  (because 1940s), but on closer inspection it's clearly type, with exactly repeating
  characters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_0135_lr_5093.jpg]\r\n\r\nSorry
  for the lighting issues. Attached is as high-res as my phone camera allows if it
  helps; it's actually a fair bit crisper than that in real life."

  body: Thanks Albert for finding the original. I always feel a bit uncomfortable
    with Scriptorium David  Nalle fonts. Never know if it's an original design or
    it has been redrawn. That's also why I used "a match" thinking the original would
    show up...

    of well known typefaces. Palatino, ITC Garamond, Friz Quadrata, ITC Benguiat,
    Americana, Trump Mediaeval \u2026 Just to name a few."

  body: "That\u2019s Post-Antiqua. It was designed by Herbert Post in 1932 for the
    Berthold type foundry in Berlin.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/post-antiqua-bq/\r\nProcopius
    is a match, but the spacing seems to be corrupted, try Ja \u2026 or type in nbnjn.
    The side bearings have probably been set on an equal value, calculated from the
    x-extremes. The apostrophe, the quotes and the @ look as if they were taken from
    Arial. The euro is missing etc. \u2026"

  body: "In light of the above, I changed the solving credit to Albert Jan. I hope
    you don't mind, Ryuk, thanks for your effort as well!\r\n\r\nIs it just me or
    have both of the digital versions significantly tempered the most unique aspect
    of the type on the title page, the extreme letter widths on A and W?"

  body: "It's interesting looking in Jaspert's \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\", because
    that book shows \"Post Roman\" as a Berthold typeface from 1937 that seems to
    match this sample. It has a lower case, but the showings include \"Post Title\",
    which is all caps.  The Medium weights of each face has a very wide A and W, noticeably
    wider than in the Light and Bold weight versions.\r\n\r\nThe digital \"Post-Antiqua\"
    seems to have called the Bold version \"Medium\" and has only two weights now.\r\n\r\n-
