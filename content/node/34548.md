      but now with your mouse you click on the right below corner of the spread. (When
      you look carefully you can even see a pagecorner moving)\r\n\r\nBTW: The question
      on the website is a continuation of a 10 page interview with H&FJ which features
      in the hard copy 200% magazine. In the interview they talk about their typefacedesigns,
      like Retina & Gotham, and the thought processes behind them."

  body: "\"well, aluminum it\u2019s quite easy. Just flip through it like a normal
    magazine\"\r\n\r\nSee, if it were a normal magazine made out of paper and sitting
    on my desk, the interface would have been intuited by mere context.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it being a web site, the concept of flipping pages makes little sense outside
    of 'hey, look at how cute this is'. \r\n\r\nRegardless, I still had no idea where
    to click. I click the contorted lady, get told to turn off pop-up blocking (ugh)
    turn it off, click again, get told again to turn it off (crappy javascript on
    their part) launch the page, see the TOC, and then...what? I can't 'flip' pages
    from there.\r\n\r\nOh! I see, I have to click the article in the TOC first, then
    wait for the wet paint to come in, and THEN see the page curl, THEN get to the
    article.\r\n\r\nYeesh. That was 200% more work than necessary ot just hear them
    say 'it's really really ugly'. (maybe intended?) Whew. I need to take a nap now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nA friend of mine sent me the url to this forum as I was
      disgusted with the London Olympics logo and after reading all the comments I
      just had to see that 200% website for myself.\r\n\r\nI just registered to this
      forum to react to all the comments. I think a positive comment is in place.
      Like Aluminum I had troubles with my popup blocker too. I have that a lot. But
      when I turn off the blocker I have to reload the webpage in order for the javascript
      to work again. This was also the case with the 200% website. Besides, I found
      it ok that they have given people the option to open the website in the current
      window. Some websites just force popups down your throat and don't offer an
      alternative.\r\n\r\nI agree the navigation isn't common to websites. Although
      when you think of it as a magazine it makes sense. I like the online magazines
      at www.magwerk.com which have a similar navigation. I guess you have to be openminded
      to grasp new ways of navigation.\r\n\r\nOverall I don't think the website is
      that bad and added it to my favorites. I like online magazines. Although they
      are missing the character of a real magazine it saves paper and usually are
      free :)\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of ordering the magazine, it's a bit pricey. The
      Hoefler and Frere Jones article and the Marc Quinn article should be interesting
      though!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMaximilian\r\n"
