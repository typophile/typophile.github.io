    on your image.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like me to explain in more detail I'd be happy
    to do so, just let me know.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There are a lot of ways one is mask as Liquid sky said but you don't need
    to do a vector mask it depends on the effect but i think that the portrait can
    be seen inside the letters using letters as mask.\r\nOther way could be using
    the blend of the layer, layer of text on top of the photo and then see the blend
    options like \"screen\" and so.\r\nThe easier ways to do that are on Photoshop.\r\n\r\nJoel

    the designer\r\nuses the different weights of a font to build\r\nthe image...yes
    it will take a while but it will\r\nlook better.\r\n"

  body: "Well, here is how I would do it:\r\n\r\n\u2014 Create a new image in Photoshop
    with a white background and drag in the picture to which you want to apply the
    effect.\r\n\r\n\u2014 Duplicate the layer containing your chosen picture and set
    the opacity of the bottom one to about 10%\r\n\r\n\u2014 Create a layer of text
    that covers your subject matter, filling it with whatever text you please.\r\n\r\n\u2014
    Right-click (or control-click) on the text layer in the Layers Palette and select
    \"Create Work Path\".\r\n\r\n\u2014 Select the top picture layer (the one at 100%
    opacity) and then go to the menu bar and choose Layer>Vector Mask>Current Path\r\n\r\n\u2014
    Hide the text layer by clicking the little eye next to the \"T\" in the Layers
    Palette and you're done! (Just click on the background layer to get rid of the
    outline of the vector mask)\r\n\r\n"

    Depends on what kind of results you want.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod one: \r\nhttp://asciiconvert.com/\r\nhttp://www.ascii-art-generator.com/\r\nhttp://www.altarsoft.com/ascii_art_maker.shtml\r\nhttp://www.network-science.de/ascii/\r\n\r\nMethod
    two:\r\nUse Illustrator's spray tool and experiment.\r\n\r\nMethod three: \r\nI
    guess this is how the sample image you have posted was been produced.\r\n\r\nCreate
    two layers in the the Photoshop. The top layer should be the text layer and the
    bottom one should have the image you want to apply the effect. Make sure that
    your text is set either in white or Black. Now select the top(text) layer and
    keep playing with the various layers/transperency modes. Shortcut for this: \"Shift\"
    + \"+\". \r\n"

    I did was put all the text in a layer in Photoshop with the original photo in
    another layer.  Right click on the layer with the text and click select pixels.
    \ Then invert the selection and change to the layer with the photo.  Hit delete
    and all the pixels that aren't the text will be erased leaving only the portions
    of the photo where there was text.  Hide the original text layer and presto, you've
    got what I did."
