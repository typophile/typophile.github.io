  typeface is:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/02-02-04_6478.gif] [img:sites/default/files/old-images/designact_3655.gif]
  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/02-01-02-D2_6040.gif]\r\n\r\nAt first i thought
  it was Norm's \"Simple\", but as you can see the letters Z, A, G, and the question
  mark is different.\r\n\r\nPlease help me solve this typographic mystery. I'm dying
  to know what typeface this is! \r\n\r\nThank you."
