  body: "Milton Glaser, Seymour Chwast, Herb Lubalin, Ed Sorel, Lou Dorfsman, and
    the list goes on... all attended Cooper Union at least ten to fifteen years BEFORE
    I got there! The only one of the above list I actually met is Lou Dorfsman. Herb
    started teaching typography at Cooper years AFTER I left. But EVERYONE's work
    was plastered all over so they left a lasting impression during my student years.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but not actually THAT OLD!"
