  body: After viewing the piece <em>in situ</em>, considering the fact that it's categorized
    under "Digitized" and looking at the artist's other work, I'd venture to say "not
    a font," but probably based on some hand-lettering guru's work. It reminds me
    a lot of Alphonso E. Tripp's work, but maybe not. If you check the friendsoftype
    feedback, you're not the only person who's dying to know...

  body: It's not really a similar face, but [[http://www.linotype.com/88772/carousel-family.html?PHPSESSID=b16172d882babdef0d739533876c5bfe&subviewmode=FONTS&samplestr=J+P+W+5|Carousel]]
    lives in the same universe. The 5 much rounder but the caps have a similar feel.
