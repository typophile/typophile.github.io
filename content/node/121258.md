  clear that a little PS brushing would do.\r\nnevertheless - i do like the elegance
  of the letters which at the same time are not distanced but inviting.\r\n\r\ni find
  it very hard to pinpoint it; this orphan has so many potential mommies and daddies!\r\n\r\nbit
  of a mash of UNIVERSAL and TITLING GOTHIC\r\nwith a little standard ct, helvetica
  & akzidenz-grotesk\r\netc\r\netc\r\n\r\nthanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/11111_5714.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/222222_4116.JPG]"

    or Condensed. The only digital alternative would probably be [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Vonness|Vonness]]
    which comes in these width variations.

  body: "thanks ryuk!\r\n\r\ni've looked into venus before - and (as far as i could
    tell) hmv actually used another venus font for the lp-filing-bar on their covers
    (a small white strip with neutral lettering above of the actual cover-art) for
    some years;\r\nthe thing was that those central joints in capital_r , _b, the
    middle bar in capital_e etc seemed much closer to the x-height than in the scanned
    font (hope that was not too far off the correct terminology)\r\n\r\n:)"
