  body: "I saw this book at Borders last time I was there.  From my quick inspection
    of the book, it looked like it was divided into a bunch of different case studies
    with the font, its designer and application.  But don't take my word for it, I
    just had a quick glance, but it looked like a really cool book, something I'd
    buy.\r\n\r\n(Hrant, it's the Borders on Sunset across from Arclight, if you're
    in the area.)"

  body: "Hrant,\r\n\r\nI hope they'll still have the book in stock.  If you haven't
    tried out Kabuki, close to Borders, they have a really good half-off sushi menu.
    \ We go there all the time.\r\n\r\nI haven't been to the bakery, but I'll check
    it out. From what I read online it looks like a great place, and I'm always game
    for trying new foods.  I'm usually in the Little Armenia/Thai Town area once a
    week."
