Chris, probably the phrase 'black art' as you & I know it is an English specific literary/poetic device coined by an overwrought romantic Victorian. Or something similar. I'll look into it.</div>

Kris, clearly there is some prescedent for associating the phrase 'The black art' with <cite>printing</cite>. I don't see anything that associates type design per se with "the black Art". Of course type design is pretty useless without printing but they are not the same thing. I think the distiction is valid. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are many things which even a dedicated scholar cannot completely reveal. Some things were never that clear and some facts are simply lost. But I do like John's reminder in that thread of yet another meaning. He says: <cite>

" So just why did the Church refer to printing as the "Black Arts". 

Did the term originate in the Church? Where and when? The term black art is used even today, in reference to anything that is understood only by initiates. At a recent Unicode conference, one of the text encoding gurus referred to digital type development as 'something of a black art'. He was not suggesting that there was anything negative, let alone diabolical, about type design, only that it was something that the majority of people don't understand very well. " </cite>

Yeah, I wasn't taking that definition literally. :-) When I was at university, one of my profs told us that printing was known as "the black art" in its early years. I like the church reference made above too, because I'm sure the catholic church felt threatened by the "spell" printing cast on the masses...  :-)

The OED is really your only reliable reference for word origins. 

The Wikipedia, well, test it once with a topic you really know something about. Dismal. Don't know much about a topic, it will do.

Printing was termed the black art. Don't know the origins. There were at least two journals with that title that focused on printing history.

This does need to be said. Martin Luther was a Catholic, to his dying day. He was not a proponent of the use of the printing press in spreading his "word."

The Catholic church did not connect printing to evil. It was the sponsor for, and proponent of, the development of "mechanical writing."

For Christ sakes.

		<div class="commentbody">"The mystery thrown over the operations of a Type foundry [says Vincent Figins II in 1855] within my own recollection (thirty-four years), and the still greater secrecy which had existed in my father's experience, testifies that the art had been perpetuated by a kind of Druidic or Masonic induction from the first.  An anecdote of my father's early struggles may illustrate this.  At the death of Mr. Joseph Jackson, whom my father had served ten years as apprentice and foreman, there was in progress for the University Press of Oxford a new fount of Double Pica Greek, which had progressed under my father's entire management.  The then delegates of that Press--the Rev. Dr. Randolph and the Rev. W. Jackson--suggested that Mr. Figgins should finish the fount himself.  This, with other offers of support from those who had previously known him, was the germ of his prosperity (which was always gratefully acknowledged).  But when he had undertaken this work, the difficulty presented iteself that he did not know where to find the punch-cutter.  No one knew his address; but he was supposed to be a tall man, who came in a mysterious way occasionally, whose name no one knew, but he went by the <em>sobriquet</em> of <em>'The Black Man'</em>.  This old gentleman, a very clever mechanic, lived to be a pensioner on my father's bounty--gratitude is perhaps the better word.  I knew him and could never understand the origin of his <em>sobriquet</em>, unless Black was meant for dark, mysterious, from the manner of his coming and going from Mr. Jackson's foundry."

		<div class="commentbody">My ITU lessons in printing put it down to the church's opposition to there being large amounts of bibles in circulation, where before the onset of printing bibles and other works were available only to the wealthy and the church. They realized that books would be availbale to the masses.

Additionall they could see that printing was going to make scribal work completely unncessarey.

Once printing was in full flower it was only a matter of a few decades before literacy spread over Europe, and at the same time books were printed in other than strictly Latin.

Those opposed to change dubbed it the Black Art, suggesting that it was the work of the devil. In the early years printers were thrown into prison and some were executed.

ITU probably isn't the best source.

A bible prior to printing would have cost the equivalent of 1.5 million dollars in today's money. They were only available to nobility and the church because no one else had any money whatsoever.

The development of Western printing also did two other things. Immediately, the block book was introduced, which provided access to whoever who wanted at a very low price. Which resulted in the decline of printing as represented by B42 and the Mainz Psalter. Also, it raised the price of the manuscript book ("scribal work"), which became the high end in the market for over a century. It did not in any way immediately eliminate the work of the scribe.

The dubbing of the Black Art thing, is really questionable. Printers were thrown into prison and executed, along with any others who violated the laws of the time. Very little to do with the devil, unless you were in Spain or France. Then it hardly mattered what your crime was.

Yeah, this is from Simon Wiesenthal, "the Nazi Hunter," in his writings on Columbus. 

Columbus was a converso, so had affiliation. I have a copy of a map he drew of the New World (the first) that was sent to his son, with the special code "sign."

But I was in error, while the "uncoverted" Jews were expurgated in 1492, the Inquisition in Spain began twelve years earlier. 

I've never been able to find the connection but it was suggested once that the trial and execution of Joan of Arc 1431 had some kind of impact (socially/culturally) on the development of printing.

Oh yeah. To get back to you. No, the "black art" is an obsolete term. It would have originally referred to printing in some regard rather than type design. 

Type wasn't even referred to as such until the early 18th century. Moxon never used the word type, he called them letters. And just who would have qualified as the first "type designer"? Schoeffer or Griffo or ?
