  body: Thanks, it is similar. I'd really like to find out what font it is, as I want
    to do some artwork/promotional material using it.

  body: This looks like one of the approximately bajillion shareware fonts from the
    late 90's inspired by David Carson. It's probably like finding a needle in a haystack.
    I'd check dafont, or some of those shareware sites.
