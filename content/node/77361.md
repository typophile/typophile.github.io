body: "so I've just began an idea of a simple hairline serif typeface.\r\nI am very
  early in the process of putting it together but I've come across a small dilemma:
  should I dot my /i/s and /j/s or do diamonds add a little class or sophistication?
  is there certain protocol for this or is entirely based on opinion, etc.\r\nI've
  attached the letters for reference.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ij_6255.jpg]\r\n\r\nthanks"

    a bit bigger so that they are optically more akin to the impression of the dots.\r\n"

  body: "thanks for namedropping.\r\nI really like the diamond, I just don't know
    how to implement the concept into other punctuation. \r\n\r\nI adjusted to +25%:
    looks much better. I'll update periodically.\r\n\r\nThanks again"

    draw inspiration from it. Among those: Peter Bilak''s Fedra.'

  body: Your tittles are very high, and need to be optically centered above the letters,
    not mathematically. I also don't think you should include both variants, but that's
    just me. They're such a big part of the design.

    with similar characteristics.

    version of Johnston has pinched diamonds.\r\n\r\nFrode, why not include different
    designs, if both are well executed then there is no problem, right?"

  body: "Fair point, Frode. If you want to licence the font then that might help create
    a personality, but then it might also be a selling point to have some alternatives!
    Changing the tittle does produce an unusually large change in overall appearance
    (dots always seem friendlier than blocks, for example), so it is worth bearing
    in mind.\r\n\r\nAny other interesting alternatives out there?"

  body: "Isn't there also some notion that diamond tittles, punctuation, etc. denote
    a kind of calligraphic thrust? That's how I always interpreted something like
    Kabel, that gets more brush stroke\u2013like (or woodcut-like, maybe) as it moves
    toward heavier weights. This goes even more for Fedra, but then it's fairly modulated. "
