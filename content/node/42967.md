  body: "Hello Jonathan,\r\nwhere are you coming from?\r\nDo you know Briar Press?\r\nhttp://www.briarpress.org/\r\n\r\nThere
    you can find some letterpress printers ans their adds.\r\nIf you are from Europe,
    I'ld recommand: www.druckerey.de\r\nMartin Z. Schroeder is a fine letterpress
    printer. Have a\r\nlook into his photos with references:\r\nhttp://www.druckerey.de/02angebot.html\r\n\r\nYes
    2 up to 3 weeks is realistic. No, sorry, correction:\r\nits fast. Its another
    time dimension, not comparable with\r\nMac's World. Lots of steps of working includes
    manual human\r\nressources and its not just a click on your mouse pad. \r\nDifficult
    to understand for a digital designer, but believe\r\nme: its just another dimension,
    not a question of \"faster\"\r\nor \"slower\", or more or less hectic. Yes, difficult
    to\r\nunderstand. For now I have to leave. Since yesterday morning\r\nI am printing
    new charater sets. And 'til now just 30 out\r\nof 40 are ready... - ...yes, difficult
    to understand...\r\ndifficult... (disapearing into my letterpress dimension...)\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch
