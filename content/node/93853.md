  body: "Hard to say on such a small sample... I risk [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sabon/|Sabon]],
    using some Old Styles Figures for numerals, mainly because of the four upper terminals
    /W and even if there's some [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/garamond|Garamond]]
    which look close.\r\n\r\nEdit: if they're actually using the same typeface on
    their [[http://artandcommerceproduction.com/|website]], this could well be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/garamond/|Garamond
    Pro]] (or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/garamond-premier/|Garamond Premier]])"
