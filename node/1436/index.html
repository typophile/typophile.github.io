		<div class="commentbody">Ian, I think you're trying to get at something  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more tangible, like when type goes beyond visual  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->communication to function as something else  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->entirely. In your example, type must provide grip  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on a man-hole cover.

		<div class="commentbody">hopefully this post isn't too confusing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->when i considered functional type to meaning, i equated it with its form. lets say i were to copy the aesthetic of a postal systems stamp {that stamp the postal office puts on a the stamp that you put on an envelope} and change the words of that system stamp to something that really didn't relate to its form. if i was a person that takes visuals for granted, perhaps I'd look at that circular mark and understand through its form that its gone through the mail system. if that's the case than its functional to me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->w/ all that said though, i think that if a letter that a sign maker has produced works for support for a bird as a home for its nesting materials then whom i'm a to disagree w/ its function? i hadn't considered that materlal aspect as much as i will now which is very cool in that if the original question hadn't been asked i would be no further ahead.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks a million everyone. The suggestions are great! You've really filled my head with tons of ideas. I love the alphabet soup. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm looking at this from an Irish perspective naturaly because I live in Ireland. The reason I want to write articles like this is because in Ireland there is a serious lack of interest in typography, something I want to address. We have never been famous for our designs, unlike the Netherlands, and I think it boils down to people becoming too safe in their offices sitting in front of their computers. I want them to read about design and not be overwhelmed by the technicalities (such as ledding and EMs). I would like them to perhaps look at design from a slighty different angle than they normally would. It would pleasure me to think that someone on the bus would go &quot;hey thats what that guy was on about&quot; as they drove past an aspect of design after reading one of my articles. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So here I go on my merry quest&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->=)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">why yes supreme knower of all, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it did for me at least when I realized I had to lay out a magazine in Ethiopic and was informed of the new fonts they've just released for communication&hellip;.before it was either that or scanning the articles or english. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here's some background from: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.ethiopic.com/index2.htm">http://www.ethiopic.com/index2.htm</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ethiopic or Geez is one of the oldest alphabets and has been in use in Ethiopia for more than 3,000 years. Until we computerized Ethiopic, the alphabet was printed manually or in the printing presses. Starting in 1982 we have taken the beautiful Ethiopic through DOS (ModEth, 1988) and Windows 3.0, 3.1 and 95. We have continued to develop applications for communicating with Ethiopic scripts via e-mail and the Internet since 1994. Our Ethiopic scripts contain the 480+ characters and require a maximum of two keystrokes to type each character. Our clients have started enjoying Ethiopic HTML (and HDML) on the information superhighway. Our sites are under continuous construction and the pages will have many language alphabets. Currently most of our Ethiopic web pages are in English and Amharic (Aírµ) languages. We expect to see documents in many of the languages of this historic African region in the near future. As of January 1997, Ethiopia has obtained limited access to the Internet and this has enabled Ethiopians to see our multi-lingual site for the first time. However, the use of Ethionet requires prior publication of Ethiopic documents using our software.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These pages are also dedicated to Ethiopic and the technology we have been developing and standardizing for it. You will find some free software or links to software for use with Geez documents. We will have many links to Ethiopic and Ethiopia related references, news, lessons, products, advertisements, organizations, entertainment, etc. in Amharic and English. This is the multi-lingual Ethiopic information superhighway at its infancy.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our products are protected through pending patent, copyright, trade secrets, etc. We have also submitted patent application to the Ethiopian government though there was no patent protection in Ethiopia. (In spite of these, our fears have come true by the proliferation of copycats to plagiarize our products. Beware of copycats who would try to peddle incomplete character sets and macros as Ethiopic software. None of the copycats can type the Ethiopic characters using two keystrokes or less per character or post Ethiopic documents on the Internet. Click here to read about our concern and elaboration on this topic.) Click here for the Amharic version of this introduction.</div>
