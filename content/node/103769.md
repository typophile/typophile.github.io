    \ <a href=\"\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/vietnam.html \">Vietnamese</a> page. I
    never cease to be amazed at Luc's productivity in creating and maintaining a large
    number of pages on the font scene around the world.\r\nHopefully one of our typophiles
    will suggest a font with Vietnamese diacritics that resembles the lettering in
    the picture.\r\nDon"
