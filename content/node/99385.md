body: "Hello,\r\nI am new to this forum and have a font I am having trouble locating.
  I used this font about 5 years ago when I built a website but the computer I used
  to build the site crashed about 1 year ago taking all of my fonts with it. I appreciate
  any help you can give me in finding the name of this font as I am getting ready
  to rebuild the site. I have searched countless font sites in attempting to identify
  it with no luck and the people I am working for do not know the name of the font
  either.\r\nWith much gratitude,\r\nCygnus Valerie[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontSample_4350.jpg]"
