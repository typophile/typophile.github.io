  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Well you learn something <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/cronos.html">new</a> every day.  <BR> <BR>To me, Cronos looks substantially different to Today Sans, unmistakably a Slimbach design (check out the lower counter of the 'g', similar to his Garamond, Warnock and Minion). The angled brushed-like ends of strokes, stronger modulation of stroke width, and abscence of annoying ink traps make Cronos the superior of the two in my book, and set it far enough apart to clear it of the above-linked charges.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Cronos is different enough to make it too small of a fish to fry - there are some narwhals out there. But it does have some telltale signs of  <i>structural</i> plagiarism, and it would have been nice if they would just give due credit. That's all. <BR> <BR>&gt; annoying ink traps <BR> <BR>TodaySans's ink traps are pretty subtle, and this benefits any text face. Looking at a text face at 200 pt is something a <i>reader</i> would never do. Don't believe those who say traps are unnecessary. All the <i>really</i> good designers use them (when needed). Not using them might be economically smart for certain markets (in the same way I think making smallcaps is largely pointless for most users, economically), but never technically so. <BR> <BR>&gt; superior <BR> <BR>I think in a vacuum Cronos could be seen as superior. Certainly its MM axes make (or used to make) it more versatile. But it is also less pure, and less original - less culturally significant. Which is what people remember. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was browsing at a magazine store yesterday, and I saw Cronos used in Mac Design as a text face. The display face is Trebuchet&hellip; Cronos reads really well as a text face, owing to its 'humanist' characteristics (!). Cronos is also used for the brochure the publishing courses at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. <BR> <BR>Cronos does work quite well with other Simbach's types. For my slab-serif paper I used Warnock with it. I got the Type Classics for Learning pack while I was still a student. It's terribly good value for some excellent types. A great way for a student to start up a really useful type library. <BR> <BR>Never thought Todays Sans was the source for Cronos, but now that you've mentioned it, I do see the similarities. Hrant: just how does one measure the 'cultural significance' of a typeface? I think it would probably take years for any type to become 'culturally significant'&hellip; Cronos is still pretty young. So Todays Sans is culturally significant you say? Didn't realize that&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>But I would say that innovation is the main ingredient&hellip;</i> <BR> <BR>That's a Romantic view of culture. Without denying the role and importance of innovation, and the kind of individual genius that usually produces it, a Classical view would reject the idea that such innovation is the main ingredient. Rather the aggregate of human activity defines culture, and the most important element is not innovation but tradition, not individual genius but collective engagement (civitas). As Ezra Pound said, in a rare moment of lucidity, 'Civilisation is not a one man job'. <BR> <BR>I don't think it is possible to describe a typeface as 'culturally significant' if no one is using it. And, yes, this does mean that Arial is a culturally significant typeface, proving that not all culture is good culture and that culture can exist because of commercial or technological accident rather than creative inspiration.</div>

But there is more than one ethical issue here.  <BR> <BR>One is the question you consider: proper acknowledgement of inspiration for your work. When and where should you do this? I think it should be done, but if it has been, then repeating it in advertising material it seems to me is asking too much. <BR> <BR>The other ethical issue is: when it is legitimate to disparage another person's character? This is regarded as a grave sin in both Buddhist and Rabbinic ethics, even when what you are saying is true. In Rabbinic ethics, it is especially a problem when a person's professional reputation is being potentially stained. There are, however, occassions on which a compelling reason overrides this prohibition, such as that another person will be cheated if you don't speak, or a serious injustice will be perpetuated.  <BR> <BR>Ethically, people are really in a different category than typefaces when it comes to criticism.</div>

Little like Zapf in some aspects, but in different results. I see more influence from Zapf and Schneider and others master calligrapher in Slimbach typefaces than anything else.

		<div class="commentbody">To my amateur typofile eyes, the italic of Cronos in the posted sample has a quite different structure than Today Sans. The roman is similar, but for example the bent tops of the 'r' and 'n' stems is also in Meta, which I think is earlier than TodaySans.   <BR> <BR>The larger question here is this. R.G. Collingwood, in his book 'What is Art?' points out that the periods when the greatest work has been done, such as Shakespear in literature or the Renaissance in visual arts, the people took from each other pretty freely. The community is helping even the best people to be better. At the same time, people do need to get credit and earn money for what they have produced. How do you serve both these goals?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">BTW, John, I still think it's important to see the text of the Cronos patent. I find it strange that -after failing to give public credit to satisfy its peers- Adobe would boldy reveal to the patent office an &quot;inspiration&quot; which is admittedly of subtle distinction, since the patent boys probably have trouble telling apart Times and Baskerville. <BR> <BR>But if it's true, that's wonderful - let's see it in the open to silence the few of us whose main objection is the denial (as opposed to the action itself). <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, let set up a rule (perhaps a game in fact): For each new typeface, list ALL influences (including thoses you suppose others will imagine too as influence) you can have on the specimen showing. And ask to put it at the end of the publisher catalog too. At the end theses lists will take more space than the fonts showing themselves. <BR> <BR>And some people will start a new topic on typophile.com and discussing why all typefaces showing are nowadays so small in catalogs and start to complain about them, for whatever reasons. <BR> <BR>More later, couple of years after, some old guys (the same who have very very long list of influence) will tell young guys why all theses small showing started to became more and more smaller. all of this came from a 2003 topic about how two different typefaces can be related each others. <BR> <BR>In same time, during some annual type conference, the type designers with the most long list of influencers will be honored by a prize (given only every three years), perhaps called &quot;Cronos prize&quot; in memory of the good old days of catalogs with big typeface showing perhaps? <BR> <BR>In reality this is not funny at all. <BR>So, my new problem is why Comic Sans is so influence by Souvenir? I hope to have a good pdf comparison ready for next 1st april 2004. <BR> <BR>Bonne nuit.</div>

And how is the reference to Today-Sans different than the one to Gill? Certainly no mentally stable type designer would pretend Cronos is too close to Gill for comfort. It seems like a sick joke to even mention Today-Sans in there&hellip; Or maybe they needed to mention the closest design to it out there, so that in the future nobody could bring that up to invalidate the patent? I guess that's what happens when a patent officer has an average of 90 minutes to approve a patent (and his outfit makes more money by approving a patent than not). Not that they have the necessary typographic insight anyway&hellip; BTW, what does &quot;ornamental design&quot; mean?! Lastly, what exactly happens 14 years after 1997/8? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
