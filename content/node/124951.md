body: "Thanks for giving this thread a look.\r\n\r\nSo here is my difficulty, though
  I am somewhat familiar with graphics design programs like gimp, photoshop, inkscape,
  etc. I am having trouble converting my creations into a 10x10 pixel font file format.\r\n\r\nI
  am completely new to this field.\r\n\r\nI found this site http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/\r\n\r\n...which
  seems to have the basic design concept simplified enough, but it doesn't look like
  the end product will be monospace.\r\n\r\nI tried using font forge and made some
  progress with it, but I don't understand most of it. It seems if I adjust the \"bitmap
  strikes\" whatever they are I can create something like what I am looking for, but
  I am still not sure how to make something of uniform width and height and the numbers
  I put in don't seem to match up or make sense to me. For example putting in 10 gives
  me a grid that is 8 tall and 10 wide? I don't quite understand. The terminus.fon
  file displays in the application I am using in a clean 16x8 pixels (or so the application
  claims), but loads on font forge on an 11x8 grid but set to 14 pixels in bitmap
  strikes? These numbers don't seem to add up.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows of a way (preferably
  free) to create what I am trying to do, I would very much appreciate that information.
  Or if you can create a font file and post it that would generate a 10x10 pixel font,
  that would be even better! I am pretty desperate to put my designs into a usable
  format. My ocd can't stand rectangles over squares!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    src=\"http://666kb.com/i/cy5gp8lf5j7l980b4.png\" title=\"hosted by 666kb.com\"/>\r\n\r\nFontforge
    gives the glyphs a height of 10px and a width of 10px. The height is divided into
    an upper part (which lies above the baseline) of 8px and a lower part (which lies
    below the baseline) of 2px. To change this ratio (800:200 by default), go to \"Element\"
    > \"Font Info\" > \"General\" and modify the \"Ascender\" and \"Descender\" values.\r\n\r\nTo
    change the width of the glyphs, select all glyphs in the overview window, go to
    \"Metric\" > \"Set Width\", and choose the width you want.  The font will be monospace
    if you simply make all glyphs the same width."

  body: "Thank you all so much for your help! The project I'm working on has moved
    forward by leaps and bounds with your help, but I've hit some more very frustrating
    snags...\r\n\r\nIt seems the last font I created/saved doesn't work at all and
    loaded as either some other default font or not at all. Something to do with it's
    size? I'm struggling to figure this stuff out.\r\n\r\nI tried using Fontstruct
    and experienced some success, but by the time I had finished somehow the font
    was no longer 10x10. I think it was reading it as something much bigger that what
    it really was, possibly? So I am about to beat my head against a wall... I wish
    I could invite one of you to look over my shoulder while I did this... I'm going
    nuts!\r\n\r\nThis is the font I am trying to create... nothing special, just a
    dirty ascii font for my own purposes.... But I can't get it to work.\r\nhttp://s27.postimg.org/wnkaglbup/Rogue.png\r\n\r\nI
    am just venting at the moment. I've been working on this thing for 16 hours now...\r\n\r\nAnyone
    know of a 10x10 font that I could use as a basis? Can post a link to an example
    10x10 .fon or .ttf with the requested deminsions? It would be amazing! I've done
    some google searches but the fonts that come up for me don't seem usable or the
    right deminsions. Thanks in advance for any advice or support! It is much appreciated!"

    do you generate? With what operating system and program do you intend to use the
    font?\r\n\r\nI am not sure about Windows and MacOS, but in Linux, the most convenient
    bitmap font format nowadays is TTF. Choose \"File\" > \"Generate Fonts\" to create
    the font file. Choose \"No outline font\" as the outline format and \"(faked)
    MS bitmap only sfnt (ttf)\" as the bitmap format. This will create a TTF file
    that has no outlines but has the bitmap glyphs included.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://666kb.com/i/cy5ot2wz817otq9md.png\"
