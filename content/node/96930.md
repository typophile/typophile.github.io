  for my organisation. It's not officially been rolled out yet, but I want to be ahead
  of the game and see if I can start incorporating it in my work.\r\n\r\nI've had
  a look online and it's similar to Gotham, Avenir, Bryant and Corbel....but not quite.\r\n\r\nI've
  tried the online Font ID tools available but the one it came back with is District
  Thin...which isn't it either.\r\n\r\nAny ideas ?\r\n"
