    other help, you can try this font for similar fonts - \r\n\r\nhttp://www.sudtipos.com\r\n\r\nselect
    the Bluemlein Script collection on the right of the page and there are some great
    script fonts there.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "that picture isn't clear enough to tell the colouring, but if you can see
    it, then it can surely be done in photoshop.\r\n\r\nGoing from 1 colour |----------------------|
    to another is called a 'gradient' or a colour gradation and is easily done in
    Photoshop and the GIMP (a free bitmap graphics editor)\r\n\r\nIf the colours are
    more than just one colour to another it's still very easy to do, and possible,
    but you'll likely have to learn how to use Photoshop or something like that first
    and get used to how it works."

  body: "Boy. Talk about a photo finish. I'm a lettering artist and type designer
    and to be quite honest... I could go either way - type or hand lettering. The
    lighting of the scan has blurred many of the clues as well as heavied up one side
    further confusing things. I would lean towards hand, 51%...  type, 49%. How is
    that for confidence?\r\n\r\nMichael."

    I was concentrating too hard on the duplication of the e's and s's. The blurring
    really messes with the weights. No excuse, bad Michael!\r\n\r\nMichael"
