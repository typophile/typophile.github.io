body: Hello. <BR> <BR>I have a typeface on my system that is called Enschede. I need
  to direct a client to where they can buy it, but I am starting to think that the
  font in question maybe named wrong as I cannot seem to find it anywhere. <BR> <BR>Any
  help? <BR> <BR>Thanks<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42396.jpg"

  body: If the font is on your system then you may have some luck examining it yourself.  <BR>
    <BR>If you are on a Windows PC, find the font in the fonts folder &#40;in Control
    Panels&#41; and double click on it. A window will appear that gives information
    on the font, and, if the font is well made, you will probably find where its from
    there.  <BR> <BR>See below for an example. I have highlighted in orange the appropriate
    place to look. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42399.gif"

  body: Under MacOS X 10.2, select the font file and press Apple and I keys together
    to get the following information panel. Again, the Copyright notice can remind
    you of the foundry / source. <BR> <BR>You can do this in FontBook under XX 10.3.
    However, since I inadvertently snapped the screen off my g4 powerbook, I can&#39;t
    show you that one. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42402.gif"

  body: I&#39;m not finding any links for &#34;B&amp;P Graphics&#34;. Is this an active
    company? And is it one that developed original fonts, or is this font likely to
    have another name &#40;an original, or <i>real</i> name, in other words&#41;?

    &#40;possibly from the seventies or eighties&#41;, but I can&#39;t place it.

    them. Worst of all, they cost US$19.95 a pop for inferior quality  <BR>copies!
    The nerve...

    name &#34;Toledo&#34; though. I&#39;ve never seen that in digital format before.

    lighter weights</a> that I haven&#39;t seen before &#40;regular, demibold, and
    light&#41;. <BR> <BR>Also on that page they have Tabasco -- is that digitized
    anywhere else? <BR> <BR>And, under their &#34;Designer Collection&#34;... is that
    the lost lighter weight of Blippo, masquerading as &#34;Graphics&#34;? <BR> <BR>Still
    waiting for someone to digitize Yagi Double with all the alternates... =&#41;
