    the cheapest one, or the one with the largest family if you need it for a big
    job."

  body: "Its serifs get a bit thin at body text size.\r\nI've combined Bauer Bodoni
    for heads and decks, with Berthold Bodoni for text.\r\nTimes Roman is a good text
    face to pair with it. Lots of sparkle."

    Serie BQ</a> due to its SC & OSF. But it ain\u2019t cheep."
