body: "Does iPad make any use of font hinting, if available, please? I mean not just
  safari browser, but the device itself, e.g. in purchased apps.\r\n\r\nAs far as
  I know, the CoreText rendering engine on Mac OS X completely ignores font hinting
  and rather employs subpixel antialiasing (source: http://www.typotheque.com/articles/hinting).\r\n\r\nHowever,
  iOS devices do not use subpixel antialiasing (probably due to portrait/landscape
  orientation switching) and do only standard \"grayscale\" antialiasing, which obviously
  leads to less precise results. So I am wondering whether or not do they make any
  use of font hinting (to compensate this)?\r\n\r\nThe reason why I'm asking is we
  want to embed Neue Helvetica in an iPad app we are developing now (the Neue Helvetica
  included in iOS does not have Latin Extended-A charset, unfortunately). And we are
  wondering whether we should invest in the hinted version offered by Linotype, labelled
  as XSF (more about it here http://www.linotype.com/2049-16432/xsf.html)\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas, please?\r\n\r\nThank you very much."

    And all the browsers on the iPad behave the same, so a whole multitude of other

    Probably yours is not mine and yours may be confusing to most people trying to

    lingo. What matters to authors is the result, not what the font creator needs
    to do to get that result. \r\nSomething somewhere has to map the outline to pixels.
    Based on the outline, a pixel outerform is created onscreen. In Windows GDI and
    DirectWrite, this outerform is influenced by instructions inside the font. On
    the Mac, it isn't. It creates the outerform on the fly. How on earth is this essentially
    different from autohinting on the fly?\r\nIf your point is that my statement might
    lead someone to think that the Mac does exactly the same thing as GDI or DirectWrite
    but does it automatically, point taken.\r\nBut other than that, are we unconfused?\r\n\r\nBut

    me that what is missing from some of the analysis of rendering variables in the
    webfont market is the recognition that <em>it is still with the machines where
    money is to be made,</em> and where competition takes place in the area of real
    or perceived quality, and hence in the area of rendering. In the period of greatest
    predictability in text rendering, i.e. the initial years of TrueType, there was
    essentially only one machine, manufactured by various companies from largely interchangeable
    components; machine differences in device resolution and gamma had minimal impact
    on what one could expect from the behaviour of a given TTF. But that is very obviously
    no longer the case. Now there are lots of machines, and there is once again value
    to companies in trying to compete in terms of real or perceived quality of output,
    or 'user experience' as it is now reckoned, including in the area of text rendering.\r\n\r\nThis
    competition comes with a massive support cost, of course, but it is one that the
    machine makers have successfully shifted onto the publishers, i.e. the cost of
    trying to target multiple devices with different rendering environments. So, David
    asks: \u2018...how long can the multifacted browser/device intersection last more
    costly than print?\u2019 And I suspect the answer is that it will last for as
    long as there is more money to be made from making and selling a machine than
    there is to be made from either publishing content to be read on it or making
    fonts to display that content."

    this case the machine doesn't need to be hardware\u2014it could be software or
    a service. For example, Google does not sell much hardware, but subsidizes creation
    of fonts so that web developers will link to fonts on Google servers and supply
    Google with tracking data for sites that aren't using Google Analytics. Of course,
    even Google isn't willing to pay for creating great screen fonts, so they're taking
    advantage of designers with a penchant for open-source software.\r\n\r\n<cite>I.E.

    I had originally referred to physical machines and virtual machines in my post,
    but removed this sentence as I thought the analysis was already getting too complicated.
    The point is that the bulk of money to be made is neither in the typefaces nor
    in the content set with the typefaces. Which puts the makers of type and the makers
    of content largely at the mercy of the competitive strategies of the hardware/software
    makers, who are playing for the really big stakes.\r\n\r\nDavid: <em>...the astonishing
    statistics showing that north of 95% of the money made on the web is made by south
    of 5% of web developers.</em>\r\n\r\nWell, that's better than the overall distribution
    of wealth in the capitalist system.\r\n\r\nThe interesting analysis would look
    how closely that 5% of web developers is tied to hardware/software developers.
    I don't think the disparity can be explained in terms of \u2018the cost of trying
    to target multiple devices with different rendering environments is way too high
    for most all benefits\u2019. This disparity has developed in a market in which
    everyone was using Verdana regardless of rendering environment. Web fonts are
    too new a phenomenon for their cost factor to in any way account for the failure
    of most web developers to make more than a pittance."

    \r\n\r\nThat link is a list of parts and $10 for manufacturing that add up to
    3/5ths the cost of the device. In most retail electronics, the retailer needs
    2/5ths the cost of the product. \r\n\r\nSo on one end of the Apple chain, (your

    outlets with total responsibility for complete costs of integration in between.
    \r\n\r\nJust the parts and normal retail demands add up to 5/5ths of the sale
