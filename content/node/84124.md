  body: "Personally I think that, if you use crude geometric forms, you should stick
    to them, and see how to get the forms more refined. You have used ovals as well,
    and I think this does not give a good effect, it looks somehow \"amateurish\"
    in letters like [m] or [n].\r\nI also think such strongly \"constructed\" alphabets,
    if accompanied by a \"cursive\" variant should have it built with a different
    logic, not by slanting the upright original alphabet."

  body: "kentlew \u2013\u2013 Sorry, this is my first ever post on Typophile, I have
    tried, several times, to get my uploaded attachments listed, with no success.
    So I've been typing the links in the post's description as I'd like them to be
    visible as early in the post as possible. Sorry if this caused any trouble.\r\n\r\npicic
    -- I think I understand what you mean (that the curves of those particular letters
    should start immediately from the baseline, rather going straight up then curving
    around) is that right? If this is the case you're making, firstly it's an interesting
    idea, except I can't see how I could go about doing that without either making
    them shorter than the x-height or having them go up to x-height but made a lot
    wider. For instance the 'n' would just be the top half of the 'O', whereas the
    'm' would be two top halves of the 'O' joined together, thereby creating two obscenely
    wide lowercase letters. I could imagine the same thing happening with the 'h',
    'U', 'u' and 'y'. And if you were to put those next to a much narrower letter,
    I can't imagine it looking anything but bizarre."

  body: "If I get right what you are saying: it all depends on how much circles of
    different diameter you are prone to use.\r\n\r\nEven if you wish to keep it monotonal
    in line weight, I would suggest adding some modulation, in some way.\r\n\r\nI
    found the lack of modulation too restrictive, it\u2019s more or less the same
    questions which are posed every time, since Renner tried to keep Futura as monolinear
    as possible."

  body: I'll have to think about doing that, as it certainly sounds interesting, but
    the initial inspiration for this typeface was for it to kept as simple as possible
    without compromising on legibility, as the simpler designs are often the most
    beautiful. Either way, if I don't incorporate this little bit of advice of yours
    into this design, I'll definitely consider it for future typefaces.
