  ID Pop Quiz, possibly -- but not necessarily -- providing a hint.</li>\r\n<li>Try
  to identify the typeface. To win, you need to <strong>e-mail me both the correct

  participate.</strong></i>\r\n<li>Show off your knowledge by casually mentioning
  additional trivia, like who designed it, when and by whom was it (first) published,
  and other cool stuff to impress your fellow Typophiles with.</li>\r\n<li>Every week
  a new challenge will be posted.</li></ul>\r\nIn case of any disputes, I will act
  as judge, jury and avenging angel of wrath.\r\n\r\nIf you think this is too easy,
  maybe try the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/intermediate_level\">Intermediary Level
  Type ID Pop Quiz</a> or <a href=\"http://typophile.com/expert_level\">Expert Level
  Type ID Pop Quiz</a>.\r\n\r\nGood luck everyone, and have fun. ;^)\r\n\r\n<em>With

    (you've got the font, you've seen it a lot and previously identified it, etc.),
    but using the tools at identifont.com and myfonts.com will make life easier. Other
    helpful sites are TypeNavigator at FontShop, Font Finder at linotype.com, and
    the extended question set at Fonts.com.  \r\n\r\nAnd then there's just looking
    at a lot of fonts.  ;-)"

    ;^) Here's what Mili had to say:\r\n<em>\"Stephen Coles' birthday wishes were
    written with Fling and alternatives.\r\nLinotype has this information:\r\nFling
    was designed by Michael Gills in 1995.  This richly ornamented typeface is based
    on the basic forms of the well-mannered scripts of the late 19th century.  Intricate
    and generous capitals contrast with reserved, almost simple lower case letters
    and the upright figures give Fling a sophisticated, elegant look.  The capitals
    can also be used as initials and the many ligatures and alternative letter forms
    offer a variety of design possibilities.\"</em>\r\n\r\nJust when you thought it'd
