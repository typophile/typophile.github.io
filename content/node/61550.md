  'religion and science'. I chose a font that i thought looked faith-like and one
  that looked science-like. What do you guys think?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/faith_4831.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso,
  do you guys think something like this is too creepy to put in a portfolio. I was
  thinking employers might think its too scary. Should I try to create things that
  would fit the 'norm' ? Thanks."

    goes, i really wouldnt want an employer who would get creeped out by this. i mean,
    its not even offensive or anything.. it just delas with a sensitive topic, but
    does that mean sensitive topics shouldnt be dealt with at all?\r\n "

    from the distortian of crusifix but i don't think that should stop you putting
    it into your portfolio.\r\n\r\nOn a purely aesthetic point, which may come way
    to late in your design process, have you tried loosing the dolll and the speckly
    background. It is a good visual concept that seems to loose impact through having
    so many visual elements.\r\n\r\nType wise i would agree with crossbones abut formulas
    needing a new typeface. Have you tried having the faith/formular contrast being
    a serif/sans-serif contrast?\r\n\r\nAlso your hierachy seems a little off; 'no
    cover' stands out way more than 'art show' and the time stands out more than the
    date, both of which seem the wrong way round to me.\r\n\r\nHope some of this is
    useful.\r\nWill"

  body: "I hope you don't mind a few more thoughts.\r\nFirst i think it is deffinately
    a step forward.\r\nIs there a reason you have now gone for an inverted crusifix?
    Is it specifically a satanic vibe you want from it?\r\nThough i really like the
    idea of the visual it is starting to look a little raggedy round the edges - have
    you tried mocking it up and photographing it yourself?\r\nThe overall much layout
    is better but i am not a fan of the comic book speach bubble - maybe try and intergrate
    the description into the rest of the layout.\r\nYou might also want to tweak the
    'faith & formulas' a bit more, they seem more seperate then in contrast.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck.\r\n\r\nWill"

  body: "For what it's worth, the graphic doesn't say to me \"art inspired by science
    and religion\" so much as \"art inspired by science and contempt for religion\".
    \ It's very sacrilegious.  I guess if that captures the essence of the show, then
    it's doing its job.\r\n\r\nI'm not crazy about the way \"Formulas\" is set in
    the second version.  In science and math publications, formulas are generally
    set in an italic serif; you might see if, say, Palatino Italic or Minion Pro Italic
    calls to mind the feel of a science text.\r\n\r\nI like the speech bubble.  Can't
    say that I like the graphic, but aside from the subject matter, I think the heavy
    black line around it in the second version is distracting.  Maybe you could make
    it thinner and/or lighter."
