    here on the Type ID Board, and this is one of them. Lineto designs are usually
    very forward-thinking, but the context they are used in is <em>so</em> very safe
    and boring these days, which effectively diminishes their worth in my opinion.
    It's the 'white tiger' syndrome -- instead of being creative and trying to break
    the mould, many designers think that using the cool typeface all the other cool
    designers use is sufficient to make their work interesting. Not."

    a so called typophile. Regardless of how often they have been used, the 2 faces'
    I mentioned Helvetica and Avant Garde, are undeniably brilliant typefaces and
    if the circumstances suit there's no reason why these faces can't still be used
    to create outstanding design. The same applies to Lineto faces.\r\n\r\nDesigners
    should be allowed to make there own decisions instead of consigning certain typefaces

  body: "I understand both Naoise's and Bald's point and I can appreciate that Bald
    my not be that serious about avoiding Helvetica, while he probably is about Avant
    Garde. \r\n\r\nI think Avant Garde is sometimes overused by people with an untrained
    eye but every once in a while I think people really can do great stuff with it.
    I think one of the best examples of how <em>and</em> how not to use Avant Garde
    is Grafik. I personally love the Grafik logo, but using Avant Garde as your body
    text is just painful, I really feel it takes away from the magazine.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avant_garde_logo_5185.jpg]\r\n\r\nAs
    for Helvetica, I rarely like to bad mouth one of my favourite typefaces, Although
    you wouldn't find it in much of my work. This is probably due to the stigma that
    surrounds the typeface. As for a use of one particular typeface It's more important
    to examine the design and see if there was an appropriate choice made in regards
    to the content.\r\n\r\nLike all other design disciplines in the end the choice
    of a design element can often come down to a fashion trend. Which may in this
    case be Helvetica, Avant Garde or a lineto typeface. But soon enough what was
    once fashionable to the highend designers will overtime make its way down to the
    lay person designing a flyer to a small gig! \r\n\r\nThere are many designers
    using both Helvetica and Avant Garde and I personally feel using them well. [[http://www.wearebuild.com|Build]],[[http://www.effektivedesign.co.uk|Effektive]],[[http://www.madethought.com|Madethought]],[[http://www.un.titled.co.uk|Un.titled]]
    for example.\r\n\r\nThese designers don't have to resort to alternatives to produce
    stunning original work.\r\n\r\np.s may we start a new thread?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Before we close off this discussion, I'd just like to say that I don't particularly
    like people second-guessing me. So to make everything clear and avoid any more
    misunderstandings:\r\n\r\nI <em>was</em> serious about avoiding Helvetica and
    ITC Avant Garde Gothic. This is a personal statement, and I am <em>not</em> telling
    anyone else what to do or not do. Usually it's designers suffering from tunnel
    vision like Massimo Vignelli and his followers that go about trying to convince
    everyone to do it their way (re: his (in)famous five typefaces credo).\r\n\r\nSo
    on a personal level, all I can say is that I will <em>never</em> use Helvetica
    or ITC Avant Garde Gothic <em>unless I have a very very good reason to do so.</em>
    That is because, yes, I <em>am</em> a Typophile, Naoise. I think I know enough
    about type to not be starstruck by the perennial \"classic\" fonts and make well-informed
    choices about which typefaces to choose for specific jobs. When you say they are
    \"undeniably brilliant typefaces\" and \"the alternatives rarely live up to the
    original\", that is your <em>personal</em> opinion, <em>not</em> a scientific
    fact. I personally find that Helvetica often falls short due to the problems in
    its design and structure, which is why since its rise in popularity many talented
    type designers have designed alternatives which deal with these shortcomings.\r\n\r\nNever
    <em>ever</em> again assume that I am \"a so-called Typophile\" just because I
    have a different opinion than yours. Please let's not resort to that kind of fundamentalism
    and respect each other's choices in an open dialogue.\r\n\r\nPeace."
