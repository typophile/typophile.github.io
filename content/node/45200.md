  body: "It's by Hendrik Werkman, a Dutch designer working in Groningen, Holland pre
    WWII. He was an interesting guy who, late in his life, began doing very experimental
    and artistic work using a letterpress. This image was part of a periodical he
    published called the *Next Call.* He was killed by the Nazis when Allied forces
    invaded Holland. \r\n\r\nYou should look for more of his work, it's really phenomenal.\r\n\r\nGeorge
    \r\nI felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no Bodoni"
