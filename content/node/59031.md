  knew the answer to this question: why do books have their title at the top of the
  (often verso) page?\r\n\r\nA modern justification might be for photocopying or faxing
  so the page can be taken out of context, but they were putting the running title
  of the book at the head of pages centuries before anyone even dreamt of a fax machine.\r\n\r\nAny
  clues?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The most basic reason I can think of is to help the reader find his or her
    place in a book, especially if the title is on the verso and the section or chapter
    name is on the recto. Another reason would be if a page gets separated from a
    book, to easily identify it.\r\n\r\nBut here's an article on running heads, by
    John D. Berry, which goes into a lot more detail: <a href=\"http://www.creativepro.com/article/dot-font-running-heads\">How
    to deal with those little scraps of text on a page that tell us what document
    we're reading, and where we are in it.</a>\r\n\r\nWhy at the top? Berry writes,
    \"There's a practical advantage to keeping both the running head and the page
    number at the top of the page. If the text may end at different points on different
    pages, or if you might need to add a line or cut a line at the bottom of the page
    to avoid a widow, then a running foot would draw attention to these variations;
    a running head would not.\""

  body: If I recall some of my earlier Dicken's books, the title was not always in
    the header. In those cases, text that referred to the content of the page appeared
    in the headers, describing the action on the page.

  body: "The John Berry article noted above pretty much says it all. That's a good
    place to start.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that each book's needs have to be considered;
    there's no one-size fits-all way to handle running heads. I'm looking at a recent
    book done here. On the verso we placed the part-title rather than the chapter
    title. No folio on the verso. On the recto, only the folio. Why? I'm not sure.
    Probably as Berry remarked: sometimes we just do these kinds of things to running
    heads for something \"different\" or \"noticeable,\" to prove we are designers.\r\n\r\nThe
    content of running heads is primarily an editorial decision, rarely a design decision.
    When an editor hands over a manuscript for design, there should be a separate
    file with the contents for running heads. The appearance of running heads is primarily
    a design decision, often done in consultation with the editor.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "I didn't read the Berry article, so if I repeat, forgive me. But I think
    Will has it about right, it is an editorial prerogative.\r\n\r\nBTW, in journals,
    the article title is often on the verso, author on the recto.\r\n\r\nWhen done
    best, the running heads often mirror the contents page. There are books where
    the A-level subheads are listed in the contents. In such cases, the best running
    head structure would be chapter title on the verso, current A-head on the rightie.\r\n\r\nIf
    subheads aren't on the contents, but there are part titles (& they'd be on the
    contents page), then it would be part title on the verso, CT on the recto.\r\n\r\nThe
    contents page and running heads work best as a sort of mini-index, that is, helping
    the reader find what they are interested in in the book/journal. Seems to me a
    lot of contemporary editors forget this -- or I'm out-of-date again.\r\n\r\nRepeating
    the book title for 300 pages sort of implies you think the reader is too stupid
    to be reading the book anyway. But come to think on it, that's how a lot of editors
    seem to feel, so maybe it is appropriate.\r\n\r\nYMMV"

    do binding according to how much wealth you had, and the amount you wanted to
    spend. Samuel Pepys mentions this many times in his diary, as he was amassing
    his eventually large library.\r\n\r\nI suspect the very stingy book buyer might
    have several smaller books bound together to save costs. In such a case a tradition
    of putting the title on the running heads may have developed."

  body: True Bert. But the serialization was not normally in book sections, but in
    magazines of the day, where one episode of the Dickens tale would be a portion
    of the content of the magazine. Initially Dickens worked for other publishers,
    and eventually he published magazines in which his own works would appear. I doubt
    that the magazine sections would be suitable to binding, but never having seen
    any, I cannot attest to this.

    situation where you're at a desk or in a library with multiple volumes open. This
    would help you identify a given book without having to pick it up. You're also
    more likely to lay the top of one book on the bottom of another, to angle it toward
    you.

  body: "@ Chiba:\r\n\r\nIf you have decided to use only one folio per spread, you
    should just decide where you want that folio for design reasons. In a few pages
    readers will be accustomed to its placement, and when they need folios they'll
    find them with no problem. Don't make too much of a scientific quest out of this
    question.\r\n\r\nI have seen single-folio spreads with folios in just about every
    conceivable position. I doubt readers had trouble finding them. With the exception
    of the following:\r\n\r\nOne always wants to be wary of placing folios too close
    into the bind gutter. Depending on how the book is bound, you risk losing folios
    in the bind. & if the book is ever re-bound, good-bye folios.\r\n\r\npowers"
