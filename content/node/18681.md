  design institute and\r\nthis is what i've come up with at the moment. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HKDI.png]\r\n\r\nHavin
  a bit of trouble with the 'D' & 'I' cos they \r\ndon't take up the same amount of
  space as the 'H'&'K'.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be appreciated, cheers.\r\n\r\nI
  probably shouldn't be giving myself the added\r\ncompetition but the website is
  http://www.hkdilogo.edu.hk/\r\nshould anyone wish to enter it themselves.\r\n\r\nGraham"

    add serifs to the \"I\" to take up room.\r\n\r\nAs far as your logo overall, I
    think it lines up too much which makes it boring. Try making the icon and the
    \"design institute\" smaller. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hk23.gif]"

  body: I would also pursue other fonts for the name. Maybe fonts that are sharper.
    Try using small caps.

  body: "Thanks Tom, \r\nI've been staring at it for so long. It's good to get some
    other opinions. I'll give the serifs a try it's probably what i've been looking
    for.\r\n\r\nI'm wary of making the icon too small as i wanted the chinese characters
    to be on equal standing with the english, but i see what you mean about boring.\r\n\r\ndeadline's
    31st james, better get jigging...\r\ni've got a copy of the chinese characters
    if you need them at all?\r\n\r\nsee you guys in a bit with a reworking or few.\r\n\r\nGraham"

  body: "hey guys,\r\nwell, I also sent a few proposals for this competition, and
    I'd like to see what you all think about them.\r\nUnderneath each of them there's
    a link to a PDF file with an explanation of the concept behind each logo:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/proposal1.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.bluehaired.com/hkdi/1.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/proposal2.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.bluehaired.com/hkdi/2.pdf\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/proposal3.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.bluehaired.com/hkdi/3.pdf\r\n\r\nThe
    deadline is already gone so there's no chance of any changes now, but still I'd
    like to know your opinions... hopefully I have a chance for the 10,000 bucks at
    stake ;-)"
