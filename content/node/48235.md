body: "There is a <a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/more_bounce_for_bounce.php\">nice
  blog post</a> over at [[Under Consideration]], on the latest brand update for Bounce.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bounce_5130.png]\r\n\r\nMy
  opinion is that they got a little too gimmicky with the word mark, literally making
  the letters appear to bounce. The \"un\" ligature seems clever, but is poorly executed
  and I question the added dimension by hiding part of a letter \"o\" behind the \"e,\"
  creating a \"c.\" It still reads as an \"o\" and the more I look at it, the worse
  it seems to get.\r\n\r\nI can imagine the discussion with the executive stakeholders
  now, \"OMG, I love it! The letters are bouncing their way right into the dryer!\"
  \"The 's' shape the 'u' and the 'n' creates really makes me feel like I want to
  dry some clothes, IMMEDIATELY!\" \"Women across the country are going to just die
  for this logo. The dryer sheets will literally Bounce right into their shopping
  carts!\"\r\n \r\nI think they certainly headed in the right direction with the overall
  feeling the brand exihibits. It is bright, clean and still very recognizable as
  the same ole' dryer sheets that we know and love. I appreciate the expanded brand
  palette used in their packaging and think they should consider pushing these new
  colors across the brand, especially on the site, although the site is a whole discussion
  in itself because it is <a href=\"http://www.bouncesheets.com/en_US/index.jsp\">awfully
  dreadful</a> on many levels.\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone think? Discuss."

    some legibility on the \"ce\".\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it is in the normal garish nature
    of cleaning product packaging design."

  body: "I agree that the lettering could have been worked a bit more. Maybe some
    Omnes style could have given a softness to the letters. The contrast surrounding
    the word has been reduced, which really emphasizes the sky photography.\r\n\r\nI
    resort to the multi-dimensional outline style on packages and the halftone dot
    art. In this case a bit of the blue in the outline might have made the name pop
    a bit more on the shelf.\r\n\r\nThe photography and the incorporation of the vector
    masks to marry the photo with the rest of the package works well."

  body: "Looks like a mashup of tired ideas I\u2019ve already seen a million times,
    mostly in the stock illustration section of iStock. The circles gimmick has been
    old for a while, the same goes for the halftone trick; I can find both of them
    all over logo compilation books from the last few years. The wordmark is hackneyed
    and clever for the sake of being clever. The entire design will get dumped in
    a year or two when it gets to be painfully outdated and the old logo will be revived
    by someone who understands brand equity better than whoever did this one."
