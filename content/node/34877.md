  Egyptian, or Slab Serif that's light on the eye at smaller sizes and most importantly
  would compliment Delicious (at any weight) [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html]]
  - for reference]. It's proving quite difficult to find something that's condensed
  in the same way that delicious is...\r\n\r\nIdeally open sourced/creative commons
  - but I'll buy if I need to."
