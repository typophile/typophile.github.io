body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Brandon_4533.jpg]\r\nMy first thought when
  I saw this was that it was a modified Trajan Pro, but it definitely isn't as the
  serifs are different, the uppercase R is significantly different and there are a
  number of other subtle differences. Can anyone help me figure out what it is?"

  body: Thanks for your reply. I took a look at Life and I noticed that while it is
    similar, I don't think it's quite right. Most notably, Life has a serif on the
    top left of the uppercase N whereas this sample image does not. That was one of
    the things that made me think Trajan right away. There are also some other subtle
    differences if you look very closely.

    reasons it is difficult to ID is that it has been heavily manipulated\u2014as
    most logotypes are, if they aren\u2019t drawn from scratch.\r\n\r\nLife seemed
    the best overall match for proportion and serifs (before some were edited out)."

    it being Life. It's very difficult to say for certain.

  body: Thanks for the reply, Don. I completely agree that Life could be edited to
    make the logo. To me, though, some of the extremely minor differences seem like
    something no one would do. There's these really minute variations that I have
    trouble believing someone would spend their time mucking about with in the process
    of making this logo. And I'm the kind of guy that mucks about with minute details
    a lot! For example, look at the top left corner of the top counter in the uppercase
    B. On the sample it curves straight into the corner, while in Life it starts an
    ever so slight down curve before hitting the corner. Sure it could have been edited,
    but who's gonna spend the time to do that for a simple logo? I won't bother mentioning
    them all but there are several others. Those kinds of differences are just placing
    a seed of doubt in my mind. While I agree that Life is very close and may indeed
    be the original font, due to those differences I'm thinking it's a little more
    likely that the original font is something else, which we may never discover.
