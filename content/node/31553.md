  body: The "micrometer" comment got me. Fine, I get it, most people don't notice
    type, but that's exaggerating things too much. Not that I think that the differences
    between the Yes and No choices actually affected the number of votes.

    for no into a gun pointed at the voter.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
