  to give it a run though its paces is most welcome to do so. It would be a great
  help. <BR> <BR>I launched MT without enough feedback testing the last time, so this
  revision is an effort to fix the things that went wrong. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the
  latest draft of the PR I&#39;m preparing for the new launch. Anyone who has experience
  in writing press releases is welcome to critique it as well: <BR> <BR>Mean Tangerine
  announces a new, improved font-navigation design. Advantages over the previous design:
  consolidated font presentation, comparison shopping, extensive typeface previews,
  and one-click purchasing. <BR> <BR>Building on its initial launch of 82 pixel fonts,
  Mean Tangerine also proudly announces an additional 18 fonts to its library. That'
