  body: "<cite>I like the outlined better. I just wonder if there\u2019s any logic
    to the breaking of the letters?</cite>\r\n\r\nFirst I wanted to make some sort
    of autogram. I decided to take the whole name instead, and hook the letters onto
    each other. But then some characteristics would disappear: let say, the 't' for
    example, didn't function as a 't', could be an 'l' as well.\r\n\r\nBy deleting
    some pieces, that problem was resolved.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I wanted to keep the autogram
    idea, it must be a fluent integration of letters,  open and friendly.\r\n\r\n<cite>And
    how are you going to print it?</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, yeah, I still have to find
    out. ;-)"

  body: I think it loks strange, maybe you can work a  little more. Spaces are not
    equilibrated. The M creates a wide black hole, while between the A, T and E there's
    no space. To me looks strange

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mateo-suggestion_5881.jpg]\r\n\r\nHow
    about you do it this way? I think this has better balance compared to the original.
    It is still readable as \"mateo\" but looks more complex now. Does that reflect
    your friend's character - or is he not complex. Perhaps you should also try something
    that speaks about him. Just a suggestion :)"

  body: Denis, I can't read "mateo" in it at all anymore. It says "nateo" now to me.
    I know what you tried to do, and it was a good idea, but it doesn't work here
    :(

  body: I like denis' version, but it does read nateo. There's probably a way around
    that though. Ringo's version looks cool, and the colours are much easier on the
    eyes. The letters still seem off though.
