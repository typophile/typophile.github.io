body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a need for a single multilingual font including English,
  Bengali and Devanagari scripts. My development environment is Windows 7. I am using
  Type Tool 3.0 for Glyph editing and Microsoft Volt 1.3 for creating Open Type features.\r\n\r\nThe
  current state of the project is that I have managed to combine English and Bengali
  and all features seem to work perfectly in the Volt proofing tool but not so in
  in Windows MS Word 7 and In-design on Mac OS 10.7, though they are mostly working
  in these platforms. However in its present state it is not usable due to the following
  difficulties. Any help will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n<strong>General Difficulties
  (Windows + Mac In-Design)</strong>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Bengali Reph positioning is
  not working (OT 'abvm' feature)</li>\r\n<li>Bengali Terminal forms are not working
  (OT 'fina' feature)</li>\r\n<li>Punctuation marks such as hyphen/underscore/comma/semicolon
  etc. have different horizontal positions in English and Bengali. This cannot be
  implemented since the Bengali Kerning is not working (OT 'kern' feature)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<strong>Mac
  In-Design Difficulties</strong>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Below base mark positioning is
  not working (OT 'blwm' feature)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nSince the system would not
  let me attach the volt source file even after renaming as TXT, the best I could
  do was to provide screen shots.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nGaura\r\n "
