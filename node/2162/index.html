  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, new here but have just spent about an hour and a half looking through loads of threads, some of the ideas here are amazing! <BR>Anyway, I'm in the process of designing a portfolio site for myself to bring some of the work I've done together to try to push for a new job. The site is called optonica (does not mean anything, just like the word!). So far what I've got I'm not really happy with, I just think its a bit boring. I think the word optonica really lends itself to something special, it feels like a very 'designey' word if you know what I mean.  <BR>So, below is what I got (the bigger one is just to give you an idea of context and colours), please can I have some thoughts. Thanks in advance ;) <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20958.gif" alt="logo1"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20959.gif" alt="incontext"></div>

I think the style of the type goes well with the title, but it does need more work (BTW, I like the unicase &quot;A&quot;).

		<div class="commentbody">I like those new proposals, Mike, but I am afraid the sign (OP I guess) is too heavy for that very fragile font below it. No.3 makes me think - maybe you could put just a name Optonica as it is designed in that No.3 suggestion. Even more, the number 3 which you have put there just to mark the suggestion number actually works great with a word. Maybe you could rename your site into &quot;3optonica&quot; It could have a nice pronountiation. Or maybe you could replace 3 by something else keeping this kind of composition. <BR> <BR>In case you would like to continue development on OP sign, you should reconsider the position of P in that elipse. The relationship between the two elements works too disturbing for my eye. There must be something wrong with P's left upper corner and its relationship to the bypassing curve. Another disturbing section might be the end of the O curve under P's on the right side. For me the curve at this point gets too thick comparing to how much thinner it is at the top of the sign.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Dragnim, <BR> <BR>v. 1-10: I'm seeing the Minolta effect myself, but it's not necessarily bothering me. The whole series does have kind of a '70s roller rink feel to it, tho. 6-10, with the 'o' connected to the 't' at the bottom, don't read. The 'ot' ligature looks like a 'd'. Also, the 't' seems way too tall on all of them. Of these, 3 is my favorite. The interior circles on the 'o's are producing some interesting closure, and they're light enough not to create blotches like they do when they're solid. <BR> <BR>On the last group I think you may be off on the wrong track. I'm not sure why 'op' should be emphasized&ndash;it doesn't serve as initials or anything. As well, it makes me think of the OP (Ocean Pacific) sportswear brand that was oh-so-hip in the U.S. in the mid-'80s. Dunno if that brand made it over to the UK, tho, so you may not have to worry about that association. As well, that particular teal/green/whatever doesn't work for me with the greys. Too similar in value, not enough saturation. <BR> <BR>I think Matjaz may be on to something with his recommendation that you use just the 'optonica' type from the last round. It has stark sort of feel to it that I'm liking. <BR> <BR>As a general matter, given that you're using a made-up word you should probably try to keep the type fairly legible. With 'real' words, you can sometimes get away with funkier character shapes because people already know what the character should be from context. <BR> <BR></div>

I'm assuming this is intentional, but I think you can represent this by slightly blurring the left and right sides of the dot in the lc &quot;i&quot;.
