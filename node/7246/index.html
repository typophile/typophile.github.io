		<div class="commentbody">There are really no hard and fast rules... I think contrast is important, otherwise you might as well just use one typeface. But it is also not very interesting if the types have nothing to say to each other. <BR> <BR>It is very common to see neo-grotesques like Univers being paired with humanist sans like Meta these days. I guess designers tend to think humanist sans are slightly more legible than neo-grotesques? So they use the Univers for display and Meta for text. You see, that seems a bit redundant and only confuse the stylistic direction of the publication </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have been reading Bringhurst. He is eloquent and lucid, but I find he uses too many technical/typograhy terms&#40;?&#41;. <BR> <BR>I always use a serif, sans serif combo, just that sometimes, it is not that clear cut. For example, would a serif font like Minion go with Fenice. Assuming the entire Minion family is used, for body and subheads, but Fenice is used at only 36pt and above. <BR> <BR>It would be really interesting to know the specific fonts you guys have married with what you consider good results. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post a pair to start: Franklin Gothic and Berkeley. <BR>This was a combo used when my previous publication was redesigned. <BR> <BR>Gerald: Bringhurst suggested Univers and Meridien, both by Frutiger, but somehow they don&#39;t really work well together, or I haven&#39;t found a way to make them work. I am still trying to place my finger on why. Possibly I haven&#39;t found the right sizes to combine them at. <BR> <BR>The book cover is interesting because most people would not know that the fonts are different. They look similar enough to pass off as one font, so it doesn&#39;t really bother me. <BR> <BR>Would be interesting to know what the others think though.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Pairing typefaces is a challenge I constantly hit in graphic design, which is one of the reasons I decided to learn more about typography.  It was something I didn&#39;t know nearly enough about. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still learning, but here are a few rules that seem to work: <BR> <BR>1. The obvious: pair a serif with a sans-serif when possible.  This is a pragmatic rule simply because you usually need a display face and a text face for design. <BR> <BR>2. Go for balance, not contrast.  At small point sizes, a bold, robust sans will balance your serif text blocks.  At large sizes, a light sans or humanist might balance your serif better.  Balance is possibly the most important rule of design. <BR> <BR>3. Match x-height as close as possible. <BR> <BR>4. Match the geometry as close as possible.  A gothic sans &#40;straight-sided O&#39;s&#41; might not be the best companion for an old-style serif &#40;circular O&#39;s&#41;. <BR> <BR>5. Match the &#34;voice&#34; of all the fonts you choose to the project.  Certain fonts will never work for a telecom ID system.  Others will never work for a basketweaving brochure.  And so on. <BR> <BR>6. The more you know about the background of your fonts - geography, history, etc. - the better you&#39;ll be able to make natural choices. <BR> <BR>Again, I&#39;m still somewhat new at this. <BR> <BR>Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;m reading a lot of useful hints in the replies above &#40;especially Paul&#39;s points 5 and 6&#41;, but I have to agree with Rodolfo. There are no hard and fast rules, not even the &#34;don&#39;t match up fonts that are very close&#34;. For every rule summed up in this thread there are beautiful examples that contradict that rule. Just at the top of my head, check out &#34;The New Cranbrook Design Discourse&#34; &#40;1991&#41;. It&#39;s one of the first books I purchased after joining FontShop, and it made me realize that the possibilities are endless. For example on some pages Bodoni changes abruptly into an Egyptian at a slightly smaller size so the colour almost doesn&#39;t change. The effect, although a bit jarring at first sight, is strangely beautiful and has a subtle tension to it. <BR> <BR>The big thing is that there are many more parameters than just the type design that influence: colour, size, spacing, setting... When designing stuff for FontShop, I had to combine sometimes unwieldy amounts of different typefaces in one design, and somehow there was always a way to make it work. It takes a lot of balancing and trial-and-error, but it&#39;s an extremely satisfying exercise and makes you look at type in a totally different way. <BR> <BR>Karen, one of my more succesful magazine &#40;re&#41;designs combined FF Info with FF Meta, very similar faces, both by Erik Spiekermann. Which proves contrast isn&#39;t always the way. Furthermore the &#34;always use a sans/serif combo&#34; makes me feel really uneasy: it reminds me of that infamous quote from some version of the QuarkXPress manual: &#34;Always use Helvetica for headlines and Times for text&#34; &#40;authentic!&#41;. On the other hand I&#39;ve also done magazines which have more than 7 or 8 very different faces on one page, and that works perfectly well too. Go figure. ;&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yves, your quote from the QuarkXPress Manual is hilarious!!!!! Got a scan? <BR> <BR>Anyway I am glad to hear that you have successfully used 7 or 8 different faces on one page. Would LOVE to see that. <BR> <BR>Think you will have to post some of your stuff &#40;by popular demand&#41;. <BR> <BR>But I have to ask, why did you use both Info and Meta? They are sooo similar. What was your rationale?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Karen and Paul, sorry it took me so long to reply, but every time the fun starts around here it&#39;s bedtime where I live. :/ <BR> <BR>The quote from the QuarkXPress manual is from a slide Erik Spiekermann used in his FontShop presentations. My second favourite is his &#34;Thou shalt have no other typeface before me&#34; slide listing all the German companies that use Helvetica as their corporate ID type &#40;see also his delightful &#34;Rhyme &amp; Reason: A Typographic Novel&#34; pages 100-101&#41; <BR> <BR>The most interesting thing I learned when at FontShop was something Neville Brody said: &#34;Question every rule. Decide for yourself which ones are valid.&#34; That has been my main rationale ever since. <BR>I don&#39;t consider myself a &#34;real&#34; graphic designer:  I approach typography more like an architect or a researcher/scientist. My designs are almost always utilitarian, none of the flashy stuff that gets published in graphic design mags or typography annuals. I&#39;m willing to post some samples to illustrate what I mean, but don&#39;t get your hopes up too high. Give me a day or two, as I&#39;ll have to search through some back-up CD&#39;s. <BR> <BR>The Info and Meta problem was a typical case of setting myself a challenge &#40;I do quite often make things hard on myself just for fun&#41;. I hope my English won&#39;t fail me in trying to explain this case. <BR>I got handed an existing large format magazine which was pretty poorly designed. It used FF Meta as headline face and custom condensed Futura for text. <BR>Instead of redesigning the whole thing and get it over with, I decided to try to find a valid solution using only design elements from the original lay-outs, just like a teacher would help a pupil without imposing his own creative vision. The only thing I dropped was Futura: I avoid overused typefaces unless I can find a watertight good reason use them. As I realized Meta is in fact overused too, I needed to find a way to keep it interesting. And this is a situation where I usually fall back on Neville&#39;s advice. I contradicted the rule &#34;try using typefaces that belong to the same time period or that were designed by the same designer&#34; with the rule &#34;never use two typefaces that are too similar&#34; by adding Info to the mix. The research and resulting design process was extremely gratifying, although the end result is, well, I&#39;m certainly not gonna win any awards. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>See if you agree once you&#39;ve seen the samples and let me know what you think.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Yves, why is there a duplicate of all the files?

D&#39;oh...  <BR>  <BR><i>What font is used for the words, &#34;vacature magazine&#34;?</i> <BR> <BR>Helvetica Black Italic. See, I <i>do</i> use Helvetica once in a blue moon. I was not completely brainwashed after my month at Spiekermann&#39;s. ;&#41;  <BR>  <BR><i>So you used Info and Info Display as the display type and Meta for body text?</i>  <BR>  <BR>No, I also used FF InfoText at text sizes. I&#39;ll post a few more examples where they are used alongside each other. You&#39;ll see: it&#39;s tricky, but it works.  <BR>  <BR><i>When Meta is used at bodytext size, it look a lot like Info, doesn&#39;t it?</i>  <BR>  <BR>Well, yes, but there&#39;s a couple of details that make it work in combination with FF Meta but not with ITC Officina. Again, I&#39;ll post some extra examples.  <BR>  <BR><i>I understand what you said about keeping part of the old design.</i>  <BR>  <BR>Don&#39;t fix it when it ain&#39;t broke &#40;although the original design was badly executed I must say&#41;. I take a humble approach in graphic design, adapting my &#34;style&#34; to the client&#39;s or project&#39;s needs. And then I go and brag about it on the message boards. =D</div>
