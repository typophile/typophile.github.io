body: "It has been suggested, many times, that the letterpress hobby could do with
  a modern guide-book aimed at the absolute beginner.\r\n\r\nI have made an attempt
  to produce such a guide. Aimed at the beginner who would like to start printing
  from home \u201CFirst Steps in Letterpress\u201D runs through the purchase, setting
  up and running of a table-top platen press.\r\n\r\nIt gives the beginner an idea
  of the range of products that can be produced using the letterpress process, and
  the various methods of producing them. Traditional typesetting, photo polymer and
  lino printing are covered.\r\n\r\nThe book has a \u201CReference Section\u201D listing
  suppliers of everything the beginner may need, both in the USA and UK.\r\n\r\nThe
  book also lists places that the beginner can look for further help and advice to
  take the hobby further.\r\n\r\nAvailable now on Kindle at Amazon US: http://j.mp/RURW2H
  and Amazon UK: http://j.mp/RkC9tY\r\n\r\nDave Hughes"
