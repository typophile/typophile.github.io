body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI urgently need an illustrator / type designer to create some type
  in the EXACT Daft Punk 'Get Lucky' / 'Random Access Memories' type style for a reasonable
  fee.\r\n\r\nThis look heavily references the type also from Michael Jackson's 'Thriller'
  record cover.\r\n\r\nPlease only respond if you are 100% confident that you can
  get this quickly, exactly right.\r\n\r\nIt's two words that we need to be illustrated,
  in this exact style.\r\n\r\nSuggestions of good illustrator / type designers who
  could quickly do this welcome, also.\r\n\r\nThanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/daft-punk-get-lucky-remix_6412.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Daft-Punk-Random-Access-Memories

  body: Probably bet to message the original poster directly when offering a quote,
    instead of posting a contact request. It will get to them sooner.
