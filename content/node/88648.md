body: "\r\nIs there a limit for lookup numbers in a font?\r\nI am currently working
  on an Arabic Font in MS VOLT. My font consists of more than 4000 glyphs. Now a days
  I am working on the kerning of pairs. The number of Lookups in my font project has
  reached to 275 and now when I add another Lookup to this project then the compilation
  fails in VOLT. What could be its reason? The options to Use extension lookups and
  to Use Pair Position Format 2 are turned on in the VOLT.\r\n\r\nIf I add new kerning
  pairs to the present lookups even then the compilation fails. Till yet I have made
  a very large number of kerning pairs but as compared to the remaining pairs it is
  very little (I think more than three quarters of kerning is still remaining and
  also I have to add quite a number of lookups to finish the project. So what should
  I do to solve the issue?"
