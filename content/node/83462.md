    ATypI's Letter.2 competition dropped the text I critiqued, and now uses the replacement
    text I suggested ( \"\u2026typefaces from the last ten years that represent excellence
    in type design.\") \r\nEither Jos\xE9 found my argument credible, or he was fed
    up with being harangued :-)"
