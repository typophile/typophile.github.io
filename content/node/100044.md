body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kerouac_5572.jpg]\r\nI like this sign in
  Lowell, Massachusetts. It's hand-lettered in the old-school way, with a relaxed
  grace that speaks of years of discipline. \r\nI like the story it tells, too. I
  didn't know people could defend their views on such arcane matters as punctuation
  with physical force. Now that I know, the first person who looks at this <em>handlettering</em>
  and asks me what <em>font</em> it is will get a knuckle sandwich."

  body: I would like to know who won the fight. Old Bill is sly, if not underhanded,
    while at this point Jack was a corpulent momma's boys. So ... do you know who
    was defending the Oxford comma?

  body: I learned to use the Oxford comma (or the serial comma, as I was taught) by
    Sister Agnes Virginia, who, with her trusty ruler, could have beat the crap out
    of Kerouac and Burroughs one at a time or both together.

    I did. Apparently it messed up his head even worse than it did mine.

    My biggest pet peeve about Truss\u2019s book (that edition anyway) is that the
    text font, Quadraat, did not have kern pairs for comma/period and close quotes,
    in either order. These pairs appear a lot in the text, with distracting holes.
