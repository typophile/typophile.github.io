  big red rectangle and, wouldn't you know, I ended up in a place where I can help
  donate to the cause here at Typophile. I don't remember seeing an announcement for
  it or a plug to kick it off so I thought, hey! let's take this puppy for a spin!
  So I did! so hey! Tell us about it, Joe? Let's not keep it a secret! Inquiring minds
  and those who wish to contribute would like to know :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    to it. =)\r\n\r\nThe concept is if you have sympathy, send Typophile $15. If you
    love Typophile, send $45. And, if it's a true obsession, you can show it with
    a larger donation of $100.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll receive a badge to add to your user
    icon. Let other users know of your undying sympathy (shield), love (heart) obsession
    (drop of blood) for Typophile.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://typophile.com/ad/redirect/39853/\">You
    can contribute here</a> --></strong>\r\n\r\nAlso, if you purchased a tee, or buttons,
    or came to our SF Film Fest in the last 12 months check your inbox for your badge
    to match your contribution. (Some of you made other significant contributions
    this year and you haven't been forgotten.)\r\n"

    movies. One summer we were stuck on our boat in a huge storm down at Lake Powell.
    All we could do was sit inside the boat and pray it let up. My brothers started
    reciting the movie, from the beginning, including songs and silliness. '
