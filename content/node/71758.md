body: "Hiya\r\n\r\nHere's a good one. What opinions to people have on suitable ways
  to display web addresses in body copy?\r\n\r\nThe first element to this is to do
  with punctuation and grammar, in that as a web address sits within a sentence, normal
  punctuation will apply (period at the end of the sentence). Also, it would be desireable
  for the url to be displayed on one line, but if it is too long to fit on one line
  in a column, it should be broken at a suitable place (such as after a slash/virgule).
  Websters encourages this application, whereas Oxford's New Hart's Rules mentions
  the perhaps somewhat antiquated use of 'http://' as well as placing the address
  within angle brackets.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this is typographic - unless there
  was a specific requirement for it (such as a directory), undue attention wouldn't
  ideally want to be granted to the web address, so as not to disrupt the reader's
  flow. Therefore the automatic formatting often applied through today's word processors,
  such as colouring on underlining (troublesome when applied to underscores), are
  unsuitable, and priority should be given to the readability of the text.\r\n\r\nAny
  opinions on how you prefer to set web addresses amongst body copy?"

  body: "With reference to Hart\u2019s rules i\u2019d suggest to put web addresses
    like this [www.webaddress.com]. Or without brackets if you set it that way: http://webaddress.com,
    no colouring or underlining."

  body: You can see it here that if you set it in brackets without the http:// there
    is no colouring through the word processor.

  body: "We substitute angle brackets (U+2329 and U+232A) for the usual \"less\" and
    \"greater\" characters. This for university press book work, no complaints yet.
    Kerning is needed, both with the angle brackets and the slashes (esp. the two
    slashes). Of course, most fonts don't have these characters, just one more reason
    to have a EULA that lets the end user modify the font.\r\n\r\nAs for breaking,
    don't hyphenate (i.e., add a hyphen), and if you break at a period, the period
    should come down."

  body: "> but if it is too long to fit on one line in a column...\r\n\r\nI hate putting
    long URLs in print documents, as they look disruptive and it's difficult for a
    reader to actually copy and use that URL. So in cases like that, I usually ask
    the writer if we could try a different approach, such as just using the site's
    home page URL, or putting the long URL in a footnote, or some other workaround.
    Sometimes they agree to a change like that, sometimes not. "

  body: "We have to put \u2019em in journal body copy all the time. No special styling,
    no brackets. Break after slashes, underscores, question marks etc (but, as Charles
    says, <em>before</em> a dot or it'll give the impression that the sentence is
    finished). Suppress hyphenation, and if the actual URL already has a hyphen in
    it, then try <em>not</em> to break at that (or it'll look like you've hyphenated)
    \u2013 take the hyphen over to the next line if you must break there. If there
    are no suitable punctuation marks to break at, but the URL contains strung-together-words
    (like www. thisisasamplewebaddress.com) then split between words (still without
    inserting a hyphen). Readers should be savvy enough by now to know that URLs don't
    have word spaces in them. If the surrounding text can be massaged to keep the
    URL on one line, all the better. Check long URLs that have got a lot of query
    gubbins on the end of them \u2013 you can often trim a lot of that out and still
    link successfully to the intended page."

  body: "I just checked my <em>Associated Press Stylebook</em>. It recommends using
    the <code>http://</code> at the start, and a period at the end if the URL ends
    a sentence. And, if an address must be carried on multiple lines, \"split it directly
    after a slash or a dot that is part of the address, without an inserted hyphen.\"
    \r\n\r\nAP also advises to use URLs in running text only when the story specifically
    mentions a website. If the address is being used merely to direct the reader to
    a source for additional information, the <em>Stylebook</em> advises putting it
    in a note at the end of the story."

  body: When an address is followed by a punctuation, I like to add a space before
    the punctuation to make clear that it's not part of the address. This is especially
    useful in e-mail and any other online medium where the address might be automatically
    converted into a link by software. It also makes it easier for the reader to highlight
    and copy it if they're saddled with "smart" highlighting. But I think it has a
    place in print media too. If it ends in ".com" you probably don't need the space,
    but if there is a full path, it's good to assume that some of the readers you're
    asking to retype the whole address are going to need all the help they can get
    to do it right.
