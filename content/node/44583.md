  there a way in Fontlab to specify what strokes on the keyboard are assigned to a
  glyph (ie.  I have a glyph that I want to be accessed by typing option-u. can I
  specify that somehow, or do i just need to place the glyph in the corresponding
  cell in fontlab)?\r\n\r\nI've searched through the manual and can;t seem to find
  the answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

  body: "You can't do that in FontLab. The assignment of keys to specific unicodes
    is the responsibility of the keyboard driver/keyboard layout. You could make a
    custom keyboard layout for use with your font using <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele&_sc=1\">Ukulele</a>
    though, but you still have to put your glyphs in the right slots in FontLab first.\r\n\r\nJens"

    specific Mac key combinations? I've googled, but haven't found anything that seems
    to be what I need. Unless there's a simpler way to do what I need to do (assign
    glyphs to the keys so they follow a specific sequence).\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

  body: It all depends which keyboard layout the user has chosen. Don't hack the encoding
    by giving your dingbats the unicode numbers for other characters unless you're
    the only person who is ever going to be using it. To assign particular glyphs
    to particular keystrokes, create a special keyboard layout for your font. If your
    glyphs don't have unicode values, you can always put them in the PUA.

  body: "On a Mac: \r\n* when the user chooses the U.S. English keyboard layout, pressing
    Option-U will produce \xA8 and pressing Option-E will produce \xB4,\r\n* when
    the user chooses the Polish keyboard layout, pressing Option-U will still produce
    \xA8 but pressing Option-E will produce \u0119,\r\n* when the user chooses the
    Czech keyboard layout, pressing Option-U will produce nothing while pressing Option-E
    will produce \u0119,\r\n* when the user chooses the French keyboard layout, pressing
    Option-U will produce \xBA and pressing Option-E will produce \xEA, \r\n* when
    the user chooses the Russian keyboard layout, pressing Option-U will produce \u045E
    and pressing Option-E will produce \u0451.\r\n\r\nAs you see, different keyboard
    layouts produce different characters. You might produce a font that would have
    a \"handy\" character mapping when used with a particular keyboard layout (Swedish,
    German, Czech, U.S. English or whatever your preferred layout is) but most likely,
    your \"handy\" character mapping will be useless for users of keyboard layouts
    other than yours. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "If you restricted your font to the ten numbers (which presumably occur in
    the usual order irrespective of keyboard language), then you could have four sequences
    of ten symbols in each font (plain, shift, option, and option-shift).\r\n\r\nOther
    than that, just use the North American keyboard, which covers a fair-sized constituency.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for all the assistance, everyone.\r\n\r\nNick, your suggestion sounds
    like what I ended up doing.\r\n\r\nMy original post probably should've been more
    clear about what I was trying to do. I wanted to create a font that was all the
    numbers 1-99 each in a circle. I know there are existing fonts that are like this,
    but I thought it would be a fun challenge, and a way to get to know fontlab better.
    I've used the freeware font Combinumerals in the past, but was always annoyed
    by the way the glyphs were laid out on the keys. So I wanted to make sure that
    mine was in a logical order. I was hoping that I could assign a keystroke to a
    glyph, but since that's not possible, I just figured out where everything was.
    So everything seems to be cool now -- the QWERTY row gives you 10-19, the ASDFG
    row gives you 20-21, shift-QWERTY gives you 40-41, and option-QWERTY gives you
    70-79, etc. etc., etc.\r\n\r\nI just have a little more tweaking to do, and it'll
    be done.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

    and option-QWERTY gives you 70-79, etc. etc., etc.\r\n\r\nOf course this only
    makes sense if the user is using a U.S. English keyboard. On the German keyboard,
    the top row is QWERTZ, not QWERTY, while on the French keyboard, it's AZERTY,
    not QWERTY etc. etc., etc. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if forcing the user to install
    a particular keyboard layout that he's never used before, to type in some characters,
    is very user-friendly. Also, keep in mind that once the user generates a PDF with
    numbers typed in this way, the underlying text will not be searchable and will
    yield nonsense. \r\n\r\nI think you'd be better off (at least as a complementary
    solution) with contextual alternates, initial, final and medial forms, and stylistic
    sets. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
