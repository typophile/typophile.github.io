  for so long, here is - at last -  <BR>the expanded multi-level all ages new challenge  <BR>which
  marks the next chapter in the history of our  <BR>beloved Type ID Pop Quiz. <BR>
  <BR>Here&#39;s the deal: <BR>Each line is set in a different typeface. Identify  <BR>each
  typeface and find the odd one out. You&#39;ll  <BR>probably find some couples in
  there, but it was  <BR>my intention that one has a distinctive trait that  <BR>sets
  it apart from the other five. It is something  <BR>obvious, so entry-level Typophiles
  should be able  <BR>to find it as well once the typefaces are known. <BR>Have fun!

  body: Now <i>that</i> is an interesting guess, but that&#39;s also the main  <BR>reason
    why I included John Sans&#42; which is causing me so  <BR>much trouble now. Both
    Syntax and John Sans are drawn  <BR>on the &#34;skeleton&#34; of a hystoric face
    &#40;Sabon and Baskerville  <BR>respectively&#41;. <BR> <BR>Peter, there is indeed
    a forward-leaning motion in FF Quadraat  <BR>Sans, but the other typefaces also
    have subtle differences in  <BR>stress and contrast which makes this an unlikely
    solution. <BR> <BR>&#42;I originally intended to include a Foundry typeface to
    avoid  <BR>this situation but that would&#39;ve ruined the thing I&#39;m looking
    for. <BR>Can you guess which Foundry family I&#39;m speaking about? <BR>Then you
