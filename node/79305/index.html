<p>And go to the final page and see &ldquo;Freeware Fonts&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>All these typodesigners, as Ray Larabie, Klein, and other don&rsquo;t allow to distribute, re-distribute and to derivate or remix their works, according their EULA. They don&rsquo;t want and won&rsquo;t hear the OpenFontLibrary&rsquo;s persuasion. These fonts are closed source while Linux is an open source software.</p>
<p>I found the Ray Larabie and other proprietary typodesigners freeware fonts housed on Ubuntu software center. Then why did Ubuntu house the Ray Larabie and other proprietary typodesigners <strong>closed source</strong> freeware fonts on its software center?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m against the house of Ray Larabie and other proprietary typodesigners fonts on Ubuntu because they&rsquo;re closed source! The closed source fonts, although are freeware, mustn&rsquo;t be housed on Ubuntu or any distros of Linux!</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the users of Linux know what open source is and Linux is open source, if they know, they&rsquo;ll think all which are on Ubuntu are open source, then they&rsquo;ll modify and [re-]distribute the Ray Larabie and other proprietary typodesigners fonts without realizing that the derived works and [re-]distribution aren&rsquo;t allowed by Ray Larabie and other proprietary typodesigners!</p>
<p>I know you would tell us that there&rsquo;s description in fonts, but not all will view the fonts, not all know English, know reading in English and what EULA is!</p>
<p>I know you would say they can take the free-ware fonts on Ubuntu but they can&rsquo;t derive your works for projects and themes of Ubuntu or other. But if they want to modify? The closed source fonts mustn&rsquo;t be housed on any distros of Linux, only the open source fonts must be housed on Ubuntu or other distros of Linux because the users want to modify.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m against the house of closed source free-fonts on Ubuntu!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fundamentalist and fanatic Linuxer.</p>

<p>Seriously how many Ubuntu users are going to modify the fonts that come with the product? Does the product come with a font editor? The new Ubuntu fonts were made using proprietary tools including Microsoft VTT.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t import or care how many Ubuntu users are going to modify the fonts. Do you know FontForge and Inkscape? Then Ubuntu users are going to modify the letters of the proprietary typodesigners fonts at Inkscape, for example, they&rsquo;ll modify vectorizing a letter &lsquo;G&rsquo; of CAC PInafore font:</p>

<p>How will you react if an Ubuntu user use your closed source freeware font and modify it at Inkscape?</p>
<p>And FontForge, it happens the same thing that in Inkscape.</p>
<p>Rhey want to modify the fonts at Inkscape at FontForge for projetcs, works, adds, magazines and books.</p>

<code>
~$ aptitude show ttf-larabie-deco
Package: ttf-larabie-deco                
New: yes
State: not installed
Version: 1:20011216-1.1
Priority: optional
<strong>Section: non-free/fonts</strong>
Maintainer: Erich Schubert <erich@debian.org>
Uncompressed Size: 7,336 k
Depends: defoma
Recommends: fontconfig
[&c. emphasis mine]

<p>I imagine the licence file itself will also be in /usr/share/doc/$packagename/copyright if Ubuntu follows the Debian model.</p>
<p>Unless you use one of the [[http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html|Free Software Foundation endorsed distributions]] which contain no non-open-source software, it is almost inevitable that some things you can get from a package manager will not be Open Source, be they binary drivers for graphics cards or pieces of software such as Flash. I don’t see why that is a bigger issue with Fonts then any of these.</p>

<p>Exact!</p>
<p><cite>Following are the GNU/Linux distributions we know of which have a firm policy commitment to only include and only propose free software. They <strong>reject non-free applications, non-free programming platforms, non-free drivers, or non-free firmware “blobs”</strong>. If by mistake they do include any, they remove it. To learn more about what makes for a free GNU/Linux distribution, see our Guidelines for Free System Distributions.</cite></p>
<p>Then why were the closed source <em><strong>pseudofree</strong></em>-fonts of Ray Larabie or other proprietary typodesigners lodged on Ubuntu software center? They must be removed!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll fight and discuss the non-free fonts with Mark, Ubuntu&rsquo;s founder and presidnet of Canonical. I&rsquo;ll invite and persuade Mark to remove the closed source fonts from Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Kevin is correct. Those fonts should be removed. If someone can remove them from the repository I would be pleased. I wanted to update the fonts because I don&rsquo;t like the idea of people being stuck with shoddy fonts with created a decade ago. It seems it&rsquo;s impossible to update them so they should be removed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of pressure on me to comply to everyone else&rsquo;s idea of what constitutes an acceptable license agreement. If my EULA isn&rsquo;t acceptable, choose someone else&rsquo;s fonts.</p>

<p><em>Then why were the closed source pseudofree-fonts of Ray Larabie or other proprietary typodesigners lodged on Ubuntu software center? They must be removed!</em></p>
<p>If you looked at the list of endorsed Linux distributions, you would have noticed that Ubuntu is not there (nor almost any other well-known distribution). The reason for this is that all the major distributions include software which is free&ndash;as in you don&rsquo;t have to pay for it&ndash;but not open-source. Indeed, they even have an [[http://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html|explanation]] page which states: <em>&ldquo;Ubuntu provides specific repositories of nonfree software, and Canonical expressly promotes and recommends nonfree software under the Ubuntu name in some of their distribution channels.&quot;</em></p>
<p>It is not as if fonts are the only non-open-source pieces of software shipped by Ubuntu or Canonical. Ubuntu has lots of packages which disallow modification. For example, the [[http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/nvidia-173|Nvidia drivers]] have a [[http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/restricted/n/nvidia-graphics-drivers-173/nvidia-graphics-drivers-173_173.14.28-0ubuntu1/nvidia-173.copyright|license]] which says:</p>
<p><em>No Reverse Engineering.  Customer may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain the source code.</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how this is different from the distribution of these fonts&hellip;</p>

If you don&rsquo;t want non-free software don&rsquo;t install it, I don&rsquo;t want it myself, but it does not give you the right to insult others for not accepting your rules. I myself consider non-free software immoral but it does not give me the right to insult people who don&rsquo;t share my ideas, also I&rsquo;m grateful for people who provide free of charge fonts for non-commercial use as we say in Egypt <em>half blindness is better than total blindness</em>.</p>
<p>@fujito 
They do pay, not that much but good enough for someone who would release his fonts under libre license anyway.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll forward this topic and your messages to Mark, Canonical and Linux foundations, trying to invite and persuade them to remove your fonts and the non-open source fonts from the repository and from Ubuntu software centers.</p>
<p>@jacobh</p>
<p>Ah, yes, I read and I understood, but I&rsquo;m still against the distribution of <strong>non-open source</strong> fonts to any distros of Linux because many Linux users will use the proprietary typodesigners fonts which are under EULAs, for moidfying them at Inkscape, Xara Xtreme and FontForge for adds, homeworks, works, &ldquo;flyers&rdquo;, films, videos of Youtube, etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to invite and persuade Mark, Canonical foundation and other Linux distros founders to remove all the non-open source fonts and replace them by the open source fonts of Google Fonts Directory and Debian Fonts from Gürack from Switzerland.</p>
<p>@typodermic
Yeah, I love when you call us fanatics. But Winusers, fanboys of Mac OS, of FontLab, Fontmanager, FontCreator, etc. are fanatic too. Will they annoy you?</p>
<p>@mjerkan
Did you mean Canonical paid the open source fonts Ubuntu for the typodesigner Dalton Maag?</p>
<p>@fujito, I didn&rsquo;t call Ray Larabie criminal, but I&rsquo;m only and just against the distribution, lodging or addition of any non-open source fonts to any distros of Linux because they&rsquo;re under EULAs, which are enemies of GPL.</p>
<p>@Khaled
I don&rsquo;t want because they abused of prices and molested us, wanted and run after our money! The prices are outrageous and absurd!</p>
<p>Badwindows, Bad Apple, BadAdobe, BadCorel and BadLab are greedy, thieves, manipulator and made us, specially Latin Americans and Africans suffering a lot. They think we all are rich and have much money.</p>
<p>But and the Africans? Didn&rsquo;t you see many and many Africans are suffering, sick, poor and are hungary and thirsty? Will the Africans pay for Badwindows, Bad Apple, BadAdobe, BadCorel and BadLab? No, because they don&rsquo;t have much money and are poor, if they bought them, they&rsquo;ll lose their life with hunger and thrist!</p>
<p>Yes, the most of Africans use Badwindows, but their Badwindows are pirate. In Africa, Badwindows, BadAdobe and  BadCorel are pirate and are cheaper. Do you want to see the real price that Africans must pay for Adobe Photoshop?</p>
<p>In Africa and South Africa, Photoshop costs full US $849.00 ex tax and upgrade from US $245.00 ex tax!</p>
<p>Will Africans pay for it? NO, they&rsquo;re expensive! While in USA, it costs full from US $699.00 and upgrade from US $199.00 and in UK, it costs full from £657.60 or £548.00 ex VAT and upgrade from £190.80 and £159.00 ex VAT!!!!</p>
<p>Bad Adobe is greed, thief and hypocrite!</p>
<p>Have Badwindow$, Bad Apple and Bad Adobe ever distributed some always-free Adobe softwares to some 
poor Africans? Nothinng and never. What they want is $$$$! They don&rsquo;t worry about the Africans and don&rsquo;t care or mind what happened with the Africans! They worry only about the money.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re already richer, why are they still running after our money. Weren&rsquo;t they pleased with how much money they have? They&rsquo;re megalomaniac, egoist and egocentric!</p>
<p>If Badwindows, BadAdobe, BadCorel and Bad Apple want to be the death of the piracy, they have to reduce the nonesnse prices! If they don&rsquo;t want to reduce, the piracy will always grow up and will never finish! If they want to be the death of virus and hackers, they have to open the source, but if they don&rsquo;t want, Winusers and Maccers will always be favourite targets of hackers and virus! They&rsquo;re su.ckers! They&rsquo;re Masonic Illuminati who want $$$$$$!</p>
<p>LONG LIVE LINUX!
LONG LIVE UBUNTU!
LONG LIVE OPEN SOURCE!
LET&rsquo;S BE INDEPENDENT OF MONOPOLIST EMPIRES OF ADOBE, COREL, APPLE AND WINDOWS!
I WISH AFRICA BE FREE OF THESE EMPIRES AND GET FREE LINUX AND DON&rsquo;T PAY MORE THE PROPRIETARY SOFTWARES!</p>
<p>Down with Adobe, Corel, Apple and Windows!
Let&rsquo;s fight for the revolution of freedom, open source and free softwares or we&rsquo;ll die as the French revolutionary woman said to the public in French: Allons lutter ou mourrons!
Remember of the French lemme: Liberté, Fraternité et Égalité that the mnopolist empires viotaed!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve just been pointed to this by a fellow member of the pkg-fonts team in Debian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually funny as I just took over the &ldquo;ttf-larabie&rdquo; fonts package in name of the team. The main point was actually improving the packaging techniques and drop support for a few obsolete packaging behaviour.</p>
<p>This package is part of the &ldquo;non-free&rdquo; section in Debian and this is why it is also present in Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Why is it in non free? Because the license does not meet de Debian Free Software Guidelines (<a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)">http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)</a>. These guidelines are certainly not a way to reject those who develop software that doesn&rsquo;t meet them or put shame on them. 
Not being free according to these guidelines is certainly not a shame and burst in flames of hell.</p>
<p>As it is probably known (and somehow debated by the FSF), Debian (let me quote the DFSG : &quot; acknowledge that some of our users require the use of works that do not conform to the Debian Free Software Guidelines. We have created &ldquo;contrib&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-free&rdquo; areas in our archive for these works.&quot;</p>
<p>So, as a consequence :</p>
<ul>
<li>ttf-larabie will remain packaged as it has apparently a quite significant user base : <a href="http://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=ttf-larabie">http://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=ttf-larabie</a></li>
<li>it will remain in the non-free section of the archive so as an extra areas of the Debian archive, which is not part of Debian</li>
<li>any derived distribution is free to include it or to choose not including it.</li>
</ul>
<p>To the original author : please don&rsquo;t spread misconception of what free software is and how it should be promoted. My personal opinion is that, by pushing your ideas the way you&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;re doing more harm than good to Free Software.</p>
<p>And, by the way, I very much doubt that Mark Shuttleworth will follow your suggestion. Just guessing..:-)</p>

If Mark won&rsquo;t follow my suggestion and won&rsquo;t want to remove the non-free or non-open source fonts from Ubuntu, the problem is his and Ubuntu.</p>
<p>@Ray Larabie, if Mark won&rsquo;t follow my suggestion, the problem will be his and from Ubuntu, and get unpleased and don&rsquo;t be glad because the Linux users will use your fonts to modify at FontForge. I hope they use your fonts and you get furious when you&rsquo;ll see your modified fonts used by users on their blogs.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ll see your font that was modified and used by an user on a non-English-speaking blog, principally Brazilian, Colombian or Italian. Will you prosecute him by having your font? Will you send an e-mail, writing in English to him if he doesn&rsquo;t speak or understand English? If you send an e-mail to him, in English, he&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re a spammer.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be nevrous, because I&rsquo;m testing and challenging you with these questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very mature than you. I know what the users are doing. I know what happens with them. I know a lot the world of piracy.</p>

In reality, I&rsquo;m just some guy with a computer who makes fonts all day. Some are free, some are not. Sometimes I make mistakes. For instance, contributing to this nonsensical thread.</p>
<p>There is one thing that does upset me, personally. There&rsquo;s no shortage of gift horse mouth lookers on the internet. Make something free and you&rsquo;re guaranteed to have someone bitch about it. I doubt that an average font designer who isn&rsquo;t known for free fonts has to deal with the amount of bullshit that I have to deal with.</p>
<p>If any students are reading this and considering making free fonts, be prepared to deal with interesting individuals like Kevin. People like this will email you, introduce themselves and tell you that everything you&rsquo;re doing is wrong. So often, I&rsquo;ll be working my ass off and there&rsquo;ll be another internet complainer, bitching about this and that. It&rsquo;s not exactly motivational. My prices are too low. My prices are too high. I don&rsquo;t support certain languages. My EULA should be open source.</p>
<p>I have to admit, these internet complainers get to me.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Kevin:</p>
<p>Stay the fuck away from me, motherfucker. Don&rsquo;t email me. Don&rsquo;t even fucking mention me on Typophile. You&rsquo;re succeeded in pissing me off. Congratulations. You can have a big laugh. You&rsquo;re a big revolutionary hero who has struck a blow against the big font corporations. You sat in from of your computer and changed the world.</p>
<p>And while we&rsquo;re on the subject: go fuck yourself.</p>

Well, I&rsquo;m not. Although I do disagree with the original poster&rsquo;s views, open-source fonts do serve a purpose, and I am glad that a few of them exist.
As I&rsquo;ve noted, in general, most free Linux distributions don&rsquo;t make free closed-source software available. This is a serious issue in the area of device drivers. In the case of fonts, it is likely a significantly less pressing concern, although I think that the Ubuntu people have made the right decision.
However, I realize that you were no doubt just jesting as a reaction to the original poster&rsquo;s unfortunate style.</div>

<li>the world is not like you think it is.</li>
<li>bundled ubuntu software is not fully GPL and open source.</li>
<li>you are a dumb-ass who can&rsquo;t think or listen.</li>
<li>you will never have a <em>smart</em> girlfriend/boyfriend, if you don&rsquo;t change.</li>
<li>Ray here will not takes legal measures against somebody modifying fonts bundled with ubuntu, never intended to do, just wanted to do the world something good. It is not his fault that his free fonts were bundled with Ubuntu without a GPL. You are fighting a war that does not exist. You do this because you have a boring life I assume. I know people like you, sitting at their parents place, not working or doing anything. Your life is the internet. There are no people giving you positive emotions. Get yourself help, talk with a therapist!</li>
<li>as part of your therapy, you should avoid places like Typophile, which let you fall into an agression pattern (you feel forced to provoke, you feel happy about your rude comments and the answers), because this is your only source of emotional feedback.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ray - Sorry you&rsquo;re getting abuse from certain jerks and zealots in the open source community. Like most religious or dogmatic groups, the huge majority of the people there are reasonable, kind and helpful. But there are always a few that decide to be fanatical and misrepresent the group as a bunch of fundamentalist wackos. They&rsquo;re not worth your time.</p>
<p>Everyone - There are valid and attractive reasons to release a font as open source, but as we&rsquo;ve seen here there are some people who heap abuse on designers instead of thanks. The best way to minimize that, and protect yourself, is to use the [[http://scripts.sil.org/ofl|SIL Open Font License (OFL)]]. That license is well-accepted, legally-reviewed and has significant protections for the designer. If you use the OFL then the target for abuse shifts from you to the authors and advocates of the OFL. We deal with the zealots so you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<em>&ldquo;Seriously how many Ubuntu users are going to modify the fonts that come with the product?&quot;</em>
Well, me, for one.
Really, how many users are going to modify the fonts that come with Windows?
So why bother mentioning them in the Windows EULA?</p>
<p>In matters of rights, which copyright/licensing assumedly will expand or curtail, I don&rsquo;t see how the number of people who may or may not assert those rights is relevant.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As a Linux user and open source enthuasiast, I find this debate raised by Kevin irrelevant. TTF/OTF formats are standard, source/matrix files in addition to these are great for open source scholars, but in real life ? Hmmm&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already hard to make type designers understand we need less restrictive licences in order to use typefaces for text and not just for branding ; if we discourage Ubuntu / Ray Larabie initiatives with such zealot criticism, then we&rsquo;re doomed.</p>
<p>We need to proceed step by step. First of all, the users, the readers, the writers, the designers and then, only then, we&rsquo;ll start byzantine debate in order to determine if vfb sources is more or less appropriate than fontforge sources. BTW, UFO is possibly a good compromise, it works with FontLab, FontLab, Glyphs and others type editors, I guess.</p>
<p>In that particular matter, the big deal is perhaps to convert the VFB of the Ubuntu fonts into UFO. Could we not do it peacefully without insulting people ?</p>

<cite>Practically speaking, what does “source” mean when we talk about “open source fonts”?</cite></p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean what you seem to be thinking. Compiled TrueType fonts will do just fine - a textual source listing or a font-editor format file is not required.</p>
<p>It means that the license has to allow me (perhaps with the restriction that I allow the same privilege to the next guy - GNU versus BSD) to put the font in a font editor, make changes, and <em>distribute</em> the result. That is the generally-accepted distinction between &ldquo;open source&rdquo; and &ldquo;not open source&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that some software where nearly all you can do with the source is look at it has also been called open source. And this does have some benefit in maintaining the software. (You can fix bugs and recompile for your own internal use, perhaps.)</p>

<p>Why do you need to put an /@/ in front of someone&rsquo;s name to clarify that you are addressing them? Leaving it out will achieve the same effect.</p>

<p>That applies if that ethic is taken literally, but if it&rsquo;s simply understood to mean conformance to a traditional rule-based system of morality with the nonsense removed - the prohibitions of actions which don&rsquo;t violate the rights of other persons - then that problem is avoided. Although I suppose that Aleister Crowley was no more a Libertarian than he was a Utilitarian&hellip; so, &ldquo;An it harm none, do as thou wilt&rdquo; may not have been sufficiently well specified or defined for this kind of criticism.</p>

<p>Ray, these are not open source rules. This is a politicized agenda of freedom extremists who constitute only a part of open source community. Linus Torvalds, the creator and the principle figure behind Linux, has not once said that he used GPL (the &ldquo;freedom license&rdquo;) purely because it enticed organizations to contribute back qnd not because he subscribed to the liberty-or-death point of view (quite clearly represented here by the throllish OP). In other words there is plenty of sensible people using GPL for practical reasons, but there is also a vocal activist community, which is mostly notable for being just that - vocal.</p>

<p>That is a judgement call you yourself will have to make for yourself. If you are expecting others to make&rsquo;em for you, you will become their tool.</p>
