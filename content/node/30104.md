  written forms like notes etc unlike proper documents for Emperors documents etc
  but does that mean that they did not have serifs on them or did they? i have seen
  an example of them but don't know if the ticks at ends of letters count as serifs
  because they seem slightly different as they are handwritting-like. Can someon eplease
  clarify the above for me. I would also like to know Rustic forms, Roman uncials,
  insular uncials are serif based lettering too or do they not count as they are not
  too relevant in the copy i have. please explain.\r\nPS if the humanist bookhand
  evolved in italy in 15th century was based on Carolingian inscriptions they surely
  the above would be serifs.Am i irght in saying this although the above don't seem
  like proper serifs. Are they known to be serifs?"

  body: "Carolingian is a clear and manageable script that was \"established\" by
    the educational reforms of Charlemagne in the latter part of the 8th and early
    9th centuries. As rediscovered and refined in the Italian Renaissance by the humanists,
    the script survives as the basis of the present-day <a href=\"http://www.ejf.org.uk/Resources/JRNarticle.pdf\">Roman</a>
    alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/wiki/Carolingian_Minuscule\">Carolingian
    minuscule</a>, was then a highly legible script which the Humanists called \u201Clittera
    antiqua\u201D, \u201Cthe ancient letter\u201D, wrongly believing that it was the
    script used by the ancient Rome\_Romans (it was invented in the reign of Charlemagne,
    though only used significantly after that era).\r\n\r\nCarolingian minuscule was
    the direct and linear ancestor of <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/20252\">blackletter</a>,
    too.\r\n\r\nCarolingian, although legible, was time-consuming and labour-intensive
    to produce. It was large and wide and took up a lot of space on a \_manuscript.
    As early as the 11th century, different forms of Carolingian were already being
    used, and by the mid-12th century, a clearly distinguishable form, able to be
    written more quickly to meet the demand for new <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/29875?from=2&comments_per_page=1\">books</a>."

    body: so were these scripts serif? or do those not count as serifs? is it originally
      known to be serif letterforms on those manuscripts?

  body: "Miss Gigg et al,\r\n\r\nI have been twice now to St. Gallen in northeast
    Switzerland (less than an hour by train from Zurich) to visit the Stiftbibliotek.
    For those of you who don't know it, this is an absolutely amazing library that
    served as one of the real repositories for the written word when everything went
    dark. For anyone interested in calligraphy, and in this hand in particular, it's
    a marvelous stop.\r\n\r\nThe two outstanding things for me are their manuscript
    collection -- much of it on display -- and the brand-new manuscript they have
    commissioned. I spent a lot of time looking at pages written by Alcuin (The Very
    Man Himself!) from around 800, they are right there in the display cases to be
    seen from inches away. He was not just a good teacher, but a most accomplished
    scribe in his own right.\r\n\r\nAnd in a private space (note the temerity with
    which i begin a sentence with a conjunction . . .) which can be reached by prior
    request, they have a modern manuscript called something like \"The Testament of
    the Trees.\" (I hope someone Swiss can jump in here and correct what are bound
    to be some inaccuracies -- I speak of this from the vantage point of great admiration
    and passion more than from solid knowledge.) The book was commissioned by the
    library and was written out skin by skin by the best scribes of today in that
    part of the world, on vellum, using ground pigments and home-made inks, in German,
    French, Italian and Romansch languages. The texts all have to do with trees and
    the fragile environment of the earth. \r\n\r\nWhat is so disarming about the book,
    though, is that it is written in hands that feel medieval, and using colors that
    feel medieval to make initial caps and pictures, but the pictures show subjects
    such as a bicyclist cresting the top of a hill with a large motorcar just behind,
    or an image of the space shuttle hurtling into the void. Quite marvelous to have
    the medieval kit of raw materials and styles, but with unabashedly modern content.
    Important and meaningful texts, too.\r\n\r\nVisitors are encouraged to make copies
    of this book, but not in the way you might think: It is verboten to take pictures
    of it, and there are *no* postcards of it for sale, but you may come in with paper
    and pencil or pen, and copy out the pages by hand, just as they did 1200 years
    ago!\r\n\r\nI cannot recommend enough a visit to this place if you have not yet
    been there.  http://www.stiftsbibliothek.ch\r\n\r\nBruce "

  body: "missgiggles, stop thinking of writing as having serifs. Think of writing
    \ as a practice in which a writer leads into a downstroke with a little upstroke
    and ends or leads out of his or her stroke with a little upstroke. This is not
    how most of us learned to write, but it is how writing was practiced in medieval
    times. By the end of the middle ages a more complicated pattern or leading into
    and leaving downstrokes had emerged in some formal scripts. The serif is the residue
    of the 'formaliztion' of these elements <em>in a new technology of disseminating
    texts</em>. The new technology involves punch-cutting, which is a sculpting. \r\n\r\n\"Formalization'

    century and elsewhere (though I haven't checked them all), they were not referred
    to as serifs. In the terminology of the 15th century writing consists of the horizontal
    head-stroke  [<em>testa</em>], the curved down-stroke or body-strke [<em>corpo</em>],
    the narrow diagonal [<em>virgula</em>], and the vertical down-stroke [<em>asta</em>].
    The closest this comes to 'serif' is the 'horizontal head-stroke.'\r\n\r\nThe

    surfing through wikipedia and others it appears that serif (the word) first appeared

    \"linguistic speculations\" in <em>Letterletter</em> (page 94f). Essentially they
    depend on the a common ancestry of the English <em>scrape</em>, <em>score</em>
    and <em>scratch</em>; the Dutch <em>schreef</em> and <em>schrijven</em>; the German
    <em>Schraffe</em> and <em>schreiben</em>; and the Latin <em>scribere</em> in the
    Greek stem <strong>skarifa</strong>.\r\n\r\nIn Dutch <em>schreef</em> is the past
    tense of <em>schrijven</em> (to write) and \"\u2026the scratch made by carpenters
    and metlworkers as a guide for cutting. In punch cutting a schreef is first of
    all the initial scratch on the blank punch marking the terminal of the stroke
    of a letter. [\u2026] In punch cutting the meaning of the word was extended to
    the terminal itself and finally restricted again to the protruding parts of the
    terminal [\u2026] so that a letter with cold terminals [\u2026] is now referred
    to as a letter without <em>schreven</em> [\u2026]\"\r\n\r\nMy own homegrown \"imaginition
    of origins\" relies on the observation that <em>serif</em> is a back formation
    fron <em>sans serif</em> and on the double meaning of <em>schreef</em>. \r\n\r\nIt
    is possible that when the 'grotesques' emerged they were considered as not having
    a scriptorial precedent, hence: <em>scrijf-loos</em> (literally: 'writing-less').
    Because of 'semantic drift,' multiple-referents, cross-language pronounciational
    slippage, and the fact that a salient feature of these 'writing-less\" forms was
    the abscence of an elaborated head-stroke at the scratch or <em>schreef</em> marking
    the termination of the stroke of the letter, <em>scrijf-loos</em> could have become
    confounded with \"without <em>schreef</em> in the sense of sans (elaborated) <em>scratch</em>
    or <em>skarifa</em>.\r\n\r\nBut who really knows?"
