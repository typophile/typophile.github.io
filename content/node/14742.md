body: "<strong> [[Indices]] : [[Books]] : A Tally of Types </strong>\r\n\r\n<em>A
  Tally of Types</em> was first published in 1953 as a 'Christmas Book' by Cambridge
  University Press. It consisted of a series of short essays on a number of (English)
  Monotype typefaces in use at Cambridge. <!--break--> The essays on individual types
  were set in the type in question. There was also a general essay on Monotype's type
  development up to 1922. The author was [[Stanley Morison]]. As a source of strictly
  accurate historical material, the book is not always to be relied upon: there are
  elements of publicity and of self-publicity which are not always consistent with
  strict historical accuracy. (For instance, it is widely believed that the account
  Morison gives of the design of [[Times New Roman]] is not to be accepted at face
  value; nor his account of the design of [[Bembo]] italic.) Nevertheless, the book
  is a useful and interesting source of information on Monotype faces in the first
  half of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 a revised edition was produced by
  CUP, with contributions from P M Handover, Netty Hoeflake, Harry Carter, Nicholas
  Baker and John Dreyfus which added essays on some additional typefaces, and included
  some notes which added to, or corrected, Morison's essays.\r\n\r\nA third edition,
  a facsimile of the second but with a new introduction by Mike Parker, was published
  by David R Godine in 1999."
