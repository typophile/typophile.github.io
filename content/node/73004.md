  body: "FontForge is free and very powerful, but it's hardly user-friendly. I still
    highly recommend it if you're up to the challenges of installing it and climbing
    a rather steep learning curve. It's worth it just for the Spiro drawing mode.\r\n\r\n[[http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/|Fontstruct]]
    Is a fairly simple web-based application for font creation, but it is specialized
    for making modular designs."

    Fontographer. I started in Fontforge, and then found a steep learning curve for
    Fontlab. I still use Fontforge for most of my work, Fontlab isn't as fun for me.\r\n\r\nI
    think Fontforge is easy. Also, on a Mac you just get the .dmg available on Fontforge's
    website. On windows, you just get the Mingw package, and it runs right away. On
    linux just do the normal install procedure for your favorite distro.\r\n\r\nUnless
    you're on linux, an easy download is on the fontforge website."
