  did a promotional animation intro which you can \r\nsee here, along with a comprehensive
  pdf:\r\n\r\nwww.monotypefonts.com/sg\r\n\r\nPress release [[http://www.monotypeimaging.com/aboutus/pr_display.aspx?year=2008&pr=456|here.]]\r\n\r\nThanks."

    for this?\r\n\r\nThere looked to be some interesting drawings at the start of
    the animation. Nothing else really related to the typeface really for the rest
    of it."

  body: "Hi H\xF6fe. Yes, the promo isn't a showcase. It's supposed to be a striking,\r\ncinematic
    introduction/teaser. The intention is it makes an impression, \r\nbecause it's
    unusual, and generates interest from a wider range of web sites. \r\nToo early
    to say whether it's working but wanted to try something different.\r\n\r\nThe
    pdf shows of the design well, I hope, and has some notes at the back. \r\nObviously
    the press release has information relating to the design.\r\nAnything else you
    want to know just ask.\r\n\r\n>I\u2019d love to hear what your main inspiration
    & references were!\r\n\r\nHi Kris. In some respects it's like Neo Sans, which
    I designed,  \r\nwith the curves taken out. Not all the curves obviously. \r\nThat
    would be hideous, but enough to make the design a bit \r\nmore versatile I think.\r\n\r\nSo
    the same things that influenced Neo. Gerard Unger's \r\nexcellent open designs
    like Argo, Dave Farey's Cachet, etc.\r\nIt's more industrial looking than the
    former and less curvy \r\nthan the latter.\r\n\r\n"
