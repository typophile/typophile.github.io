body: This font was more common in the 1980s. It appears to be a proportional typewriter/wordprocessor
  font.  Michelle Obama used this font in her thesis at Princeton.  IBM used this
  font in their DIsplaywriter manuals.  Royal Typewriter used the font in their LetterMaster
  manual.  I have searched far and wide but no one knows anything about this font
  or the machine used to create it.  The 5's are unique and this is a stressed font.  Many
  fonts are some characteristics but no matches.

  body: "Unfortunately none of those really were even close.  This is a stressed sans
    like Optima or Lucinda Sans and those on the list weren\u2019t stressed at all.
    \ The y in company does not curl and many of those had curly y\u2019s."
