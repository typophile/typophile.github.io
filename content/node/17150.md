body: "I started this display type some weeks ago, and it has turned from a slab serif
  into a stenciled slab. I still work on the original.\r\n\r\nMy intensions was to
  gather some of the things and charactistics i like from diffrent slab's and make
  my own interpretation of it - including my additions to make it more modern. It's
  not a diffinate display type, and will, in it's original form (the slab) work for
  text on print as well.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys, gods and goddesses think?\r\n\r\nI
  just made a quick specimen for critics - not very nice ;)\r\n\r\n/Benjamin"

  body: I'll offer my thoughts, although I'm but a mere mortal. I like the feel of
    this so far. I'm not convinced about the rounded notches though. It's interesting,
    but it doesn't seem to work at smaller sizes. Great so far. I like stencil types,
    and this has a nice feel.

  body: "Nice indeed. And I like the notches.\r\n\r\nThe S/s seem to have an excess
    of gaps in comparison to the other glyphs; try leaving only the one gap in the
    middle, or only the two on the top and bottom."

  body: "good point regarding the detailing of the \"S\" and \"s\". I vote for a gap
    top and bottom with a solid middle section. Acheive the stencil aesthetic while
    retaining the beautiful, curving portion of the \"S\" glyphs.\r\n\r\nI also like
    the notches. It made me think that there is an imaginary stencil cutter that has
    a little quirck in the mechanics that occasionaly causes a little divit to appear
    in the letter forms.\r\n\r\nI am an exhibit designer. I am always interested in
    type which has small details that come out when the type is used very large. Small
    details keep giant type from feeling cartoony when the visitor is closer."
