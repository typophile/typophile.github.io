body: "This was made by a Great-Grandfather for his charcoal salt, and is now the
  logo for my Dad's business.  I'm making T-shirts for it and wanted to use the same
  font for the family members individual shirts.  Guessing that it was handwritten,
  and my research has come up with these close ones.  Tantine Script-Bold (FontFontFF),
  Freehand 521 (Bitstream Freehand) and Freehand 575.  I think 521 was the closest
  for my eyes except for the \"k\".  I'm just looking for a font that has all the
  same style in the letters from the logo \"Sparks'\".   Any help would be greatly
  appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/index_r1_c1_5908.gif]\r\n\r\n[http://www.Sparkslocksmith.com]"
