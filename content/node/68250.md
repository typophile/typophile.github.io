body: "Hi folks! Hope you can help me out with this one. Omni Hotels seems to be changing
  up their logos a bit; whereas the old ones were all set in Goudy Old Style and had
  the hotel name or location in line with 'Omni' and their hibiscus mark, it looks
  like they're moving toward having the hotel name and/or location set underneath
  Omni Hotels. Here's a sliced and diced pic of the text that appears in one hotel's
  logo:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wtf_3418.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny and all
  help is greatly appreciated!"
