  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi :)
i&rsquo;ve stumbled upon this site that contains several [[blackletter]] faces by [[manfred klein]] and apparently more designers.
usually I&rsquo;m very cautious of downloading free fonts because they are not always designed well. I&rsquo;m not so familiar with klein&rsquo;s work or reputation, and i just wanted to ask out of curiosity, what do you think about the faces in this site:
<a href="http://moorstation.org/typoasis/blackletter/index.htm">http://moorstation.org/typoasis/blackletter/index.htm</a>
are they well designed, what do you think about the designer etc.
thanks
Yaron.</div>

<p>actually have a look at <a href="http://www.fraktur-mon-amour.com/">http://www.fraktur-mon-amour.com/</a>, inclunding manfed kleins revivals and other great blackletter … its german, doooh  but you get a cd with around 300 FREEfonts collect and/or made for the book  -  dont know this &ldquo;manfred&rdquo; guy, but i think he is cool …</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Manfred has some of the most wonderful free fonts on the internet. He also has, by far, the most free fonts on the internet. Wading through it and finding what works for you could take a very long, long, time. And his commercial use terms are very reasonable:</p>
<p>They are even free for commercial use – but if there’s any profit, please make a donation to organizations like“Doctors Without Borders”.</p>
<p><a href="http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein/index.htm">http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein/index.htm</a></p>
<p>Admittedly he has just quickly finished some fonts off that were sitting around half-finished for years, kind of dusting out the cobwebs of his lifework. But some got his full attention, and when you come upon those, it is a joy.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em> is there a blackletter face suitable and readable for long texts?</em></p>
<p>No, there is not, at least not in digital format. There are lots in metal, if you want to hand-set the long texts yourself ;-)</p>
<p>On a more serious note, the reason that there really aren&rsquo;t any suitable digital faces is because the historical designs that were digitized were mostly based off of their display cuts, and not their text cuts, because at the time of the digitization, the days of blackletter text were over. Sort of an unending eycle, I guess. I&rsquo;ve spent some time off and on over the last two years trying to make a readable textura—one optimized for text! But at the moment that is still sort of a pipe dream, because I am not a good type designer.</p>

<p>Thank you, but no. Sorry. :(
I&rsquo;m working on two other projects that I have to finish first. During the summer I hope to pick it up again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>this face is beautiful and interesting although hard to read.

<p>Thank you. I spent more effort trying the make the forms legible in small sizes, rather than readable. A form has to even appear correctly in its given size before it can be identified. One of the many problems…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Not yet. But there could be, assuming readers

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that it is the readers at all! Rather, it is the clients. And worst, other designers and their dogmatic opinions.</p>
