  cards?  The font seems to be Helvetica with the tracking ratcheted up quite a bit,
  but I'm having trouble replicating the contact information side, which has a considerable
  amount of negative space and doesn't seem to be quite Helvetica.  Any help appreciated,
  and I'm not married to Helvetica so other typeface suggestions very welcomed.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    thread</a>, instead of starting a new one.\r\nAs I said before, the sample is
    too small (for me) to ID the typeface. Note that (Neue) Helvetica has a wide number
    of weights, including <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1266/neuehelvetica-family.html\">Light,
    Thin and Ultralight</a>. That said, mind that very light text set white on color
    is not a good idea. \r\nF"
