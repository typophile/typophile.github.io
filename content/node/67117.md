  body: "I isolated the letters of the type in the linked image in Photoshop and saved
    them back as a JPG.  Then using teh \"WhatTheFont\" tool at MyFonts.com, I found
    one font with four possible weights/variants for it:\r\n\r\n1. http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/harlow-sh/solid-regular/
    - Harlow Solid SH Regular\r\n2. http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/harlow/solid/
    - Harlow ICG Solid\r\n3. http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/harlow/solid/ -
    Harlow Solid\r\n4. http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/harlow/solid-plain/ - Harlow
    Solid Plain\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see, they're a pretty close fit.  Unfortunately,
    they're not a exact fit since the image's font has a very clean cut to the edges
    and ends of the letters while Harlow is very rounded.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone else
    can find a better match.  :)\r\n\r\nEdit: Looks like Mark and I found the same
    thing.  Though comparing the two, Harlow's rounded while the original's font isn't."
