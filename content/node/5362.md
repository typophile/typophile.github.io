body: When designing round uppercase characters such as &#34;O&#34; and &#34;C&#34;
  and &#34;Q&#34;, should the extensions beyond the base- and caplines be proportionate
  to the average width of all characters in the set?  I&#39;m working on an especially
  skinny &#34;O&#34; &#40;the width of which will apply to all characters more or
  less uniformly throughout the entire font&#41; and I&#39;m not sure if base-30 and
  cap&#43;30 is too much.  Any ideas?

  body: I don&#39;t know if you can say such and such is a good number for overshoot.
    But 30 seems a bit much for a 1000 unit per em setup, how big is your em square?
    <BR> <BR>Generally I think the intended point size has more bearing on the overshoot
    than the width of alphabet. The smaller the intended point size &#40;or longer
    the viewing distance&#41; the greater the overshoot &#40;I think&#41;. <BR> <BR>Let
    us see :-&#41;

    I think you&#39;re right, 30 probably is a bit much.  Ultimately, I think somewhere
    between 20 and 25 is going to work best for this face.  I was just curious if
    some kind of &#34;proportional standard&#34; existed that I wasn&#39;t aware of.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for your input Randy.

  body: 'Here&#39;s an interesting historical tidbit on this matter. <BR> <BR>In a
    footnote in his translation of Fournier&#39;s <i>Manuel Typographique</i>, Harry
    Carter &#40;Matthew&#39;s father, for those who didn&#39;t know&#41; points out
    this rule of thumb: <BR> <BR>&#34;To satisfy the eye a 6-pt. o has to be about
    one-eighth taller than the x, a 12-pt. one-twelfth, a 36-pt. one-fifteenth, and
    a 72-pt. one-eighteenth. The amount of difference required varies with the degree
    of extension of the type and shape of the shading.&#34; [<i>Fournier on Typefounding</i>,
    pg. 148, Darmstadt 1995 facsimile edition] <BR> <BR>By these last two, I think
    HC may be talking about relative width &#40;extended v. condensed&#41; and the
    type &amp; degree of contrast &#40;oldstyle v. modern, etc.&#41;. But, unfortunately
    he does not elaborate. <BR> <BR>So, Randy is right, the smaller the intended size,
    the more overshoot; the larger the size, the less overshoot. If you survey a number
    of typefaces, I think you&#39;ll find a reasonable average on a 1000 em square
    is in the range of 12-18 units. <BR> <BR>It is also my experience &#40;albeit
    limited in this area&#41; that a condensed type may tolerate a little less overshoot
    than an equivalent regular width. Presumably the reason for this is that as you
    condense a round character, it tends to become more oblong &#40;even approaching
    squarish&#41; and with proportionately more of the curve coinciding with the baseline
    or x-height, the optical disparity is reduced somewhat. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

  body: 'Good point Kent. <BR> <BR>Much also depends on whether the face is a sans
    or serifed. <BR> <BR>And the weight of the stems. <BR> <BR>If you have a very
    light sans, UNDERshoot of O etc. would, in theory, be called for! <BR> <BR>Standard
    ratios and rules of thumb are not much use if one departs from the limited class
    of type that Fournier presupposes, although his general principal is sound. Use
    the Force. I mean, the best method is to try some variations, print them out,
    and see which &#34;satisfies the eye&#34;. '
