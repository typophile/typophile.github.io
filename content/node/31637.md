  game. I've never designed for on-screen before, and was hoping for some advise on
  how best to use type in this format.\r\n\r\nIt is a fast pace racing game I'm designing
  for and the interface should project the semiotics of a fast expensive sports car.
  Does anyone know of a font the has this feel yet will render well on-screen?"

    (or others) that will develop a solution for you. As it stands now. If you purchase
    a commercial font system 1. its probably not licensed for embedded products such
    as video games 2. and the font is not designed for television screens (a serious
    problem). \r\n\r\nSo at the minimum thing you need to consider is if font vendor
    is willing to sell you an embedding license if a custom type is too expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "I don't think you have to restrict your inquiries to large (if that is the
    term) font companies. Any type designer working seriously will have terms and
    licensing for this sort of project. You will have to contact them directly, since
    this sort of thing is rarely handled in a standard EULA.\r\n\r\nBut do remember
    that it will be an expensive proposition, so a custom solution may be just as
    cost effective as a large commercial embedding license of an existing design.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "Depending on the platform/s the game will run on and type of rendering there
    may be various technical and licensing issues to deal with. \r\n\r\nWindows based
    games often include real TrueType fonts, installed privately or sometimes system-wide.
    Depending on the rendering techniques used, some hinting may be advantageous,
    but most commonly un-hinted fonts, rendered using full anti-aliasing provide adequate
    results at all but the smallest type sizes. Of course most games publishers understand
    that in these cases fonts need to be properly licensed, and coupled with the discoverability
    of unlicensed fonts in their products they tend to do the right thing.     \r\n\r\nOn
    other platforms, bitmap fonts are generally used. The outline font is run through
    a converter and a derivative bitmap font is produced using an OS rasterizer -
    often hints and other settings are respected. This font is then texture-mapped
    to objects including UI elements in the game. Because the actual source font is
    not included in the product, some publishers will ship these derivative fonts
    in violation of the EULA. More reputable publishers will acquire the required
    rights from the font maker. \r\n\r\nRegarding costs I\u2019ve found that in most
    cases license rights are cheaper than custom from-scratch work, but sometimes
    it makes sense to have a custom font designed, especially if it\u2019s a strong
    brand element for a series of products and will be used promotional material.\r\n"
