body: I am doing some research for an article on punctuation, more specifically on
  the question mark and the exclamation mark.  <BR> <BR>What I know so far is that
  the question mark first appeared on some manuscripts as early as the seventh and
  eighth centuries. I have also seen a printed sample from the 15th century &#40;1495&#41;
  that has a small question mark. I am also aware that by the end of the 18th century
  the rules of modern English punctuation were more or less established.  <BR> <BR>What
  I am really interested in finding out is if the original use of the marks was the
  same as it is today, and how the shape of the marks developed. &#40;In some ways
  the shape of the question mark is similar to an inverted semicolon, a mark, seen
  in the 8th century, used to mark a pause halfway between the comma and semicolon.&#41;
  <BR> <BR>I was wondering if someone could recomend sources, or possible places to
  start researching the origin of the shapes of these marks and the original meaning
  they might have had.

  body: 'One very valuable book here is &#34;Pause and effect: an introduction to
    the history of punctuation in the West&#34; by M B Parkes &#40;thanks to John
    Downer for mentioning it on the TD list a while back&#41;. I once copied some
    short sections of it - here&#39;s some stuff: <BR>- The exclamation mark first
    appeared in the second half of the 14th century. <BR>- The book doesn&#39;t give
    a firm date about the first appearance of the question mark &#40;except to say
    that the Castillian practice of a leading inverted question mark started in the
    18th century&#41;, but it seems to imply that it was during the middle ages. <BR>-
    An interesting aside: there was once a special question mark for rhetorical questions
    - one flipped horizontally &#40;&#34;facing&#34; right instead of left&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Also, I remember some Typo-L members once pointing out that the exclamation
    comes from the two cap letters &#34;I&#34; and &#34;O&#34;, while the question
    mark comes from &#34;Q&#34; and &#34;O&#34;? Not sure. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Dyana,
    that book sounds interesting! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I think his exact words were &#34;the exclamation mark is a contraction -
    i and o, from latin io &#40;take note&#41;.&#34; <BR> <BR>I would post his name
    here as well, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s right etiquette.

    <BR> <BR>Unless, presumably, it was a rhetorical question in Arabic. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Karen, thanks. <BR> <BR>&#62; I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s right etiquette.
    <BR> <BR>In my book, anything from a totally public discussion group &#40;like
    Typo-L&#41; is always fair game. And if you&#39;re close enough to a given person
    to know if he&#39;d mind or not, and you think he wouldn&#39;t, then anything
    that&#39;s most probably not very private &#40;like a general-interest post on
    the ATypI list&#41; is fine too. Formal protocol isn&#39;t very human. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    it was a rhetorical question in Arabic <BR> <BR>:-&#62; <BR>Hmmm. If a phrase
    in Arabic with some intermixed English &#40;at the end?&#41; ends in a flipped
    question mark, is it rhetorical or not? What if the last thing in the phrase is
    an Arabic &#40;I mean Arabic Arabic&#41; number? And since we don&#39;t have the
    luxury of using a flipped question mark here, could <i>those</i> be rhetorical
    questions? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Hrant, thanks for the book reference! <BR> <BR>I was able to track down the
    discussion on the Typo-L list. &#40;Karen thanks for the exact quote&#41; I actually
    subscribe to that list but somehow missed that message. <BR> <BR>I have also found
    a large list of books in the bibliography of Ellen Lupton&#39;s exhibition catalogue
    &#34;Period Styles: A History of Punctuation.&#34; Not sure which ones discuss
    the question and exclamation marks, but the books you guys supplied will give
    me a good starting point.  <BR> <BR>Thanks again for the references!'
