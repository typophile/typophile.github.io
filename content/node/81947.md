  body: "1) Between the Regular and Bold the two rows are very different in stroke
    contrast.\r\n2) Looking at the overall, this seems like a font for smallish text,
    which makes the thins in the top row of the Regular too thin I think.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Have you gone and designed the ligatures before the type or am I missing something,
    I do like them though

    narrow when we can't see the rest of the alphabet and its spacing.

    Ill post some images very soon. Hope this will give you a bigger picture of the
    typeface. Thankyou

  body: "I've designed an fi ligature, at least if FontStruct.com fonts count...\r\nAs
    for ligature spacing, it depends on the spacing in a non-ligature letter pair.
    If the two letters do not touch, then that ligature is probably only good for
    artistic purposes (not necessarily a bad thing) and not for legibility.\r\nOne
    idea about ligatures I had (although I have never seen it anywhere) is an fi ligature
    where the dot of the i is on the outside of the f's hook instead of on the inside.
    Then there could be more spacing without widening the f too much, but I don't
    know how well it would work in practice.\r\nFinally, you should keep in mind that
    if writers and typesetters are concerned about spacing, they will probably avoid
    ligatures altogether. So small increases in spacing are probably not a big problem."

  body: Re Boumas, I think I could refute that (without citations for now). If Bouma
    goes on wordshape, I would expect familiarity to be a key component. How would
    diverging from the familiar assist in shape recognition?

  body: I think we may have a disconnect. Perhaps we attach different meanings to
    the same words. My understanding is that diverge means to separate. How does one
    diverge into similar? I would expect two different things to <em>converge</em>
    in order to arrive at similar.

  body: "It is my understanding that Bouma is about familiar word shape. Diverging
    from the familiar works against this theory. Yes, in your previous example the
    two words would be easier to differentiate, but in a singular instance, an st
    ligature would harm the bouma due to a lack of familiarity (I\u2019m sure we can
    all agree that more often than not, people don\u2019t use st ligatures). The only
    way your example would hold true in a bouma context would be if in <em>all</em>
    instances, one of the two words was traditionally set with a ligature, and the
    other was not. I do not mean in a single book, I mean in all books, for hundreds
    of years."

    task at ~72 points using words with and without ligatures would be a fun study.
    I\u2019d wager handsomely there would be no signi\uFB01cant difference. I\u2019ve
    actually had colleagues look at 72 point Times next to 72 point Helvetica and
    not notice a difference. As typographers we have an ridiculous response bias that
    we often take for granted. Similarly, if no one even noticed the presence of ligatures
    in a reading task, it raises the question \u201Cwhy bother fussing around setting
    them, let alone designing them?\u201D\r\n\r\n(How long did it take you to notice?
    Show this to a to a stranger at the pub and give them as much time as you like.
