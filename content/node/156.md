  body: Interesting article, but why do you belief Fleischman has done every cut by
    his own? :-&#41; Mostly 2 or 3 masters for different sizes were produced. From
    these the other sizes would be derived in a special machine - the Pantograph.
    <BR> <BR>Before this time, every broken ...&#40;I don`t know the english word
    - in german its called &#34;Stahlstempel&#34;&#41; to build the &#34;forms&#34;
    for the lead types have to be reproduced. - This means, the master design has
    to be rewritten! This happens a lot and so the font face changed or shifted over
    the years. Maybe to avoid to much such broken &#34;Stahlstempels&#34;, the old
    faces were cut with less detail or even other details.- I mean, it is possible
    that such differences came form a different type production and reproduction technology,
    and / or form a shifting in the cuts. Perhaps someone knows when this pantograph
    technology was introduced by the foundry of Enschede.

  body: The pantograph matrix engraving machine is a late ninetheenth-century development
    and was not used extensively in foundries until the early part of the twentieth.
    ATF, for instance, began using it in only at the tail end of the first decade,
    if then. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been reading _Typefoundries in the Netherlands From
    the Fifteenth to the Nineteenth Century_ by Charles Enschede &#40;trans by Harry
    Carter and based on the 1893 edition&#41;. There is some discussion of Fleischman
    and the work. I doubt that there would have been two or three master designs,
    or, for that matter, any definitive master &#40;other than ongoing carbon proofs&#41;.
    The size optimization was normally the result of the hand and eye correction during
    the process of cutting the punch. More of an intuitive organic process.

  body: Hrant <BR> <BR>I have read your piece several times now and I still don&#39;t
    quite understand what it is supposed to convey. There are so many variables in
    letterpress printing that given any five examples, you will end up with five different
    renderings. Ink coverage and ink accumulation, pressure and movement of the ink
    rollers, impression and makeready, previous wear on type, substrate variables
    &#40;surface and thickness - and, in handmades, variation within the sheet itself!&#41;,
    dampness of paper, weather conditions, etc, all contribute to variation, even
    within an edition run. Add to this the kind of press, the particular operational
    variables of the press, and the rational of the work &#40;fine press, commercial,
    get-it-out-this-afternoon, etc&#41;. And this is all yet ignoring the experience,
    approach, and attitude of the pressman. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t see how this can
    convey useful information on type design. Certainly some historical printers may
    have been concerned with rendering the type design exactingly, but rarely in the
    commercial sphere.  <BR> <BR>Fournier&#39;s famous remark, &#34;it is not right
    to blame the letter for the fault of the ink,&#34; is probably indicative. Once
    the type was cast and ink applied, it&#39;s completely out of the punchcutter&#39;s
    hands.

  body: 'Fleischman was way before the pantograph - as far as I know all those fonts
    are one font: from the same matrices. Also, I think in each case wear would be
    nil or minimal. <BR> <BR>&#62; so many variables <BR> <BR>Yes, but it&#39;s still
    possible to ask some smart questions - because those samples were very type-conscious,
    and things like paper were chosen very carefully. Considering that in each case
    the printer was certainly very concerned about <i>exactly</i> how the type came
    out, I could validly ask for example: why is the 1908 the only one to preseve
    the <i>true</i> letter shapes? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Hrant <BR> <BR>Wear is never nil or minimal. It really doesn&#39;t take much
    to throw off the true letter shape, actually the exact opposite is closer. It
    takes a great deal of effort to preserve the true letter shape.

  body: 'Hrant, I just picked up on your question: &#34;So why  <BR>would Fleischman
    cut his head serifs like Jannon but his  <BR>foot serifs like Fournier?&#34; <BR>
    <BR>You may not have been speaking literally, but I thought  <BR>I&#39;d point
    out that Fleischman probably wasn&#39;t cutting  <BR>his serifs &#34;like Fournier.&#34;
    Fleischman was a little bit  <BR>older than Fournier and the #65 was probably
    cut  <BR>about four years before Fournier published his first  <BR>specimen. Somehow
    I don&#39;t think that Fleischman was  <BR>actually modeling his foot serifs after
    Fournier&#39;s work. <BR> <BR>But as I said, you may have been speaking only  <BR>figuratively,
    &#34;Why did Fleischmann cut his foot serifs in  <BR>the same manner as we associate

    necessarily, but the effect is more in the press operator&#39;s control, for better
    or worse. I would say, from printed specimens, that the roller provided a more

    complain that I read suggested that the pressman could feel &#40;the pressure
