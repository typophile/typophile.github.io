body: "i am currently fiddling around with some <strong>Open Type Features</strong>
  and for some reason cannot make the following script get to work after compiling:
  \r\n\r\nfeature solr { #Solarsys planets\r\n  sub s u n by a;\r\n  sub m e r c u
  r y by b;\r\n  sub v e n u s by c;\r\n  sub e a r t h by d;\r\n  sub m a r s by
  e;\r\n  sub j u p i t e r by f;\r\n  sub s a t u r n by g;\r\n  sub u r a n u s
  by h;\r\n  sub n e p t u n e by i;\r\n  # luminary\r\n  sub p l u t o by j;\r\n
  \ sub m o o n by l;\r\n  sub c o m e t by m;\r\n  sub c e r e s by o;\r\n} solr;\r\n\r\nWhen
  typing the letters in <em>FontLab</em> everything works fine, when typing the exported
  font in for instance <em>Indesign</em>, the substituted signs won\u2019t show up.
  \r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/ylxvpkz\r\nAny ideas what could have gone wrong? Thank you
  and sorry if this subject has already been discussed before. "

  body: solr is not a supported OpenType feature. If you put these substitions in
    another feature, like calt (contextual alternates) or in a stylistic set (e.g.,
    ss01), then you might be able to get at these things through InDesign.

  body: "Excellent \u2013 just replacing <em>solr</em> with <em>calt</em> (contextual
    alternates) is working. Thank you very much for the quick help. Btw. is there
    a list of supported OpenType features and their functions somewhere? "

  body: "You may also find this list in the official OT specification of interest:\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ae.htm\r\n\r\nThese
    are the registered features tags, not neessarily supported (yet). A bit techy
    but when I do OpenType feature programming I sometimes find it interesting to
    have a look at what the official desciption of the purpose and behaviour of the
    features is."
