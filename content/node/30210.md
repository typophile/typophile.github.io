  of the 1950s. My guess is that most British publishers would still have used a serif
  face (possibly even with oldstyle figures?), whereas American books might have something
  more modernist, maybe a slab serif or Franklin. But which ones?\r\n\r\nIf anyone
  knows of scanned images of such things, so much the better."

    would have been in <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/old-style-mt/\">Monotype
    Old Style</a>. You'll probably also find some in Times, Baskerville, Caledonia,
    and the other massively popular book faces of the day.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."
