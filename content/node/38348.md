    InDesign CS2 exports PDFs just fine... (and often more reliably)."

    has full access to the elements on the page (and their properties) and thus can
    easily convert them into PDF or PS instructions. But if you have to further process
    those files, there's a slight change that somethings won't be correctly converted
    (from PDF to PS, or vice-versa). What I'm saying is, it's better to get to the
    final format directly from the original, then through a series of conversion steps.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a real life example: http://www.typophile.com/node/21264"

    CS 2 also also allows you output using common PDF standards or to save custom
    PDF presets. If you find that your exported files are too large, you may want
    to consider what data in the file is likely to be causing the issue. For example,
    the Compression settings in the PDF Export Preset dialog will allow you to chose
    what compression format to apply to images as well as compress text and line art.
    It's likely that the preset you're choosing in Distiller just has different variables.
    It can be confusing. For typical design documents, I often stick to the PDF/X-1a:2001
    preset."
