  one that's set in a nice serif face, ideally with some contemporary styling (e.g.
  something like Fedra, or Tiempos), but I'm open to any good suggestions. I've had
  a look at http://www.bibledesignblog.com/ but he's a bit more focused on binding
  & materials than the typesetting. \r\n\r\nThanks for any good direction you can
  point me in."

    has a number of copies for sale.

    piece</a> for Fonts In Use. I think Whitman worked really well, but Karmina felt
    too \u201Ceditorial\u201D. The predecessor to this edition was typeset in Trinit\xE9.
    It\u2019s not contemporary per se, but it is one of the most beautiful books I
    own."

    and editorial needs.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI guess you mean a \"superfamily\" with
    two such branches that are on some level harmonious? Interesting idea. Specifically
    how would they differ, morphologically?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    religious supplies), you'll find a wider Bible selection than in a standard bookstore.\r\n\r\nDoing
    a quick Google I see at least one in the Oxford area \u2014 St Andrew's Bookshop
    \u2014 and there are probably others too."

  body: "Thanks everyone for your help. \r\n\r\n@bojev \u2014 The Washburn does look
    nice indeed, if a bit large. Definitely worth further consideration.\r\n\r\n@Frode
    \u2014 I actually remember reading that piece when it was first posted. That literary
    edition is gorgeous, and exactly the style I'm looking for. Now if only I could
    find a similar version in english! Do you know any place that sells the literary
    edition online? I've googled around, but haven't had any luck finding it. Would
    be nice to study the design of it even if I can't read it.\r\n\r\n@James \u2014
    Thanks for the tip. I've actually moved to London (I should update my profile
    :), but that can only mean my options are far wider."
