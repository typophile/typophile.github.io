  is for a site called \"I love my LBD\" (little black dress). It's a blog documenting
  street fashion, shopping, etc., but with a friendly tone and based around the idea
  that anything you feel comfortable in can be your \"LBD\".\r\n\r\nWe wanted something
  clean and typographic with a bit of a fashion feel to it, I had the idea of integrating
  a dress shape into the B and like that concept (if I can get it to work, I realize
  it's very rough right now and doesn't necessarily read yet). I like the slab serif
  for \"I love my\" although I'm not set on that typeface (particularly as it's really
  pricey), Gotham for \"LBD\" works ok but I'm very open to other alternatives.\r\n\r\nSo,
  thoughts? Does the basic concept work? Any suggested tweaks on the dress form itself?
  Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mylbdlogo01_6368.jpg]"

    is now, it just seems hanging out/floating, giving an unbalanced feel.\r\nThe
    idea of incorporating the silhouette of a dress is clever, but I think you should
    revise the execution. For one, now the dress isn't black! ;-)"

    the mark feels totally static and not flowing or cheeky, as I'd imagine the little
    black dress to be.\r\n\r\n"

    on the feel Ratbaggy. Any other ideas on getting the LBD idea across with a bit
    more style without being totally literal? Or is being a bit literal ok in this
    case?"

    more with the client and she says \"oh, by the way, I have these mood boards I've
    been doing if that would help inspire you.\" The answer is of course yes, so I've
    got that and am now evaluating different possible directions.\r\n\r\nThe best
    way I can describe the overall feel is elegant but accessible, lots of Audrey
    Hepburn and Breakfast at Tiffany's sort of imagery but wanting it to not be snobbish
    or elitist. So it looks like back to the drawing board, fire away if you've got
    any thoughts."

    shapes. It just comes off as cartoony. A solid wordmark that evokes / hints at
    the feelings from her 'mood board' is the way to go. Don't hit us over the head
    with a picture of a dress. Every woman's little black dress is different, and
    by trying to recreate one in vector form you'd be taking the power of each viewer's
    imagination out of the mix. In a sense, the letters should feel like a little
    black dress \u2014 elegant, comfortable, subtle and sexy \u2014 not try to look
    like one."

  body: "Ok, after working on another part of the project and more discussion with
    the client I've had some ideas for an entirely different direction and wanted
    to get some feedback.\r\n\r\nThe \"I love\" part of the title is really fairly
    unimportant, that will be the site URL but was used due to a more desirable URL
    being unavailable, so myLBD is the focus. She also wants an accessible look, it
    should look fashionable but not snobby.\r\n\r\nFrom there I had the idea of the
    \"I heart whatever\" phenomenon, the idea itself is horribly over used but I thought
    the metaphor of the heart for \"I love\" might be able to be interpreted in a
    unique way. I started working with some heart forms and playing with their intersections
    and overlapping and came up with this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mylbdlogo02_3665.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
    still working with the type at this point (and am very open to suggestions there)
    but I really like the form and think this could work really well. Thoughts?"

  body: "This is an improvement, however for fashion I think of long and lean. The
    font you've chosen looks short and squat. Try something in the Modern/Didone style:
    Didot, Berthold Bodoni et al. or a sans with similar proportions - tall, slightly
    condensed. \r\n\r\nYour new design seems like it is for a jeweler, the overlapping
    hearts form a crown. Only if you know they are hearts can they be made out. I
    do like the graphic, but if you want the viewer to clearly see heart/love my LBD
    it's not there yet."

  body: "First when I read fashion and looked at the image I saw two bra's, the hearts
    are pretty difficult to make out. I think the type could work though. I don't
    connect fashion with a condensed sans. I'd say the type should be an elegant sans
    serif. Something like Vogue, Ralph Lauren and Armani. Then I would choose a thin
    sans type for use on print products and webpages to complement the logo.\r\n\r\nThe
    recent version does have a jeweller feel to it though but I think that's because
    of the symbol it kinda looks like a jewel of some sort. "

    think that the logo should somehow say slim and tall. But my point is that the
    mark doesn't say that either.\r\n\r\nChris you seem to be doing a lot of logos
    for women lately! This sounds like a tough one for a guy to do, so I can't wait
    to see if you pull it off."

  body: "Thanks guys. I agree on the typeface, still trying to figure out what to
    use so I'll try those suggestions. I don't think it has to read \"I love\" at
    all, just sort of an interesting thing to work in there if the viewer happens
    to catch it. I do like the form a lot though, I think it has the right feel. My
    challenge is making it feel \"fashion\" without feeling too exclusive/uppity.\r\n\r\nI
    do see the jewelry feel now that you mention it, probably because of the diamond
    shaped mark that resulted in the intersection of the forms. That could probably
    be rounded or slightly modified somehow to be a bit less diamond-like."
