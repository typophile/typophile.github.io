    of my newer samples are larger, but the size was chosen to speed page loading

  body: What a lot of people don&#39;t seem to realize is that a script like the one
    posted above is not a trivial thing to turn into a font. The complexity of just
    those two words is beyond what you would normally find in a font. For example,
    <BR> <BR>&#42; The two capital letters are not the same height. <BR>&#42; The
    trailing letters--the &#34;e&#34; and &#34;n&#34;--would not work in the middle
    of a word, and the internal letters would not necessarilly work at the end of
    a word. <BR>&#42; The way the &#34;C&#34; overhangs the &#34;a&#34; would not
    work next to a character with an ascender, like an &#34;h&#34; or &#34;l&#34;.
    <BR>&#42; The connecting stroke between the &#34;o&#34; and &#34;r&#34; would
    probably have to be treated as a ligature. In any case, it is difficult to incorporate
    an &#34;r&#34; like that into a font. <BR>&#42; The connecting stroke between
    the &#34;i&#34; and &#34;f&#34; is wider than the others to make room for the
    crossbar on the &#34;f&#34;. <BR> <BR>This is not to say that some or all of these
    issues couldn&#39;t be resolved such as by adding alternate characters and ligatures.
    Unfortunately, users often don&#39;t know how to use such fonts.  <BR> <BR>For
    example, many of House Industry&#39;s script fonts have special characters and
    ligatures to overcome problematic situations. Yet, I often see these fonts used--even
    in design annuals--as if the designer had no idea these special characters existed.
    <BR> <BR>You can also design a script font in such a way to avoid features that
    don&#39;t work with certain combinations, but at the sacrifice of many of the
    qualities that give hand-drawn lettering its appeal. <BR> <BR>OpenType promises
    to make such complex scripts easy to use, but, so far, support is uneven. Yet,
    even when there is full support for complex fonts that can emulate custom lettering,
    it won&#39;t change the fact that if you want something unique, you won&#39;t
    get it by simply typing on your computer keyboard.

    logo of this product, which was a badly rendered version of Laser from Letraset,
    designed by Martin Wait. So, I just had to make my boss buy Laser and I spent
    more time in reworking and adjusting it to make it more &#34;friendly-logo&#34;

  body: 'Doyald Young, on his site &#40;<a href="http://www.delphipress.com" target="_blank">www.delphipress.com</a>&#41;
    summed it up well. <BR> <BR>If there are thousands of fonts, why handletter or
    modify a font to create a logotype? Because every company desires a distinct image
    for itself and its brands, which is unique and copyrightable, an important point.
    A custom logo is one of of a kind, precisely fashioned. One of the many design
    approaches, are logos that carry an identifying shape, or illustration. But the
    majority of commercial logos exist as name only and must rely on their letterforms
    to impart a distinctive image that the public will remember.  <BR> <BR>Commonly
    used fonts such as Times Roman, Garamond, Baskerville, Helvetica, and Univers
    are available to everyone, and because they are seen everywhere, their distinctive
    qualities are diminished by the boredom of repetition. These same fonts though,
    may be gently modified to create a more coherent and distinctive logo that is
    reproduceable in a range of sizes, positive and negative, and on a wide variety
    of surfaces. <BR> <BR>A custom logo, handlettered or computer generated, must
    address only the letters that the name contains. Each letter can then be designed
    for maximum compatibility, a less daunting task than font design, where each letter
    of the font: caps, lowercase, figures, punctuation, and special characters, must
    be designed as a harmonious group. <BR> <BR>Whether the logo is drawn by hand,
    or is completely designed on the computer, a thorough understanding of letterforms
    is vital for the successful resolution of a logo that is eminently usable, with
    a lifespan of 15 to 20 years. <BR> <BR> <BR>At his AIGA presentation, he said
    that drawing letters on the computer isn&#39;t drawing, <BR>it&#39;s clicking.

    <BR> <BR>This reminds me of one of the most dreadful events  <BR>I experienced
    in my career as a graphic designer.  <BR> <BR>At the end of my last year of the
    Applied Arts at  <BR>the Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent, I presented my  <BR>&#34;eindwerk&#34;.
    As I had been working as an intern for  <BR>FontShop for over half a year by then
    and was  <BR>freelancing since my second year, my presentation  <BR>consisted
    of all kinds of graphic design pieces,  <BR>all done on an Apple Macintosh. Computers
    had  <BR>just been introduced at the Academy by my last year  <BR>&#40;think Adobe
    Illustrator 3 and Photoshop 1-era&#41;,  <BR>and I had had exactly 2 &#40;two&#41;
    hours of computer  <BR>training in total &#40;which is why I skipped classes  <BR>and
    got that internship at FontShop&#41;. <BR> <BR>Now those 4 or 5 teachers are looking
    through my  <BR>rather extensive portfolio, and suddenly one says: <BR>&#34;Well,
    we can&#39;t grade you because we don&#39;t know  <BR>the possiblities of the
    software&#34; <BR> <BR>The world stopped. Here I was, ready to graduate,  <BR>having
    invested all my time and energy in computer  <BR>assisted graphic design for the
    past two years and  <BR>those guys who are about to decide about my future  <BR>just
    told me they&#39;re going to flunk me because they  <BR>were convinced there was
    a magic key on that  <BR>computer keyboard which said &#34;Nice Design&#34;?!...
    <BR> <BR>Lucky for me, my computer teacher who was standing  <BR>next to them
    replied: &#34;It&#39;s not because you don&#39;t know  <BR>all the types of brushes
    and paint that you can&#39;t judge  <BR>if a painting is any good.&#34; <BR> <BR>I
    graduated. FontShop hired me that summer.'
