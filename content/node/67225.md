  LetterPerfect offers some historical reproductions of tuscan fonts, like [[http://www.letterspace.com/LETTERPERFECT_FONTS/beata.htm|Beata]],
  [[http://www.letterspace.com/LETTERPERFECT_FONTS/donatello.htm|Donatello]] and [[http://www.letterspace.com/LETTERPERFECT_FONTS/ghiberti.htm|Ghiberti]],
  and that's just a good deal.\r\nJust wondering if there are other fonts with the
  same historical background.\r\nThank you!"

    own monologue telling me that Matthew Carter said that \xABOptima took its inspiration
    from Quattrocento inscriptional lettering in the cathedrals of Florence and Siena\xBB
    and that Arno took its name from the river flowing through Florence."

    and printer who worked in Venice, Modena and above all <strong>Florence</strong>,
    where he cut roman and orthotic Greek types.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4187284898_220cef8b96_5966.jpg]\r\n\r\n<cite>[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/bookhistorian/4187284898/|1482

    at some script styles such as Adrian Frutiger's <strong>Ondine</strong>, or a
    <em>rotunda</em> such as <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/san-marco/|San

    interested in. Anyway, there are some typefaces inspired by the works of Luca
    Pacioli and Leonardo Da Vinci.\r\nAnd, there's a whole \"tuscan\" genre! ;-)"
