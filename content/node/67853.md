body: "This is a poorly recreated version of the former MPLS Lakers' logo. I'd like
  to find this font, if it exists. As this was a logo created sometime in the late
  40s/early 50s, I realize there may not be a font foundry that has this exact font
  anymore, but I'm hoping to find something similar. I like the athletic look of it,
  and the fact that it's just a little different than most other athletic fonts out
  there. The combination of squared and rounded edges is what I like most about it.\r\n\r\nAny
  help is appreciated. Thanks-"

    was likely hand rendered rather) but will say that I actually like your version.
    The slight imperfections give it some charm. '
