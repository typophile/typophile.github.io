  tried to make it readable and usable at most sizes whilst still retaining an edge.\r\nIt
  also comes in several weights. This is the lightest weight.\r\n\r\nQ1. Which g &
  y do you think works best 1,2,3,4 or 5?\r\nQ2. Which one do you prefer 1,2,3,4 or
  5?\r\n\r\nWhat you must have in mind that it must work at a small size.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any comments.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-11_6182.jpg]"

    2 and 3 doesn\u2019t look so good in the small sample. So I\u2019d go for number
    4.\r\n\r\nQ2: 4. Second place: 3."

    thin fonts.\r\nThe regular and above all work very well at 5pt.\r\n\r\n@ Cristobal.\r\nGreat
    answer. Thanks."

    I like its g better but I guess it\u2019s a bit less legible than the other gees.
    The name \u201COctangle\u201D is a winner!"

  body: "In 1 \"q\" and \"g\" can be so similar in small text and its differences
    aren't enough.\r\n\r\nAlthough \"y\" in 2 it's fine, leave closer and better in
    4\r\n\r\nAnd 5 absolutelly not, cuz your \"g\" its so similar  to \"q\"\r\n\r\nThen
    I prefer 3 but 4 is more simple and clear to read.\r\n\r\n\r\nbetter wishes for
    your works..!!!\r\nPeGGO"

  body: "I agree that line 3, y and g is the most legible at smaller size, because
    y and g is more define and more friendly. and I can recognize the letter faster
    than other at smaller size.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, I think this should be a display
    typeface in bigger size, because it has a lot of interesting little elements,
    like little finial extended out, little cut, little angle, if it sets at smaller
    size, you'll loose all of that goodies. Beside, it's very thin to set at smaller
    size."

    everything was taken on board, and in the end I went for 4 with the second option
    of the double story g as an alternative by pressing the '\xA7' key.\r\n\r\nCovers
    all bases, and keeps the best options available."

    to use this font. If I press \u2018\xA7\u2019, I expect to get \u2018\xA7\u2019,
    not an alternate \u2018g\u2019. \r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s another (double) story\u2026

  body: "@ Cristobal.\r\nThanks for your comments, but in the 22 years I've been a
    qualified designer I've never used the \"\xA7\" key on any job.\r\nI think having
    the double g is a much better option, it makes the font far more flexible, and
    in the end, improves its usability."

  body: "Of course, and probably this font is not meant to be used for the kind of
    work who would need a <em>\xA7</em> sign.\r\n\r\nI am just saying that it implies
    an additional bit of care. You can write <em>ti\xA7er</em> and actually get <em>tiger</em>.
    Fine. But, if at some moment you decide to substitute the font, you will get plain
    <em>ti\xA7er</em>. No problem if it\u2019s just a word, but if it is a paragraph,
    or some words here and there, you may not notice the change until too late.\r\n\r\nSo
    I\u2019d rather go for an alternate font called NCD Octangle Alt or something
    that includes this double story <em>g</em> in the <em>g</em> slot. Or OT stylistic
    alternates (a related problem [[http://www.typophile.com/node/61530|here,]] though)."

  body: "Ah, that makes things a lot clearer, and point most definitely taken on board.\r\n\r\nYou're
    right, there's no point trying to cram it all into one font.\r\nWhen there's more
    money to be made, with two versions to buy.\r\n\r\nThis is the thinnest in the
    family.\r\nSo NCD Octagonal 10 Alts will be drafted,\r\nalthough there are 8 different
    weights in the whole Family going up to 80.\r\nSo 8 new 'ALTS' versions in total.\r\n\r\nYou've
    just changed my whole set-up in the way I perceive alternative glyphs.\r\nFor
    the better I might add.\r\n\r\nmany thanks"
