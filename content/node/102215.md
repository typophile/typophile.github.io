  Frutiger 1450</a> released by Monotype.  I've also seen that they have published
  an article : \"<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/en/6990/din1450.html\">DIN 1450
  \u2013 the German standard on legibility of texts</a>\" which could be seen as a
  marketing argument to justify, and sell this 1450 serie. (Maybe I'm wrong?).\r\n\r\nI've
  seen some tough feedbacks on Twitter  today by some weel known and hi-skilled type
  designers :\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"fr\"><p>The typeface

  I would like to have more feedbacks  (140 char. is really short), more opinions
  about this typeface.\r\nWhat you think about the font itself ?  The need of such
  release ?  The legibility issue ?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    do need everything written down in DIN for the sake of safety and in case of claiming
    damages. To put a German wordplay i\u2019d say that the Frutiger type has not
    \u201EverDINt\u201C (= deserved) this treatment. And i am very sure that Adrian
    Frutiger would have not approved this. He wanted his shapes \u2039naked\u203A
    and sharp as arrows. Sadly, he is suffering from illness and can\u2019t defend
    himself any longer."

  body: "Good. The thing is: the Frutiger type is one of Linotype\u2019s best selling
    typefaces and it is widely used in circumstances where bureaucrats might point
    out that in a given environment (medical packages or important signage) there
    has to be used a typeface that is in the DIN 1450 norm. So, now people who don\u2019t
    want to give up Frutiger have the choice of a Frutiger alternative which every
    lawyer can approve of. I am just assuming that Adrian Frutiger would not like
    this alternate design of his typeface very much, no matter how well executed it
    is."

  body: "Together with prof. Florian Adler, Ivo Gabrowitsch (FSI), Ralf Herrmann,
    Otmar Hoefer (Linotype), Peter Karow (ex URW), prof. Indra Kupferschmid and several
    experts on issues concerning low vision, optics and lighting, I have been working
    on the new DIN 1450. Please allow me to serve you with some facts in this discussion.\r\n\u2013
    DIN norms are not laws, they are norms. Their use can be enforced by contracts
    or laws, but that is subject to business- or political discussions and decisions.\r\n\u2013
    DIN is not stately-owned, the DIN norms are defined by its committee members.
    It is up to the designers and their organisations to either leave that work up
    to bureaucrats, other specialists, fellow-designers or to take a seat in a DIN
    committee \u2026\r\n\u2013 Unlike the previous version, DIN 1450 does not prescribe
    the use of sans serif typefaces for almost any kind of typography. In the informative
    section, the new DIN 1450 recommends the use of sans serif typefaces for public
    signage, but not for any text in the public space.\r\n\u2013 DIN 1450 does not
    prescribe the use of Frutiger, let alone Neue Frutiger or Neue Frutiger 1450.
    Frutiger is included in a list of typefaces which are mainly recommended for signage.
    Frutiger 1450 has not been included in that lists, because at the time DIN 1450
    was approved by the committee, Frutiger 1450 was not available and maybe even
    not planned for yet.\r\n\u2013 DIN 1450 does not include a specific typeface design
    (such as DIN 1451 on typefaces does, it includes DIN 1451 Mittelschrift and DIN
    Engschrift).\r\n\u2013 DIN 1450 does not prescribe the use of sans serif typefaces
    for medical packages or medical information leaflets.\r\n\u2013 DIN 1450 distinguishes
    between several kinds of texts: Display text, reading text, caption / consultatory
    text, signage. For each kind of text an appropriate range of sizes has been defined.
    Type sizes are referred to by the x-height in mm, related to typical viewing distances.
    Appropriate typefaces for these kind of texts are indicated by ranges for aspects
    such as stroke weights and counter width in percentages related to their x-height.
    Display typefaces are not subject to any requirements, except for a minimum x-height.\r\n\u2013
    Next to the normative part, DIN 1450 has an informative section. For signage,
    the list of recommended typefaces shows a clear preference for Humanist Sans Serif
    and Grotesque (and not for Geometric Sans and Neo-Grotesque)*.  The list includes
    includes Calibri, Frutiger, Myriad, Thesis \u2013The Sans, Verdana and Wayfinding
    Sans, just to name a few.\r\n\u2013 DIN 1450 does not prescribe a seriffed-one,
    a zero-with-dot or a crooked-l. In the informative section it is recommended to
    use these kind of variations when means of positioning or indication (i.e. typography
    and/or context) fail. Note that most traffic sign systems have been designed in
    such a way that ambiguity between letters and figures is virtually impossible.
    Let alone most documents. Ambiguity is likely to occur in IBAN and BIC codes,
    captchas and other nerdy inventions.**\r\n\r\n* I would rather recommend FontShop\u2019s
    FontBook app to figure out what typefaces belong to these classes than the current
    classification which Monotype uses on fonts.com though. To me, it is totally unclear
    what reasoning they may have followed to come up with the idea that, next to Frutiger,
    Univers Next also is a Humanist Sans Serif:\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/browse/classifications/humanistic-sans\r\n\r\n**
    In my personal view it would rather make sense to fight against ambiguous coding
    systems rather than wasting our times with slot-filling projects such as adding
    or substituting decent letterforms by the aforementioned poppycock. Unless for
    Designers\u2019 Reasoning of course. If I were Frutiger and dead, I\u2019d be
    rotating in my grave in turbo-mode \u2026"

  body: "One of the major changes to the previous version of DIN 1450 is that the
    new version does not anymore take the capital height in mm as a reference for
    defining type sizes. In the new version, requirements for type sizes are related
    to the x-height. This way of defining requirements for type sizes is likely to
    be adapted by other DIN norms in the future. It will also influence the way German
    legislation will be defining such requirements. \r\n\r\nThe EC seems to be heading
    in the same direction. The new legislation on \u2018the provision of food information
    for consumers\u2019 (i.e. packaging etc.) specifies that \u2018mandatory particulars
    [\u2026] shall be printed [\u2026] in characters using a font size where the x-height
    [\u2026] is equal or greater than 1,2 mm.\u2019 Regulation No 1169/2011, Chapter

    The typeface is a customized version of DTL Albertina :\u2013)\r\n\r\nFor those
    who like to think that it is not really possible to define the size of a typeface
    by its x-height, I\u2019d like to refer to the new \u2018x-Tools for Adobe InDesign\u2019
