  are not good.. I've tried to check them in many ways (redesign of shape, remove
  overlap, cleaning up...) \r\n\r\nThe block size is 75X75\r\nI want the font to fit
  8px in apps. like photoshop or flash.\r\n\r\nSetup : \r\nAscent =600  Descent =
  150  Em =600   (since 8x75=600)\r\n\r\nThe result is the same with Ascent+Descent=Em
  ie:\r\nAscent =450  Descent = 150  Em =600   \r\n\r\nThe only way I get it to work
  (with block still 75x75) is with that setup :\r\nAscent =850  Descent = 150  Em
  =1000 ...  but the font fit 14px and not 8 like I wish..\r\n\r\nsome help would
  be great.. i've been wandering hours and hours trying setups..for only an \"/\"
  and a \"@\"...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the one you are having.

  body: "I think you have to make the ascenders 250 and the descenders 750 em units.\r\nPut
    gridspacing (preferences) to 125en units, and align points to grid.\r\nNow your
    characters are 8 pixels high. This has to work.\r\nSucces.\r\nPieter\r\n"
