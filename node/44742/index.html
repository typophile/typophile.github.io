  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everyone, Ive a problem which im not sure whether this is the right place or not, but i thought i&rsquo;d throw it out there to see what people on here thought on the matter..</p>
<p>Right then, just so you know, Ive professionally been designing for screen based medias for 10+ years now and whenever ive done designs in the past, for say a new web site, ive always set the text in Photoshop that i intend to display as HTML type to &lsquo;aliased&rsquo; (or &lsquo;non anti-aliased&rsquo; to those that wrongly refer to it). This has been so that the client (and any other coder/designer picking up this project at a later date) can clearly see a distinction between the use of images and HTML type. I know that presenting a flattened .jpg this way is a massive presumption that the client will have &lt; IE6 since that browser cant render HTML type as anti-alias but it is, for now, still the majority browser&hellip; so this is where my problem lies.</p>
<p>I had my boss come to me the other day complaining that the screen shot i had sent him for prior approval (copy errors etc) wasnt &lsquo;the best ever we could visually provide the client&rsquo;&hellip; I was sat there with my anti-aliasing HTML Mac trying to explain the hows and whys of my actions before finding a PC with IE6 to demonstrate my point. I also had to state that his new laptop was running Vista/IE7 and it anti-aliases the type and thats why other websites on his screen looked really nice, compared to the printed out &lsquo;aliased&rsquo; HTML type version i had designed in his hand. I also pointed out that the low client expectation level is covered this way, and should the client have IE7 not IE 6 upon its HTML build then it will only look better than what i originally delivered as a flat .jpg screenshot.</p>
<p>and no, my boss isnt an art director, nor a senior designer type, hes the top level management company type boss so you know.</p>
<p>So anyway, my predicament is: should i start to anti-alias all my HTML example text in photoshop cos of IE7 now anti-aliasing? or stay designing the way i do??</p>
<p>any thoughts, advice or similar experiences please</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as simple as IE6 vs IE7, as I&rsquo;m using IE 6 on WinXP and have ClearType anti-aliased text. Surely it&rsquo;s a system-wide setting in Control Panel &gt; Display?</p>
<p>Avoid Cleartype anti-aliasing in screenshots, though &ndash; stick to Standard &ndash; or you risk odd colour fringing on others' displays.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I second the anti-aliased text call. In a very similar position to you I&rsquo;ve been presenting everything anti-aliased for years, though I never used to way back when. I&rsquo;ve been doing it at least as long as Quartz rendering on the Mac allowed me to believe anti-aliased HTML text was possible. What a revelation that was. At that time Windows couldn&rsquo;t do it, and later on (I think) needed a display setting changed to render anti-aliased Cleartype text.</p>
<p>Also, all platfoms now do anti-aliased text. Mac has Quartz, Windows has Cleartype and Linux machines using GTK have the excellent Freetype. [[http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/b/archives/2008/03/20/T13_47_17/|I do know of one outraged blogger]] who hates what he calles &ldquo;blurred&rdquo; fonts on screen, but I couldn&rsquo;t disagree with him more. These days there&rsquo;s also a tedious back-and-forth &ldquo;mine&rsquo;s best&rdquo; argument, exacerbated by Safari on Windows arrogantly using Quartz, often waged between Mac and Windows users as to whether Quartz or Cleartype is &lsquo;better&rsquo;. I have my own opinion, but nobody else ought to care.</p>
<p>Essentially I agree with your boss. Presenting anti-aliased text in your work will allow you to present type that&rsquo;s both &lsquo;better presented&rsquo; and, these days, more accurate. He&rsquo;s right, aliased text wouldn&rsquo;t now be &ldquo;the best ever we could visually provide the client&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hehe, yeah i know its 2008 im there too, believe it or not ;)</p>
<p>so thanks for the feedback - however, i cant help but feel like Im now left with the next predicament: If i anti-alias my typefaces upon showback, then it potentially opens up the old &lsquo;i dont like that typeface, why cant i have my company print &lsquo;Akzidenz&rsquo; font?&rsquo; debate.</p>
<p>Like i said, Ive always tried to show the design at its lowest possible &lsquo;pixel&rsquo; outcome since i cant predict that the client will have cleartype turned on (ive currently got a lot of large in-house clients who have an IT dept. dictate their machines - so theyre quite old and pretty preset from when they were purchased years ago) let alone know what cleartype is, hehe!.</p>
<p>however, i think ill test the waters and start to deliver anti-aliased based screenshots based on your opinions. Ill try and keep you updated as to what type of feedback i get ;)</p>
<p>ps. aluminum: why would you not recommend PS for client sign off as a bad idea?</p>
