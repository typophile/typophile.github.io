    - although sometimes that proved to be a false claim.\r\n\r\nI know of no digital
    version."

  body: "So close to Bullion by Face Photosetting (distributed by Letraset), it hurts.
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/bully-pulpit-plain-nf/|Nick Curtis did
    a revival of Bullion called Bully Pulpit, in shadow and plain variants.]]\r\n\r\nThe
    type in question probably is a VGC original. Definitely seen it many times before."
