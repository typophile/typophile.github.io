  <BR> <BR>This font has a limited number of uses - as you can see from the sample,
  text is not one of them. <BR> <BR>I used only quarter-circle arcs and L-shaped brackets
  in a rigid grid to create this face. <BR> <BR>The dingbats symbolise &#34;A Clockwork
  Orange&#34; &#40;where the text comes from&#41;. The gear is inspired by a cover
  from one of the editions of this book. <BR> <BR> - Lex'

  body: you&#39;re right, it&#39;s more or less unreadable, but it&#39;s also kind
    of rad. More in keeping with the movie than the book, but it&#39;s got kind of
    a Nadsat feel to it just the same.

  body: Yeah - I don&#39;t know why, but the face reminded me of oranges. Maybe it&#39;s
    the a - it kind of looks like a leaf that you&#39;d see on a box of orange juice.
    The angles make it seem more mechanical, so ACO seemed like a fit. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    thinking of making a lighter weight, and maybe a bold and a heavy. <BR> <BR> -

  body: The text in the pdf reminds me of a handwritten note in a strange way, however
    the m,v, w and the numerals  are really tricky to read. <BR>Tim

  body: You could invent one more rule or option to employ to open it up to more use
    or easier reading. I like it.
