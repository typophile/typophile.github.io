  of ligatures is released within 24 hours from MyFonts.\r\n\r\nI did not manage 2000
  ligatures, but there are al ot of more than just two-glyph ones there.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Suomi_4826.png]\r\n\r\nI
  have most of them in the pdf here:\r\n"

  body: The idea was to take my own handwriting and get it ITC'd; grinded and polished
    beyond recognition. It think I succeeded.

  body: Looks really nice! But why on earth are there no alternate S's or S ligs?
    After all, you have two cap S's in the name.

  body: I did think of ligatures for all uppercase, but decided to just go with those
    that naturally flows with a pen, so, with'S', I would have had to make a big loop
    to connect any other glyph.

  body: "And the fact is that I made this font in 2004. It sort of ended on a slow
    burner, when I got to 35000 kerning pairs, and FontLab caved in. It tried different
    methods, but FontLab refused to produce an OT font.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I had to
    remove most of the kerning pairs, and hope that people don't mind kerning by hand.
    I've already given Suomi Script for free to some that had been asking for it,
    and that is fine by me; they can use it.\r\n\r\nSuomi Script was a study of OpenType
    possibilities, and I found the limit in kerning. \r\n\r\nI could go and buy the
    program Tal Leming made, but for just this it's too expensive. And it might not
    work for this font."

  body: "Nice Font Tomi. \r\nI too have found that Fontlab has a cap on how many kerning
    pairs that can be generated with opentype. I think its around 10,000. I wish it
    was infinite.\r\n\r\nCan't wait to see what you produce next!\r\n\r\n-Charles\r\n"
