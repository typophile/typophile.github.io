body: "hi guys,\r\n\r\ni was wondering if people could help me compile a list of common
  words/pronouns from as many languages as people know. Kind of like Bello words but
  not just English, words that would be useful for a range of languages.\r\n\r\nSome
  examples:\r\n\r\nEnglish: the, and, it, you, who, he, she, why\r\n\r\nFrench: le,
  la, les, que, qui,\r\n\r\ncheers."

  body: "are you asking for pronouns, or all simple words, or both, or is it any simple
    common words, including prepositions, verbs, pronouns, and articles ?\r\n(\"the\"
    is an article, not a pronoun, but you must know more about grammar than i do.)\r\n
    \r\nwords which could be fun and playfully meaningful to visually emphasize ?\r\n\r\nthis.
    that. them. they. those. these. what. is. was. will. be. am. would. should. could.
    he. she. it. his. hers. their. theirs. you. your. yours. i. me. my. oh. not. but.
    a. an. and. any. ever. never. all. some. few. none. soon. later. now. yes. no.
    maybe. who. when. why. whom. which. of. in. on. by. into. onto. up. down. over.
    under. before. after. etc.\r\n\r\n"

  body: yeah it more along the lines of what Ch is describing, its for a script font
    so common words that could be substituted with something a little special. I didn't
    just want to add a bunch of english words, thought it would be better to add a
    mixture from other languages.
