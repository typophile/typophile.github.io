  body: "Hi Christopher,\r\n\r\neven a simple \u2018Gallery\u2019 would have made
    your thread stand out from the crowd. Alternatively, something like \u2018Sans-serif
    caps with low A bar\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s always a good idea to mention the source,
    e.g. \u2018Acme Gallery website\u2019.\r\nThanks!"
