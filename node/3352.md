body: 'I&#39;ve launched a new pixel font foundry. I&#39;m new to many aspects of
  the game, and don&#39;t know what to make of the site&#39;s initial performance.
  <BR> <BR>Last eleven hours: approximately 450 unique visitors, 180 downloads of
  the font collection pdf, and zero sales. <BR> <BR>When I published my pdf, I tried
  breaking the fonts into outlines. It didn&#39;t display as well, nor did it print
  as well as embedding the fonts. I&#39;m puzzled as to why. So I published the embedded
  font version. <BR> <BR>My question: is font exctraction from pdf widespread? I wouldn&#39;t
  think it is, but what do I know? <BR> <BR>My products could simply not be as appealing
  to flash designers as I thought. I&#39;d like to think that it&#39;s too soon to
  say, but, the initial stats have me concerned.'

    fonts. <BR>You have to build a rep over time, like Atomic. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Q. <BR>What do you do when you find a font that you like, but don&#39;t have
    an immediate use for? <BR> <BR>A. <BR>You download the pdf, print it, stick it
    on the wall and wait till you have an excuse to buy it. <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Tyler, you could always add a quid pro quo to the downloading of your PDFs.
    Meaning, request an email address. If they are looking to steal your font, changes
    are they won&#39;t give you a real email, but if they are sincere in their interest,
    I would think they&#39;d give you a real name and email. Maybe this would help
    the odds. &#40;Just a thought.&#41; <BR> <BR>Steve! I thought the answer was:
    License it! No wonder my debt is out of control. Hehehehe!'

    any frame of reference was driving me up the wall! <BR> <BR>Thanks again.

  body: The whole scare of people &#39;extracting fonts from pdfs&#39; is unfounded.
    If somone is this desperate to get your fonts, they will, and there are definately
    easier means to do it than extracting from a pdf. <BR> <BR>Another question, what
    good does a pdf do for displaying screen type? <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

  body: 'Kyle, as I hinted at above, my true feeling about consumers is not a mistrustful
    one. I do not really think that pdf font extracting is a widespread phenomenon.
    <BR> <BR>The reason I posted the question is really pretty embarrassing. I posted
    the pdf because I was afraid that the site design might be too click-heavy for
    potential buyers to view the larger portion of the font library. This, of course,
    points to poor site design in regards to the ultimate purpose of the site: to
    sell products. <BR> <BR>I saw that 180 users had looked at all of my pixel fonts
    at a glance. Embarrasing fact number two: I was dismayed that so many people could
    see the wide variety of decorative styles and not make a single purchase. <BR>
    <BR>Such was the faith I had in my untested &#40;in the market place&#41; products.
    I&#39;m still excited about the site and its launch. I&#39;m simply getting an
    education. Necessary, I know, but no less awkward for me in the interim.'

  body: Tyler, <BR> <BR>The amount of visitors, or PDF downloads has nothing to do
    with what&#39;s going on. Dude, you gotta show the fonts man! The only reason
    people are downloading the PDFs is becuase they&#39;re sick of clicking just to
    see the fonts. <BR> <BR>Your ability with Flash is great and all, but c&#39;mon
    6 clicks to see a preview of a specimen showing is just too much work for anybody
    to see a mini preview of your fonts. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re not selling your ability
    to make Flash animations, you&#39;re selling fonts and if we can&#39;t see &#39;em,
    we&#39;re not gonna buy &#39;em. You need to make it easier for a potential buyer
    to buy. <BR> <BR>As suggested above, you could certainly take a cue from Atomicmedia.net
    in the way the fonts are shown on the home page as larger easier to get to previews
    with a price and a buy now button. You MUST make your fonts appear buyable, your
    execution hinders this greatly and as a result your sales will continue as they
    currently are. <BR> <BR>I sincerely hope my advice it taken as constructive criticism
    and not as anything other than that. I&#39;m all for new foundry&#39;s being successful
    but I see some obvious flaws in your marketing execution that will hinder your
    success especially since you&#39;ve probably invested in a secure cert, a shopping
    cart and a merchant account. <BR> <BR>Good Luck! <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: Stuart, <BR> <BR>I take no offense to your feedback at all. Rather, I agree
    with you. Ironic though, as I put so much effort and resources into the current
    site. <BR> <BR>Sometimes, an idea doesn&#39;t show its real strengths and weaknesses
    until it&#39;s built. Definately the case here. I think I was too caught up in
    theme &#40;logo/naviation/product being pixel-esque&#41;. <BR> <BR>At any rate,
    I have to start thinking about how I can salvage the current design. I have some
    ideas, but am not over the fatigue of the first launch...

  body: With outline fonts, PDF has some real advantages. One can zoom in and out,
    and if you have an LCD screen, Acrobat&#39;s CoolType enhanced rendering is very
    nice indeed. <BR> <BR>That being said, it&#39;s not so exciting for a bitmap font
    AFAIK. It does mean that you can give people a nicely designed thing well suited
    to printing, I guess. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'Tyler, nice site. I agree with Stuart, too many clicks for such a small showing.
    The &#34;big reveal&#34; is a little disappointing. Especially when it is white
    type on a pale background. Quite hard to discern exactly the type. It gets a little
    tedious having to choose between the loose and tight versions as well. Could ye
    just lump them together? I don&#39;t think this thread was meant to turn into
    a critique! But I think you have some really excellent designs there, we just
    shouldn&#39;t have to drill down so much and so often just to get to them.  <BR>
    <BR>&#62;&#62;Last eleven hours: approximately 450 unique visitors <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t know about web traffic, but that beats the hell out of &#34;bricks and
    mortar&#34; ; &#41; Good luck mate! <BR> <BR>kris.'

    <BR>Too fuzzy. <BR> <BR>PDF would be a great way to show bitmap fonts too if there
    were a way to lock the display at 100% zoom. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: The navigation of mean tangerine &#40;aside from being, uhh, well we discussed
    this earlier&#41; is way to &#39;neat&#39;. I was going to go take a look through
    your fonts, but just the thought of having to navigate through the site turned
    me off, and I quickly left. <BR> <BR>Its a wonderful thing -- if you are not really
    wanting to sell anything. <BR> <BR>

  body: I&#39;ve been working on revisions to the site that don&#39;t call for an
    entire overhaul. I have benefited from this thread in many ways and don&#39;t
    mind the feedback on the site design and its flaws in any way. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t
    know if many of you will return to this aging thread, but if you do, here are
    two mocks of upcoming flash behavior. The first is a new method of browsing the
    fonts, the second, a new way of previewing, testing, and adding a selected font
    to the cart. <BR> <BR>I think this will  take care of access problems, but would
    welcome any feedback you may have. Say, for example, the horizontally configured
    scroll bar at the bottom of the drop down font menu. Too unconventional? <BR>
