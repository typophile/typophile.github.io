  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>hi all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with a logo for a clothing shop for women (mainly at the moment).
Most of the colours of the shop are red and the previous logo was the name of the owner in KuenstlerScript.
She wanted something charming with swashes and I think that it does work well with most of clothing she sells, however she also (when she has time) likes to design very modern dresses and skirts and stuff.</p>
<p>I asked her if it would be alright if I work on a logo for her as a part of a university project, which was fine.</p>
<p>Well&hellip;so I wanted to make a modern looking logo which would still have a swash to make it a bit more charming and feminine.</p>
<p>The logo isn&rsquo;t finished yet but this is just a first try and I was wondering what people here thought about it.
I decided for a very light font for her name underneath because otherwise it just took too much attention away from the logo.
I wanted the format to be able to fit on a tag (the things that are in the neck of shirts and stuff&hellip;not sure what they are called at the moment&hellip;(english is not my first language).</p>
<p>Again as always &mdash;&gt; thank you all so much!
dav2.</p>
<p>just made some changes to the whole in logo 4. (btw..I changed the size hoping I could add it with &lsquo;insert image&rsquo; but didn&rsquo;t work).
I have changed the type also to universe ultra light (I have been looking for different very light fonts because anything too bold will pretty much take over the whole of the logo).</p>

I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve noticed, but the &ldquo;inner upper curve&rdquo; of the f is not entirely aligned with the right vertical line of the compounding box (I hope you know what I&rsquo;m talking about). Anyway, just check the upper side of the f where it meets the box, you&rsquo;ll see what I&rsquo;m talking about.</div>

or was that rather sarcastic? =))</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&rsquo;t know which is the first post, but from Lex&rsquo;s comment I am assuming logo3 is the original and in terms of the monogram the most successful in terms of reading kf. It does need some refining, if you moved the f slightly to the right to take advantage of the more horizontal section of the k to make the f&rsquo;s crossbar which would also remove the nick from the red box. The bauhaus style is not really sympathetic to the logo and seems a bit of an afterthought, as Lex suggests you could try a script or you could go for a very simple thin sans (very fashion industry), Univers or Eurostile kind of feel maybe. I think your mark would look good as an emboss on that deep red. Is the bling version intended to be a die-cut which would be tricky even with laser but could look good too?

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;ve added a updated version..still with the later design though. Added universe ultra light (anything bolder would take over the whole of the logo). Aligned the &lsquo;kate fearnley&rsquo; with the left side of the k to the right side. I&rsquo;ve also been sketching the first logo loads of times now to make it look more like a handwritten autograph, but my drawing capabilities are pretty bad =)  Not sure about the line around though, but otherwise it feels a bit like everything is too empty. I&rsquo;m still gonna try and create a more handwritten version, though it will take a bit of time, but that was my initial idea.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just a couple of versions of the first logo (logo3). I&rsquo;m starting to feel like I&rsquo;m getting a bit stuck on one thing though at the moment..I like the concept, but I don&rsquo;t really know what to do with it anymore..I think I should just go back to drawing a bit to see if that could change things a bit more drastic. I could also send some off to my teacher, perhaps she has some more feedback on it as well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I liked the way the characters were integrated in the square in your first post&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->logo3<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I mean the bottom and top of the F. Althoug the top of the F doesnt align properly. I would take that one, to be honest, and put the name under it in a bit more geometrical typeface. Like Futura Light or something, and then maybe set in all caps.
Just to contrast with the icon, which would complement both the icon and the type.</p>
<p>But have you considered what happens if you scale the design to very small sizes? And what about embroidering the very thin lines?</p>
