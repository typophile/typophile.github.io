body: "I'm wondering if anyone knows of a utility/program/script that will examine
  a font's inventory and list out glyphs vis-a-vis codepoints (whichever coding it
  may use)? I'm noticing a lot on non-unicode fonts seem to have a lot of redundant
  glyphs scattered throughout the whole of the inventory and sometimes I can't quite
  tell if a font will be comprehensive and replete with everything I'm looking for...
  this is especially the case with legacy non-latin fonts that assign glyphs to <a>,
  <b>, <c>, etc, without necessarily having a systematic correspondence...\r\n\r\nthoughts?
  advice?"

    and OTFs. If it's not in there, it's <em>probably</em> not important.)\r\n\r\nFor
    just a quick-look on a font's contents on Windows, I wrote a little program myself:
    <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/52647\">SeeFont</a>. It shows all glyphs,
    with Unicode points where available, and can sort by Glyph index or Unicode.\r\n\r\n(I
    intended it to evolve into a complete OpenType examine tool but stopped developing
    when OTLMaster came out :-( ... and I also switched over to Mac.)"
