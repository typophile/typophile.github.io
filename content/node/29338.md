  body: "Your online version should be able to be easily downloaded and printed, like
    a PDF. You should also include a link on where to download Acrobat Reader just
    in case the person doesn't have it on their computer.\r\n\r\nIf you have an online
    portfolio, again you should have a downloadable PDF for people to print if they
    want to. It doesn't have to include every sample that your online portfolio has,
    but it should be 5-7 pages to give them a good idea of the type of work you do."

  body: "When I was trying to locate a design job earlier this year, nobody would
    even look at anything (portfolio/resume) that wasn't softcopy, and then it had
    to be in PDF or MS-Word format. So I put my portfolio of crappy student work online,
    and send out my resume as a PDF.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that you should never send
    people an editable version of your CV/resume. Although it probably doesn't happen
    often in design, it's not uncommon for recruiting firms to alter your resume to
    make a you look better to a potential employer."

  body: You should have hard copies too - people often ask you to leave something
    behind if you go to an interview. But these can be printed from your inkjet as
    long as the quality is OK.

    other 'creatives' prefer a nice looking PDF.\r\n\r\nPractical folks prefer simple
    HTML that they can easily scan."
