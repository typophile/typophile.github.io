  guess the subject line says it all. Before the weekend we released <strong>[[http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/meadow|Meadow
  Condensed]]</strong> designed by G\xF6ran S\xF6derstr\xF6m. A version that saves
  a little space but has the same character. Meadow Condensed works well on its own
  or as a family member. Character sets are identical, finish and quality is the same,
  it's just narrower to make room for more words.\r\n\r\nMeadow Condensed is well
  suited for strong headlines all the way down to small size settings.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text_meadowConde_4026.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nJust
  as the first release \u2013 Meadow Pro \u2013 Meadow Pro Condensed range from Light
  to Extra Bold with matching italics, in a total of 10 fonts. It come with Small
  Caps and a wide range of OpenType features, allowing extensive and versatile use.\r\n\r\nIf
  you already bought a Meadow license you can upgrade by simply subtracting you initial
  cost. Please [http://www.fountaintype.com/contact|contact us]] for more information.\r\n\r\nFor
  a closer look and  got to the [[http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/meadow|Meadow
  page]]\r\n\r\nDownload the updated [[http://www.fountaintype.com/specimens/65/original/FTN_Meadow_Complete.pdf|PDF]].\r\n\r\n\r\nhave
  a nice week\r\n\r\nPeter Bruhn\r\n[[http://www.fountaintype.com/|Fountain]]"
