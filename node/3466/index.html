		<div class="commentbody">The extra space, on a typewriter, is typographically functional in that it reduces the incidence of &quot;divorcees&quot;. That's the situation where you get the first word of a sentence, often &quot;A&quot; or &quot;The&quot; at the end of a line &ndash; which is something that I manually fix in rag right text, and in Web text by using a &quot;nbsp&quot; after the article when it is followed by a capitalized name (if I remember).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, a better explanation is that the widths of the points in a monospaced font are hugely wider, relatively speaking, than in a proportional font. So that the character sequence &quot;comma-space-lowercase&quot; within a sentence really splits it, visually, and is much closer in status, as a visual marker, to the sequence &quot;period-space-capital&quot; that denotes a new sentence, than in a proportional font. A double space compensates and puts back the degree of distinction.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, as far as I know, the term &quot;thin space&quot; does not have an absolute, universally accepted dimension (despite what Mr. Felici states). I've seen it just as often defined as M/5, or even M/6, as I have M/4. I haven't been able to identify if it had a specific defined value in the context of Linotype typesetting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, in Linotype setting (and also hand composition, for that matter) the spaceband is not part of a font of type. Lino spacebands go in a separate holding area of the machine and get inserted through a different mechanism than the characters of a font.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Linotype spaceband is a long, tapered piece; this taper is what allows the line to be justified and all the word spaces adjusted evenly to fill out the line. The thin top end of the taper defines your minimum word space; the thickness at the bottom end defines the maximum. I believe you could order Linotype spacebands of different minimum widths (and possibly even different tapers). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adding a thin space (however defined) after an end-of-sentence spaceband would ensure that this word space was wider. But that statement about approximating an *em* space doesn't make sense. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; K. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I thought that was odd, too. The book is presumably set using this spaceband + thin space method and the lines are justified right and left. On somewhat loose lines it does look like about an em (all the paragraphs appear to be indented an em). It may be that it looks wider because of the space above the period. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In any case, there is no explanation that I can find in the book either about why it's a good idea to have that much space between sentences or why a spaceband + a thin space is aproximately an em. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Perusing the book, it strikes me that the Linotype was a hideously complex machine to operate.

		<div class="commentbody">I guess I qualify as one of the oldtimers who actually worked on the Linotype machine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Linotype aside, in metal type days it was split school on the matter of an extra space folowing a period in text. My ITU lesson books stated that it was a house style. In some shops it was prefereed in others it was not.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At one time I followed the notion that a thin space added was the thing to do, just becuase that was the style at JW Boyd &amp; Sons. Now it jangles me to see an added space. To my eye, the white space above the period goves all the break needed. On the Monotype and in hand composition, I will drop even the word space if the next sentence starts with a cap T (on tight lines), and use only a thin space on more open spaced lines. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mark: You could indeed damage things on the Linotype or the Intertype with tight lines. The damage was usually confined to bending the tails on the space bands when they were forced upwards to spread the line. The fewer spacebands there were in the line, the more likely the bands were to be bent. Another resultof tight lines was the mangling of the ears on the matrices, whose function was to assure alignment of the characters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Very loose lines caused the slow buildup of typemetal on the sides of the mats at he casting point. The result was that  molten metal was allowed to flow between the loosely packed matrices and &quot;hairlines&quot; or fins developed between each letter. The longer these mats were kept in service the worse it got. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Take a look at the columns of text in any old hotmetal-produced newspaper, and you will see the hairlines. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There was a hand tool available for Linotype machines which was used to drive out the side walls of the hairlined mats so that they would again cast cleanly without creating fins. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim Rimmer <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;the spaceband is not part of a font of type <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks, Kent, that is interesting. Was the thin space also a wedge? From your observations and those of Mark and Jim, I am concluding that usually the word spacing in linotype material was rather loose. I actually like the relatively wide word spacing in a linotype-set book I have.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It may be that with wider word spacing, the extra thin space helped a bit to mark sentence beginnings - or at least that was perhaps the concept. Jim, do you know whether during the same period the practice of the extra thin space was something also done on Monotype machines? Did the Monotype technology generally result in tighter word spacing than the 'wedge' technology in Linotype? Or is all this extra space stuff just a hold-over from the practice with 19th century 'modern types', which Bringhurst notes? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Interestingly, these days in digital type the average word space built into a font is about 1/4 em (the usual range is about .2 to .3, but .25 is about average). So defining a &quot;thin space&quot; as 1/4 em is sort of funny, in modern usage, seeing as the thin space by definition ought to be narrower than a word space. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe that the thin space in InDesign is 1/6 of an em, which would be 2/3 of a typical word space.

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for this topic, Daniel. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have long been bothered by the double space phenomenon.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We were taught to do it in school, and even then, without any <!-- raw HTML omitted -->knowledge or interest in typography, it seemed senseless to me. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No book or magazine or newspaper I could find had two spaces <!-- raw HTML omitted -->after each sentence.

Robin Williams tried to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->educate the uninformed masses with her &quot;The Mac Is Not  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a Typewriter&quot; a few years back (&quot;The PC Is Not A Typewriter&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->came out soon after), but even a book that was marketed to an  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->audience beyond graphic designers reached too few. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is some hope.

		<div class="commentbody">Extending Nick's analysis, we get the following on the relation between word and sentence spacing. If the word space is say 1/4 em and the period takes up say 1/6th em, then the space above a period increases the total space after a sentence to 66% over a word space alone. If however the word space is 1/2 em, and the space of the period remains the same, then the increase of the end of sentence space is only 33% over a word space. So with looser word spacing, it makes sense to add extra space between sentences, whereas with tighter spacing it does not.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am not Jim, and have not operated a Linotype. Monotype yes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, in part this may answer some of your questions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your question. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim, do you know whether during the same period the practice of the extra thin space was something also done on Monotype machines? Did the Monotype technology generally result in tighter word spacing than the 'wedge' technology in Linotype?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thin space bands eventually cause metal fins. The same is true of wide settings on a Linotype. The extra space after a period however has nothing to do with that. Or, at least, was incidental to setting technology. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim and I have both indicated the extra  space after a period is a matter of &quot;house style&quot;. My words were, a &quot;bad fad&quot;. And yes, certainly Monotype machines had some bad fad artists tapping keys. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But for sure, dreadful typography could be set by hand, set by Linotype or set by Monotype. Just the same as in digital typography. Machines do not set type, people do. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Very tight spacing was possible with a Monotype, but not necessarily. Also it did not cause fins on a Monotype. Not the kind you see on the printed page. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The operator had exceptional control over setting text. Both variable and fixed spaces were available. Micro fine increments combined with the ability to unit add and unit subtract gave the operator the ability to do an exceptional setting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The ability to unit subtract meant you could easily kern on a Monotype. Not so easily by hand setting. Hand setting was a matter of very fine hack saws, gravures, and files. Great care had to be made in that operation or characters could lean, or work upwards and become bolder. However good craftsmanship is a wonderful tool. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That particular difficulty was not a problem with Monotype kerning. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But all this depends on the knowledge and skills of the operator and the &quot;nature of the craftsman&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But certainly, a slovenly mess can be made using any typesetting technology. And one way to be slovenly is to subscribe to adding an extra space after the period. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is a good book called &quot;The Finer Points of Spacing&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I wonder whether, in office typing, the practice was related to that other fetish: the addition of full points after Mr, Mrs and any abbreviation. Business correspondence is usually full of these things, and therefore scattered with full points that do not mark the end of sentences. Perhaps a little extra space was thought useful to prevent confusion where the full point was being used to do its real job? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't think this can be the origin of the practice (because it is obviously present in 19th century books, where my explanation would hardly apply), but it might explain and even to some extent justify its use with monospaced typewritten business correspondence. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A separate question: in earlier printing it was also customary to put a little extra space before colons and semicolons. Was this just a fad too? Is it ever justifiable? Because they rise above the baseline, I do sometimes feel that these marks are set a bit too close against their preceding text in some fonts at least at small sizes and affect legibility. I'm inclined to think it might sometimes be justifiable, since Finer Points (otherwise a great enemy of excessive space) reckons that a hair space might be justified in some such cases. I'm talking about a really fractional space, here, around 1/12 em at most, and I'm sure it depends on the previous letter. But kerning tables could presumably handle it.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">William <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think Gerald and Kent have probably answered most of your questions about spacing on the Linotype and Monotype. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me add this: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is not really a typical word space on the Monotype any more than there is on the computer in the setting of justified text matter (a book for example) since the word space spreads or pulls in at the command of the person on the keyboard. I suppose setting the H&amp;J's on a Mac allows one to have very tight or very loose ranges of spacing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the Linotype, as has been mentioned, the spacebands (long, thin wedge devices) have a minimum width when they are not given the opportunity to be pushed upward by the spaceband bar to spread the line out to fill the measure. If an operator left a lot of space at the end of a line, and there were only five or six spacebands in the line, there would be a greater amount added to each word space than if there were ten spacebands and the same amount of space at the end of the line. Whatever is left over when the operator of the Lino sent the line in for casting, is spread out by the spacebands. The same sort of thing happens on the Monotype Keyboard when the operator decides that the line just keyed in is complete.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->An operator wishing to set with tight word spacing on the Monotype would be conscientious in fitting the line as tightly as possible before punching in the justification codes on the tape. In either the case of the Mono or the Lino, the result is the same. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding the fixed spaces available on the Linotype: in addition to the regular spacebands, there are also available narrower spacebands that will give much tighter wordspacing. I am not aware if there are any other than the two widths. In the case of large type setting on the Linotype, say 18 point to 48 pt, the operator needed to add a correct amount of fixed thin spaces to each spaceband to avoid too skinny a word space. The linotype has fixed Mut, nut and thin spaces in the magazine, available at the stroke of a key. In addition there are  brass and steel thin spaces which the operator places by hand throughout the line of matrices in that have been dropped into the assembler box of the machine by the operator's keystrokes. After the line is cast, these very thin spaces are retrieved again by hand by the operator before the line is sent off to be distributed into the magazine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Monotype (in addition to the flexible wordspace used in justified setting) has the following fixed spaces: Em(18 unit), 12 unit, 10 unit, nut (9 unit),  8 unit, 6 unit and five unit. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By a magical manouevre by the operator it is possible to have access thinspacing as small as 2 units. This is a trick I have never been able to muster up the ambition to use. I did fall upon it accidentally once about 20 years ago, but have forgotten how it works. Too lazy to read the manual. I know Gerald Giampa is a whiz at the practice of thinspacing with the green justification key. This is a handy thing to have in the thinspacing of small cap lead-ins and in very tight lines where one needs less than a five unit space.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Summing it up: the Linotype justifies by a strightforward mechanical process of wedging out the spaces between two pre-set steel jaws (the mold vise). The Monotype counts off every unit struck by the operator as each character or space is struck. When you are at what you feel is the end of a line, you are shown how many units are left in the line for the spaces to take up un a revolving mathematical drum. In that regard, the Monotype works in exactly the same way as the computer, in that what has been keyed is computed and resolved. Or more precisely, the computer works in the same way as the Monotype. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Incidentally, there is a man in California by the name of Bruce Wasbish who has done marvelous bookwork using the Linotype. He once told me that it is possible to do fine books on the Linotype &quot;but it is excruciating&quot;.

		<div class="commentbody">&quot;There is some hope.

		<div class="commentbody">Jim , great explanation of Mono and Lino justification above. I wonder, however, how much sense any written explanation can make in the absence of seeing a machine in operation, unfortunately. I don't know that I would have really followed the Mono explanation if you hadn't shown me last year. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe at TypeCon this summer, we can plan a field trip  to Arion, or someplace like that, where interested folks can see machines in operation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Really? I'm all for letting users change the word spacing, but simply ignoring the &quot;default&quot; space that a type designer has (nominally) so carefully determined seems harmful. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think &quot;nominally&quot; is the key here. Hrant, you realize I'm talking about *me*, not the average user (remember, I'm an elitist ;-) And I'm talking strictly about justified settings. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The main reason for my comment is this: In justified setting, the default space built into the font is largely moot. It will almost never actually occur; the space is constantly variable. I think the spacing parameters are better driven by the type size and the line length and the leading. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I prefer time-honored standards (at least as a starting point) and generally like to have optimum spacing of M/4 or M/5, minimum of M/5 or M/6, and maximum of M/3.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, these values cannot be entered directly. H&amp;Js in Quark and InDesign are percentages of the font's space value. So I have to determine the value of the space in order to know how to set my H&amp;Js. For instance with Stempel Garamond, whose space value is 250, I might use 80/100/133. But for Bembo, whose space is 278, I will need to use 72/90/120 to get the same spacing.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Very inconvenient. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Does the Quark default affect letter spacing as well? (I have InDesign)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quark's defaults are 80/110/250 word spacing, 0/0/4 letter spacing. Notice the optimum word space is 110% of the font's space &ndash; how idiotic. When the line cannot be acceptably hyphenated to run at optimum or tighter down to the minimum, then Quark runs out the line. After stretching the space to 250%, it will start letterspacing up to 4% wider &ndash; even more egregious than excessive word-spacing! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I don't fully understand the intricacies of Quark's specific algorithm, so the above is a generalization regarding when it applies which decisions between hyphenation and justification. But the results can be atrocious, regardless.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't recall Indy's defaults off hand. But they are undoubtedly better. Plus, the multi-line composer can make better overall &quot;decisions&quot;. But these are still not beyond contesting, in my limited experience with Indy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Kent, why do you oppose the bigger spaces? And if they are to be varied at the discression of the person setting the type, what considerations would lead to a bigger or smaller word space? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->William, the case for close fitting has been made by Dowding and Bringhurst. I won't repeat them here. I remember not accepting everything by either man at face value (it's been a while since I read either), but I largely agree on this general point.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For me the bottom line is cohesion of the line and minimizing vertical drift across lines. The closer word spacing comes to the interlinear spacing, the less cohesion the line has and the more easily drift occurs. Acceptable word spacing is closely related to leading, line length, and margins.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The minimum is a function of the openness and internal fitting of the font &ndash; a wide, open design or a loosely fit font will not tolerate as tight a minimum.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I won't go on about this. I have work to get back to. Meet me at TypeCon and ply me with sufficient food or drink and I will happily talk your ear off. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; K. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Three related observations: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. It's easy digitally to put in-font kerning between a space and a glyph; in combinations such as &quot;rightdoublequote-space&quot; and &quot;space-T&quot;.  So there are some fonts with which a sentence break can be:  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;four.&quot; The&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->where there is kerning between all the characters from &quot;r&quot; to &quot;T&quot;! (Myriad Condensed has a lot of this sort of thing, if I recall correctly. And I've put it into some of my fonts also.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This a default effect determined by the font designer, not an option by the typographer. Does InDesign's &quot;Optical Spacing&quot; do this also? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Tolbert Lanston's original (1890s) justification system for the Monotype machine added incremental space between all characters, not just between words. He considered this a more sophisticated solution to the problem, however, the effect produced was not well received, so it was not put into production. Quark XPress had no qualms about making all-character justification the default setting, 90 years later.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. When a type designer is determining the appropriate width for a particular font, it's well to consider the amount of protrusion that horizontal strokes make in characters such as &quot;f&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, and &quot;y&quot;. Sequences such as &quot;r-space-w&quot; and the notorious &quot;f-space-T&quot; make the space less apparent (eg A Tale of Two Cities, set in Bembo: compare &quot;A-space-T&quot; with &quot;f-space-T&quot;).</div>

It was not abandoned. Very few used it. It was always an option.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There were two ways to achieve incremental additions, or subtractions to the width of type. One had nothing intended to do with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->word<!-- raw HTML omitted --> spacing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Using a larger wedge for a more open fit, or a smaller wedge for just the opposite. Not too much smaller or mechanical problems would show. Bruce Rogers used this feature for special book projects. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then you had unit adding, or unit subtracting. Monotypes were incredibly flexible. That does not mean all features were recommended practice for every job. Many operators never knew of their existence. Many others just never bothered with them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That said, I never remember too many operators habitually using unit adding or subtracting except on problematical settings.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A good use for unit subtracting is kerning. A problem readily solved with a Monotype. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unit adding would be used in instances where the operator was stuck with a sequence of unfortunate word breaks. But still, the discriminating operator would first search for a judicious use of unit subtracting often improving the setting of a line.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unless an unfortunate line length was forced upon the operator unit adding would be a very rare thing, except when all of a sudden the author of the text decides to go on a name dropping spree. Maybe rewrite the text or cause the author to suddenly loose his friends. Don't look at me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The wedge decision could have artistic merit, read Bruce Rogers' essay.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tolbert Lanston was a brilliant inventor, combs, horseshoes, window sash, adding machines etc. He was not a typographer. Much to his surprise type design was a bigger issue then he realized.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; In justified setting . . . the spaces is constantly variable. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is obviously true. In my experience with setting, the person setting the type must strive to come as close as possible to the most desireable space value. In good texwork this is generally thought to be a mid space (4 to the em space).  The use of hyphenation makes this task easier to accomplish. Those persons who hate to see a hyphen in text must have a tough time. I would strive for even colour in spacing with the use of hyphenation, than resorting to some of the moves people use today. One that I really cannot abide is the practice of messing fit the overall fit of the type to cram a line in or to fatten one out. Now this is just a personal preference, but I would much more end up with a baggy line spacing-wise than to see some lines stand out as black bars, and others as lighter lines.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know how far one can go with the adding of space between letters in a line, but for me it would have to be very little. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Goudy had a colourful comment regarding the practice of lowercase thin-spacing, but I am too much of a gent to repeat it accurately. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This thread is a good one, even if some of us have gotten a little off the rails about the space after a period. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think there is a lot of very fine work being done today with the current computer technology. The one thing that many need to address is the subject of spacing. Let's not forget that when a person makes a new type, the thing that takes the most time is it's fitting, at least for me it is. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim Rimmer</div>
