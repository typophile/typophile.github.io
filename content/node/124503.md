  series from the 90's.  Any idea of where I can look?

  body: "It's possible that older clip art has been sold to stock illustration companies.
    I'd search at iStockPhoto.com which is one of the biggest. On the results page,
    click only \"illustrations\" on the left edge to eliminate photos. You could try
    other companies too.\r\n\r\nAnother idea is to see if you can find via a Google
    Images search. If you find it, click it to see a larger version and then click
    \"search by image\" to find all occurrences on the web (to find a larger version
    or a company selling it)."
