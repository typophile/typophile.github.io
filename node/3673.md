  body: ' The lowercase italic does have some semblance, the uppercase however reminds
    me more of Nobel. Although even that isn&#39;t the same. But the feel is much
    closer in Nobel than it is in Metro, especially the condensed face &#39;Actual
    Killer&#39; above. WAD never designed an italic for Metro either, so what you
    are seeing above, if it is Metro is more of an oblique than it is an italic. '

  body: ' I believe that most newspapers from this era were still using the Linotype
    for their composition, though possibly not for headlines, which may have been
    handset or Monotype. <BR> <BR>Although WAD never designed italics for the Metro
    series, Linotype did release some. Undoubtedly these were developed by the drawing
    office, possibly by mechanical means -- i.e., obliqued. The italic headlines above
    bear some resemblance to the Metro italics, but there are some distinct differences
    that I notice, particularly in the width and aperture of the &#39;C&#39; and &#39;G&#39;.  <BR>
    <BR>The roman, all-caps headline is not Metro, although it, too, bears similarities.
    The crossbar of the &#39;A&#39; is too low. The crossbar on the &#39;T&#39; is
    too narrow. The angled terminals of the &#39;S&#39; are not Metro. A Metro &#39;N&#39;
    and &#39;A&#39; would have pointed vertices. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t say what it
    is, however. <BR> <BR>There were no condensed versions of Metro. The smaller,
    condensed headlines look like Erbar to me, though it&#39;s hard to tell at this
    resolution. Although originally designed for Ludwig &amp; Mayer in Germany, the
    Erbar faces did make it to these shores and were copied by Linotype. They were
    very popular for newspaper headlines. <BR> <BR>-- K. '

  body: ' You&#39;re right. The condensed font isn&#39;t Tempo Heavy Condensed, it&#39;s
    &#40;Linotype&#41; Erbar Bold Condensed. <BR> <BR>Only a few Linotype fonts were
    available over 36 point, and all of those were condensed. Erbar Condensed was
    one of the few available up to 60 point. It&#39;s quite likely that they used
    a Ludlow machine for headlines and the Linotype for smaller settings.  <BR> <BR>I
    mentioned above that Ludlow machines were similar to Linotypes, but they were
    very different in one important way: Linotype was automated and had a keyboard.
    On the Ludlow, the operator would handset the matrices &#40;molds&#41; for a line
    of type and the line would be cast as one piece. <BR> <BR>Ludlow offered fonts
    from 4 point up to 144 point, but nobody in their right mind would set a whole
    newspaper with one. They were mainly used for display type. I imagine they were
    popular at newspapers as an economical alternative to foundry type for headlines.  <BR>
    <BR>Obviously, Linotype could be used for smaller display type as well, and this
    appears to be what&#39;s going on in the sample page. '

    own Futura, so they had Robert Hunt Middleton do their own version. It&#39;s quite
    a bit different in the details, escpecially in the italics, but the overall impression
    is similar. Most noticeably, it has a two-story &#34;a.&#34; It&#39;s less geometric
    than Futura. In the lightest weights &#40;Light and Medium&#41;, the italics have
    slight curves to some of the strokes and even sport alternate swash caps, and

  body: "Yes, Tempo is one font family that I would someday love to see make a full
    comeback in all its glory.\r\n\r\nFor years, many people dismissed Tempo as being
    \"just another Futura knockoff.\"  But there are plenty of noticeable differences:\r\n\r\n*on
    Futura, the capital <strong>G</strong> has a full round body, with a relatively
    long spur; on Tempo the spur is quite short, and connected to the curve by a vertical
    line\r\n\r\n*Futura's lowercase <strong>u</strong> has an unusual \"upper-case\"
    construction; Tempo's is more traditional\r\n\r\n*In most (but not all) weights
    of Tempo, the lowercase <strong>a</strong> has two-storied construction.\r\n\r\nTempo
    is also noticeable in that it is one of the very few sans-serif fonts in which
    the italic completely differs from the regular."

    I am currently assembling a book for publication, and I am indeed trying to format
    the titles of each chapter to resemble headlines from the 1950s/1960s. Not being
    a typographer, this is all very new to me, but I do have a firm idea of what I
    am seeking. \r\n\r\nSo what I can glean from this conversation is that what was
    mostly used was a font called \"Tempo\" in heavy and heavy italic...? However,
    this is not currently available in a digital form-- only a condensed version in...?\r\n\r\nAdditionally,
    I am curious as to what the bylines, photo captions and main body of text used
    for a font or fonts...?\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any assistance I could receive.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRyan"
