:^)
Isn't it a matter of personal taste? I don't like superscript ordinals, and always knock them back to full-size on anything anybody gives me to work on ... but I have no complaints when other people make a different choice.


EDIT: Nick – presumably because of the lack of <em>any</em> ascending/descending numerals, right? So we won't get out of <em>that</em> mire until 2013...</div>

I would definitely not do old style figures with superscript ordinals. I don't think superscript ordinals were ever used with old style, and they stick out above them in an awkward way, to my eyes. 

You can use superscript with lining figures, providing you have designed superscript letters for the ordinals. Minion does have a designed superscript s and t, but here they look like fake superscript, made by the program, and are too small and light. 

Also I am surprised by the small size of the Minion old style figures. I never noticed it before, but the 21 looks too small compared to the "the" and the "st," which is giving "21st" problems when you have old style figures and regular lower case.  I don't understand this as Slimbach's Adobe Garamond and Adobe Jenson both have the short old style figures a bit taller than the overshoot height of o,e, etc. And I thought that was "normal". I think you are having problems partly because of what seems to me a mistake in Minion. (The other mistake in this otherwise fabulous font is excessive kerning of the quotes, IMHO.)

Microsoft Word's doing fake superscript ordinals with everything I think has put some people off them altogether. Mitchell & Wightman's Book Typography banishes superscript ordinals altogether (in English). I agree, since they seem to me pretty pointless. 

However, I admit that in some fonts with superscript ordinals they can look OK with lining figures, provided the program actually gives you the designed superscript ordinals.
