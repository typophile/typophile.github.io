  if I have a font called \"Calibre\" (totally different than Calibri). Since I don't
  have it, I was wondering if you guys can suggest very simular fonts.\r\n\r\nHeres
  a screenshot of Calibre's specimen:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/calibre_4079.gif]"

    with friends (a different form of benefits here\u2026), and a lot of the advice
    givers here are professional type designers, you should prepare yourself for some
    scathing remarks and answers.\r\n\r\n(Not from me, I don\u2019t design type &
    and I pay for the fonts I use.)"

  body: "Typographica.org has a good review on the Calibre typeface that should be
    helpful in your search... it would be useful to frame questions not only with
    \"what is similar\"... but also with: \"the design intentions to fulfill\".  As
    an example, Calibre is in a similar genre as \"signage\" types such as FF Din
    and Interstate...\r\n\r\nThe Typographica article is here:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/calibre/\r\n\r\nCheers"
