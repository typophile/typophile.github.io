  to see the ones with clearly Chinese imagery (the Great Wall, bow and arrow, toddler
  with Panda, etc.) juxtaposed with posters that took all their cues from Russian
  communist propaganda (workers united in exuberant cheering holding red flags).\r\n\r\nVia

    on it. I thought those were always for weddings and New Year's.

    Beauty's Castle mean that decadent capitalist propoganda got to me first?\r\n\r\nThe
    \"space children\" are fantastic!"

    the whimsy of the pets and the swirling rocket in the background.\r\n\r\nDana,
    what is the double happiness character? Can you point it out?"

      happiness character</a> is in the <a href=\"http://www.iisg.nl/~landsberger/images/csp01.jpg\">first</a>
      poster. It's the large, symmetrical character on the woman's banner. \r\n\r\nI
      think I have a red envelope with the double happiness character on it, but I
      can't seem to find it at the moment. Google \"double happiness\" and you will
      find the character on all sorts of wedding and New Year's ephemera."
