    been set by Photolettering in New York.\r\n\r\nHouse Industries bought the Photolettering
    archives, you might email them an inquiry."

  body: "I think Nancy is probably right about custom, judging from how well the 5
    and 4 work together, echoing slants and lines, but if you want an alternative
    font, look at the works of the \"King of Art Deco Fonts\", Nick Curtis. The closest
    I found was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/marrakesh-express-nf/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D48%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3D54%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dsingle%26seed%3D39|Marrakesh
    Express NF]], but La Coupole, Dusty Rose and Duesenberg all have suggestions of
    this number combination potential.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
