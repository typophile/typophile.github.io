  it I was about half way through and the professor told me to ditch it. I did, but
  I'm stubborn so I finished it off after the class. Its just been sitting on my computer
  since then. The other day I noticed it and I kind of like it, but I'm still unsure
  what to make of it to be honest. What do you guys think?\r\n\r\nhttp://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y239/Jumpsuit/scalion-1.jpg "

  body: "Interesting texture which makes a 3D effect, but you should keep the same
    perspective. It's not a good idea to turn the a upside down to form an e. Shorten
    the upper end of the t. Otherwise, an interesting typeface, no reason to ditch
    it. Well - I'm not quite convinced of the small bowls of p, o, g etc.\r\n\r\nAndreas\r\n\r\nPS:
    same problem like a/e with p and d - and I forgot to mention the m."

  body: Thanks for the feedback Andreas. You gave me flash backs. heh, this was done
    in illustrator and I was so tired of doing the line work the e was the last letter
    and I just said screw it, and flipped the a over to call it good. I agree about
    the bowls of the p, o, and g. If I was going to revisit (which I could depending
    on the feedback) I'd adjust those letters, amongst others.
