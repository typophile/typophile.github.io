  abbreviations like "LOL" had become popular long before there were computers and

  "&" and "at" became "@". What might they look like?'

  body: That looks lovely, Mark, but I wonder how well such a form would adapt to
    other contrast models? With a translation (broad-nib) model, you would get a lot
    more heavy strokes through the loops. As a form in this particular style, I think
    your 'rough sketch' is exemplary, but I'm left wondering what forms would be appropriate
    for e.g. a renaissance oldstyle type, a neo-grotesque sans serif, etc.

  body: "Part of my thinking is that it would be like the at sign, which for a long
    time had pretty much only one model based on the 19th century modern style. The
    at sign has that hairline loop in the early model which leads to varying solutions
    when type designers try to adapt it to other styles. In some cases, like adapting
    the Euro to older face, you get to rewrite history in a sense, and try to imagine
    how it would have been done had it existed. The ampersand is a good example of
    the range of solutions which are possible, not all of which are fully embraced
    by type users (e.g., the original and later Univers ampersand).\r\n\r\nJust for

    back in 1999, when we used to use those random glyph slots for ligatures and other
    fun stuff, instead of random mathematical symbols: \u2211 \u220F \u2202 \u2206
    \xAC \u03A9 \u221A \u222B \u25CA\r\n\r\nThanks to pop culture, we habitually included
    the \u03C0 - thanks to Darren Aronofsky's film - and the \xB5 - thanks to the
    early breakbeat of \xB5-ziq - in our types. If some hot rapper comes up named
    \"\u03A9man\", I'm sure that we'll start to see the Omega everywhere.\r\n\r\nIn
    a general purpose font - read: created for graphic designers doing general design
    work, not specialists setting math textbooks, which require far more specialised
    glyphs than those listed above - it seemed perfectly reasonable to fill those
    slots with something fun and potentially useful. And the design of the \"w\" lent
    itself to this treatment.\r\n\r\nA couple of the Thirstype fonts from this same
    period featured the glyph then being used by Prince as his name. "

    shorthand symbol that has become a sign distinct from the letters from which it
    is derived. The at sign comes from English (I think) and the ampersand from Latin,
    so language would not necessarily be relevant for such a thing. It's all rather
    academic, anyway. If one tried to introduce the at symbol or the ampersand now
    I don't imagine that it would catch on.

  body: "Hello guys, I am just discovering this great forum and already want to apologize
    for my bad english (sorry if I make mistakes).\r\n I am french and have been practicing
    calligraphy for 5 years but using computers for only 2 years (!). I simply don't
    know WTF to do to make pictures appear in my message, I almost tried everything
    & hope you'll get them.\r\n\r\n This WTF exercise is particularly interesting
    and funny.\r\n Here is what I would propose:\r\n\r\n - first, an exercise of simplifying
    the form into one single line, then drawing it faster and faster until it becomes
    something new...\r\n<img src=\"http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d133/Damidoux/Whatzeuf.jpg\"
    alt=\"Image hosted by Photobucket.com\">\r\n http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d133/Damidoux/Whatzeuf.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
    final sign looks like a D if rotated clockwise! Calligraphy on a computer is something
    strange because feelings are lost, but this first experience is pretty amusing.\r\n\r\n
    - then, a kind of logo work done in happy orange to go with the meaning:\r\n<img
    src=\"http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d133/Damidoux/Whatzeuf2.jpg\" alt=\"Image
    hosted by Photobucket.com\">\r\nhttp://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d133/Damidoux/Whatzeuf2.jpg\r\n\r\nPlease
    tell me which you like the most (my favourite tend to be number 3)\r\n\r\nHope
    you'll enjoy & even if my culture in modern typography is poor, I truly appreciate
    letterworks.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading."

    couldn\u2019t find one, though this may be due to an error in my search rather
    than the document\u2019s absence - and I don\u2019t Sohbet know whether it\u2019s
    a massive etiquette breach to even ask this, but:\r\n\r\nI really like one of
    your wtf ligatures. Please may I start to use muhabbet it, giving you appropriate
    credit?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nChris\r\n(having checked to see whether it\u2019s
    possible to e-mail you this rather than posting it to the board)\r\n\r\n"
