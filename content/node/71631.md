body: I am trying to see if there is a free or commercially available font either
  exact or close to the one used in the attached image of the Karmann Ghia decklid
  script.  I understand that the "karmann" is VW's variant of Futura.  The "ghia"
  is a little harder to match.  I have searched online through literally thousands
  of samples.  Any help would be appreciated.
