    have to add that these faces are by Neville Brody who invented this style."

  body: "This face looks very image club to me. But I could not find it. Looks like
    its based on very narrow and tall Radiant.\r\n\r\nI know I've seen this before
    though...\r\n\r\nI love Detroit & Chicago & and any east coast beat with that
    sweet soulful house sound. If you every come to LA we have Deep which Marcus Wyatt
    runs, Balance at the King King which spins really good stuff... but it is a cally
    sound though... like naked music and om... very clean... but sometimes I just
    want to hear a gritty black vocalist tearin' it up.\r\n\r\nSo I go deephousepage.com
    and get a lot of good stuff there.\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: I can speak to the fact that it is definitely not an Image Club face. However,
    I agree that it seems familiar. Probably because of all those hand-drawn and computer-enabled
    geometric faces that Neville Brody pinched out in the late 80s and early 90s.
    A very similar aesthetic.
