body: "I'm designing a logo for a local resturant for class (the One Caroline St.
  Bistro). The place is somewhat swanky, its old-style hip, like 1920's blues hip
  with a very formal quality. I thought for the logo I could design a typeface based
  off of european posters and magazine hand-lettered type from the 1920s/30s. People
  like Toulouse Lautrec and others. So I settled on takeing a lot of reference from
  the first cover to Simplicissimus (which is in the attached image). My typeface
  keeps coming out very childlike however, and I'm not sure if I should be trying
  to make it more formal or if the attempt at giving it straight lines is whats ruining
  its charecter. I've only really done one other typeface so I'm still very new at
  this, any ideas would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nalso, I didn't know where to put this
  because technically it's only a typeface I'm asking about, but It's really for a
  logo... I settled on here because I think after I get this sorted out I'll post
  the rest of it (the full logo) to be critiqued here.\r\n\r\n"

    Bad vector doesn't equal bad hand-lettering. If you want that that vernacular
    feel, try designing in the medium of the original.\r\n\r\n* If \"bad\" is what
    you're going for that's not a bad thing. =)"

    (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3822825115/103-9609069-8070254?v=glance&n=283155)\r\nand
    find better looking typestyles. I have seen better deco handlettered logos. That

    some of that roughness. If you like the proportions of the letters you can use
    that as a template.

  body: Zach, I'll just add my voice to the others. Your concept has a strong base,
    but the spirit of the lettering is lost by using the boundaries set by a vector
    drawing program. You might (or might not) find inspiration in seeing how others
    have translated the spirit of that time into letters <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=toulouse">here</a>.

    you need while keeping it as a vector; it'll then allow you to trace a hand-drawn
    version. \r\n\r\nIt's a fine line between cool and naff - it needs imperfection
    to give it character. Also, duplicate characters (the N, E and O) should have
    differing glyphs second time around.\r\n\r\nAs for the wider picture, it might
    be nice to keep everything else formal except your logotype; it would allow you
    to get away with such a quirky logo, if it's kept in check by using relatively
    formal bounds (i.e. flat colour, conservative/minimal typography and so on).\r\n\r\nIt
    takes some bottle to do something so different, nice one!"

    to balance the extended 'i' dot. Before you go crazy making these imperfectly
    perfect, make sure you have the composition nailed down."

  body: There's something off about your mix of sharp corners and rounded corners.
    Definitely don't repeat characters precisely for the logo itself -- hand-trace
    the repeated characters twice. And when you hand-trace, compromise a bit on the
    corners in both directions to soften that contrast.

  body: "Oh wow so many responses haha. \r\nmiss tiffany: that helped a lot, I've
    been looking for fontfaces inspired by lautrec and couldn't find any. Tablets
    and hand tracing are actually an interesting idea. I'd thought of a tablet but
    hadn't gotten around to trying it, tracing by hand might work even better.\r\n\r\nas
    for brushes, haha if im worse with something beyond a marker it's certainly a
    brush. I should try it though. Perhaps this weekend now that I actually have time.\r\n\r\nAs
    I was running out of time before the initial critique some classmates suggested
    I attempt to modify an existing font to get the feel I wanted so I changed Antique
    Olive - Black and ended up with this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stfj.net/misc/oneCarolineD1.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
    letters seemed to be working a bit better, but it still feels too childlike as
    a whole for me. I'd like to make it more bluesish. People in class suggested I
    make the pianno more organic in a lautrec style to try and contrast it with the
    letters and make it more formal that way. So recently ive been trying to come
    up with a way to display the piano in the right organic way, which i haven't found
    yet."

  body: "Wow, I find the third attempet a great improvement. The piano has found its
    position in a subtle but clear way, I like that a lot. And the bistro feeling
    is there, definetly.\r\n\r\nHowever I think you could work more on the lettering.
    On the whole it stills differ a little from the feel of the piano keys - the stroke
    in the drawing seems more natural, maybe because the \"imperfections\" are smaller
    and more numerous. You could try to give some of that feeling to the letters.\r\n\r\nThe
    straight vertical lines on the counters of the o in \"one\" and \"caroline\" are
    distracting, I think. They don't fit. In fact, I think you should try to avoid
    long vertical or horizontal lines. Break them up in small parts, or make them
    subtly into curves and diagonals.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you want to go for the \"hands
    on\" approach, you could try buying some heavy paper and cutting out the letters
    with scissors and/or an X-acto knife. And before doing, be sure to jump into  some
    ice-cold water for that extra-shaky effect ;)"
