  in one of my designs a few years ago. I really liked it and I would love to use
  it again, but I somehow misplaced my project and now it is driving me crazy. If
  you do have the name of this font, it would save me many hours of headaches.\r\n\r\nThank
  you fellow font lovers,\r\n\r\nManjii"

  body: "The font [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0235|Hannah]] by
    YouWorkForThem seems to have a very wide hand-drawn font in the family that is
    very close, I think, to your sample. Still I suspect your font may have been an
    amateur design.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
