  manuscripts that have been influenced to ungainly effect by the specter of MS Word's
  preset. \r\n\r\nI remember reading in Bringhurst that the 66 character line is the
  ideal length for continuous reading, but does this even apply to poetry? Have there
  been studies that backup this notion? I feel that I can't really make suggestions
  unless there is some research to back this up. \r\n\r\nIs it presumptuous of the
  designer to suggest a slightly modified textblock that might improve the overall
  readability of the work? Doesn't it seem wrong that a word processor should be the
  palette for a book that is a work of art?\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I'm a poet who wasn't
  aware of things like this before I became a designer so I understand why it isn't
  necessarily intuitive to be thinking of the dimensions of the book when composing.

  body: I mean I'm sure Word can be blamed for lots of things (gas prices, street
    gangs, Avian Flu) but can it really be blamed for long line lengths being the
    standard? Seems as if the answer would be multicolumn as the default, and that
    seems to be the opposite of what you want - clean text uninfluenced by the authoring
    tool? Beyond that why not provide a template to the authors? Push good practice
    upstream.

  body: "The ~66 character line recommendation is for continuous reading at average
    text sizes (10-12 points) with reasonable leading. It\u2019s related to saccades,
    the tiny eye movements across the line as one reads. Too many saccades on a single
    line causes discomfort and head turning, which distracts the reader, too few and
    the reader gets annoyed at dropping to the next line so quickly. IIRC Unger covers
    this in <em> While You Are Reading</em> which has a monster bibliography.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I would hope that good poets wouldn\u2019t be composing in a word processor to
    begin with. If Neal Stephenson can write with a Mont Blanc than poets can. "

  body: "I heard Bill Hill of Microsoft at last year's TypeCon say that the reason
    the 66 character limit works is that beyond that you have to turn your head, not
    just your eyes. And that slows you down--or maybe because it more likely you will
    have to look twice for the next line, but I don't remember exactly.\r\n\r\n>can
    it really be blamed for long line lengths being the standard? \r\n\r\nWell somewhat.
    Microsoft chose a condensed face--Times New Roman--as its default, knowing most
    people are going to be printing on letter sized paper or A4. With typewriters,
    Courier was designed so it would give the 66 character length on letter sized
    paper; Times New Roman at 12 point is way more. Given that these paper sizes are
    standard, I'm not sure that there is a general best solution, but the choice of
    Times New Roman--a great typeface in other settings--exacerbated the problem. "

  body: "Two potential issues with continuous text reading are what I call \"track-back\"
    and \"drift\". \r\n\r\nTrack-back refers to the activity of moving from the end
    of one line to the beginning of the next line. Ideally this happens smoothly,
    effortlessly, accurately, without distraction, without losing your place, without
    needing to look back up to recall the end of the previous line, etc. \r\n\r\nLong
    line lengths can undermine track-back  -- all the eye-turning/head-turning sorts
    of things mentioned. \r\n\r\nDrift refers to the phenomenon of accidentally slipping
    from one line to the next, mid-line. One of the most common culprits in drift
    is excessive word-spacing. When the word space approaches the distance between
    lines, then drift becomes more likely. Short line lengths (justified) generally
    lead to greater extremes of word spacing and can become susceptible to drift.\r\n\r\nAll
    of this is in the context of continuous text reading -- where the text/content
    generally has narrative linearity, momentum, forward motion.\r\n\r\nPoetry happens
    in a different mental time/space. It is a different typographic animal.\r\n\r\n<cite>

  body: "To continue with the Lorca observation, it seems to me that poets (not just
    of the concrete variety) have long been aware of the effect of layout on printed
    verse, and follow the general maxim that the longer a poem, the longer the line
    lengths, and the more the look of prose. It's a question of pleasant proportion
    in the document, as much as any purely literary concern.\r\n\r\nBlake's <em>Songs</em>
    and his <em>Prophecies</em> are an extreme example. But even Eliot follows the
    principle: <em>The Hollow Men</em>, for instance, has shorter line lengths than
    <em>The Waste Land.</em>\r\n\r\nAnother factor may be whether the verse is meant
    for silent visual reading, or to be listened to, the difference being that within
    the three-second span of conscious apprehension, many more words can be held by
    eye than ear. The relationship between temporal duration and speech/verse is discussed
    by Ernst P\xF6ppel (originator of the 3-second theory) in <em>Mindworks.</em>\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"Poets determine line length, not typographers.\"\r\n\r\nI agree with this
    in principle but when I see most formal variation dominated by the same Word preset
    it makes my head hurt. I've done an MFA in poetry and worked for literary magazines
    and it was often very apparent when the poem was composed for an 8.5 x 11 page
    without any preexisting aesthetic consideration (just one of wanting to use the
    \"whole\" page). I've talked with poets about this and many say they just open
    Word and go. \r\n\r\nI know it sounds silly to ask for science to speak to poetry,
    but its just as bad to ask a word processor to do the same."

  body: "I love Whitman's long lines btw.\r\n\r\nThis is more pointed to poets who
    employ dramatic use of white space and want to preserve each page as is from .doc
    to print. In the setting of a literary magazine, where page dimensions are fixed,
    this is often unrealistic, no? Not many can afford to produce <a href=\"http://www.voltpoetry.com/html/about.html\">Volt</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    encourage poets to make aesthetic use of white space but not from the standpoint
    of the arbitrary hegemonic preset!\r\n\r\nI can see how this can come off as whiny
    but I think its in the interest of producing better work for all involved."
