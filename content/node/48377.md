  foil-stamped piece, showing the actual foil you plan to use (or a close facsimile),
  prior to the printing? Are there service bureaus that can do this, (preferably in
  the U.S.)?\r\n\r\nthanks for any ideas...."

    laser toner.\r\n\r\nYou'd print out your piece, then 'iron' the foil on with a
    head pen and then peel it off.\r\n\r\nBut that was over a decade ago and have
    since long forgotten the name of it or if it even exists anymore..."

    it'd be a scrapbooking store. Maybe check there.

  body: "I recall these sheets too. One brand was called \"Copy FX\". There were these
    sheets of film you could attach to a laser print or photocopy, run them through
    the printer's fuser a second time (by making a blank print) and the foil would
    adhere to the toner. \r\n\r\nI worked for a while in a shop that had a semi-automated
    system that did this with the film on rolls, but it was a terrible mess, constantly
    jamming.\r\n\r\nLetraset had a hand operated system for a time with a similar
    material and a special hand iron.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think there might be places that can do a comp for you but it may end up
    being to expensive. If its to show a client, you could simply do a color comp
    and show samples of the process. If you have a printer in mind, ask them for samples
    from extra runs or misprints. They would likely have a book available with samples
    of foil to choose from.\r\n\r\nSometimes foil-stamping , sometimes referred to
    as Hot Stamping, is combined with embossing or even litho. One important thing
    to be mindful of is line weight and counters in type. Very thin hairlines in type
    are apt to drop out leaving the undercoating showing. The counters in the loops
    of e's and such can plug with foil if they are very small in size. These effects
    vary some from one printer to the next so seeing printed samples of your printers
    work is a good idea.\r\n\r\nStephen"

    at least you\u2019re in New York\u2014if you\u2019re going to find it anywhere,
    that\u2019s the place!"

    foil]] stuff. It looks interesting, but I wonder what a finished product would
    look like...

  body: "Very difficult to comp foil-stamping yourself. \r\n\r\nAs for service bureaus,
    Allan Wahler's company, A2A Graphics, does exactly this sort of thing. I know
    them for comping trade fiction covers -- lots of stamping and embossing, etc.,
    . . . you know the style. They also mock up credit cards and such, comping holograms,
    etc.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.a2a.com/home.html\r\n\r\n(Looks like they've just moved
    out of NYC.)\r\n\r\nP.S. Allan Wahler is husband to Carol Wahler, long-time director
    of the Type Directors Club. Many typophiles may have met him at various conferences
    without realizing what he does.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

  body: "A friend of mine used the laser foil back during my undergrad days. The end
    result looked great, provided you got it to work correctly. More often than not,
    it would jam or create a sticky mess inside the printer.\r\n\r\nCould you use
    a metallic marker to simulate the foil effect?"

  body: "The foil/toner laminator we used to use at my old studio to comp stamping
    was called an Omnicrom machine. Googling \"omnicrom foil\" doesn't turn up much,
    though. Looks like [[http://www.hotfoiluk.com/othermachinery.html|this place in
    the UK]] might have them.\r\n\r\nAlso, I haven't done it for awhile, but there
    are plenty of service bureaus that do rubdown transfers and they can usually do
    them in most PMS colors (including metallics)."

  body: "I've used laser foil tons of times.  It works great.\r\n\r\n1. Print out
    your art using a laser printer\r\n2. Cut out a piece of laser foil slightly larger
    than the area you want foiled\r\n3. Tape it over the graphic using the provided
    tape.\r\n4. Load the paper back into the laser printer.\r\n5. Print a blank page\r\n6.
    Remove excess foil from page.\r\n\r\nThe toner and the foil will fuse together
    leaving a foil graphic.  Pretty cool stuff.  I did about 150 certificates using
    this method.  Worked great.  \r\n\r\nI've used the stuff from paper direct.  But
    I've only used gold.\r\nhttp://www.paperdirect.com/Using+Laser+Foil/id=52/shop.axd/Content"
