body: "<img src=\"http://ninastoessinger.com/posted/selavy-sample.png\" />\r\n\r\nThis
  is a quick project, a little display font I\u2019m making for a project of my friend
  <a href=\"http://soulellis.com/\">Paul Soulellis</a>. \r\nHe was looking for a typeface
  reminiscent of the dotted one in <a href=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8g18iTqQm1rru3rpo1_500.jpg\">this
  1934 artwork by Marcel Duchamp</a>.\r\n\r\nAfter a quick back-and-forth on Twitter
  (which revealed there was apparently nothing reasonably close available in digital)
  I spontaneously started sketching a font inspired by those letters. (I only looked
  at the 13 letters in the French version of the project \u2013 there is also an English
  one that has more letters, which however differ from mine.)\r\n\r\nI like the quirkiness
  of the original caps, including that cropped \u201CS\u201D and the half-circular
  \u201CC\u201D (which led me to make the \u201CO\u201D quite round). In the lowercase
  and other glyphs I tried to strike a balance between simplicity / geometric clarity
  (well, can\u2019t have too much detail with these dots) and (potentially historic-feeling)
  quirkiness. Hence the straight \u201Cy\u201D descender, the funky \u201Cg\u201D,
  etc. In some glyphs (for instance, \u201Ca\u201D and \u201Ce\u201D) it has been
  rather hard to find a solution that would work for all of (1) glyph proportions
  and implied stroke construction, (2) dot density, and (3) desired character/design.\r\n\r\nThe
  design is now roughly complete, with some of the glyphs still needing some tweaking
  and a couple of minor glyphs still missing. Spacing still has some kinks, kerning
  is in its first iteration and shouldn\u2019t yet be looked at too closely, and some
  of the diacritics need readjusting; so it\u2019s very much in progress. \r\n\r\nAnyway
  I\u2019d love some more eyeballs on this though and would appreciate any and all
  feedback! Like I said, it\u2019s a bit of a quickie \u2013 Paul needs the font in
  a week or so, and we\u2019re planning to make it available as a free download then,
  too, just the one style. "

    There are no actual ligatures in the sample above (or the font), and none are
    needed I think. Part of the fun in working this out has been observing how patterns
    and apparent \u201Cligatures\u201D form by themselves with judicious placement
    of dots, also by way of spacing/kerning.\r\n\u2013 For future reference, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/soulellis/status/321609365553569792\">here</a>

    on each side? Perhaps you don't want such \"normal\" proportions...\r\n\r\nThe
    /C/ looks meager and could use two more dots (reverse the /D/ and drop the five
    dots in the middle of the stem. Here again maybe I'm \"normalizing\" more than
    you want, but I think an issue with this is that the uppercase and lowercase are
    feeling different in character. It's like the caps are quirky in both structure
    (many) and proportion (most), and the lowercase quirky in only structure (some).
    I might suggest the charming naivete of what you started with got lost in the
    sophisticated letters you added. Duchampian caps, Kochian lowercase?\r\n\r\nI
    think a one-story /g/ with a descender that comes halfway around (cf /j/) might
    fit better with the other letters."

    caps, Kochian lowercase?\u201D</cite>\r\nWell put, and a valid point. If you knew
    how long I had a Koch \u201Cg\u201D in there, too...\r\n\r\nI think I did it semi-consciously,
    making the lowercase more texty than the caps, although I may have taken it too
    far. What struck me when testing is that, Display or not, if you make it very
    large (or view it from close up) the letters invariably disintegrate into a pattern
    of dots \u2013 especially since the \u201Cresolution\u201D, if you will, is pretty
    coarse. When set smaller, however, it becomes quite legible. Hence I figured it
    might be a cool idea to have a lowercase that breathes a related spirit to the
    caps but can work for a sentence or even a short paragraph here or there \u2013
    which needs it to be less DIY-coarse, and more texty. But, yeah, I guess, I will
    have another look at simplifying / de-textifying some of the lc a bit, along with
    what you suggested about the caps (especially maybe the \u201CC\u201D)."

  body: "S\xE9lavy. Funny.  :-)\r\n\r\nThis sort of thing seems easy at first, but
    it's actually quite hard! I think you've done a great job, but there are some
    places I'd say you're being too ambitious/optimistic; especially in the lc where
    the dots are pretty far apart I think you need some different compromises.\r\n\r\nSome
    specifics:\r\n- Could you make the top of the \"a\" denser?\r\n- I didn't like
    the tilt in the \"e\" crossbar at first, but I think it's firm enough to work.\r\n-
    I love the \"g\"... on its own. But it just seems out of character here. I'm surprised
    the Koch \"g\" didn't work - it seems like a natural here. But a mono \"g\" seems
    like it would be a lost opportunity.\r\n- I would dump the \"i\"/\"j\" tittles!
    A gap of one dot seems insufficient to support them.\r\n- Unlike in the \"e\"
    I think the curl in the \"el\" is a mistake.\r\n- The \"S\"/\"s\": it's tempting
    to like them, but they still look like a dot went missing, like it's a mistake.
    I don't know if there's a way to make the top flatter.\r\n- Can you make the tilde
    less disjointed? One day you might need a double-acute, and then what?!  :-)\r\n-
    The ring diacritic isn't working. Why not just one dot? Or is that its own accent...\r\n-
    I'd make the cedilla longer. It <em>is</em> a French design!  :-)\r\n- I think
    the zero is a bit much.\r\n- Love the asterisk! (Is it one? :-)\r\n- The pilcrow
    is very pretty, but it needs more weight to work; try doubling the stem on the
    inside of the bowl. But maybe I'm thinking too texty.\r\n- I think the BP is too
    narrow.\r\n- Lower the bar of the Yen?\r\n\r\nYour \"dot-wise\" ligation is brilliant!
    I wonder if there might be a way to take that idea further/deeper...\r\n\r\nAnd
    a semi-crazy idea: if you built all the glyphs as composites, you could change
    the \"foundational dot\" into something else (like a diamond, a star, or even
    a letter :-) and the whole font would change!\r\n\r\nBTW, I don't know if looking
    at this might help in some way, but:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/88148\r\n\r\nGood
    luck with your deadline!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to work very well with these dots. I concluded that this was a display face and

    I\u2019m still a bit unhappy with the \u201Cs\u201D\_but not entirely sure yet

    of the changes you've made are good (like the longer /L/, the newer /bdpq/ and
    the straight /l/). \r\n\r\nI'd agree with Jasper about the /e/, I think the slope
    is almost gentle enough to look horizontal, and then because it's not, it catches
    the eye a bit. I'd make it more definitely sloped.\r\n\r\nOriginal /hmn/, I think
    are better. The /m/ especially I think is too wide in the newer version.\r\n\r\nI
    prefer the original /a/ where the bowl comes in at the bottom. I know that's not
    consistent with the new /bdpq/, but it's a different bowl anyway, and it's probably
    a good idea to distinguish them more in a font like this where things can easily
    get confused. In the newer version, the flatness of the bowl is making the whole
    shape look a little stretched horizontally/flat/wide. Maybe just the bottom could
    be flat? Or Craig's Telefon suggestion might be worth a try.\r\n\r\nDid you try
    a round /y/? (I mean like the /u/ but with a curved tail.) Or a goblet shaped
    /y/ like a /u/ with a centred straight descender ?\r\n\r\nThat /g/ is hard. I
    think the way you're treating the ear at the moment is somehow anachronistic.
    This seems to want to be essentially a geometric typeface and having the bowl
    so asymmetrical gives a very different feeling. I didn't find the original ear
    busy. And although I don't think a Koch /g/ should become your signature glyph,
    I think a) that it might actually fit very well here and b) you don't have too
    many options with only two or three discrete layers/levels of dots for the descenders.
    \r\n\r\nThe cap /S/ is bugging me. I think it's the way the dots aren't quite
    aligned horizontally. Geometrically, it's constructed of two circles, and your
    circles have dots at predictable places. I'd try aligning like this (sorry, I
    can't explain without actually drawing it). I think the second works better. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/S_4026.png]"

    There\u2019s a new \u201Cy\u201D which I rather like, it\u2019s maybe also better
    friends with the \u201Cj\u201D and \u201Cg\u201D now\r\n\u2013 n/m/h are almost
    like the original ones again (same proportions) but with a slightly improved join
    and top \u201Ccurve\u201D\r\n\u2013 b/d/p/q are like the original version, hopefully
    with ok joins\r\n\u2013 \u201Ce\u201D has a stronger/straighter crossbar now,
    very diagonal\r\n\u2013 Lots of little fixes (cap accents; tweaked S/s; wider
    pound sterling; fixed v-position on dashes and math stuff)\r\n\u2013 I\u2019ve
    also added some new glyphs (some accented characters, \xA9/\xAE/\u2122, daggers,
    some more math stuff, arrows, and a lozenge! \u2013 need to stop\u2026)\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    going to fix the kerning now, if anyone has any other feedback on this (mostly
    re. glyph design) I\u2019m all ears :-). Thanks again!"

    for the arm and 4 for the leg for /k/ (4 and 5 for /K/)?\r\nIn /b/d/p/q/, lowering
    that last dot before the join near the top of the bowl make the bowl look pointy
    on top. Bottoms of the bowls look less troublesome to my eye, but at the top I
    think that in the compromise between bowl circularity and smooth juncture, you
    may want to adjust placement of that dot to favor the former a bit more.\r\nI
    still think /a/ looks too wide.\r\nLove the asterisk!\r\nI bet you see dots everywhere
    you look now!"

    with Craig, the bowl of the /a/ could be a notch narrower.\r\n\r\n/S/ is looking
    great. I guess it wasn't possible to do the same alignments with /s/. But it's
    not too noticeable (I'm only aware of it because I'm looking hard.)\r\n\r\nI wonder
    if a geometric design should have a /y/ made of two straight lines.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're trying Craig's suggestion about the /Kk/ having more dots, you might pull
    the knee right into the stem so they share a dot.\r\n\r\nI might pull the diagonal
    of /2/ up slightly, top counter is slightly big.\r\n\r\nIt looks surprisingly
    good in text. Can't wait to see it in use. And definitely do an outline version.
    Clever to use components, that way you can easily generate new versions with different
    thickness outlines. Love it."

    might require the bottom to change as well. Love the z. Overall, I\u2019d love
    to see more quircks like z/s/x. 2 appears to be leaning right, but this quirck
    is a different kind than the previously mentioned. Watch the shapes of 6/9 (or
    maybe just watch the spacing of them?). Is the bowl of Thorn too small?"
