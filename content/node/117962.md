    Try also having a look to these 2 Sci-fi/tech sections at DaFont, [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Techno
    > Sci-fi]] and [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304|Techno > Various]] ([[http://www.dafont.com/boom-box.font|Boom
    Box]]...).\r\nTo get a ready-to-use /N (diagonal meeting right-hand vertical above
    foot), I'd probably start with either [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-qtype|QType
    FF]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/virusfonts/bourgeois|Bourgeois VF]]. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/4thfebruary/bladi-one-4f|Bladi
    One 4F]] would work pretty fine as well."
