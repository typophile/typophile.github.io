  resemblance to Stone Sans or Lucida Sans. And then there was another group, this
  time with heavy serifs, that also seemed to have a lot in common, but I couldn't
  pin them down to a source.\r\n\r\nWell, I think that I've run across the inspiration
  for this larger group of typefaces, whether from Mexico or Armenia or Russia...
