<p><img src="/images/old-images/numbers1_6672.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I need your help in identifying each of these numbers. They are all architectural numbers and inscriptions found in Melbourne, Australia and are the source for my Honours project.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no expert in this, but I&rsquo;m guessing that they&rsquo;re all custom? (The &lsquo;83&rsquo; looks like an elongated, condensed Bodoni, though). I need to know if any of these has been revived or if there&rsquo;s any similar font out there.</p>
<p>Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.</p>
<p>cheers
Christa</p>

<p>Your thesis project sounds like a good challenge and I hope it bears tasty fruit.</p>
<p>Typophiles&mdash;I don&rsquo;t have time to pick fonts with numbers that more or less match the styles in Christa&rsquo;s photos. It would be nice if you guys could help her out with such. You&rsquo;rethe individual face experts, not I. Thanks!</p>

thanks for your reply. Yeah I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;re custom, will go to the City Council tomorrow and see if I can find any information on the buildings.</p>

thanks for taking the time to reply, nice to find a fellow Melburnian here. I, too, wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed them if I hadn&rsquo;t been running away from work and trying to clear my head by walking around the city.</p>

<p>Sorry for the late reply, uni has kept me really busy.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that the 1904 has such striking resemblance with Gill Sans, given that Gill Sans was designed in 1927 and released in 1928. I thought it could be Johnston, but I checked around and found out that Johnston was designed in 1913. Even more intriguing since I found the numbers on a Federation Warehouse style building, with no significant history known about it.</p>
<p>I concur, 83 is pretty much Bodoni Antiqua Compress Demi Bold.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to reply!</p>
<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been flipping through Art Nouveau and display type specimens, there are some similar ones to the 1904 on the bottom right corner (found that one on Royal Arcade, btw). I think the rest is all custom.</p>
<p>Thanks again. I&rsquo;ll send you an email soon.</p>
<p>Christa</p>

<p>Are you assuming that the numbers come from the year they say? I would bet just about anything that that 1904 plaque was not made in 1904.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Craig,</p>
<p>Indeed, I was. Thank you for pointing that out. 
I have also found out for the 1849 numbers — I&rsquo;m still figuring out the correct architectural term for this kind of numbers, if there&rsquo;s any — it was not the year in which the building was completed, but the year the Pharmacy company (that first owned it) was founded.</p>
<p><cite>I would bet just about anything that that 1904 plaque was not made in 1904.</cite>
This might be a silly question, but would you care to elaborate why you think so? Again, I am no expert, and my research on this particular plaque hasn&rsquo;t been exactly fruitful.</p>
<p>Also, this might be of interest to some of you —
according to the records at Melbourne City Council, the 1932 was apparently Eric Gill&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>cheers
Christa</p>

<p>On stylistic grounds. Monoline sans serif types did exist at the turn of the century (though I do think this was based on the later Gill Sans as Tiffany said), but my understanding is that they were mostly used as a &ldquo;jobbing&rdquo; typefaces (for ads and other ephemera). So far as I know, they would not have been used to make something as permanent and serious as a building plaque. The uneven baseline seems stylistically out of character for premodernist design, too.</p>
<p><em> the 1932 was apparently Eric Gill’s</em></p>
<p>Interesting. That pentagonal 1 seems like a Gillish quirk.</p>
