I still think the spacing is really awkward. The inspiration by vintage lettering can account for the poor letter shapes.</div>

It might be safe to guess that the 'rv' combination was not used in the cigar brand name. It's also possible that some of these letters are inventions to make up for gaps in the original lettering sample(s). Even with those excuses, I would say that the kerning of LHF fonts is not always what they seem to spend their time on. Maybe with display fonts it's assumed the graphic artist using them will 'tweak' the tracking as needed.

Furthermore, if there is a font that you purchased from us and you unhappy with it, we will fix it to your satisfaction. Customer service is also a big priority with us.

The only way I can see that you could come to the conclusion you have is if you are using a program that doesn't display the kerning correctly, such as Word or Photoshop CS. That would explain your misunderstanding.

		<div class="commentbody">I am glad you like most of our fonts. But I really don't care if someone doesn't like a font. Please reread my response more carefully and you will see that I was referring to Mike Yenga's assertion:

<strong>"...that the kerning of LHF fonts is not always what they seem to spend their time on."</strong>

That is a different matter all together. I don't know how Mike knows what we spend our time on. But when I personally hand kern every single character with every other character, so that every single possible combination in the font has been covered -- that takes at least an entire day, in some cases even two. Furthermore, if Mike found a problem with the kerning of a font he purchased, I wish he would have given us a chance to make it right.

That said, it is true that some fonts simply don't work. And I would agree that Labelle is one of those that has bothered me for some time now. The characters don't seem to work well together. But this has nothing to do with the kerning.

The quality Letterhead Fonts offers is <strong>very</strong> important to me. I am removing Labelle from the site now (as I often do with fonts I feel aren't up to par). I will be happy to give any one who purchased LHF Labelle credit towards another font.

On a general and somewhat related note – not to diminish the quality of Letterhead Fonts, because certain types of faces and especially scripts <em>do</em> require lots of kerning because of their very nature – the amount of kerning pairs is not automatically a reference for the quality of a typeface. One could argue that a font with an impressive amount of kerning pairs is a font that was poorly spaced to begin with. :^)

This statement <em>isn't by any means related to Letterhead Fonts in particular,</em> just a general remark for educational purposes aimed at our new users.</div>
