  body: "I did not know minion was designed to be myriad's pair. Makes sense though.
    The subject matter is information for brochures of various topics (things like
    'quit smoking', 'pre-natal care', 'payment arrangements' etc.)for a hospital.
    The problem is that the hospital does not have an in-house design dept. so everything
    is outsourced. The result is that all the brochures look like they come from different
    entities and not from the hospital itself. I've been exploring ways of unifying
    the design and, for starters, want to standardize the typography. I was thinking
    about something sturdy, timeless and friendly. Myriad came to mind but was wondering
    about a companion text.\r\n\r\nIM "

  body: "Ok, so a general purpose serif that fits well with Myriad will do. I think
    Baskerville is a little antiquated and maybe too formal for your purposes. Other

  body: "Wow I also thought freight text (which I will be purchasing soon for myself)
    but It requires careful consideration when used. It would be a bit too much for
    those who are not familiar with type setting in general . Fresco and Charter are
    both excellent choices and I'm sure it would be much easier to use for the non-typographer.
    MVB Verdigirs is a beauty but a little \"too sharp\" for me. I think I'll go with
    Charter. Thanks soo much Mr. Coles\r\n\r\nIM"

  body: 'Correction: Minion was designed in 1989, Myriad in 1991. Minion was designed
    for book work. Myriad was essentially designed to showcase Multiple master technology.
    Myriad wasn''t intended specifically to match with Minion. However, both have
    been bundled with Adobe apps for a long time, and almost everyone has a version
    of both. '

  body: "I'm currently pairing Chapparal with Myriad on a brochure. Working out well.
    In general, I find that an unmodulated sans like Myriad is comfortable dancing
    with more spartan serifs (unbracketed for example - whitman, chapparal, scala
    etc). The nice part about chapparal are the weights and typographic goodies.\r\n\r\nR"

    better looking, especially the Italics. Ok, i must say i never liked Chaparral
    that much, hehe.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think Chapparal is nice as well. Caecilia and Chaparral are similar but
    not much. Caecilia is much more buttoned up and serious. Chapparal has a more
    casual and friendly tone.

    Caecilia because most of the brochures will deal with things of serious consideration.\r\n\r\nThank
