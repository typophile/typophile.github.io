body: "Dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m asking myself which substitution is the best
  to obtain the \u2116 symbol. I\u2019d use a stylistic set for it.\r\nI was thinking
  about these ways :\r\n\r\n1. sub N o space by numero;  < o sign\r\n\r\n2. sub N
  \xB0 by numero;  < degree sign\r\n\r\n3. sub N \xBA by numero;  < ordmasculine sign\r\n\r\n4.
  sub N \xB0 space by numero;  < degree sign\r\n\r\n5. sub N \xBA space by numero;
  < ordmasculine sign\r\n\r\nI\u2019m more oriented to 2 and/or 3, and you?\r\nThanks,\r\nJan"

  body: If it's a stylistic set, I'd go for option one. Most people have a hard enough
    time figuring out stylistic sets as it is. The easier you make it, the more likely
    people will use it.

    and useful scenario would be \"Ndegreesign\". But then you should hope no one
    will use your font for setting mathematical problems ;-)\r\nSubstituting \"No\"
    or \"No.\" with \u2116 would be very likely be unwanted. And anyone able and willing
    to insert a ordmasculine sign would also be able to use a numero sign."

  body: "Jan,\r\n\r\nI had the same question some time ago regarding the development
    of my own font. A small research did show the problem needs different solution
    according to the language/keyboard in use.\r\n\r\nN+\xB0 makes sense where keyboards
    offer an easy access to degree sign, but does not help if the keyboard does not
    brings this key. The same about N+\xBA as ordmasculine is not present in many
    keyboard layouts. And N+o+[ ] cannot be used in any language where the word \"no\"
    is present.\r\n\r\nThe solution I built was a stylistic set with Numero substitutions
    based on the language in use.\r\n\r\n<strong>1</strong> Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan,
    Galego: N+\xBA as ordmasculine is available on these keyboards.\r\n\r\n<strong>2</strong>
    Latin American Spanish, French, Canadian French, Italian, German, Dutch, Polish,
    Romanian: N+\xB0 as the degree sign is the one available.\r\n\r\nAs an universal
    shortcut, I also added the substitution \\+N+o = Numero, but I'm unsure if this
    is the best option. And I still need to verify the keyboard used for Proven\xE7al
    (Occitan), which I supposed is the default French."

  body: I wrote the code above by memory as I do not have FLS available right now.
    But IIRC you firstly insert a generic sub command to be applied to all languages
    of the default script (of course, if this is desired) and then add the language-specific
    substitutions. I believe you can find sample codes in most recent "pro" fonts.

    applied.\r\n\r\nFor languages belonging to the latin script which have not been
