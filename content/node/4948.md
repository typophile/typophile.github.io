body: Is there a typeface &#40;Unicode, of course&#41; that allows insertion of both
  `normal&#39; characters, such as those in ASCII and Latin-1, as well as Tengwar?
  I intend to learn the language &#40;Sindarin or Quenya, I have not yet determined&#41;
  and have no pen with a nib &#40;or whatever it is called, sadly my generation knows
  little of these things&#41;, and it would just be easier to do this on the computer
  anyway, so I was hoping to find a typeface that is attractive, serifed, and hopefully
  free. Any ideas?
