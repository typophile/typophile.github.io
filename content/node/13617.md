  Fuller Benton (November 30, 1872 \u2013 June 30, 1948) was born into the type business.
  His father, [[Linn Boyd Benton]], was a type-founder and the inventor of the matrix-cutting
  machine, which revolutionised printing. The son graduated as a mechanical engineer
  from [[Cornell]] and went to work with his father in the newly established type
  design department of the [[American Type Founders]] Company. He went on to become
  the most prolific designer in America, producing more than 180 types of great diversity.
  Despite all this, he is less well known today than his contemporary [[Frederic W.
  Goudy]]. However, his types have been much digitized and revived, especially by
  [[Font Bureau]].  \r\n\r\nMorris was the chief type designer of the ATF from 1900
  to 1937, and designed a great many typefaces, ranging from revivals of historical
  originals, such as [[Garamond]] and [[Bodoni]], to new faces of existing fonts such
  as [[Goudy]] and [[Cheltenham]], to strikingly bold and original designs such as
  [[Hobo]], [[Stymie]], and [[Broadway]]. In addition, his \"gothics\" such as [[Franklin
  Gothic]] and [[Alternate Gothic]] are much more similar to modern sans-serif fonts
  such as [[Helvetica]] than the crude, [[grotesque]] versions of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nMorris
  has been credited with 221 type designs including: Adscript, Alternate Gothic, Announcement,
  American Backslant, Benton, Bold Antique, Broadway, Canterbury, [[Century]] Old
  Style, [[Century]] Expanded, [[Century]] Schoolbook, Chic, Clearface Gothic, [[Cloister
  Oldstyle]], Commercial Script, Dynamic, Empire, Engravers, Engravers Text, [[Franklin
  Gothic]], Freehand, Gravure, Greeting Monotone, Headline Gothic,Invitation, Light
  OldStyle, Miehle Gothic, Modernique, Norwood Roman, Novel Gothic, Parisian, Raleigh
  Gothic Condensed, Roycroft, Shadow, Rugged Roman, [[Sterling]], [[Souvenir]], Thermotype,
  Typo Script, Typo Roman, Venetian, Wedding Text.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
