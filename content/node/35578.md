  a 'hacking at', I need some foreign feedback other than that of my peers around
  me. Haha, so if any poke or pulls, anything is encouraged.\r\n\r\nJust a bit of
  background on the concept story. A metropolitan inner city of Chinese orientation
  (Singapore-English/Chinese speaking), a modern restaurant where business men/women
  come for morning/afternoon meetings, and Dim sum is served. Semi traditional that
  also incorporates a newer modern twist.\r\n\r\nThanks yea\r\n\r\nTom"

  body: "Vertical versions:\r\nThey definitelly need more space around \"letters\".
    I don't know chineese but if the writting is in columns instead of rows, I'd keep
    a vertical version of the logo and put DIMSUM out of the rounded corners rectangle.
    And use the serif chineese fase instead of sans serif one.\r\n\r\nHorizontal versions:\r\nThey
    have some more breathing room for chineese letter although not enough. Most of
    that space is created by putting all type inside of the box. Don't push type into
    the borders.\r\n\r\nThere's also a problem with your chineese type. Different
    style for the \"flower-like-thing\" and letters and weight with others... I'm
    talking about serif style here."

  body: Thankyou litera for the critique, I hadn't picked up on the lotus line weights
    in relation with the character stroke widths before. Ill have some more developments
    up soon, reworking the DIMSUM typeface and also that breathing room.

  body: "Hi Mot,\r\n\r\nAs a Chinese speaker I like the vertical concept a LOT more,
    but why only the words \"Dimsum\" in English?  The English name would appear to
    be \"White Lotus\" - why not use it?    \r\n\r\nAs for the Chinese fonts, the
    brush fonts on the first three examples are a little standard and old fashioned,
    I would opt for a true brushstroke scan which would be far more elegant and less
    boxy.  As the to the font furthest to the right, this is very much overused in
    the last couple of years in Hong Kong and Shanghai, and ONLY fits with a very
    fashionable, more modern interior restaurant concept.  Overall I would say you
    need to start with true calligraphy to really capture an Asian essence.  Having
    the \"BAI\" (white) character in white really detracts from the purity as well.\r\n\r\nWhy
    not ask the owner if he still remembers how to wield a brush?  Most Singaporean
    kids learned at school, and he may just be very, very good, or at least have his
    own style that can be a strong base.\r\n\r\nIf you need help from a Chinese designer,
    get in touch!  I know plenty who do superb work (andrew AT tonerider.com)\r\n\r\nAlso
    on the horizontal fonts, one your \"LIAN\" characters is missing half the \"CAOZITOU\"
    - grass radical on the top!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
