  body: "The reason you can't find the font is because Nike creates it's own proprietary
    fonts. Originally they created Victory by Plazm Fonts here in Portland which no
    longer is running. \r\n\r\nNike continues to develop it's own proprietary fonts
    for brand differentiation. They now have a collection of typefaces, you can't
    buy them. \r\n\r\nWieden + Kennedy is here in Portland as well, they are Nike's
    ad agency of record. "
