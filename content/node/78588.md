  body: The wikipedia article on Optima says it's used "on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
    and was used by the 2008 John McCain presidential campaign.[2] Optima is also
    used as the official branding typeface at the University of New South Wales[3]
    and by Aston Martin. Optima is used iconically for Traveller, and Diaspora used
    it to pay homage to Traveller.[4]"
