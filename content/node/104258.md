    Unicode codepoint, and should be encoded as that, not as **. The two-character
    string ** does not mean the same thing as \u2605. This is why we have a character/glyph
    distinction, so that semantics can be encoded at the plain text level and not
    left to the vicissitudes of glyph processing."

  body: "<blockquote>Assuming you've <strong>named</strong> BLACK SUN as uni2605</blockquote>\r\nWhen
    I look at the names FontForge is expecting for U+2605, I see blackstar, a35, DD130,
    StarDingbat1, uni2605 or u2605; there is no black SUN around*. And the Fontlab
    file standard.nam (mine from some demo is dated 2009) contains\r\n<PRE>\r\n0x002A
    asterisk\r\n[...]\r\n0x2605 !a35\r\n0x2605 !blackstar\r\n</PRE>\r\nwhich, I guess,
    means Fontlab expects you to use <code>asterisk</code> for U+002A and does not
    like <code>a35</code> nor <code>blackstar</code> for U+2605 so that I would guess\r\n<PRE>\r\nsub
    asterisk asterisk by uni2605;\r\n</PRE>\r\nto  be the most likely working substitution.
    \r\n\r\nI see that U+2605 is in very few fonts. I see it in the DejaVuSans fonts
    (named uni2605) but it is in none of the  DejaVuSerif fonts.\r\n\r\n* [Added]
    Well, there is\r\n<pre>\r\n2600\tBLACK SUN WITH RAYS\r\n</pre>\r\nin the unicode
    file <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NamesList.txt\"><code>NamesList.txt</code></a>,
    i.e. at U+2600,  \u2600."

  body: "<em>enabling users to shortcut to the black star</em>\r\n\r\nBut they're
    not really shortcutting to the black star, if what they want in their text string
    is the black star character, not just the black star glyph in their display with
    this one particular font. With your method, what they get in the text string is
    **, and that's what they'll get if they copy and paste the text, change the font,
    etc.. I dislike this sort of thing because your resulting display is misleading:
    the user thinks there is a black star in the text, but in fact there isn't. Also,
    what if someone chooses your font to display some text in which there is a double-asterisk
    sequence, e.g. as part of a footnote system? It will display incorrectly as a
    black star.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, don't try to solve character input issues
    at the glyph processing level."

  body: It being a purely symbol dingbat font designed for a certain use, one symbol
    is never used next to each other and so it will be no problem at all. I do get
    your point however, any other time I would back straight away from doing anything
    like that.

  body: "Micheal, for years we set type using TeX running in a DOS box. This is pre-Unicode,
    but I built what we called super fonts that are similar to today's OpenType --
    small caps, proportional & tabular figures, lining & oldstyle, etc, etc., all
    in one font. Since we were running TeX in DOS, we'd just change whatever characters
    we wanted to include by writing an encoding vector, leaving the first 127 (named)
    characters as they are in ASCII. Everything remained properly named\r\n\r\nSo,
    much of my experience was with author -- or publisher -- supplied files where
    a character could be font dependent -- e.g., where someone in the world that relied
    on hard-wired Mac or Windows encodings had gone in & made an 0macron, but put
    it in the odieresis slot. What a mess. Even more fun with Greek and all the different
    encodings used...\r\n\r\nNor is it always clear today just which file someone
    will go back to. We have jobs from when we typeset using TeX -- always ASCII files,
    of course -- and were making PDFs for the printer to use. Now, when the publisher
    wants to resurrect the text,  press #1 will want to use the ASCII files, but press
    #2 will want to use the pdfs. And this with our stuff, where character names were
    in fact correct. Imagine the situation where a Mac/Windows encoding (I think what
    you're calling WYSIWYG) was used.\r\n\r\nEven today, with Unicode, I refuse to
    give the  double-f ligatures a Unicode codepoint. Yes, we may get a \"missing
    character\" with old or supplied files, but now is as good a time as any to fix
    that. Legacy characters should be banished while there is still someone around
    conversant with how we got that way. To introduce new errors should be a crime/misdemeanor.
    \r\n\r\nEDIT\r\n\r\nI agree that using the pdf format for archiving typeset material
    is *probably* the smartest thing to do. Treat it as standing type. We can go back
    to books set using TeX with PostScript fonts where the printer file was pfd, then
    make what are essentially patch corrections using InDesign with OpenType, and
    \"paste\" them into that pdf file. If you don't do this, the only other sane way
    would be to reset the whole job. Again, if you don't, the 3rd revised edition
    somewhere down the road could become really problematic. As I said, just treat
    the pdf as standing type -- but not every publisher sees things this way, and
    of course, as the customer..."

    not have installed, I think he will see  squares (undefined characters) for the
    missing font; it is then clear there is a problem, and it is probably clear what
    measure to take. In non professional applications, a fallback font is used instead;
    the same holds for Powerpoint. I have seen nice Powerpoint presentations that

    is expected to do, I just don't know.\r\n\r\nI am now on another machine and I
    did a fast check, putting this time the ligature in liga to get right away the
    blackstar when typing ** without having to find what to do to activate dlig; I
    used the font in XeLaTeX (from the 2012 distribution) and InDesign CS3 and then
    opened the pdf with FontForge\r\n\r\nI see that the name given by InDesign to
    the ligature in the pdf is asterisk_asterisk (even if the ligature in the font
    is <code>sub asterisk asterisk  by uni2605;</code>).\r\nThe name given  to the
    same ligature, same font, in the pdf generated by XeLaTeX is uni2605\r\n\r\nThat
    implies that if I copy-paste what displays like the black star in the pdf generated
    by InDesign, I get this: **;  if I copy-paste the same looking thing appearing
    in the pdf generated by XeLaTeX, I get this: \u2605. Of course, the search will
    behave accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhen I have the time, I'll check with MacTeX 2013 because
    the pdf generated by XeLaTeX or luaLaTeX in MacTeX 2012  does  not allow searches
    on  stylistic variants. The pdf that is generated is just wrong.\r\n\r\nPS. The
