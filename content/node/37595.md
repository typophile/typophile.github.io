  body: I can't find an exact match but Malaise Tall and Solstice are close and if
    you go to identifont.com and "fonts by similarity" and type in one of those you
    will get more fonts in that vein.

    what I thought, but it\u2019s not one of her fonts.\r\nShe does (did?) a lot of
    custom lettering, though."

  body: I heard it was good too. I almost went this year, but the getting there was
    too daunting. Plus I think my camping days are behind me.

    Hari</a>.\r\n\r\nFor the record -- when I say \"makes me think\" this means the
    general feel is similar but it's <em>definitely not</em> a match (I've often been
    misunderstood in the past). :^P"

    rent a car. The dust is awful and can take you years to get out of your car....
    and normally, because it is so fine, you just can't and ruin your car."

    Man. You'll get a kick out of it - first it will have to go into a page layout.
    When it's ready I'll email you.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile - they do call the inner circle
    \"la playa\" - which does mean beach - yes, lots of beach and no water...."
