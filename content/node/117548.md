body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a student project for an optically responsive
  typeface design to be used in Adobe Indesign CS6. A little over-ambitious for my
  first ever type design project admittedly but I have made good progress up until
  this point. I now, however, have hit a complete dead end and desperately need some
  advice from typographic aficionados.\r\n\r\nSo far from research I understand that;\r\nOpenType
  does support a 'size' tag but that this tag is not relevant to any desktop publishing
  software.\r\nAdobe InDesign features a 'Automatically Use Correct Optical Size'
  preference, left over from the advent of Adobe MM typefaces, that never really took
  off as a format. But, however, will still work.\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind I have
  produced two compatible master fonts along an optical axis and exported them from
  Fontographer as a PST1 MM format file. From this master file I am able to produce
  the intermediate interpolations. The issue that I am now having is that I am unsure
  what file format/naming conventions I am required to use in order that InDesign
  automatically use the correct design for each optical size. I've gone back and forth
  on this for weeks and really should move on to other work but I'm a bit stubborn
  when it comes to this kind of thing! All the documentation that I am able to find
  doesn't make it clear enough for me what I need to do now and not owning any MM
  files myself I am unsure of what state they exist in\u2026\r\n\r\nAre all of the
  interpolations stored within the MM as a single file or is it simply name tags that
  unite the family in desktop publishing software. If anybody has an old Adobe MM
  file that they wouldn't mind sending to me to scrutinise that would be amazing!\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\nMatt"

    Jenson MM font file is named AJenMM and contains 6 masters. If you haven't already
    read it, the document at this link may provide the information you seek, particularly
    pages 19-20 concerning the Optical Axis Map.\r\nhttps://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/5091.Design_MM_Fonts.pdf\r\n\r\nAlso
    be sure and read the section on instance naming limitations although it may not

  body: "@George\r\n\r\nThat definitely gives me a better idea of the direction to
    head in though also confuses things somewhat. So now I need to know using what
    software I am able to create the correct MM file including interpolations? It
    seems to me that Fontographer only allows me to create a file with the initial
    masters at each opposite end of my optical axis. I've actually read that document
    a couple of times but can't find the information that I require. \r\n\r\nLong
    shot but is there any chance that you would be willing to share the AJenMM file?
    Purely for academic purposes, I think I need to have a closer look at a working
    model. If so would you mind emailing to wasteofpaper@hotmail.co.uk ?\r\n\r\nThanks
    in advance!"

    dependent upon point size, from the loaded masters. You don't need to furnish
    any instances, just the Postscript MM file with the masters.\r\n\r\nJust a FYI:
    it is considered bad form to ask for commercial fonts here and if I am not mistaken,
    prohibited."

    an MM optical size axis, and it should work. <em>Unless</em>, of course, the InDesign
    team has at some point removed that functionality. This may have happened at some
    point\u2014I am sorry I do not remember specifically, but it would not surprise
    me if it did. Adobe officially ended support for multiple master fonts quite a
    few years ago, back when I was on the type team."

    is surely there needs to be some kind of supporting file alongside the MM format
    to express to InDesign at which points on the optical axis an interpolation is
    necessary, otherwise how does the publishing software know the create an instance
    at *example 72pt for the top end of the axis. Is this what an .AMFM file does?\r\n\r\n@Thomas
    It definitely still works in CS6 and I believe CC too! https://www.flickr.com/photos/nicksherman/9081693584/in/photostream\r\n\r\n@George
    My sincere apologies, I'm nearing my wits end with this project and for academic
    purposes it would make my life a lot easier if I were able to study a commercial
    MM file. Your point is completely understood however.\r\n\r\nI currently have
    a 33kb Postscript Type 1 outline font file, set up as a MM with an optical axis
    but InDesign is recognising it in the 'fonts' folder. Something isn't right and
    I cannot work it out?!"

    a responsive typeface that adjusts its design at varying optical sizes! Not bad
    for my first ever type design and a student project. It seems that Fontographer
    just wasn't giving me the control that I needed over variables to make this idea
    a reality. Once I started working on the design in FontLab it all fell into place
    relatively quickly. The Multiple Master options are a lot more detailed and customisable
    in this case.\r\n\r\nJust want to thank both of you guys so much for posting and

    a bit in the manual, yes. But it seems you are good now. Yay!\r\n\r\nFontographer
    also has MM support, but I haven't generated an MM from that app in about 17 years,
    so my memory is a bit fuzzy.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, generating either a Mac
    or Windows (whichever platform you're on) Type 1 MM font from FontLab Studio should
    do everything you need, as long as InDesign still supports it.\r\n\r\nYou are
    lucky on that score. Because there is no real UI for it to speak of, the InDesign
    team hasn't felt any strong reason to pull the support (unlike the MM slider in
    Illustrator, which is long gone)."

  body: "@hrant\r\nAs far as I'm aware it may only be supported by Adobe Indesign
    (though notably it seems to be supported in almost all versions including the
    latest, CS6 and CC) as far as other desktop publishers go I don't know. Though
    I'm certain it obviously won't work in word processing. For my means I only really
    needed it to work in InDesign :)\r\n\r\n@Thomas\r\nI found documentation on the
    FontLab manual to be immensely helpful. Fontographer on the other hand surprisingly
    not so much and quite misleading. I suppose being the platform for 'intermediate
    and beginner' type designers Fontographer just didn't provide the options that
    I needed to take this project forward. There seemed to be very little integrated
    control over the MM axis and the files MM PST1 file I exported from Fontographer
    wouldn't open in any other type applications (in addition to not being recognised
    by InDesign).\r\n\r\nAs you have already stated, however, the Type1 MM files from
    FontLab were perfect, though I did have to use TransType to convert them to a
    Mac friendly version as my model of FontLab doesn't seem to export Macintosh Multiple
    Masters! I've tested already and the optical axis is working perfectly in InDesign.\r\n\r\nIt's
    fortunate that the InDesign feature remains though kind of feels as though the
    technology is regressing in a way. It would be great to see more UI and support
    for Multiple Masters to allow for much more sophisticated typesetting (particularly
    for optical sizing) though having said that I can also see the downsides of such
    options being automated or presented to a less learned audience.\r\n\r\nEither
    way I've done what I set out to do and learnt a shit load in the process!"
