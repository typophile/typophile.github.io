body: My first guess was Myriad, but the "G" looks different. Or Frutiger? Any Ideas?

  body: yes, it looks really close to Frutiger but the lowercase "t" has a different
    ascender.

  body: Humanist 777 matches well. Except for the clipped G.

  body: 'Humanist 777 looks pretty close as well. But same as Frutiger: not the same
    ascender at the lowercase "t". Tricky...'

  body: "I think this is pretty obvious: someone modified Frutiger, maybe just for
    this logo, maybe to sell it as a \u2018custom typeface\u2019. A few terminals
    were straightened (\u2018t\u2019), others were cut off perpendicularly to the
    stroke direction (that is what might resemble Myriad), and the \u2018G\u2019 bar
    was shortened. But it definitely started out as Frutiger. By the way, Humanist
    777 is just Bitstream\u2019s name for Frutiger."
