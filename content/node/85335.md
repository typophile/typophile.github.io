body: "Tightly kerning a modified Swift small caps for a heading and ran into a problematic
  space between the \"R\" and \"A\" perhaps caused by the combo of a conservative
  shoulder and long leg of the \"R\". I've actually extended the shoulder a bit and
  taken some of the lean out of the \"A\" to try to tighten this up.\r\n\r\nWas curious
  what you typographic experts recommend in terms of kerning for this pair.\r\n\r\nFrom
  top to bottom:\r\n\r\n1. Spaced so bottom of characters are spaced consistently\r\n2.
  Joined legs to create a bowl\r\n3. Shared serif...air between letters looks good
  but creates tension at the join\r\n4. Clip left serif of \"A\"...\"R\" serif takes
  precedence and reads well, but too close for comfort\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YNGVG.png\"

  helps...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8QWhj.png\" />\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: 'Whatever you do, it should relate to the other spacing, such as between the
    OB and BR. Kerning is never just between two letters, unless it''s a two letter
    word. The concept is to get the whole thing even. So I would say open up the other
    spacing... '

    of other characters although I prefer #2 on it's own, so may open up spacing of
    the other letters to allow for it.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    caps need often need some extra tracking."
