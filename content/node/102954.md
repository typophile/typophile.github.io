  body: The word talent suggests an expressible skill that is most often presumed
    to be inherent in the person and contrasted with the kind of skill that is developed
    with hard work and experience. It follows that if you remove the means of expression,
    an inherent skill remains in the individual, just as it does if that individual
    chooses not to express the talent. This is what makes it possible to say that
    someone is wasting his talent.

    the piano, remove Van Gogh from the paint, and what have you got? Lots of other
    perfectly competent people who composed music and painted pictures, but whose

  body: Inateness is usually presumed in talent, a kind of built-in advantage or proficiency
    that makes it relatively easy for someone to excel at a certain skill. However,
    in use we are frequently judging talent on the basis of output, rather than input,
    and don't always know how much effort has gone into developing a skill.

  body: In the case of Mozart, I'd agree that innate talent was probably a huge factor,
    maybe the biggest factor, but he also had a father who was a musician and composer
    who started teaching him at an very young age. When you look at most folks who
    had a famous talent you'll find years of study and hard work.

  body: "Talent is not the innateness of a skill, but the innate ease of learning
    such a skill. As such, it is still dependent on the time spent training that skill
    (i.e. effort), which is again dependent on the personal emotional value (i.e.
    motivation). However, talking about a built-in skill is pointless.\r\n\r\nTalent
    is of course as well a relative term. It only means something when contextualized
    within a certain social environment and within a certain time lapse. The top athletes
    of the 1896 olympic games may have seemed plainly untalented put next to today's
    top athletes. From this point of view, \"Am I talented?\" is less a question about
    yourself than a question about which people you consider talented.\r\n\r\nBut
    it's a good question, Neil.* What would have been of Van Gogh if you'd only given
    him a piece of chalk? Does the tool makes the artist?\r\n\r\n(As type designers,
    it's essential to keep asking ourselves whether the tools we use are nourishing
    our ability of expression or not. B\xE9zier curves are the most numerically stable
    representation of an outline, but they are surely difficult to handle (pardon
    the pun), as smoothness depends on the position of two Bezi\xE9r handles. On the
    other hand one has the constraint of in-extrema point-placing. Therefore, at least
    to me, it makes an enormous difference to draw sketches by hand before working
    with Bezi\xE9r curves, one reason for this being that with a pencil I'm able to
    <em>sculpt</em> the glyphs into paper.)\r\n_______\r\n* A kind of question which
    is more easily answered with a beer in hand on a saturday afternoon."

    that a factor called 'grit', which is devoted persistence practicing the task,
    even the face of difficulty, is also necessary. That ability to focus and persist,
    which is fed by passion for the task and other factors is as important or more
    important to high achievement as raw talent. \r\n\r\nBut raw talent is important.
    One of the coaches at my high school used to say \"you can't win the Kentucky
    Derby with a mule.\" In the case of Mozart or Van Gogh, I think the 'instrument'
    misleading. Mozart would have been a great musician with a different set of musical
    instruments. And Van Gogh could have been great with water colors. What is pretty
    clear is that musical talent and artistic talent\u2014or talent in poetry or mathematics\u2014are
    rather specific endowments, which don't necessarily carry over to other aspects
    of life. I was reading recently that Van Gogh was, outside his huge artistic gift,
    a sadly inept and psychologically fragile individual, who was regularly taunted
    and bullied by cruel young men.\r\n\r\nThe real geniuses in my view always have
    both: a rare gift for what they do, and a huge passion and devotion of time to

    is not meaningless, and far from being subjective it is quantifiable in various
    ways, mostly involving the amount of time it takes for an individual to become
    proficient at a learned skill. So, for example, I have a friend who has a talent
    for language acquisition, by which I mean that he finds it easy to learn new languages

    may have had, was still preoccupied with making music. Despite his excesses, it
    was the center of his life. Van Gogh painted tirelessly for hours on end, insanity
    and poor vision not withstanding. They may have been talented. They may have been
    geniuses. But, it was still a boat load of work. People tend to see the talent

    wasn't wrong about his brilliance, but he was not only personally tortured, but
    also philosophically on a fundamentally wrong track, and tied himself in philosophical
    as well as personal knots. \r\n\r\nRussell after being deeply impressed with Wittgenstein,
    rejected his views and lost patience with him. In the infamous incident of the
    clash between my late teacher, Karl Popper, and Wittgenstein, Russell took Popper's
    side. (The book on this incident doesn't quite get right the argument at its core.)
    I have Popper's and Russell's bias on Wittgenstein, but a great number of people
    idolize both him and his philosophy. \r\n\r\nI think Nick Shinn is right that
    the picture of the tortured genius, which Van Gogh represents, and Wittgenstein
    fits, is unfortunately overemphasized. There are happy geniuses like Benjamin
    Franklin and Richard Feynman.  \r\n\r\n "
