  cover. \r\n\r\nI've been thinking of foil stamping on different materials to get
  an illusion/hidden effect.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations for a 'shy' font or any suggestion
  on printing techniques that would give an illusion/hidden effect?\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n:)"

    font (what ever you think that may be). It would suggest you have confidence,
    but you don't like to bring attention to yourself.\r\n"
