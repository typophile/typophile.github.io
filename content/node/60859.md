body: "\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI'm designing a book in which the chapter titles are presented
  in spreads. While some of the titles are fairly easy to lay out, some are a bit
  trickier - see attached. I need tips on how much allowance I should give the letters
  in the gutter, and if I should create separate text boxes for each page rather than
  one across the entire spread (if this lessens headaches with the printer down the
  road).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    if it is Smyth sewn, and minimal extra space if it is saddle stitched. (If it's
    a mechanical binding, like wire-o or spiral, I recommend you change the design
    so display lines don't straddle the gutter.)</li>\r\n<li>Don't split a letter
    across a spread. If possible, don't split a word across a spread. Using two separate
    text boxes will probably make this easier.</li>\r\n<li>Book binding is an industrial
    process, and facing pages can only be made to align within certain tolerances.
    As you move forward with this design, bear in mind that on some copies of the
    book, the baseline alignment on facing pages will be off by a couple of mm.</li>"

  body: "It is actually possible to bind sheets into books so that they open out completely
    flat--the device used is like two very narrow pages that are glued together with
    the insert in the middle, but only part way, at the edge. So the effect is a \"stalk\"
    or \"Y\" shape that flattens to a \"T\". \r\n\r\nNot really relevant here. Especially
    good for maps."

  body: "Another thought: Can you change the symmetrical arrangement? If you can make
    the layout asymmetrical, you can do something like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SPREAD_4852.JPG]\r\n<em>(I
    apologize if I've broken the words in awkward places, but I'm afraid I don't know
    Swedish.)</em>"

  body: "Thanks for the tips.\r\n\r\nI've budgeted for hardcover binding with the
    broker (still have to specify for double fan adhesive), but there may be room
    to revise. I like the Y/T binding that Nick mentioned, but wonder if it's pricey
    and lengthy to produce.\r\n\r\nAre there any examples out there of this type of
    spread design? Benetton's Colors magazine comes in mind, but I don't have copies
    in hand. Any tips?\r\n\r\nAlso, is it an absolute no-no to split a letter in the
    gutter even with text this big (the book is roughly A4 in size)? I'm hesitant
    to set each chapter title differently as it'll affect the overall book design.\r\n\r\nThanks
    in advance for your thoughts! :)"

  body: With sewn-section hardcover there would be no loss of paper in the gutter,
    so theoretically you could do what you propose. Registration of the folded and
    trimmed parts in the sections would remain a problem though. Ask the printer

    the photo budget, I'll move forward as is and speak with the broker in the meantime
    to see what adjustments are necessary."
