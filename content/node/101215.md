    a bowl is like keeping a human in a ziploc bag.\r\n\r\nWe actually kept a number
    of goldfish alive for 4-5 years (first in a backyard stream/bog system and then
    in an aquarium) but with all the elaborate equipment & materials and the constant
    monitoring I felt like a nurse at a retirement home.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    makers?! By the way:\r\n\r\nHave you not regarded him who argued with Abraham
    about his Lord, because God had given him kingdom? When Abraham said, My Lord
    is He who gives life and brings death, he replied, I [too] give life and bring
    death. Abraham said, Indeed God brings the sun from the east; now you bring it
    from the west. Thereat the faithless one was dumbfounded. And God does not guide
    the wrongdoing lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
