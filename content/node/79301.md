  Pangram]]\" blog is featuring a pangram about a different U.S. President every day
  of this month. Some of my favorites so far:\r\n<!--break-->\r\n* Roosevelt\u2019s
  major buzzword: \u201CSquare Deal.\u201D His maxim: \u201CSpeak softly and carry
  a big stick.\u201D\r\n\r\n* Informed that Prez Calvin expired, a big jokester queried
  \u201Chow can they tell?\u201D\r\n\r\n* Prez Hoover is acknowledged as a jerky executive,
  but his dam is quite fab.\r\n\r\n* On jaunty Franklin\u2019s watch, government\u2019s
  size expanded quite a bit.\r\n\r\n* Before quitting the prez job, Ike reviewed the
  military-industrial complex.\r\n\r\n* Defying the Soviets in a Berlin square, Prez
  JFK exclaimed he was a donut.\r\n\r\n* Prez Richard M. Nixon requests you avoid
  talking about JFK & Watergate."
