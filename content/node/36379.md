  body: "Tahoma is a bit more condensed.\r\nAnd the spacing is tighter (like in your
    sample).\r\nAnd then there are some details."

  body: Do either of you know the story behind Tahoma? Was is developed specifically
    for Microsoft, kind of like the Helvetica v. Arial?

  body: "This is what I found at myfonts:\r\n\r\n<em>Tahoma is one of Microsoft\u2019s
    new sans serif typeface families. It consists of two Windows TrueType fonts (regular
    and bold), and was created to address the challenges of on-screen display, particularly
    at small sizes in dialog boxes and menus.\r\n...\r\nThe Latin, Greek and Cyrillic
    characters were designed by world renowned type designer Matthew Carter, and hand-instructed
    by leading hinting expert, Tom Rickner. The Arabic, Hebrew and Thai characters
    were designed to complement Carter\u2019s initial designs. Tahoma sets new standards
    in system font design. It is ideal for use in User Interface Scenarios and other
    situations requiring the presentation of information on the screen.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe
    Verdana fonts were created specifically to address the challenges of on-screen
    display.\r\nDesigned by world renowned type designer Matthew Carter, and hand-hinted
    by leading hinting expert, Tom Rickner, these sans serif fonts are unique examples
    of type design for the computer screen.\r\nThe generous width and spacing of Verdana\u2019s
    characters is key to the legibility of these fonts on the screen. Despite the
    quality of the Verdana font family at small sizes it is at higher resolutions
    that the fonts are best appreciated.\r\nIn the words of Tom Rickner, \u2018My
    hope now is that these faces will be enjoyed beyond just the computer screen.
    Although the screen size bitmaps were the most crucial in the production of these
    fonts [their] uses should not be limited to on screen typography.\u2019</em>\r\n\r\nSo,
    both fonts were created by the same designers and both designs are owned by Microsoft
    (and both fonts ARE essentially the same)."
