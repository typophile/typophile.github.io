  have designed a number of glyphs in a single EPS file, I am wondering if there is
  a way of importing this file into FontLab and it recognising the individual glyphs.
  ScanFont use to do this, but it doesn't work on Mountain Lion :-( . Or is it only
  possible to import glyphs one by one. \r\n\r\nPart two \r\n\r\nOnce the EPS has
  been imported, is there a way in FontLab to shift the glyph position up or down
  en-masse (in the case of Superscript, Subscript, Denominators, Numerators etc)\r\n\r\nI
  appreciate anyone's feedback. Thank you."

    some arbitrary character slot, then move or copy them one-by-one to their proper
    positions. Same amount of work, but maybe easier switching among windows within
    one application.\r\n\r\nEither way, the position of each glyph will have to be
    adjusted, and I've found it works better to enlarge each eps glyph (or the whole
    page of them) BEFORE copying to FontLab.  Otherwise your carefully designed glyphs
    may get distorted by their nodes being forced into FontLab's integer-based grid
    system.\r\n\r\nIn FontLab, select the characters to be shifted, then Tools/Action/Contour/Shift.\r\n\r\n

    copying to FL\" what do you mean? Are you saying that FL reduces the size of my
    vector image? I have designed to suit 1000px tall (with baseline at 800 down for
    example see pic attached)\r\n\r\nPete\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Baselines_3736.png]"

  body: "Maybe I haven't learned to set FontLab's eps import settings properly, but
    if I have an eps image in illustrator (where point locations are mathematically
    analog), and that image appears, for example, as one fifth the size of illustrator's
    pseudo US Letter-size page, and I import it into FL, it will end up about 75 units
    high, with the control points all on grid intersections. This is a distortion
    of the original image; that distortion is magnified whenI resize the FL glyph
    by a factor of ten.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I expand the image in illustrator
    close to a full-size page before copying it to FL, it may not need resizing at
    all, and if it does, the mathematically introduced errors are much smaller.\r\n\r\nI
    am NOT a professional type designer; others here will probably point out some
    major error in my process!\r\n \r\n- Herb"

    you can do all kinds of things to many characters at once. However: many things
    that can be automated end up biting you later. Case in point: creating a superscript
    by simply reducing a glyph and moving it up results in a glyph that's too light.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi HHP,\r\n\r\nYes, I agree, reducing glyph size and moving it up would be
    too light. That's why I have been spending time playing in Illustrator making
    the glyphs. I have got a test copy that I wanted to try you see. Is there a better
    way to increase weight in FL. What I did in Illustrator was type font at 300pt,
    create outline, reduce to 65%, add 0.7mm offset path, remove original, add another
    0.5mm offset path and then reduce to the original height. It worked ok. but now
    I have 40 + glyphs. If there is a better way in FL I am very much up for hearing
    about that. I know that there is an expand path function but it seems to be a
    bit hit-and-miss to use. What would you suggest?"
