body: I search around for a thread about this already, but didn't really find anything
  that helped me out. I am in the process or creating a lot of reference materials
  for myself, (charts, tables, things with numbers, etc.) and need/want to purchase
  a new font to work with. Problem is that I can't find one that I am happy with which
  contains an extended character set including lining, tabluar, proportional figures,
  ligatures, accented characters, and all the other goodies. Someone must have a few
  good suggestions for me. Thanks.
