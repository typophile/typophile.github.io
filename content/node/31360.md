body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been tasked with creating an identity for an online marketing
  company called Further. The client wants a logo which achieves impact, but also
  has an elegance to it. Ideally also, it will allude to idea of \"taking a client's
  business further online\". \r\n\r\nI'm stumped. Sketch after sketch is yielding
  little more than frustration. So any thoughts on potentially suitable typefaces,
  or visual ideas would be very welcome!\r\n\r\nYours hopefully,\r\n\r\nZ"

    out. Sure there is a bloody obvious solution which is staring me in the face.
    \r\n\r\nAnyway, for my sins, these are the least poor ideas... \"friendly\" modified
    type, \"pixel\" type forming device, and capped up type to see how it works. Please
    don't comment on execution as clearly there is a lot of work to do...\r\n\r\nI'm
    not going to be earning my crust with these efforts! Please stimulate some thoughts...\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nZ[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Further_ideas_5856.jpg]"

  body: "To me, the concept of \"further\" could be represented by extending part
    of a letter (try the stem of 'T' or the leg of the last 'R'). Other concepts could
    be right-pointing arrows or long horizontal lines.\r\n\r\nFranklin Gothic could
    work as a good starting point, but the top version looks too much like the Brother
    logo. Try setting it in lower case, or even unicase.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: How about extending the top of the "F" so it goes out over the rest of the
    word? You could also have it cross the top of the "h" in some interesting way.
    Would post an image but am about to drive home.

    isolation? I too like to develop ideas in collaboration, but with people who bring
    something more to the table than \"I don't have any ideas\".\r\nAll too often
    people come along saying \"I'm stumped, I have no ideas, what would you do\" (often
    not supported with any background information about the project or any resemblance
    or attempt of brainstorming.)\r\n\r\nMy suggestion to you is to get away from
    the computer for a bit, you won't get to \"work with like-minded people to stimulate
    ideas\" sitting alone at a computer - in fact 'like minded' and 'stimulate' don't
    often go together. ;)\r\n\r\nGo exploring, jump on a train, or bus, or bike and
    travel further than you have previously, take a sketch book and/or camera. Document
    your journey and progression, collect things along the path, see where it all
    leads you. Perhaps your adventure will be driven by \"further\" or perhaps you'll
    forget about it all together, either way it's good. Then once you return ... if
    you decide to, return to your gathered inspirations and relive them, this time
    in a different environment. There's even enough keywords in this paragraph to
    get you started.\r\n\r\nPost your sketches etc if you're keen.\r\n\r\nAll the
    best,\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul

    a moment, has arrested 'the flow' which has then been championed somehow - 'Further'
    is all about the power to overcome ...to go beyond.\r\n\r\nKinda like our lives,
    no? \r\n\r\nGraphically speaking, 'Further' could then be a linear element (or
    a rhythm thereof) which has suffered an intrusion - and then regains it's line
    with an asymmetrical balance.\r\n\r\n'Further' is a metaphor for Democracy herself...\r\n\r\n________\r\nHiro\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
