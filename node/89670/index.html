<p>Some of you will love this font and some of you will hate it.</p>
<p>The Man Greater Than Money Font blatantly ignores traditional notions of typography to achieve harmonious word shapes without awkward negative spaces or strokes. The letters are not really letters but instead highly legible geometric forms so that these shapes can function as visual elements within the layout.</p>
<p>I commenced working on this font 17 years ago and created it to be used exclusively in secondary display settings; especially for magazine layouts because I do so many.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, the full “Man Greater Than Money” font can’t be shown.  The Man Greater Than Money Font contains: Basics, Alternates, Display figure (not shown to conserve space), Universal Accents, Tabular figures (not shown to conserve space), Diacritics, Flips, Cyrillics (not shown to conserve space), Diphthongs (not shown to conserve space) and  Akhand Ligatures (not shown to conserve space). Yes, that&rsquo;s tens of thousands of Alternate glyphs in a single font that does not even have any minuscules.</p>
<p>You can see the font here

<p>Please help me get the word out on this font.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Copy and pasted from the Kickstarter post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I provide two dollars when I can just wait and eventually I can get the Man Greater Than Money Font for free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First off, if you really cannot afford two dollars for a font, just send me an email and I will let you know when it is available to the public and were you can get it for free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, however, understand the point you are making: that despite what an incredible value the Man Greater Than Money Font is at a meager $2.00, by ultimately offering it free of any charge, I am creating a disincentive towards baking the project. For that reason I shale release the font in the fallowing manner: If the project raises $1 then all the Basics will be released with the font but only the basics. $6,000 and all the Alternates are also released. $12,000 and all the Display figures (not shown to conserve space) are also released. $24,000 and all the Universal Accents are also released. $40,000 and all the Tabular figures (not shown to conserve space) are also released. $75,000 and all the Diacritics are also released. $125,000 and all the Flips are also released. $175,000 and all the Cyrillics (not shown to conserve space) are also released. $225,000 and all the Diphthongs (not shown to conserve space) are also released. $250,000 and all the Akhand Ligatures (not shown to conserve space) are also released.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words the font will be released no matter what, how extensive the font will be right from the start is completely dependent on you. Any portion of the font that is not immediately released will be; just at a later time; perhaps by anther Kick Starter project but that is yet to be determined. I do not care to contemplate failure right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As of this writing the project has raised a whapping $28.00 and even if it does not raise a penny more I am still obligated to release for free at least the basics. Here is a secret I will most likely release more than the basics even if I do not raise any were near $6,000. The reason for this is that I did not create this project to raise money but as I stated at the very top of the Kickstarter post.</p>
<p>“The most important thing to know is that this project was created to build appreciation and a network of goodwill so when I announce my forth coming revolutionary project I can have an audience to communicated to directly. Because of my disabilities, I currently have no online network and yes, I fully recognize that a font is the type of idiosyncratic project that less than one percent of the population cares about. However, the next project will have incredible mass appeal, enact substantive societal good and may even profoundly impact an industry. Really, the next project will be Steve Jobs kind of big. So even if you don&rsquo;t care to donate a cent to this project please send me an email or better yet give me call so that when I announce the massive project I can inform you about it directly.”</p>
<p>Success will be based on the amount of people I reach not the money raised. I want to release the full font. It is already done but I need to provide an incentive for people to promote the project.</p>
<p>I am thinking that if 100 people contact me by Kickstarter, even if no one else contributes any money, I will add the Alternates to the release.</p>
<p>If 200 people contact me will also add the Display figure to the release.
If 300 people contact me will also add the Universal Accents to the release.
If 400 people contact me will also add the Tabular figures to the release.
If 500 people contact me will also add the Diacritics to the release.
If 600 people contact me will also add the Flips to the release.
If 700 people contact me will also add the Cyrillics to the release.
If 800 people contact me will also add the Diphthongs to the release.
If 900 people contact me will also add the Akhand Ligatures to the release.</p>
<p>Do you folks think this is a good promotion idea?</p>
<p>Please blog, e-mail, text or twitter about this project.</p>
<p>Thank you,
Alfonso
