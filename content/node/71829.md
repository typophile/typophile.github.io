  in this image: http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v250/81/58/703761159/n703761159_852889_3083.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  have tried using WhatTheFont.com without success as it identified each of the cut
  segments in the letter as separate characters. I have also tried Identifont.com
  and found some remotely similar fonts, but none that are exactly the same.\r\n\r\nAny
  help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I think it's simply [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/impact/|Impact]]
    and TODDFEST is the result of a little playing around in photoshop or illustrator
    or both.

  body: You could be right, actually. But I thought that since both instances of the
    letter D and letter T look the same that it could have been a font with that effect
    already built in. I'll see if I can replicate the effect in PhotoShop using Impact.
    Thanks for your response!
