  am looking for a nice old style font face that has a real small caps font and is
  also available somewhere with an app license for smartphones. The actual font I
  wanted to use was \"Minion Pro\", but Adobe doesn`t provide app licensing for their
  fonts yet : (\r\n\r\nAs an alternative I found \"Sabon\" via myfont.com, but still
  wanted to ask you guys what you have been using and how it worked out with the licensing
  for you.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance : )"

    I would be interested to hear what you think of the licensing scheme.
