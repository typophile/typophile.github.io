  body: I would look for some consistency in your letterforms. Are you hoping to create
    something with an unfinished look?

      Decided to try a hand written instead of computer generated letterform. This
      is for a class learning how to generate your own fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: I would pay particular attention to the angle of the letterforms' axes, the
    capital S, for example, really sticks out. The letterforms are based on calligraphy,
    so any intentional inconsistencies should take into account the method by which
    the letters would be created calligraphically.

  body: "I'd suggest that you either work on your calligraphy for a few weeks (at
    least), or try digitizing something other than your current calligraphy. At the
    moment you're struggling with the calligraphy and that is doubtless making the
    font-making part all that much harder. You don't want to try to learn both at
    the same time, believe me....\r\n\r\nOn the calligraphy side, you're doing an
    italic style that is normally done with a 30 degree pen angle, but you have a
    much steeper pen angle that's more like 60 or 70 degrees, which is not working
    very well for you.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
