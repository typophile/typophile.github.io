  the additional flourishes and ornaments attached to the letters and used as borders
  on the sign are hand-drawn or characters from some other font. Sorry the sample's
  so small and hard to see - it's the best I could find on the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002PYS7Y\">Arrested
  Development DVD</a>, and I can't find any better pictures online.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for taking a look at it!"

    same \"leaf\" copied four times and rotated to fit the different parts of the
    'F'.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: That's what I thought. I was just wondering if they were recognizable as being
    from some other font, or if it's too small to tell.
