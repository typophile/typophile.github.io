body: Hi All.  <BR>while reading &#34;Schriftkunst&#34; by Adolf Kapr I found an interesting
  piece of type, by an obviously czech designer called Stanislav Marso - the Marsuv
  Grotesk. I was searching through google but couldn&#39;t find anything further than
  his name for about three times nor could I find any digital piece of his work.  <BR>
  <BR>So you&#39;re my last chance. Has anyone round here Information about this guy
  and his typefaces - maybe I was just too stupid to find something that is too obvious
  &#40;Maybe the type is now common under another name or something&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  sure someone in here can help me. <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik <BR> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>In the meantime you could check issue #7 &#40;page 13&#41; of his wonderful
    TYPO magazine: it contains a short paragraph about Mar'

  body: Hrant is right. The only digital typeface from Stanislav Marso &#40;1910-1975&#41;
    is RePublic by Brousil. Marso was an employee of Grafotechna, Czech metal type
    foundry. There are even more typefaces created by him, but you can only find them
    in old Czech books on type and in some past issues of Typografia magazine. Typografia
    is a Czech magazine for printers and typographers since 1888; it is now published
    by son of Mr Marso.

  body: BTW, I have this massive, old-school specimen book done by Oldrich Hlavsa&#42;
    for ITC &#40;not mine - on loan from Gerald Lange&#41; - it&#39;s called &#34;Typographia
    2&#34;, put out in 1981, and the last 50 pages or so focus on Czech designs. And
    there are a couple of Mar

  body: I got &#34;mine&#34; from the UCLA library, but bookfinder.com is showing
    multiple copies, from $60 to $650. It also seems to be showing those magazines
    Filip mentioned, as well as that huge specimen book I mentioned. Just enter &#34;Hlavsa&#34;
    for author and browse. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Thanks Hrant and Filip. <BR>That was about what I imagined. I think I gonna
    try to make a revival of that beauty. I&#39;m not quite sure if it&#39;ll work,
    but trying can&#39;t be a mistake. I have some time off in August, so i&#39;ll
    start then.  <BR>I&#39;m sure there is someone with similar efforts anywhere,
    because this is not a specimen I found in the back of an old bookshop. I mean
    it was in a  pretty popular book.  <BR>There is definitely a lack of popularity
    for this face. Which, I think, It should definitely earn. <BR> <BR>Down there

  body: I think Dominik is the one you have in mind. &#40;Though I do agree with you
    -- it&#39;s a beauty.&#41; <BR> <BR>I just wanted to know what was the proper
    procedure if you wanted to make a revival of old hot metal fonts. <BR> <BR>Names,
    I assume, will still generally have copyright protection and so there must be
    legal hurdles there. <BR> <BR>But what about the design itself? <BR> <BR>Victor

  body: Thanks for the support guys and sorry for not tuning  in a while. <BR> <BR>I
    haven&#39;t spent a single thought on the legal issues yet.&#40;Thanks, Victor,
    for that hint, how naive can one be, doh!&#41; <BR>But that would be something
    I sould surely check before starting something like this. It was more of a heart
    to arm decision than thought about very well. &#40;I don&#39;t know if this was
    idiomatic but I hope the picture delivers&#41; <BR> <BR>For me the whole thing
    should be fun at first.I didn&#39;t have any commercial issues in background.
    To be able to sell something like that, I&#39;d surely  need to have the original
    metal. Since I&#39;m surely not able to pay for these, the aspect of making money
    with it is out of play. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t really know it from original source,
    but at least in the U.S. it seems to be only the name is under copyright protection.
    How else so many derivates for popoular fonts would have been developed. &#40;I
    don&#39;t tell no company names&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll check about the legal
    issues. But it would be a pity if this shouldn&#39;t work. <BR> <BR>Servus <BR>
