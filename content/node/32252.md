body: "Some time ago I developed a logo for a customer using Galahad. I am working
  on a project where I am being pressured to use Garamond Pro as the logo type and
  I think it looks awful... Due to the business of the customer having changed in
  recent times toward the elegant, I am looking for something with mild swashes, that
  isn't too far departed from Garamond in an attempt to save my project turning into
  a design nightmare...\r\n\r\nMaybe the most important question I am asking is -
  what arguments do you guys employ when you are trying to win over a marketing person
  from the dark side?\r\n\r\nThanks, and be gentle, it's my first post (having enjoyed
  reading the forums here for a few weeks)...\r\n\r\nSteve"

    purchased CS2 as it was a freebie, and I have been guilty of overlooking this
    typeface. The K swash is just right, as it's the first  character in the logotype.
    \r\n\r\nSo there's the easy bit... <sigh> now I have to win them over with some
    convincing designerbabble to avoid publishing something that will be spoiled by
    a bad typeface choice!\r\n\r\nI guess a designer's opinion doesn't count for much
    until he/she hits the big time... moan, gripe, winge...\r\n\r\n"
