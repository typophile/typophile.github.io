  however the \"R\" stroke has a gap in the original and the \"y\" and \"a\" seem
  to have a more squared finish.\r\n\r\nI've searched high and low, is there anyone
  that can help me out?\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/royals1_6152.jpg]"

    will  you find a script logotype that is made from a font, especially for such
    a high-profile identity.\r\n\r\nIf you want something similar, veer.com has a
    bazillion script fonts. You could also try house industries or letterheadfonts.com"
