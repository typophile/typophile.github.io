  body: "Hi Jordan\r\n\r\nHistory is great, but it's not as heavyweight as what you're
    showing here. This is based on an ultra-heavy Bodoni or Didot style. I would have
    said MT Engravers Bold, but the brackets are straight on that one. <em>(BTW, could
    you please stop double posting/repeating yourself... I find it very unsettling)</em>"
