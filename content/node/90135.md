    and there are some lingering bugs yet in 5.1, but as you're using it already you
    know what you're in for.

  body: "I've heard some rumblings about network issues on Lion from our IT folks.
    They have to deal because new Macs come with Lion, but they do not recommend anybody
    else in the company upgrade yet, unless they have to for some reason. I expect
    it is related to the problems with Active Directory integration of Lion machines,
    as described here (among many other places): http://4sysops.com/archives/troubleshooting-the-network-accounts-are-unavailable-error-in-mac-os-x-lion/\r\n\r\nOther
    than this, I don't know of any big problems with Lion. This is only big if you
    are trying to integrate Lion machines into an Active Directory based network.\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

    your file should be around <em>somewhere</em> on your disk, take a look at http://gothick.org.uk/2011/07/19/revealing-lions-hidden-library-folder/\r\n\r\nI'm
    used to browse around with the Terminal and it seems that's unaffected (pending

    how much overhead there actually is for each folder ..."

    the FL Beta forum instructions, then back to business.

    Lion is related to the iPad user conventions. The fundamental changes that Apple
    made by dropping the older Mac pre-intel code workarounds is now done.  Mountain
    will seemingly be just a way to make all the iToys speak the same dialect."

    it. I guess it's a decision if you want to make a big step and get a system with
    many new parts to work (FontLab 5.1 with Lion) or go one change (First FontLab
    5.1, new Mac OS later) at a time.\r\n\r\nI'm happy with the new, fast FontLab
    Studio on Snow Leopard, which uses the recent Python version 2.6, and I'm not
    sure if I'll ever update my Snow Leopard to Lion, because I know for sure that
    some of my other applications still need to run PowerPC code, the most important
    one being Creative Suite 3. I've read that I won't be able to print from it without
    PowerPC support, and I certainly won't pay 1500$ for an upgrade just to be able
    to continue printing.\r\n\r\n(The other stuff I'd hate to see fall behind would
    be my C64 emulator and DOOM Legacy ;)"

    OT support is a system-level thing. If that's so, it seems strange that OT support
