  body: ' I vote on #1. definately not number 3 - it dosen&#39;t look like that was
    your original purpose at all. <BR> <BR>the left rounded finishes vs. square finishes
    right is nice and would make some interesting white space in between characters.  <BR>
    <BR>both rounded sides dosen&#39;t look as distinguised. <BR> <BR>nice font. its
    got that meld of retro and future all in one. neat '
