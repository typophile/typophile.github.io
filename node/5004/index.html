		<div class="commentbody">Ted,  <BR> <BR>Not sure about where you or your customers are asking about. But in NYC there is a series of classes organized by the Type Directors Club, called the Masters Classes. Every 4th Thurs of the month, $25 for TDC members, $40 for non members. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.tdc.org/events/tdcmasterclass.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.tdc.org/events/tdcmasterclass.html">http://www.tdc.org/events/tdcmasterclass.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>Currently they are taught by Ilene Strivzer of The Type Studio. <BR> <BR>I have not taken the classes myself, as I understand they are more focused on the use of type than on the design of type. I am  a user of FontLab, teaching myself with the manual, and I also would be interested in a class that focused a bit on the philosophy of type design but more on the practical aspects of using yours and others software. <BR> <BR>Perhaps I could urge you to contact the TDC or other like organizations to perhaps sponsor classes or workshops, dealing with FL.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">James, <BR> <BR>Thats really exciting. Forgive me if TDC already serves this in some capacity. to be honest I have been a rather negligent TDC member for the last year or so. I was kicking myself for having missed your Opentype lecture. <BR> <BR>I would find great value in a small group/class that focused on the design of type, particulary the technical side, although having a group to critique a work in progress is always helpful as well. I actually had tried this a couple of times with a small group of fellow designers, but I think it would benefit from having a structure. <BR> <BR>Having developed a number of font families now, while I've simultaneously been  figuring out Fontographer and now FontLab, I'm looking for help before I continue to set my uninformed or bad work habits in stone.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Christian/James <BR> <BR>I'm in for a series on type design using Font Lab. Topics that would be of interest to me would include: <BR>1. Drawing in Fontlab for Illustrator Junkies <BR>2. Encoding/Unicode explained <BR>3. Using mulitple master in FontLab <BR>4. Tips &amp; tricks for spacing/kerning a font (general/class-based) <BR>5. Creating opentype features <BR>6. The font header (what do all these dialogue boxes mean!!!  <BR>How do they effect the way the font functions?? on macs, pcs?) <BR>7. Exporting tips/tricks <BR>8. Hinting done right <BR> <BR>What would be really cool is a several month series where the group starts in the design process, then moves into the technical side addressing the issues above. <BR> <BR>Probably ambitious maybe, but I don't know of a class in New York that addresses the technical side of things. Most are learn to draw and alphabet, not turn your alphabet into a font. Thanks for starting the dialogue. <BR> <BR>R</div>

Whilst MM ist a great idea, it is also a particular pain in the a*** to do. Trust me, I've been there. And once you've done the fonts, what apps actually still utilise MM. Adobe has dropped support for MM fonts some while ago. In fact a similar result can be achieved by extrapolating technology, as was used in Skia in the good old QuickDraw GX days.

But that never caught on did it? as it was supported by only one (minor) third party software maker and market sales of the fonts themselves was virtually non-existant. Adobe actually was working on releases for the GX format but they were never released. Guess I find the example/argument a bit odd when comparing it to MM and its demise (after a near decade run, whether or not it received the support that was hoped for). I still use MM. And from what I understand it is supported by the latest Mac OS system version. Extrapolation technology would be great, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where is it? <BR> <BR></div>
