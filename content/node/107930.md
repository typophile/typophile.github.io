  (I will try search first)\r\n\r\nI am not a graphics artist but I have an affection
  for fonts. I don't have a huge collection, not a hoarder, but I like good looking
  fonts. I use fonts in desktop publishing (mostly PDF creation)\r\n\r\nMy favorites
  are the Lucida Bright family except I prefer to use Lucida Mono instead of Lucida
  Typewriter. I'm also quite fond of the \"base35\" Postscript fonts and those are
  what I actually use most often when writing, Times particularly. And for script
  fonts, I really like one I found on myfonts.com awhile back called HandsomeClassic
  - it's my goto script font, especially when typesetting fiction and I want to indicate
  something the character is writing.\r\n\r\nMost of my personal use of fonts is in
  the context of LaTeX where I like to have the type 1 PFB versions of fonts, which
  are getting hard to find now, but converters usually work - but the font licensing
  can be hard to understand if it is allowed, I wish the legalize would be written
  with a common man interpretation attached. I prefer to buy Type 1 .pfb that specify
  embedding is OK because it often is hard to figure out what I can and can not do
  with converted fonts and LaTeX does not yet directly support .otf fonts without
  converting.\r\n\r\nAnyway, why I'm here, I needed to create 8 characters in SVG
  for a project I'm working on (personal project) and I am toying with the idea of
  actually going all the way and creating a proper font.\r\n\r\nI have no experience
  in creating fonts so I have a lot to read and learn before if I decide to go on,
  but even though I can see where I need to improve the glyphs I have created, they
  actually are turning out quite nicely.\r\n\r\nTo create them, right now I'm just
  using a text editor, a browser to render the SVG, and paper and pen for a lot of
  math. Linux is my chosen operating system, hopefully there is a usable program I
  can use to import the SVG paths and start seriously working on it. In the past when
  I tried to use FontForge to convert a TTF font to Type 1 for use in LaTeX it just
  did not produce usable results, so I had a friend do it on a Mac system, but hopefully
  FontForge has gotten better since then (at least a decade)\r\n\r\nWell, that's who
  I am, I'm here to read and hopefully avoid common mistakes, and maybe someday I'll
  finish it."

    far as licensing goes -- in general, if you stay with OpenSource fonts, you can
    pretty much do as you want. If you stay with Adobe Originals, you can also modify
    them for your own use, but cannot redistribute the resulting fonts for others
    to use. Embedding Adobe (originals) is OK, too. \r\n\r\nIn your position (desire
    to embed fonts in searchable documents) , I'd skip fonts from the Monotype conglomeration
    (Monotype, Linotype, Bitstream, etc. And note Monotype is buying up ever m0re
    font publishers and distribution channels all the  time). Also avoid fonts from
    Font Bureau and Hoefler & Frere-Jones. Again, unless you really want to research
    the subject, stick with OpenSource and Adobe Originals.\r\n\r\nAs far as making
    your own fonts -- See if you can get FontForge loaded & working on your machine.
    That's likely step one...\r\n\r\nhttp://fontforge.org/\r\n\r\nAfter step one,
    there is still a lifetime's work here... Good luck to you.\r\n\r\nBTW, I use to
    live near Montgomery Creek. Just take 299 out of Redding, about 2/3ds of the way
    to Burney. Pretty country."

  body: "Well, yes, I know about and use CTAN regularly, but there's a lot of really
    nice commercial fonts I would have purchased had they been available as Type 1
    .pfb and what's weird is a lot of them use to be but for some reason, that purchase
    option seems to no longer be made available with many fonts.\r\n\r\nI can use
    lcdf-typetools to convert most .otf fonts to type 1 .pfb and then make the metric
    files needed for use with pdflatex but that's where I'm often un-clear on if I
    legally can.\r\n\r\nA lot of people I know take the philosophy that you take liberties
    with fonts and stock images etc. until you are specifically told not to but I'm
    wired in a weird way where I can't do that without feeling guilty. Ah well.\r\n\r\nBut
    that's a different issue and not really why I'm here, I'm here to learn about
    the mechanics I need to know to make my font idea really work, things like how
    in many fonts the letter X has the top right part of the stem offset a little
    to give the illusion of being two stems crossed because if you really did two
    stems perfectly crossed the illusion is that one is offset.\r\n\r\nStuff like
    that has to be taken into consideration for me to make a font that works well.\r\n\r\nWith
    respect to fontforge, I have it up and running. I'm now playing with the best
    way to format my SVG files so that import of the path into fontforge will require
    the least post import adjustment.\r\n\r\nIf I do finish this font, I'll probably
    release it for free but if I do decide to sell it instead, I'll explicitly state
    that the user may modify and embed as they need to in order to accomplish the
    task for which they are using the font in the first place.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make
    sense to me that anyone would buy a font they can't embed in a pdf or ePub document
    or convert formats if they need to, yet that seems to be how many are licensed.\r\n\r\nFree
    fonts are nice, especially since I'm a big fan of free open source software, but
    a lot of the fonts that I see that take my breath away are not free, and I would
    pay for them if I was allowed to actually use them the way a font should be used."

    others will disagree & give advice, but I think this sort of thing is best done
    by reading books, where the presentation has been gone over (over time, and way
    more than once) by an author, a set of editors checking for continuity as well
    as grammar, a compositor who just might read for content & query anything particularly
    wrong, etc. etc. \r\n\r\nAn internet forum is great for certain kinds of things,
    but IMO, not so good for detailed exposition. Nature of the kind of writing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    people could suggest some books or articles that would address the mechanics of
    how to make ideas work."

    Type 1 .pfb and Mac Type 1 LWFN are essentially obsolete formats, both replaced
    by OpenType CFF.\r\n\r\nThe weird part is using a DTP tool that requires a separate
    standalone metric file for every font file, and that it does not yet directly
    support OpenType CFF, which has been the dominant format for new fonts in print
    publishing for a decade now."
