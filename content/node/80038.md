  body: "Thanks Ricard0 but that's not quite it. The capital A, for instance, is quite
    different. While the type I'm looking for has a pointy top, Serif Gothic has a
    flat top. Similarly, Serif Gothic's capigal N angle is flat while the font I'm
    looking for has pointy angles.\r\nOther than that, it is very close.\r\n\r\n"
