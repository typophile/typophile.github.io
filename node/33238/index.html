<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I have WinME and IE 5.5 SP2.
I can't get TheSans Office from LucasFonts because the site won't work with IE 5.5. (It gets stuck in a loop after registration.)
I can't get the font from FontHaus because they sell (but don't list) TT on their site and want to charge me extra to buy via fax or mail.
I tried FontShop, but there are no scroll bars that I need to navigate the site. Strangely, their European and Australian sites don't have that problem, but I can't read German, and the prices are higher than $123.
Anybody know where I can purchase and download TheSans Office?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Why not send Luc a mail, he may be willing to process your order the old fashioned way.
Cheers, Si</div>

<div class=commentbody>Elena, thanks. I did email them, and they have been very kind. I'm sure Luc & Co. are honorable people, but it makes me nervous to do the currency conversion, write a check, mail it to Germany, await its receipt, and then wait for an email with a zip attachment. It's more convenient, safer, and faster to use a credit card and then to get an immediate download.
Stephen - I got to that page before. No scroll bars on any pages on that site in my browser, and (therefore) the registration page can't be filled out. I sent you an email with a screenshot to illustrate the problem.</div>

If foundries make it hard for people like me to buy fonts, it's my loss AND theirs. I thought foundries were in business to sell fonts.

<div class=commentbody>A friend of mine has an old PC running Windows ME, and Firefox works just fine on it. You won't need a new computer or a new OS. Just a few minutes to wait for the download and install process to be finished. Then, you should be able to buy just about anything from just about anybody.</div>

Well, thats a skewed perspective, I would say. :)
They don't make it hard for you, since the online shops and registration seems to be working for everyone else.

Your making a joke, right? Like when I get a message from one of the largest U.S. foundries saying ". . . since you wanted your password changed . . ." But I didn't. So when I called to make sure no identity theft was going on, after a 20 minute wait, the person can't help. Against policy. Then I get another email asking how my "experience" with my latest transaction went. Of course, the problem didn't fit the form, so had to be "other." No reply, after 2 months. Thank God Ellis Island messed up grandpa's name; there aren't too many other "Ellertson's" in the states.
Oh yes, I do use Firefox . . .</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ouch, Charles. That should never happen.
In regards to Steve's issue, I understand his frustration. He is probably able to access most sites without issue. Roadblocks like this one are unexpected. But these roadblocks will become more common as his browser ages.
IE 5.5 (released 7 years ago) sees the web much differently than modern browsers. Whenever a company updates their site, decisions need to be made about what features to include, some of which will disable compatibility with older software. In the end, the convenience of the vast majority of customers takes precedence over the smallest minority.
In FontShop's case, less than 0.1% of our visitors use IE 5.5. We make the (sometimes painful) decision to serve our largest customer base first, putting resources into more modern technologies, and then look to comply with least common browsers as time permits.
This is why <a href=http://www.webstandards.org/>web standards</a> are so vital. Standards-compliant web browsers should have a longer lifespan than those that are not.
All this said, keeping your software updated will always save you time and headaches in the long run. I echo the calls for using Firefox and keeping it up-to-date, which is surprisingly simple.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Stephen, I do understand that sooner or later I'll get a new computer with all the bells and whistles, but right now, mine works just fine, never had a virus, and get's me into 99% of sites where I want to go.
Having said that, FontShop Australia and those in Europe do not have the incompatibility that FontShop USA has, and apparently MyFonts and Phil'sFonts have designed their websites to be friendly to new AND old browsers.
LucasFonts not only won't work with my IE 5.5, but but I've been told (but I can't verify) that that it doesn't work with Macs either.
I appreciate Charles Ellertson's comment, because it puts the focus BACK where it belongs -- on the foundries and vendors. Those who would rather blame the "victims" than take responsibility will just lose business, or at least mine anyway, which is as it should be -- just as it is with the US auto industry.</div>

No, I'm not joking. I'd say what you are telling has little to do with compatability of websites with browsers.
Trying to access new websites that use fairly new technology with obsolete ancient browsers that do not support it, and complain when it does not work, is a whole different story all together. :)
No offence to anyone.</div>

It does. I still use old Mac OS 10.3.9 and Safari and Firefox and had no problem with online orders through this website.
As to the Mac version of IE, Microsoft neither distributes nor supports this app any more. I think this says it all.</div>
