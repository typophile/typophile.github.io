  body: Four days?! Blasphemy!  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>I lived there for about 6 months
    &#40;back in &#39;93&#41; and have been back twice for a few days, and it&#39;s
    my single most favorite city in this world. It&#39;s a place with design gushing
    out of every corner, and the people strike a unique balance between Western elegance
    and Old-World warmth. And there are about fifty &#34;The Restaurants&#34;... One
    I would recommend very highly is Cal Pep &#40;a tiny but superclassy shellfish
    place&#41;, off of Pla

    Las Ramblas. Even if you don&#39;t buy anything, it is a wonderful playground
    of colours and smells.
