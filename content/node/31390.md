    - a calligraphy font - so it looks handwritten?\r\n\r\nThere are many nice ones
    to choose from - you can also have them printed in a color that looks like ink.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck. Om Shanti."

    - I found an old engraver on West 27th Street - and had him engrave them for me.
    They were beautiful.\r\n\r\nEnrico doesn't have much time -- and I don't know
    if a calligrapher will be able to get them all done in time. I have always been
    a Plan B person -- always need to know the escape route...\r\n\r\nOtherwise, yes,
    a good letterer would do a bang-up job..."
