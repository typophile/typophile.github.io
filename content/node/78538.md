    a year during PBS fund drives.\r\n\r\nNote that the heading here and on YouTube
    has the title wrong: \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s \u201CPhonetic <em>Punctuation</em>,\u201D
    not <em>pronunciation</em>."

  body: "<cite> > What is PBS?</cite>\r\n\r\nOh, sorry; being US-centric there. PBS
    stands for \u201CPublic Broadcasting Service\u201D = American non-commercial broadcast
    television \u2014 hence the somewhat annoying fund drives throughout the year
    asking for financial contributions from the viewing public. During these periods,
    they often haul out good ol\u2019 audience favorites for re-broadcast, interrupted
    with frequent intermissions to make the pitches for pledges.\r\n\r\nVictor Borge
    is one of those perennials. He\u2019s got several classic and really hilarious
    routines (if you don\u2019t enjoy classical music, however, then many of the inside
    jokes might pass you by)."
