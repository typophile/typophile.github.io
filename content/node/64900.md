  body: When I see a font named after a place, I expect it to be a clone of something
    else. Apple started it all with their city fonts, and then Corel took it to a
    whole new level. I'd never name a font after a location.

  body: Technically, <em>Helvetia</em> means 'Switzerland' while <em>Helvetica</em>
    means 'Swiss'.  Which raises the question, are place name fonts more legitimate
    if they are 1. adjectives? 2. Latin? 3. Latin adjectives?
