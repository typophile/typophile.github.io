  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone, I&#39;m designing a calendar for the year 2005. Instead of having a traditional saints&#39; feast days, like those that can be seen on church calendars, I&#39;d like to try having a &#34;patron typographer,&#34; or something like that, for each day. Some of these typogragraphers/type designers would have further details/descriptions/portraits/work samples/etc., and some would only have their names listed. <BR> <BR>So, who has a &#34;patron saint,&#34; whose spirit they try to channel for inspiration? <BR> <BR>Conversely, does anyone have &#34;typographic demon,&#34; whose presence occasionally needs to be exorcised from your work? <BR> <BR>Dan</div>

Gill actually got paid some substantial fee for his contribution. But he dropped out before the project was finished. <BR> <BR>So Johnston Underground had substantial input from Gill, and therefore accusing Gill of &#34;ripping it off&#34; seems pretty goofy to me. <BR> <BR>That being said, I still have a lot of questions about his personal life that would lead me to think twice about considering him a typographic saint.

		<div class="commentbody">Apparently, the Pope is leaning towards declaring St Isidore of Seville &#40;7th century&#41; the patron saint of the Internet, following the lead of  Spanish catholics in 1999 who declared him Protector of the Internet. He produced the first encyclopaedia, among other things.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/Technology/News/0%2C" target="_blank">2-13-1443_1355345%2C00.html,http://www.news24.com/News24/Technology/News/0,,2-13-1443_1355345,00.html</a> <BR> <BR>&#34;All spiritual growth comes from reading and reflection. By reading we learn what we did not know; by reflection we retain what we have learned. &#34; &#40;from his Book of Maxims&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Oswald of Chicago: <BR> <BR>&#34;A quick way to have your type forgotten is to bore the reader with repetitions of some small cleverness.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Hybridizers have a moral responsibility...in crossing the calligraphic with the typographic.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Letters made odd deliberately are ill-at-ease and lead restricted lives.&#34;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, a year does have 365 days! Just like the Catholic Church&#39;s calendar of saints &#40;if that&#39;s what it is really called?&#41; My calendar will have saints days on many days &#40;like a third of them, so far&#41;. My list may not be long enough! Some saints are paired up on church calendars, too, making the list even longer. <BR> <BR>What I don&#39;t want to make is something like Pentagram&#39;s 2004 calendar. They got 12 designers &#40;living and dead&#41; picked. Each month has the days set in a different typeface. In addition to holidays, the 12 type designers birthdays are listed. That is a neat promo piece, but I&#39;m not going to learn anything new from it. I&#39;d like my calendar to be a bit more encyclopedic. <BR> <BR>Since we are on the subject of religion, let me issue a public mea culpa here for including GGL on my list!  <BR> <BR>Since this will be my calendar, the list sort of follows my interests. I don&#39;t think that I could hurt my own feelings  You&#39;ll notice that there are several &#34;Offenbachers&#34; on the list &#40;Klingspors, Koch, Hoefer&#41;, since I&#39;m studying there now, and am naturally interested on what happend there in the past.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to have to stay steadfast with Gill, though. His work has inspired me for years. Although he most certaintly was, in some regards, a shady character, we are only speaking about allegations here. He has been dead since 1940, and rumors have a funny way of spreading. If you give me definitive legal evidence that he molested children, or engaged in rampant beastiality, I&#39;ll take him off my list. Ok?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; Well, a year does have 365 days! <BR> <BR>Oh, I forgot about the calendar angle. Makes sense now. <BR> <BR>&#62; If you give me definitive legal evidence .... <BR> <BR>Although we can &#40;but probably shouldn&#39;t...&#41; define what &#34;molesting children&#34; or &#34;rampant bestiality&#34; mean exactly, it&#39;s pretty well admitted that he did engage in some &#40;mild?&#41; forms of those - the evidence is mostly in his own diaries! The &#34;child&#34; was his daughter, but it&#39;s not clear to me what a good minimum age is for a consenting adult. The dog on the other hand was probably too down-to-earth to have consented, but a dog is a dog; you should see what &#34;respectable&#34; people do to cows in preparing hamburger patties... And the good news for Gill is that he wasn&#39;t <i>unflinching</i> about it - he does seem to have had an internal struggle and remorse. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was the one who brought it up, and it was basically a reaction to the phrase &#34;patron saint,&#34; which I think can be reasonably believed to imply that someone is of good character &#40;whatever the heck that is&#41;. <BR> <BR>Although many of us keep our professional and private lives separate, Gill didn&#39;t very much at all. I mean, some of his students who studied under Gill, really &#42;studied under&#42; Gill, if you get my drift. <BR> <BR>If we&#39;d been asked whose work we found most inspirational and admired most, I&#39;d have had absolutely no qualms about seeing Gill on the list. <BR> <BR>Dan may very well have meant &#34;patron saint&#34; to mean no more than that, of course. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;m out of line in thinking that its more literal meaning can be seen as flavoring the concept a little. <BR> <BR>T</div>

Sure, that&#39;s the association &#34;Saint&#34; usually has, but then what about the title of Cabarga&#39;s book: &#34;Logo, Font and Lettering Bible&#34;? <BR> <BR>And what about Griffo? He was hanged for the murder of his son-in-law. And Goudy was a certifiable skirt-chaser. And Koch was a woman-hater. And Beatrice Warde was a husband-swapper who caused Frederic to hang himself&#42;. And hey, don&#39;t let me start on friggin&#39; Louis XIV!! Gill simply made the mistake of keeping a diary. <BR> <BR>&#42; Speaking of which, Dan, you really need to add Cassandre. Even though he hung himself because a font house rejected his designs - what a lousy Catholic, eh? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
