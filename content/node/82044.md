body: so i have been hearing recently from people call fonts modern classic and i'm
  confused. isn't the term classic for old things like Bodoni. also can something
  be modern and classic at the same time, could you explain please. when does a modern
  thing become classic and is it correct to call something created in the year 2011
  a classic? thank you very much!

  body: "Hi Claire. 'Classic' does not necessarily have a very good definition anymore,
    within or without the type world. At its core, classic denotes timelessness, or
    being of a quality by which all subsequent works are measured. If something were
    produced today that fit those standards, it may then be considered a 'modern classic,'
    but this term itself is as you point out kind of silly because of its paradoxical
    nature and general overuse (and misuse).\r\nTo further complicate the issue, pair
    that with typographic classification systems that use the same or similar words\u2014<em>classical</em>
    describing the renaissance & post-renaissance Roman types, <em>modern</em> describing
    romantic faces such as Bodoni's and Didot's, <em>modern</em> describing a high-contrast
    Scotch Roman as seen in faces such as <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/\">De
    Vinne</a>, <em>modern</em> describing futurist types such as Futura, <em>modern</em>
    describing any types that coincided with the artistic movement called 'modernism,'
    and <em>modern</em> describing anything done recently."

  body: Classic? Oh, that's the pop stuff that's good enough to survive for long enough.
    That's where real classical music comes from. The garaldes and bodonis, too. ABBA,
    The Beatles and LedZep are there already, as is Univers.

    can be classic, in the sense that it adopts a venerable style, but it can never
    be <em>a</em> classic until a suitable period of time has elapsed.\r\n\r\nWith
    music, classics are works that have been interpreted many times, over time. Perhaps
    the same meaning can be applied to typefaces."

    <em>a</em> classic?\r\nIt's a revival of 1928 typeface in a classical style (i.e.
    strongly informed by Roman inscriptions from classical antiquity), but that typeface
    disappeared from use within 20 years, fallen from fashion and not transitioned
    into technologies subsequent to letterpress, until this year, therefore by no
    means classic."

    A possible niche classic.

    was considered \"modern\" by the designers <em>ante litteram</em> themselves.\r\nSomething

  body: My standards may be (and likely will be) different from y'alls' in that I
    consider a classic (<em>n.</em>) to be something man-made that can and/or has
    survived virtually unchanged for a period of time while affecting things around
    them. Okay, that's a right broad stroke, but that's the essence of it. The Speccy,
    the Commie, the Beeb; I see them as classics among home computers. Others would
    no doubt want to add Vicky and the Apple 2 to their list. /* Sinclair ZX Spectrum,
    Commodore 64 and Acorn's BBC Computer. Commodore VIC 20. */
