  body: "Bigger problem: not free. FontForge is free - is it the only one? But AFAIK
    it's a bear to get to work right.\r\n\r\nCaprice, if you can come up with $100
    this\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/\r\nis worth it. And if you're
    a student the FontLab people have deals for you.\r\n\r\nBTW, you haven't actually
    created a font yet. :-)  Just a bunch of letterforms. The dark side awaits...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
