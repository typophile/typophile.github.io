    E. Smith's Park Avenue (1933)</a>.\r\n\r\nPlease don't take this as \"oh so it's
    alright to ask type id's here after all\". There is an entire section of this
    forum dedicated to it, as described above."

    it says\r\n\r\n<blockquote>All topics are welcome<strong>\u2014except font ID
    requests.<strong></blockquote>\r\n\r\n...though not in boldface. Do we really
    need bold?\r\n\r\nChris, how about some printer's fists!"

  body: "Poor unsuspecting gustbiz may have landed inside this particular forum by
    just googling \"type id\".\r\n\r\nOh wait .. top hit for that exact phrase (ignoring
    the false positive the \"typeid\" C++) is .. \"Type ID Board | Typophile\", Well,
    then I don't know."
