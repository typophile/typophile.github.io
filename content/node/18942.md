  body: I've not seen this exact font before. It appears to be, however, a somewhat
    simplified (really) version of a typeface originally called Fournier Geperlt (Pierre
    Simon Fournierlejeune, 1712 - 1768). A later foundry resurrection called it Dresden
    (P.A. Demeter, 1922). The only digital versions I know of are, unfortunately,
    from questionable sources. The notorious Southern Software offered it as Trellis
    Display Caps. The German knockoff company Softmaker has it as Dresden and someone
    created a decent lowercase for it and called it <a href="http://valgraphics.net/Fonts/MyFavFonts/myfav4.html"
    target="_blank">Weinbeck</a>.

  body: "No, it looks like you called it perfectly, Tiffany. Dreseden was an actual
    typeface, whereas Bodoni Classic Floral Initials are, according to Gert Wiescher's
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/bodoni-initials/\" target=\"_blank\">writeup
    at MyFonts</a>, his own creation. To me, they have a great deal in common with
    Dresden, though. Nice find!\r\n\r\nWiescher has done lots of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=wiescher+bodoni\"
    target=\"_blank\">playing with Bodoni</a>, BTW."

  body: The video is mesmerizing, in a Hee-Haw kind of way (may be the first that
    phrase was ever used). I have listened about 20 times to it and it doesn't get
    old. The twins are supposed to look serious, but when the guitar player gets too
    close to the one on the right, you can see she is about one joke away from cracking
    up.
