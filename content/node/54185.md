body: Hi all, was interested to see if anyone has ever come across examples of ligated
  forms involving punctuation. ideas that spring to mind would be apostrophe + lower
  s and o + apostrophe.  surely given the long and rich history of type design and
  experimentation, there should be some great examples out there.

    which is a single letter in Vietnamese.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: I've not seen a ligature involving punctuation before, and to what purpose?
    I always imagined that the real purpose of ligatures was because of overlap of
    characters, like ff, and fi...st and ct ligatures are nice to look at but the
    function is aesthetic. I really can't think of a reason why you would have to
    link a punctuation mark with a letter.  Mind you, this is for English, maybe in
    other languages, the written form gives more leeway(?) for such ligations.

    I'd love to see an example.

    a price, but what else is new?\r\n\r\nFor example ligating the question mark in
    single-word questions might be very nice. Another thing to think about is ligating
    the opening question/exclamation marks in Spanish.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    glyphs are ligatures involving digits and the division slash.

  body: "I like hrants idea of single word questions.  The possibilities are also
    nice given that question words in Spanish are accented: \xBFQu\xE9? \xBFQui\xE9n?
    \ \xBFCu\xE1l?  etc.  Given the direction of the accent and the curvature of the
    closing mark... also the tail of the Q could potentially be ligated with the bottom
    of the opening mark, but it might look a bit off, given that it's common* to stretch
    the tail out to the e.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas

    not today given that publishers use eerything off the shelf, but it certainly
    was widely used in other time periods, even if not perhaps receiving majority
    use."

  body: "Hrant, I was not aware that OT was the starting point for anything new under
    the sun. The point I'm dancing and drumming around, waiting for either Ginger
    Rogers or Ginger Baker to join in on, is that punctuation is normally, (and this
    is a long, old and wide normality), designed, spaced, and composed to stand apart
    and be noticed, not ligated into the word, or blended like a frappe.\r\n\r\nI
    have recently designed, spaced and kerned a terminal swash e that embraces .!?,
    but I left a wide berth for recognition in the composition for the reasons I've
    stated above. I would love to see some appropriate use of OT for making better
    l.c., u.c or figure specific punctuation, especially in faces with divergent parameters
    between character groups, like fonts with very small x-hts, large differences
    in uc/lc weight or widths, but I think of this as involving non-ligaturish design.\r\n\r\nCheers
    and thanks, if you meant something nice above.\r\n\r\n"
