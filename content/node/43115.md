  experience with printing. I am particularly interested in getting recommendations
  on the size of the margins to avoid printing issues. \r\n\r\nHere are my specs:\r\nPages:
  288 pages\r\nInside Margin: 0.5 inches\r\nOutside: 0.25 inches\r\nTop: 0.25 inches\r\nBottom:
  0.5 inches\r\n\r\nIn many of the books and websites I've read, it seems 0.5 inches
  is the minimum margin recommendation for all sides. However, when I look at my favorite
  design books, some of them cut it quite close with less than 0.25 inches margin.
  I like my book to have an outside margin of 0.25 inches. How do I make sure the
  printer doesn't overtrim the document down beyond 0.25 inches?\r\n\r\nthanks in
  advance!"

    I would put it down again immediately as an abomination. Add to that that the
    inner margin is double the outer margin, whereas it should be the other way round
    if anything, and I think you have a recipe for disaster.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents."

    don't understand printing. You can be a <cite>stylist</cite> like the people who
    put ever-larger tailfins on late 1950s automobiles.\r\n\r\nIf it is a sheet-fed
    press, the fingers need some gripping room. Call the printer & ask; just which
    margin & how much depends on the press & workflow. But of course, printers can
    print full bleeds on 4 sides (3, really), so you don't absolutely have to have
    margins at all. Usually, full bleed costs more, if for an entire book.\r\n\r\n<cite>when
    I look at my favorite design books, some of them cut it quite close with less
    than 0.25 inches margin. I like my book to have an outside margin of 0.25 inches,</cite>\r\n\r\nWell,
    you'll have a pleased audience of at least one. Probably a few more, since you've
    apparently seen other design books that use .25 inch margins.\r\n\r\nIf you are
    talking about how far pictures can extend into a margin, that is one thing. If
    you are talking about text, quite another.\r\n\r\nMost book designers take their
    task as presenting the author's work. From the tenor of your post, you seem to
    see the job of designing differently.\r\n\r\nCharles Ellertson"

  body: ".25\" margin is generally considered safe, but I have to agree with Eluard
    that it's crazy tight. What is your trim size? What kind of book is it, an illustrated
    book or a reading book? If the former you may be able to pull it off, if the latter
    your readers will probably hate you. I really wouldn't put text that close to
    the edge of the page. Pictures... well ok if you insist.\r\n\r\nYour inside margin
    should be a little more, as you've specified, to avoid the text falling into the
    gutter, but depending on how it's being bound, 1/2\" might be tight as well. "

  body: "The only place I have seen quarter inch margins is in paper backs (the cheapies)
    where they are trying to cram as much into the page as possible. Less than a quarter
    and bad trimming/folding can cut text off. A quarter inch is 1.5 picas ... I like
    to see the text indent that wide, let alone the margin.\r\n\r\n> How do I make
    sure the printer doesn\u2019t overtrim the document down beyond 0.25 inches?\r\n\r\nPray.

    books pages in the final trim, based upon paperthickness and location of pages
    in a section \u2014 excuse my poor english) by reducing the innermargins. So your
    outer margin can be safe and steady\u2026 \r\nBut I concurr with other respondents
    here: a quarter of an inch is dangerously little. Especially when you take into
    account the common practice of libraries to rebind (in hardcover) a lot of books,
    which requires an extra trim.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: "Due to exigencies of large-scale printing and production, most book printers
    will cite as much as 0.125 inch to be an acceptable tolerance in trimming and
    recommend that any element that is not intended to bleed should be *at least*
    0.25 inch from the trim. If you want that margin to appear consistent throughout
    the book, I'd make it larger. Not every printer imposes with adequate compensation
    for creep.\r\n\r\nRegarding inner margin, the safest bet is always to get a dummy
    from the manufacturer and evaluate your page design in relation to the physical
    object. My gut tells me that half an inch is too tight.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: My books, however bound, always have .75 to one inch left and right margins
    and never less. Hardbacks open fairly flat but paperback binding really chews
    up the inside margin space and the reader needs the extra relief. In my view,
    .25" inside gutter is totally wrong and you're just asking for trouble.

  body: "To my knowledge there's nothing like a universal minimum margin in modern
    book design, at least in a technical way. It mostly depends on the means you are
    going to use for printing, binding, etc. and what you consider would be comfortable
    for the reader. Find out how it is going to be printed and ask about limitations,
    if you can have bleeding, etc. If possible see examples, ask questions, make tests.\r\n\r\nIf
    you like to define a harmonic margin structure look for known proportions, they
    can give you a good starting point: medieval, 3/4, there are many \"formulas\"...
    it would also be a good start to define the page, margins, and everything in picas
    and points - it will make things easier when defining line heights, typography
    and overall measures.\r\nAlso look for books in similar sizes, it will give you
    an idea of how the margins, type and space look and feel.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kind
    of book is it anyway, is it an illustrated/art book?\r\n\r\nRegards,"

  body: Gabriel - I asked that same question (what kind of book). Daiukun has not
    revisited this thread since launching it. Perhaps he didn't get the answers he
    wanted.
