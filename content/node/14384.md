body: "Can anyone recommend me a book on how to creat a type? I've been looking for
  it for such a long time. It is NOT a book to teach me how to use Fontographer, not
  a book to teach me how to lettering; BUT a book containing wisdom and experience
  of the precursors in the type history, a book containing detailed materials of how
  curves and edges have been made in that way.\r\n\r\nBooks can be found on Amazon
  or United States would be preffered. Thanks a lot."
