body: I have been lucky to be able to get Doyald Young's two larger tomes "Logos and
  Fonts" and "Logotypes and Letterforms" from my Library. Hooray for Interlibrary
  loan! I have enjoyed reading about his fights with spacing issues such as when a
  logo includes an All Cap "LA" Combination. He sensibly shortens the lower bar of
  the L. He also explains that it was for even color that he loses the pot hook on
  top of the "i" in a script "riu" combination. And he extends the lower bar of a
  "z" with a swash to fill the void of a "v" in "rendezvous". These adjustments are
  all in logos meant to catch the eye, although each of these adds some optical evenness
  to the designs as well. I think these books might be instructive for Opentype display
  type makers with a mind to make contextual alternates, or maybe with some special
  care - Opentype text face makers as well.

  body: "I have read only \"Fonts and Logos,\" which I also own. It's one of the books
    I've learned most from about type. \r\n\r\nAs to adjusting letter pairs in text
    type: It is a good idea, but the problem for a font, as opposed to a logo, is
    that there is no end to it. So it is hard to know where to start and stop, beyond
    using open type to rectify 'f' problems, such as has been discussed recently in
    another thread.\r\n\r\nThe lesson I took away from Young for text type is the
    importance of getting the letter forms themselves right, so that they color well
    in context of all--well almost all!--the other letters.  "

  body: "<cite> I work for a company with two cap As in the name. </cite> \r\n\r\nDepending
    on the font chosen that might be okay... But I am guessing Doyald would make an
    AA ligature.\r\n\r\nBill, you are I think, spot on where Doyald's sense is as
    far as fonts and special cases. But then there was no Open type when he wrote
    these books. It's time to question the tradition. Maybe it will hold up. Maybe
    it won't. But Doyald insights do ( I think ) show us some opportunities for where
    we might begin that questioning process. \r\n\r\nAlso, based on my own experiments
    so far, the list of combinations that we might consider seriously isn't infinite.
    It's somewhat daunting, but by no means undoable. And it offers yet another chance
    to increase quality by letting the eye settle things. Supposing that I could show
    you a list of say 16 situations and offer a compelling justification for making
    a contextual alternative for each one. Would you consider implementing it? If
    this were the case, it would be a smaller job than doing even a single optical
    size. No? "

  body: "Antonio, I am glad you found it helpful! \r\n\r\nMy take is pretty narrow
    as reported. I am reading the books with a specific purpose - which wasn't (I
    am nearly sure) his in writing them. \r\n\r\nBut outside of my own purpose I am
    also curious to hear what everybody thinks in general. I had heard some big praise
    so I had to check them out. I will also admit that while I think his stuff is
    amazingly strong, the aesthetic he works in isn't my favorite. It's very interesting
    seeing these styles being done well. I think his stuff was imitated poorly for
    years."

  body: ">Supposing that I could show you a list of say 16 situations and offer a
    compelling justification for making a contextual alternative for each one. Would
    you consider implementing it?\r\n\r\nSome fonts don't even require f ligatures,
    so I think I think that the benefit of contextual alternatives would depend on
    the style of the font. In general, I think lower case to lower case should require
    relatively little kerning, if the letters are well designed. Also I favor a style
    with slightly looser letter spacing than in many fonts, so again that reduces
    the likely benefit of contextual alternatives in the lower case. \r\n\r\nFor other
    cases, where it will make a difference, I'm yet to be convinced that it will make
    a big enough difference in text to undertake the initiative and put in the work,
    aside from the 'f' issues. But I'm willing to be persuaded by examples you or
    others may post. "

  body: Bill, you are right that wider spacing begins to obviate the need or value
    of a contextual alternative. I will not be posting the list just yet. But I will
    show you them in Buffalo I hope. I am not sure I will convince you or anyone.
    But I will make the best case I have then. I was asking a theoretical question
    in order to sound out the limits of your potential interest.

  body: "Not yet Eben. Doyald wrote me (himself, very kind!) that they will be mailed
    priority either on the 4th or on the 7th morning. Unfortunately I just had a bad
    experience with stuff being sent priority from the USA. I ordered <cite>Masters
    of the Italic Letter</cite> by Kathryn A. Atkins from AbeBooks. The ordered was
    handled by a book shop in New York, but despite ordering it with priority shipping
    on the 9th of October I only got it last week. The combination of the holiday
    season and the crappy Italian postage system got in the way, I guess. So I fear
    it might take a while before I can actually get Doyald Young\u2019s books."
