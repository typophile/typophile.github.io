  Singapore"> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s likely to be handdrawn, but there&#39;s also a high
  chance that it is a freeware something, or even a commercial font, which I hope
  someone can point out. <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s handdrawn, I&#39;m interested to know
  if there are any fonts out there which this could be based on. <BR> <BR>The sans
  that they have chosen is Shinn Medium. <BR> <BR>Any kind of pointers / comments
  would be appreciated. Thanks guys. <BR> <BR>

    <i>How</i>. But maybe it&#39;s not fair to compare since that exercise was focused
    on designing a typeface, while this is a &#39;rebranding&#39; exercise. <BR> '
