  (for my amateurish attempts at letterpress) and am wondering if this exists in a
  digital version? I have looked through Mike Yanega's script guide but I confess
  I got lost in the bewildering array of formal script typefaces there.\r\n\r\nAttached
  is a sample from the Riscatype catalogue. Many thanks in advance!"

    the closest I found were Derby and Diskus, but neither was a match. This is a
    new one to me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
