body: I have just been chatting to a mate about purchasing type. He said &#34;I would
  buy typefaces because they are made in New Zealand.&#34; It made me wonder whether
  anyone else would buy type according to it&#39;s country of origin. Is patriotism
  a factor? <BR> <BR>kris <BR>

  body: Perhaps I can sqeeze them into a Dune Beetle :D <BR> <BR>The more I thought
    about the original post, the more obvious it became to me that I have no predisposition
    to purchasing particular fonts because of who made them or their country of origin.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll site Cottingly as one of my alltime favorite typefaces and its
    designer hails from the UK. <BR> <BR>See! Simple as that! It&#39;s also hard to
    ignore a successful typeface like Fontesque from our pal Nick Shinn up in Canada.
    It&#39;s become an incredibly popular display face in the US. <BR> <BR>I guess
    a great typeface is a great typeface and I&#39;d personally be reluctant to go
    out of my way to find a &#34;local&#34; homerolled version of something that already
    is exactly what I want. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s my opinion when it comes to purchasing
    type. Regarding other products I purchase, I think I may have a bias due to regionality,
    relationship to my personal background, etc. - less &#39;legitimate&#39; reasons
    and more &#39;gut&#39; reasons. <BR> <BR>Hopefully I&#39;m not going too far into
    a tangent, but I think my purchase decisions are based mostly on historical purchase
    experiences, sense of value for amount paid, packaging/ambiance, and cost.

    think it should be a criterea for choosing a typeface. Design, legibility and
    visual qualities should. Choosing a font because it&#39;s local is like choosing
    it for it&#39;s name. Or only designing stuff in your local-football-team-colours.

    . . . <BR> <BR>Say I&#39;m an Art Director in Toronoto and I want to capture the
    regional flavor. Chances are I&#39;d want to use a face that reflects that flavor
    and more than likely it&#39;d be a face developed locally. <BR> <BR>The job of
    an Art Director is to do as much as they can to influence a purchase decision
    to &#39;joe public&#39; to buy what they are creating advertising for. If &#39;joe
    public&#39; lives in a specific region, I&#39;d be a fool not to design work that
    they can relate to visually. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s part of that whole advertising,
