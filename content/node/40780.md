body: "The can of refreshing Fonta&reg; comes from a guest-lecture I did in spring
  2007 at Stockport College, regarding the abundance of type in everyday life. I produced
  many other similar illustrations for the lecture, which I might dig out and post
  on here at some point. The entire lecture was hurriedly assembled because I spent
  far too much time on typeface selection for the projected slides. Finally, however,
  I decided to use my most recent type acquisition at that time, Xavier Dupr&eacute;\u2019s
