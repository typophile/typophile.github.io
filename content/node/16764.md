body: "I just found this WWII anti-Nazi propaganda poster on the National Archives
  site.  What surprised me was how contemporary it is in styling.  It looks more like
  a 1990s poster for a social cause on a college campus than it does 1940s propaganda.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.archives.gov/exhibits/powers_of_persuasion/this_is_nazi_brutality/images_html/this_is_nazi_brutality.html\r\n\r\nIn
  any case, does anyone know what typeface was used for the red headline?  It looks
  strikingly like Franklin Gothic Condensed, but was that around in the 1940s?  It's
  so unlike the typefaces seen on other propaganda posters of the era.  It's partially
  because of this that it looks so contemporary, I think."

  body: Franklin Gothic is from around 1906. In the poster, it looks like it has been
    hand rendered, as part of the art. It's slighly "off."

  body: It also bears a strong resemblance to the old Mergenthaler Linotype Gothic
    No. 16. I don't know whether or not it has been digitized.
