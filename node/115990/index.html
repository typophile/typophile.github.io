  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all,

I am new to the forums and hoping to get some much needed advice. 

I am in the business of writing formal reports that convince the reader of a particular argument - much like a lawyer just not as ultra formal. I currently use Calibri but I have decided to search for a different sans serif font as I have read that system fonts are generally poorly designed. 

I seek a sans serif font which is versatile enough to be used on screen and in print whilst holding the readers attention and maintaining legibility over long body copy. I would like a sans serif font that is interesting but maintains a certain degree of formality so as to remain credible.  

I came across MVB Solitaire which seems to have had good reviews. I would greatly welcome any other suggestions from the community. 

Your advice is very much appreciated. 

Many thanks

I must admit that I don't dislike Calibri, however, as you say, setting my work apart from the ordinary is desirable. 

Could you recommend any alternatives to MVB Solitaire that would be worth considering ? To elaborate I am looking at redesigning my company's document framework (I have taken some pointers from Matthew Butterick's Practical Typography to try and enhance readability) and the last piece of the puzzle seems to be the font. Cost may be an issue so although paid professional fonts are sought after I would also welcome any affordable / free font recommendations.

Thank you for the reply. I've read your review and you state "The central styles are spaced a little on the tight side for immersive reading. They are, however, ideal for shorter stretches of text, or a supp­or­ting role in a bigger hierarchy." This suggests that such a font, in your opinion, would not be useful for my intended purposes i.e. long persuasive reports. Would this be an accurate interpretation ?

		<div class="commentbody">You are correct. That is my opinion. 

I’ve never typeset a book in a sans serif, but I have been using Fresco Sans for a magazine in a supportive role. It has a lot of flavour, which might be a dealbreaker, but the spacing is impeccable: ideal for text sizes. If you’re typesetting Norwegian, you’ll need to make some modifications though (obtain permission, or hire the foundry to do them).

Another typeface I have worked with that I consider suitable for extended text is FF Legato.

Some other sans serifs I’d like to look closer at in the future includes FF Milo, Seravek, FF Balance, DTL Haarlemmer Sans and DTL Documenta Sans.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Besides making a font more readable, serifs are formal and elaborate (while sans fonts are informal and plain). You need such characteristic to persuade.

An obvious choice here is Georgia. It's very functional, and persuasive, but it's used for so many things that it's not very focused (if that matters).

		<div class="commentbody">Beware of blanket statements like "all sans fonts are informal and plain" - a good sans can project a sense of  modernity and clarity. And on the other hand serifs can be stiff and fussy and project more of a schoolbook vibe. Readability and serifs is still an open discussion - well set sans can be very readable. Georgia, by the way, is a strong font and could be persuasive, but then I have seen Gill Sans do a good job as well. </div>

Best done by the writing, not the font selection. 

That said, I agree with Thomas that it would be interesting to see Hypatia used in this context. Haven't seen or done this, though, We've only used Hypatia for display, where it worked very well indeed.

A proven font family would be TheSans, using either the regular or semi-light for text. (We've set a number of art books with TheSans.) Of course, since it is proven, it's not the newest fad.

That's like somebody asking for an opinion on a book he's written on a book review forum, and being told that a career choice comes first. This is Typophile, so the context is type. Chips on shoulders are best be left at the door.

TheSans is a great design, but if it works well for an art book* it can't be a very good choice for this task. Specifically, I think it's too informal, too friendly here.

* Central question: what kind of art? There's no way one typeface can be great for all genres.
