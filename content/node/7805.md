body: Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>yes Fontlab is the best font-editor?, but I&#39;m having
  so much troubles with the program. Is it the system &#40;OSX 10.3.6&#41; or is it
  me?, I&#39;m having a legal copy. The people at Fontlab can&#39;t help me much,
  maybe there is someone who can help me?, th last few weeks I cannot start up Fontlab
  &#40;4.6&#41;, the programs starts up but halfway after the message &#39;caching
  ATSUI fonts&#39; the program quit. I&#39;ve tried to start up in OS9 and OSX. <BR>
  <BR>Anyone knows what the problem could be?, at fontlab they suggested to reinstall
  the system, but that is to much for me, <BR> <BR>thanks in advance <BR> <BR>greetings
  <BR> <BR>zoe

  body: It sounds like a typical problem with permissions. So rebuild the whole disc.
    It&#39;s something you should do every now and then on OSX. <BR> <BR>You could
    also try to de-install Fontlab and thrash the prefrence file, then re-install
    Fontlab again. <BR> <BR>I ahve no Idea what ATSUI is. <BR> <BR>I had a similar
    problem with another software before &amp; rewritting permissions helped.

  body: Zoe,  <BR> <BR>since FontLab crashes os &#34;caching ATSUI fonts&#34;, this
    is an indication that your system has some activated fonts that are causing FontLab
    to crash. We recommend installing a font manager such as Suitcase or Font Agent,
    or using the built-in FontBook and disable some fonts.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam
