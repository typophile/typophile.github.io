    that it gives equal space to accomplished typographers and people with lesser
    levels of proficiency (like myself:) \r\n\r\nYour logo looks sort of techie and
    futuristic. Klavika, with its slightly angular lines, might be a good choice of
    typeface.  \r\n\r\nWhat sort of applications would you mostly have?"

  body: "Hi Arun,\r\n\r\nThank you for your advice, indeed Klavika looks likes a great
    choice.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant by feeling out of my league is that I usually use
    the TypeID sub-forum, mostly for my clients, they are clueless when it comes to
    typography. I deal with communications through audio-video (video production)
    so fonts and typefaces are not usually of daily concerns.\r\n\r\nWhen you say
    \"What sort of applications would you mostly have?\" I think you mean how will
    I use it? Well it will mostly be for official short contract or business offers
    documents that I will create and type myself, that is until I can afford a secretary
    :)\r\n\r\nDo you think Klavika would be appropriate?\r\n\r\nThanks you very much
    for your time.\r\n\r\nPhil\r\n\r\nps. Any thoughts you may have on the logo itself
    well be apprecited :)"

  body: "Glad if it is useful to you :)\r\n\r\nBy applications I meant things on which
    the logo would appear - a brochure, a website, a poster etc.\r\n\r\nFor business
    corresondence there's no reason why Klavika shouldn't work. \r\n\r\nHowever, if
    you need to make a lot of powerpoint or html pages, then there probably is some
    wisdom in choosing a typeface that comes default with Windows. For instance, Trebuchet.
    \r\n\r\nThis is because such applications typically may have to be viewed in computers
    other than your's where something like Klavika may not be installed. "

    mistake of using a less common typeface (rage italic, my favorite) on my website
    and quickly found out that not a lot of visitors weren't able to view it correctly.\r\n\r\nAny
    comments on my logo by the way, I read a few critics that you made in other posts
    and found them quite constructive. I won't take it personnal.\r\n\r\nThis design
    was inspired by the old movie countdown.\r\n\r\nPhil"

  body: "I'd be happy to comment on the logo, but I think I'm quite removed from your
    context. I'll just point out a few things that are not very clear to me looking
    at your logo.  \r\n\r\nAt first look, the language and composition of the logo
    look rather like a radio station. Is that intentional?  In spite of all that we
    say about thinking out-of-the-box, in my experience, most categories of business
    have fairly well defined looks. It could be a little disorientating for your audiences
    if it is very diferent from the visual language of others in this category.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure what FPS mean (Film Production Services?). Again unless its universally
    known in your line of work, I'd prefer to have a clearer descriptor. Also what
    exactly is teh name of your business: is it Production 24, FPS or Production 24
    FPS?\r\n\r\nIs Countdown the one on the moon mission? If yes, is that reference
    relevant to what you want to communicate?\r\n\r\nThe metallic effect is quite
    well-rendered. But if you're going to do most of your printing on your office
    printer, then better substitute it with flat tones. Unless again, it has a key
    resonance that I'm not seeing. \r\n\r\nWill the logo always have the same blue
    background in exactly the same proportions, or have you also created a straight
    version (on white background)?  On a letterhead, for instance, the latter may
    carry greater impact.\r\n\r\nThe background colour itself looks a little muddy,
    at least on my not-so-state-of-art monitor. Try taking a print and check whether
    you want to tweak the CMYK values to make it a cleaner, crisper blue. I think
    cutting down on the Yellow would make it better. \r\n\r\nI think that's enough
    for now; I hope you've learnt your lesson not to ask strangers to nitpick on your
    work ;)\r\n \r\n"

  body: "Hi Fellas,\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed that is what \"fps\" means. It is a cinema term,
    I understand when you say it could lead to some confusion but in the two years
    I had my company I think I never met anybody who didn't have a big question mark
    above their heads once I introduce myself and my company name. \r\n\r\nThe good
    thing is that it allows me to quickly teach them something, a real ice breaker.
    The question mark is usually replaced by a smile.\r\n\r\nI do have the logo on
    a white background, it is this one that I use in my documents. Here it is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo
    blanc_5441.JPG]\r\n\r\nMind you this is not final, obviously some outlines will
    have to be added as the word \"production\" doesn't really stick out.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the muddy effect I don't think is has anything to do with your monitor, it
    is probably the low-res jpeg version I use to upload in this post.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I say the inspiration was the old countdown I meant this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/countdown_5343.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    didn't learn any lesson Arun I think everything you said was pertinent and well-founded.
    It is not my work but my designer's. I deal with moving images not stills :)\r\n\r\nAnything
    you want to add feel free to do so, by the way a link to some of your work would
    interest me very much.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, \r\n \r\nPhil"

  body: "\"The question mark is usually replaced by a smile...\"\r\n\r\nIt's really
    good if your logo is a conversation starter. In that case you probably have a
    strong case to make 24 and FPS in the same size. I think it'll more readily evoke
    that initial curiosity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"When I say the inspiration was the old countdown
    I meant this:\"\r\n\r\nI feel that reference is a little hidden. If you want countdown
    to be your concept then the cues perhaps need to be a little clearer. Probably
    just have the number within the circle device and have the rest of the text clearly
    outside. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Anything you want to add feel free to do so...\"\r\n\r\nJust
    spent a few minutes playing around with type, Do take a look:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/24FPS_1_4918.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/24FPS_2_6463.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/24FPS_3_4469.jpg]"
