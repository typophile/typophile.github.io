    And I'd avoid negative response given that you're trying to get positive attention
    for yourself. ;)\r\n\r\nNice job. Can't wait to see the finals. "

  body: "Ok, sorry I just stand up for what I believe in, love and enjoy. I can't
    wait till this is done! The TYPEFAcE Will be for download on Oct 31st if every
    thing goes as planned, in vector format. I also love lettering, type, and type
    and more type in general. I enjoy a dieing trade called pinstriping and lettering,
    designing and pinstriping are my past times.\r\nThats what I can't wait to upload!
    My old skool style lettering! Not a bunch of fake dudes in front of a computer
    making VECTOR swirls.\r\n\r\nI SWEAT MY BUT OFF IN THE HEAT WITH ENAMEL PAINT
    IN MY EYES AND WATCH SOME FAG ON A COMPUTER MAKE HIS SWIRLS ( I DO THE SAME THING,
    BUT I ALSO DO THE REAL THING)\r\n\r\nNE-WAYS I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF, MY
    WORK DOSE. \r\n\r\n\r\nJerry Rose\r\nwww.illustrativetype.com\r\nwww.luxandrose.com"

    lot of \"fake dudes\" here. Screaming at us all and badmouthing our [digital]
    work unnecessarily detracts from showcasing your own."

  body: A genuine question - if your ultimate goal is to release this in vector format,
    why would you not start on the computer? As far as critique, I have none, the
    letters are lovely and fascinating.
