  one late nineties and 2000.\r\nSeen a thousand times but I don\u2019t remember the
  name.\r\nSeems similar also to OCR but it isn\u2019t exactly.\r\n\r\nHelp is very
  much appreciated!\r\n\r\nStefan"

  body: "Hi Bob!\r\n\r\nThanks for stepping in!\r\nYeah, indeed, it is quite close,
    I guess. I saw Cholla also this morning, but what irritates is that i.g. \u2018n\u2019
    seems to be wider than \u2018e\u2019 in the font in the image (I know it is very
    poor, for this I have to rebuild it) and also \u2018y\u2019 seems to have kind
    of tail below.\r\nFurther it seems the case that \u2018w\u2019 has partly straight
    wings on the upper side (like it is in OCR i.g.) Then also (but I don\u2019t know
    to tell the truth) I am not sure that this font already existed at the time of
    the image (very early 2000).\r\nBut for the rest (\u2018n\u2019 with narrowed
    connections to stem, also in \u2018b\u2019, \u2018l\u2019 without serif and so
    on) it is an almost perfect match so I will use it to rebuild the lines I need!\r\nThanks
    very much! Have a good time!\r\nStefan"

  body: Cholla, copyrighted 1999 - and the n thing bugged me too, but blur of sample
    maybe uneven.
