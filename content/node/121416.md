  brief collection of (somewhat hostile) opinions I\u2019ve seen:\r\n1. Apple, are
  you seriously making a mimicry of Roboto, which the typographic community have despised
  for a million times?\r\n2. Apple, are you seriously copying prevalent neo-grotesks
  like Akkurat or LL Circular? (This rhetorical question is followed usually by an
  onslaught against Apple\u2019s degraded moral integrity.)\r\n3. Apple, your copycat
  neo-grotesk is done so badly, it\u2019s like Arial when in comparison with Helvetica.\r\n4.
  Apple, are you out of your ideas? Another Helvetica mimicry? I was waiting for a
  more original design and you\u2019ve disappointed me.\r\n5. For no reason, sans-serifs
  \u2013 especially neo-grotesks \u2013 are inherently bad. Those who are obsessed
  with this \u201CHelvetica fad\u201D are out of their minds.\r\n\r\nYour thoughts?"

    may have some DIN influence too in its upper-case, but not to the same extent;

  body: "\"How can that affect rendering?\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the fonts is
    around 3 times the resolution of the watch face, so the units per em of this font
    file would not likely effect rendering on this device. The reason 984 was chosen
    for this font is likely to be found in the combination of divisibility and file
    size reduction. \r\n\r\nIf this is a 1 x 1.25 inch device with a 384 dpi display,
    (which BTW, is 4.555 pixels per point), it's likely that a 984 unit font would
    work faster, and take up less space than a 2048 per em font, without any visual
    degradation. This would also save untold byte space in a font with an extensive
    glyph repertoire. \r\n\r\nIt is that extensive glyph repertoire, and previous
    hints of Apple not keeping much in residence on future devices, and knowing just
    how precious every single bit of space and processing power is in a wearable,
    that leads me to believe this font is going places. ;)\r\n\r\n"

    use 984 instead of 1000 after all. The savings (assuming compression, since otherwise
    anything from 513 to 1024 is the same) is very minimal, and sticking to 1000 (even
    with 2048 being an option) still has advantages in terms of robustness. In fact
    people have been reporting a bug related to deviating from 1000 UPM in OSX; it's
    ironic that Apple's own flagship typeface suffers from that.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>this

    on my own observations and experience since at least the early 80s:\r\n1: People
    without a single multi-cultural bone in their body shouldn't be trusted to deeply
    address multi-script type design. Compared to maybe a hundred people I know \u2013and
    yes, including myself\u2013 you really have little clue beyond Latin. And Apple
    has some holes in that respect as well \u2013 just look at the Armenian that comes
    with OSX!\r\n2: No matter how many devices this new San Francisco typeface gets
    shipped on, the logic pointing to its inadvisable proximity to its main competitor's
    core typeface would remain. It's simply not OK for somebody to look at an Apple
    Watch and think \u2013even for an instant\u2013 that Samsung made it. This situation
    was entirely avoidable, but I think Apple has become more imitative than many
    people realize.\r\n\r\nAs before, I think your recurring core problem here is
    that any hint of criticism of Apple (just a few months ago you were fervently
    defending Helvetica as a great choice for UI...) results in an arrogant lashing
    out, even to the point of ignoring the obvious. You give zero credit for anything
    to anybody who disagrees with you on anything, no matter how many years they're
    wrestled with something you've never thought cost-effective to bother with.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    off FF DIN, without even bothering to learn where that comes from.</cite>\r\n\r\nTo
    me, DIN means Deutsches Institut f\xFCr Normung; they specified a style of lettering
    for use in drafting. (The Russians tended to use this style of lettering as well;
    in the U.S., Keuffel & Esser's Leroy lettering guides were more influential -
    being a richer country, such luxuries were more affordable, and hand lettering
    was looked down on in drafting.) That it was FontFont that made a font called
    DIN based on this lettering style is, to me at least, secondary.\r\n\r\nWhile
    San Francisco isn't similar enough to DIN to be called a copy, it comes closer
    to DIN than it does to several of the other typefaces of which it has been accused
    of being a copy.\r\n\r\n@Nick Shinn:\r\n<cite>But there are typographic means
    other than the mid-century modern International Style, to present information
    on such devices.</cite>\r\n\r\nLooking at information presented on the high-resolution
    screen of my smartphone, I can well believe that it is not strictly necessary
    to use a sans-serif typeface in order to maintain the illusion of infinite-resolution
    print.\r\n\r\nFor branding reasons, though, no doubt designers at both Google
    and Apple want their devices to fairly shout <em>Modernity!</em>, and for that,
    a sans-serif face is more appropriate.\r\n\r\nAs to your illustration, however,
    the use of narrow italics, a change of font to upper-case/small capitals instead
    of boldface, a typeface with a small x-height, and oldstyle figures... represents
    a direction in which they will not go for <em>good</em> reason.\r\n\r\nIf they
    use a serif face, it would be something more like, say, Corona.\r\n\r\nAs to whether
    \"the vogue for sans serifs\" will \"last forever\" - well, literally, the Latin
    alphabet will not last forever. Sans-serif, though, is a simple option, whereas
    there are many different styles of serif. Bracketed serifs, the mainstay of serif
    type, are more likely to disappear from use than sans-serif.\r\n\r\nHowever, just
    as Bell Gothic was useful in letting I, 1, and l be distinguishable, a more reasonable
    alternative they might consider, if one needs a monoline face to disguise resolution
    limits, would be an Egyptian like Memphis or Stymie.\r\n\r\nAs for the Asianization
    of Latin script - San Francisco is not a typewriter-like monospace font, and so
    I don't immediately see how that could be a factor here, at least in a simple
    and direct manner."

    constantly. That same, loose-running IP says: \u201CThe Latin Script\u201D killed
    the world\u2019s other scripts, including his beloved auto body shop script.\r\n\r\nBut
    if you are concerned about UI font design and specification, as oppposed to the
    typical fear and anger of the future, do this simple math, you\u2019ll see neither
    of those are really true and/or unavoidable: The average Latin word is 5 glyphs,
    the average Latin glyph has 2 strokes (conservatively), for an average of 10 strokes
    per Latin word. The average Latin stroke in a Latin readability font is 1/10th
    of the em, and... the average Latin word has as much space horizontally, as it
    takes, to present that word. \r\n\r\nThe average Chinese glyph is two words and
    has as much space horizontally as all other Chinese glyphs. Two words with a conservative
    Latin stroke count, is already 20 Chinese glyph strokes (not at all uncommon among
    Chinese glyphs). If one is lucky ;) 1/2 half of those average average average
    Chinese glyph strokes are vertical and 1/2 horizontal. But if the Chinese design
    has the same weight as a readable Latin, the em is full of strokes in both directions,
    with 0 white space. Nothing is too important to leave out entirely, so something\u2019s
    got to give, and that is the ideal reading weight of the Latin. \r\n\r\nThis is
    all just rule of thumb, unless one has fonts fully dictionaried with a 1:1 contour
    to stroke ratio, and python, it\u2019s hard to be more precise, (and I have a
    lot of NDAs). But anyone with a brain can tell you for sure, even before seeing
    Chinese on the watch, Some of Apple\u2019s Latin system fonts are lighter than
    Latin\u2019s ideal weight. And this little talk is only about strokes and space,
    leaving out the other 6 parts of the universal mantra from nothing (space), to
    ideas (glyph or string of glyphs), which is also full of compromises by each script.
    \r\n\r\nIt is a very small world we are looking at here. So, no room yet for serifs,
    hinting, script wars, or complete residence, i.e. \u201Cthese fonts are going

    diversity, went and said:\r\n\r\n<cite>The Roman alphabet is not merely in possession,
    but it is in possession by right of conquest. The conquest was not made possible,
    or even expedited, by external authority; the victory of the Roman letter was
    due to its inherent flexibility and rationalism.</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, it's hard
    to argue that the Chinese or Japanese writing systems, never mind Akkadian cuneiform
    or Egyptian hieroglyphics, would be a better way to write.\r\n\r\nHowever, beyond
    that, it is hard to defend such a sentiment.\r\n\r\nIt's true that when it comes
    to mechanical simplicity of typesetting, the Latin alphabet has some advantages
    over the Ethiopic scripts, the Indic scripts (Devanagari, Thai, Burmese, Cambodian,
    Tibetan, and so on), the Korean script, or the Arabic script. However, the obstacles
    to handling these scripts on typewriters, let alone mechanical typesetters, were
    far from insuperable.\r\n\r\nAnd when it comes to Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Georgian,
    or Hebrew - there is no inherent superiority for the Latin script; for all practical
    purposes, there is an equivalency.\r\n\r\nWell, one could note the ink smudging
    problem with Hebrew's writing direction for right-handed writers, to say the equivalence
    isn't absolutely exact.\r\n\r\nOne can praise the victory of the ancient Phoenician
    writing system, having most of the scripts listed above as its descendants, excluding
    the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ones, without being too chauvinistic. Alphabets
    did help bring about mass literacy, and that was a good and progressive thing.\r\n\r\nI
    do agree that it's a problem when a people are hindered in carrying out the development
    of their script in a culturally authentic way. This is just one of the minor negative
    consequences of, say, the Turkish rule over Greece or the Russian rule over Eastern
    Armenia. To say nothing of the Turkish rule over Armenia.\r\n\r\nIt's up to the
    people of the languages involved to develop their scripts in an authentic way;
    no one else can do it for them. Latinization is a side effect of economic prosperity
    and a cosmopolitan youth culture; we've seen too much of cures far worse than
    this disease to prefer nativism and xenophobia.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that's
    what <em>you're</em> calling for, but some of us lack the imagination to see how
    else one would keep Korean or Japanese or X youth away from the corrupting influences
    of the Beatles or Elvis Presley or Britney Spears. Sure, especially with a language
    barrier, a vibrant local culture will mean local art - including typography -
    and music will find an audience, but often the most popular local artists will
    be those influenced by the global pop culture instead of indigenous traditions.\r\n\r\nThere
    are occasional rays of hope from that perspective, such as when a traditional
    Finnish folk song went viral on the Internet -\r\n\r\n[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rQKPijI]]\r\n\r\nbut
    the colossus that is Hollywood seems to trample all before it.\r\n\r\nWell, young
    people want to be cool and up-to-date, and the United States, for all its flaws,
    has a well-deserved reputation for largely respecting personal liberty.\r\n\r\nThe
    point I'm sort of dancing around here is this:\r\n\r\nWhen you present a problem,
    real though it may be, in such a way, that one possible response is -\r\n\r\nYes,
    I agree that X is a problem. <em>But what the heck do you want me to do about
    it?</em>\r\n\r\nthen, a lot of people, instead of replying that way, will just
    go a bit further... and essentially dismiss X as a problem. Basically because
    there are so many problems that one <em>can</em> do something about that one can't
    do enough about them all, what's the use of even putting X on the list of problems?\r\n\r\nSo
    in a case like that of Latinization, where no cure comes to mind that isn't \"worse
    than the disease\", it's really helpful to often include concrete recommendations
    for action to avoid getting dismissed."

    the Armenian script was invented!\r\n\r\nBTW Latinization is not \"inexplicable\".
    It's very easy to explain in the context of people from smaller cultures looking
    up to a \"victorious\" one. Aramian was working in Constantinople in an era of
    looking up to the West. Most type designers everywhere are looking to that same
    place.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>the letter <em>must not</em> look like L</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf
    you're speaking of the capital form, most people actually don't see an \"L\",
    because the slant is prominent. Actually the \xAB\u0540\xBB has exhibited great
    variety of form over the centuries... but none of them look like an \"R\" with
    the left stem removed... For the lc form, lazy/impressionable designers of course
    just copy-paste the \"h\".  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    you could. This is how the various system font replacements for Yosemite work.\r\n\r\nThe
    984 upm is not necessary. It\u2019s the upm value of the Yosemite Helvetica UI
    font. On Fira Sans I also set the upm to 984 without scaling the outlines, because
    then the x-height is very similar to the Helvetica UI fonts. I think Apple set
    the upm to this value (also without changing the outlines from ordinary Neue Helvetica)
    to make \u2018Helvetica Neue Desk UI\u2019 appear closer to Lucida Grande in size.\r\n\r\nThe
    original San Francisco has a upm value of 2048. The person who made the system

    not TTF. More reasons to always look at the source and not to rely on third-party

    is mainly known for a famous engraving of \"Mother Armenia\" from 1861. There
    aren't enough English search results on his name to see what he attempted to do
    to the Armenian script.\r\n\r\nBut using the Armenian spelling of his name, I
    found this page:\r\n\r\nhttp://books.tarumian.am/Meghapart/FACES/aramian.htm\r\n\r\nwhich
    has an illustration showing an \"h\" with a curly top for the letter in question,
    the other common change of \u057F into s (the capital form is like S), but as
    well, \u0580 becomes r, which is usually <em>not</em> found, even in the more
    heavily Latinized faces.\r\n\r\nAnd \u0581, of course, looks a lot like g even
    before Latinization - somewhat less so when the top part is a rectangle instead
    of an oval, as in the most traditional faces; similar for \u0566 and q.\r\n\r\nSo
    I take it Aramian originated the more Latinized style of Armenian typeface which
    rounded off corners, to use Latin rather than Boloragir as the model - and I suspect
    his main goal was simply to improve legibility. The Latin script has <strong>that</strong>
    characteristic in abundance, after all.\r\n\r\n(EDIT: From this discussion, I
    think I have gained some understanding of the issues with Armenian typography,
    at least as Hrant perceives them.\r\n\r\nBasically, the traditional metal Armenian
    typefaces, culturally sound though they may be, were in need of some \"fresh air\";
    Aramian provided that, but did so together with some gratuitous Latinization.\r\n\r\nThis
    is why it is felt that the current need is for typefaces for Armenian that are
    culturally authentic, but instead of following traditional models slavishly, still
    share some characteristics with the usual Latinized faces. Such typefaces exist,
    Hrant himself having designed some of them.\r\n\r\nAnd now I think I see where
    the remaining problem is. There are \"good\" Armenian fonts, but they're not getting
    used much by Armenians. One possible cause is that the free fonts with Armenian
    support tend to be either poor-quality metal type revivals using the old coding
    system, or heavily Latinized ones in Unicode.\r\n\r\nBut money is not likely to
    be the big issue. Personally, I <em>had</em> found it to be an annoyance that
    the metal revivals weren't available in Unicode.\r\n\r\nInstead the issue is basically
    this:\r\n\r\nThe Armenian community is divided into the diaspora, speaking Western
    Armenian, and the homeland, speaking Eastern Armenian. The diaspora uses the traditional
    orthography, the homeland is content with the changes wrought by a Soviet-era
    spelling reform.\r\n\r\nToday, the homeland is under one of those corrupt regimes
    like the one Putin is invading the Ukraine to avenge. So the political winds aren't
    driving the homeland and the diaspora together. The diaspora likes its metal revivals,
    the homeland sees nothing out of place with overly-Latinized faces. And they can't
    read what each other writes well anyways.\r\n\r\nWell, who knows what the future
    may bring. In five years, perhaps the Russian people will tire of isolation, and
    Armenia will open to the West. Maybe people making fonts for Google or Linux or
    even Microsoft will see the light about Armenian and tone down the Latinization.
    But direct progress in the Armenian community itself seems for a later day.)"

    As you've pointed out before, Armenia itself is an excellent example of that,
    as in the homeland, strongly Latinized faces are generally used because that's
    what people are used to from the Soviet years - classic Armenian faces, which
    you also find problematic, are mainly used in the diaspora, although I think the
    Latinized ones are making inroads there too, since that's what you get from Microsoft.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I think that if Thais or Koreans or Greeks want to play around with features from
    other cultures and script systems, that's fine, as an outsider, if I were running
    a computer or smartphone company, I would definitely want to tread carefully in
    having default fonts for text use prepared for markets with other script systems.\r\n\r\nI
    would think, as a matter of course, that it was possible that a typeface for a

    for Korean - while Chinese characters are still used in South Korea as part of
    the writing system (called \"hanja\"), they're not used <em>much</em>. The writing

    ordinary type designers exaggerating it because it looks cool.\r\n\r\nThe stroke
    contrasts in typical Roman faces, I think, do serve a purpose, and shouldn't be
    deliberately suppressed at least in lighter weights. But as has been noted in
    discussions of Bible typefaces, Clarendons with low stroke contrast have been
    used in situations where the highest legibility is required.\r\n\r\nAnd the exaggerated
    stroke contrast of the Didones is generally <em>not</em> considered all that good
    a thing, at least for text faces.\r\n\r\nSince readabillity, as opposed to legibility,
    is harder to quantify, and less work has been done on measuring it (although,
    as a discussion here noted, Legros et. al. noted one tool, blink tests, that can
    be used for it) while there are obvious ways to modify the Latin alphabet to make
    it more <em>legible</em> (i.e. increase the x-height to a grotesque level), how
    to change it from what people are used to in order to make it more <em>readable</em>

      It depends on what kind of Chinese text you're considering.\r\n\r\n<em>Baihua</em>
      texts are fundamentally a transcription of spoken Chinese, in which most words
      are two syllables long. Each character represents a syllable, so those words
      will take two syllables.\r\n\r\n<em>Wenli</em> texts are in \"classical style\";
      here, usually one character represents a word - corresponding to the first syllable,
      in the case of a two-syllable word. Ambiguity is avoided because there are multiple
      different characters for syllables with the same sound and tone, with the meaning
      partly indicated by the \"radical\" (more accurately, the Chinese word means
      \"classifier\").\r\n\r\nAlso, a Chinese word generally does not contain as much
      meaning as two English words. Chinese does not have word prefixes or suffixes,
      so their functions are generally performed by additional words. Thus, in English,
      one says \"five books\", in Chinese one says \"five piece book\".\r\n\r\nThis
      is <em>still</em> highly oversimplified. I don't speak Chinese, nor am I a Sinologist,
      I've just read introductions to Chinese linguistics for laypersons out of interest."

    the invention of the alphabet, because it led to universal literacy, and character-based
    scripts like that of Chinese have objectively lagged seriously behind in this
    regard. (Although I've noted that speakers of English are the last ones who should
    be criticizing Chinese - our spelling is also a major obstacle to effective writing
    literacy, just as finding the right phonetic is with Chinese characters. <em>Reading</em>
    literacy isn't as hard as Westerners fear in Chinese, as a repertoire of a few
    hundred character components can give that.)\r\n\r\nMorison did, however, name
    the Latin alphabet specifically. It is more legible than Hebrew or Arabic, and
    it's simpler to write than Thai or Glagolitic.\r\n\r\nBut has what Morison said
    been misinterpreted by placing it in the context of Hrant's concerns about the
    typography of other script systems being usurped, contaminated, or whatever by
    the typography of the Latin script?\r\n\r\nWell, given that Morison's words were
    in the introduction to \"The New Hebrew Typography\", a book by Hugh Schoenfeld,
    in which a reform of the Hebrew Script which amounted to Latinizing it quite thoroughly
    was proposed, it's hard for me to accuse Hrant of taking them badly out of context.
    He really does seem to be praising more about the Latin alphabet than what it
    shares with ancient Phoenician.\r\n\r\nI've had the opportunity to read that book
    now, however. I see that Hugh Schoenfeld's motivations were honorable, and he
    made an effort to justify each of his letter shapes from an authentic Hebrew source.\r\n\r\nIt's
    true that his example of a newspaper page in the Hebrew script is sad-looking
    from a typographical standpoint to eyes accustomed to what the Latin script can
    do - it reminds me of Chinese-language newspaper pages. But neither China nor
    Israel have been prevented from entering the modern age from shortcomings in their
    typography that <em>are</em> merely aesthetic, for all of Morison's denials of
    this.\r\n\r\nAnd Chinese-language and Hebrew-language glossy magazines, as well,
    show that those scripts are not so badly hindered in this respect. Yes, they lack
    a lower-case with ascenders and descenders, which is advantageous for legibility...
    in the case of Hebrew, the ancient Phoenician script is an alternative that would
    remedy that, but for religious reasons, it is proscribed from use for the Tanakh
    (the Old Testament) - and during the long years of diaspora, the Hebrew language
    was often used for little else but for religous purposes, so the old alphabet
    fell into disuse."

    <em>one</em> way to look at it.\r\n\r\nBack in the old days, before cultural relativism
    and political correctness, people may just have assumed that the Latin script
    went through a more complete process of \"evolution\" than the Hebrew script,
    and thus that some of the things that happened to Latin on its journey from Phoenician
    were yet to happen to Hebrew.\r\n\r\nI'm not ashamed to say that I think the upper
    and lower case of the Latin script (or Cyrillic or Armenian) are better integrated
    than those of the Greek script, so I don't completely reject the notion of objective
    merit as applied to writing systems.\r\n\r\nIt did seem odd to me that Schoenfeld
    seemed to think that the Hebrew script had to be just about exactly like the Latin
    script for the Hebrew language to compete equally in the modern world. From a
    modern perspective, one tends to ask \"Why?\". But at the time that book was written,
    non-Western scripts were still poorly served by typefounders.\r\n\r\nToday, with
    laser printers and scads of TrueType fonts, we see abundant evidence that the
    typographical possibilities of Chinese and Korean, for example, are as abundant
    and rich as those of the Latin script... <em>even if</em> that is often due to
    typefaces which have borrowed heavily from Roman alphabet typefaces to the point
    of cultural inauthenticity. While there's a danger of homogenization, this is
    in part a result of just getting started.\r\n\r\nBack in the 1930s, though, in
    the days of hot metal, and with limited economic resources to boot, the typical
    Chinese-language newspaper or magazine looked pretty uninspiring typographically.
    In fact, that was true in the 1960s as well.\r\n\r\nThe example of a Hebrew newspaper
    page showed that this was true at the time of Hebrew typography as well.\r\n\r\nConcluding
    that this was due to a defect in the script itself, rather than a difference in
    the script's economic position, was a mistake <em>as we know today</em>. But hindsight
    is 20/20, as they say.\r\n\r\nSo while I agree that Schoenfeld was badly mistaken,
    rather than viewing him as suffering from some sort of self-abnegation or cringing
    subservience to European culture, I am much more inclined to see him as having
    made an honest mistake."

    of his day to the wrong cause. Or it may just have been that the economic factors
    weren't something that could be changed, whereas, at least in theory, the script
    system could be changed.\r\n\r\nThe book did bill itself as being \"for a future
    generation\"; submitting an idea for consideration, even if it has negatives as
    well as positives, is not itself a harmful act.\r\n\r\nAlso, the book first appeared
    in 1932. Thus, his thinking could also have been influenced by the idea that if
    texts in Hebrew - or Yiddish - were less foreign-looking, this might, in some
    slight way, contribute to reducing the suspicion and fear with which some people
    regarded Jews.\r\n\r\nOf course, my emotional view of his work is very different

    it comes to factoring in technological shifts, such as the invention of printing.\r\n\r\nBTW
    all this has an interesting consequence: writing systems can keep improving, to
    me even consciously.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>But at the time that book was written,
    non-Western scripts were still poorly served by typefounders.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn
    fact that's a valid sentiment that Schonfield explicitly stated in his book. He
    saw the pronounced skewing of Hebrew towards Latin as a way to quickly/cheaply
    produce a large number of new Hebrew fonts by directly mining the cornucopia of
    Latin designs. But to me that's a poor excuse for running roughshod over cultural
    tradition, not to mention readability. Progress is something I admire, but throwing
    out the baby with the bathwater not so much.\r\n\r\nWas Schonfield simply being
    naive? We'll never know, but typically Latinization does involve some degree of
    envy (which is not a virtue).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Just looking at this thread for the first time. \r\n\r\nNot on the main subject
    of discussion, but on Hebrew, it does have one ascender (lamed) one letter that
    descends more (kof) and one that often does (ayin), and four descender variants
    used for final letters. So it does have some similarity to the latin lower case
    in this respect. \r\n\r\nThe ancient paleo-Hebrew (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Hebrew_alphabet)
    was not used after the exile in Babylonia, when the Aramaic 'square script', the
    current pen-based script was adopted from Babylonia. I'm guessing that's because
    the old script was scratching mono-lines on clay or stone, and the technology
    had changed to pens and other substrata, like parchment. The old script was not
    forgotten, but not used except for to give an antique effect, like on coins. There
    were another 500+ years before the exile done by Rome, which is usually counted
    as 'diaspora.'\r\n\r\nAnd yes, most but not all modern Chinese words are two syllable,
    like the name for China, Zhongguo. But what is a 'word' is not as clear as in
    Western languages. Individual characters also have meaning, e.g. zhong = middle;
    guo = kingdom or country. A character\u2014which is always one syllable\u2014can
    be a word on its own, or can be part of a series of two or more characters that
    are used with one referent, like Zhongguo, China. There is no conjugation, grammatical
    modification of words, so 'word' is not otherwise marked off grammatically, I
    believe. Also visually, each character is in its own square, with no extra space
    between a series of characters that make up one word and adjacent words. \r\n"

    the high resolution of the screen being used, designing a special font for higher

    a font with vertical lines like DIN for such a purpose only makes sense if it's
    bitmapped. If it's instead a vector font that will be used in many different sizes,
    often the verticals will go down the middle of a pixel (absent <em>hinting</em>)
    and that would not produce an ideal result.\r\n\r\nHowever, of course hinting
    <em>is</em> provided with the common vector font formats. And the font is also
    being chiefly used by the operating system in a standard size. So they could design
    a vector font around the grid of its most common display size, and rely on hinting
    to make the results reasonable when it is occasionally used at other sizes.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think that using Garamond, like the example provided earlier in this thread,

    of the 60's, 70's and 80's, and their font choices.</cite>\r\n\r\nI think that
    <em>most</em> of the people throwing bricks at Helvetica today realize, and acknowledge,
    that Helvetica was a good, even revolutionary, typeface at the time of its initial
    introduction and greatest popularity.\r\n\r\nThey're criticizing it for the same
    reason as they criticize Times Roman, or even Papyrus. It is a good typeface,
    but it is overused, and it's time to move on to other choices for the sake of
    being original.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't know that I agree with this viewpoint.
    I think that the best reason for a new typeface is to fill a need better - however
    slightly - than it is filled by existing typefaces. Of course, as an artistic
    endeavour, typography and type design are also subject to changing fashions. Thus,
    the type designer has to avoid what seems hopelessly dated.\r\n\r\nCheltenham
    is dated. Neither Helvetica nor Times Roman appear dated to most of the general
    public. Today's currently popular faces, like Stone Sans or like FF Olsen, may
    well end up looking dated in another 20 years from now.\r\n\r\nSo I view the greatest
    typographical accomplishment as taking the existing stock of timeless typefaces
    - like, say, Garamond, Baskerville, Bodoni - and adding to that stock with Goudy
    Old Style, Futura, Times Roman, and Helvetica among others.\r\n\r\nIf, through
    study of Baskerville, Century Expanded, and Corona, someone can come closer to
    the Platonic ideal of a generic invisible text typeface, I will applaud. If they
    keep type designers employed through a strategem analogous to moving the hemline
    up and down, I will not be particularly interested - and <em>yet</em>, out of
    the turbulent search for new display typefaces, out of the pursuit of novelty,
    things do come that were valid.\r\n\r\nTimes Roman, after all, definitely <em>was</em>
    novel in its day; it still looked fresh and new in the 1960s, compared to Baskerville,
    Caledonia, Century Expanded, or even faces like Corona, Aurora, or Textype, which
    were highly legible, reasonably readable, and pretty much invisible.\r\n\r\nTimes
    Roman was distinctive enough that it, therefore, <em>failed</em> the \"crystal
    goblet\" test. And yet, in my opinion, its merit is enough to make it the next
    Caslon - that is, I think that typographers can look forward to it being \"overused\"
    for another hundred years or more.\r\n\r\nBut my extreme partiality for typographic
    conservatism notwithstanding, cycles and revivals have had a big part in the history
    of typefaces. So if Helvetica falls out of fashion, among the available options
    will be revivals of Venus and News Gothic. They will look fresh against a backdrop
    of Helvetica, and Helvetica will look fresh against them as a backdrop. There'll
    probably be room for Futura in there somewhere - as well as for new contemporary
    designs, <em>and</em> for Akzidenz Grotesk as well."

    the high resolution and choice of font. Actually, the font (\"San Francisco\")
    is a new creation by Apple. It looks custom-made for at-a-glance readability.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2015/04/08/baig-buying-the-apple-watch/25436885/\r\n\r\nhttp://recode.net/2015/04/08/a-week-on-the-wrist-the-apple-watch-review/\r\n\r\nhttp://mashable.com/2015/04/08/apple-watch-review/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/technology/personaltech/dear-diary-my-week-wearing-an-apple-watch.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-04-08/apple-watch-review-you-ll-want-one-but-you-don-t-need-one"

    would. It's not like I'm exercising all day or running from meeting to meeting
    or getting constant texts. Plus my traditional watches have sentimental value
    (like one was my father's). \r\n\r\nSo I'll wait a while. Maybe version 2 or 3."

  body: The comment quoted from the Mashable review seems to indicate that the San
    Francisco typeface was indeed very much a success at fulfilling the purpose for
    which it was intended.

  body: "The fact that Apple decides to charge an extra $200 or so for letting you
    have the watch in stainless steel instead of aluminum, is sufficient to feel that
    very little depth in reviews of the watch was really required.\r\n\r\nHowever
    well-made and engineered it might be, if the company sees its mission as taking
    consumers for what the market will bear, and presumably later on, in line with
    their previous practice, using well-crafted patents to hobble its competition
    from doing obvious things that the technology wasn't ready for doing at a reasonable
    price for them to do those things before Apple, I find it of little interest."

  body: It may have mentioned the typeface, but it was a nearly incomprehensible stream-of-consciousness
    piece. I expected the serial killer quote to connect to some contrast in a subsequent
    remark, but that didn't happen. And homeless people do need to know what time
    it is, so they can get to the soup kitchen on time.

    I see that you will be going to ISType this year. It's a great little conference
    (in an amazing city) that I had the privilege of being invited to in 2012*. While
    you're there you might consider striking up a conversation with Gerry, Lara and
    Azza about Latinization.\r\n\r\n* https://vimeo.com/56419418\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
