    the idea is being floated in some circles to make the Icelandic kronur the Universal
    Internet Currency, which makes sense because Iceland has an incredibly awesome
    internet infrastructure, and blazing fast access speeds.\r\n\r\nPlus, through
    a proposed \"pay-ahead\" subscription plan, currency conversion charges would
    be minimal\u2014typically, 1%. Which is to say: if you anticipate your internet
    purchases and pony up the money first to draw against later, in essence you have
    a virtual ATM card and, therefore, lower transaction fees overall. \r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    websafe (at bookmark size and up) ought to be a consideration, too."

  body: "Frode, I only had one sketch. And I actually wasn't trying to make it look
    like a rune. But I don't mind if it does - in fact I tend to like that idea. Westerners
    tend to brandish the term \"racism\" way too enthusiastically - I see that in
    the US daily. Something obvious might be boring (and I personally wouldn't want
    a currency to ignite passions anyway*) but that does not equate to insult. Runes
    aren't something to be embarrassed about.\r\n\r\n* For example the old Dutch notes
    were beautiful. But is the idea of currency beautiful? For one thing it was invented
    (in Smyrna) purely as a way to reduce bartering and facilitate taxation.\r\n\r\nRiccardo,
    agreed. Except for sets of countries that actually want their currencies to share
    a symbol, each one should be different. BTW when I said that the \"K\" isn't there
    enough it's because when I look at it I see the \"R\" first, which is a problem
    (but maybe mine has the same problem).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
