		<div class="commentbody"><p>Very promising!</p>
<p>Just looking at the upper case now, I notice that the curve at the bottom of the B has a smaller radius than the others in the B. It might look better matching. Does the E need to be a hair narrower? The crossbar on the F slightly shorter? The bottom serifs on the C, J look a bit fat; they might be better matching the weight of the ELZ bottom spikes. Is the J a little too wide?</p>
<p>This is well on its way to being a very nice and useful display face.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is a very interesting hybrid design - I&rsquo;m seeing Didone, Eastern Europe, the RdR (love the nick on the &ldquo;el&rdquo;) and Fenice. The &ldquo;a&rdquo; is a brave attempt, but the beak and the tail are fighting; that would give it a cool PoMo flavor, but no other glyph has such an attribute&hellip; I&rsquo;d look at ITC Veljovic* and Sylfaen** for ideas on the &ldquo;a&rdquo;. Or maybe remove the beak entirely - yeah, I think that would pump up the elegance even more; although I might still make the tail a wedge.</p>

<li>
<p>Narrower J</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>a/d: I&rsquo;d go for the slightly upslanted tail (the second one). But if you go for the totally flat one on the &ldquo;d&rdquo;, make the one on the &ldquo;a&rdquo; identical, not a wedge. And I assume the &ldquo;u&rdquo; will follow suit.</p>
<p>s: I&rsquo;m in love.</p>
<p>E/F: Are you going for an apparent alignment of the bars? If so, the one on the &ldquo;F&rdquo; looks slightly lower. Personally I might &ldquo;break&rdquo; it and make the bar of the &ldquo;F&rdquo; noticeably lower (and probably a bit [more] shorter too).</p>
<p>Flourished K/R: not working for me (especially the &ldquo;K&rdquo;). The &ldquo;J&rdquo; and single-flourish &ldquo;N&rdquo; seem passable, but only the double-flourish &ldquo;N&rdquo; is really singing I think. On the &ldquo;K&rdquo; and &ldquo;R&rdquo; maybe try loosening things up.</p>
<p>2/3: charming. A bit too much tail on the &ldquo;2&rdquo; though.</p>
<p>y: seems to be working, but let&rsquo;s see it in &ldquo;wyvern&rdquo;.</p>
<p>k: the narrow one seems better.</p>
<p>Q: start the tail from the inside; maybe try splicing in one of those long serifs, like from the &ldquo;J&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Just noticed something bad in the &ldquo;r&rdquo;: don&rsquo;t thicken the arch at the beak - make it like the &ldquo;a&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the oval period.</p>
<p>BTW the texture is very nice - just make the blank space smaller.</p>

<p>I think the bottom of the d looks best with the flat serif as it matchs the top of the ascender. And then the tail of the a would best match the d, as Hrant wrote.</p>
<p>To me the spur on the l is needlessly distracting. I think it might hurt the reception of an otherwise useful display face.</p>
<p>The r isn&rsquo;t working. Normally the join with the stem is lower on the r than the m and n, and the same weight at the junction. Here the high and heavy join is disharmonious. I don&rsquo;t know about the beak on the r, but I think the connection needs to be fixed first.</p>
<p>The g is going to be a challenge&ndash;maybe a one story will be the way out.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The spike on the &ldquo;el&rdquo; is a mark of royalty (it was partly a -failed- copy protection scheme restricted to fonts produced under Louis XIV). Admittedly such historical sensitivity is essentially moot, and a good functional reason to have the spike (to disambiguate with the UC &ldquo;I&rdquo; in designs with double-serif tops on the ascenders, as in the RdR) is absent here*. But the spike is still: elegant; distinctive; and a great talking point, as Spiekermann has observed concerning the &ldquo;g&rdquo; in Meta. This sort of thing is pure gold in a display face - and it&rsquo;s not like we have a shortage of conventional Didones out there&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Although that didn&rsquo;t stop the Imprimerie Nationale from putting it in anyway:
<img src="/images/old-images/CharlesX_3978.gif" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p>BTW, concerning the &ldquo;el&rdquo; spike I saw something pretty shocking recently: it was actually present in some <cite>manuscript</cite> documents, from way before the RdR, possibly even before the invention of printing (in Europe). I have no idea why.</p>
<p>I do have an idea about the &ldquo;y&rdquo; though: try a form that&rsquo;s a &ldquo;v&rdquo; with a descender going straight down (and curling) - like a &ldquo;j&rdquo;. They used to do that back when, and not only does it looks classy and rarified but it helps spacing too.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;g&rdquo;: especially if you keep the &ldquo;u&rdquo;-based &ldquo;y&rdquo; it might be smart to have a monocular form, but not making a binocular &ldquo;g&rdquo; also seems like a lost opportunity, even a cop-out. I would look to the funky &ldquo;g&quot;s in the old Didot fonts, like the ones JFP has revived.</p>

<p>I just love the l-spike. I know that it isn&rsquo;t necessarily appropriate, but this is a remix of styles anyway, and maybe it&rsquo;ll be able to add something. In the font&rsquo;s newest version, I have two l-glyphs… a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; l and the spike l.</p>
<p>This version has a draft at a complete lowercase. There are currently two g glyph test: a single and double-storey g.</p>
<p>Hrant, my first go at a lowercase y was a v with a tail, just like you recommend. It didn&rsquo;t work. But I will try again anyway.</p>
<p>The period is now round.</p>
<p>Bill: there the lowercase r is new in this version.</p>
<p>Lari: <em>I don’t like the lowered diaresis.</em>
Don&rsquo;t worry. It will just be an alternate in the end. Otherwise, it wouldn&rsquo;t match all the other diacritics. But old German metal type almost always had cap umlauts differently than the dieresis is now positioned. This alternate lowered version will have uses.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice improvements, like in the r. (Could it be just a bit narrower?) I do think your single story g works better with this design. To me the only thing that doesn&rsquo;t work is the y. With the j and the g the same, particularly, it doesn&rsquo;t look &lsquo;y&rsquo; enough. Does a diagonal version with a horizontal serif at the bottom not work? I don&rsquo;t have any bright ideas if that doesn&rsquo;t work, but to me its the only bit that doesn&rsquo;t work. Everything else works, though I think further tweaking can make it smoother.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The binocular &ldquo;g&rdquo; is completely out of character; it&rsquo;s from a different century and a different continent. But I still think you can make a fitting one. The monocular &ldquo;g&rdquo; is balanced and stylistically harmonious, but it&rsquo;s a missed opportunity. One place to start looking for a good binocular &ldquo;g&rdquo; is the &ldquo;a&rdquo;; another is the &ldquo;s&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Seeing the conventional &ldquo;el&rdquo;, I can think of another reason to keep the spiked one: the &ldquo;el&rdquo; is the poorest letter of the Latin alphabet, needing by far the most help in contributing something useful and memorable to text.</p>
<p>I agree with William that the &ldquo;r&rdquo; should be narrower.</p>
<p>More on lc:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d make the eye of the &ldquo;e&rdquo; smaller.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;f&rdquo; is not very attractive, but maybe a good form in context.</li>
<li>Why not make the left foot serif of the &ldquo;k&rdquo; double-sided?</li>
<li>In the &ldquo;k&rdquo;, the join is looking neither here not there: there&rsquo;s too much going on for this type of design. I might make the top arm continue to the stem, and have the leg come out of it, or come out of the join, one or the other, clearly.</li>
<li>The bar of the &ldquo;t&rdquo; could be shorter on the right.</li>
<li>In the &ldquo;x&rdquo;, the thin arms are flared differently to distraction.</li>
<li>There seem to be some funny decisions about foot serif lengths: a longer right side makes sense in the &ldquo;f&rdquo; and &ldquo;r&rdquo;, but it clearly doesn&rsquo;t in the &ldquo;el&rdquo;, and in this design probably not the &ldquo;p&rdquo; and [left side of] the &ldquo;q&rdquo; either. In this last pair if you do keep one side longer, I&rsquo;d make the left head serif of the &ldquo;d&rdquo; longer as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>More on UC:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vertical stem in the &ldquo;G&rdquo; should be taller, possibly even reaching the bars of the &ldquo;E&rdquo;/&ldquo;F&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;T&rdquo; should be wider.</li>
<li>In terms of cap widths, there&rsquo;s something unsettling about the decisions of what to make narrow and what to make wide; I can&rsquo;t entirely put my finger on it, but for example looking at the sequence &ldquo;HAMB&rdquo; I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of confusion.</li>
