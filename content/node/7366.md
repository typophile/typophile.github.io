  body: It appears to be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/FontForums/read.php?f=5&amp;i=45707&amp;t=45707">Novel
    Gothic</a>, though I don&#39;t know of a digital version with that name. I do
    remember coming across an apparent clone called <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=pythagoras+fonts">Pythagoras</a>
    that has made it into the free font archives.

  body: The Font Company offered Novel Gothic by that name, but I don&#39;t know of
    a source anymore since Precision Type bit the typographical dust. <BR> <BR>Other
    versions include <a href="http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm" target="_blank"> Nimrod</a>
    and <a href="http://www.qbf.de/tceng.htm" target="_blank"> Napoli</a> &#40;7 weights&#41;,
    both from the Quick Brown Fox &#40;Brendel Informatik&#41; site.
