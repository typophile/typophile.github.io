  understand it to be be similar to Century.  I've not heard of it before, and was
  wondering if anyone has any info on it.  Who drew/cut it?  Is there a digital version?
  Google searches have yielded little, and I cannot get the Typophile searches to
  work.  Any info would be appreciated."

  body: Excellent, Thank you.  I like how Primer is a little lighter than Century.
    I do lament that there does not seem to be a faithful digital version. Again thanks
