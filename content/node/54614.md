  along the lines of TNR, but maybe not so tired.\r\n\r\nCould you point me to some
  alternatives?"

    go with Quadriga or Karmina, or use my alltime favorite Aldine 721 (Bitstream's
    version of Plantin). All to see at MyFonts.

    everyone at Fontshop knows that Erik Spiekermann wrote this about Times and Concorde:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"A
    TYPE DESIGNER\u2019S CHOICES: Ever wonder if type designers play favorites? I
    posed the question to Erik Spiekermann. His selections and comments follow: ...
    3. CONCORDE \u201CThe first typeface whose design process I followed. This was
    Berthold\u2019s answer to Times New Roman, and I think it is a much better design.\u201D
    ...\"</cite> (Full article here http://www.stepinsidedesign.com/STEPMagazine/Article/28761)\r\n\r\nSo,
    it is ridiculous that Fontshop does not mention Concorde it its own \"Times alternatives\"
    list and does not disclose that the man who started Fontshop thinks that Concorde
    is a better choice than Times."

    \"Times aesthetic\".\r\nBut given that Times is a staple of default systems design,
    and that your reading of its connotations is valid, how has it acquired overtones
    of amateurism and the vernacular, while Helvetica, has not? \r\nPerhaps it is
    because Arial is the \"bad twin\" which assumes that role.\r\nSo is what's happening
    here a movement to make Times the bad twin of Concorde?\r\nThat doesn't make sense,
    as Times is the original, definitive version, and IMO a livelier face than Concorde."

  body: "> Times is the original, definitive version\r\n\r\nThe problem is that what
    is used today as Times New Roman (TIMES.TTF) is not the same as what was used
    originally. The original Times was a hotmetal composition font which was available
    in different versions for different point sizes. On the other hand, Concorde was
    designed as a photocomposition font with only one (Diatype etc.) version for all
    point sizes. Therefore, Lange opened the counters of Concorde Bold, so that the
    font could also be used in small point sizes. See e.g.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/counter-e.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/counter-o.jpg\r\n\r\n(The
    black contour is Times New Roman, the red contour is Concorde. The glyphs were
    scaled to the same x-height.)\r\n\r\nTimes New Roman Bold (TIMESBD.TTF) is badly
    suited for very small point sizes, and therefore many dictionary publishing houses
    in Germany, which formerly used Times Bold for headwords, switched to sanserif
    fonts for headwords, with Times Regular (= non-bold Times) still used, but only
    for the text following the headwords."

    I don't understand the reasoning behind wanting the common and vernacular, but
    not wanting the tired. When it comes to type, they are one and the same thing.
    I can't think of any common and vernacular fonts that aren't \"tired\". Perhaps
    some of ITC's 70s and 80s stuff? (But I think a lot of them should be re-tired...)\r\n"

  body: "A very valid alternative to Times New Roman might be the freshly released
    <strong>[[http://www.paratype.com/public/|PT Serif]]</strong>. It is as well,
    like Times, a slightly condensed serif font with relatively large x-height. It
    does not suffer from the strong contrasts of TNR in body text use, which makes
    it more easier on the eye in my opinion. Since it is for free and is similar in
    look and feel on a page, it should be an accessible alternative. Plus it has a
    cyrillic alphabet included too. \r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/public/><img
