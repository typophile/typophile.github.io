  asked by a client to work from it.  I have only bitmap copies of this and no idea
  what the font is... if someone could assist me by identifying it I'd be incredibly
  grateful, I've been searching for hours now and getting nowhere.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nSimon."

  body: You may be searching forever because there are literally thousands of these
    sloppy handwriting fonts. Is there no opportunity to substitute <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/genres/handwriting_fonts_legible_print/">a
    better typeface</a>?

  body: "As I feared.  Alas there is no opportunity to replace this and there is no
    way of contacting the original designer so I'm a bit stuck.  I'll return to the
    client and just state that I'm going to have to work with different fonts and
    styles for the website design on this one, they'll have to keep the printed materials'
    fonts as they are.\r\n\r\nThanks anyway :)"
