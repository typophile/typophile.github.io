  I'm travelling to New York City in mid-August and I was wondering if any of you
  know any good/interesting/educational typographic-related museums/locations/companies
  etc around that time. 18-26 of August to be more precise.\r\n\r\nThank you."

    will be closed during August.\r\n\r\nBut there is also the New York <a href=\"http://www.centerforbookarts.org/\">Center
    for Book Arts</a>.\r\n\r\nBoth the <a href=\"http://www.aigany.org/\">AIGA</a>
    and the <a href=\"http://www.adcglobal.org/\">Art Directors Club</a> usually have
    some type of exhibit on their premises.\r\n\r\nDon't miss this great exhibition
    of three (yes, three) Gutenberg bibles at the <a href=\"http://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/exhibition.asp?id=7\">The
    Morgan Library & Museum</a>.\r\n\r\nThere is also the [[Herb Lubalin Study Center
    of Design and Typography]], located within Cooper Union. It's by appointment only,
    and they have a limited schedule during the summer, but it is <a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/004949.html\">worth
    it</a>!"
