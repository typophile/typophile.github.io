  metallic gold lettering on Plike, a luxurious black paper.\r\n\r\nI have a big site
  update planned in the next month at \r\nwww.seblester.co.uk, with lots of new work,
  but wanted \r\nto give Typophiles a preview of this piece.\r\n\r\nPlease contact
  me via my site for pricing and availability.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mightier_3676.jpg]"

    it a one-off piece of art?\r\n\r\nPretty tasty BTW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "Hi Nick. No typefaces here. Just a one-off print.\r\nI think they could probably
    all work well as fonts, \r\nbut too much other stuff to do at the moment.\r\nI'm
    sure you know the feeling!"
