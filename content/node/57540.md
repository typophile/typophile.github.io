  through <em>MyFonts.</em>\r\nI have a lot of doubts and I hope you can help me with
  some of these points:\r\nWhich points should I consider to start writing an EULA?\r\nI
  know an <em>EULA</em> is the way the foundry conceive the permission to use its
  fonts and I just want to protect my work as much as possible from piracy.\r\nCan
  I submit an EULA, for example, to distribute my typefaces via <em>MyFonts</em> and
  update it after a while?\r\nWhat's the difference between selling fonts to 1-5 cpus
  or individually? I just want to know some advantages and disadvantages of these
  options.\r\nDoes it make any sense to prohibit copying font files to a store device
  or sending them by email?\r\nIs it convenient to allow font embeding for websites?\r\nHow
  can I protect my typefaces from piracy if I allow font embeding for websites?\r\nThanks
  in advance and sorry for my english."

    EULA has pretty much nothing to do with preventing 'piracy'. Those folks really
    don't care what's in the EULA.\r\n\r\nThe EULA is an agreement between you and
    your paying customers."

  body: "The EULA is a license agreement, you make the rules for this license. You
    can make it as complex or simple as you like, as long as it's fair for both parties.
    \r\nSelling fonts for 1-5 cpus, is that you can install it on 5 cpus, so 5 people
    can use the font at ones. Individually; only one person can use it on one cpu.
    Fonts for 1 cpu (1 person) are mostly cheaper than for 1-5 cpus.\r\n\r\n<cite>Does
    it make any sense to prohibit copying font files to a store device or sending
    them by email?</cite>\r\n\r\nTransactions will go slower if you only prohibit
    sending the fonts by email.\r\n\r\nPreventing piracy is very difficult, you can
    better make a good EULA, after that you can always take legal steps if you find
    someone is abusing your work.\r\n\r\nRudy"

  body: "I agree with both.\r\n\r\n- Most people who license your fonts, even single
    work-at-home freelancers have more than one computer. It really is more user-friendly
    to at least allow for 5 computers. \r\n- Web embedding is the new frontier. I
    think foundries should allow for embedding in Flash (SIFR) but understand if they
    don't want to allow for @Font-Face because it is not protected.\r\n- Consider
    allowing for PDF Print & Preview embedding as well as, and at least, distribution
    to clients and press houses.\r\n\r\nHere is <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/28852\">another
    useful thread</a> about EULAs here on Typophile."

  body: "Just to throw out some things to think about if you're going the EULA route...\r\n\r\nAs
    a designer, I'd love it if you licensed the font per users, rather than per CPU.
    I'm one user, but I own 2 computers and use them both. I'd love a license that
    allowed me to use the purchased font on computers I own.\r\n\r\nSo, one way to
    think about it might be a user license vs. small studio license vs. corporate
    license. "

    with this permission but to store a font in a server is very risky, I found an
