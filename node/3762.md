    but I don&#39;t think it translates like that...

    &amp; Morgan that sells marbled and other hand-made papers. In a discussion about
    reproducing one his marbled papers the owner cautioned me that all the papers
    he sells are under copyright, owned by the individual makers.'

  body: And those paper makers will come after you too!. Years ago I used a piece
    of marble paper as a background for a cover design on a library magazine. I didn&#39;t
    realize the design of the marble paper was copyright protected. The artist contacted
    the magazine and we payed the artist for the usage. <BR> <BR>Isn&#39;t it amazing
    that a piece of marble paper can be protected by copyright in the U.S., but a
    typeface design cannot. A typeface is too utilitarian, but marble paper not so.

    Design of Books</a> refers to endpapers. When the book is laid flat, the papers
    frame the page spread. They&#39;re a wonderful design element when chosen carefully.

  body: '&#62;the design of the marble paper was copyright protected <BR> <BR>I can
    understand that, because each piece of marbled paper is unique, and as such more
    art than design. <BR> <BR>So, while one may not be able to copyright a typeface
    when it is considered as a vectored design, if an original piece of &#34;real&#34;
    artwork &#40;ie one-off ink on paper drawing&#41; exists of the individual characters,
    perhaps it can be argued that THOSE images are copyrightable, and therefore claim
    type copyrights by this argument....'

  body: I&#39;ve heard the term &#39;pastedown&#39; used too. IIRC, when &#39;pastedown&#39;
    was used, it referred to the paper &#40;or cloth&#41; pasted to the book board.
    And the &#39;endpaper&#39; was the first leaf.
