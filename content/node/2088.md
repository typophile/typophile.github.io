  body: Speaking of an international audience and implied W&#39;s, the rebranding
    of <a href="http://www.nwa.com/" target="_blank"> Nortwest Airlines</a> comes
    to mind. Their <a href="http://www.identityworks.com/Reviews/2003cases/nwa.html"
    target="_blank"> old logo</a> had a subtle w, which was quite well done, implying
    a compass pointing to northwest as well as the letters N and W, but in order to
    sound less regional &#40;Northwest&#41; their mark is now just &#34;nwa&#34; worked
    into the frame of the old logo. The problem is they still had to stick &#34;northwest&#34;
    into the logo. Another rebranding that, in my opinion, seemed like a good idea
    on paper but failed to hit the mark, no pun intended. &#40;I like the new paint
    job on the planes though&#41;  <BR> <BR><a href="http://mike.essl.com/more.php?id=163_0_1_0_M"

  body: I don&#39;t like to be a complainer, but the new NWA id sucks. It&#39;s been
    a while since I saw student work that bad. I just don&#39;t get how any designer
    or any client could look at that and say, &#34;that&#39;s the one, let&#39;s go
    for it.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Makes me scared to fly them, so much for my mileage points.

  body: Frankly, Northwest Airlines should have steered clear of the acronymization
    of their name. There &#39;s a whole demographic slice that attributes &#39;NWA&#39;
    with <a href="http://www.theiceberg.com/artist/25013/nwa.html">these guys</a>.

    as an example of clever and clear design.

  body: Hehehe!!! Grant, you totally read my mind.  <BR>-- <BR>Another thought. That
    arrow is pointing downward, this in itself has very negative connotations for
    me. &#40;Just noticed that Alexander mentioned this. So I agree with you about
    that.&#41;

  body: 'While I like this new livery, the new mark is really a shame. If they&#39;re
    really counting on people thinking this arrow points diagonally upward, they&#39;re
    asking people to remember their old logo. Silly. <BR> <BR>Re: saving money &amp;
    the livery <BR>I&#39;m not surprised that this livery design will save them money
    as the planes come in white, straight out of the factory. FedEx did the same thing
    when they moved away from their all purple trucks. <BR> <BR>When I worked on the
    JetBlue livery, I was interested to find out that a light colored top allows a
    plane to be more fuel efficient. &#40;A plane with a dark top requires more energy
    to cool.&#41; NWA&#39;s new livery will probably save them on operating costs
    over time.'

  body: i thought Dr. Dre bought the airline...;&#41; <BR> <BR>As far as the copyright
    on NWA, ... er, trademark. <BR> <BR>both parties have active trademarks that were
    granted in different classes... <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.uspto.gov/" target="_blank">www.uspto.gov/</a>
    <BR> <BR>The trademark examiner apparently determined that the likelihood of consumer
    confusion <BR>was low or non-existent and granted both parties trademarks. <BR>
    <BR>Either party could sue, claiming dilution, but acronyms are generally <BR>less
    distinctive than a unique brand name, such as Kodak. <BR> <BR>bj <BR>

  body: 'thats a real shame. <BR> <BR>the new logo is clunky, chunky and just plain
    ugly imo. especially when you compare it side by side with the original, it just
    looks pathetic. <BR> <BR>the original logo perfectly resolved the balance of all
    the elements, whereas the new one just seems to be haphazardly arranged, not to
    mention the typeface choice is unbelievably bad. <BR> <BR>the only real negative
    i can find about the old logo is the use of a serif instead of using a sans to
    compliment the symbol, and the tracked out &#34;airlines&#34;. <BR> <BR>quote:
    <BR>&#34;The new NWA identity was positioned as primarily a cost reduction exercise
    &#40;that&#39;s a first!&#41;... intended to lower future repainting costs by
    20% or so &#40;simpler design thus less masking, fewer colors, greater durability&#41;.
    More importantly, it&#39;s also an assertion: &#34;We&#39;re global, not regional;
    what&#39;s more we&#39;re very cool, like our best customers... smart, sophisticated,
    technically advanced and elegant.&#34; Livery design was inspired both by the
    Audi TT, and by Northwest&#39;s clean, functional new Detroit home terminal.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>this is really just crap. the words &#34;smart, sophisticated, technically
    advanced and elegant.&#34; are so far removed from my mind when i see this logo
    that its not funny. also whats to stop them from retaining the original logo and
    just redesigning the livery using fewer colours? <BR> <BR>talk about taking a
    backward step.'

  body: 'A few observations on the new NWA logo: <BR> <BR>Regarding the mark, when
    I first looked at the photo above, I immediately noticed that the placement of
    the triangle just underneath the windows near the front of the plane makes it
    look like a heart. Completely different interpretation &#40;&#34;heart of the
    northwest&#34; or some such nonsense&#41; <BR> <BR>Also, it&#39;s interesting
    to note that the triangle is more or less an equilateral triangle, so it could
    be seen as pointing to the left, not down &#40;although there would be better
    ways of doing this&#41;. <BR> <BR>'
