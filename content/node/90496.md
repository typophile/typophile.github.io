body: Anybody know what the lovely modern was that was used on the movie titles of
  last night's Academy Awards (84th)? I'm talking about the pink-hued titles that
  flashed as the announcers were calling out the nominated movies? Sorry, can't find
  a screen shot anywhere.

    you are referring to the ornaments around the tittle as shown in the images below.
    I think [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/astype/|ASTYPE]] has fonts which are
    similar. Also, have  a look at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/nat-vignette/|Nat
    Vignette]], as well as at fonts by [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Intellecta_Design/|Intellecta

  body: It IS Baskerville!...Somehow the G seemed just a tad more special than the
    usual Baskerville. Thanks for all your help.
