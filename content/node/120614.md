    match for Hans Moehring's Florida of 1932? Here is a larger scale specimen for
    comparison:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FloridaHansM\xF6hringWilhelmWoellmer1932SMgif_6181.jpg]\r\nNote
    the that the horizontal arms on _E_ and some other letters seem to have a wedge

  body: What I find particularly charming is the asymmetric |O| contrast, a feature
    almost never seen in typefaces (except maybe those which try to be playful).

  body: "Well done ! It seems indeed to be the Florida, too bad it does not exists
    in digital version.\r\n\r\nThe [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/luna/|ITC Luna
    ]] is for now the only one I found to have this crescent shaped O which was what
    striked me in the first place, but it has too much flair for the purpose I want.\r\nThe
    Kurosawa and Carisma are my two favorites right now. In my opinion, they both
    have this old yet modern feel to them.\r\n\r\nThanks a ton for your help and suggestions,
    I will definetly dig deeper in the lists !\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "REVISED to remove excess detail.\r\nCarisma  has similar  terminal structure
    to Venus but has less contrast.\r\nConsider _O_. The rhs of the _O_ in Venus is
    monoline with the stroke about as thick as the top and bottom stroke of Carisma
    Light. The lhs stoke is almost as thick as Carisma Regular.\r\nThe  rhs curved
    strokes of _B_, _D_, _P_, and _R_ as well as the rhs stroke for _U_ are similarly
    monoline.\r\nNote differences in  _G_, _R_,  _M_,  _J_, _W_, and _Q_ which has
    a tail similar to Retro Super Skinny.  \r\nI wonder which of the many other fonts
    suggested come as close as Clarisma or closer than Clarisma.\r\nDon"
