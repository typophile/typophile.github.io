  body: "@ Rachna:\r\n\r\nHere's a little trick when you've got a font that is close
    but not quite exact.\r\n\r\nGoto 'identifont.com' and enter 'Albertus' on the
    home page where it says 'Find a font'. When the detail shows click the 'Show more
    similar fonts...' link. In the left hand column a list will pop up that should
    be similar to the font you're looking at. This feature isn't available for every
    font but when it is it can come in very handy."
