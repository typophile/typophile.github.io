  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey everyone. This is technically my second font, but I&rsquo;m a newbie by all means.</p>
<p>This is a rough look at what I&rsquo;m working and I would love some basic feedback especially for any pitfalls that I should avoid now and in the future.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>I realize that the spacing isn&rsquo;t perfect yet. also if the image is too small to critique let me know and I&rsquo;ll post a better sample.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>/C/G/O/ are too perfectly elliptical that they are actually distracting.</p>
<p>/S/ has the problems where both curves meet - in the middle.</p>
<p>Some letters are based on ellipses others on circles, which makes letters look like they re from two different families.</p>
<p>Lowercase it too tight spaced. Word spacing with this letter spacing is way too wide. Some letters are too wide compared to others (ie. /V/).</p>
<p>Put /R/ and /K/ side by side. Do they look they&rsquo;re from the same family? I guess not.</p>
<p>But keep on doing it. With several adjustments it may become a nice display type. I&rsquo;m not so sure that this can be body type at all. At least not using these shapes and this kind of spacing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yeah I&rsquo;m not really sure what it can be either&hellip;I&rsquo;ve sort of just stumbled into this and realized how much I love it. I just need to get better at identifying certain things.</p>
<p>For some reason the /S/ has given me problems whenever I try to smooth out the middle curve, I guess I need more practice.</p>
<p>You also confirmed my suspicion that the widths of certain letters were not right comparatively&hellip;sometimes it gets so hard to tell when you stare at the same thing for too many hours.</p>
<p>I did try to narrow the stroke width on the top/bottom of /C/G/O/ but it&rsquo;s hard to tell. I don&rsquo;t like the G at all anyway, but wanted initial feedback so thank you.</p>
<p>Stylistically maybe you can answer this question for me. I have a small affinity for the way the T is very narrow and others are wider which is why I posted as is, but in this case is it trying to be two different things? In other words I can vary widths to create a less formal display type that is fun/loose but just not when using such geometric shapes?</p>
<p>I will nail down my style, workflow, &amp; chops soon enough. Thanks again</p>
