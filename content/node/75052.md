  I the only one who thinks this doesn't belong in the Hot New Fonts? I think it has
  very poor spacing and it doesn't take optical illusions in account. For example
  the strokes don't get thinner where they meet the stem, which creates a very ugly
  dark spot. If you're wondering why I post this: Well, I'm just very frustated crappy
  fonts like this actually sell. It seems as if the people who are supposed to be
  selecting the typefaces, do so without enough knowledge, which makes typedesign
  based on fashion, instead of lasting beauty. This mkes me seriously reconsider Myfonts
  as a platform to sell my expletus."

    in the HotFonts. We, type designers, masters or not (my case) have no all the
    true with us. So, if this font, and others, are in the Hot fonts is because someone
    like them and buy them. Artists works to the Kings, and to the people too. Vox

    the same way? A lot of these nuances don't make a huge difference (sometimes)
    in large display sizes. Maybe the designer <em>wanted</em> it to look blocky/have
    \"ugly dark spots.\" I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a poorly designed typeface...
    it may have a proper application somewhere, perhaps."

    At least get a degree from an art school before you get so snotty.\" Ok let's
    be honest. Whether it's arrogant or not, I think it simply doesn't look good at
    all. I might not have a degree from an art school, but I do believe I can reasonably
    judge the quality of typeface. Maybe I was exaggerating in this post, but I'm
    still very surprised that this typeface is so popular. I think if the designer
    deliberately made it look 'weird' (I can't make any more of it.), he should have
    made this clear in the description. From his description it seems he justed wanted
    to create simple, elegant, somewhat geometrical typeface. Arrogant or not, with
    or without art school degree, I think he failed."

    on this post and laugh with embarrassment. OK, so you've had some positive feedback
    on the Critique forum - it doesn't mean Expletus is the best thing since sliced
    bread. \r\n\r\nPomposity is not an admirable trait in the young, (nor the old
    for that matter).\r\n\r\nThe strange thing about type design is that when we first
    start down that path we all think we've just created the most brilliant, wonderfully
    original font ever, and praise and admiration must surely immediately follow.
    With a few typefaces under your belt you may revise your original opinion and
    think \"Hmmm, it's OK I suppose\". A few more years down the line you may think
    to yourself \"I'm not too bad at this now, I might even be pretty good eventually\".\r\n\r\nThis
    post reminds me of that Mark Twain quote about experience and the passage of time:\r\n\u201CWhen
    I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have
    the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished by how much
    he'd learned in seven years.\u201D"

    I won't be able to release a succesful typeface untill I have a degree from an
    art school. Now let me ask you a question. Not becease I think I already know
    the answer, but because I want to know the truth. Do you think this (knul) is
    a good typeface? How is it compared to expletus?\r\n\r\nI never said that I consider
    expletus worthy to be in the Hot New Fonts, nor do I think so. I just think that
    this (knul) typeface isn't either.\r\n\r\n\"This makes me seriously reconsider
    Myfonts as a platform to sell my expletus.\" This does sound very arrogant at
    a second look, but all I meant was that Myfonts atracts the kind of customers
    that I might not want to be associated with. If I do have an art school degree
    and a good font in the future, maybe I don't want to be 'that guy from myfonts'.\r\n\r\nThe
    rest is just my opinion about the font with, what i thought, are good arguments.
    I posted it on typophile, because i wanted to know what you thought about it,
    hence the question above in this comment."

    and has nothing to do with the quality of any particular font.\r\nThe only bad
    fonts are those which have encoding that doesn't work properly, or that are too
    obviously knock-offs.\r\nOtherwise, it's the typographer's responsibility to make
    \"good\" typography (however that is defined), and contrary to the old saying

    typing with one hand, since my left wrist is injured, so I try to keep things
    short. My comment was mainly towards nick cooke, because I didn't understand your

    schools and not at Jasper. As someone with an art degree who is teaching in two
    design programs and studying in yet another, I feel qualified to say that one
    can design type without an art degree. But a BFA from a typographically-aware
    design school sure does help.

    I think studing communications design (here in Germany) is from immense help for
    me. To be more precise, I think I already went a long way, yet I think there is
    still plenty to go for. Without attending university it would have taken maybe
    like 5-10 years getting where I am now. Maybe I would not have reached it ever.\r\n\r\nOf
    course it depends on how you study. Sitting around like in school, waiting for
    the wisdom to be put into your head by professors you get obviously nowhere. But
    if you get into action and understand studies as a base for your initiative it
    is a great catalyst.\r\n\r\nAs for the degree itself - a paper prooving you sit
    your ass flat for 4 years - yes. Completely useless. What counts is what you did
    with your time in university."

    sorry, but this does sound arrogant, making your first proper typeface, but already
    sure you want to exclude certain customers from buying it just because they have
    bad taste (in your opinion)... It doesn't show much respect for them, as you don't
    even know them. And by the way: Hot new fonts are defined purely by the amount
    of items sold, it doesn't judge the quality of them. And sales don't define a
    good typeface perse, otherwise Helvetica would not be such a big seller even after
    all those years.\r\n\r\nAnd about art school, it schould perhaps not be overrated,
    but it does help, it thaught me a lot, maybe not the things I should have been
    thaught, but still a lot ;-)"

    popular ITC Conduit. Knul is nothing like Expletus so there is no point comparing
    the two.\r\n\r\nWhat one person thinks beautiful another will think ugly and vice
    versa. You can't say your sensibilities are more refined than anyone else's, again
    that suggests a certain arrogance on your part.\r\n\r\nBTW, having an art school
