    It\u2019s none of the gazillion usual square sans suspects."

  body: This looks a lot like Hanno Bennert's Tramway font, which has been in the
    critique section for a while. See the thread [[http://www.typophile.com/node/37489|HERE]].

  body: "<em>This looks a lot like Hanno Bennert\u2019s Tramway font...</em>\r\n\r\nSure
    does. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere.\r\nSo, if it hasn\u2019t
    been released yet, how did it get used?\r\nWhere is the sample from?"

    out.

  body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nyes, that's indeed Tramway. Very cool, my own stuff
    in the ID forum :-). \r\n\r\nWhere is the sample from? So far, it's only been
    used for a handful of projects. The only people who use it on a regular basis
    are [[http://www.11freunde.de|11 Freunde magazine]] and, for a couple of weeks
    now, the [[http://www.museum-joanneum.at|Universalmuseum Joanneum]] in Graz.\r\n\r\nI'm
    currently working on the final version (I'm on it right now actually), which will
    just be called \"Tram\". It will have seven weights, possibly also corresponding
    italics, and yes, it WILL be released, as soon as possible ;-)\r\n\r\nI'll keep
    you updated...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nHanno\r\n\r\nPS: Here's a preview (a couple of
    months old now, but all the new weights are in there, as well as an unfinished
    italic): \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tram2009_5465.jpg]"

  body: "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nJan and Chris, thank you for identifying ...\r\n\r\nI
    got the sample from a friend. I guess he found the typeface in \"11 Freunde\".\r\n(I\u2019ll
    ask him.)\r\n\r\nHanno, beautiful work! For me Tramway combines the clearness
    of FF Unit with the squareness of \u2013 let me say \u2013 Cachet (I hope you
    like it when I put it this way). Let me know when it is going to be released.
    It\u2019s a case for Fontshop!\r\n\r\nBye for now!\r\nQuadrato"
