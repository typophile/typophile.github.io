  presents Rieven\u2122 Roman, by Steven Skaggs.\r\nAvailable now at: [[http://www.delvefonts.com/rieven_roman.html]]\r\n\r\nIn
  order to address those instances where the more contemporary letterforms are preferred,
  designer Steven Skaggs has expanded the Rieven family by creating a Roman version
  that can be used hand-in-hand with its predecessor, Rieven Uncial.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nUncial-specific
  forms were replaced by Skaggs with more conventional venetian forms and the lowercase
  of the accompanying italic is almost entirely re-drawn. With these features, Rieven
  Roman is ideal for lengthier passages of text in magazines, books, and websites.
  It can be used in tandem with Rieven Uncial for a consistent style, and optimal
  readability.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the Rieven Roman package is Rieven Ornaments, a
  font comprised of over 180 useful symbols, circled numbers, arrows, and decorative
  ornaments.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rieven_roman_specimen_3774.jpg]\r\n\r\nA
  type specimen (PDF) for Rieven Roman can be downloaded at: [[http://www.delvefonts.com/pdf/specimen_rieven_roman.pdf]]\r\n\r\nSteven
  Skaggs studied calligraphy and typography under Hermann Zapf. His calligraphic artworks
  are in the collections of the Klingspor Museum, Offenbach Germany, the Sackner Archive
  of Visual and Concrete Poetry in Miami, and the Akademie der K\xFCnst, Berlin. He
  has been active giving workshops and teaching throughout the United States as well
  as Canada, Italy, Switzerland and Germany. Steven Skaggs lives in Louisville, Kentucky
  where he is Professor of Design at the Hite Art Institute, University of Louisville.\r\n\r\nDelve
