  on a project in which I'm trying to mimic gravestone typography.\r\n\r\nI've recently
  been reading Robert Bringhurst's \"The Elements of Typographic Style\" which has
  detailed the use of fonts such as Mantinia and Augustea as classic stone engraving
  typefaces (whether designed specifically for that use or inspired by it).\r\n\r\nHowever,
  from my own research, there seems to be a lot more use of Caslon, Bodoni and Bembo
  in the modern day due to changing technologies in the way that the text is applied
  to the stone/granite/marble memorial.\r\n\r\nI was wondering peoples opinions on
  which is more relevant to communicating gravestone typography? And also, with the
  same question in mind, whether there are any specific layout styles synonymous with
  these memorials?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice you can offer.\r\n\r\n"
