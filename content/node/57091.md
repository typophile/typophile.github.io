  body: "Hi Ed,\r\n\r\nI've found a document that says it's called \"Spacey-Brand\".
    I assume it's custom made or customized (though I don't know on which basis) when
    Kevin Spacey took over the artistic direction.\r\n\r\n---\r\nFlxb"

    would've yielded <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/4440\">this thread</a>. Part
    of my explanation seems to have disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis is a custom typeface
    designed by R&D&Co for the Old Vic. I just found out that the east London consultancy

  body: "Thanks Yves. Funny thing is that I've tried searching for it and it says
    that I need \"at least one positive keyword with 4 characters or more.\". But
    that the mystery is solved is the what counts. \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nFlxb"

  body: Thanks people. Funny, it looked familiar so I assumed it wasn't a custom typeface.
    Maybe it just looks familiar because I cycle past it every day ...

  body: Just stumbled across this Thread by chance, for those interested I used to
    work for R&D&Co, it is indeed a custom font called 'Spacey' not 'Spacey-Brand'
    It was created as part of the re-brand for the Old Vic theatre company. The font
    comes in widths instead of weights (2 Weights). The font was designed by Rob Andrews
    of R&D&Co (which has since ceased trading).
