body: "I'm finishing the text of my PhD dissertation in computer science.  As the
  process wears on, I have the increasingly nagging feeling that I could have picked
  better faces, so I am interested in getting some advice.  Here are the constraints
  for my project:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I'm using pdfLaTeX and can employ OpenType fonts.</li>\r\n<li>I
  have licensed the Adobe Font Folio Education Essentials, the Adobe Type Classics
  for Learning, the faces that come with CS3, and several other (mostly sans) faces
  including Proxima Nova and Expo Sans.  I am open to licensing other faces if necessary,
  but am operating under quite a limited budget.</li>\r\n<li>I need a decent serif
  for text, and am partial to humanist and garalde styles. I also need a decent sans
  (or something) for things like programming-language keywords and names of relations;
  a good set of symbols for math; and a typewriter face for source code and command
  names (most of which are in figures but some of which have to appear inline).  I
  am open to suggestions for how to handle contrasting text that would obviate a sans,
  but the symbol and typewriter faces are necessary.</li>\r\n<li>I will be producing
  two versions of the document, with (hopefully minor) differences:  the first will
  conform to all of the typewriter-and-whiteout-era restrictions that universities
  impose on \"official\" copies of dissertations; the second will be unfettered by
  these constraints (thus, hopefully more attractive) and designed for screen viewing
  or low-resolution print.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nRight now, I'm using Arno Pro, Cronos
  Pro, and AMS Euler.  I like Arno pretty well but am not really that happy with the
  Arno/Cronos pairing (the x-height of Cronos is just a little too high), and Euler
  seems to me to be merely the least bad choice for math.\r\n\r\nI have considered
  just going with Computer Modern, which has delightful nostalgia value for young
  computer scientists (since nearly all of our textbooks were set in it) but is unattractive.
  \ I have also considered Myriad and Minion, which is a safe but generic pairing,
  and Warnock and Cronos, which looks good in several books and dissertations that
  I've enjoyed reading lately.\r\n\r\nI've attached a page from an older draft of
  my dissertation that is notable for containing math, sans and serif text, and monospace.
  \ (It also contains some typos, sorry!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nwb"

  body: If you like Garalde you should try Garamond Premier Pro. And I think Cronos
    would work well with that too. On the other hand Warnock is still fresh for me
    and I still enjoy seeing it used in longer text settings.

  body: Thanks, Tiffany!  I love Garamond Premier Pro but hadn't considered it for
    this project -- but tried it out and am surprised at how well it works with Cronos.
