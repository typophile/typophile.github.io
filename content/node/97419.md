  body: There is some wonkyness where the word media spans the space in the title.
    I agree about finding a more suitable font or even doing some hand lettering.
    I get the concept, but it isn't clever enough for me to go past a one-to-one understanding
    of it. In other words, it is called 'beaker' and you have an image of a beaker.
    Too obvious perhaps? Could the beaker also contain some imagery that suggested
    media? I am thinking hip and clever, not corny.

    I prefer simplicity in a logo, but the beaker area looked dull and it was a suggestion
    off the top of my head. It's more visually interesting now, although it now has
    details that won't hold up in small sizes. \r\n\r\nTo be honest, when I'm designing
    a logo, most of the ideas I have don't pan out. That's the nature of the process.
    You try lots of things, reject most of them, refine some, tear out your hair,
    and days/weeks later you finally come up with something good. Maybe."

    soft curves.\r\nhttp://eventcamptwincities.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/beaker_icon-007.png\r\nFind
    a font like that, and when you replace the \"A\" with a nice beaker it'll click

    off how creative and great your process can be. I still don''t know why it is

    people to think when they experience your branding: fun or serious, youthful or
    experienced, edgy or reliable, flashy or subtle, emotional or rational, etc. Get
    in the lab with those carefully considered ingredients and start experimenting
    with keywords, imagery, type styles, word mapping, free association, doodles,
    photos, mood boards, and any other strategy that you can come up with to generate
    some material to manipulate and evaluate. This is the ideation phase of the experiment.
    The goal is to get as many different ideas as you can, and not care if they are
