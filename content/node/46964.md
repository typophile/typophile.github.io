  to digitize a font entails...\r\nFontographer or Fontlab?  Is it reasonable to expect
  to learn from a book, or is a class necessary?\r\nIt seems incredibly painstaking...
  is it better to just hire someone to execute my designs?"

  body: You certainly could hire someone to execute your designs. I could use the
    work for sure, but I'm hardly the most qualified around here. Then again, they're
    pretty busy people.

  body: You could learn by doing. Develop your chops using bezier drawing tools. Buy
    a copy of a font editor and start hammering away at your design. You'll find out
    pretty quick if you have the stamina to do type design. Remember, the first 40
    or 50 fonts are the hardest.  After that, it goes from being really painful, to
    only somewhat painful. But the pain never really goes away, it just changes from
    being your enemy to being your friend.

    letters makes your eyes start closing on their own accord.

    for a novice?  Fontlab is pricey!

    are really going to do it. Investing in a couple of books is peanuts, and will
    likely save you scores of hours.\r\n\r\nAlso note: if you're scared of the cost
    of FontLab, you definitely can't afford to hire a professional to do a font for
    you. But maybe you could afford a student or something....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
