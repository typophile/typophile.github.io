  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am currently studying Cert V in digital graphic design, online.
As part of one of the assessments I had to design a logo for the Geelong Football Umpires' League and gather feedback on the design.
So here is my design. Any feedback would be great.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A logo should always work in one colour, and at multiple sizes.
Your choice of fonts is very cartoon like.
The whistle doesn&rsquo;t indicate what game the Geelong Football Umpires' actually umpire.
I would try to incorporate some aspect of the game.
Also your whistle is very cartoonish.
Umpires are professional people who do a serious job.
You need to use cleaner less frivolous fonts, and more stylish adult artwork.
With less &lsquo;garish&rsquo; colours. The cyan you&rsquo;ve used is way too loud.</p>
<p>I did a quick search in Google for &lsquo;umpire logos&rsquo;</p>
<p>These were my favourites.

<img src="/images/old-images/PBUC_400px_splash_4561.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>and the football teams themselves seem to use an clean illustrative style, like these.

<img src="/images/old-images/url_5393.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Perhaps you could develop something along a similar line so it fits in with the games overall branding style.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi and thanks for your feed back. you have given me a lot to think about.
The four lines that are in the circle of the whistle are meant to represent the game of AFL which are the goal post&rsquo;s used in the game, however unless you live in Australia you wouldn&rsquo;t know otherwise.
once again thank you for your feedback and comments.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;ve obviously rushed that, as it&rsquo;s not very well aligned.
The typefaces should be the same weight or at least complimentary styles.
I also think for a Geelong football logo the font should have a stronger, bolder, more masculine feel.</p>
<p>The words Geelong follows (badly) the oval shape in a fan shape, where as the Football Association (also badly aligned with the curve of the ball) follows the vertical Arch shape.</p>
<p>Also the 4 lines are not equal distance from the out edge of the ball.
This is very sloppy, and really shows a lack of care. In future look at every aspect of what you design.
As a tip to see if it&rsquo;s balanced, you should also check it out in a mirror.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;ve still got a long way to go yet, but you can do it.</p>
<p>What about a stylised whistle in outline, have you tried anything like that yet.

Or do the umpires have any special clothing, or hand signals, or extra gear?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one you can have from me. It&rsquo;s got the whistle shape, the Gee, and the 4 football stripes. :)

<p>or you could even do it in an oval shape.
