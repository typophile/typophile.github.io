body: "Long story short... the web team began working on a sub-brand with a sales/marketing
  consultant and suddenly, I see a pretty sophomoric usage of Helvetica Neue (our
  corp. typeface) and a free script typeface running around the Blog, and a few email
  blasts.\r\n\r\nI want to present an alternative since it's seems like it's in the
  early stages. This will include an entirely different concept, but out of respect
  and play politics... I'm going to also present a version with Helvetica Neue Bold
  and a scripted typeface.\r\n\r\nMy explorations have landed me with this selection:\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/calgary-script//|Calgary
  Script]] by Sudtipos.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to have any other suggestions, I'm totally
  game. The most challenging bit about it all is that these items are being used along
  side a logo that uses Helvetica Neue Bold with a lock up of Helvetica Neue Medium.
  I have made something similar in the PDF so I can protect the integrity of the company."

  body: As you can see... they're all pretty horrible. How am I going to bring the
    brand back on track?

  body: I like the second and third choices. You just need to use a script that doesn't
    clash with the proportions of Helvetica.

  body: "Thanks for the feedback.\r\nThe first image is the actual logo sub-brand.\r\nThe
    second is the original \"Blog\" logo, which I am trying to change. I've actually
    kerned it, as it was pretty horrible before.\r\nCounting down from the original,
    I feel the 3rd (the italics one) is the strongest:\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/australiantype/halvorsen-pro/|Halvorsen
    Pro Extra Bold Italic]]\r\n\r\nHopefully I can at least, get this signed off on.
    We'll see if the other concept gets traction."

  body: Some of these look like they are getting there but something done by hand
    would probably create a greater harmony of the elements, rather than trying to
    make something fit the purpose.
