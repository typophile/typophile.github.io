  body: It's some variant of <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-caslon/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26seed%3D28%26dock%3D0%26size%3D57%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DPortnoy%25E2%2580%2599s%2520Complaint%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dsingle%252Cot.liga">Caslon
    Bold</a>. The Font Bureau version in the link has two versions--one that's about
    the right weight but too condensed, and one the right width but not bold enough.
    There were a lot of film font versions of this, and I'm guessing it's one of them.
    The swashes were probably part of it, too, although they look like they are from
    a wider version.
