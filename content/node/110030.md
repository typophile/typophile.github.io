  can help me. I'm a writer and have wandered into what seems a minefield regarding
  the legalities of using Fonts! \r\nI have several fonts which I need to identify.
  I also hope someone can give me some advice.\r\n\r\nA friend who sadly passed away
  created several book covers for me  but the question of Fonts never came up back
  then, so I don't know what Fonts he used  Can you take a look at them and identify
  them for me Please.\r\nTo be sure I'm doing the right thing, I need to know if it
  is LEGAL to use the fonts on a website as well as maybe as an e- book cover (and
  later print version). I have added the images below. Please please Help!\r\nAdvice....\r\nIt
  is freaking me out, because some places say \"Free\" fonts...and I don't know if
  that's True.. but then there's something about 'copyright'  and you need to credit
  the owner, which I want to do- It's probably me being dumb But it is Really difficult
  trying to Find the owners!\r\nI need to know How and Where do I put the credits
  for them. Can anyone tell mehow to do this..eg if I use the images on a video?\r\nDavid
  font...\r\nOne font I do know is named \"David\" and on many sites it is claimed
  to be Free.. but when I tried to find the owner..to ask permission as well as credit
  them, I could find Nothing! Does anyone know what I should do - if anything - regarding
  this?\r\nAny help would be very much appreciated. Thanks. Nat.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/charlybushzonesfont_4069.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/risqfonts_6516.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RisqueBusiness_3658.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rockstarFont_5545.jpg]"

  body: "CHARLY is <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/victorian/' target='_blank'>Victorian</a>
    - manually made heavier. It's a good example to clarify how to use fonts commercially.
    If you purchase a copy of the font from a centralized seller like MyFonts or Fontshop
    - or directly from Linotype - it comes with a license that spells out how it may
    be used. On MyFonts, you can view the end user license before you pay for the
    font. With proof of payment and a license allowing commercial use (virtually all
    commercial fonts), you are good to go to use the font in your project. No need
    to credit anyone.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of free font websites call themselves
    that because they are giving away fonts that youcan download without paying. thte
    often include lots of commercial fonts they have no right to give away. You could
    find Victorian on plenty of these sites, but using such an illicit download commercially
    would be a mistake. Lots of other fonts on these sites are ripoff clones of commercial
    fonts. Those too it would be inadvisable to use.\r\n\r\nOh, and then there are
    the legitimately free font creations out there. Those almost always had documentation
    with them that might spell out any usage limitations - but those free font sites
    rarely include that documentation.\r\n\r\nHow to know what's what? Ask us here!
    That's my nutshell version. Others will surely be able to expand and clarify."

    body: "Mike, Thanks so much for everything you did - especially explaining things,
      it was very helpful.\r\nI have taken out the Text on those images and am now
      looking for the genuine Free fonts.\r\nI created an e-book cover - for everyone
      else it seems easy to do... for me, it was more like splitting the atom!!\r\nso,
      I was very upset when I came across the Legal questions about using fonts.\r\n\r\nSo...
      may I ask Another question, please. I recently used software called Paint.net
      and they have text options on it.  Apparantly they purchased this software from
      Microsoft, if that helps.\r\n \r\nAre those Fonts okay to use? The one I want
      to use is called DAVID - I posted and image of it on the previous posting. I
      have emailed Paint.net direct to ask them...but I don't know if they will reply,
      so I hope you guys will be able to tell me. Regards, Nat.\r\n\r\n"

  body: BUSIN (ESS) is <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/cascade-script/familytree.html'
    target='_blank'>Cascade</a>. You'll see it's offered under a couple of names by
    several foundries. That's because various foundries have cross licensing agreements.

  body: "Hi Mike. This is an excellent introduction of the issues of how a designer
    can use a font. A major question for designers is whether a font can be legitimately
    modified for logos artwork etc. I wonder if we have a FAQ that does or could include
    this type of info?\r\nAs for license documentation with free fonts, the best site
    I have seen is Font Squirrel. Dafont is part way there.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Natalie, you raise some questions that go way beyond font ID. Perhaps
    the gurus in http://typophile.com/forum/7 or http://typophile.com/forum/4 could
    do a better job of answering them. But perhaps Mike wants to take another run
    at this?\r\nDon"

  body: "Yikes - as Don said, this is going way beyond the scope of this forum.\r\n\r\nI
    hope I made it clear above that you aren't going to find Victorian or Cascade
    as \"genuine Free fonts\" because they are commercial fonts you need to pay for
    to be licensed to use commercially (or even privately, for that matter).\r\n\r\nNext,
    Paint.net was not purchased from MS. It was originally a college senior project
    that MS mentored, per the website (getpaint.net , if anyone else wants to check
    it out). I'm not certain, but it sounds like the program simply uses the fonts
    that are already on your computer. Regarding the font David - if you know how
    to find David in your Fonts folder, right-click on it, choose Properties and see
    if you can find any copyright info on one of the tabs.\r\n\r\nIf you find copyright
    info, let us know what it is and we <em>might</em> be able to clarify the status
    of David. Beyond that, Don provided links to two forums that would be more appropriate
    for legal questions."
