  close with franklin gothic, but I'm not sure. I'm especially interested in the fat
  font that says \"ROCKY II\".\r\n\r\nthanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rockyII_4240.jpg]"

  body: Most of it is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/franklin-gothic/">Franklin
    Gothic Condensed and Extra Condensed</a>. "ROCKY II" is probably an extra heavy
    film font version of Franklin Gothic that pre-dates the DTP era or it may be custom.
    The <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/ITCFranklin/styles">newly released
    version of ITC Franklin by Font Bureau</a> has an extra heavy weight that may
    be close.
