  crafter, she wants some thing she can stamp on the back of cards she makes and sew
  into blankets and things like that.\r\n\r\nI am pretty happy with it and she likes
  it, but everytime I look at it I feel like it isn't finished.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3853154814_456d21187e_6018.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank
  you."

  body: Had a real hard time trying to write what I would have done, so I made a rough
    sketch to give you an idea about the concept. Maybe you've already been down this
    road, but theres something about that bendy leg on your M that disturbs me. And
    because I need symmetry :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5018.jpg]

    I am wondering whether you have tried to have a similar curve/bend on the left
    leg as you have on the right side? '

  body: "While I too initially desired for there to be more symmetry in this, I'd
    hate to lose the nice loopiness that is there. There are a few places where the
    curviness gets a little bit too wonky, though. Each of the strokes that lead into
    the curls widen and curve at awkward places. Work on making the transition from
    straight to curved areas smoother.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "Not crazy about the suggested solutions. Integrating the 'V' into the 'M'
    itself is a bit too obvious. I think the reason why the original MV feels unfinished
    is that the serifs are so strong, and so heavy on the left side of the logo. Try
    removing the serifs and rework the letters so that it feels more balanced.\r\n\r\n^^\r\n\r\ni
    take it back. the serifs might work, i think the only problem i had with the suggestions
    is executing the V in the dip of the M in a very obvious way. there might be a
    solution in there, but it will require some finagling."

  body: "@fruktbart  Thank you for the suggestion. That is the direction I first went
    with this project, but we weren't happy with it, it was to much of a traditional
    monogram.\r\n\r\nI think it may be the wonkieness of the thick and thins that's
    bugging me the most. I'm going to try and work on the curves.\r\nThat's what I
    get for basing this on Harrington...\r\n\r\nThanks for all your comments.\r\n"

  body: "The other issue I think is where the right leg of the \"M\" goes into the
    \"V\". It feels like a turkey wishbone being pulled apart. Because of that, you're
    losing some much needed stability.\r\n\r\npenn"
