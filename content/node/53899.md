body: "I wandered about Mid-city and the LGD to find and photograph some of New Orleans'
  unique signage. The imagery and type found runs the gamut from hand drawn and painted
  to neon and commercial. The signage represents a part of New Orleans culture and
  parts of my life, past and/or present, pre-Katrina and changes post-Katrina. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocally
  owned corner store whose exterior used to have a only a spray paint piece of plywood
  to display its name\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freshmeat_6689.jpg]\r\nMy
  sister's store on Magazine\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/resevoir_6383.jpg]\r\nThe
  Abstract Bookshop. Once a youth hostel/cafe/bookshop with poetry, music and plays
  turned recovery home for persons with addiction and mental illness. Now closed,
  but still a beautiful part of the Magazine Street landscape. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abstract1_5291.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shamrock_5487.jpg]\r\nMmmmm,
  Mmmmmmm\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/teeevas_5252.jpg]\r\n\r\nUpset #1:
  Since Katrina, the strip mall that housed RockNBowl, Central Latino SuperMarket
  and a thrift store has been remodeled leaving the exterior bare and bland- stripping
  away the beautiful handrawn type that made it so homegrown and had really expressed
  the vibe of Mid City Lanes. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/outdoorsign3_4507.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rocknbowl_4423.jpg]\r\n\r\nUpset
  #2: As I began my assignment I knew that the very first sign I wanted to photo was
  the Crystal Preserves sign in Mid-City off I-10. This sign in particular has always
  had a special meaning to me. When I was a kid and my parents would take my sisters
  and I to plays, ballets and concerts downtown we would head home, getting onto the
  I-10 at Tulane and Carrolton. I would stare up out the window at this huge glowing
  sign and know that my parents were finishing off the night by treating us to beignets
  and hot cocoa at Morning Call. I was highly upset to see the sign gone, which still
  stood after Katrina, and some sort of condos being built where the Baumer Foods
  factory stood =(\r\n(Internet Image of the Crystal Preserves Sign)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/crystal_preserves-sm_4983.jpg]\r\n(Crystal
