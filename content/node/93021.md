    all Museos are free. And we don\u2019t know why Juvina asked a cheap alternative.\r\nI
    prefer to suggest a good free typeface instead of a \u201Ccheap\u201D alternative.
    \r\nAnd I will help, if possible, someone who\u2019s asking nicely (since there
    are too many people who instead  pretend or presume that all fonts are free)."

    to prevent their own from inflation. As for PayPal, in some countries it is just
    not available. In Bulgaria we have it for 3-4 years. Before that - no.\r\n"
