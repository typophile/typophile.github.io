  2 new fonts at critiq forum!)\r\n\r\nThis new thread is for me (and for you) to
  post unknown signs.\r\n\r\nI have 2 that I want to know were are they from:\r\nI
  know that they are from Latin, but are they still used? where they modified? etc...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Signs_4862.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks

    <em>atque</em> (and), <em>eamque</em> (same) and <em>utru<strong>m</strong>que</em>
    (either)...

  body: The first one appears to be a double <strong>i</strong> ligature (<em>Herbariis</em>),
    with a <strong>j</strong> used for the second <strong>i</strong>, similar to the
    <strong>fs</strong> combination sometimes used in early printing to represent
    the double-<strong>s</strong> ligature.

  body: "Oldnick is right, the sign similar to a qz contraction is a <strong>que</strong>
    ligature used at the end of the words in late Latin (mostly Medieval). You may
    find que and qua in the middle of words, where the ligature is not used.\r\n\r\nYou
    may do a Google search about any of these words using [ue] at the end \u2013like
    atq[ue]. The [ue] is a graphical standard to this ligature.\r\n\r\nThe other is
    a <strong>ij</strong> ligature. Accord to the age of document or inscription,
    you may find it as ii or ij. This is because J does not exist in early Latin,
    it was added much later. So there are IUS and JUS in different Latin inscriptions."

    the range of publication were typographers from 17th Century use to adapt another
    type to a new function.\r\n\r\nDo not understand me wrongly. I'm not saying that
    section mark \u2013or ANY mark\u2013 was not subject to improvisation or experiments.
    But for this kind of text, this was not usual.\r\n\r\nThis <em>may</em> be a section
    mark, the context where it was applied suggest this. But it does not seem to be
    a rotated x with two dots. Instead, it seems to be a cut made for this purpose
    and thus would be found in other texts."

    parts of old Justinianus Codex and point that in its capt. 5 follows the text

    ff. is to verify if there are any \"normal\" ff. in the text. As there are many

    it would originated this <em>x</em>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Strass</strong>: Q is followed
