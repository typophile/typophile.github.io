body: "Dear all,\r\n\r\nI am currently in midst of designing a new form for the social
  security office of the city of Gothenburg in Sweden for the application of financial
  benefits. The situation of government related documents in Sweden is rather unique,
  since there are no centralised designs or house fonts and every county can decide
  on their own forms.\r\n\r\nThe form is double-sided A3 sheet, which is folded in
  the middle and has been designed in constant feedback with both social security
  workers and benefit seekers. However, I am still looking for a suitable font.\r\n\r\nThe
  font needs to be a sans serif which works well in small sizes (8pt for the most
  part). Apart from the disclaimer at the end, it will not be set in continuous text,
  but rather in single lines underneath the boxes to fill out. It should have a somewhat
  accessible nature and needs to include the standard Swedish letters \xD6, \xC4,
  \xC5. \r\n\r\nThere is a large group of benefit seekers with an immigrant background
  so there will be a filling out help which is translated into Arabic and possibly
  Somali. If the fonts has some fitting equivalents in these languages it would be
  a huge benefit.\r\n\r\nHope any of you might have some knowledge about design of
  forms or for governments and can help me with this.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "All Somali orthography I've seen in Sweden has used Roman type, with the
    only special character being a prime mark glottal stop. Other languages that you'd
    generally see translations into include Finnish, Farsi, Spanish, Albanian, Polish,
    Sorani, Latin-orthography Serbian and perhaps some Cyrillic-alphabet ones, perhaps
    even Mongolian. So wide character set in both Arabic and Roman (and maybe Cyrillic)
    is a good policy.\r\n\r\nA really bloody-literal-minded government agency might
    even include Hebrew-alphabetted Yiddish, which after all is one of our five official
    national minority languages...\r\n\r\nedit: Oh, and Thai is a definite, slightly
    scary prospect. You should probably check out exactly what translations will happen
    before settling on a font.\r\n\r\nedit 2: the national social insurance agency
    (F\xF6rs\xE4kringskassan) has all the languages above, including Thai and Russian
    (but not Mongol or Yiddish), Nothern Sami (hello \u014B!), Dari, Turkish, Kurmanci
    as well as, to make it even harder, Tigrinja."

  body: "Thanks for the replies. \r\n\r\n@ Birdseeding: Since this form will only
    be used in the city of G\xF6teborg and is specifically tailored for their needs,
    the only translations needed are in English, Arabic, and Somali. This is because
    these are the most common languages needed within this specific area.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
    the compatibility with those scripts wasn't in fact my main concern.\r\n\r\nI
    was wondering if any of you knew sans serif fonts that have been used in form
    design and proven to work well both in legibility and \"friendly\" character.
    \r\n\r\n( @ hrant: sans serif was a requirement of the office)\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n"

    can only guess that sans serif fonts stand for their perception of what modern
    and approachable design is and tie in with the rest of the print material they
    put out.\r\n All my remarks about better legibility of serif type faces in small
    sizes were simply dismissed. "
