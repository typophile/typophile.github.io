  but same thing happens also when I'm trying to save a Word document as a PDF file
  (MS Word 2010).\r\nThis happens only when I insert pictures into a page. Saving
  in PDF makes text appear black when pictures inserted. Please see the attached pictures
  of normal text and abnormal text in case of a picture inserted. I also have Acrobat
  X Pro installed. I have no printers connected to my PC.\r\nPlease if anyone could
  tell me how to fix this bug?\r\nThanks a lot in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text_6649.png]"

    when text-areas touch and/or overlap images and is caused by \u2018flattening\u2019.
    To solve this most designers place text in a separate layer on top,"

  body: Same bug for RGB and CMYK. It looks like transparency issue. My pictures have
    transparency enabled and they are in PNG format. I have just tried to save a picture
    in jpeg format and use it in InDesign instead of PNG picture and it fixed the
    problem. Is there any way how can I use PNG picture files as I need to convert
    lots of PNGs to JPEGs to solve this problem of bold black text appearance. Is
    there any workaround? Thank you.

  body: "Okay, it looks like the only solution is to insert PNG files without transparency
    enabled in them, this works. So I will recreate all 500+ pictures manually with
    transparency disabled.\r\n\r\nThank you all for the tips guys! Looks like the
    problem is solved now."

    (Adobe PDF 1.3). But pay attention if it harms your transparent pictures.
