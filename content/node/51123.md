    signs are informative or visual pollution, and don't really control behaviour.\r\nTraffic
    flow is the exception."

    Nick\u2014aside from traffic signs, I pretty much treat all signs as suggestions.\r\n\r\n<cite>I
    often read the sign \u201Cpush\u201D on a glass door from the wrong side, and
    push.</cite>\r\n\r\nI do that, too. It really pissed of some secret service guys
    when I started messing around with the door at Barnes & Noble when a gaggle of
    Japanese dignitaries were buying magazines. \r\n"
