  body: "First sample: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/chinese-rocks/|Chinese
    Rocks]]\r\nSecond sample:\r\n - headline: hard to say, very generic and few letters,
    could be as easy as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/|Helvetica
    Neue Condensed]] (Black or Heavy) or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-din/pro-cond-black/|DIN
    Condensed Black]] (which makes sense with body text)\r\n - body text: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-din/|DIN]]"
