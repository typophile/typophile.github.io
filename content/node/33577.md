  some searching I got to \r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/show?4W1\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Carplates_3593.gif]\r\nwhich
  is close, but no sigar. Does anybody know of any other digitisations of the typeface
  of the British Carplated? \r\nOr the name of the font in the sample above?\r\n\r\nThx"
