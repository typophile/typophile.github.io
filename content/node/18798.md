body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nThink Verdana. I want to start designing a new font and I want
  to use an underlaying screen grid to get the geometry of the glyphs just right.
  I don't want to make a grid-font, but want to use the screen grid as a starting
  point for the porportions. The font should be something like Verdana, Helvetica,
  DIN, or so. \r\n\r\nIs there anyone that has ever worked this way? Perhaps you have
  some information on the topic or just anything to get me started the right way.\r\n\r\nI
  hope that this way the font better works onscreen (in the right pixel size) and
  might therefor needs less hinting. On the other hand it should work best in print.
  Therefor the underlaying grid is just a starting point.\r\n\r\nThanx,\r\n\xAEen\xE9"

    this perhaps what you mean?\r\n\r\nPieter"

    needs less hinting\r\n\r\nAlthough this would only really work out for a single
    PPEM size.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Fedra Sans, not designed specifically to be a pixel font, but to work just as
    well in print as it does on screen by making some of the forms relate to the grid
    structure. So that may be a good reference.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/imgs/static/custom_type.jpg"

  body: "Thomas, that's what I need. I knew someone did this before, but couldn't
    find it again or remember who it was.\r\nHrant, sure it works for a specific PPEM
    size, but that's fine. I think most fonts on screen are used between 10 and 13
    pixels (correct me if I'm wrong). Pixel fonts can go smaller.\r\n\r\nIs there
    more info out there? Just experiences from people who did this procedure before.
    I don't want to step into any (to me) unknown pitfalls. \r\n\r\nThanx!\r\n\xAE"
