  properly create Hebrew typeface software in MicroSoft Volt, the tool for creating
  'advanced' OpenType fonts, the type designer should also have an \"advanced\" knowledge
  of Hebrew grammar and correct diacritical placement.\r\n\r\nI intend to create a
  set of Hebrew typeface software 'advanced' OpenType fonts, both for Biblical Hebrew,
  and for \"enhanced\" or vocalized Hebrew.\r\n\r\nThe basis for doing this correctly
  is the establishment of Hebrew grammar rules, which I decided can best be achieved
  by understanding the writings of essential great Hebrew grammarians, such as R'
  Zalman Henna."

  body: "R' Zalman Henna divides his book, \"Foundation of the Nikkud\", into 10 chapters.
    He labels his chapters as 'gates', \u05E9\u05E2\u05E8\u05D9\u05DD. \r\n\r\nHenna's
    first gate is: \"Gate of Letters\". It has 14 enumerated paragraphs, which Henna
    calls: 'fundementals' or 'foundations', \u05D9\u05E1\u05D5\u05D3\u05D5\u05EA.\r\n\r\nIn
    his first fundemental lesson, Henna reiterations how Hebrew letters are sounded,
    and their graphic form reflects that sound (without explaining how specific is
    the graphic form of each letter designed based upon the sound that letter makes)."

  body: "First, Henna quotes the early Hebrew language grammarians, \u05D4\u05DE\u05D3\u05E7\u05D3\u05E7\u05D9\u05DD.
    They called the vocal instruments which produced the sounds which we refer to
    as letters by the term, \u05DE\u05D5\u05E6\u05D0\u05D5\u05EA, motzaot.\r\n\r\nWhat
    are 'motzaot'?\r\n\r\n'Motzaot' comes from the same common Hebrew word, '\u05DE\u05D5\u05E6\u05D9\u05D0',
    like the blessing of '\u05D4\u05DE\u05D5\u05E6\u05D9\u05D0 \u05DC\u05DB\u05DD
    \u05DE\u05DF \u05D4\u05D0\u05E8\u05E5', 'He brings forth the bread from the earth'.
    Similarly, these 'motzaot' bring forth the letter-sounds from the areas of the
    mouth.\r\n\r\nHenna lists these areas as 5: a) the throat, b) the palate, c) the
    tongue, d) the teeth, and e) the lips.\r\n\r\n"

    which the y axis was relative the definition of the x axis. Although it was not
