  All of the printed work is being done in Indesign. Anyone have books/articles to
  recommend?

    are out of date and more web focused, but may help you get oriented with the basics.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome
    quick tips:\r\n\r\nAlmost all body text is justified.\r\n\r\nYou can set up composite
    fonts in InDesign to use Western and Japanese fonts inline together, with InDesign
    making automatic sizing/alignment adjustments based on rules you define.\r\n\r\nThere
    are rules for widows, maybe too much to explain here, but if you search around
    on the web you should be able to find them (maybe search for something about japanese
    writing rather than design)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    of Japanese work with InDesign. They also have some templates that provide access
    to Japanese features from the Roman build of InDesign available for download.
    \ I found this [[http://www.techart.com/downloads/ID&WL-Part2.pdf|article]] using
    Google that looks pretty useful and contains information about their templates."
