  faces\u201D, but is there a close relative - or perfect match! - to these three
  letterforms? And yes, the resolution and detail in one of the attached files are
  unfortunately both lousy.\r\n\r\nThe smaller \u201C4AD\u201D file was taken from
  the official website. The \u201Clarger\u201D one seems probably an stylization or
  maybe an earlier incarnation, as the counters seems to occupy much more space.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance and have a good day, typophiles!\r\n\r\n:  )"

  body: I'm looking at as big a version of the official logo as I've found, and I'm
    not sure the bracket actually looks like that. http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ncaZo6k5J7s/TLVCstPJMNI/AAAAAAAAAD4/UQ2l9nbMU_Q/s1600/irona_kisse_pr1_300d_11010.jpg

title: Uppercase, serif, fat face, extreme stroke variation, with some slab-like serifs
  and one numeral. And one VERY ODD bracket.
