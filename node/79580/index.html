		<div class="commentbody"><p>Derision does not help to promote dialogue and understanding.</p>
<p>But it is necessary to understand <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why<!-- raw HTML omitted --> little else but derision is the reaction to your recommendation concerning the shape of the 11th letter in the Latin alphabet.</p>
<p>Your stated reason for changing the letter is that its current shape promotes suicidal thoughts because it resembles a junction of rivers where a famous battle between Gods took place, as recorded in Hindu scriptures.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of users of the Latin alphabet are not believing members of the Hindu faith. So, to them, this is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not a reason<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Latin alphabet users are usually Christians; Christianity takes a different view of other faiths than Hinduism does. Hinduism is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->syncretistic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; that is, if the Muslims say that an angel came down and spoke to Muhammad, or the Jews say that God parted the Red Sea so that their ancestors could escape slavery in Egypt, Hindus generally don&rsquo;t feel a need to say that these things didn&rsquo;t actually happen.</p>
<p>The view taken by Christianity (and related religions such as Judaism and Islam) towards other faiths is very different. They believe that their holy books are the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sole and exhaustive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> record of all interactions between humanity and the Divine.</p>
<p>If it isn&rsquo;t in the Bible, it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Outside the Bible, of course, most of the purely natural events of human history took place. Possibly black magic, done by Satan and his demons, could also occasionally take place - some Christians believe this to be possible, others do not accept this as a possibility Christians should accept.</p>
<p>So anything miraculous that is not in the Bible, or that doesn&rsquo;t promote Christianity (or, before Christ, Judaism) - since some Christian faiths do accept the idea of their present-day saints performing miracles in addition to those recorded in the Bible - is either something that never happened, but was simply a made-up human legend, or it was an example of the dark powers of the demons of Hell.</p>
<p>Other religions may teach people to respect their parents, to be faithful to their spouses, not to steal or do violence. But in no other religions but their own is the presence and power of God made manifest.</p>
<p>So the traditions of Hinduism say there is something wrong with the shape of the 11th letter of our alphabet. Since we are not ourselves Hindus, and since our own religious outlook is the opposite of syncretistic, we do not consider the teachings of the Hindu faith to have the kind of value - as accurate history, or authentic revelation - to be in any way useful as a source of new information, in addition to that which we have from reason, that could serve as a guide to action.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, people here see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->absolutely no reason whatsoever<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to exert the slightest effort to change the forms of their alphabet, but you present your proposed change in a way that implies that it&rsquo;s obvious that we should see the merit in this idea, they wonder why you can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s obvious to them - that your rationale for this change has no substance.</p>
<p>@Té Rowan:
The foregoing may address your point somewhat as well.</p>
<p>Because Hinduism is a syncretistic faith, Hindus have no problem in believing that Jesus might have been a genuine Avatar, and worked genuine miracles. And, so, while they wouldn&rsquo;t convert to Christianity because of it, they might well accept that Christian scriptures also contain some real messages from God - and so they might accept, for example, the new information that the number 666 is unlucky, instead of reacting the way <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do to things from other faiths - if it isn&rsquo;t our religion, it&rsquo;s purely human superstition, nothing more.</p>

<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, U+0915 and U+004B are no more and no less evil than any other glyph anywhere else, with no need to replace one with the other. To be good/evil, you must be sapient and able to tell the difference between good and evil. Said difference is a variable, not a constant.</p>
<p>In practice, there is also inertia. &lsquo;K&rsquo; is perfectly adequate, so why change? Same with the nagari glyph, U+0915. Why change what works when there is nothing (obvious) to gain?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">John, I think you are over-analysing the situation, and I don&rsquo;t think the complexities of differing religious viewpoints &ndash; even ignoring the likely high percentage of agnostics and atheists among British Linux tweeters &ndash; are especially relevant. The proposal here is to change a letter in a writing system, part of the cultural heritage of many millions of people, to a letter borrowed from another writing system, part of the cultural heritage of many millions of other people, because of an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unfounded<!-- raw HTML omitted --> belief that the letter prompts suicidal thoughts because of an association with the shape of the confluence of some rivers of which the majority of readers are unaware and which, if one looks at a map, the letter K doesn&rsquo;t actually look that much like.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@John Hudson:
It is true that, as far as I am aware, no other Hindus have felt the need to advocate reform of the Latin alphabet. Thus, even when A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada was alive, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back to Godhead<!-- raw HTML omitted --> magazine was typeset in plain old ordinary Times Roman with no alterations to the characters.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;over-analysis&rdquo;, though, had one specific purpose - to reach that one man. The issue about Hinduism being syncretistic has nothing to do with the alphabet reform <!-- raw HTML omitted -->per se<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it has to do with why the response to the proposal is so dismissive and even derisive.</p>
<p>Because it is true that it is natural in Hinduism to take the legends in the scriptures of non-Hindu religions more seriously than it is normal in Christianity to take the content of non-Christian faiths seriously. If he is aware of this cultural fact, then he will be less surprised at not being taken seriously, and less likely to attribute the disinterest he encounters to causes such as racism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are offtopic, please do not continue this thread here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weasel word racists?</p>
<p>I want to avoid being rude to him myself, but I do want him to somehow understand that the rationale he gives for his proposed reform will not appear to have any validity whatever to people here - and, thus, when he advances such a reform on such a rationale, and gives every appearance of expecting other people to take it seriously, he will be regarded as less than intelligent and less than rational.</p>
<p>It may be that a cultural factor is contributing to the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Incidentally, his use of a Sansqrit letter was because it was what he had handy, as a placeholder. But instead of designing a new letter, there is a much simpler way to achieve what he wishes.</p>
<p>Simply use the letter Q to replace the 11th letter of the alphabet. And where Q is currently used, replace QU by CW, which is a combination not in use. That way, there would be no cwestion about which words are intended. Of course, languages other than English might need a different spelling reform.</p>
<p>And where the letter Q is used in transliterations from Arabic or Persian, replace it by QQ. Thus, one might have &ldquo;When the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->baidaqq<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reaches the eighth rank, it is promoted to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->firzan<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;, or one might refer to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Qitāb shauqq al-mustahām fī ma&rsquo;rifat rumūz al-aqqlām<!-- raw HTML omitted --> written by Abu Baqr Ahmad.</p>
