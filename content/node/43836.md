body: "I saw this newspaper while in Berlin a while ago and thought the layout was
  very appealing and unconventional. It's distributed on a weekly basis, and the content
  is mainly politics (from a left wing perspective as far as I could understand).
  There's one typeface that is used throughout the newspaper, both in display and
  text, and at first glance I thought it was [[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&id2=roman|Dolly]].
  But it's less fluffy and has more serif in it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMalte\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/14-2008-titel1_5123.gif]"

    [[Luc(as) de Groot]]. Read more about it <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/expert_level#comment-257418\">in
    this thread</a> (a recent Type ID Quiz). By the way, the brush script nameplate
    has been designed by de Groot, too.\r\nF\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Amazing Florian. Thank you!\r\n\r\nIt was entertaining to read the ID-quiz
    on the exact same typeface. If only I had dared peeked inside I would have been
    able to give a hint at least. This typeface has been distracting my mind for quite
    some time now.. From what I understood of your comments in the quiz-thread, this
    font can't be licensed? Too bad.\r\n\r\n\u2013 <em>Malte</em>"
