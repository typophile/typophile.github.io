body: I have designed a logo, but used fonts from dafont.com.  How should I go about
  being able to use these fonts for logos without getting into trouble?  Do I just
  need to buy the font?  Also, will the company be able to Copywrite the logo I gave
  them If I used that font?  What do the other companies do when they make logos?  Please
  help me out.  Thanks.

    a Readme file in the folder. Read it! The restrictions vary. Some developers want
    $5, others just want to be notified... it varies. "

  body: So If I bought a whole font package, could I then use any of those fonts for
    any kind of logo I would want to design?

    them which prohibits usage in a logo you are in the clear.\r\n\r\n<em>Also, will
    the company be able to Copywrite the logo I gave them If I used that font?</em>\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n<em>What
    do the other companies do when they make logos?</em>\r\n\r\nSome companies you
    fonts out of the box. Some take those fonts and tweak them to suit. Some hand-letter
    their own. \r\n\r\nGenerally speaking there are very few fonts which you cannot
    use in logos and most of those are dingbat or picture fonts."
