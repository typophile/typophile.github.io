body: "Dear Typophile users,\r\nI am wondering if there is a way to set the text without
  the paragraph breaks (or returns) using pargraph marks instead (like a pilcrow or
  such - \xB6)  in an automatic way (without having to search and replace it with
  find and change in InDesign).\r\nIn that way making a solid block of text.\r\nHere
  is an example (<em>Symbol without indent or line break</em>):\r\nhttp://www.thinkingwithtype.com/contents/text/#Marking_Paragraphs\r\n\r\nI
  look for a similar thread but could not find it...\r\nSo any help to make it easier
  to achieve will be welcome.\r\nThanks in Advance"

  body: "Remember that for \"paragraphs\" over a certain number of characters -- pretty
    low, as I remember -- InDesign reverts to the single line composer mode.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    just search for end of paragraph & replace it with a space of some sort, a pilcrow,
    and another space.\r\n\r\nNot what you asked, but I don't see the issue of doing
    this globally. Then go back & put in whatever paragraphing you do want.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want it global & semiautomatic, just set up a grep search/style. However,
    at some point, you'll probably want an end of paragraph, so I'd advise against
    this."

  body: "The answer is there is no way to do this automatically \u2014 in real time
    \u2014 in InDesign. I.e., you can't do an on-the-fly search-and-replace to change
    hard returns to something else. A GREP style won't do it, and there's annoyingly
    no \"real time\" search-and-replace feature.\r\n\r\nFor one brief moment of hope,
    I thought AutoCorrect might help you out, but you can't enter a return as a character
    in AutoCorrect. Returns sort of have their own special rules."

    hard returns to something else</blockquote>\r\n\r\n???\r\nWe get in manuscripts
    all the time that use the following coding\r\n\r\n<blockquote>... sdfkjg azsdfkl
    aslkdf awelt asdfj asdrfkgj aslkj asdflkj aweotu awet aslkdfj asldfkj\r\n{A}\r\nThis
    is an A-subhead\r\n{txt} aweroptu aqtrwiu sdfkjg azsdfkl aslkdf awelt asdfj asdrfkgj
    aslkj asdflkj aweotu awet aslkdfj asldfkj</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOK. I want to apply
    paragraph styles globally. I first search for \r\n\r\n{A}\r\nand throw out the
    return, so it is on the same line a the text proper,  e.g.,\r\n\r\n{A}This is
    an A-subhead\r\n\r\nDone by searching for {A} & the special end of paragraph wildcard
    token, and replacing it with only {A}\r\n\r\nTo finish the story... I then search
    for the character {A} with a paragraph style  of \"text\" and replace the paragraph
    style with \"Ahead\".\r\n\r\nOne more search to dump the code {A}.\r\n\r\nAll
    done with \"find and replace,\" it takes very little time for a chapter (\"story\"
    in InDesign) or even an entire book (\"all\")\r\n\r\nBut the first step was knocking
    out that unwanted hard return, so the {A} code was in the same paragraph as the
    text of the subhead.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm home & haven't tested it exactly, I'm 99.44
    &% sure you can do that & replace the hard return with a pilcrow & spaces, using
    either \"selection\", \"story\", or \"all\" (\"all\" probably  not a smart choice...)\r\n"

  body: "Yes, of course you can do a search-and-replace.\r\n\r\nI said you can't do
    it \"on the fly\" \u2014 i.e., you can't set it up so every instance of a hard
    return <em>automatically</em> becomes a sequence of pilcrow surrounded by spaces
    every time it's typed, without actively executing a search and replace.\r\n\r\nIn
    other words, a GREP <em>search</em> will work, but a GREP <em>style</em> won't.\r\n\r\nThe
    original poster specifically asked if you can do this \"without having to search
    and replace it.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer is no, unfortunately you can't."
