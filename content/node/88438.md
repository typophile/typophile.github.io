  in three months. For this I would like to retrace the evolution of the reproduction
  of scripts in type, from the earliest days of metal type to feature-rich OpenType
  scripts. As I don't have any academic background in typography I would like to fact-check
  the earliest examples of scripts in metal type. I am not looking to be exhaustive,
  but want to have the key moments down.\r\n\r\nJohannes Gutenberg (c. 1398\u20131468)

  on scripts that are designed to look like (connected) handwriting, because this
  has to lead me to OpenType features that help simulate this.\r\n\r\nMistral, ingenious

    other way around: the Cancellaresca was based on the italics cut by Grifo. The
    first italic script was invented by Ludovico Vicentino de'll Arrighi, and published
    in the Operina, around 1527, also known as \"humanistica cursiva\" and later,
    in several countries like Spain and Portugal, was also known as Bastarda (bastard)
    because it was a deviation from its original (Grifo).\r\n\r\nHope this help.\r\nBest,\r\nDino"

    represents a formalisation of the humanist cursive hand. It's accurate to suggest
    that this was in response to the typographic italic, part of the flowering of
    fine writing in reaction to print publishing that occurred in the 16th Century
    in Italy and elsewhere, but incorrect to say that 'the first italic script' was
    invented by Arrighi and based on the Griffo italic types. Griffo's italic types
    -- and the Aldine pocket editions for which they were cut -- were inspired by
    contemporary informal copy books, written in the style classified by Michelle
    P. Brown as <em>littera humanistica corsiva libraria.</em> The specimen shown
    in Brown's book, <em>A guide to western historical scripts from antiquity to 1600,</em>
    is from 1483. Examples in the catalogue <em>Rome Reborn</em> are dated to the
    third quarter of the 15th Century.\r\n\r\nWhat Arrighi and the other writing masters
    of the 16th Century do is to take what had been a quickly written scholars' hand,
    relatively messy and inconsistent -- characteristics reflected in Griffo's types
    -- and restyle it as an elegant secretarial hand. As I say, this is part of the
    scribal reaction to print publishing: losing the copyist market to type, they
    improve the quality of their product, making writing a luxury item instead of
    a commodity. Arrighi then, in turn, translates his improved italic hand into type,
    and other printers base their italics on the hands of particular writing masters.
    [Mardersteig makes a convincing case, for example, that Marcolini's italic types
    are based on models provided by Francesco Alunno, probably the greatest calligrapher
    of his time.]"

  body: "Hello Yves,\r\nThe Civilt\xE9 type you mentioned is surely a crucial point
    in the development of modern script types; it is highly influent on the 'ronde'
    (or 'financi\xE8re') and other 'French' scripts popular well into the last century
    (they are usually upright, bearing some gothic component and suggesting the use
    of a rigid, truncated pen).\r\nThe work of Pierre Moreau, from the 1640s, is another
    milestone: it shows the influence of his contemporary calligraphic (and typographic)
    styles, namely the changes in the way the pen is cut (informed by Cresci) and
    the delicate thin strokes related to copperplate engraving; Moreau's hand is slow,
    round, 'engraved'. The so-called 'copperplate' or 'English' style (it will dominate
    the field of formal scripts up until no long ago) descends from that path, notably
    taking its mature shape in the hands of Thomas Cottrell, in the 1770s; according
    to Morison the same derivation applies to most of the other so-called 'round hands'.
    \r\nAnother notable fact is the introduction in the US of the 'circular scripts',
    in the second half of the 19th Century, some of whose reach a degree of informality
    never seen before (and hardly later, until Excoffon times). I think formality
    is the key to understand, analyze and describe script typefaces; this becomes
    more and more true from the 1930s, (the decade when the most exciting things happen
    in the field, in my opinion). \r\nThis is a bit of a quick comment, please get
    in touch if you need reference texts or anything else: I'm happy to help, if I
    can; and do forgive my Italo-English.\r\nBest,\r\nRiccardo"
