		<div class="commentbody">I was wondering about the stacking order; obviously it would be nice if the lists were alphabetical (by title?), but if books are on multiple lists this would require some scripting.

Any chance of a "Book Design" section? (Not strictly typography, but not quite Book Arts or Printing Arts.)

Also, perhaps a Magazines section listing currently published design magazines (<em>CA, Print,</em> etc.)?

Tiff, I'm home now and am brimming over with stuff to compile & send you. Get ready...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes the overlap is a result of being able to tag, sort of, in the previous version of Typophile Books.

We can definitely add a book design section.

Alphabetical by title would be good.

Magazines, another good idea.

- I'd like to remove overlap. If you see books that are overlapped, please point them out to me. (I'll look as well.) We'll vote on where they belong for real.
- I do want to add Book Design and Calligraphy/Lettering is a good idea too.
- If you see a book in one section and feel it belongs elsewhere please tell me. 
- Again, don't be afraid to point out errors. For instance, I realize that all of the books attached to Robin Kinross have the wrong publisher. (This will be fixed immediately.) 

Jason, you are a model citizen. Everyone please note how Jason sent me information to be added and follow in his noble footsteps.

<ol>Designing Type
by Karen Cheng
Publisher: Yale University Press; (April 3, 2006)
Paperback: 224 pages
ISBN: 0300111509
Price: $29.95 (list price)
http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509/sr=1-1/qid=1165538233/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-2314699-9678433?ie=UTF8&s=books
 
Jason Dewinetz: While I've read a few comments both positive & negative on this book, as a reader with no formal training in type design I've found the book very useful towards a better understanding of how digital glyphs are put together, based one on another, etc. A well produced & finely illustrated publication.</ol>

I realize there have been threads dedicated to horror of Amazon. Please consider that in this instance it is serving a very real and good purpose. When you purchase from Amazon you are doing a small part to support Typophile. So, consider if you are going to suggest a book please check to see if it is available on Amazon first. Then, if it isn't please do give the link for the other site. 

This could be a great resource for everyone looking for books. I hope you are all as enthusiastic about it and ready to participate! Go team!
