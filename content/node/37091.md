  body: "#1 - I like it. Very classy, but the fire adds some edge. Make sure you align
    things optically, not geometrically - The 'C' in CREATIONS should stick out a
    bit to the left of the 'B'. I'd tighten up the tracking in everything just a bit.
    I'm also worried that the diamond will get lost at small sizes, so you may have
    to play around with the scaling of the flames vs. the stone.\r\n\r\n#2 - Not really
    a logo. Think of how this would be reproduced in a one colour setting (such as
    a photocopy or fax). I think it's too cartoony as well, but depending on who the
    target market and what kind of price this jewellery has, it might be appropriate.\r\n\r\nOld
    logo - This guy might not know how to market himself properly... hopefully you
    can help him.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I think that #1 has very good potential to become a very nice logo. The major
    problem that I see with it is the difference between the fire and the the diamond.
    You'll have to make them more even so they don't look like two images glued together
    but as one image. A symbol of the whole logo. Fire stylization is very very likeable
    and nice...\r\n\r\nBuild on that. Make the diamond a bit bigger and bolder to
    complement the fire and you'll be closer to what you're looking for. Maybe the
    diamond should be the source of the fire? Or maybe vice a versa. Don't get distracted
    by the real fact..."

    jeweller, while fire and heat might be required to create jewellery they are not
    what most would think of, I would look at the product rather than the process
    to influence/dominate the mark. Obviously it is not necessary (or even possible)
    for a logo to represent everything about the person/organisation it is supposed
    to represent. \r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I'd go with the second one because the first one has those subtle lines that
    first of all need lots of refinements and second of all don't really add anything
    to the symbol.\r\n\r\nI'd choose the second one. Maybe even discarding the bottom
    part of the flame under the diamond. And refine the left most curve of the flame.
    Because it's oddly shaped."

  body: So I redrew the mark, and am pretty satisfied with it now, so on to the Typography.
    I originally thought about a more formal serif look, but I tried a less formal
    sans look as well. Along with a few placement variations, I am concern however
    about the mark replacing the O in Creations and not reproducing well at smaller
    sizes.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo4_4051.jpg]

    go with #2 without the rule. The only problem that #2 has is the join between
    J and A. I'd lift J to baseline and sort that out.\r\n\r\nIf you plan to go with
    the rule try placing the symbol so the top part of the diamond will align with
    the rule.\r\n\r\nYou're getting there. I hope you're also satisfied with your
    results so far..."

    that's why I didn't like it.\r\n\r\nI agree that the diamond should be aligned

    the bottom two.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo5_6103.jpg]"

    you didn't... they are visually still not aligned. Maybe I should point out to
    visually align those not geometrically. At least you didn't align #1, #2 and #3.\r\n\r\nBut
    I'd go with #1. Seems strong and clean. But align it. :)"

    to be able to see this as a vector rather than a low-res raster. I think you can
    attach pdfs to your original post if you edit it.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
