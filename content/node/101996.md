  body: Without too much thinking, I would say [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/futura-sh|Scangraphic
    Futura]] (to get the XLight weight). While checking, I came across [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/graphicus-dt|Graphicus
    Light]] which is very close too. Haven't noticed before Futura and Graphicus were
    such close.
