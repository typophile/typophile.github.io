  Latein & Ratio Kursiv</cite> \u2013 D.Stempel AG Frankfurt am Mein (1923). My problem
  is that I can\u2019t find an adequate amount of specimen \u2013 only a small sample
  in <cite>Deutsche schrift kunst</cite>. Any tip? Or where I might find the actual
  font?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nK.T.K M\xF6ller"

    find something there?

    I have found is $65 US. However, there are two copies avaliable at Amazon.com's
    <strong>German</strong> site for VERY LITTLE MONEY (one for less than \u20AC5,
    the other for \u20AC12), but amazon.de won't ship to the USA (they most likely
    will ship to Sweden).\r\n\r\n<em>If</em> you buy the book, then conclude your
    research and wish to sell it, let me know..."

    Are you sure you can't do it? You have to navigate through the language, and you
    have to pay shipping charges that (for me) ending up doubling the total price.
    But it worked.

    have depicted two samples of Ratio Latein drawn from a Stempel catalog dating
    back to the early 1950s. This catalog contains the complete typeface with Kursiv,
    Halbfette und Fette and with the complete character sets. I addition, I also have
    Ratio Latein samples from the later photo-composition era. However I have only
    a slow modem connection. Therefore I cannot upload high-resolution reproductions
    of these samples.\r\n"

    used as slug casting font, not as hand-composition font. As a slug or line-casting
    font, Ratio-Latein had identical alphabet-lengths of Roman/Italic/Bold, the variation
    of stroke (contrast between upstrokes and downstrokes) was mininal, and kerns
    (of letter f etc.) did not exist.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temp/ratio5a.gif\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temp/ratio5b.gif"
