  \"JUST\" part, but I think there must be a more suitable typeface out there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust
  communities is a non-profit organization, here is their vision and mission statements:\r\n\r\nVision:\r\nJust
  Communities envisions an equitable and inclusive network, where all people are connected,
  respected and valued.\r\n\r\nMission:\r\nJust Communities advances justice by building
  leadership, fostering change, and dismantling all forms of prejudice, discrimination
  and oppression.\r\n\r\nThank you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/justcommunitiesdraft_6482.jpg]"

    the roundness of the hand shapes.\r\nI would try to justify the text between \"JUST\"
    and \"communities\".\r\nAnd maybe also try a different round typeface."

  body: "The hands in the /S/ make it look too thin to my eyes (I think the effect
    becomes even more obvious/distracting in smaller sizes).\r\nMaybe you\u2019d find
    a way to give the /S/ a little more weight or else consider lightening J,U and
    T.\r\nUnless I\u2019m the only one here who thinks that /S/ is too thin."

    too found it too light compared to the other letters (and would have suggested
    to try some different solution to insert the hands in the wordmark).\r\nBut the
    request was just about the complementary typeface, so I didn\u2019t comment on
    the \"JUST\" part."

  body: "I'd make hands smaller to make S heavier. It's something that stroke me the
    first moment I saw it.\r\n\r\nBut otherwise it's quite hard to separate each combination
    because they are too close one to another. They could be 50% smaller and more
    apart.\r\n\r\nI don't like any either because they're misaligned or too close
    to JUST. Have you tried something scripty? YOu have hands, you have people, you
    have community. Maybe something in style of Ministry Script would work... I'd
    try that as well."

    on it :)\r\n\r\nBut I would like to know more about the accompanying typefaces,
    does anyone have any suggestions about what typeface would complement the JUST?"

    I'm using a sans-serif to accompany the font, but I'm still not sure about the
    choice.... [img:sites/default/files/old-images/just_4744.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank you

  body: I would try a rounded terminals typeface. Maybe slanted to match the S terminals
    (or T's and J's).

    kindness of two hands grasping towards each other. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the /J/U/T/
    can be in a thinner typeface or in lowercase?"
