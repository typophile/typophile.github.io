body: Hi, is it ok to make small caps iota (I) with the dot on top? I know it is not
  commonly used but is a distraction?

    of any iota with dot accent. Where do you saw it? This may be not a distraction
    but a less known diacritic combination. It would be interesting to know about
    it.\r\n\r\nAlso note iota is found in Latin, Greek and Cyrillic scripts, being
    a diferrent character in each one (with different Unicode codification)."

  body: "I know some display faces include design elements from lower-case letters
    in their upper case.\r\n\r\nSometimes it's traditional - an uppercase U that looks
    like an enlarged lowercase U is found in a number of oldstyle faces.\r\n\r\nOther
    times, one is dealing with faces that seek to obtain a unicase effect, analogous
    to the lowercase of Peignot, for example. But while that is \"OK\" in the sense
    of being accepted, it is also distracting - so it's done only in intentionally
    extravagant display faces.\r\n\r\nThink of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/jazz-gothic/|Jazz
    Gothic]] from Canada Type, for example."

    just look at the small caps and there it is an iota with dot. And it is not a
    display typeface so it''s really odd. '

    different letters.\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I]]\r\n\r\nIf
    you intend your font to support the Turkish language, you need both forms. If
    not, it would be very confusing to use the dot above I."
