  [[http://www.katranpress.com/stamps_about.html|postage stamps by type designers]],
  and there are a few names I'm sure how to pronounce. Would anyone be willing to
  offer advice on pronouncing the following?\r\n\r\nExcoffon (as in Roger)\r\nAndrzej
  Heidrich\r\nChwast (as in Seymour)\r\nPeignot (as in Peignot & Sons)\r\n\r\n\r\nMany

  body: "According to what German native speakers say, pronouncing the last syllable
    of \u2018Heidrich\u2019 as a rhyme for \u2018fish\u2019 comes closer to the original
    sound than making it rhyme with \u2018big\u2019 or \u2018sick\u2019. So, \u2018High-drish\u2019,
    stressed on the first syllable, should be okay. For \u2018Andrzej\u2019, I would
    suggest \u2018Unn-jay\u2019, the stressed first syllable rhyming with \u2018fun\u2019,
    the second with \u2018play\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe pronunciation of \u2018Excoffon\u2019
    can be transcribed as \u2018Ex-ko-f\xF5\u2019. \u2018Ex\u2019 is like \u2018specs\u2019,
    \u2018ko\u2019 may have vowel like \u2018blow\u2019, the vowel in the stressed
    last syllable should be nasalised as some Englishmen do in words like \u2018chanson\u2019.
    In \u2018Peignot\u2019, try to avoid using in a diphthong in the first syllable
    in favour of something like the first vowel of \u2018Pepita\u2019; the second
    syllable is like a British pronunciation of \u2018new\u2019 with a vowel of the
    \u2018blow\u2019 type, i.&thinsp;e. \u2018Pe-nyow\u2019."

  body: "Seymour Chwast is American, so Chwast is pronounced KW\xC4ST as [[http://www.loc.gov/nls/other/sayhow.html|the
    NLS pronunciation guide]] has it or /kw\u0251\u02D0st/ in IPA (in the NLS transcription,
    \xE4 represents the vowel of PALM).\r\n\r\nHeidrich would be pronounced /\u02C8xeidrix/
    according to Polish pronunciation rules, although I don't know if Poles would
    imitate the German pronunciation for the non-native sequence 'ei'. HAY-drick would
    be an acceptable anglicization, or HIGH-drick if the Poles indeed imitate German
    pronunciation for the vowels.\r\n\r\nFor Andrzej (/\u02C8and\u0290ej/ in Polish),
    \xC4ND-zhey would indeed be the closest to the original pronunciation, but \xC4ND-ray
    (= anglicized pronunciation of Andr\xE9) is also close enough in my opinion and
    is in fact the only anglicization I've heard for this Polish name.\r\n\r\nExcoffon
    (/\u025Bksk\u0254f\u0254\u0303/ in French) would be ex-caw-FAWN following the
    usual method of pronouncing French names for American English. Likewise, pay-NYO
    is usual for Peignot."

    the name of a Pole, though, and even if Poles imitate the German vowels for Heidrich,
    I doubt they use the German ich-Laut /\xE7/ for the final consonant. They use
    a sound identical to the German ach-Laut /x/, which doesn't sound anything like
    'sh' in English. In any case, as in Zurich, the usual anglicization of the German
    ich-Laut is also 'k'.\r\n\r\nIf you can pronounce the names with sounds not normally
    used in English, like the ach-Laut or nasalized vowels in French, that's fine,
    but it is perfectly acceptable (and arguably desirable) to replace those sounds
    with English near-equivalents when saying these names in an English context."

  body: "You\u2019re certainly right, Jongseong, saying that Poles do not use the
    German \u2018Ich-Laut\u2019 when pronouncing Heidrich\u2019s name. I just wanted
    to make a point in favour of using the final consonant of \u2018fish\u2019 when
    rendering the German sound in English&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;although this may have
    been less than relevant in the present case. The \u2018sh\u2019 sound permits
    to come a bit closer to the original consonant and may not sound all too strange
    in rare names; the established anglicisation should, of course, be used if there
    is one.\r\n\r\nWhether the German and Polish \u2018ach\u2019 sound or the nasalised
    \u2018o\u2019 is perceived as difficult to pronounce depends on the variety of
    English you\u2019ve grown up with. Given that KatRanPress seems to be neither
    a Scotsman nor a Brit, your suggestions may work best. Apologies for any incorrect
    information!"
