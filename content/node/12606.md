body: "<strong> [[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Fit </strong>\r\n\r\nThe \"fit\" of
  a font describes how the individual letters fit together alongside each other. A
  <em>loosely</em> fitted font has relatively large gaps between the individual letters;
  a <em>closely</em> fitted font has narrow gaps. The fit of a font makes quite a
  substantial difference to its general appearance.<!--break-->\r\n\r\nWhen type was,
  one way or another, little metal blocks, with each letter placed on its block (save
  in the few cases where there was a [[Kern|kern]]) fitting was a matter of adjusting
  the amount of spare metal to the left and right of the actual letter (the [[Sidebearing|sidebearing]]).
  Only rarely, through the use of [[Ligatures|ligatures]], did the designer adjust
  the space between particular pairs of letters.\r\n\r\nWith digital typography, getting
  the side bearings \"right\" remains important; but it is also possible to make small
  adjustments for particular pairs of letters to move them a little closer or a little
  further apart than their sidebearings would indicate. This requires a careful eye
  and good judgment: it can easily be overdone.\r\n\r\nFit is also often adjusted
  by a designer if s/he is making a font for use at a particularly small size or large
  size: generally speaking fonts designed for smaller sizes have been more loosely
  fitted, and fonts designed for larger sizes have been more tightly fitted.\r\n\r\nIt
  was always possible to make manual adjustments to fit: tiny spaces could be inserted
  to make the fit looser; type could be filed down to make it tighter. But in practice
  the labour involved made this practical only for short texts in long sizes. Software
  makes it relatively easy for everyone to fiddle to their own satisfaction--but it
  is commonly held that since fitting is a difficult art, it is in most cases (and
  in all cases of doubt) best left to the designer. Opinions differ on whether \"automated\"
  fitting by software (such as InDesign's optical spacing feature) improves fit: it
  probably depends on the font, whether it was well-fitted to start with, and the
  particular task.\r\n\r\nThere is a classic discussion of the difficulties of fitting
  in Tracy's <cite>Letters of Credit</cite>"
