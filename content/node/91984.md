  in typography.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if you can recommend a good free font for
  subtitling commercial DVD's and possibly Blu-rays. The thing is, there is a new
  independent DVD distributor in my country and they started releasing indie films
  along with some classics like Bergman and Kurosawa. The only problem is they use
  the most hideous Arial look-alike set in bold and a ridiculously large size for
  the subtitles, so I was planning on contacting them with some suggestions for free
  fonts they could use instead. I know I'm probably battling windmills but I just
  have to try it."

  body: Thanks, Cinecav looks quite good. But I doubt that they will change it even
    if it's free, much less commercial.
