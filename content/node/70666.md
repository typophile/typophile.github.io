  Script/Fraktur guide, but couldn\u2019t find it. I can\u2019t remember where I found
  it, but it has been sitting in the corner of my desktop for some time now awaiting
  an identification.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uncial_4439.png]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I can't find it either, but it seems like an adaptation (re-drawing) based
    on <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/colmcille-mt/\">Colmcille</a>,
    maybe using the l.c. 'n' enlarged.\r\n\r\nThat's the most similar Irish style
    I could find. A foundry called Evertype seems to specialize in Irish/Gaelic lettering
    (at MyFonts), but while some had similar letters, none seemed to match very closely
    with your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
