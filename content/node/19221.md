body: "Hi there!! : )\r\n\r\nI'd like your opinions (always valuable) on this new
  typeface FH After. It's still on development... I would say more on a finalization/fine
  tuning design step of the process.\r\n\r\nMy main objective is to create a very
  distinctive display, with an \"international style\" quality. To be used by innovative
  companies, no matter where...\r\n\r\nIt's design also provide some nice experimentation
  on some daring ligatures that I wish to work on a little deep.\r\n\r\nAnyway, what's
  your point of view??\r\n\r\ncheck out at:\r\nwww.focodesign.art.br/others/After_01.pdf\r\nwww.focodesign.art.br/others/After_02.pdf\r\n\r\nMany
  regards from sunny brazil!!!\r\n\r\nFabio Haag"

  body: "I like it very much! Looks good.\r\nBut on a first looks it seems to me that
    some charkters may be a little bit too wide. The B h and 9\r\nI think the r doesnt
    work.\r\nAnd enable ligatures in your mapa de caracteres. I dont know how normal
    S, T, s and t look.\r\n\r\nSteven"

  body: "It's got a lot of character, in a good way!\r\n\r\nGetting the spacing seems
    difficult, it may indeed help to make some of the characters narrower.\r\n\r\nThe
    gamma-like r is a bit odd, but I'd be reluctant to normalize it too much.  I don't
    like the clockwise @-sign. It's extremely bulky and self-conscious. Also, consider
    getting rid of the serif-like protrusion on the stem of the \xDF, it seems out
    of place in this typeface."
