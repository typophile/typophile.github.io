body: I&#39;m trying to find a definitive answer as to when you have to use the trademark
  symbol. I have always thought that you used the trademark symbol the first time
  a term appeared in context. Every other occurence of that word within the rest of
  the document did not need to carry the symbol, as it was covered by the first use.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve recently picked up a client who has every occurence of thier trademark
  terms identified on every document. This is a visual nightmare, as you can immagine,
  and I would like to change this. I have been trying to find some actual literature
  regarding the proper use however I haven&#39;t found anything online, nor in my
  handy Bringhurst book. <BR> <BR>Is there an actual rule? If so, what is it? Is there
  a book or official online document I could refer to?

  body: John -- <BR> <BR>The trademark symbol &#40;&#153;&#41; is used to indicate
    a mark which a company considers to be a unique trademark, whether registered
    or not. The TM symbol has no legal significance, but only serves to notify the
    public that the mark owner views the mark as a protectable trademark. The circle-R
    &#40;&#174;&#41; mark is used when the trademark has been duly registered with
    the appropriate government office. In the U.S. this is the <a href="http://www.uspto.org"
    target="_blank"> Patent and Trademark Office</a>. &#42; <BR> <BR>The circle-R
    symbol should be used systematically to identify a registered mark when using
    it to promote a product or service, in order to secure maximum legal protection.
    I take this to mean primarily advertising and packaging. This does not necessarily
    apply to running text which makes editorial mention of trademarks. <BR> <BR>As
    far as when/how it is used outside of ads and packaging, that is usually a matter
    of editorial style. The Chicago Manual of Style declares that the symbols are
    not necessary in running text. Some other house styles that I&#39;m aware of tend
    to follow your example of using it for the first instance only. <BR> <BR>The TM
    had no legal standing, so using it for <i>every</i> occurrence serves no real
    purpose.  <BR> <BR>HTH <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR> <BR>&#42; My information comes from
    <i>Patent, Copyright, &amp; Trademark</i> by Stephen Elias &#40;Nolo Press&#41;.

  body: I used to work for a man who insisted on me using &#34;SM&#34; &#40;Service
    Mark&#41; with every appearance of his &#40;I&#39;m sure unregistered&#41; logo,
    in addition to every time the name of one of his products was referenced. <BR>
    <BR>I had assumed that &#34;SM&#34; was only used  when representing a product
    or service name &#40;almost like the &#34;d.b.a.&#34; of the product/service world&#41;,
    but not with a logo device. Of course, being my employer, I did whatever he asked
