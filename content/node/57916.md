  design, but when it comes to my own pieces I am hitting a brick wall. I have designed
  a couple of versions of cards for my studio but I am not happy with them so far.
  Just curious to know if you all have gone through this as well. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nd

    lean toward minimalism which makes it rather easy for me to default to Univers
    in two colors on a grid. For my new foundry I\u2019ve decided to just dump a static
    identity; instead I\u2019ll be cycling through monograms and my own fonts as I
    get around to them. Far more interesting that way."

  body: "I have been putting the new cards off for too long. And then I can't commit
    to the designs I have done. I am my own worst client. And the cost of them is
    really setting me back. I wanted laser cutting and thermo ink plus 3 over 4 colour.
    Maybe a I should let other designers choose my stationery for me?\r\n\r\nd a n"

    over my car and after months I still can't come up with a tasteful and effective
    design.

  body: "well, I was kidding cuttlefish.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm nearing the end of re-doing
    my own, and it is tough. I'm the very worst client I ever hope to have. \r\n\r\nJust
    keep plugging a way is the only advice I'd have on the subject. \r\n\r\nI've designed
    dozens of different versions, the let them be for a week or so, culled them down
    to a handfull, revised those, got opinons from my wife, then picked one design,
    sat on it for a few more days, found I didn't hate it, and that it sort of says
    what I want it to - and that's that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

  body: I hate designing for myself, it's so difficult. Last round was about three
    years ago, and I don't like it anymore (not that I was 100 % happy even then).
    Now I've given up landline, so I need new calling cards. Maybe it's time for another
    redesign [sigh].
