  body: "Considering they're both next to vertical stems, I think they would be better
    Helvetica-like.\r\nThat should make easier to space \"true\" too.\r\nAlso I would
    try to loose a bit the vertical spacing too."

  body: To me the type is a bit of a mess. I see random cuts to most of the letters
    and none of it lends any flow. The curved cut on the 'g' is especially unsettling
    to me. It looks like you started with Arial which isn't the most solid ground
    from which to start.

    looks a little sat-upon.

    so clustered and compact, I and the type need some breathing room ."

    stopwatch would become an issue.\r\n\r\nAs for the meaning of the compass and

    (Where the company started). I know he and his partner like the compass idea so
    I would have to sell them pretty hard on something else. I'll try harder to think
    about it outside the box."

    compass is more of a star. Looking more like a star could definitely be a plus
    too, like the company produces stars lol. it'd be a very subtle subconscious design
    element, maybe."

  body: In land navigation, a bearing is the angle between a line connecting two points
    and a north-south line, or meridian.[1]. Bearings can be measured in two systems,
    Mils and Degrees.

    you've got a good start and a few interesting design directions to choose from.
    I also think you should develop and sell the compass mark by itself instead of
    clumsily trying to lock it in with some random typeface. Choose a typeface later
    when a mark has been decided on."

    any case do make sure you know the story behind that logo. It was designed by
    one logo designer for another, and latter happened to be a fraud and made a big
    fuss when he got caught. I am sure the ripples from that incident will eventually
    subside, but there is still a plenty of people in the logo design community who
    react nervously to that logo. This is in part why I remembered the logo in the
    first place."

    what I understand, the logo was used by a designer that would steal stock art
    and make logos from them. Is that the story?\r\n\r\nI had never seen that logo
    until you showed me. Is mine that similar? The lines are not at 90 degrees nor
    is there an inner arrow. Those are 3 pieces of a compass rose that I illustrated
    myself, inspired by the art shared by \"ishbog\" above.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes the type
    is Alte Haas. I love the rounded corners so much. There is a company called Fido
    that does all of their promotional pieces with this style of type. I'm not sure
    if it is Alte Haas exactly. \r\n\r\nCan you suggest a type like this one that
    is bit more unique?"

  body: "> Can you suggest a type like this one that is bit more unique?\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    have a look at <a href=http://www.paragraph.com.au/mentone.html>Mentone</a>? Alternatively,
    and I realize it's a heresy, you can take any font and simply add a stroke around
    it with rounded joints.\r\n\r\nBTW I know of Fido and I really really like their
    slightly rounded font. I am too not sure if it's Alte Haas. It looks like it,
    but given the size of Fido I think they are more likely to commission the replica
    than to use an (effectively) abandoned font.\r\n\r\n(edit)\r\n\r\nHere's what
    I meant by adding a stroke to round the type. Top is Alright Sans Medium, bottom
    is Alright Sans Regular padded with stroke with rounded corners. You can see some
    distortion in letterforms, especially in /r/ and /e/, but it is not <em>that</em>
    bad.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/truebearing_5672.png]"
