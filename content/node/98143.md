  They've been on the market since 2009 and at the time, they created a logo using
  VAG Rounded. The logo is still the same today... Five lowercase black letters in
  VAG Rounded regular, nothing else.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know your opinion about this
  font. Do you find it efficient, fresh, or outdated?\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/vag-rounded/\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    VAG is way too dated. It's a tech company, not a torn-jeans company.\r\n\r\nIf
    there's hope to get them to switch I'm sure people can recommend contemporary
    rounded fonts - that would serve as a form of continuity.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    that used Vag rounded as a branding font and it was as unusual as it was fresh
    and friendly. They produced some sort of portable Seattle traffic monitoring gadget.
    I remember being blown away by how well Vag worked for their purpose as the choice
    was really quite odd. In fact, it was so impressive that I redrew the numbers
    and promptly <a href=\"http://dribbble.com/shots/149595-Hamachi\">used them</a>
    in my own app (whether it was appropriate is another question :)).\r\n\r\nBut
    in the next few years lots and lots of people started using rounded fonts, including
    Vag and Omnes, and that diluted their value. Right now I'd say it might still
    be appropriate to use (heavily) rounded font for a tech logo, but only in specific
    cases (like a cutesy game development a'la Glitch). They are just too friendly,
    and so they frequently pass as artificial and fake.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong
    with rounded fonts in high-tech application, it's a great way to humanize the
    brand, but round it too much and there's a good chance to overdo it. \r\n\r\nPS.
    A good example of measured rounding is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/geogrotesque/\">Geogrotesque</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
