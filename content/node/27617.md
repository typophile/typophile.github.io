body: "Just exited the \"Demystifying Font Management\" panel discussion, grabbed
  a bite at Finagle a Bagel (lame name, blah sandwich), and I have to sit down and
  post my off-the-cuff comments.\r\n\r\nObservations: \r\n1- When staging a panel
  discussion, prepare the panel members ahead of time for the pointed, astute comments
  from David Berlow (Font Bureau).\r\n\r\n2- When asking a question to the panel,
  make sure Bruno isn't in within arm's reach of the microphone. (Herr Steinert, I'm
  only teasing.) =)\r\n\r\nThoughts:\r\nThe panel was fine and the technical questions
  were answered well, and some of the main issues of font management addressed. What
  bothered me was the almost nonchalant approach to the subject that the 3 font management
  reps and the Apple rep brought. Instead of hearing the pain points of a broad base
  of users and taking that back to their product teams as market research, they just
  said, \"font management has to be sucky\" and \"it's the user's responsibility to
  know their libraries, know what's compatible and troubleshoot our own glitches.\r\n\r\nIt
  was akin to telling the airline industry that they have a major problem with customer
  service and them saying back, \"I feel your pain, but air travel just has to suck,
  so deal.\"\r\n\r\nThe future:\r\nI'm honestly really excited about Linotype's Font
  Explorer app. It follows an entirely different business model, akin to iTunes where
  the app is free. (Does anybody remember paying for SoundJam?) The reason it's a
  viable business for Apple is because people use it to explore music and buy new
  tunes. The trick for Linotype to pull off is to setup a licensing model that taps
  into non-Linotype libraries. Who knows, maybe Linotype can justify the software
  dev costs simply through increased Linotype sales, and not have to worry about hooking
  in other foundries'.\r\n\r\nOther thoughts from attendees and non?"
