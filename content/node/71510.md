body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Germanica_4204.png]\r\nI have made a new
  blackletter type, called Germanica, based mainly on that of Fust and Sch\xF6ffer
  (c. 1457). The font includes a number of ligatures and scribal abbreviations. It\u2019s
  an Opentype font, and it can be downloaded (free of charge) from www.iol.ie/~sob/clonna.html."

  body: "Great typeface! Thank you! \r\nPerhaps you or anybody else know about any
    glyphs with diacritical marks or ligatures and what languages beside German and
    Latvian used blackletter in newspapers and book publishing in 20th century. \r\nI
    am trying to properly digitize Rudolf Koch's \"Kochschrift\" or as it appears
    on several places on the web as \"Deutsche Schrift\" (all these versions are just
    scanned and traced without any language support or ligatures)\r\nFor example in
    Latvia blackletter was used in book publishing and press well into nineteen thirties
    and had slightly different orthography as was used later after change to Latin
    type. Instead of commaaccent g, k, l, n and r were crossed with slash, longs was
    used for the sound of \"z\" even at the end of the word, but for the \"s\" in
    the middle of the word was used longs with a slash. \r\nYet unfinished version
    of the typeface I'm working on you san see here: http://lamatasunslazdi.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/Typefaces/G0000ZSHRmaOGNFA/I0000oZtWzqzCRnE"

  body: As I already said in the other thred (http://typophile.com/node/71511), regarding
    diacritics, the dot of the "i"s resemble an inverted breve (http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/020b/index.htm)
    or a circumflex.

  body: "\"You surely know that these Latvian characters have been added to Unicode
    recently \u2013?\"\r\nIf you want to do it correctly you can use gklnr with a
    slash INSTEAD of commaaccent in the same places. About long s with a slash - no
    it is not in unicode, but if you want to type historical texts correctly you have
    to figure out a way how to do it. I wrote a stylistic set for old Latvian where
    slash longs substitutes for longsslash. "
