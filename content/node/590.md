  <BR> <BR>Which font would you advice me? <BR>&#40;I tried Officina Sans, but I found

    been using it since &#39;94 for a lot of my rendered on-screen text, and it&#39;s
    fabulous. As a bonus, at large sizes it contains a lot of visual interest, maintaining
    stylistic consistency with the small text. <BR> <BR>---- <BR> <BR>If you need
    to make very small legible text, Rotis &#40;specifically the darkest weight of
    the Sans - which you might actually try to add a fake bold to as well&#41; is
    in a class of its own &#40;maybe surprisingly so&#41;, not least thanks to its
    economical narrowness.  <A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/rotis_12.gif"

  body: ' Laudatio and Rotis both have low contrast, which helps. Also, the former
    has a huge x-height &#40;which is great as long as the text is both small and
    short&#41;, while the latter has a narrowness which can often save the day. Laudatio
    &#40;and Avenir&#41; might benefit from some extra tracking. <BR> <BR>David, could
    you please put up a 13/14 of Avenir? I&#39;m getting a good feeling about it.
