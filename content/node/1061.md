  body: 'If I had to live with just one typeface, I&#39;d pick one that would work
    well as a text face at most sizes, especially small. It&#39;s easier to make a
    text face work as a display face than to make a display face work as a text face.
    As such, most sans serifs would be ruled out, although a few might be in the running,
    like Gill Sans, Syntax, Scala Sans, Myriad, and the like. <BR> <BR>If we&#39;re
    allowing the whole typeface family, I wouldn&#39;t worry so much about having
    an extensive range. The old masters made do quite nicely with roman, italic and
    bold. Instead, I&#39;d focus on beauty, legibility, readability and timelessness.
    <BR> <BR>My choices would likely boil down to one of: <BR> <BR>a. AGFA-Monotype
    or Linotype Plantin: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/plantin/"

    <BR> <BR> <BR>My final choice would probably be either Plantin or Cloister. If

  body: Not to divert the subject back to the orignal question, because I find this
    side note Gill&#39;s life interesting in a disturbing way.  But, in school we
    had a similar challenge.  We had to  choose 1 typeface and use it on the table
    of contents page for an international design magazine&#40;1960&#39;s era Graphis&#41;
    &#40;index, articles, 3 laungages, side notes, publisher information, subscrition
    information...etc&#41;  The idea being to take one face and build the appropriate
    heirarchy and maintain readability.  I chose Futura because of it&#39;s extensice
    family and legibility in both large, small and text sizes. It is clean, modern
    and geometric in nature. and for the most part sterotypically void . It was a
    fun &amp; challenging when your so used to having 100&#39;s of fonts to choose
    from on a daily basis. <BR>Futura

    I have to deplore the choice of Stempel Garamond - that zero. <BR>I stayed at
    Capel-y-ffin for a long weekend in the 80&#39;s and although not quite a hostel
    it was quite spartan, good for pony treks and a very pleasant pub, a decent walk
