body: "I know I just said this in another thread, but I thought it deserved its own
  discussion.\r\n\r\nSometimes one sees runaway italics in a message thread, where
  somebody forgets to close a \"cite\" or \"em\" tag and then all the rest of the
  thread ends up in italics. This happens because from an HTML point of view, it's
  one continuous block of HTML, so the unclosed tag \"infects\" the rest of the thread.\r\n\r\nBut
  the good news is that for the same reason, any subsequent poster can stop the run
  of italics in their message! Just start your message with closing \"cite\" and \"em\"
  tags with no opening, and all should be well. I've used this successfully on several
  occasions now.\r\n\r\nThis public service announcement is brought to you by the
  letter \"C\" and the number \"5.\"\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: actually, i prefer either 1) notifying the offending poster, and ask them
    to close the tag 2) notifying a moderator, and asking them to close the tag or
    3) both.

  body: Is there a bug with use of cite tags spanning multiple lines of text or with
    multiple cite tags in a single message? I seem to generate two or three bad posts
    a week with cite tags, but I'm previewing and checking all of my posts and at
    this point I don't think it's (usually) a problem on my end.

  body: I find cite tags get awkward on places like this, which is why I've given
    up using them. (FWIW, when I want to emphasize something, I crank out two em tags,
    purposefully close the second, and ensure I'm typing between them.)

  body: "I don't understand it either. I've gotten notified about it twice now, and
    neither time did I have open tags. I mean, I seriously don't believe that I left
    any open. I might have, but as a rule, any time I use any kind of tagging, I preview
    before I post.\r\n\r\nIt just doesn't make sense."

  body: it probably has to do with the "smarty pants" replacing returns with breaking
    returns. if you use a cite tag to open, always use a cite tag to close before
    you hit the enter key.
