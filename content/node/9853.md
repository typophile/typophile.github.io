    the answer. I have used the Multiple Master facility, and I can say that it does
    make appropriate kerning pairs when generating an instance.

    the Multiple Master font&#34;, right? well now I need to read about &#34;Name

    and then import it into the blended one. &#40;Assuming your two source fonts have
    identical kerning.&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Does the MM method account for extrapolation? I&#39;ve never even touched
    the MM features in FL, after all these years ... <BR> <BR>That&#39;s one thing
    I discovered just recently, that FL won&#39;t interpolate kerns. Fontographer
    actually did do this, surprisingly enough, but I think there were some unpredictable
    results if the two fonts didn&#39;t have the exact same pairs defined.

    Great. However, I face just one problem: I installed the font, but the font isn&#39;t
    available - mostly with Adobe app., - such as Illustrator, After Effects; I don&#39;t
    have a problem with FCP HD/Live Type, Motion, Freehand. Any idea why?'

    <BR> <BR>From what you have said, I&#39;ll assume you are using OS X. You may
    need to clear your font caches using Font Cache Cleaner or Font Finagler and restarting.
    Also, what kind of font are you generating?'

    <BR>Kerning works in FCP/Live Type, but not in Illustrator and Freehand, <BR>
    <BR>or... <BR> <BR>Kerning works in all of these, but in Illustrator and Freehand
    it makes the kerned pairs move apart instead, <BR> <BR>or...? <BR> <BR>In general,
    I would suggest checking the kerning pairs in the generated &#34;single master&#34;
    font.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s also possible, if you&#39;ve been generating and testing
    the same font repeatedly, that Illustrator, for example, may be confused because
    it &#34;remembers&#34; the earlier version of the font. <BR> <BR>If this is the
    case, you can force Illustrator to &#34;forget&#34; about the font by doing this:
    <BR> <BR>1. Quit Illustrator. <BR>2. Uninstall the font. <BR>3. Start Illustrator,
    then quit Illustrator. <BR>4. Install the font again. <BR> <BR>Now when you start
    Illustrator again, it will treat the font as if was new. If this was what was
    causing the problem, it should fix it. If you still have the problem, then it&#39;s
    something else. <BR> <BR>&#40;As an added measure, you may want to clear your
    system font caches between steps 2 and 3. I don&#39;t think this is absolutely
    necessary, though it may help.&#41; <BR> <BR>Freehand may respond to similar therapy,
    but I don&#39;t currently have it installed, so I haven&#39;t tested it and don&#39;t
    know if the diagnosis would even be the same. Could be, though.'

    <BR>When installing the first new font &#40;generated as Type 1, single master&#41;
    the font didn&#39;t show up in the font menu in Illustrator, After Effects. However,
    with Freehand, Motion, FCP HD/Live Type - the font showed up in the alphabetical
    order. The day after, the font showed up with all applications, but with Illustrator
    and After Effects - at the bottom of the list. <BR> <BR>By kerning issue/problem
    I do mean that the letters are too apart with some applications, and with others
    - not. <BR> <BR>After reading your last post I tried a couple of things: <BR>
    <BR>1. I generated another font &#40;Type 1, single master&#41; - this time the
    font showed up with all applications - in the alphabetical order, but still the
    kerning issue remains. <BR> <BR>2. I generated just &#34;plain&#34; Type 1 &#40;another
    new font, and not using the Blend mode - MM&#41; and had the same problem as described
    above. <BR> <BR>3. I generated another new font as Open Type&#40;PS&#41;, and
    this time the kerning issue with Illustrator disappeared. Freehand remains with
    the kerning issue as before. Motion - the kerning working fine. FCP HD/Live Type
    - the kerning issue remains the same. <BR> <BR>In each case I installed the font
    only one time!!! After facing this problem I didn&#39;t remove the font and install
    it again. <BR>In each case I installed a new different font. <BR> <BR>any ideas?'

  body: I&#39;m still trying to understand your description of the problem.  <BR>
    <BR>When you say &#34;letters are too far apart&#34; do you mean that the kerning
    is not being recognized at all? In other words, it&#39;s the same as if you turned
    kerning off?  <BR> <BR>Or, do you mean that, with kerning on, the letters are
    farther apart than the default spacing &#40;i.e., with the kerning turned off&#41;?
    That with kerning on, the letters move farther apart than with kerning off? <BR>
    <BR>Also, it might help if you could upload some screen snapshots showing how
    it looks in different applications.
