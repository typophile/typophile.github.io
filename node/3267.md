  body: Couldn&#39;t resist. The H font is utterly lacking in confidence and mystery
    &#40;I don&#39;t care what people say, helvetica is beautiful. Souless and beautiful&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>How about the Shire Types? <BR>Varying degrees of wit, mystery and masculinity.
    <BR>But all confident and beautiful. &#40;<a href="http://www.typography.net"
