		<div class="commentbody">hi tim <BR> <BR>i like it, but i think there is something strange in the contrast in the AU in MAUI. in someway i think that two thick strokes don't work very well together, even though i am not sure that it will work better if you flip your M and A, i think that you should try that. <BR> <BR>In &quot;Cruisers&quot; i think that you should work with two different &quot;s&quot;, just to take away the spirit of a script typeface and give it a look like manual script. <BR> <BR>i dont know if i was clear in my observations, but anyway, i hope that they are usefull <BR> <BR>CG</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I vote no on the flipage and the fake small caps. 2A is better. <BR>Tim, did you hand draw the Maui Mountain or modify an existing font? (Guessing the latter) <BR> <BR>&lt;putting_on_sherlock_holmes_hat&gt; <BR>The reason I say that is from looking at the A. The thin stroke looks overly thin. That is because it used to have a cross bar and the thin got thinned even more to compensate. Now that it's gone, the thin needs some weight back. Make it look the same as the thin on the N. Also check the thick stroke. They may have been shaved too (hard to tell at this resolution). BTW since the M = A+A that will need fixing too. <BR> <BR>The O might want more space in the middle (too dark). Instead of straight sides, try an oval made of 4 points. <BR> <BR>Script: This will need fixing in three places. 1. The Cr connection isn't smooth and could maybe use a bit more weight, 2. se spacing combination is too tight. You may want to draw a custom connection between them wrapping the s a little tighter and connecting it to the e. 3 er connection changes weight too quickly. <BR> <BR>Randy <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

It's causing the whole logo to lack cohesiveness (possibly because of the cap C?). I think that's what you were trying to solve in #3 above. What about trying a lower case c? Try a bunch of other layouts to solve this issue. <BR> <BR>You're getting close. <BR> <BR><i>Do you mean the radius of finishing loop &ndash; so it <BR>comes in a little lower to be able to connect it to the &quot;e&quot;?</i> <BR>Yes.</div>

It messes with the eyes in a negative way. <BR> <BR>The connection of the letters s&gt;e is too tight and seems like there could be a smoother transition from letter to letter. The s seems a little tall (in the altogether and in the loop), which could explain why the transition from s to e seems forced. And the r seems a little short. The connection from C to r seems to have a bump in it too. <BR> <BR>I really like the direction you have taken this, however I wonder if the word &quot;Cruisers&quot; could be a little more extended? Looser. Same style, but more of a scrawl or rather stretched across the bottom of the word &quot;Mountain&quot;?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Tiffany &amp; Scott, <BR> <BR>I tend to agree with you here. The slanted peaks do trick the eye in a negative way. I think it <i>may</i> be best to leave them be and have some fun with &quot;Cruisers.&quot; <BR> <BR> <BR>CAN I ASSUME THAT WE'RE IN AGREEMENT ABOUT 10.74 in terms of &quot;M&quot; weight and &quot;A&quot; wedge? (See my posts #103/104) <BR> <BR> <BR>Tiffany &ndash; I haven't had a chance to fix the script connections yet and am aware or the C-r, s-e, e-r issues. I agree that some fiddling with the placement, angle, and kerning could liven the word up as well as the overall contrast. <BR> <BR>Scott &ndash; Hmmm, I like what you've done with the peaks by leaving them flat, but wonder if there's still not too much optical trickery occuring, which tends to distract. I'll have to look at this more closely. I like the cruisers on an arc or at least on more of an angle concept and pushed right. I'm gonna play around with it a bit. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR> -t</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think it is legible. You need something clean to contrast against something rough in this case. Keep Cruisers clean. Also, I think it has too many tiers (the mountain, the &quot;maui&quot;, the &quot;mountain&quot;, and &quot;cruisers&quot;). If you are going to do something decorative like the volcano-mountain then don't add another element with &quot;cruisers&quot;.  <BR> <BR>Going back to Scott's idea: I think he has a good idea with the &quot;maui&quot; and &quot;mountain&quot; part, but I don't like the cruisers placement.

		<div class="commentbody">aaa well - like I said I just wanted to play with it a bit to show some overlapping and how the white contour can solve a bunch of space problems.  <BR> <BR>- its by no means *that* thought out. The upcurl or course is way too similar to the C but I had suggested way back that things could be center justified with that triangular base. something needs to 'end' it so to speak. perhaps just thinner and not so long. I donno. <BR> <BR>the roughness thing was only because I exported paths of of Tim's .gif image and didn't bother simplifying them. I thought after that it might have been apropos for style&hellip;because honestly I don't see the relation of a danty, girly, script face with these freakish people who fall 38miles peddle-free. I'm sure the &quot;cruisers&quot; aren't that elegant. hehe <BR> <BR>but anyway if this visual sparks an idea then great. Its sometimes hard to explain things in words.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><b>MAUI MOUNTAIN CRUISERS Redux</b> <BR> <BR>Firstly, my apologies for falling off there &ndash; but I was past deadlines and had to move on to other aspects of what was a larger project. <BR> <BR>I wanted to be sure and post the final logo and thank everyone involved for their excellent eyes, critiques, guidance, feedback, ideas and mock-ups. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, some feedback came just a little too late for me to respond to, as I had committed to one direction that I was (by that point) fine tuning. Thanks nonetheless, to Tanya, BJ, Tom C. and Andrew for their concepts. <BR> <BR><b>SPECIAL Thanks</b> to Scott K., Tiffany, and Hrant for their professorial like tutelage &ndash; never giving away too much, but just enough to inspire one to think about the design challenge in new ways. <BR> <BR><b>SUPERCALAFRAGILISTICEXPEALIDOCIOUS T h a n k s</b> to Randy Jones for his mentoring and hands on help perfecting those pesky script face beziers, not to mention other subtleties which really brought the final design to life. Thanks Aquatoad! <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/29180.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR><b>Notes About The Final Design</b> <BR>Much happened as compared to iteration &quot;10.74&quot; from my post #104, including weight and letterform changes to the &quot;M,&quot; a sizing up of &quot;Maui,&quot; and the obvious enhancements to &quot;Cruisers&quot; which include smoothing of the curves and connectors, adding weight to the face, a bit of vertical squashing, and a fine finishing flourish. Color directions have yet to be decided, but are likely to resemble the lavaesque orange currently displayed at the new website where you can see the logo basking: <BR><a href="http://www.mauimountaincruisers.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.mauimountaincruisers.com/">http://www.mauimountaincruisers.com/</a></a> <BR> <BR> <BR><b>What I Learned</b> <BR>SKETCH, SKETCH, SKETCH! Whether by pencil, paper and erasure (my preference) or tablet &ndash; there is simply no better way to work out solutions to logotype and letterform challenges than mad scientist like sketching. Have fun with it. Brainstorm, scribble any concept that comes to mind. <BR> <BR>There are many possible ways to solve a problem, but there's usually one or two that are &quot;best.&quot; Still, it's subjective, and what you consider best might be someone else's &quot;worst.&quot; <BR> <BR>Use your eyes. Always consider legibility. How do the letterforms &quot;sound&quot; to your eyes? Balance positive as well as negative space. White space is your friend &ndash; don't ignore it. <BR> <BR>Know when to say when. There comes a point where you have to commit, fine tune and finish &ndash; even with personal projects. <BR> <BR>Contrast is key, especially when it comes to logos with many words and letters such as this one. <BR> <BR> <BR><b>Typophile Props</b> <BR>Typophile, in my opinion, is the web's richest resource and community. The sheer abundance and quality of information available to type designers, typographers, and graphic designers is astonishing. <BR> <BR>I only hope that I can give back some iota of what I've received in my little time here. In fact, it's my prediction that I'll reach 6,000 post long before Hrant.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks again to everyone who participated.
