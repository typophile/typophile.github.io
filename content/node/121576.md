  body: Riccardo, Typic is a IPhone App so does it have a type bundle - I just assumed
    the fonts in it are coded into the app along with some icons. Thus I looked for
    things close.

  body: "iPhone apps are \u201Cbundles\u201D just like Mac OS X apps, but zipped.
    In OS X, you need to locate the desired app, which will have a .ipa extension
    (if you have them visible), then open it with the zip extractor of your choice.
    You will end with a folder. Inside this folder there will be another, called \u201CPayload\u201D,
    which contain the app (with a .app extension). Right-click to show the bundle
    content and somewhere in there you will find regular font files."
