  really cool looking font that was used for a custom motorcycle sticker on a vector
  site with the words \"HotWheels\" \r\n\r\nThe Designer had used Adobe Illustrator
  to design them, but hadn't mentioned the name of the font he used! :( \r\n\r\nI
  hope you guys can help me find the name of this font because I really really like
  it and need it to design a custom logo!\r\n\r\nI would be forever grateful to you
  guys if you can help me!\r\n\r\nI'm having trouble uploading a pic of it here directly,
