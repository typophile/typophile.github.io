  article]] the quasi-Presidential seal that showed up at an Obama event was roundly
  criticised and removed from the campaign the next day. \r\n\r\nThe graphic design
  saga of Obama's campaign has been covered extensively. \r\n\r\nThe Washington Post
  a week ago or so reported that Obama had reservations about the original O logo,
  finding it a bit too corporate, but went along with it, deferring to his advisors
  on this. David Axelrod seems to have commissioned it. \r\n\r\nThe 'presidential
  seal' thing was so close to parody that I wonder why they thought it was a good
  idea. I'm curious as to whether the different designers did the original O (great
  qualities, but a bit too cartoonish, IMHO), the superb \"Change we can rely on\"
  in Gotham, and then this misfire.   "

    White House contender Barack Obama will no longer be using a campaign seal that
    critics called an arrogant imitation of the US president's official emblem, according
    to reports today.\r\n\r\nThe seal was first seen on Friday at a meeting between
    Obama and Democratic state governors, causing tongues to wag owing to its close
    resemblance to the eagle logo displayed on the lectern whenever the president
    speaks in public.\r\n\r\nThe Obama seal had the same bald eagle clutching arrows
    and an olive branch, denoting war and peace, but inserted the words \"Vero possumus\"
    - a loose Latin translation of the Democrat's campaign slogan \"Yes, we can.\"\r\n\r\nOne
    Obama aide told Fox News that the widely panned seal was intended as a one-off
    for Friday's event. But Atlantic.com reported that the candidate himself felt
    the image had been a \"silly mistake.\"\r\n\r\nAn Obama spokesman could not be
    reached for comment.\r\n\r\nThe seal was greeted with universal derision by US
    media, and the campaign of Republican candidate John McCain called it \"laughable,
    ridiculous, preposterous and revealing all at the same time.\" </cite>"

    from using the <em>actual</em> presidential seal on their campaign materials.
    It is a pretty common design element in the genre, though not usually used on
    the lectern.\r\n\r\nObama's seal may have been an awkward parody, but at least
    he had good enough taste not to have presumptively used the real thing."

    signs. I don't know the italic. \r\n\r\nThis is beautifully executed, but just
    a terrible idea. I would guess that the same person did this and the original
    O, as it has a similar feel. It would be interesting to find out the history of
    this blunder. I wonder if it is a product of collaboration--someone, or some committee,
    got the \"bright idea\", and then had the designer execute it. "

    and I like the Obama camp's attention to design and marketing. It's a breath of
    fresh air in the political picture. But I suppose, if opponents find a way to
    criticize it in a way that can be distracting and disruptive, it's probably best
    to pull it off the shelf and move on. I think the critics (opponents) are scrambling
    for ways to make him look bad. The opponent's marketing flat out sucks by comparison.\r\n\r\n\"Change\"
    and \"Hope\" are kind of weak campaign themes, I think.  Too ambiguous. But that's
    beside the point.\r\n\r\n"

    those patriotic Dems who were flush with a fresh choice in Obama realise his branding
    of America - then Lou Dobbs just gained a few more fellow Independent registrants.
    \r\n\r\nOn a graphic forum that talks specifically with the POWER of marketing
    I wrote a piece about how people in times of struggle look for a reason to believe.
    Obama created a graphic heavy campaign specifically to target those votes (and
    continues to do so). If Obama doesn't check his ego - and stop subjugating America's
    patriotic symbols to his own greed/desires - he will surely push Independents
    over to McCain. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/obama_seal_3885.jpg]"
