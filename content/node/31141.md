  body: "If you scroll down on this page (http://www.typeoff.de/?p=107), you can copy
    these three images with Neue Hammer Unziale und American Uncial.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    if you go to a font retailer site, you can set web resolution one line samples,
    and then download these (myfonts.com, linotype.com, fontshop.com, or with FontExplorer
    X, etc\u2026)."
