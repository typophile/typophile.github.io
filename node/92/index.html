		<div class="commentbody">FOOL, why do you want to know my IP address, what do you think it will tell you!? Great, I've a dialup/cable/dsl account with an ISP - tens of thousands of others use the same ISP, so what? You could take a guess at who I was, but it'd only be a guess - you can't even verify a physical location with an IP, all of AT&amp;T's customer's resolve to New Jersey, because that's where their net block is registered. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Should we have them post your IP too, are you any braver than me? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If the admins of this board want to verify users then they shouldn't allow anonymous posts. If they want a membership scheme where everyone is absolutely known, then they should set one up. Don't moan about anonymity when you've already voted for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As to the moron. It's fairly straight forward. Someguy stated that a site was down. He was wrong, because, as you can see he wrote *labs.com, when the site URL is *lab.com, no &quot;s&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some other guy decided that I'd mispoke, because he couldn't be bothered to read the posts properly, and what was cited. I think that calling such a moron isn't to far from the truth. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Same guy thought he'd discerned the facts in a lengthy legal matter, took three years to be resolved, from a single court document - do you think there may be more documents, that discuss other aspects of this case, that are not published on the web? Seems likely to me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You may also note that the legal document concerned is something like six months old, the case has only just been resolved - did something happen in the mean time, did something happen before this? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you read the legal document properly, you'll see that the defendant is basically being accused of lying in his defence. The judge has odered that the defendant be subjected to a discovery process, sat in a room and asked question after question, all documented - the judge must therefore agree that there is something to the plaintiff's accusation of falsehood, though he doesn't strike out the defendant's statement at that time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you got this far, you'll see that the defendant was also ordered to pay the costs of this hearing before the court - again suggesting the judge had seen/heard evidence as to the falsehoods claimed, and accepted those claims. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think that, if someone wants to start posting figures about this or that, then they should at least understand the process, and the figures they are quoting. Someone who didn't do that, just going for the headlines, would, in my opinion, rightly be called a moron. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You may also want to consider that the same person was ranting on a few days ago at Creative Pro, about how the defendant &quot;never had to pay a single red cent&quot; (see comments in response to John D Berry's latest dt font article). In a few days less than a &quot;red cent&quot; has been inflated to $1000, is he going to find some more &quot;facts&quot; (ie the real thing, not stuff he wants to opine about), will the costs to the defendant get inflated to $10,000, $100,000, a million!? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If we don't find the facts, will we *know* that it was only ever $1,000 - like he *knew* a few days ago that it was &quot;nothing&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This same person has claimed costs to a single plaintiff were hundreds of thousands of dollars (posted here, and then deleted - I can't have been the only person that saw it). How does he know, does he work for any of the foundries concerned, does he cite some evidence. No he does not. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If that same person then went off tangentially, with no knowledge of the facts, and no evidence to support his statements to essentially berate those who had no choice other than to defend their rights (their rights protected by long-standing legislation), then I think again he would rightly be described as a moron. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But, why take me seriously, I have no standing as an anonymous poster. But do you really know who anyone is in this forum, are they all validated just because they gave a name, do they have any greater standing, are they really who they say they are? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There was a guy used to post to a mailing list with the mail address &quot;nevillebrody@[an isp].fr&quot;, what do you reckon are the chances? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And now I got really upset, let's put this into perspective. This *moron*, this troll, this seeker of truth and justice, this fukcing idiot that will post anything he likes with no backup whatsoever just so he can point fingers and use innuendo to convict - is no better than Apostrophe anyway. This moron pirated a font, was discovered, and had to have debt collectors sent out after him to get him to pay the license fee. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The font he pirated, just happens to be put out by one of the foundries in this case, whom he is trying so hard to bait and embarrass. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Papazian, you are a worm, go back and crawl under your rock where you belong. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who has standing here, Papazian because he puts his name? And what is that worth?</div>

Twice he was allowed to rejoin based mostly on his reputation, but after the third time he was not allowed back.

And what is that worth?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You want a dollar amount, you materialistic cretin? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Standing?! You're not using your name because you don't have any yourself! I am what I am, and refuse to hide it. And I'm not worried, because -as much as there's so much room for improvement- I'm still a better person than you and your miserly cohorts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; that was harsh! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Riiight. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I grew up in a civil war, with car bombs, snipers, no running water, the works. At 17 I was guarding my high school with a &quot;klashin&quot; (AK-47). This little conflict -which is destroying your lives- is essentially just entertainment for me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; bragging about this act of piracy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; dared the designer to do something about it <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->More distortions. Don't believe the hype, as they say. Read the archives, and decide for yourselves what *really* happened. I have nothing to hide, especially not my name! The only thing I'd like to avoid (but probably less than you) is wasting time repeating history. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The bottom line -in this context- is this: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You cannot harm me. Against my clear written warning, you decided to make an enemy out of me. But this is *not* payback - it's just lack of self-censorship. If you had not made an enemy out of me, you would simply be assured favoritism from me, in the form of keeping my mouth shut to help a friend in need. I have a weakness in being too honest, and here I see no reason to shut up. It's that simple! And I told you this would happen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also note this: as a favor to one of you who *did* ask me nicely to keep my mouth shut, I did not reply to Ole's original post. But when I saw yet another attempt at spin-doctoring from your gang (and I do mean gang) in the form of &quot;Though I don't think he'll be having much to say&quot; I got provoked into correcting that attempt at distortion. The truth is that Apostrophe won (and might win even more soon), and you're trying to hide it. The fact that he *shouldn't* have won (as far as I'm concerned) does not relieve you of the responsability to be honest. You will understand that as an Armenian I have a particular aversion to historical revisionism. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The only thing you can -and are- doing is harming Typophile. Do not drag Typophile into this - it can only bring more grief, especially to you! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So maybe you should be kicked off from here as well. Unless you can admit defeat and regain your senses. Pronto. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&mdash;- <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now that you've read the above in anger, please do everybody a favor and re-read it calmly with just a little bit of objective self-doubt: if my remaining iota of faith in you is justified, you will realize this: you need to change. And don't worry about me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As the only person to post in this thread who was actually a party to this lawsuit, let me set a couple of things straight. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First, the document Ole Sørenson listed does not represent &quot;court findings&quot; in this matter. You'll see from its date that this order significantly predates the settlement of Emigre et al v. Apostrophe, which was closed in March 2002. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Second, neither side &quot;won&quot; or &quot;lost&quot; in this matter. The parties settled the lawsuit; settlements are, by definition, agreeable to both parties. You should not find the words &quot;won&quot; or &quot;lost&quot; in any press release issued by the foundries. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Third, no party to this lawsuit is at liberty to disclose the financial terms of the settlement. Anyone implying otherwise is, to use the legal term, talking out of their . <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, on a personal note, let me just say that I find these sweeping generalizations about the villainy of the commercial type industry to be not only childish, piteous, bizarre, vindictive, and wholly unproductive, but somewhat insulting as well. Anyone on this board who has a beef with the practices of a particular company is welcome to air their grievances &ndash; professionals consider this a cost of doing business. But as a commercial type foundry, which basically means a type designer with &quot;Inc&quot; for a last name, I really don't appreciate being characterized by any of the foul and slanderous language used above. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am a type designer, and I work my butt off trying to create an environment in which I and my colleagues can produce the best typefaces we're capable of creating. Anyone who thinks otherwise just doesn't know me. And anyone who thinks that the &quot;Inc&quot; in my name makes me &quot;miserly,&quot; &quot;litigious,&quot; &quot;misguided,&quot; &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;self-righteous&quot; just doesn't know business.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; You are under no restrictions here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes I am. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Then why did you say (post) it? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I didn't say anything remotely close to &quot;the commercial type industry is villaneous&quot;. Because I don't believe that. My complaint is with a certain minority, people who are poisoning and polarizing the field. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; How do you know if they're good or bad? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't &quot;know&quot; it, I feel it. Just like you do! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's basically the normal way people make their decisions about others - personal character judgment - but we each have our variations - which we need to mutually tolerate. Example: I talked to Rodrigo Cavazos for a few minutes at TypeCon98, and I could feel his goodness. I can't point to what I saw in his eyes, or what I heard in the timber of his voice, but I know what I feel. But also, I listen to who's saying what - and analyze what they really mean in the context of where they're coming from. I peel the layers, and look as deep as I can, while trying to peel my *own* layers which might interfere with a good evaluation. When I like or dislike somebody, I ask myself: why do I feel this way? And sometimes I realize that a psychological issue on my end is causing me to judge that person unfairly. So I correct it - or at least try to. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I'd be an idiot to claim that I'm clairvoyant - I make judgment mistakes all the time - every human does. But at a given moment I believe what I believe, and I act on it. If I'm less tentative than most people, and that makes certain poeple uncomfortable, *they* need to deal with it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Do you know the whole situation on which you are commenting? Are you sure your &quot;sources&quot; have given you all of the facts? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I know *enough* of it, about certain entities - which I cannot allow myself to name - but is it really necessary anyway? People who I don't have enough &quot;information&quot; about (like you) I tend to give the benefit of the doubt. And when they come out like you did and openly ask rational questions with good poise and self-control, then I start to think better of them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sources? My best source is myself - other sources I always trust less than 50%. But I'm really not extrapolating very much. Trust me, I don't enjoy knowing what I know - but I'm very bad at looking the other way. Maybe I have a sick attraction to conflict, or maybe I can remain lucid under much greater &quot;conflict-pressure&quot; than most people, or a combination. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can only hope that you believe me when I say that certain zealots in this industry are lashing out and victimizing people left and right, including people they should not alienate, including people who are still on their side but remain oblivious to their destructive fundamentalism. Why do they not see it? Maybe because it would hurt too much. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But whether you believe me or not is a non-issue for me - I'm not a politician looking for votes. I have no agenda. I am doing this because it's the right thing to do at this instant. Anybody who really knows me will tell you that I don't plan ahead more than a couple of meals. Which doesn't mean I'm reckless, at a given moment. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; you are throwing around some pretty heavy insults <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The insults are commensurate with their actions. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When people make mistakes, they suffer the consequences. I didn't make up that law, I'm just part of the equation. The path to happiness is through self-improvement, not the punishment of others - and I'm enabling the communication (external and internal) necessary to the realization of this fact. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think some people have a serious problem with me for a very simple reason: I am bad for business. Suffice it to say that I'm not exactly the biggest fan of capitalism&hellip; But in the end I am not the problem. Just like you, I am part of the solution. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jared, I think you hit the nail on the head, Papazian does seem to be proposing that the foundries concerned should not have persued this case through legal means. What does he want them to do instead? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He also seems to want to drag other type vendors into this, as weight behind his claims, stating that they did not take part in the suit - specifically Adobe. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->His point here seems to be that because Adobe did not take part then the suit was without merit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is there any logic to this claim? It doesn't appear so, without knowing why Adobe didn't take part. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One thing is fairly evident though. My experience of Adobe's legal efforts is that they have always been pursued against commercial piracy. I don't know of any instances where they have pursued cases against individuals distributing their intellectual property for no (direct) financial gain. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps this is corporate policy at Adobe, and would explain why they took no part in this case. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In any event, I believe it's true to say that this case united a greater number of foundries in one case than has ever been the case before - we should take that as testimony as to the integrity with which that case was pursued. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Papazian's mud slinging sticks to all the plaintiffs in this case (see the list of designers cited at the URL given at the top of this page) - yet he offers no evidence to back up his accusations, and no remedy to what he (alone) sees as wrong-doing.</div>

You and others are aligning yourselves with these covert, rabid name-callers, whether you realize it, want it, or not. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The bottom line is that if we're going to reduce piracy, we have to be *stronger* and *smarter* than them. Alienating people who are essentially on your side but simply don't agree with you 1000% backfires - as it is doing now. Just because -as an example- I don't share some people's deluded dependence on the letter of the law doesn't mean we can't work together for a more harmonious co-existence.

I did not choose this confrontation - they brought it upon us. Some of my opponents here simply do not realize what's happening (yet) - and those people I cannot hold too liable.

BTW, I am willing to share them in much greater detail in person - any time. Like ATypI's upcoming conference in Rome, if you like. I am sorry if my obtuseness here is frustrating - but think what it's doing to me! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And note this: I would indeed have stayed quiet if it were not for that original attempt at putting a spin on what really happened: &quot;Though I don't think he'll be having much to say.&quot; If we don't realize and admit that Apostrophe is very much alive and kicking, in fact fighting *back* now, then we're shortchanging our long-term prospects. Why? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have no vendetta - I am simply trying to pull down the unethical distortions that are being aired right in front of my eyes! I am slinging no mud - they are sitting in mud of their own doing - I have simply erected a roadsign alerting motorists. Now, some of the people are sitting in mud because they have mistakenly associated with unethical fanatics - they need to get up, and wash off. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My actions here are actually a reaction to their misleading spin-doctoring. This is a key point: I am not conducting some crusade, but simply trying to balance a wrong which I have seen aired before my eyes. I am ready to stop, as long as no new spins are introduced. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, Jared, how come I can't voice my opinion freely without necessarily giving out &quot;hard evidence&quot;, but anonymous people can conduct a vile, profane defamation campaign against me with no resistance? I think you are being unfair. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So go ahead you people, have the last word, throw more insults, whatever - and I'll stay quiet.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant has asked me to intervene on his behalf, since he feels that he's being unfairly victimized by anonymous assailants. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think it's unfortunate to let legitimate discourse descend into personal attacks, but that goes for everyone. I'm disappointed by the anonymous posters here who feel the need to assail Hrant with foul language, but I'm equally irritated that Hrant has continued to impugn the eleven plaintiffs in &quot;Emigre at al&quot; without ever lodging a specific grievance against any of us. Both Rich Roat and I have prompted you to speak your mind, Hrant, which you've refused to do. I think this is irresponsible of you, and it makes it hard for everyone to take your arguments seriously. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since Hrant has given me permission to respond to his e-mail in public, here are my thoughts on the subject. Hrant wrote: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;   To me you are -knowingly on not- giving backing to these <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;   &quot;infants&quot;. I know you don't agree with their tactics, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;   that's part of the reason I think it might be your place <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;   to strike a note of moderation. Otherwise, they get worse <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;   and worse, for example in victimizing anybody who dares to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;   say something even tangentially nice about me or my work. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;   That's the pattern - trust me, I've had the &quot;pleasure&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;   of having seen it many times.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Knowingly or not&quot; is a clever way of simultaneously absolving you of the burden of proof, and making it impossible for me to defend myself against this accusation. How would you like it if someone posted &quot;Hrant is &ndash; knowingly or not &ndash; promoting domestic violence?&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At best this is sophistry, at worst it's slander. You should be happy that this recent court case has tempered my taste for litigation, or you might find yourself on the business end of a defamation suit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is Jared and Joe's board, so they make the rules, but I'd like to suggest the following guidelines: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   1. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Attack the post, not the poster.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> There are apparently ancient vendettas at work here; I find them tiresome and irrelevant. If you're not here to talk about typography, you should leave. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   2. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back up your arguments.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Even if your contributions are as juvenile as &quot;Helvetica sucks,&quot; be prepared to be challenged by your peers. And if you're wading into more sensitive waters, say, maligning the professional practices of a contributor to this site, you'd better have the goods to support your accusations. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   3. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don't rely on anonymity.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Aside from being in poor taste, it's dumb. I imagine that if push came to shove, Jared and Joe would honor a subpoena for Typophile's IP records, which are delightfully verbose. Please keep this in mind as you flame away.</div>
