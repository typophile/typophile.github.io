<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hearing a word "rip" several times a week was pretty normal for me once. Those were the times when I was browsing other forums on a regular basis, loosing my time reading crap and browsing the net really a lot. One of the outcomes is - I fear the word "rip". I fear it most definitely in a good way - I didn't stop working on my projects, but I also started to be ultra-critique to my work, especially in terms of ripping someone other's masterpieces. <br>And it's turning really weird sometimes. There is a project, there are all variables in my disposition, I have a chance to express my style, my way of thinking (do I have one, I wonder?), while satisfying client's goals and expectations. Sounds nice, huh? Not really. Lately I feel like being in a vacuum of thoughts - I lost if not the whole, then a big part of vision I had, I find myself doing the same stuff over and over again (like doing sketches of a logo and then seeing, that I finally have a GM Saturn's logo looking at me instead of something original; or I end up having something really close to what I've done before and it hurts my eyes even more than Saturn's copy). And that's bothering me a lot. Really a lot. <br>I see other people's works, and I see ideas behind the pictures, I see what a stranger wouldn't see, but would notice and remember - and that's what I lack. I lack ideas. <br>So I decided to go the most unoriginal and common way - tipped amazon.com and bought some nice books. Like "Design Writing Research" or "Stop Stealing Ship...", etc. I read them carefully. At least, I think I did. But I didn't find what I was looking for - an idea on ideas, a hint on direction. Nothing. I learnt something new, for sure, but not what I was eager to. <br> <br>Tell me what you do. How do you not copy others and yourself, stay fresh, get ideas - where is your inspiration? A design is not a pure inspiration, but I got a lot on the other side of the coin and I need to get the darker side shining as well. <br> <br>Start here.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Books won't work - no other person can formally teach you to be[come] creative. <br> <br>Try doing things you've never done before - that's the only way I know of triggering inspiration, as long as you're not consciously obsessing about it. And best of all is travelling to strange places. You're in Frankfurt. Try a vacation in Tunis. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I didn't know - where did he go? I like Klee - great notan. <br> <br>I know it worked for my dad: he tells how during the writing of his PhD thesis at Ohio State he became completely stuck. He went on a month-long vacation with wife and daughter to Florida. He got back, and that night during his sleep he found the missing piece of the puzzle. <br> <br>And I've yet to "process" all that I saw during my trip to Bangkok more than three years ago. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Go to a science museum and don't pay attention to how the graphics look, pay attention to what they say. Look past the subject of the photos at the details of the pictures. <br> <br>See if you can get a tour of a factory and go and watch the people and machines. <br> <br>Change locations/vacations - what Hrant said - if you can, and you don't have a bad deadline. Or, if you can take the risk, do it in spite of the deadline. Try to go places you never go. <br> <br>If you use a computer to design, use a paintbrush, some latex paint and some newspaper to design. Try everything that you don't do. Pay attention to what you think and feel when you do it. Change the music you listen to. Doesn't have to be forever, just for a time. <br> <br>If you do look at books look at books about things other than design or type. Look at sports books, history books, comic books, science books. <br> <br>You can't be creative from a book, and you can't be creative if you can't see other things, ways, an approaches to life's problems and life's purposes. I love <a href=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/program.html>science stuff</a>. So much of it is just so <a href=http://www.sandia.gov/pulspowr/facilities/zaccelerator.html>amazing</a> (check out the second picture on the right right click to download it, it's big but so insanely cool). <br> <br>Hang in there man. Lots of us feel less creative as Winter rolls around here in the northern hemisphere.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Rather than worry about your "creativity" or lack thereof, focus on the craft of what you do. Your technique. Repetition of, and attention to the details of your work can cause you to discover things you did not know were there.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Try creating bad design -- really bad. That can be a sort of "palate cleanser" for all the mediocrity that builds up in one's head. The next day, turn it into something crazily good. <br> <br>If you're going to read for inspiration, don't read about graphic design, Read about ideas, inventions, how things work, events that changed the world, stunning beauty, appalling atrocity, inexplicable strangeness. Find authors of fiction or poetry whose work you think you don't understand. <br> <br>All of these are ways of turning down the volume on your analytical mind, and turning up the volume on your receptive, creative mind. <br> <br>Also, know that every designer has periods like this. It's your job to find a way out of it -- but don't panic. It's normal.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Another thought... <br> <br>This may be just me, but when I'm feeling locked into mediocrity I like to go to the zoo. For one thing, watching how different animals move is inspirational: otter, elephant, owl, boa constrictor, orangutan. For another, the inherent tension between preservation and captivity makes sparks for me. I'm sure this is not universal, but there must be other places or activities that make sparks for you. Find them.</div>
