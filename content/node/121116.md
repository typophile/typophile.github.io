  body: "The book being published by Gestalten, I would have expected they used one
    of their typefaces, or, at least, would have show a colophon for it somewhere.
    On both fronts, my searches were fruitless.\r\nIn case it's a reprint, we could
    be looking for a non yet digitised typeface. I haven't found any digital equivalent
    which shares all the characteristics of the sample. \r\nI thought it could be
    some version of Akzidenz-Grotesk (a typeface Rams himself is known to have used
    extensively), but while there are lot of variations (especially in letters like
    |s| and |R|), I cannot find any with an |M| like the one in the sample."
