  process of fonts. Actually I would lie if I said I understand it completely, but
  slowly getting there perhaps.\r\n\r\nHere is one interesting issue I noticed, however,
  \ which makes me wonder if hints really are that good. It could also be that I am
  missing something very important here, but everybody tells me that Autohinting with
  Adobes AFDK 2.0 is quite good.\r\nWhat I have done here is to make one font with
  hints and one without. The standard stem values are the same and also the Alignment
  zones have the exact same value.\r\n\r\nNow look what happens when I use the font
  in InDesign. The funny thing is that, the bigger size the worse hinting.\r\n\r\nIn
  the last example the letters are really distorted as you see.\r\n\r\nAny thought
  on this? Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hintsornotwhat_4501.png]"

    fonts might even perform better <em>without</em> manual hints on ClearType displays.
    Can someone confirm? What about OS X's CoolType?

    screens and/or print on low resolution outputs?

  body: "Sometimes OS X's hinting can be somewhat shoddy.  Especially if a glyph contains
    multiple shapes.  Compare a single grave \xE0 with a double grave \u0201.  The
    double grave almost doesn't even register at 12pt and is less than a hairline
    at even 18-24 pt.  But the larger the font size gets, the more the two acutes
    look the same.  It seems to happen more with negative sloped forms (compare double
    acute a\u030B to double grave \u0201) or those whose looser curve is above a tighter
    curve (compare breve \u0103 inverted breve \u0203).  But I've even run into it
    causing problems with the Cyrillic \u044B in one of the fonts I'm working on.

  body: "Hmm, I guees it\u2019s a matter of opinion here after all. Hinting is all
    about choosing between to have a crisp sharp appearance on screen that will be
    somewhat distorted in its letterform OR keep the letterform but settle for a less
    sharp crispiness. Isn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\nInstead of celebrating Valentines Day
    like I really should, I have now inspected some fonts I (the ad agency I\u2019m
    working for) have. They all suffer the same problem. Sometimes its more obvious
    and sometimes less. It depends on the shapes of the letterforms.\r\n\r\nThey are
    all hinted, and they all change a little bit in proportions of the letterform
    depending on which size I display the font on, on the screen. A one-point-size-change
    can sometimes almost don\u2019t do any difference at all (the letter is hinted
    to the nearest pixel or something?).\r\n\r\nSome other times, the font makes a
    bigger step visually in font size (I guess it then stick to the next \"grid\")
    even though I only change the size one point as before.\r\n\r\nLetters like v
    and w \u2013 sometimes they go a little bit too far below the baseline compared
    to the other letters, and sometimes they jump up to it\u2019s right position.\r\n\r\nIs
    this what hinting is about? In that case I guess it\u2019s up to the font developer
    to decide which to choose. Both a hinted font and an unhinted have \"issues\".
    None of them are perfect.\r\n\r\nOf course it also depends on how the letterforms
    itself are created?\r\nIf that is true, then I understand what happened to my
    font (as shown above) because I really tried to display the font with small, small
    changes in size \u2013 comparing it to the un-hinted above, and then there was
    a certain moment when this big distorsion appeared (last example).\r\n\r\nOr are
    there someone out there that believes hinting could be done perfect without ANY
    of these distorsions? Is it even possible?\r\n\r\nSorry if my thought sounds a
    bit stupid, but I also having some problems expressing myself on english :)\r\n"

    today actually has high-res displays, whether hinting is worth doing depends on
    what the font will be used for. If it's going to be used as a UI font or as the
    primary reading font in an app like a Web browser, then yeah, you need to hint.
    If it's primarily used for print, or only in display sizes, or you only care about
    computers shipping after the year 2012, then nah, don't bother.\r\n\r\nIf you
    do hint, you need to choose between TrueType and Type1 (CFF) flavors. The former

    at this moment. It makes me start digging deeper, so....\r\n\r\nThis is Warnock
    Pro. A very beautiful font that I believe comes with the CS2 package. Now, this
    is hinted by Adobe I guess (?) which of course means good quality. I am absolutely
    not saying anything negative about Adobe here, just to make that clear \u2013
    just trying to understand the \"Art of Hinting\".\r\n\r\nLook \u2013 it has the

    Is it a compromise where you choose crispy looking letters on screen before letterforms

    That is, the whole purpose of hints is to distort the letterforms in favor of
    some higher purposes such as stroke consistency or legibility or what-have-you.\r\n\r\nIf
    you experiment with BlueScale a bit, you'll soon find that with pretty much every
    typeface, there will be some specific ppem size (or range of sizes) for which
    it looks bad if you allow overshoot, and it looks bad if you suppress overshoot,
    and you just have to decide which is worse.\r\n\r\nOf course, with rendering technologies
    and screens having improved, it is at least plausible to think about foregoing
    hinting altogether. There was a time when that was not the case.\r\n\r\nRaph wrote:
    <cite>Hinting is a transitional problem, only useful as long as we have low resolution
    displays.</cite>\r\n\r\nAgreed. Once displays get up around 400+ dpi, hinting
    will become pretty unimportant. Even 200 or 250 dpi will make hinting a lot less
    critical. Mind you, I wonder if really basic displays on newly-enabled devices
    will get those resolutions as soon as our computers and cell phones: will your
    fridge, toaster, range and microwave all have high-res displays? If not, hinting
    may be with us for longer than we think, just important on a different class of
    devices.\r\n\r\nGuifa wrote: <cite>Sometimes OS X\u2019s hinting can be somewhat
    shoddy.</cite>\r\n\r\nOS X is doing rasterizing (rendering), not hinting. Hinting
    is what goes into the font, and rasterizing is the process of taking that hinted
    font and turning it into a pattern of pixels on screen or dots in print.\r\n\r\nSorry
    for being picky about the terminology, but this stuff is plenty complicated even
    when we're using the right terms for things!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
