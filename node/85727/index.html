Then there will be the nationalist arguments over the names of certain languages claimed by bordering nations. I expect that the hassle would mean only a few designers would even see the process through, and plenty more will just ignore it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As In recall, the term "Pro" came about years ago in the early opentype era when Adobe was retro-fitting their legacy fonts with the old "Expert sets". The name was pulled out of the thinking that the only people who ever used the Expert Sets were design or publishing professionals.  It was also only 3 letters long.
Several years ago, I was asked by SoTA to write an article for their supposedly annual "Interrobang" publication on OpenType.  They never published it for some mysterious reason which I have ever been privy to.  Part of it addressed the "Pro" question.  I will try to dig up the old file and post the "pro" related part of it here if anyone is interested.</div>

Then we should probably educate our customers better about these terms. Often such information are missing on foundry websites or buried deep with the support section. 
To me, "Light", "Basic"/"Standard", "Pro"/"Premium" are pretty universal terms for separating different versions of software products or bundles. Coming up with even more new abbreviations would only make things worse. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">>As I understand the original Adobe use of Pro, it was a font with some CE latin support. Some mistook that for meaning a font had rich typographic OT features, others took it to mean non-latin support.

As I remember, 'Pro' was used to imply that the OT font had 'some' additional OT features incorporated into it to distinguish from other standard fonts. The only way a user could find out 'what those features' where, was to use the font and poke around to see what OT features where available from within an application.

The 'Pro' at the end of font name meant nothing. Some understood it to mean 'Professional', whatever that means.

Anyway, that's the whole problem with the way we all name stuff. Myself included. We are all guilty of this practice.

I was hoping that at least within the 'typophile' group, we could all discuss the entire 'font naming' structure and come up with guidelines that we can all follow. At least, come to some sort of general consensus, and try to clarify what all these terms should mean.

If we don't, who will?

>Chris Keegan— You say to use "ML" for 'multi languages. Not a bad idea. But, what 'multi languages' are we talking about.

I know what 'greek' or 'cyrillic' means after the font name. But what does 'ML' imply? It's not clear.

If we do this, and I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but then we have to supply a guide to all users to decode this stuff.

I like the idea of using 'acronyms', but they need to be chosen carefully.

Everyone is welcome to use, in-part, or as a whole. I think it's elegant and all-inclusive. Easy to understand and expand on.

'Font names' remain as short in length as possible, and offer a lot of information about what is contained in font.

I personally, do not think that adding a brief description of weight or 'body proportion' is needed, but others may want to add this as well. I think that the 'user' will quickly get the idea, by the numbers alone, if font is 'regular weight', or 'condensed', or 'expanded' by the numbers alone. Maybe, down-the-road, we can start to drop this reference in order to minimize the font names still further. Anyway, a good start. General consensus, please?

Swash= 'Swh'
Ornamental Caps= 'OrC'

Outline= 'Out'
Inline= 'Inl'

Stencil= 'Stn'
Graffiti= 'Grf'

Optical Axis (Large x-height)= 'Lxh'

If anyone can think of any others, we can add to this list.

I'm not sure about adding acronyms for 'extended language' support.

But, that can easily be done... example...

Central European= 'CE'

Greek= 'Grk'

Cyrillic= 'Cry'

etc...

Original initial post:
"
As the subject line says. Can we come up with different terms to describe the glyph content of a font?

As I understand the original Adobe use of Pro, it was a font with some CE latin support. Some mistook that for meaning a font had rich typographic OT features, others took it to mean non-latin support. Perhaps there can be no agreed upon term.

Well, if you don't fall for that "update"* and actually
bother to read (which is generally quite a bit less bad
than watching TV for example) you would learn that
James once tried to sweep this thread under the rug,
and is now trying to prevent people from noticing <em>that</em>.
Once you learn that, you might be able to put certain
posts in context in terms of why some people take part
in Typophile at all. You can then properly filter (but
never ignore) everything they say.

* Which was basically to reinstate the title and
entire original post (which had been completely
deleted) and add a sleight-of-hand at the end, and
was tellingly carried out immediately after this:
http://typophile.com/node/90174#comment-495635

BTW it's quite selfish to try to demote the efforts
of people like Alex simply to look less bad in public.

Typophile is littered with threads that have
been resolved many years later. And you know it.
