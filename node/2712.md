body: Hello folks, <BR>Client is saying this font is called &#34;Stewardson&#34; but
  I can&#39;t find it. Looks a bit like News Gothic but I can&#39;t match. Anyone...?

  body: I have one sample of a typeface called Stewardson here, but it doesn&#39;t
    look like the one you posted at all, it looks more like Gill. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24130.gif"

  body: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!... <BR> <BR>Adobe Sans Multiple Master substitution
    font. So basically  <BR>this is not a font, it&#39;s merely a replacement courtesy
    of  <BR>SuperATM, in order to allow you to read the text without  <BR>having the
    typeface installed. <BR> <BR>For further information on this unnatural phenomenon,

  body: Actually - can someone enlighten me briefly as to what the dickens is a Adobe
    Sans multiple master. I know what a multiple master is but is the Adobe Sans version
    something that comes packaged in with Adobe products like Illustrator and InDesign?
    Sorry if this is a dumb question but I&#39;ve never come across this beast in
    my typography travels.
