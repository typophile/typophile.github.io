  some regard as a present for a little logo I did her. \r\n\r\nI just wondered if
  people had anything they would recommend? Nothing too expensive. Something with
  a bit of theory and a bit of experience would be perfect, I'm not so much looking
  for an instructional guide as musings/discussions on type design. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  would be greatly appreciated, thanks :)\r\n\r\nG\r\n\r\nps. I already have the triumvirate,

  body: "Hi all, \r\n\r\nThanks very much for your suggestions. \r\n\r\nI'd say the
    price range is \xA35 to \xA315. \r\n\r\nShould have said that I already own Leslie
    Carbarga's 'L,F&LBible' and Ellen Lupton's 'Thinking with Type'. Ta though.\r\n\r\n'The
    Stroke' by Gerrit Noordzij was something I'd had a look at. It deals with constructing
    typefaces from the point of view of the written letter. I was wondering if anyone
    knew of any books that approach type design from the opposite point of view; rejecting
    the stroke and considering each glyph as a collection of shapes? This is something
    that I am equally interested in. \r\n\r\n[I'm not trying to start an argument
    about which is the right approach here, I'm just intrigued by both perspectives]\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help, \r\n\r\nG"

  body: "re. The Stroke: <em>It deals with constructing typefaces from the point of
    view of the written letter.</em>\r\n\r\nWell, no, it doesn't deal with \u2018constructing
    typefaces\u2019 at all. I'm not sure that type is even mentioned in the book,
    except perhaps in passing. It's an approach to analysing and understanding what
    is happening in letterforms in terms of stroke construction. As such, I'd say
    it is a fundamental text, even if one's approach to type design is more or less
    independent of such analysis. It's not about a right or wrong way to design type,
    but about building analytical toolsets that enable one to understand what one
    is doing and looking at. I'd love to be able to recommend another book that provides
    a comparable analytical approach to letters \u2018as collections of shapes\u2019,
    but to my knowledge such a book doesn't exist. Perhaps because type designs approached
    in such a way tend to be individual, so there is no common model that can be applied
    to their analysis.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Walter Tracy's <em>Letters of Credit</em>
    remains one of the best books on the subject of type design."

    As to there being a right and a wrong way to design a typeface\u2026\_Well I think
    the various aborted attempts at type design I have undertaken show that there
    are approaches that don't quite work :) \r\n\r\nAnother question. Does anyone
    know of any  books that look into Evert Bloemsma's work? In particular Legato.\r\n\r\nCheers,

    alternative or complementary analytical approach to the Noordzijan stroke model.
