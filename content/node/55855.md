  body: "I think this is a custom logo. Some of theBauhaus-style fonts, like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/pump/|Pump]],
    could be slanted to sort of resemble this. Another font I like , for a feel like
    this, is the heavy weight of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/charon/|Linotype
    Charon]], although it's not even slightly a match.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
