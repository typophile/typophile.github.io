  would point me to the post, I'd be perfectly satisfied. But tell me, what are the
  legalities/ethics of an homage typeface, such as this sample I threw together, affectionately
  termed <strong>Scratch Garamond</strong>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Scratch_5779.jpg]\r\n\r\nWould
  you consider that to be within the bounds of fair play, as a legitimate deconstruction/homage,
  or is it a blatant ripping off of a classic (or, worse yet, outright prosecutable
  theft)?"

  body: "\"I threw together\"\r\n\r\nDid you derive this from an exisiting digital
    font, by loading into a font editor and adding the scratches? Did you trace it
    from a published specimen? Or did you draw it from, er scratch? Depending on your
    answer there maybe legal (EULA) and ethical issues, despite the fact that the
    design of the original \"Garamond\" metal types are in the public domain  "
