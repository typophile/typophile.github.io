  body: "Chinese typefaces' classification is obviously very different from that of
    latin/western scripts. That said, you could look for a \"gothic\" style (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_sans-serif_typeface).\r\nPlease
    note also the difference between traditional and simplified Chinese.\r\n"

  body: "In the context of Chinese, the typeface style that you're looking for is
    called <em>Heiti</em> (\u9ED1\u4F53 <em>h\u0113it\u01D0</em>) or simply <em>Hei</em>.\r\n\r\nIn
    Japanese, it is called <em>Gothic</em> (\u30B4\u30B7\u30C3\u30AF\u4F53 <em>goshikkutai</em>),
    and in Korean, it is called <em>Dotum</em> (\uB3CB\uC6C0 <em>dotum</em>), though
    before the mid-1990s it was called <em>Gothic</em> (\uACE0\uB515\uCCB4/\uACE0\uB515\u9AD4
    <em>godikche</em>) like Japanese.\r\n\r\nIn terms of font suggestions, consider
    Adobe Heiti Std Regular, which is bundled with a wide range of Adobe applications,
    including Adobe Reader. Contact me offline for details."
