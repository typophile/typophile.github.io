  body: It's an enlarged halftone screen pattern. Look for "Color Halftone" in the
    Filters menu. Make sure to convert the image to grayscale first, otherwise you'll
    get CMYK color dots.

    what I want are dots that are actually separated.\r\n\r\nbut thanks."

  body: "As Mark said this is just a halftone screen. Another way to do this is:\r\n\r\nConvert
    your image to grayscale. Adjust levels or curves until you get good contrast.
    You may have to dodge and burn certain areas. Then convert the image to bitmap
    mode (Image/Mode/Bitmap). For \"Method\" select \"Halftone Screen\" use a low
    number for frequency to get large dots, select your angle, and probably round
    dots (although there are other options). You may have to play around with settings
    to get the result you're after.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Photoshop plug-in from
    Andromeda Software that does a variety of halftone effects."

  body: Ken - That is a black & white halftone. What mark was saying is that if you
    convert your RGB image in photoshop to Greyscale and then apply the halftone filter
    that normally gives you a 'CMYK style' separation pattern you can get this kind
    of non-colored pattern instead.

    an enlarged halftone dots). \r\n\r\nActually it should properly be called a fake
    duotone because the green is merely a flat color and not tonal in any way.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow
    in these days of cheap 4-color printing it is a little used 2-color effect, but
    it certainly can be done in photoshop"

    one were doing this effect with a spot color, I would tend to go for a color that
    isn't.\r\n\r\nBTW, there is a \"Pantone Color & Black Selector\" book which shows
    halftone overprints, as well as duotones, for 74 colors, on both coated and uncoated

  body: "The way Chris describes by converting to bitmap is a true halftone dot as
    opposed to using the filter which is only simulating the look of a half-tone dot.
    So if you plan to make a film for screenprinting or letterpressing, you would
    want to go the bitmap route.\r\n"

  body: "The mechanical screen halftone was preceded by several other mechanical manual
    \"multi-dotting\" tools.\r\nI don't know whether they were stamps, or rollers,
    or both. \r\nYou can see these effects on old postcards.\r\n\r\nPrior to mechanical
    halftones, tonal reproductions of photographs could be printed by collotype--IMO
    the most superior of the early photo-reproduction printing methods.\r\n\r\nPrior
    to photography, don't forget a ground of etching powder on metal, and the texture
    of stone on lithography, both of which may be manipulated by hand to achieve graduated
    tonal effects. \r\n\r\nDressmakers use a little spiked wheel for perforating a
    line into paper patterns."

    Nice and smooth compared to the irregular dots that result from the VecTips approach
    that CreativeNRG linked to. Ryan Putnam at VecTips linked to [[http://www.astutegraphics.com/|Phastasm]],
    a plug-in for AI. I haven't tried that, but I'm satisfied with your simple and
    elegant software at this point. Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/vector_comparison_4878.jpg]
