  body: Don't think I've seen that one. I wonder if it has the same woody origins
    as <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/red_rooster/phosphate_solid/">Phosphate</a>.

  body: "Thanks Stephen for your references.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the magazine tweaked
    the typeface or maybe it's their in-house original.\r\nNotice the 'G' is all rounded
    or a perfect circle until it hits the chin.\r\n\r\ngus"

  body: There is an alternate 'G" in Proxima Nova that is close. Click on the 'G'
    in the character set.

  body: Indeed this font was based on Dynamo. We don't use it anymore but all our
    headline fonts are custom-made, albeit in a very amateurish way.. I'd be curious
    to know what typographer think about them...

    post (I'm using an image from issue 11 if that means anything!)\r\n\r\nWhile I
    believe Gus was looking for the name of the smaller face I'm curious what the
    \"HOT\" face is. I realize le car said \"all our headline fonts are custom-made\"
    and that might just apply here. \r\n\r\nAnything would be helpful, thanks guys.\r\n\r\n--\r\ndoom,
