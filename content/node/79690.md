body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am designing a magazine (text set in 2 columns) and
  using Minion Pro at 9pt. \r\nI know the general rule when setting text columns is
  39 characters per line in order to achieve readability, but I also know it depends
  on the font and language.\r\nInDesign's info panel tells me my lines are 53 characters
  long. When I print it out I find it quite easy to read, but maybe it's just me.
  \r\nI also would like to keep the 2 columns setting, because I think it suits the
  theme of the magazine well (short philosophical texts written in an understandable
  manner).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Is it still OK?\r\nDo I need to write more information?
  \r\n\r\nThank You,\r\nk."

  body: The "general rule" is only a guide - good design depends more on what works
    and if it reads easily it is working.

    sometimes not the worst thing for you to be doing,\r\nbut you should do it with
    full intention, not just accidentally --\r\nyou shouldn't use 9-point type for
    anything people should read.\r\n\r\nand making it 11-point type will mean fewer
    characters per inch.\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n\r\np.s.  some convenience stores broadcast
    a high-pitched sound\r\nwhich only youngsters can hear, so they won't loiter at
    the store.\r\nit all boils down to a strategy of targeting the audience you want.\r\n"
