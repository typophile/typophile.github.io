  the typeface name such as [[http://www.exljbris.com/callunasans.html|Calluna Sans]],
  [[http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page|Deja Vu Sans]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/gill-sans/|Gill
  Sans]], [[http://www.identifont.com/show?3RV|Scala Sans]], etc. Being a Canadian,
  sometimes I'm torn between saying /s\xE6nz/ in English or /s\u0251\u0303/ in French.
  Which one???"

    elegant, [s\u0251nz]. Of course, the French pronunciation is arguably more correct,
    as it is a French word. However, it's been accepted into English with an English
    pronunciation in other contexts as well.\r\n\r\nJosh"

    to the influence of Norman French on Old English. And, the OED says the preferred
    pronunciation of <em>insouciance</em>, a pure borrow from French, is the Anglicized
    pronunciation, so go figger..."

  body: "The OED has an entry for \"sans\" where \"sans pareil\", \"sans c\xE9r\xE9monie\"
    etc are mentioned,   but there is a separate entry for sanserif, where there is
    no reference to French. Since I see \"Calluna sans\" as an abbreviation for \"Calluna
    sanserif\", I see no reason to make it sound French."

    sayreef\" would brand you as eccentric or pretentious, unless you were trying
    to get a laugh. I can only recall one person, a client, trying it and it became
    a joke around the office.\r\n"
