body: "Why do most Scotch Roman typefaces not have old-style figures? I've noticed
  that Miller has semi-OSF characters, like a cross-breed with normal lining figures
  (most noticeable in 7 and 9); whereas Mercury and Chronicle from H&FJ do not have
  OSF's. Freight, on the other hand, which strikes me as fairly Scotch in its design,
  DOES have them. Can anyone elucidate this for me? Is it a 19th-century thing? I
  want to use Mercury for an identity project which would involve not just a logo
  but a type system that can be used in-house for publications. I find it odd that
  such an extensive and well-drawn family doesn't have OSF.\r\n\r\nAlso, if anyone
  can suggest a good Scotch Roman that DOES have OSF, that would be wonderful. Thank
  you!"

    has text figures as default and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/ourtype/arnhem_normal_ot/?acs_ss=2">Arnhem</a>
    does as well.

  body: "It's a historical thing. When the scotch roman style was coming into play,
    oldstyle figures were no longer in vogue. Most of the original scotch romans didn't
    have them (or had hybrid figures instead), so most revivals or interpretations
    of the genre tend not to have them either.\r\n\r\nIt's not like there's a biblical
    law that says \"thou shalt not put oldstyle figures in a scotch roman\" or anything,
    it just wasn't common, historically.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Hi Stephen! I'm also known as gramme from NT/QBN, so thanks for the help
    as always. I really like both of those faces. Farnham might be more reasonable
    for the clients' budget. \r\n\r\nThis is for a Presbyterian church, so something
    Scotch Roman (or close to it) seems most appropriate to me.\r\n\r\nThomas, thanks
    for the help as well, that totally makes sense. I might petition H&FJ to add an
    alternate set for Mercury!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nM@"

  body: "Tiffany's quite right: the original release of Caledonia in 1939 did not
    include oldstyle figures. The Linotype supplement from 1948 still does not offer
    any oldstyle figures for the text sizes of Caledonia. \r\n\r\nOddly, however,
    it does show oldstyle figures as an alternate available for Caledonia Bold in
    sizes 16&#150;36. The Bold was originally produced on commission for headlines
    in a NY tabloid newspaper called <cite>P M</cite>. So perhaps the OsFs were part
    of the commission.\r\n\r\nBy 1962, in the tribute to WAD published by the original
    Typophiles, oldstyle figures appear in the showing for Caledonia. \r\n\r\nSo,
    there were OsF in metal eventually, but not until well after the original release.\r\n\r\n--
