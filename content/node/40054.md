  Fontlab? I believe it's 256 characters.\r\n\r\nObviously English, Spanish, French.
  What others?"

  body: "The 'Default' encoding is a Latin 1 implementation, which means it intentionally
    supports majority Western and Scandinavian European languages (incl. Icelandic)
    written in the Latin script. In this case, the definition of Western is political
    rather than geographic and dates from the Cold War period, i.e. Austrian is Western,
    but Czech is not. Minority languages are not well supported by the set, e.g. it
    lacks diacritics for Welsh, Saami, etc.\r\n\r\n"

  body: ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1), ISO 8859-15 (Latin 0, revised from Latin 1 to include
    the Euro sign and Ydierisis), MacRoman, and Windows Latin all contain support
    for most western European languages to varying degrees. Your default encoding
    is likely one of these. English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Swedish, Norwegian,
    Dutch, Danish, and Icelandic are generally covered in these encodings, though
    I think there are a few special accents and digraphs (notably the Dutch IJ and
    ij digraphs) that are missing for full and complete coverage of these languages.
