body: "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nAbout six months ago, I spent several months redesigning a
  broadsheet newspaper, and we purchased Coranto 2 and LFT Etica as the pairing for
  it. I'm extremely happy with it. \r\n\r\nWe use Coranto 2 Headline for headlines
  (and sometimes LFT Etica for smaller story headlines and for all headlines in supplements
  that come with the paper), Coranto 2 for body text, and LFT Etica for things like
  writer bylines, sub-heads, drop quotes, and the like.\r\n\r\nHowever... I can't
  help but feel that LFT Etica is a bit boring. I would like to spice things up a
  bit with a third choice, perhaps for using in things like block heads and under
  photo captions. I don't know why, but I'm envisioning something a bit more square
  and a bit less neutral than LFT Etica \u2013 having flair \u2013 but something that
  looks like it complements Coranto 2 and LFT Etica rather than being something different
  entirely. I would then use this font more liberally in the supplements and perhaps
  in one of the magazines that comes with the paper, but only sparsely in the main
  broadsheet.\r\n\r\nFirstly: is this the done thing? Should I just try and come up
  with a better pairing that Coranto 2/LFT Etica, or is adding in a third choice a
  good move, especially if it complements the other two?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    a large family and many weights \u2013 as it would probably become the main font
    for the supplement and I'd like a lot of variation, but that may be too much to
    ask for."

    compatible in style to one of the two existing ones. It sounds like a better idea
    to replace Etica entirely, if you're sure you no longer like it.\r\n\r\nWhat about
    this?\r\nhttps://monokrom.no/fonts/telefon\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: What Hrant said. Maybe, for added flexibility you could look for something
    with both sans and slab designs (like many of Type Together offerings, for example).

  body: "Thanks for the replies.\r\n\r\nI was afraid you would say that \u2013 and
    deep down, I think you're right. How about if I was to only use two combinations
    at a time? Which I suppose is not what I was looking for, but it's a start. Unfortunately,
    I don't think I could suddenly swap out LFT Etica ... from the broadsheet, anyway.\r\n\r\nFor
    instance, I just spotted [[http://www.type-together.com/index.php?action=portal/viewContent&cntId_content=3029|this
    from Type Together's \"Type in Use\" section]].\r\n\r\nThey use Coranto 2 and
    LFT Etica in the main section, and Bree and Adelle in the other section. I'd like
    a font with some more flair to use with Coranto 2 in the newspaper's supplements,
    and I wouldn't use LFT Etica in them then. But I'd like it to feel like it was
    in the same \"extended family\", if you know what I mean. I don't think Telefon
    is the right fit, although I do love it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A bold slab could be useful.\r\nI went bold in two directions with Pratt
    Nova, both high contrast and slab, which gave the Globe designers lots of options.\r\nhttp://webmedia.newseum.org/newseum-multimedia/dfp/pdf4/CAN_TGAM.pdf\r\n\r\nI
    will be releasing that later in the year.\r\nIn the meantime, I would say look
    for a somewhat condensed slab face, especially one with some thin weights that
    would be useful at large display size in the supplements. Perhaps you might also
    persuade TT to do an ultra-fine version of Coranto for that kind of usage."

    body: "Thanks Nick \u2013 that's really helpful. Pratt Nova is absolutely stunning.
      Was it custom for the Globe?\r\n\r\nWould you also be of the opinion that adding
      a third typeface to the main mix is a bad idea? I would never use it in a way
      that would allow it to <em>compete</em> with the other two fonts. For instance,
      The Observer in the UK has a mix of three going on, but they seem to complement
      each other very well:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.dcscience.net/oberver-020613.jpg\"
      alt=\"Image from the Observer newspaper\" />\r\n\r\nSomehow, I actually think
      this could be fine.\r\n\r\nAnd that is a slab, too."

  body: "Thanks for the kind words, Edmund.\r\nYes, Pratt was custom for the Globe.\r\nI
    originally published it commercially in 2009, but in a subsequent redesign we
    made substantial changes and additions (hence the \u201CNova\u201D apellation),
    which I have not yet updated in the commercial release.\r\n\r\nYes, I do think
    that a third style can complement a sans+serif main combo, and a slab can do the
    trick.\r\nBut these days, I see no reason not to use something more exotic, a
    rounded style or a script for instance, perhaps distressed.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    the key is to provide suf\uFB01cient contrast in style (caps \u2013 lower case
    \u2013 italic), size, weight and even colour, between the typefaces."

    body: "Nick, those words were more honest than \"kind\" \u2013 the typography
      in the Globe really makes me envious.\r\n\r\nI think you give some fantastic
      advice there: I am searching for good rounded and slab matches. Any suggestions
      would be appreciated. I think a script would be a bit too much for me to take,
      although I agree the consideration has some merit.\r\n\r\nThe most important
      bit is the sufficient contrast \u2013 that really is key.\r\n\r\nReading your
      earlier post above again, I was surprised your mention of an \"ultra fine\"
      Coranto commission didn't bring our own custom work to my mind. While it may
      not be ultra fine, we did a lighter version in house of Coranto for some of
      our section heads:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/customexample_3650.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
      am sure though you may not be impressed with some of the aspects like the kerning
      and our quick-turnaround custom job (it was done in a few days just before we
      launched our redesign), because I haven't been back to fix some of the problems
      that irk me since, but it has served us well.\r\n\r\nOnce again, thanks everyone
      for your help!"
