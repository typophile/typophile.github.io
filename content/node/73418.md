body: "Cheers,\r\nI'm doing a small font family in Fontlab 5, now containing a Regular,
  Light, Bold and Heavy weight. I did the Regular and used the vfb as a template for
  the Light, Bold and Heavy. I filled the Font Info on all four vfbs with the help
  of the green Diamond.\r\n\r\nMy four generated otf files are all recognised in my
  font management software MainType. But when I load any or all of them, Adobe InDesign
  CS4 only shows the Regular in the font menu. In addition, it doesn't really seem
  to be the Regular at all, because if you e.g. just load the Heavy in MainType, InDesign
  uses the Heavy with the name Regular displayed.\r\n\r\nI googled around but I just
  couldn't find a solution. I just want to cry, why doesn't it work? Please help me
  out!\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"

  body: "http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/322/322050.html lists 12 different ways of \"repairing\"
    fonts that cause problems.\r\nTry deleting all AdobeFnt*.lst files you can find
    -- it's possible an earlier test-run of your font got cached somewhere. Deleting
    these files (the * can be any number) is of no consequence to your system, they
    are just Adobe's own personal brand of font cache data and will be rebuilt next
    time you start one of Adobe's applications."

  body: Have a look at Karsten's [[http://kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.htm|Font Naming]]
    pdf. Fontnuke is great for clearing font caches (a tip that I got from... Karsten).

  body: "If you install a regular weight that has naming problems it can cause Indesign
    to handle all other fonts in the family incorrectly <em>until you install a correctly
    named regular weight</em>. Don\u2019t trust the green diamond; when setting up
    your font naming base them on a working family (just open up some Adobe fonts
    and see how they do it). Start with a regular weight and then add fonts one at
    a time fixing problems with each one as you go.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, generate
    the fonts from FontLab directly into the \u201C/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts\u201D
    directory. Never install your test fonts using any other utilities or by putting
    them into the system fonts directory or you\u2019ll get into a cycle of cache
    cleaning and rebooting that can go on for hours. Only install fonts to test your
    final retail fonts and your life will be much easier. I don\u2019t install a font
    on a Mac until I\u2019ve already cleared it with FontQA, Microsoft\u2019s font
    testing tool, and the entire family works in Adobe apps and on my Windows machine."

  body: While Mr Puckett's advice is sound, I've found that as long as you change
    the version number with each font generation, all of these font cache issues go
    away. And you can install the font via any font app you like. FWIW.

    Thanks for your answers!
