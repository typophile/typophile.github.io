body: "hello.\r\n\r\nI have tried my best figure this alone but it escapes me. (Mac
  fontlab4.5) Here what I'm doing...\r\nI made all my kerning in the metrics window
  and it shows up in the kerning information & opentype panels. I then go to the kerning
  assistance and applied and saved. When I make the font (.otf) the kern feature is
  either beside it or no where to be found. Which ever the case the font has none
  of the pairs I have made. I have noticed that there many different check boxes and
  dialogs but not sure which ones I need to be for or against. I have tried several
  methods  by reading through the forums but I keep getting the same results. Should
  I not be playing with features and using something else maybe? \r\n\r\nAll I want
  is to have my kerning pairs included inside the fontname.otf file. Is this possible?
  Can anyone help me with a checklist or steps to get what seems like a basic operation?\r\nThanks
  for your help and sorry if this is too beginner-ish of a question\r\n\r\nAllen"

  body: "Allen, \r\n\r\nI believe earlier versions of FontLab had problems when \"kern\"
    was the only feature in the font. Do you have other features? (Like \"liga\").
    Do you open the generated .otf back in FontLab and find that the kerning is not
    included, or do you test in an application? If so, what system and application?
    \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Adam,\r\n\r\nI am in OSX and saving them to the adobe fonts folder in application
      support. The test is Illustrator but have tried everything and get nothing.
      I did reopen them into fontlab and the kerning there however the words \"latin\"
      in red now appear and the list is in a strange order.\r\n\r\nIs the process
      I am going about to get kerning in my font correct?\r\n\r\nI noticed there a
      discussion where someone said basic kerning tables are not recognized in opentype.
      Made me more confroozed. What's this? \r\n\r\nIf there is a problem should adding
      an extra feature solve it?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help thus far\r\n\r\nAllen"
