  body: Does anyone know of comparable ones? In other words, something similar? I
    like the thicks and thins of this one. I can't find anything that is close (so
    far)...

  body: It isn't something you should want to license, it isn't an actual font. The
    thicks and thins you are seeing are because, as Tiffany suggested, it has been
    squooshed. You could do a search for "stressed sans" at myfonts and find something
    better.
