  body: 'Luciano, the text samples in the PDF look very good, indicating that the
    lowercase is in a good state. Can you provide some text in a language that uses
    the letter k? This is the only lowercase letter that looks a little weak. The
    lower left stroke of the g looks a bit dark compared to the top, diagonal stroke
    of the lower bowl: try transferring just a little weight between these strokes.
    <BR> <BR>The uppercase has some weight problems: Z, in particular, is very heavy
    compared to the other letters. Also try making the stem of the J just very slight
    lighter: it looks darker than the other vertical stems because it is longer. I
    like the large bowl of the P very much. The middle of the S is a bit heavy. <BR>
    <BR>Can you provide a few lines of text set in all uppercase? In the image above
    and the PDF the baseline overshoot of the C looks extreme, but that may be the
    effect of seeing it between the B and D.'

    on this style. Some of your glyphs are very beautiful. <BR> <BR>Some things: <BR>Your
    vertical proportions are very good &#40;especially for magazine setting&#41;.
    <BR>The caps are maybe too small. Making them wider is probably best. <BR>The
    &#34;a&#34; and &#34;g&#34; are too wide. <BR>I&#39;d remove the middle serif
    from the &#34;w&#34;. <BR>The &#34;G&#34; is too wide. <BR>The &#34;M&#34; needs
    work. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t looked at the spacing yet. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: The k looks okay in text, although you could very slightly lower the connection
    to the upright and make the top diagonal arm reach a little bit further to the
    right. <BR> <BR>Randy is right about the horizontals in the uppercase, but don&#39;t
    make them too thin. <BR> <BR>The overshoot of the C looks okay in the all caps
    setting. The overshoot of the D could be reduced by a couple of units top and
    bottom. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t necessarily agree with Hrant and Eduardo about making
    the caps wider. I&#39;m looking at what seems to me a very attractive magazine
    face, and in that context I think the narrow caps are a good thing. If you make
    a book version of the face, that would be when to make the caps wider. However,
    the K should be a bit wider and the G a bit narrower.

  body: The new k looks very good. <BR> <BR>I think the middle apex of both W and
    w can be higher, especially in the uppercase. <BR> <BR>Making versions for different
    sizes is an excellent idea. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking forward to seeing an italic.

    and &#34;k&#34; need work. I haven&#39;t looked at the italic, but it seems like
    it will have trouble standing out enough &#40;as emphasis&#41; - try making it
    slightly lighter. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
