    doesn't have the texture, but it has the vigor. You might dig <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/borges_lettering/sarah_script_regular/\">Sarah
    Script</a> too, though it's certainly more contemporary.\r\n\r\nif it's the rough
    finish you're after, have a look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/sudtipos/oxida_ot/\">Oxida</a>."
