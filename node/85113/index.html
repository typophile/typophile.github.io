  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

I'm doing an identity for a post-rock/heavy/prog band.  I don't really know what I'm asking other than are there any good starting points when looking for the correct typeface or typefaces to inspire me.  I want to make a really solid and iconic logo that won't look tacky or dated at any point.  I need it to be t-shirt worthy basically.  Any advice would be much appreciated. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>Post-rock</em>: uh. Postdated? Queen? (Happy 65th Birthday Freddy Mercury!)

<em>Heavy</em> is from Heavy Metal, i.e., two or three lead guitars, lots of percussion, and loud, raspy voices.

<em>Prog</em> is short for "progressive rock", which is sort of a sidetrack of "classic" rock & metal. "Classic" metal (the loudness alluded to above) is sort of retro -- think Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and (gosh) their poppier cousins Bon Jovi and Europe. Nowadays, metal falls under Speed (a.k.a. "Thrash") metal (System of a Down, Metallica), Nu-metal (thrashier than thrash -- Slipknot), and my current favourite flavour: Progressive, i.e., melodious songs, more often than not heavy on the bass, but with lighter foreground notes. Nothing weird in encountering the odd cross-over with country or blues. Examples: Opeth, Ayreon, Within Temptation, Tool.

(Note that discussions of metal are as open to feverish argumentation as everything else, taste-wise.)

I would not recommend the usual Heavy Metal treatment for a prog-rock band -- please, no Blackletter! Perhaps a clean, straight font would work, something like Copperplate Bold. I reckon the actual band name is also of importance ...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Somebody on Typophile who knows what prog is! Awesome, Theunis :-)
To me (and I'm no expert by any means) the «progressive» qualifier is mostly one of (1) more open song structure, i.e. often a departure from the classic 3- to 5-minute stanza/refrain pattern into more open, often long and meandering and more or less complex compositions that can also often (2) cross over between different genres, as Theunis has hinted at. Much progressive metal and especially progressive rock (bands like Porcupine Tree come to mind) refer back more or less strongly to the progressive/psychedelic rock of the early 70s (think Dark Side of the Moon, or what Pink Floyd did on Atom Heart Mother, for an «extremum point» of that direction).

Post-rock: The way I understand it, refers to music that uses classic rock instrumentation but departs from rock song structures. Often droney, ambient-ish, experimental. 

I think this overall field of music is very open and sort-of fuzzy by definition, and it's hard to offer blanket design advice. Would be interesting to know more about the band in question – how heavy is it, how experimental, how melodic, how strong are the classic prog / '70s psychedelic leanings, etc; how complex is the music, and would you prefer to hint at this complexity in the design, or create a clean counterpart? Depending on these questions it could really be anywhere from very clean sans-serif to blackletter, also depending on how you combine it with artwork (will you also be doing album sleeves?).
Any chance of listening samples?
Sexy project in any case. Damn, I'd want one of these! :-)

<cite>«please, no Blackletter»</cite>

Oh, I don't think that can be said as a general statement at all. The <a href="http://www.guitarmessenger.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Opeth-Logo.jpg">Opeth logo</a> is one of my favorite band logos out there (though I may be biased since I just love the music to bits), works beautifully, fits the music (and artwork and overall design) beautifully, and is very blackletter. And they're prog metal, at least most of the time :-).
I'd rather have said no Copperplate – sorry. That's not fresh enough in my book. </div>
