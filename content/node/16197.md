body: "Urgent because if there's not any solution, i would be obliged to choose something
  else. I'm wanting to use Mayo dingborders (http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/mayo.asp)
  for the subtitles, in a layout, and xpress get me in trouble. Mayo form words into
  borders and pressing space nor\xF9ally create a blank border; but in xpress, it
  does not, putting instead a normal space... is there a solution* to force the log
  to use the font settings in the mayo formed words ?\r\n\r\n*Other than using Indesign.
  I would have prefered a lot, but xpress was installed in the computer when i arrived
  for the job, and the paper is too poor to buy Indesign only to please me and my
  ideas of opentyped fool titles and good typography."

  body: Hmm. Have you tried using option-space instead? In most fonts, this is identical
    to the space, except how it is treated by applications. Some programs assume that
    the regular space character is blank and only use the width. I'm not sure why.
    In these cases, the non-breaking space (option-space) may work.
