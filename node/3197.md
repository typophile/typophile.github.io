  body: Thanx Mike. I&#39;m currently switching computers at work &#40;my first  <BR>generation
    beige G3 is retiring!&#41; and as a result I&#39;m even more  <BR>confused then
    I usually am. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> I should&#39;ve given this tip earlier  <BR>but didn&#39;t want to appear
    useless. I couldn&#39;t have known this  <BR>tiny bit of info was enough for you
    to nail it. Good job!
