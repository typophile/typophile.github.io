  ideas about this typeface, my initial thoughts were something close to Gill Sans
  but some characters (the lowercase 't' in particular) are dramatically different...\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be much appreciated!"

  body: It is Gill Sans with so-called infant characters. Look for either Gill Schoolbook
    or Gill Educational.

  body: Great thanks! There are still some discrepancies with the lowercase 't' though?
    I've never heard of this Scoolbook version of Gill before I've tried in vain to
    find more resource about it, does anyone know of any further reading around this
    face?
