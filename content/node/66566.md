  body: Incidentally, this isn't an IBM typeface. It was made available for the IBM
    Selectric typewriter by GP, which also made elements for some of the more popular
    IBM typefaces, but at a lower price. GP also made such things for the Selectric
    that IBM didn't offer as an astrology element and an Old English element (they
    even also made one for the Selectric Composer).

  body: Thanks Florian.  Your examples have the same general shape as Report, but
    one difference that jumps out at me is that in all these example fonts (described
    in layman's terms by a non-typographist [i.e. me]), all the lines in the characters
    are exactly the same thickness, whereas in Report they are weighted differently
    within individual characters.  I think that very factor is what has always given
    it the eye appeal for me.

    contrast, or stroke modulation. Do you have a larger sample?

  body: "The smudge factor, of course, is an artifact of hand-typing using a flaky
    carbon ribbon onto not-so-great paper, one level of 1980s-quality xerox copying,
    then scanning at 600 dpi, that is then highly compressed into a jpeg file so the
    site would accept the upload, and then over-magnified for display here.  In other
    words, it isn't supposed to be smudged, but clean.  Saving the jpeg file off and
    shrinking the display down to something more reasonable might give a better feel
    for the overall general typeface appearance.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I did see a lot
    of Magda-like typewriter copy during the same general era (70s-80s) in various
    paper newsletters to which I was subscribed, almost all from Europe.  That particular
    typeface didn't seem to catch on as well here in the 'States."

  body: "Hi there; I'm the creator behind the SV Basic Manual font. In fact, it is
    one of my very first attempts at drawing a font, and it probably shows. I did
    not personally own a typewriter with this font (and thus I was not aware of its
    name), but I had a computer manual written with it. A particularly important problem
    was that at the time I did not own a scanner; however, I had access to a fax and
    a modem, and so I managed to get a bitmap template by faxing to my computer! Obviously,
    the resolution was very limiting, and some of the subtleties were no doubt lost.\r\n\r\n(The
    more recent update, version 1.1, included vowels with ogonek, since that was requested.
    I don't remember doing any other improvements.)\r\n\r\nI can not make any promises,
    but it would indeed be interesting to attempt to redo the digitization from scratch,
    now that I have a high-resolution scanner, and perhaps at least a little more
    experience with vector drawing. To that end, if anyone could donate high resolution
    scans of a, preferably, first generation document, I would be very grateful: in
    particular, I need examples of @|\u2022\xBD\xBC\xB2\xB3\xB6\xA7\u2020, which did
    not appear in my manual; also (if they exist) _\\`^~, as well as any other rare
    characters.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I'm afraid the current version will have to
    suffice. I'm not aware of any other digitization of \"Report\".\r\n"

    a high resolution scan (preferably at least 600 DPI); you can mail it to johan.winge@telia.com

  body: "Oh, I see; thanks anyway!\r\n\r\nI have now done some research, and it seems
    that the 1980's BASIC manual that I had as my template when I made the SV Basic
    Manual font most likely was printed with a Swedish Facit typewriter. According
    to the typewriter experts I consulted, this particular font was very common with
    the Facit typewriters, if not the standard during this period, and it went under
    the name \"Cubic 10/12 FA 46\". As edo_nick rightly points out, it is not exactly
    identical to Report; most notably, the numeral \"1\" looks like the letter \"l\"
    in Report, but in Cubic it is different. (Curiously though, the glyph \"\xBD\"
    in Cubic has the \"l\" shape; yet it is not identical to the \xBD of Report, for
    that one has a slanted solidus, while that of Cubic is horizontal.)\r\n\r\nEvidently,
    it was not at all uncommon that different typewriter manufacturers had similar
    fonts, which all differed in some small details. For example Triumph-Adler has
    a font named \"Prestige-Cubic\", which is identical to Report in some respects,
    and to Facit's Cubic in others; yet it has a \"W\" and \"w\" which are wider at
    the bottom than those of either Report or Cubic.\r\n\r\nI have now acquired a
    nice specimen from the Facit typewriter, which I intend to digitize. (And so replace
    SV Basic Manual, which I already regard as deprecated.) I guess that with an alternative
    glyph shape for \"1\" it will pass as a remake of Report as well. If the administrators
    agree, I will start a separate thread in the Critique forum, where I'll discuss
    this digitisation process.\r\n"

  body: Of course! By the way, the big sample you posted (about Vera Tolstoy) seems
    to be written in what I suppose to be a true Report -- it is certainly different
    in many subtle ways from the Cubic that I have. Is that really written with your
    unidentified Facit typewriter? Or has it another origin?
