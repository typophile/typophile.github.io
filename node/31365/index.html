<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi everyone
I am a 3rd year graphic design student working on a project where I am redesigning some beer labels for a brewery. I want to modernize their labels, and I am in doubt if I should modernize their logo as well. I do not want make any major changes to it, but maybe give it a facelift, or a more modern up to date look.
Does anyone have any suggestions for how this could be done, or what I should be looking for, what makes the logo look outdated and could be changed? Or does the logo look good as it is?
Any suggestions or thoughts?
Thanks
Carl Herup

<div class=commentbody>Experience is a highly valued trait in beer marketing, and a nostalgic looking logo that evokes the deep history of the brewery is highly desirable. Modernism for modernism's sake is a bad idea for beer, except in rare cases for absolutely new brands and styles. There is, however, plenty of room for improvement in this logo here.
First off, it looks like it says "Restrooms" at first glance. There isn't much you can do about this without convincing the company to change the name, but at least it evokes another idea associated with beer.
The tail of the R seems rather heavy and inelegant, but it should remain in some way so as to not disturb the brand too much. Gently curving and tapering the understroke might be enough. The rest of the letters might benefit by switching them to a more fluidly connected script font, rather than the italic currently in use.
Whatever you wind up doing, the key elements of the brand appear to be the big green R and diagonal stripe extending from it. You can probably get away with anything else, including reshaping those elements, so long as those things are included.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Is that part of the assignment? I doubt in a real life situation that it would be. But then again, part of the fun of being a student is that you don't have those rules to restrain you (its also part of the challenge).
One option might be to use the current logo, but in a new way.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Both R and r are hideous, but at least the big one could work with some heavy tweaking. The tail on t needs to go, too-these letters aren't script! Last, ff should be a ligature without a slant, and might look better connected to the swash below.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Uff yeah. I was born and raised in Faroe Islands so I grew up with that ugly logo before my eyes.
I'd give it a good tweek :)

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the good comments.
I have made a few changes to the logo, but as mentioned earlier I do not want to change it too much, but rather improve it. I am not too sure what could be done with big R? What do you think?

<div class=commentbody>Both of your revisions are big improvements on the original (my preference is for #2, except the curl of the R tail looks better in #1), but what I meant to say earlier (I thought I did, in a jumbled up way) is that while a big green "R" with a heavy diagonal stripe are identifying features of the brand, it doesn't necessarily have to be the <em>same</em> "R" as what you're starting with. It probably should remain something scripty/swashy, but try other styles to see how they work.</div>
