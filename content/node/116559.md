body: "Dear friends\r\nIm not enough experienced with FontLab and I need some help.
  Im facing the following problem while working in InDesign (CS6 - v.8.0.2, MacOSX
  10.9.2). OpenType fonts with Greek ligatures do not show old texts correctly when
  OT features are enabled, in contrast with texts typed from scratch.\r\n\r\nOld/new
  text\r\nLanguage: Greek \r\nLigatures: enabled\r\nResult: no ligatures\r\n___________________________\r\nOld
  text\r\nLanguage: English \r\nLigatures: enabled\r\nResult: corrupted text with
  ligatures\r\n___________________________\r\nNew text\r\nLanguage: English \r\nLigatures:
  enabled\r\nResult: ligatures ok\r\n\r\nHas anyone encountered also this problem?
  Is this an Adobe or a FontLab issue? Any help or suggestion will be very much welcomed.
  Thank you very much in advance!\r\n\r\nKonstantinos Siskakis\r\nThessaloniki, Greece\r\n"

  body: "Perhaps something very basic. If the old text does not use Unicode encoding,
    then the ligatures will not work, since the pieces being looked for do not exist,
    as far as the program knows.\r\n\r\nA bit more subtle would be if you've used,
    say, \"theta\" for a name, but your statements use the Unicode index, or vice
    versa.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\nsub pi omicron upsilon by pi_omicron_upsilon;\r\n\r\nwon't
    work if pi, omicron, or upsilon are *named* uni030c, uni03BF or uni03C5 in your
    \"old text\" document. Or even if just one of them is.\r\n\r\nFor debugging, I'd
    start assuming something like that, since you're getting scrambled text in English
    as well. An encoding issue. Remember, FontLab is quite literal, it won't equate
    a name with a Unicode index within a feature statement, and it won't make the
    substitution in a text (old or new) if the encoding isn't in the precise form
    it expects.\r\n"

    text files, same font files? We're getting beyond my expertise here, but I'd say,
    then, it might be language tags. Significant changes in how those interact with
    CS4 and CS6, I believe. But that shouldn't scramble the English. We don't use
    language tags in our shop, but of course it is a closed system.\r\n\r\nJust to
    make sure: You have exactly the same text files, and exactly the same font files.
    Everything is fine using CS4, not fine with CS6. (And you're not using the World
    Composer with text set as right to left in CS6... No, that'd be noticeable.)"

  body: "OK. I had misunderstood. I took your original post to mean the ligatures
    were not working -- that is, were not forming. Everything I wrote was based on
    that (incorrect) assumption.\r\n\r\nFor what is actually going on with the two
    files, someone would likely have to sit down with everything to de-bug. All FontLab
    will do is let you see the code used for forming the ligatures. Why there is extra
    space may be due to something in the OT features, but without everything available
    for examination, one just can't tell. And of course, that may not be the source
    of the problem."

  body: "I am guessing that maybe the features are not correctly registered to all
    the writing systems in the font? Perhaps the \"old texts\" are existing document
    files that are tagged in the app as being Greek, and thus triggering processing
    of only the Greek features. The \"new texts\" may not have any particular language
    assigned and hence, work fine using default processing.\r\n\r\nForgive me if this
    is already well-understood and not what is happening here."
