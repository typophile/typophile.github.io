  body: DTL Argo is very close but I found a clear picture of the same logo. I appreciate
    your expertise, thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Race-for-the-Cure-2010_3777.jpg]
    Definately custom r, not a great job. But that grotesque cap 'R' and registered
    symbol makes me wonder what font it is! Oh wait, thats a different font for "FOR
    THE" and the reg. symbol of course.

  body: "Renko -- brilliant -- I believe it is DTL Argo Med Ital with custom 'r' and
    the terminals of the a, n, m and u cut off. k cut down and g made out of a cap
    G.\r\n\r\nStill not sure of the font of \"FOR THE\" and \"\xAE\". Very close to
    Antique Olive Ital, but not the right 'R.'\r\n\r\nThanks very much. Argo is a
    beautiful font."
