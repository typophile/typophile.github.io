body: "Just wondering your thoughts on this Klimax face and its usage. It is very
  intriguing at large sizes (and indeed it is meant for display) but anything close
  to what typophile is using it for and it turns to mush. \r\n\r\nIs there anyone
  who has used this font yet or can testify to its success in their own work? Appreciated.\r\n\r\n-Jesse\r\n\r\n"

    boring or mundane. Just more quickly readable.

    changed again. Stan, just clear your cache.\r\n\r\nGotta say, I was actually digging
    on Klimax. But yeah, readability is not it's strong suit."

  body: 'Kent: I think it would have worked with the the light, or ''Minus'', weight.
    But I can see why they chose to use the black version, since that is more of a
    novelty. The light is more ''normal''. I agree that the black weight didn''t work
    particularly well on typophile. It looked ok on the frontpage, but the headers
    above the forums were just too small for the tiny counters in the black weight.'

  body: "I'd be interested to see how the smaller headers rendered for you, Quincunx.
    We did some tests at a variety of sizes before publishing Klimax here, and even
    at a tiny 30px I could see the counters quite clearly.\r\n\r\nThis conversation
    often comes up when the Featured Face changes. Some people prefer personality
    over readability, and vice versa. We can't always please everyone equally, unfortunately,
    but perhaps one day in a magical world, users can choose their own* :)\r\n\r\n*anyone
    want to volunteer dev time? ;)\r\n"

    be pretty nifty if, by clicking on a \"try!\" button on the featured face banners,
    you could sample the text for yourself on the whole site. "

  body: "<em>\"We can\u2019t always please everyone equally, unfortunately, but perhaps

    in a word for continuing to mercilessly expose all of us to the same face for
    a week! I think it's great compulsory New Font Exposure. I've had initial reservations
    about a featured face a couple of times, but then it grew on me during its week;
    and sometimes the opposite. I suspect if I could choose another font anytime,
    I'd probably switch faces more than actually read Typophile.\r\n\r\nBtw, Klimax
    (Plus) must have the craziest sexiest \"g\" since I don't know what."
