body: "I have been butting heads with my lead developer lately about how much and
  how often we should use our brand-approved web fonts. These fonts are Benton Modern
  and Benton Sans. I would like to maybe even use these fonts for all type on the
  site instead of trying to pair them with Arial and Georgia. My developer is pushing
  back because of load time. He'll say \"that's a lot of text for a web font\"\u2014wanting
  to only reserve the web font for special instances. \r\n\r\nI was under the impression,
  that once you load a webfont, it's loaded. It wouldn't matter how much you use it
  within the page. That it would load as fast if you use it for one word, or 1,000
  words. We do have a very large site, which is editorial-based with lots of content
  and I certainly wouldn't want to slow the site down. \r\n\r\nWhat is everyone's
  experience with using web fonts? Use them pervasively or sparingly? "

  body: There are load time issues for very large CJK fonts or any font files containing
    a large character set but I would assume that once it has loaded you should be
    good to go regardless of how much text is being rendered.

  body: I agree with Mr. Finkelstein. And it would only take about 60 seconds to set
    up two pages (one with the web font and one without) to be able to run some load
    time tests, so have the developer do that so you can prove him wrong.

    answer. You need to test different sizes and browsers and see how the webfont
    performs, especially in copy text. If you texts become less legible than when
    set in Arial or Georgia, you might not want to use them in certain sizes. "

  body: "At [[http://www.webtype.com|Webtype]], we optimize the rendering of our fonts
    for both legibility and loading time and we also offer the ability to subset by
    character set to improve performance further. Many of our customers use Webtype
    for their entire sites and haven't noticed any performance issues. For example,
    check out [[http://www.loewe.tv/int|Loewe]], which uses 5 variations of Benton
    Sans.\r\n\r\nAlso, we offer several versions of Benton Sans and Benton Modern
    specifically designed from the ground up to be used at small sizes--[[http://www.webtype.com/font/bentonsansre-family/|Benton
    Sans RE]] and [[http://www.webtype.com/font/bentonmodern-re-family/|Benton Modern
    RE]]--from the [[http://www.fontbureau.com/ReadingEdge/|Reading Edge]] series.
    Many customers pairs these with the display-sized versions of Benton Sans/Modern
    on their sites.\r\n\r\nFinally, we offer a free, 30-day trial for any font from
    our catalog--you can try them yourself and see if you notice any performance issues.
    If you have any specific questions, feel free to reach out to me directly: paley@webtype.com\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Yes. If you are using the font in one place on a page, using it everywhere
    on the page will engender zero additional load time. I don't know the details
    of Webtype's back end, but if it's like ours at WebINK, if they encounter the
    font anywhere on the site, it is loaded once and remains cached. In our case,
    for up to a month.\r\n\r\nSo no, performance is almost certainly not a reason
    to not use your web fonts more widely. It will help you avoid the dog's breakfast
    problem you have now where you are using four different typefaces. Ick."
