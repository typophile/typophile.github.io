  body: If you decide to redraw it, I reckon each crown is a 4x3. The lower vertices
    then appear to fall at the golden section. The whole thing (ie all 3 crowns) fit
    onto a 12x8 rectangle.

    PDF in Illustrator, and copy the logo in vectors from it.\r\n\r\nBecause I'm so
    nice, I have done just that. Shall I upload it somewhere?\r\nOr if you want to
    do it yourself.. :)\r\n\r\nedit:\r\nThough I'm not sure if such a thing is allowed,
    reading that regulations and such."

  body: I think Saab used three crowns as part of their logo at some point in their
    history. Not sure about right now.
