  had an idea that, so far, has proven popular among typographic types: Cleaning Trajan.
  \r\n\r\nThe typeface is probably one of the oldest, dating back to the Roman Era
  (but not one of the oldest fonts), \r\nthe trouble I find with using Trajan at large
  sizes is that many of the glyphs appear uneven and raggedy through\r\na combination
  of it having been translated to computer before the modern day wizardry we have
  access to today\r\nand the age of the typeface itself. Though I suspect that the
  guy who first carved this typeface was very, very \r\nprecise about it. \r\n\r\nSo
  my intention is to re-do the outline and tidy it up a bit. I'm not sure if this
  has already been done, but it's \r\nbeen fun to do so far. \r\nI'm already receiving
  positive feedback and critique from some of the communities I inhabit and the two\r\nattachments
  are pre-feedback, but it gives you a general idea. \r\n"

    the letters. Your T looks kinda bloodless to me.

    just about the letter itself. \r\n\r\n@riccard0, I thought that too, but then
    I considered that that was probably for finished typefaces. "

    quite (as you can see browsing the threads). \r\nSure, having at least 26 letters
    helps giving more insightful advice."

    in 1989.\r\nYou won't get very far by tweaking the Adobe outlines.\r\nThe Trajan
    typeface is only one interpretation of the Trajan\u2019s Column lettering.\r\nIf
    you are serious about this, you should start from scratch by analyzing the original
    lettering, assimilating and synthesizing the letter shapes, and working out a
    system of serif treatment that is appropriate for a particular size, or at different
    sizes.\r\nOne of the reasons that Twombly's Trajan has been so successful is that
    its serifs <em>are</em> micro-detailed and small in proportion, making it suitable
    for display setting.\r\n\r\nYou are misusing the term \"modern\"\u2014in type
    it generally means either a Didone, or related to 20th century modernism, whereas
    what you are after is merely \"clean\".\r\nHere's a clean Roman capital:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/senatus-bq/"

  body: "As Nick said, there are many different interpretations of the letters on
    the Trajan Column out there, as well as letters inspired by roman inscribed lettering
    on buildings and monuments. They all focus on different aspects, some are more
    calligraphic, some more sculptural, some more clean whilst taking the basic shape
    of the letters. If you would be interested in doing a new interpretation of Trajan
    it would be better not to start from an existing interpretation. Rather have a
    look at the original letters. As these letters were chiseled into stone there
    is variation among the letters. Also you could have a look at the various interpretations
    already out there. Two the top of my head:\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/goudy-trajan/|Goudy
    Trajan]]\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/jupiter-pro/|Jupiter]]\r\n\r\nAnd
    there are many that share its spirit but take more liberties with the original,
    echoing the original more in feel than in exact design.\r\n"

    different interpretation, with a pen influence as opposed to "brush/chisel."

    has historical blah blah and there are many fine interpretations etc. For the
    general public, it might be more familiar as the official font of every movie
    poster ever. Byington was commissioned by Roxio for use in DVD titles, back when
    video interlace flicker was an issue, hence the chunkular, totally flat serifs.
    The proportions of most of the caps were drawn over photos of the column engravings.
    The lowercase, numerals are Sabon/Garamondesque; mostly modular with some relation
    to the caps."
