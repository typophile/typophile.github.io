		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;@fontface&rdquo; is a declaration in CSS* that allows a specific font which may not be on a viewer&rsquo;s machine to be loaded along with the web page and thus allow a web page to display text rendered in something other than &ldquo;web-safe&rdquo; default fonts &ndash; as a font, not as an image.</p>
<p>Different browsers have different implementations of this @fontface declaration, supporting different font formats, etc.</p>
<p>Web designers find it cumbersome and a nuisance to keep track of all the different variations in code and formats to address the idiosyncrasies of different browsers that their viewers may be using. It is also confusing and frustrating for well-intentioned designers to understand which, if any, of the fonts they have or want will allow such a use as part of a font vendor&rsquo;s End User License Agreement (EULA).</p>
<p>On the other side of the equation, most vendors do not have licensing models for allowing use of their fonts for this kind of web &ldquo;embedding.&rdquo; Most are reluctant to allow this use because some of the current browsers only support @fontface with &ldquo;naked&rdquo; fonts (i.e., the same OpenType or TrueType font format that can be installed directly on a desktop machine and used for any other purpose) and the security against these fonts being rather inadvertently or innocently acquired and used elsewhere is minimal.</p>
<p>Enter TypeKit (among others) as a service. They arrange with foundries to offer typefaces for use as web fonts (taking advantage of @fontface to serve up fonts to the web page). They host the font files on their own server and take pains to obfuscate the location and the contents of those files in various ways, to add a layer of security against misappropriation that their partner foundries accept.</p>
<p>Web designers who subscribe to the service select from the fonts on offer and are provided with copy-and-paste code that allows them to utilize these fonts in their web pages via CSS stylesheets, without having to worry about the details of the evolving technology and with confidence that they are correctly licensed. Typekit takes care of making sure that various browsers are served the appropriate formats in such a way that maximum compatibility and consistency is provided for the design.</p>
<p>Essentially TypeKit is building a bridge between web designers and font vendors by taking care of the messy muddle in the middle in terms of both technology and licensing ins and outs.</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;ve stated this clearly for you and that my understanding does an adequate job of representing the essence of the situation.</p>
<p>Others can correct any oversimplifications or add any essential elements that I&rsquo;ve skipped.</p>

<p>[Edit]: * Sorry, I forgot to explain: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used hand-in-hand with HTML for formatting and styling web pages.</p>

<p>Cool. First time I had seen type kit in use. And it does work on IE7.0.5 on Windows. A second of display in the default serif, and then it pops into the correct faces. (I wonder if the delay is server related, and if it will grow longer if the service becomes popular.)</p>

<p>Very little lag - a second at most on my set up. But any lag makes me think people might start putting Web fonts on the metrics of the core fonts to reduce the reflow-flicker when the fonts load in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>So it lets a web designer use a font that s/he owns, and a user can see it even if that don’t have it installed?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost. It lets a web designer use a font that s/he licenses for use from the font service, like Typekit, even though the user doesn&rsquo;t have it installed in their operating system.</p>
<p>On a technical level, it works similarly to the way block ads - like the ones for Font Bureau here at Typophile - are included in the page. Similar principal except instead of including a link to block ad images, the link is to font data. Both are handled by Javascript that creates the HTML and CSS necessary to link to the correct resource on the fly as the page loads in the browser.</p>

<p>Simon, it depends on whether they are trying to serve some fonts to all IE, or some IE with some fonts, and some IE with other fonts. Is that clear?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s &lsquo;interoperability&rsquo;. If they or anyone told their foundry clients the whole situation before they made licensing agreements, I&rsquo;d be pleasantly shocked.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re awake &lsquo;over there&rsquo;, Simon, can you point me to a web site that serves an Embeddable OpenType font (that is the same as an Embedded Opentype font, except that since it&rsquo;s never embedded, I remain tense correct), with more than 256 glyphs in the EOT?</p>
<p>And I apologize to anyone, &lsquo;in-the-know&rsquo; who knows that EOT does not generally contain any OT if it&rsquo;s going to work in all IE. 
But they/we still cannot change the name of EOT fast enough for these discussions. ;)</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I’m certain we can help them adjust their CFF -&gt; TTF -&gt; EOT conversion process to improve the rendering in IE.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a big problem that I&rsquo;m still trying to find answers to. I have spent good money on OTF CFF fonts that look like hell in Windows no matter what I do. And I am not automatically assigning blame to Windows, either. Safari&rsquo;s rendering of body text drives me nuts, so I&rsquo;m not a big fan of their approach to rasterizing within Windows, either.
John Hudson quite graciously took the time to explain to me the fundamental differences between TT and CFF but how do we bridge the gap with regard to web fonts?
I might email you on this one, Simon, and soon.
What &ldquo;help&rdquo; might be on the way?</p>

<p>Actually I think it&rsquo;s the <em>biggest</em> problem - once you get the whole licensing thing out of the way.</p>
<p>In Windows CFF fonts are generally rendered using a separate &ldquo;black-box&rdquo; PostScript rasterizer licensed from Adobe.</p>
<p>For the Web, what&rsquo;s cool about services like Webkit is that they can serve different fonts to different browsers running on different platforms depending on the rendering style of the browser, type of display etc., Something that&rsquo;s incredibly hard to do on a case-by-case basis for the average web site owner, unless they are working side by side with a font vendor who can provide a set of custom fonts - people like Font Bureau or Ascender.</p>

<p>Me&gt; Sorry David, I’m awake but I don’t have a clue as to what you’re asking.</p>
<p>I asked around, and we think you&rsquo;re asking if its possible to include more than 256 glyphs in an EOT. The answer is yes, although you probably want to subset a font, that&rsquo;s not required. As a test I took a font with over 600 glyphs and made an EOT, seems to work fine&hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the basic idea behind sevices like Typekit, Christopher. A middle-way where web designers can use fonts through a subscription. Designers can copy ad paste simple code to their pages and choose wich fonts to use in the service&rsquo;s interface, without having to deal with more complex issues like the highly technical ones exposed here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving a try, supplying some few selected display fonts to see how the response of web designers will be for this kind of type design approach.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The definitions relate to Typekit because Adobe, Microsoft, and Apple have made it excessively irritating to create type that looks good onscreen and across software and OS platforms. So instead of just being able to license the existing Postscript fonts, everybody has to make and test TrueType hinted fonts to use with services like Kernest, (and if it leaves beta before the PR person spends all the money, Typekit). This is a problem for type vendors who have a lot of high-end text faces, because hinting the fonts for use at text size is going to take a long time and cost a lot of money, especially if it turns out that web designers would really just rather stick with Georgia and Verdana because most people won’t spot much difference at ten pixels anyway.</div>

<p>This is incorrect. The (ir)relevance of ClearType to PostScript fonts on the web is that in all current browsers ClearType doesn&rsquo;t render PostScript <em>at all.</em> In GDI, which is the legacy graphics interface still used by almost all Windows apps, PostScript fonts are rendered using a &lsquo;black box&rsquo; system from Adobe. The term &lsquo;black box&rsquo; is used to refer to a piece of software that one company licenses to another for use but without any right to modify or look at the code. Adobe licenses a PS rasteriser to Microsoft.</p>
<p>In the new Windows Presentation Format, ClearType rendering, which in GDI only works for TTF, now renders CFF PS fonts also (not PS Type 1 fonts, though). But very few apps and no browsers use WPF. Which is a pity for a number of reasons, not least WPF&rsquo;s excellent built-in OpenType Layout suppport, and superior ClearType rendering (blending x-direction CT colour antialiasing with y-direction greyscale antialiasing for crisply smooth display type).</p>
<p><em>Because Microsoft doesn’t want anyone to steal their secret, they don’t tell us how it really works so almost nobody knows how to make type look good with ClearType.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why they published a book about it.</p>
<p><em>•Blackbox = I think John was referring to the Adobe type rendering engine. It sucks, but it sucks consistently across platforms.</em></p>
<p>I was referring specifically to the Adobe PS rasteriser licensed for use in Windows GDI. Adobe have multiple type rendering engines, which they use in their apps, some rather better than others and most newer than the GDI one.</p>
<hr>
<p>Christopher: <em>I just don’t understand how they relate to what Typekit does.</em></p>
<p>It relates in a number of ways. Firstly, there is the general issue of what all these different rendering engines, font outline and hint formats, and web font delivery formats actually do with the font when it appears in the browser. This issue is not restricted to Typekit: it affects all use of fonts on the web.</p>
<p>James asserts that &lsquo;Postscript fonts [are what] people actually want to use&rsquo;. This is probably true for a lot of display type, but if people are looking for alternative text types for webpages, I think they&rsquo;re going to find that most PS fonts look like crap on most users' systems. I don&rsquo;t think TrueType is going to cease being the better screen font format any time soon. Adobe have been steadily improving their PS rasterisers over the past decade, but I suspect there are diminishing returns and a fixed limit of how good they can get within the PS hint model.</p>
<p>Karsten&rsquo;s actually done the homework:
<a href="http://kltf.de/kltf_notes_raster.htm">http://kltf.de/kltf_notes_raster.htm</a></p>
<p>Secondly, this relates to Typekit because the service they offer includes converting and serving different web format fonts to different browsers, depending on the capabilities of those browsers and the limitations of the web font delivery formats accepted by them. Typekit serves EOT format fonts to Internet Explorer, which because of a bug in Windows (not in the EOT format itself, note) can only handle EOT fonts containing TrueType format outlines and hints. So if you are a font maker and license your fonts for use in the Typekit service, then you need to be aware that the outline format will be converted to TTF before being served as EOT. Personally, if I were licensing through Typekit, I would much rather have control of that conversion process on my end, and deliver TTFs to Typekit to serve as EOTs. [Somewhere on Typophile recently I posted some simple steps to maximise the quality of FontLab TT autohinting, such that it produces pretty good results with ClearType rendering. Controlling y-direction alignment and features has the biggest overall impact in subpixel rendering environments, and this can be controlled relatively easily within FontLab with careful use of alignment zones and standard stem values.]</p>

<p>Is this optimal? No. But then it also wasn&rsquo;t designed as a screen font, and the autohinting was done quickly.</p>
<p>This also demonstrates that the biggest problem with fonts designed as ‘high-end text faces’ for print when used on screen isn&rsquo;t hinting: it&rsquo;s spacing. In full-pixel rendering environments, TT includes hint instruction of advance widths, making it possible to control spacing on screen independently of spacing for higher resolutions. In ClearType, you lose this ability; with PostScript, you never had it in the first place.</p>

<p>Actually, TrueType was created by Apple (only), as a replacement for Type 1, which was costing Apple a lot in licensing fees. Apple was to combine TrueType with Microsoft&rsquo;s TrueImage (a PostScript replacement) so that both Apple and Microsoft could stop paying Adobe so much money.

<p>Apple did it alone, and I remember no patents ever issued to Adobe on this matter. TT was all done on a dare; as in, Adobe said to everybody, &ldquo;We dare you to make better fonts&rdquo; and the rest is Hysteria.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s your point of view, David. But I don&rsquo;t think that accusing other foundries is a good way to convince consumers. I think they will choose what&rsquo;s best for them in each case.</p>
<p>If all the foundries involved &ldquo;want the foundry/customer link to be at least distant from each other&rdquo;, there would be no foundries involved discussing here or anywhere. Makes sense for you?</p>
<p>What is the problem about trying a different model, like the ones offered by Kernest, Typekit, Fontdeck, &amp;c? What&rsquo;s the big deal? I don&rsquo;t accept &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not FontBureau&rdquo; as a valid argument, even though the geat respect I have for your work.</p>

<p>In CT, the solution should be to set a flag that enables x-direction deltas, i.e. to re-enable hinting of widths. It should be possible to hint either to full or to sub-pixel widths.</p>
<p>But that leaves Apple&rsquo;s Quartz rendering which dumps all hints, and Adobe&rsquo;s subpixel rendering, which makes use of at least some hints but isn&rsquo;t documented.</p>
<p>The only cross-platform solution for well-spaced screen fonts is the one you hit on David: ppem size-specific fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>More cans of worms&hellip;yeesh.</p>
<p>Now that @font-face has brought a new awareness and a new level of scrutiny to fonts, people are next going to be wondering why, if a font has been well-crafted, it still doesn&rsquo;t look good.</p>
<p>My biggest beef is that in Windows, at larger sizes, antialiasing stinks. The jaggies are awful. This is true whether it&rsquo;s Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or IE using Windows native rendering engine.
I&rsquo;ve already mentioned - in keeping with John Hudson&rsquo;s screen grab - that rendering of OTF CFF fonts stinks at <em>any</em> font size.
But I have to ask: If CFF is a simpler format than TrueType, and one that deliberately conveys less hinting information to the rasterizer (do I have this right?), then what exactly is it that Windows is being asked to do? Make it look less bad (which seems the case in Hudson&rsquo;s WPF example) or on a par with a well-hinted TrueType font? And if the answer is, &ldquo;On a par with TrueType&rdquo;, well, isn&rsquo;t this too much to expect if the information necessary doesn&rsquo;t exist in the font?
And if the aim is only &ldquo;less bad&rdquo;, that doesn&rsquo;t exactly speak well of CFF as a format suitable for screen-readability, does it?</p>
<p>RE: John Hudson&rsquo;s comparison screen shot&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Windows WPF CFF rasterisation using ClearType.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that IE8 in Standards Mode, renders using a port of WPF. In other words, IE8 is innately capable of this sort of rendering of CFF fonts. If my understanding is correct, a good question is, &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t it do so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very little lag - a second at most on my set up. But any &gt;lag makes me think people might start putting Web fonts on &gt;the metrics of the core fonts to reduce the reflow-flicker &gt;when the fonts load in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Designers are going to be bugged by this, no doubt. There may be ways, via JavaScript, to suppress the rendering of the page until all the fonts show up. We&rsquo;ll see if that gets any traction. Matching up the metrics between two fonts can be tricky and it&rsquo;s an additional bother and barrier to adoption. We&rsquo;ll see how this one plays out.
BTW - Safari (on Windows, at least) waits for the fonts to show up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kind of depends if you gave them conversion rights as part &gt;of the license you signed with them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering how this gibes with consumer protection laws. If I bought it and own it and it&rsquo;s broken, do I not have the right to fix it? I&rsquo;m not so sure the licensing contract would trump local statutes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at TTF rendering in IE8, and it is using the Vista system rasteriser, not the WPF rasteriser. [The easiest way to distinguish them is to look at larger glyphs and see whether there are y-direction jaggies. WPF uses y-direction greyscale antialiasing, so looks smoother.]</p>

<p>I wish that Windows would provide something comparable to Apple&rsquo;s rasterization and make it the default at least for unhinted fonts. If fonts are hinted, ClearType or greyscaling may take over for improved results.
The assumption &ldquo;no rasterization without hinting&rdquo; however is out of date since at least a decade.* That a font is not hinted is not an excuse any more for rasterizing it poorly.</p>

<cite>Working at Adobe in 1995, I learned that hints were the major invention with respect to digital typefaces and that they belong to them due to the typefaces' digital nature. Therefore, in general, (gray)scaling without using hints would be a sacrilege despite the comparisons and tests made by their font people which showed that the best results were obtained without hints.</cite></li>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t suggesting partial hinting, only noting that y-direction controls have the largest overall impact on quality. You can also autohint vertical stems with fairly good results if you take care to create appropriate standard stem values. Basically, what one is doing in this approach is applying something similar to the PS hinting model within TT: providing fairly basic alignment and stem weight information, and letting the rasteriser make the best it can from this. The quality of the result will depend on the rasteriser more than on the font; again, this is like PS hinting. Black and white rendering is what really needs manual hinting; as soon as antialiasing is invoked, you can start to get reasonable results from carefully set-up autohinting. Optimal results? No. But reasonable and economical.</p>
<p><em>It is only when using IE8 as a “host” for viewing XAML that WPF is at work. Not for rendering HTML.</em></p>

<p>Both should be equal, but for some strange reason, Windows are using greyscale mode in FF, even though its configured to use only ClearType.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Re. Mentone:</p>
<p>What you are seeing in IE8 is an EOT font containing CFF-to-TTF converted font data, as discussed earlier in this thread. This is rendered using the system ClearType rasteriser.</p>
<p>What you are seeing in Windows Firefox 3.5 is a CFF font, rendered using the Adobe black box rasteriser within Windows.</p>
<p>The ClearType rasteriser under GDI only works with TTF data. So even if you have the system configured to use ClearType, you will still get greyscale for PostScript fonts.</p>
<hr>
<p>The reason why your fonts display with ClearType in Firefox 3.5, Ricardo, is because they are TTF fonts, not CFF.</p>
<p>Very nice, too.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bryan from Typekit here. There are a few points here for which I thought I&rsquo;d provide some info.</p>
<p><em>  &gt;I was speculating that they might convert to TrueType to give broader support across different platforms - eg. Linux, or versions of Windows that don’t support CFF.&quot; (Sii)</em></p>
<p>That is exactly right. We convert the original format (with permission, of course) to make the font work in as many environments as possible. While doing that, we are dedicated to preserving the quality of the font to the largest degree possible. We very much appreciate the help provided by not only partners like Jan (paragraph), but from forums like this.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are talking to Sii and his team at MSFT, as well as helpful folks like Bill Davis at Ascender, to work through these issues. Every day we are developing techniques to improve the interoperability and the quality of type we&rsquo;re delivering.</p>
<p><em> &gt;There is a lag of three or four seconds before the ‘real’ fonts kick in. (bert_vanderveen)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very little lag - a second at most on my set up.(Sii) </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that we have multiple server locations on each continent, ensuring that any user has the fastest possible connection to the fonts. This gives our service a consistent starting point - it then comes down to an individual user&rsquo;s geography, internet connection, browser and operation system to determine their final experience.</p>
<p>We fully expect the browsers will continue to refine their algorithms for the display of downloaded resources (like images.) Additionally, we&rsquo;re working on some tricks to make the delay/flicker less apparent. </p>
<p>Also, we work hard to use caching to our advantage. The flicker upon load should be significantly reduced when navigating around a site with the same fonts.</p>
<p><em>  &gt;Note that it doesn’t seem to find your real italics (dtw)</em></p>
<p>Typekit style-links the fonts so that they act/work naturally &ndash; meaning if you specify bold, it renders using the actual bold font file. Currently, IE does not support style-linking with @font-face. As such, we use a single file for that browser, and IE synthesizes bold and italic. We are looking at work-arounds that will allow users to gain increased control by accessing the font weights/styles individually.</p>
<p><em> &gt;By the way, as it says in the thread title, it’s “Typekit,” not “TypeKit.” (Christopher Slye )</em></p>
<p>For the record, we are not a fan of camel case. But that&rsquo;s just us.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all your feedback. If there is anyone here that has not seen their invite yet, please drop me a note.</p>

<p>No, about two feet away. If you want a higher resolution screen, sit further away.</p>
<hr>
<p>200 dpi screens have been available for about a decade. But how many of them have you seen in use? We will see increases in resolutions on small device screens (cf. the Palm Pre phone at 180dpi), but probably not on desktop or even laptop monitors. The bigger a screen is, the greater the likelihood of a dead pixel during manufacture; there is some percentage of attrition in all screen manufacture, but the percentage goes up as the screen size goes up, since there are more pixels to potentially fail. Obviously the same is true when you increase resolution, so the rate and cost of attrition for large high resolution screens is much higher than for either smaller screens of the same resolution or lower resolution screens of the same size.</p>

<p>In terms of delivery mechanism it seems as if there&rsquo;s some convergence around the Let-Tal-Error proposal as a long term solution and a compatibility format based on EOT.</p>
<p>Rendering consistency, the strength of Flash, seems to be the Achilles-heel, perhaps the long term solution here might be a property in the font that makes recommendations about how the font should be rendered, or perhaps CSS properties that define rendering style?</p>

<p>TT was invented for a number of reasons, but I presume you are referring to why the TT hinting model was designed to be different from the PS model. Very good reasons c.1990. Very good reasons in black and white pixel display. But when we&rsquo;re spending weeks producing VTT hint sources for fonts targeted at ClearType, whose results in ClearType are &gt;95% identical to FontLab autohinting, and in WPF are almost identical to no hinting at all, how relevant are those reasons?</p>

&ldquo;<em>Rendering consistency, the strength of Flash, seems to be the Achilles-heel, perhaps the long term solution here might be a property in the font that makes recommendations about how the font should be rendered, or perhaps CSS properties that define rendering style?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s got to be a switch to flip somewhere along the line.
Some people participating in this thread might be familiar with an alternative font-linking technique called Cufón. In Windows, Cufón renders headline-sized text beautifully. With Flash-like antialiasing and features. You can get gradients, shadows - very nice stuff. It relies on JavaScript alone.
In IE, Cufón uses VML (Vector Markup Language) and in Firefox and Safari is uses the Canvas tag.
It has drawbacks, problems with text-selection and such, but based solely on the way the text looks, it begs the question, &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I just specify that a block of text be rendered this way and have the browser take it from there?&rdquo; After all, if you can get smooth, good looking curves with VML, it&rsquo;s obvious the browser is capable of it. It can be done, period.
A CSS property perhaps, like visibility:vector or somesuch.</p>

<p>There is a big difference between my &ldquo;not knowing what you&rsquo;re talking about&rdquo; due to your inimitable writing style, and my thinking that you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.
In case anyone gets the wrong idea from your reply to me, 
it&rsquo;s the former, not the latter, and I assume that anyone who writes as uniquely as you do is quite aware of what he&rsquo;s doing and is fully prepared for some good-natured ribbing, which is all I intend. Plus, telling anybody &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about&rdquo; is rude and counter-productive. If I have offended you, I apologize.</p>

<p>SII&gt;the long term solution here might be a property in the font that makes recommendations about how the font should be rendered</p>
<p>Not enough, too late I&rsquo;m afraid. Server-based UFO to TT-only OFF Lite Plus will work for this and all else though. Any puny human formats that need to be dumbed down from there will be easy enough.</p>
<p>John&gt;But when we’re spending weeks producing VTT hint sources for fonts targeted at ClearType, whose results in ClearType are &gt;95% identical to FontLab autohinting, and in WPF are almost identical to no hinting at all, how relevant are those reasons?</p>
<p>Getting 95% of FL hints for 40% of the needed TT instructions, for ıoo% of the users doesn&rsquo;t help, if you know what I mean. 
There is a &lsquo;growing community&rsquo; of full instruction needers.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t realize hinting was an issue, EOT&rsquo;s users rely entirely on ignoring most TrueType Instructions, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>And Richard,  I do not consider it counter productive to tell people who don&rsquo;t know what they are talking about the truth. It&rsquo;s takes too much time otherwise. I didn&rsquo;t mean to insult you, but I&rsquo;m not always talking to everyone. On the other hand, when &lsquo;our problem&rsquo; is a &lsquo;readable web&rsquo;, it seems counter-productive for you to tell people you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try this though; the average text font cannot interoperate where such simple operations as sizing, scaling and rendering is happening in a non-standard way(s)&hellip; particularly when the text font style is being defined before the font&rsquo;s &lsquo;size&rsquo;.  What&rsquo;s Typekit got to do with it?</p>

&ldquo;<em>But I didn’t realize hinting was an issue, EOT’s users rely entirely on ignoring most TrueType Instructions, don’t they?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>No. Untrue. EOT is just a wrapper around a TT file. When the browser receives the font data, it&rsquo;s processed exactly the same as if it had come from a font installed in the operating system. No instructions lost, none added. No visual difference in rendering at all.</p>
<p>@all
In an earlier post on this thread I mentioned Cufón text replacement. I&rsquo;ve been revisiting it, playing around with sub-setting and trying to solve the problem of making the replaced text selectable, cross-browser. (With some good results,too.)
<strong>Factoid:</strong> Cufón works quite well with CFF fonts. Unlike EOT, Cufón ignores, because it doesn&rsquo;t rely on, hinting instructions in TT files.</p>

<p>Irony can be tough to spot sometimes. It&rsquo;s gotten me in a lot of trouble, too. I&rsquo;ve tried to swear off it on the net.
I did have trouble believing you didn&rsquo;t know an EOT was just a regular font file rendered the regular way but how about the newbie who might wander upon this thread and think otherwise?
So for that poor schm-ck, I played it straight.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oh, call me on my hyperbole, why don&rsquo;t you, David. Fair enough.</p>
<p>We, in this case, is Ross, who actually does the hinting and, sensibly and non-hyperbolically, estimates:</p>
<p><em>If it were a sans serif, or perhaps a slab serif, you might approach 85-90%. Otherwise I would put it closer to 60-70%, overall (italics, or something like Gabriola more in the range of &lt;50%). This accounts for simple glyphs which may need no further instructions added in VTT as well as those in which FL is simply unable to isolate features of anatomy that do require more instructions, or indeed fixing instructions that FL adds that make no sense, or that are redundant/conflicting etc.</em></p>
<p>These is based on an FL -&gt; VTT conversion workflow we developed a couple of years ago that allows us to either leverage FL auto stem hinting or manual PS hints in VTT, avoiding much of the drudge work of drawing spaghetti in VTT.</p>
<p>The larger point I was making was that, in subpixel rendering environments, the reliance on hinting is significantly reduced &ndash; and in Apple&rsquo;s Quartz rendering is, literally, removed completely &ndash;, to such a degree that autohinting even on the FL PS-&gt;TT model can be effectively leveraged for a lot of purposes. And let me be completely clear about this: <strong><em>this is not always or even mostly a good thing, and I&rsquo;d like to have more hinting control not less.</em></strong></p>
<p>But given that people are talking about, apparently without humour, about using CFF OpenType fonts on the web, I think it is entirely valid to point out that half-decent autohinting of those same fonts converted to TTF is going to look better than the CFF versions, at least with today&rsquo;s system PS rasterisers. Will these fonts look as good as carefully designed and hinted native TTFs intended for reading on screen? No. But they will still look better on screen than CFF fonts.</p>

What&rsquo;s up with LED backlit screens? Rendering on my iPhone and my HP Touchsmart tablet is very different from what I get on my &ldquo;normal&rdquo; (don&rsquo;t start, David) LCD screens. A crisper, more print-like result. But I haven&rsquo;t been able to find much info about the difference in the technologies.
Any info on that? Does LED in any way cut down on the need to hint?</p>

<p>Yes, sometimes I&rsquo;d like to have total hinting control. Other times I look at the same typeface printed on two different paper stocks, or from two different laser printers claiming the same resolution, and think that the lack of control that we face in different screen rendering technologies isn&rsquo;t anything new.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>JH&gt;Yes, sometimes I’d like to have total hinting control. Other times I look at the same typeface printed&hellip; [] and think that the lack of control that we face in different screen rendering technologies isn’t anything new.</p>
<p>Well, it is something new, if not by percentage of error per feature, then certainly you can imagine a parallel situation in Baskerville&rsquo;s world, where the clients of his type were somehow enabled to reheat type from a letter to whole pages, and let &lsquo;whatever&rsquo; loose on his types, (except perhaps pure ink of any color, and especially not Black)&hellip; while the &ldquo;Baskerville&rdquo; label remained prominently displayable, and unchanged for all to see?</p>
<p>As many unfounders confirmed to my ears in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=atypi+mexico"> Mexico </a>, there is a &lsquo;rendering problem&quot; on the web as a result of there being a difference between hot metal&rsquo;s inadvertent glyph variation spectrum, and the web&rsquo;s, (ahem) glyph variation spectrum at the bottom of the resolution spectrum.</p>

Yes, of course you can get the other bits aswell, and reassemble them. But noone ever claimed different. No DRM, just a technical obstacle.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Last July, we wrote up what we do to protect fonts here:
<a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2009/07/21/serving-and-protecting-fonts-on-the-web/">http://blog.typekit.com/2009/07/21/serving-and-protecting-fonts-on-the-web/</a></p>
<p>We developed this approach in partnership with our foundry partners and have been experimenting with how many glyphs need to be removed from a font in order to make it not actually useful. There is some buggy browser behavior when large portions of the glyphs are removed, so we&rsquo;re trying to find a balance.</p>
<p>Currently we pull out a small number of characters (we try to keep is small to maintain kerning pairs) &ndash; but if we don&rsquo;t think this is enough to make a font unusable, then we&rsquo;ll find a better way.</p>
<p>So - how many charters (and which) should we pull out of the font (and move to a secondary font) to help protect it, in your opinion?</p>

<p>If I were in charge I&rsquo;d apply kerning across all sizes. As I&rsquo;m not in charge this will likely have to wait until CSS lets page designers turn it on or off for a given element.</p>

<p>As I said, I think it is worth talking about. In general, and even in general specifics. Which is why I, personally, don’t have a problem with Florian’s thorough summation of the general procedure.</p>
<p>The detailed, specific click-this–click-that instructions, however, were a little too far over the line for the Typophile folks (which is a distinctly different group from the type-producing community, please realize).</p>
<p>Nor were they/we pressured or even contacted by any font producers. (Although, one person did point out to some of us privately that it would seem a bit hypocritical for Typophile to remove pirate links but let this stand.)</p>
<p>As I said, there was some debate among admins. Jared, Typophile’s founder, made the final call, but was busy and asked me to make the edit and provide the explanation.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Kent, as I&rsquo;ve said before, I&rsquo;m absolutely comfortable with the decision Typophile made, which I think is very grown up. Richard F, let&rsquo;s take what you said here</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more interesting discussion would be to follow the procedure posted by billtroop and see what it gets you and where that leaves you. Put yourself in the shoes of the person doing it. You&rsquo;ve got the font, now what?
That kind of analysis might get you somewhere.&lt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a little further.</p>
<p>Where does it get you? Nowhere, as far as I can see. Why should any of us care about this kind of petty downloading? For all I know, we ought to encourage downloaders, on the grounds that 1 in 100 might become an actual paying customer one day. Fonts are a small business, and we only have to sell a few hundred units to be accounted hugely successful. Sales in the thousands are considered monumental by the standards of this industry. Compare that with the hysteria Hollywood is showing over the entire country of Spain, according to the LA Times a few days ago. Hollywood wants to withdraw sales of DVDs in Spain because there is too much downloading. What will this accomplish? There will be just as much downloading as before, but instead of few retail sales, there will be none. Exactly how does that help?</p>
<p>I think, I hope, I pray, that most graphic designers (professional font users) recognize that intellectual property costs money, and that they should pay for the fonts they have, especially if they actually use them professionally.</p>
<p>Against this we have a whole culture &ndash; whether you define it as all under-30s, or the entire country of Spain, or South Korea - - whatever - - that doesn&rsquo;t see any intellectual property as having financial value. Where does that put us as content creators? Well, we are content creators of <em>reproducible materials</em>. What we know today is that reproducible content is considered valueless. I can&rsquo;t remember if Walter Benjamin predicted this or not in his famous essay, from decades ago, on this very subject. Probably not, because customer copying was still a few decades away.</p>
<p>Contrast with the shocking countertrend, where non-reproducible art &ndash; original paintings and sculpture &ndash; is attracting staggering sums that would have been inconceivable even a decade ago. Did you see what was paid for a not particularly good Giacometti the other day? Over $100 million.</p>
<p>If an OK Giacometti is worth 100 million (Otto Preminger used them as classy garden gnomes in his New York townhouse), what is a Rembrandt worth?</p>
<p>Maybe what we should really ask ourselves is, &lsquo;Why are we in the business of producing easily reproducible objects? Is this what we do with our lives? Is this a legacy we want to leave? Are we willing to pay the price?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think, as an artist/craftsman, you can afford to be that possessive about reproducible art/craft. If that&rsquo;s the way you feel, it&rsquo;s time to get into non-reproducibles.</p>

<p>Richard, this makes me wonder what happens when someone publishes proof that a security hole exists in some important piece of software. The solution is always proprietary, obviously, but what do you gain by hiding the method of attack? One could argue that the method of attack should be as widely disseminated as possible so that there is maximum awareness of the need to plug the hole.</p>
<p>But why isn&rsquo;t anybody talking about making fonts more intelligent? Why can&rsquo;t a font know where it is, what it&rsquo;s being used for, who is using it, who owns it, etc. etc. If, that is, anybody cares at that level? Not that I&rsquo;m advocating that level of security control. If you spend some time in a library looking at old computer magazines, you&rsquo;ll see that the consistent experience of the personal computer industry, from the early 1980s to the present, is that copy protection alienates, rather than attracts, customers.</p>

<p>If you mean, why isn&rsquo;t the W3C talking about fonts being more intelligent. The answer to that is they don&rsquo;t define font formats.</p>
<p>If you mean, why are not the guardians of OpenType&rsquo;s Specification talking about fonts being more intelligent, the answer is that they don&rsquo;t define font formats, (it as an ISO issue).</p>
<p>If you mean, why isn&rsquo;t ISO talking about fonts being more intelligent, they asked for that, they&rsquo;ll probably realize by 2015 it is not what they got, (unless putting 63,342 delta or shift instructions into a font for Windows is considered intelligent).</p>
<p>If you mean, why are not many makers of type talking about fonts being more intelligent, it already is (&ldquo;you want it to do &lsquo;what&rsquo; now?&quot;)</p>
<p>If you mean, why are not the makers of intelligent type talking about fonts being more intelligent, &ldquo;why bother talking?&rdquo;</p>

<em>If I were in charge I&rsquo;d apply kerning across all sizes. As I&rsquo;m not in
charge this will likely have to wait until CSS lets page designers
turn it on or off for a given element.</em></p>
<p>To some degree you are in charge, your comments to the www-style mailing list would certainly be influential.</p>
<p>The current editor&rsquo;s draft of the CSS3 Fonts spec makes font kerning
on by default, with an option to turn it off explicitly:</p>
<p><a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/#font-kerning-prop">http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/#font-kerning-prop</a></p>
<p>I would agree with Si, I think it&rsquo;s simpler for kerning to be on by
default but I&rsquo;d be interested in hearing if some folks (dberlow?)
believe the default behavior should be linked to font size.</p>
<p>In the past, the arguments around kerning speed were more structural, to get
kerning a slower-path general text rendering API was required.  On
Windows, general GDI rendering is much faster than using Uniscribe and
on the Mac, CoreGraphics text API&rsquo;s are much faster than ATSUI. With
more modern API&rsquo;s like DirectWrite (Windows) and CoreText (Mac) this
is no longer completely valid, although I&rsquo;m sure there will always be
a way to render text &ldquo;fast but incorrectly&rdquo; on any platform. ;)</p>

<p>You would have compulsory kerning for 6 pt text on a 100 dpi display? 150 dpi at best? 200 dpi at very very best?</p>
<p>Have you done any of the math? Have you considered what meaning any of your kerning units would have under these conditions? Discussing how the text engine works needs to connect to the end result: the permissible parameters for the arrangement of pixels on the display.</p>

<p>I think kerning is like many typographic issues making the transition to the web, having positive effect for some web users and either neutral or negative effect for others.</p>
<p>The Electronic Permissions and Recommendations table contains my recommendations for dealing with the issue of kerning from the foundry point of view, speaking to the web developer, during and after this transition.</p>
<p>What is recommended there is the ability of the font to contain information that can tell <em>something/one</em> the difference between kerning pairs that will likely cause negative effects from kerning pairs that are likely to help. This is a start, but the iPad may already need it. ;)</p>
<p>Having only the choice of specifying &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;off&rdquo; by default, I would most certainly recommend it being off.</p>

<p>Yes, it should never kern. (On the grounds that a zoomed object should always reveal as accurately as possible the underlying object. Zooming should not change its characteristics, only its visibility or legibility or comprehensibility.)</p>
<p>That the question arises signifies the need to recalibrate the system&rsquo;s philosophy. Or maybe it suggests the need to place a philosophy into a system that may not have one?</p>
<p>Trying to accomplish typesetting on a system with unknown (and unknowable) output parameters makes exactly what kind of sense?</p>
<p>At that point, surely, it&rsquo;s better to concentrate on solving basic communication problems?</p>
<p>In this case, what we know of the unknowable is that the greatest number of target display systems is capable of well under 150 dpi, and that this is not adequate to sustain kerning as it is understood by most type designers. It therefore seems to me that there is more reward from designing fonts that do not require kerning than from designing fonts that may kern desirably only 5% of the times they are displayed &ndash; at best, and may kern undesirably in over 70% of cases. The designer should be focusing on realistically designing for realistic systems.</p>
<p>Who needs the processor overhead and the architectural headaches of something the vast majority of users need never be aware of?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with some simple goal, like &lsquo;using technology realistically to accomplish the greatest good for the greatest number of people&rsquo; ? ?</p>

<p>Sorry, I proposed a slightly more complex version but then ousted it myself. The only thing I did add as a result of this, was recommended word-length. The font, it&rsquo;s kerning pairs and the html that employs the font, contain all the data required to make decisions as you suggest in your question to Bill.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>some threshold kerning data is no longer optimal/appropriate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My understanding from Robert O&rsquo;Callahan at Mozilla is that Firefox only kerns above 20px. I had wanted to ask what the reason was for that, but got sidetracked.
What about the ability for the author to set a threshold? I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s doable or desirable - just tossing it out.</p>
<p>I agree that kerning should be enabled by default.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>why not just include/omit kerning data?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, it&rsquo;s always controllable at the level of the font.
What I&rsquo;d like to know - and don&rsquo;t - (David? Anybody?) - is whether <em>the same kerning that works for print works for screen.</em>
A perspective: Today, we ask fonts to do double-duty onscreen and in print. In an era of instantly downloadable fonts, I do not believe that will continue to be the case.
For many kinds of information - print stylesheets - with the document formatted not only for screen but specifically for print, font and all, will become much more commonplace.
(And, BTW, appropriate print font(s) for use within print stylesheets or HTML-to-PDF conversion, I would gladly pay a premium for. I know that, for some, the idea of browsers being the main desktop publishing apps of the future sounds radical, even disturbing - and I understand completely. I shudder somewhat, too. But we&rsquo;re only a few steps away from it. And efficiency will demand it. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time.)</p>
<p>Therefore, I second John Daggett&rsquo;s suggestion that all informed and influential voices be heard. All opinions are welcome and needed in getting this right. Abrasion is a good and necessary thing. From the oyster comes the pearl.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think the desirable behavior for screen is not turning off kerning at small sizes, but adjusting tracking at those sizes. The same <em>spacing</em> that works for print isn&rsquo;t so great for screen, and vice versa&hellip; unless the typeface was designed for small sizes in print. Basically at the &ldquo;same&rdquo; size on screen, ideal tracking is looser.</p>
<p>Verdana is a great example. Works great in print with the default spacing&hellip; at something like six to eight point. Ikea uses Verdana at larger sizes, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure they have adjusted the tracking at display sizes in particular.</p>
<p>However, as the desirability of looser tracking is font-specific, and some typefaces already have it right for screen, I expect this does not belong in the realm of browser default behaviors, but instead in the realm of intelligent web design decisions, when coupled with being reasonably sure what font will be displayed by most browsers (that is, assuming @font-face support, or using &ldquo;web-safe&rdquo; fonts).</p>

<p>The question is the same for kerning and contours. The answer is too: I can&rsquo;t tell you an answer.</p>

<p>I beg to slightly differ. If you first beat the fonts with low resolution fraction bars until the letters are barely recognizable without the file name, you can take away the kerning without appearing to damage the already severely damaged typeface.</p>

I think the definition of getting it right should include:
leaving it up to the web designer to turn on, 
leaving it up the the web user to turn off,
leaving it up to the founder to optimize for print, screen or both
leaving the browsers out of it (via instantaneous universal compliance),

<p>I agree as regards the effect. I&rsquo;d only change the order. First, there is technology-independent design, including ideal placement of letters (expressed as advance width and kerning), ideal placement of marks, etc. Then, there is technology-specific adjustments overriding the former ideal design.
This is only my opinion, obviously, but I feel cheated if I design a typeface, turn it into a font, and then see apps ignoring whatever data they consider unnecessary, like kerning or other OT layout behavior.</p>

<p>Rich, instead of asking yourself if the same kerning <em>does</em> work for print and screen, why don&rsquo;t you ask yourself if the same kerning <em>could</em> work for print and screen. (Short answer: it doesn&rsquo;t; it can&rsquo;t.) Consider some common characters and widths in a print font. Look at some moderate kerning pairs. Now consider how that font is rasterized on a 100 dpi screen. By using a gigantic amount of technology, painfully built up over the last thirty years, we can just about barely get it to rasterize recognizably on screen. Now you want us to move its position on screen by a minute amount. But the pixel width of the character is only, say, 12. So how are you going to get the character to move by 6%, say?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at Windows Times New Roman, and the kerning pair LT. The specified kern is -188. The width of T is 1251, so you want this character to be moved left by 188 units (about 15% of its width) in a font which was designed to a grid of 2048. But as it is being rasterized onscreen, its effective grid is, say, 17, if we&rsquo;re very lucky.</p>
<p>Evidently, you are assuming that the screen has infinite resolution. But it doesn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>Now do you see why your question doesn&rsquo;t make sense?</p>
<p>Someone at Mozilla told you something kerns. Did they tell you if it kerns accurately? What is the quality of the kern they are talking about? Did they tell you how accurately the browser will be able to micro-move the kerned glyph?</p>
<p>Thomas, if the system resolution is so coarse that accurate kerning isn&rsquo;t possible, then how is acceptable tracking possible? You give the example of Verdana having the right fitting for screen use, but needing to be tightened up for advertising text. This will work, because the advertising/print designer has almost infinite control. But if you take it the opposite way, trying to get a tightly spaced display font to display well on the web at 8 points, it doesn&rsquo;t work so nicely. There is almost zero control.</p>
<p>There can be no equivalence between web and print fonts until screen resolution approaches print. They are different systems with different demands. Unless of course you&rsquo;d like to see CT style rendering of type in the next print book you read? Hey, with color laser why not?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Finally, why make the assumption that a designer has kerned a font desirably? At Random House, in the 1990s, experienced, absolutely top-notch book designers would often routinely turn off kerning when using fonts like Minion because the kerning caused more problems than it cured. You simply cannot assume that kerning is correct or desirable for a given display/printing system/job merely because it is present. Furthermore, if, as Thomas suggests, tracking should be different for different sizes/resolutions, which is just a shorthand way of saying that each font should be individually designed for precisely the display parameters under which it will be used (which is really the one unavoidable truth-bogeyman sardonically listening in on all these discussions), then the same is true for kerning: as tracking changes (or as the underlying system changes, necessitating tracking changes), then so, too, do the kerning requirements of that particular situation.</div>

<p>A (well made) font contains the data needed to produce the anticipated text. Text is more than rowing shapes next to each other. And data required for producing text is more than a collection of shapes.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A real life example is worth more than a ream of posturing. Thank you, Mike.</p>
<p>Two immediate problems are visible at once.</p>
<p>Not one, not two, but <em>many</em> of the characters are inferior in the kerned version. Leaping to sight, in just the word Tonights, n, i, g, h, t, are markedly inferior in the kerned version. After that, the majority of cap stems lose most of their blackness in the kerned version. This is not a good result. The price of subpixel kerning can never by its very nature be less than substantial degradation.</p>
<p>What do we gain? We gain some very coarse kerning. Because of the minuteness of the pixel grid, even with the theoretical 3x advantage you gain from subpixel manipulation, it seems apparent that you are kerning (are you?) to units whose minima are too large. AVA is more natural unkerned, and while a slight correction of TA would be desirable, the correction here is too much. Similarly, for WAV, AV again works surprisingly well unkerned, and though a tiny amount of negative kerning would be desirable for WA, the correction here is too strong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d call this a good demonstration of what can be done, now, today. However, it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;d want to see implemented &ndash; yet &ndash; because the tradeoffs seem too great. Keeping in mind, too, that the illustration is a best case scenario because the type color is black and quality loss is much greater when it is another color. (Add a transparency effect and you&rsquo;d be taxing the system way beyond its limits.) Does anyone have any idea when true 300 dpi screens might be possible? 300 dpi plus subpixel control would be the point where you might think seriously about general implementation. Is it three years away? In which case we need to think about it. Or is it ten years away? In which case not many of us need to think about it.</p>

<em>I think the desirable behavior for screen is not turning off kerning at small sizes, but adjusting tracking at those sizes.</em></p>
<p>A lot of interesting questions flying around.
CSS has a property that&rsquo;s supposed to offer control of tracking: letter-spacing.
At the pixel level, it most definitely does. Never tried it in a print stylesheet.
What does it do at the sub-pixel level? Don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>I can tell you this: I&rsquo;ve done a lot of experimenting with the word-spacing property, using em units. You can get a very consistent cross-browser result - on Windows, at least. However, the way each browser calculates and interprets ppm is not totally uniform - differences in rounding, etc&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As you would expect, the CoolType rendering is markedly fuzzier (less black; more unhelpful artefacts; suboptimal generalized guessing). As you would expect, there is further deterioration in the kerned line both at normal and high magnification. Why is the kerned text less readable at normal magnification? Because under conditions of low resolution and small size, the more spacing the better. If the kerning philosophy here were to obtain even spacing by expanding pairs where possible rather than contracting them, legibility and reader comfort would increase substantially. Which is just another way of making Thomas&rsquo;s point, that, if you have to pick, tracking is going to give you better results than kerning. When he first raised the point, my first response was that if a system can&rsquo;t do kerning well, it can&rsquo;t do tracking well. And that holds. But I lost sight of Thomas&rsquo;s larger point, which is that if you have to choose which to use in a suboptimal resolution system, tracking is a superior and vastly more flexible option, because tracking is a continuously adjustable parameter that can be visually inspected and changed at will, while kerning is fixed and closed.</p>
<p>Cambria is an interesting example to use, precisely because it is so unrobust under these taxing conditions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If we&rsquo;re talking about whether kerning should be specified as on or off by default <em>in the context of the CSS standard,</em> then I have to say that it should be <em>on</em> because otherwise we end up on the MS Word scenario moving forward: it doesn&rsquo;t matter how good displays get or how carefully fonts are made and kerned for screen, most web documents will end up with unkerned text for most readers for decades to come. I see no good reason to hamper the future of web typography with a standard tailored to today&rsquo;s limitations and problems, especially not when those can be directly addressed by the web designer and, indeed, the font maker, by turning off kerning in specific documents or making web fonts with limited and carefully considered kerning. I would much rather be in a situation in which kerning is active by default and may be turned off at the document, paragraph or even word level, than a situation in which kerning is off and needs to be selectively turned on for all those levels. I can also imagine that a web developer will be more likely &ndash; and more happy &ndash; to turn kerning off if he sees that something looks bad than to turn it on to check to see whether it looks good.</p>
<p>The screen resolutions of mobile devices are now breaching the 200dpi mark. Does this mean that all fonts will suddenly become perfect or adequate screen fonts for text sizes? No, it doesn&rsquo;t. But disabling kerning doesn&rsquo;t make them so either. The best webfonts will remain fonts designed specifically for screen &ndash; and note that I don&rsquo;t include the MS ClearType fonts in this category, since they were intended from the beginning as hybrid screen/print fonts &ndash;, and I agree with Karsten that it makes no sense to disable part of the spacing model that may apply to such fonts.</p>
<p>As I understand it, David&rsquo;s epar solution effectively treats kerning somewhat like antialiasing in the gasp table, something that can be turned on or off or perhaps even modified at specific ppem sizes or ranges. This is sensible, although as Thomas points out, controlling tracking relative to ppem may make even more sense.</p>
<p>The difficult issue of kerning in low resolutions is, of course, rounding. But then this is also the difficult issue of spacing in general for low resolutions, and again Karsten seems right: why disable part of the spacing model when the whole model is subject to the same issues?</p>
<p>Further, let&rsquo;s pull our heads out of the Latin script sandbox and take a look at the numerous writing systems of the world for which some amount of kerning is pretty much essential, and without which collisions or huge gaps are inevitable due to the unmodularity of symbols. In the Latin script, we have it pretty easy because there are only a small number of letters, like T, whose shapes mean that their spatial relationship to adjacent letters may result in either large gaps or collisions. There are other writing systems in which such issues are widespread.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of making an Ethiopic screen font based around a 13ppem grid and presuming sub-pixel display and the potential for sub-pixel kerning. Ethiopic fonts desperately need kerning, because the irregular shapes can result in white space within words that may optically be even larger than the regular word space.</p>
<p>The tall vowels of the Thai script hang over preceding bo-height letters, unless of course those letters are carrying vowel and/or tone marks, in which case contextual kerning is required to avoid collisions (kerning off marks embedded within a stack while ignoring the presence of other marks: the sort of clever thing that GPOS kerning makes possible).</p>
<p>[Some of these script or language specific spacing issues are addressed at the shaping engine level. At least some OTL complex script shaping engines not only have the kern feature on by default but also make it impossible to turn off; others have it on by default but enable the user to turn it off via an application UI.]</p>
<p>Kerning and mark positioning interaction similarly becomes critical in many Arabic fonts and, of course, becomes an issue even for the Latin script when dynamically positioned combining marks are thrown into the mix. So looking at whether or not to kern on screen as if it were 1985 and all fonts had only precomposed glyphs and were mostly Latin script seems to me a very bad idea. Them interwebs is World Wide.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, although I agree on a fuzzy level with many of the points you make, your presentation is marred by two weaknesses.</p>
<ol>
<li>You assume that kerning in a font is an absolute, and that it is absolutely correct.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is nothing of the kind. Kerning is as subject to fashion as anything else. For example, Matthew Carter once told me that the entire Bitstream library had been too aggressively kerned, simply because it was the fashion of the day &ndash; and that he wished he could now change it &ndash; just fifteen years later &ndash; so far had kerning fashion changed in such a short period of time. Kerning also requires to be different at different display sizes. Far more important than getting kerning right is getting spacing right &ndash; that is the weak point of nearly all font designers. Self-taught designers don&rsquo;t get adequate grounding in it, and neither do Reading students. You also have to accept that fact that at low resolution, nearly any mechanism that contracts space will make the type less pleasant to look at and less legible to read. Nor, like kerning, is there ever an absolutely correct spacing. There is spacing that works at some sizes and resolutions, and not at others. There are different spacing schemes for the same font and the same conditions that look different but are both equally valid. There is no one right answer &ndash; although there are many, many wrong answers.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>You assume you know how Ethiopians and Thais read by applying in, I must say, rather an imperial manner, standards you have thought up &ndash; standards that are utterly western-centric and not particularly sophisticated as such. But you are not fully comfortable with English text &ndash; so what makes you a suitable candidate to decide what the rest of the world needs? The weak point in all your multiscript pronouncements is that you don&rsquo;t know actually know anything about these scripts. When you know the languages as well as a native, and have learnt to think like an Ethiopian, a Thai, or any of the other unfortunate peoples of the world whose scripts you have been high-handedly and gleefully toying with for the past ten years, then I will consider that you have something to say. But you don&rsquo;t even make an effort to learn anything of these tongues and the vast paraphernalia of visual tradition, psychology, etc., that form the soul of these scripts. Sir Richard Burton you ain&rsquo;t. You illustrated earlier in this thread that you didn&rsquo;t understand the spacing of the 52 basic English letters when you stated that straight-sided caps don&rsquo;t need to kern &ndash; Matthew Carter always kerns every straight-sided cap to nearly every possible lowercase letter. What audacity, then, to impose upon the credulous at Microsoft and elsewhere the idea that you are suited to make up rules for other languages. I am agog with admiration! Such audacity should be celebrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a font is spaced correctly to begin with, then there is a greater likelihood that Thomas&rsquo;s suggestion &ndash; which is the only practical one &ndash; will work better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s time to reread Walter Tracy on kerning?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David and I have both asked how kerning units are expected to be resolved at screen resolutions? What errors will there be when two glyphs, each ten pixels wide, are kerned at -63 units? What are the average and greatest errors? How do you define what is and is not an acceptable error? How are the roundoffs made? When? How capriciously does the subpixel system re-position stems? (If memory serves, some years ago David pointed out that with ClearType, a row of I&rsquo;s will not all have the same widths &ndash; how has this substantial defect been addressed, if it has been? How might kerning or tracking affect it? Similar questions for CoolType and Quartz. I mean, what&rsquo;s the point in worrying about kerning or tracking when you can&rsquo;t get a row of capital I&rsquo;s to be the same width? &ndash; and Karsten thinks there&rsquo;s some sort of integrity possible with this kludge?)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consider kerning an absolute. I consider it font-specific, and hence subject to fashion, yes, but also to specific technical limitations and environments targeted by that font, subject to degradation in some situations/environments, and like all spacing should be considered size-specific (see No.5 below) &ndash; all of which is expected and why one font does not rule all &ndash; but always font-specific, affecting font-specific glyph relationships that a general principle such as ‘Don&rsquo;t apply kerning to any font at X size’ cannot adequately resolve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bill, you and I managed to get back onto some kind of civil footing over the past couple of years. Please don&rsquo;t let your rhetorical enthusiasms get the better of you, if only to save me from the near occasion of anger, especially not in Easter season.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I actually do know what I am talking about, work closely with native script experts and people who have made serious academic study, take a research-based approach to writing systems, and have won awards for type design in local competitions judged by native users. Contrary to what you write, I actually make a massive effort to understand these writing systems from the inside-out, taking into account culture, tools, idioms, manuscript traditions, etc.</p>
<p>[re. Matthew&rsquo;s kerning of uppercase straight-edge letters to lowercase: Matthew&rsquo;s fonts are spaced with some internal letterspacing for all-caps, requiring tightening of spacing for following lowercase. In other words, these fonts implement two different spacing models at the sidebearing level and then correct for the relationship between the two models at the kerning level. This is both structurally awkward, prone to missed or overlooked relationships (as, e.g. the failure of diacritic letters to inherit the kerning of regular letters in those of Matthew&rsquo;s fonts that I looked at today), and inefficient at the layout processing level. The ‘cpsp’ GPOS feature exists precisely to enable independent spacing of allcaps, making it both feasible and sensible to implement only one global spacing model at the sidebearing level. Note that I am not criticising Matthew&rsquo;s overall spacing, but the way in which it is technically implemented between sidebearings and kerning.]</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Yes. But kerning is, presuming a well-spaced font, precisely a mechanism for dealing with those relationships that are exceptional to sidebearing spacing, and my point is that the quantity and nature of those relationships is different across different writing systems, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe also time to read Tracy on non-Latin scripts too. Now there is an example of someone pronouncing on other writing systems with only the barest, Encyclopaedia Britannica knowledge of them, resulting in a confused and fundamentally incorrect description of the Arabic writing system that continues to plague font technology to this day, infecting both Unicode and OpenType.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A basic principle of raster imaging: the larger the number of ‘dots’ you have to wrap a glyph to, the smaller the rounding errors and hence the smaller the distortion of the UPM grid. This principle is the same for white areas of the glyph as it is for black areas (which is why, in b/w rendering, being able to hint the sidebearings was as important as being able to hint the stems). At any size other than a one-to-one raster grid to UPM relationship, rounding is an issue. Obviously the smaller the raster grid, the coarser the rounding; the larger the raster grid, the finer the rounding. Kerning units are UPM units, so the obvious answer to how they are ‘expected to be resolved at screen resolutions’ is that they should be expected to be resolved like any other aspect of the raster grid, because anything other than that is impossible to predict and design for (which was a key problem with pre-WPF/DWrite ClearType, in which white space was rasterised differently from glyph shape).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, what (striped) subpixel rendering does is to increase the resolution in one direction (x-direction in most cases), increasing the number of ‘dots’ and hence reducing the distortion of the glyph shape, improving fidelity to the type design as expressed in the UPM grid. [And I have been saying for a very long time that the goal of all antialiasing, whether grey, colour, full- or subpixel, is to better represent the individuality of typeface designs &ndash; a component of WYSIWYG &ndash;, and not fundamentally a ‘readability’ technology. The readability aspects of antialiasing are relative to quality of design and hinting and to increases in resolution.] From this, bearing in mind the principle above, two things may be concluded: a) if glyph outlines are rasterised to a subpixel grid, then the whitespace had sure as heck better be too (or are we talking out of our arses when we wax lyrical about ‘designing the white’?); and b) screen optimised fonts are fonts that have been designed and spaced for specific rendering environments and sizes, and anything else is a sub-optimal compromise.</p>
<p>I take the view that all aspects of type are size-specific and that scaleable type is, by its nature, a sub-optimal compromise for all but one or a small range of sizes. This is true of glyph design and of spacing, including kerning. The mechanisms of our scaleable type font formats are mechanisms of degradation: one can, for instance, increase tracking, but that affects sidebearing spacing independent of kerning values. Hinting, traditionally, enabled one to correct for some &ndash; but not all &ndash; kinds of degradation, e.g. by in effect applying size-specific glyph design adjustments and by hinting sidebearings. As antialiasing intrudes, the impact of such methods is reduced proportionally to the fidelity to the UPM expressed design, i.e. the more the rendering engine strives to make the font look like a specific typeface, the less the font maker can strive to optimise it for a specific size. As David has long since concluded, the only possible response to full-on hint-free antialiasing à la Apple is individual designs for individual ppem sizes. Welcome back to the world of &lsquo;optical masters&rsquo; or whatever else you want to call them.</p>
<p>But presuming scaleable fonts and the use of the same design and font-internal spacing data at different sizes, here&rsquo;s an aspect of GPOS kerning with which most people are probably unfamiliar: all GPOS lookups, including ‘cpsp’ and ‘kern’ lookups, may have size-specific adjustments. In other words, it is possible, within the OTL GPOS kerning infrastructure, to adjust kerning for specific ppem sizes. This doesn&rsquo;t, of course, do away with the unpredictability of different rendering engines, with rounding issues, etc., as the adjustments are subject to the same raster issues as the outline and basic spacing. But it does mean that, uniquely I believe, OpenType provides for size-specific kern data. Now, I&rsquo;m not aware of even one OT font that makes use of size-specific GPOS adjustments for kerning &ndash; and only aware of one font that makes use of size-specific mark attachment adjustments &ndash;, because frankly life is short.</p>

<p>How important is Apple&rsquo;s current Quartz policy? How assured is its continuation? How badly does Quartz perform under kerning scenarios? How do we know Apple hasn&rsquo;t got something new up its sleeve? If kerning is going to be implemented, isn&rsquo;t it excessively onerous that there be three entirely different subpixel rendering engines to which text might be subjected? I would have thought, going forward into the darkness of kerning and tracking, that the dominant model will be MS&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Much else to think about here.</p>
<p>Small point: where diacritics fail to inherit parent kerning, the reason may be that many or most of the parent combinations aren&rsquo;t likely to occur.</p>
<p>Also I was unaware about ppem-specific kerning tables. Now that makes sense:  you could easily calculate the units you needed.</p>

<p>Regarding CSS, I&rsquo;m getting the feeling that the term &ldquo;on by default&rdquo; could use some clarifying.</p>
<p>Browsers apply default style sheets that automatically set properties for different HTML elements. This happens &ldquo;sight unseen&rdquo; in the background. In other words, browsers first &ldquo;style&rdquo; the page according to this built-in default style sheet. Additional styling supplied by the author or user are in addition to these default styles. 
This default style sheet acts as a fallback mechanism so that at least some styling is applied in the absence of another style sheet. An example of this rudimentary styling is often what you see in an RSS feed viewed in a browser.
It is very common practice for web authors to use a group of &ldquo;reset&rdquo; style rules to modify the defaults so as to get a clean slate - it makes things easier. (Google &ldquo;reset CSS stylesheets&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m sure a dozen variations will pop up.)
For kerning, what &ldquo;on by default&rdquo; means is that for any element with textual content the default style sheet will set kerning to ON.
Now, when this gets implemented, it&rsquo;s not going to be a secret. Web authors will either let the default stand or add a rule to the reset that turns kerning off.
This will become a matter of habit and best practice.
In those situations - like a bare-bones RSS feed - where there is <em>only</em> the browser&rsquo;s default styling, I can&rsquo;t see any harm in kerning being set as ON. (And even then, user&rsquo;s always have override options.)
Under usual circumstances, web author&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t going to be hamstrung one way or the other simply because kerning is on by default. Whether it&rsquo;s on by default or off by default will, down the road, be very close to six of one, half a dozen of the other.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mr. Hudson&gt;As I understand it, David&rsquo;s epar solution effectively treats kerning somewhat like antialiasing in the gasp table&hellip;</p>
<p>The EPAR as suggested says: &ldquo;Use of the font without kern table? Yes/No&rdquo;, and lets one turn pairs on and off at size/pixel boundaries. The Yes/No, is intended for fonts that &ldquo;require kerning&rdquo; to &ldquo;say so&rdquo;, and the rest is for people who want to describe the delicate balance of performance vs. quality in use. The EPAR as published for comment is incorrect and I have noted it to the developer.</p>
<p>The other whole issue being discussed is a perfect example of making the best wywsiwyg possible — vs. screen typography. If John D. and Simon D. want to turn kerning on by default in pursuit of wywsiwyg (and in the absence of a tag just to indicate fonts that require kerning), we&rsquo;ll just have to react with even more expert work until the 1% of fully wywsiwyg-ed users grows up. I will even do my best to correct the fact that only 1/4 of Verdana is kerned.</p>
<p>We all, (those involved in current web type projects of various kinds), are about to take a quality beating over this, no matter what we do, (with the exception of the alternative, an economic beating) — no one &lsquo;out there&rsquo; gives an a&rsquo;s tail for MS&rsquo;s or Apple&rsquo;s wywsiwyg, (if you need a spectrum-o-proof, just look at the decade of anti-aliased abstinence of XP users, and the popularity of the iPad). The main reason for this beating, as I&rsquo;ve said, is that the &ldquo;standards&rdquo; process is ____ed up, significantly so by now, via seemingly mindless meddling by those uninvolved in web type projects of any meaningful kind.</p>

<p>What I am interested to know &ndash; and perhaps John Daggett can comment on how this might work out in Firefox &ndash; is how this level of kerning toggling in CSS relates to shaping engine behaviour. As a non-browser parallel, consider Microsoft Office, which notoriously has kerning turned off by default, relying on the user to turn it on. But individual script shaping engines (in Uniscribe) automatically apply the ‘kern’ layout feature for some scripts, and toggling the Word kerning control on/off makes no difference at all to whether those scripts are kerned: they are always kerned because the shaping engine is effectively grabbing control of kerning as part of standard script and language shaping.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued to know whether a browser using these shaping engines (whether in Uniscribe or in DWrite), will behave like Word, accepting whatever shaping layout features the engine applies, including kerning; or, indeed, whether the browser using such layout engines has any choice in the matter.</p>

<p>While that&rsquo;s general true for content creation software and static layout documents, I think a case can be made that ‘zoom’ in the context of dynamic layout documents might be differently interpreted or, perhaps, that a distinction needs to be made for such documents between zooming and englarging. Enlargning text and other elements within a dynamic layout document is precisely the sort of thing that I would expect to affect the layout, including the microtypography since, after all, the text is being displayed at a different size.</p>

<p>I was just looking at metal type like this in the 1912 Linotype specimen book. There was no kerning to begin with, and in the process of making smaller sizes, they just spaced it all out. Later, C. Griffith came in, threw it all away and developed all new series.</p>

<p>You wish to make a distinction for . . . whom? The same people who for ten years kept ClearType turned off? Aren&rsquo;t they (and even us) confused enough already? ? ? And John, speaking of distinctions, Bill Keller was very upset when he took over the New York Times and discovered that the newspaper had spelt the name Madeleine Albright in over 20 different ways over the years, but here in one paragraph you spell enlarging incorrectly twice, which is unlike you. Is it a return of your old post-Paschal tension?</p>
<p>David, did Griffith actually revise old series with different spacing? There certainly are optical adjustments in some of the classic American sans serifs - - though I don&rsquo;t know why I am thinking particularly of sanses. What would be interesting is if Lino ever did a sans with f-logotypes. Surely not?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, when I increase the zoom in e.g. FontLab or InDesign, it is because I want to examine more closely some detail of the design/layout; when I increase the zoom in Firefox, it is almost always because the text a page is too small for me to read (usually due to inappropriate use of absolute text sizing in CSS). That being the case, why wouldn&rsquo;t I want that text to be reformatted for the larger display size? Either what makes good typography good is size-specific or it isn&rsquo;t. If it is size-specific, then dynamic text should incorporate dynamic typography (preferably within a dynamic layout).</p>

<p>I think it is, if you&rsquo;re talking W3C WG. But not in the way you might imagine.
I&rsquo;ve done a lot of work on this.
Being able to detect, via script, zoom and text size settings and, as importantly, detecting user changes as capturable events that the scripter can react to programmatically, will do the trick.
Right now it&rsquo;s a slapdash proposition - depends on the browser.
In IE you can detect changes in Zoom:

<p>In some ways this is similar to your Franky page, if I remember it correctly.
I have a proof of concept of this that&rsquo;s fairly well-formed, which includes capturing Text Size also, but I had to put it on ice for awhile.
Y&rsquo;know, the web fonts thing.</p>
