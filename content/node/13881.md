    a newspaper).\r\n<em>PDF sample of Folha:</em> http://www.fontfabrik.com/fofawor1.html"

  body: "Just a wild guess. But have you seen the thinner weight of Floris (an improved
    version of Folha, with more weights, as I assume from the sample in Language Culture
    Type)? It is similar to the type in your sample.\r\n\r\nAnd BTW, where did you
    get the mousepad picture?\r\nThe answer may point to a better direction."

    Lebedev</a> site. Lately there is a lot of attention for this keyboard, and on
    this page you can see the Mus-mouse too.

    nice to see such heavy commissioning action - bravo.\r\nCould we find out how
    much it cost?\r\n\r\nSomething else: the italic sans seems to be uniwidth with
    the roman (which can make sense). But did you notice that the italic serif is
    <strong>wider</strong> than the roman? I wonder why. Also: is the Light light
    enough?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
