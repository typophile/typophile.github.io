body: I have a fairly &#39;loose&#39; based japanese design them going for a certain
  project, actually a cd package. I trying to find type that would prove campatible,
  or harmonious. I&#39;m not necessarily looking for a japanese type of face &#40;yes
  it will be english&#41;, but then I am not apposed to the idea either. <BR> <BR>Ideas?

    target="_blank">http://www.gerardunger.com</a>&#41; used with Japonese type &#40;sans
    and serif experiments&#41; on the typophile pages... Can&#39;t find the topic.
    Anyone remembers this?

  body: If it were me, I&#39;d study Japanese type designers&#39; work... often times
    they romanize Katakana and Hiragana faces they&#39;ve created, giving them a unique
    feel. <a href="http://04.jp.org">Check out this site</a>. It&#39;s got some downloadable
    faces and some great links to other Japanese sites.

  body: 'Keith had pointed out that Unger&#39;s fonts tend to go well with Chinese
    - maybe Japanese too? <BR> <BR>I can think of a few display-type things &#40;like
    Jared&#39;s Yazuka and Want&#39;s Fusaka&#41;, as well as some perhaps overly-literal
    text faces &#40;like Hiroshige&#41;, but my favorite example of subtlety is this:

    in the Latin match it so well. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I think I am considering Brioso Pro. <BR> <BR>I just got it from Adobe, and
    it feels like it might fit just right. Very caligraphic, and lots of great alternates.
    <BR> <BR>I am really not interested in a companion to a Japanese face, nor am
    I interested IN a Japanese face, but more so a latin face, that would be complimentary
    to a japanese motif. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to play with Brioso and see how its
    fits. <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

  body: Hello Kyle... <BR> <BR>I think anything that&#39;s very calligraphic in the
    Western tradition might not work so well. Eastern and Western calligraphy are
    just so different in style and spirit. I&#39;d like to see your CD cover design,
    if you don&#39;t mind, in order to give you any meaningful suggestions... You
    need a display face, am I correct? You probably want something that&#39;s more
    obviously Japanese in flavour, without being too clich
