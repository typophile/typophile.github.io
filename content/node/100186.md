body: "Forgive me if this question gets posted here all the time. I'm coming to the
  end of my dissertation for a DMA (Doctorate of Musical Arts), and it has come to
  my attention recently that apparently only squares and idiots use Times New Roman
  ever ever ever. I'd like to not be a square or idiot, but I also need something
  that (even I know this phrase is heard too often) \"looks like Times New Roman.\"
  I.e. conservative, serif, doesn't draw attention to itself. Doesn't look clever
  or pretentious. I'd love to use Garamond, especially given that my dissertation
  is about a 1627 piece of music, but its italic Qs give me pause.\r\n\r\nFurther,
  I'd like to not just be novel, but readable, especially on screen, since if anybody
  eventually reads this dissertation it will probably be electronically.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your time!"

  body: "The piece is Carlo Farina's <em>Capriccio Stravagante</em>, which uses violin-family
    instruments to imitate things like trumpets, shawms, hurdy-gurdies, cats and dogs.\r\n\r\nI
    should also mention that the official formatting instructions, while leaving it
    open to \"an appropriate typeface,\" also specify margins of 1.5 inch top and
    1.5 left (1 right and bottom), which makes for a narrower than usual page, and
    \"a 10 pt minimum for the text.\" Right now I'm using 11 pt for body and 10 pt
    for footnotes.\r\n\r\nAlso that of course free is good, and that I've tried Lido
    STF, and for whatever reason it just does not render well on my screen at 11 pt
    and 88% document size! Near illegible.\r\n\r\nMy Garamond just says \"Garamond.\"
    It's not something I paid for, so either standard with Win 7 or Office Pro 2010.
    It's not the italic Q <em>per se</em>, though that's what I noticed most. It's
    just that I don't want anybody saying, \"Hey, this isn't TNR, is it?\" Plus, although
    I'm a sucker for extremely overt faces (as an early music person I make heavy
    use of Chapbook), for my money Garamond isn't as screen-friendly as TNR. Oh, and
    maybe it's just because I used it a lot in undergrad, but for some reason Palatino
    feels amateurish to me.\r\n\r\nThanks for the Brill tip; I'll try that out."

    Fleischmann would be better, although it would be hard to translate its eclecticism
    to the screen.\r\n\r\nBTW a measure of 7\" might be narrower that we're (sadly)
    used to seeing on a letter-size page, but it's not narrow in terms of good readability;
    in fact at 10 point it's probably too wide (so it's good you're using 11 - you
    could even go to 12 with something like Baskerville).\r\n\r\nPalatino: part of
    its problem is the x-height being too big - it's really not a bona fide text face.
    Try Aldus, its more bookish sister.\r\n\r\nBut let me understand: you want something

    even if confusability with Times is indeed a desirable parameter.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, most laymen are shockingly insensitive to differences in fonts that we consider
    chasmic, at least consciously. I always fondly remember the story of the test
    subject in a legibility study being asked to compare Georgia to some other serif
    font, and saying something like \"This Times looks bigger than that Times.\"  :-)\r\n\r\nAnd
    this can extend beyond laymen as well. I remember the first time I made a high-quality
    output of my Patria* at a service bureau, I eagerly asked the owner what she thought
    of it: she felt a little bit put on the spot, because she confessed to thinking
    it wasn't much different than Times... And I almost hugged her, because that's

    case wound up hand-inking some notes because he wasn't equipped to print two pitches

    with a couple of other composers, but he seemed to be financially comfortable,

    If the the Brill fonts that John Hudson mentioned seem to meet all your needs

    It occurs to me it could be fun to try to find something--at least for headers,
    perhaps--inspired by Bergen's typeface; it can be seen [[http://digital.slub-dresden.de/werkansicht/dlf/823/5/cache.off|here,]]
