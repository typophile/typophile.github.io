body: "Dear forum,\r\n\r\ni'm working on a really large script font with 80 ligatures
  and a number of alternates, so there are currently about 28.000 kerning pairs. I
  made a similar font before and everything worked well. Now i do not find a way to
  avoid the [FATAL] warning as a result of compiling the OpenType features: GPOS feature
  'kern' causes overflow of offset to a subtable (0x1ce1e).\r\n\r\nHere is what i
  tried again and again during the last days before generating and compiling the kern
  feature:\r\n- expand class kerning and reset kerning classes\r\n- let FL automatically
  generate new classes with different options selected, then compressed kerning\r\n-
  defined my own kerning classes\r\n- looked up the typophile forum for similar problems\r\n\r\nI'm
  using FontLab Studio 5.04 for Mac.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is help out there...\r\n\r\nHopefully,\r\n\r\nIngo"

  body: "Most likely, the problem resides in your own defined kerning classes. The
    likely culprit is a duplicate glyph in two or more of your classes. \r\n\r\nWe
    ran into this problem recently and found that the ae glyph was present in its
    own class (left and right position), and also present in a class e1 (e as the
    first or left glyph). Removing one of the instances solved the problem."

  body: "Thanks, for the answers. \r\nBut the classes are not the problem. FL itself
    doesn't find a problem within the classes, i also checked all classes myself.\r\nIn
    case of this script font i would omit classes, because there are only very few
    glyphs looking similar on one or both sides. But even if i expand class kerning
    to plain pair kerning and delete all classes, the problem remains. This raises
    the question \"are there any subtables in flat kerning?\"\r\nDoes anyone know
    what FL's output codes e.g. \"subtable (0x1ce1e)\" are meaning? Then it would
    be easy to find where the problem is, i think.\r\n\r\nHmmmm..."

  body: "Are we certain that this error pertains to GPOS, and not to the 'kern' table
    (and I do mean kern *table*, not subtable of GPOS)? This situation would make
    some sense if that is the case. There is a fundamental problem with the specification
    of the 'kern' table, in that the length descriptor is a 16-bit unsigned integer
    (USHORT) with maximum capacity of 65536. But the number of pairs is also given
    as a USHORT, while the length of each entry is 6 bytes. So the length field will
    overflow whenever there are more than 10922 flat pairs (actually I think it is
    less than that because of some header info). Some tools, including FontLab, choke
    on this situation. But again, it is specifically with the 'kern' table, not GPOS
    kerning. I think it is possible to toggle the use of a 'kern' table when generating
    in FL, perhaps try playing with that and see if it makes any difference?\r\n"

  body: "This is a pretty well-understood issue, and as Christoph pointed you towards
    in the first reply, you have too many classes within a single subtable, so you're
    breaking the 64K limit on the size of a subtable.\r\n\r\nI *think* FontLab supports
    the subtable break code from the AFDKO, in which case that's what you need to
    do (with switching over to AFDKO being more of a last resort). Christopher Slye
    or Miguel Sousa from my team could advise more on the detailed tactics of how
    to do this, if one of them stops by soon. They're both at TypeCon right now, but
    I expect they'll be back online in a day or two.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thanks a lot again for your answers.\r\n\r\nMy largest subtable at the moment
    contains the incredible number of over 8.000 lines. And i'm not yet finished with
    creating additional glyphs...\r\nAs i mentioned above, in this special font the
    number of classes is rather limited. And in most classes only two glyphs are contained,
    thus the number of subtables is very limited, too.\r\n\r\nThomas, i will try to
    get the newer AFDKO running... it seems to be the only promising way."

  body: "The newer AFDKO didn't solve it.\r\nNow i created new classes with  as many
    glyps in each class as possibe, even with glyphs whose forms that doesn't look
    similar at first sight. In this way i could reduce the number of kerning pairs
    down to 3.100 !!! Compressed to Class Kerning its only 1127 entries in the kern
    feature definition!!! Maybe i exaggerated it somewhat... but now there's no subtable
    overflow any more :-)\r\n\r\nBut FL S' output after compiling the OpenType features
    now shows the following: \r\n[WARNING] Start of new pair positioning subtable;
    some pairs may never be accessed: [... ...] [... ...]\r\n\r\nI think i can ignore
    that."

    The warning says <cite>Start of new pair positioning subtable; some pairs may

    care if all your kerning pairs show up when using the font.&nbsp;&nbsp;:D\r\n\r\nKarsten"
