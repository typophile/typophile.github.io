body: Hi all, can anyone help me with my search for a classy/sophisticated looking
  font which is either from or has the feel of 1920's? Preferably the later end of
  the 20's too. From what I've seen so far, the fonts from that period tend to be
  less sophistication and more entertaining!

    in 1927, although I'm not sure that captures the spirit of the 1920s.
