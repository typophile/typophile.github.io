    typeface that first make me want to enquire further into typography. To be precise,
    the uppercase G. People say its overused. Never. Misused, perhaps. ;&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Perpetua&#39;s proportions work so well with Gill Sans, and to my mind is
    a wonderful marriage. The italics are compact and beautiful.  <BR> <BR>Verdana
    looks great on screen, both aliased and antialiased, and its all down to its spacing.
    If you must read on screen, there is no finer read than 11pt verdana on a 72dpi
    screen. <BR> <BR>Sabon &#40;and Sabon Next&#41; are wonderfully legible and utterly
    handsome. The ligatures, swashes and alternatives add a depth and richness that

  body: As likely the only person here who has the same birthday as Massimo, I feel
    entitled to say I think the whole notion of limiting oneself to five typefaces
    is utter nonsense. I am constantly amazed that more designers don&#39;t share
    my very strong feeling that the content ought to heavily influence the design.
    Now, it may be that Massimo simply doesn&#39;t take projects that don&#39;t scream
    out for one of his fraternal quintuplets, but then, that would be pretty lazy.
    <BR> <BR>I go through phases wherein I&#39;m more inclined to try a particular
    couple of faces first &#40;or, like playing too much with a new toy, I overuse
    cool new fonts I&#39;ve just bought&#41;, but lordy -- to restrict oneself like
    that just boggles my mind. <BR> <BR>And finally, I will say that I appreciate
    John Hudson&#39;s comment about letterpress publishers. I can understand that
    a letterpress craftsperson could focus solely on one face, trying for all time
    to perfect the use of such face. Still, that is a radically different sort of
    design than what I and Massimo, my fellow birthday-boy, practice. <BR> <BR>Now,

    by slab serifs&#41; that I have no room to talk. The default font I use for memos
    and whatnot changes so often it makes Madonna look like the definition of permanence.
    <BR> <BR>However, the &#34;desert island&#34; kind of question is always interesting.
    Plus, as every kitchen or tool kit should be stocked with certain items, shouldn&#39;t
    a font set?

  body: 'Dave, you nailed it on the head there, and I do share your very strong feeling
    that the content ought to heavily influence the design <i>&#40;cut and paste makes
    me type faster ;&#41; &#41;</i>. The work of David Carson amongst others made
    me realize that the first thing you need to do when starting a design is to analyze
    the cultural and other demographics of your target audience &#40;whenever possible&#41;.
    The main reason why he got away with those difficult to read lay-outs is because
    his target audience was motivated. They didn&#39;t mind to put in the extra effort
    to decipher his pages because it just looked so friggin&#39; good and they were
    interested in the content. I like to see that as &#34;tribal design&#34;, where
    a certain style with its specific codes, symbols etc. is recognized by its target
    audience as being &#34;authentic&#34;. <i>&#40;I fear this might not be entirely
    clear but my English is failing me here&#41;.</i> <BR> <BR>As how I try to imply
    this way of working: for example the design with 7 or 8 typefaces to a page I
    was talking about in the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/5163.html?1044487157">
    Matchmaking...</a> thread was for an informative magazine aimed at parents with
    teenage kids, but it was implied in the brief that the magazine should be attractive
    and inviting to the teenagers as well so they would pick it up too. So my reader
    demographic was split into two definite chunks of teens and thirty-somethings.
    This made me approach the typography and colour scheme in a totally different
    way than the magazine for human resources managers that was entirely set in FF
    Info and FF Meta. <BR> <BR>These are the kind of challenges that make this graphic
    design thing <i>so</i> interesting. And I must say I can get sooo bored by these
    highbrow hotshot designers who persist in setting everything in Neue Helvetica
    55 9/12. The quote I really like about Schmelvetica is &#34;When in doubt, set
    in Helvetica. You&#39;re never right, but at least you&#39;re never wrong.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Oh, and before y&#39;all start yelling at me: I <i>do</i> occasionally
    use Helvetica. All I need is a very, very good reason and a watertight rationale.
    <BR> <BR>P.S. Isaac I thought I noticed a hint of sarcasm in your first post.

    earlier on&#41;, so I <i>was</i> motivated and interested. Carson&#39;s designs
    were perfectly suited for his target audience of angry alterno kids who were bored
    with Corporateling Stone Magazine. No-one can argue they didn&#39;t deserve their
    own forum. And some of the things he did were genius on a conceptual level. I
    mean: &#34;Article continued on cover&#34;? The Brian Ferry interview set in Zapf
    Dingbats? The doubled Cocteau Twins spread? What an eye openers! This made you
    <i>think</i>, and best of all it went on and on. And to top it all most of it
    was simply gorgeous! <BR> <BR>It&#39;s maybe because I&#39;m a kid of the Nineties
    and I&#39;m less aware of notorious predecessors of Brody and Carson, but what
    the heck. These guys taught me one of the most valuable lessons in graphic design:
    don&#39;t copy, but <b>analyze</b> how one comes to a particular end result and
    try to integrate the <b>thought process</b> in your work, not the style.'
