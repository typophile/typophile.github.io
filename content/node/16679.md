  you how long stuff like this takes me...\r\n\r\nAnyways, I'd love some feedback
  on this, it's for a very small business.  The bags that are being made are handbags
  / purses... thus the straps and the bottom of the graphic.\r\n\r\nI like this type
  of font, but not necessarily sold on this font in particular... any free alternatives
  that would be better?"

  body: Darker text would be an improvement. Eras is very 80's. Your logo looks computer
    generated. I would hand draw the strap and possibly the font. It doesn't have
    to be too complex, but it should be more illustrative.

  body: Yeah, it's kinda sterile now. Shire would be pretty cool. But what kind of
    bags are they? Are they really different or what? The personality of the bags
    should come through in the type/design, Maybe you should getsomebody to do a complex
    interlocking line drawing with the name 'woven' into  the shape of the bag. But
    it should depend on what you want to say.

    body: "Appreciate all of the replies...\r\n\r\nEben Sorkin - My design is a little
      sterile.  The bags are made with a sewing machine, and are made of canvas, with
      different style fabrics woven together. Attached is an example of one bag...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sampleBag.jpg]\r\n\r\nDan
      Weaver - Agree with you about the marketing... but the name's already chosen.
      So I wouldn't have any input in that aspect of it.  I'm just hoping to make
      the best of what this company already has.\r\n\r\nCannon46 - good ideas... are
      hand-drawn logos very common? What are some examples I could look at for direction?\r\n\r\nStephan
      Kurz - thanks for the detailed feedback.  If I stick with this current design,
      I'll definitely make the changes you mentioned."

  body: 'If you stick to that design and to the computer generated look, try different
    weights of the lines surrounding "by". Apart from that, the uc D in Design is
    sticking out too far to the left of the bottom black part compared to the N on
    the right. The D is also slanted too much if you want to keep the lines parallel.   '

  body: 'My problem is not with the design but with the marketing. You have to have
    a name with a label or it has no substance. As it stands now it has no creadibility.
    Its like saying: A baseball team by design (the baseball meetings were this week).
    Its never a baseball team by design, its the Yankees, the Red Sox etc. You need
    to establish a brand or you will fail, because its too generic.'

  body: 'Hand drawn logos are really common - Coca-cola was done by hand. But logos
    that look as if they were hand drawn because they look rough are less common.
    Still, less common could mean stading out. Fashion has a large # of hand drawn
    logos because signatures are used a great deal. Given the picture I think something
    funky & hand drawn is a good match to your bag''s feeling. There is alot of variety
    & expressiveness in hand drawing. Think about how you want the stroke to feel.
    Think or thin? Elegant or rough? '

  body: Looking at the type of bag you sell, your current logo really doesn't make
    the most of their features. They look colourful, lively, textured and alive. If
    you could create a logo (even with the name 'Bags by Design') with this type of
    feel, it would serve as a great advertisment!
