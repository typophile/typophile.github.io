  body: Once upon a time I was working on a movie poster project where we needed the
    &#34;PG-13&#34; artwork. I can no long find the link, but at the time I had found
    a page with all imaginable logos, in Illustrator format no less, which one might
    conceivably need. Has anyone else happened upon this? We&#39;re talking from the
    Disney DVD logo to Apex Digital to BBC Video to Dreamworks to Gramercy to IMAX
    to THX to Canadian/UK Ratings ... etc etc etc

    add anything new to the foray &#40;Tiffany was still looking for that site back
