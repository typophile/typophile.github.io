  inspiration was a typeface that emphasizes the Golden Section Page Rule, and the
  Alphabetum Romanum, I took some of the qualities displayed by Rotis Semi Serif,
  and Calibri.\r\n\r\nI'd really like to continue on this project, but it seems to
  have many structural flaws, which means lots of reworking to do, and that kinda
  turns me off..\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it worth continuing? do you have any idea to improve
  this typeface..???\r\n\r\nMy current hypothesis is this type has waaay to thin stem
  on it's lowercase and the serifs are fat and inelegant\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    by side with their partners. However a specimen with some running text (in english,
    for example) would help me judge your work better.\r\n\r\nRegards."

  body: "I agree with you that the stems on the lowercase are far too thin (they look
    a little brittle) but the caps are lovely and elegant with beautifully judged
    serifs. \r\n\r\nso, maybe not a body text font yet, but I would say definitely
    worth continuing, I like it a lot.\r\n\r\none thing; the serifs on the uppercase
    T; they are quite different to the others??? in scale, mostly..."
