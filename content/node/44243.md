  aqua clearly has some impact on quality font development (how else to explain that
  Adobe and MS live there?) I've decided to take a trip up to Seattle, imminently.
  Actually my reasons are largely non-typographic, but of course any significant travel
  calls for the rousing of the local font freaks, so I'm hoping that some of you...
  Seattlenos are game. I will be free* at least this coming Friday night, probably
  Sunday morning, as well as possibly late Saturday night. And just maybe Thursday
  night, if you promise not to overly frighten the non--type-geeks (non-type--geeks?)
  I'll be hanging out with at that time. Right. As you were.\r\n\r\n* Requisite asterisk.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    is that the apparent fixture of rain will damped my experience. Otherwise I have
    high expectations, especially since apparently even New Englanders seem to think
    the seafood there has no equal. Well, except maybe Japan.\r\n\r\nSimon, if I tell
    you too much, I will have to kill you. Actually I'll be staying in... Redmond
    (major hint) on Wednesday and Thursday nights, while Friday and Saturday are still
    open. I might actually end up over the border on Saturday. What number can I call
    you at? Please email me if you like: hpapazian_at_gmail_dot_com. And that goes

    date. I suggest you eat at Nishino. Or possibly the Harvest Vine. I think they
    are both still upholding their high standards. Si, have you been?

  body: "Eben, thanks to your Harvest Vine recommendation Simon and I ended up at
    Txori*, the more casual sister. The portion sizes were like footnotes, but the
    tastes were like... Raffia Initials.\r\n\r\n* http://www.txoribar.com/\r\n\r\nOn
    Saturday morning I drove up to New Westminster (through a freak snow storm - very
    pretty though) and although I was prepared to be impressed by Jim, I was still
    impressed. We spent an intense five hours using the pantograph (actually two of
    them), casting type, and punchcutting. Rarefied experiences that I might never
    again have; lessons that will stay with me for a long time. Some photos:\r\n\r\nFirst,
    Jim, in one corner of his workshop. On the left side of the photo is one pantograph,
    for going from a cardboard inset drawing of about 9 inches to a lead plate of
    about 3; on the right side is the other pantograph, for going from the lead plate
    to an actual-size matrix.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jim_4852.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    lead plate, from a wonderful drawing by Jim. You should see the \"g\"!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/plate_5793.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    matrix (16 pt):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mat1_5231.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    finally the cast type!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cast_4413.jpg]\r\n\r\nPart
    2.\r\nA punch of a \"J\" that I made. Puts Neuland to shame!  :-/\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/punch_4532.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    the matrix struck from it:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mat2_6690.jpg]\r\n\r\nSomething
    funny happened to the punch, and the resultant matrix impression, upon striking,
    probably due to the punch being not fully hardened. In the end my \"J\" had become
    italic! Two glyphs with one stone, eh? Enjoy.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    burin can often make the most sense.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    thinking of the Van Krimpen argument here BTW.\r\n\r\nThose are great images.
    Was that made with a point and shoot or a dedicated lens? Or a fancy gizmo?"

  body: "Well, some purists think even the counterpunch is blasphemous! They say the
    file and burin are all you should use. I'm no fan of the pantograph-only approach
    (even though even that can make sense sometimes) but type design is a craft, and
    as such needs to serve people more than serve one's own artistic urges, so efficiency
    is very important. The pantograph, in a hybrid process with manual \"post-processing\"
    can be a great contributor to optimal results. In the wrong hands however it can
    debase type design, like how optical scaling went out the window pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the photos, it's amusing -and gratifying- that you're reading so much into
    my camera setup! :-)  They were taken with my lowly Ricoh RDC-7*, no tripod, lousy
    lighting. On a wooden tray in my lap. The secret is the RDC-7's amazing macro,
    which can get as close as 1 cm (less than 1/2 an inch). Even with it's very modest
    3.7 megapixel resolution that translates to over 2000 dpi. With a tripod and proper
    lighting it can do quite an amazing job, especially for its age. And it has some
    other unique features. I love the little thing, although it's getting a bit ragged.\r\n\r\n*
