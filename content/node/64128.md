body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nWe have some label printing software that we are replacing (called
  Optio), and we need to be able to duplicate the font it is using.  It is old software,
  and has no obvious clues as to what the name of the font is.  We've tried a number
  of automatic font identifying sites with no luck, and are hoping that actual humans
  can help :)\r\n\r\nSorry the picture quality isn't the greatest.  It is essentially
  all black (no shading at all) and very angular.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/asdf_3836.png]"

    for \"pixel\" as a tag at myfonts.com or for similar tags or themes on the usual
    freefont sites, eg. abstractfonts.com or \r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/bitmap.php"
