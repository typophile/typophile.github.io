  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Friends,</p>
<p>Hello! I&rsquo;m the managing director of a small non-profit arts organization that performs, teaches, and hosts dance and movement events. We&rsquo;re the only modern dance studio in Indiana, where there is a small (at best) dance community. Although we&rsquo;ve been around for 28 years, we are frequently being compared to the local ballet school; a more classical dance and has been around for 50 years.</p>
<p>A few years ago, (before I worked here) the organization got a grant to improve its corporate branding. They bought a font (DaVinci) and created a logo (attached).</p>
<p>I came along, with a minimal graphic design background, and I don&rsquo;t like the logo. It seemed to open, to unsubstantial. So I modified it, inversed the color, and set it inside a circle (also attached.)</p>
<p>The 30th anniversary is coming up soon, and I&rsquo;d really like to present them with a modified, better logo that isn&rsquo;t drastically different that what is here. I&rsquo;d like it to show a sense of movement, of flow. I&rsquo;d like it to be free-form without being wacky and all over the place. Basically, I want to keep a sense of modern dance within the logo, but I want something that will still look smart on a letterhead.</p>
<p>I would love any advice you have to offer that might lead me on the right path. Thank you very much!</p>

<p>A good test for a mark is to reduce it to around 1/4&quot; in height and fax it and see if it still reads. I would simplify the ideas and look to available type that is going to be more legible.</p>
<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t even need the two figures. Maybe type only, or just a gesture that says movement. Maybe that gesture could be part of the type.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments! I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of just getting rid of the logo itself, but I don&rsquo;t know if the artistic director would be down for that. Do you think it would be improved by removing the little spirals and the little confetti-looking marks?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Andrew.</p>
<p>Maybe you should zoom into the figures and take a part of a body that keeps the essence/movement [moving hand/torso/muscle structure&hellip;], or take a piece of clothing they could be wearing [twisted shirt/tie/a dress suggesting the movement of the body underneeth&hellip;] Something that has a place in the imege already but could be isolated and refined, croped in and made more powerful. [?]</p>
<p>Maybe take a photo of two people performing this movement and take a detail and work with it&hellip; you could even have an evolving mark that zooms closer and ends up with an abstract shape [body part/clothing/hair&hellip;] that conveys the same message as this one does holistically.</p>
<p>I find that a photograph or something tangible is a good starting point when designing anything, even type. Then you can usually give it a physical quality: weight, texture, movement. Then a simple shape can be attributed to a space or material or somehow suggest a material quality, be it finely chipped out of steel [Walbaum] or set in huge concrete blocks [Akzidenz Grotesk figures]. Or something like the Johnnie Walker logo.</p>
