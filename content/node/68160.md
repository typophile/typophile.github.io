  is doing my thesis now,\r\nMy thesis is about signage system in a 3-d form/ structure.\r\n\r\nand
  is in search of a nice serif font to go with the system.\r\nI am working on the
  sketch for the structure now.\r\n\r\nbut I am wondering if anyone has information
  on the fonts choice that's \r\nsuitable for such project? \r\nnicely defined san
  serif fonts and maybe with some variations?\r\n\r\nany reply is greatly appreciated.
  again,\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks all,\r\neric"
