  body: ' I think they work pretty well. <BR>I can think of a few tweaks here and
    there, but the biggest thing is the bottom serif of the &#34;7&#34;: too jarring.
    Solution? I can&#39;t seem to think of one...  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Try this: <BR>The foot serif of the &#34;7&#34; might be fixed by narrowing
    it slightly and smoothing the bracketing. Use the &#34;4&#34; as a guide, as much
    as feasible, only make it slightly wider. <BR> <BR>Good luck! The numeral set
    looks like a nice solution overall. <BR> <BR>David '

    it some more and see what I can come up with. Thanks. '
