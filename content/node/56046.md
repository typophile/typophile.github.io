  body: Looks pretty handlettered. Do you have any evidence that it actually was produced
    by software?

  body: "I think Raymond (microspective) is right that it's probably handlettered.
    What would prove otherwise is to see more lettering in the same style, where we
    can see repeats of the same letters.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for commercial
    alternatives, you might check out the scripts of [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/leuschke/|Rob
    Leuschke]] (at MyFonts), or the work of [[http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=Alejandro%20Paul&producttype=TYP&resulttab=vr&category=Type|Alejandro
    Paul at Veer]], or Sudtipos.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "That last sample makes a stronger case that this is a font, and I really
    think it looks like many of Rob Leuschke's works. If so, it must be something
    that he does not sell through MyFonts. I just checked [[http://www.typesetit.com/enter.html|his
    own site]] and didn't see this either, so it's a mystery to me. He may have drawn
    a custom font for the stationer where you saw these samples.\r\n\r\nYou could
    write to him and ask. I've done this before and he responded.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    be the texture of the paper. I'd still be willing to bet this is custom lettering.\r\n\r\n
