  in Smeijers's <em>Counterpunch</em> pp. 99-100, we find:\r\n<blockquote>It is a
  safe rule that [the punchcutter] should do nothing without a correct understanding
  of the design of the letters, or having good models before him to allow him to catch
  the fashion of them, and to make such alterations as he thinks necessary. For example,
  such an alteration has lately been made in the case of capital letters, whose angles
  have been squared to give an effect of lightness, whereas they were formerly somewhat
  concave, which gave the letters a heavier appearance. The same thing has been done
  to all the angles of the lowercase letters.</blockquote>\r\nCan anyone help me understand
  just what \"angles\" have gone from \"concave\" to \"square\"? I have a hard time
  following the referents in this verbal description."

    I wondered.\r\n\r\nThe Didot typeface wasn't started until 1784. And even Baskerville
    was only designed in 1757 - but it did not have the unbracketed serifs characteristic
    of modern faces, even if it had other characteristics of theirs in incipient form.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the Romain du Roi dates from 1693. Whew!"

  body: "<em>It may refer to removal of bracketing, so all the corners are clean and
    sharp, rather than rounded</em>\r\n\r\nI think Bill is right \u2013 I\u2019ve
    never understood it well myself, but now it seems to me a key passage. Fournier
    did this \u2018removal of bracketing\u2019 with his own capitals, especially the
    larger sizes that were used for drop initials or titling. It is not so noticeable
    in the text sizes of the <em>romain du roi</em> (for which the engraved \u2018drawings\u2019
    all show bracketing), but here is an initial for casting on a body of 96 Didot
    points, from the specimen of the Imprimerie royale printed in 1760.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1
    A - triple gros canon - Imp roy 1760 - 500_6432.jpg]\r\n\r\nOne also needs to
    reckon with the influence of the clean, sharp effect of big letters engraved as
    outlines on copper and then filled in, even if they then get bracketing added,
    as in this example from Diderot\u2019s <em>Encyclop\xE9die.</em>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2
    Gravure - Encycl - 1 b copy bw - det - 500_3728.jpg]\r\n\r\nThat engraved line
    helps to shape the serif that eventually gets into both the capital and small
    letters of the new types. It is there in Fleischmann in the 1730s and the Didot
    types in the 1780s.\r\n\r\nA note on dates. None of the punches of the <em>romain
    du roi</em> was cut before 1696, and the process of making it went on for decades.
    That big A was made by Grandjean\u2019s successor Alexandre in 1730. \r\n"

  body: "I thought it might be worth putting this image up here, more as a contribution
    to this discussion than because I have certain answers to some of the questions
    it raises. It is one of some remaining punches that are believed to survive from
    the type that eventually became known as 60-point Caslon Old Face, one of the
    big sizes on which Matthew Carter\u2019s \u2018Big Caslon\u2019 is based (another
    was the 72-point). As can be seen, the face is badly corroded. Both big sizes
    were recut in the later 19th century, apparently to make a smoother design and
    to strike matrices that would fit type-casting machines. (I told the story at
    some length in my <em>Typefoundry</em> blog http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2009/01/recasting-caslon-old-face.html.)
    We do not know exactly when these two large sizes of Caslon were made. Their first
    known appearance in a type specimen appears to be in 1764, and neither showing
    includes letter \u2018m\u2019. Maybe some earlier examples can be found in contemporary
    printing. But if this is an original Caslon punch, then as can be seen, it has
    unbracketed, or almost unbracketed, serifs with rather odd reverse angles at their
    ends. Judging from specimens other recut lower-case characters seem to have similar
    serifs, though not the capitals.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Caslon
    4P m punch 8 aa bw b sh - 450_5083.jpg]\r\n\r\nMaybe I should add as a footnote
    that if these big sizes were known in early specimens as Four- and Five-line Pica
    (as they were), and Pica was about 12 points, it might be asked how they came
    to be known as 60 and 72 point. The answer seems to be that big sizes like this
    were originally cast with kerned descenders, rather like some later wood types,
    so that their capitals were in effect \u2018titling\u2019 letters, occupying most
    of the body, which was indeed equivalent to four or five lines of Pica. Presumably
    one put a support of some kind under the kerned descenders of the lower-case g,
    j, p, q and y, and capital Q too, to stop them bending or breaking. Later, at
    the beginning of the 20th century, they were cast on the larger bodies of 60 and
    72 points.\r\n"
