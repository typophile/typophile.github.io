body: "First of all, can anyone suggest some similar fonts to this book cover for
  American Born Chinese?  \r\nSecond, the reason I'm asking is because I'm looking
  for a fat, graphic novel style font with a low center of gravity -- i.e., the vertical
  cross in the A or the H is low-down, below the middle of the letter -- so my second
  question is, is there a design name for that low-gravity quality in a font?  SO
  grateful for answers or even suggestions -- thanks!  Sossabell [img:sites/default/files/old-images/americanborn_4066.png]"

    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bonita/\">Bonita</a> that has been
    graphically squooshed, or edited to make the lettering fit the spaces.\r\n\r\n-
