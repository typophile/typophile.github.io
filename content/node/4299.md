  body: I think citi is a custom version of interstate. Their banking centers use
    customized insterstate for everything. <BR> <BR>I think the monospaced campaign
    font is also custom. <BR> <BR>Randy

  body: The campaign broke in 2000 from Fallon after they won the account. <BR> <BR>At
    any rate <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=1082002431673390&amp;fontname=Interstate">Interstate</a>
    is the place to start. <BR>Or even <a href="http://web.brandsoftheworld.com/?id=112&amp;action=1&amp;text=citi">faster</a>.
