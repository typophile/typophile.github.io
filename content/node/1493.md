  body: How about <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/luggage/" target="_blank">&#39;Luggage&#34;</a>  or
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/phuture-odc/" target="_blank"> &#34;Phuture
    ODC&#34;</a> from T-26? &#40;In their oblique/italic versions, of course.&#41;
    The Phuture looks like a closer match.
