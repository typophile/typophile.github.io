body: "I'm working on a logo for an outdoor sculpture route in a small city. The logo
  is completely typographical and consists of good ol' Franklin Gothic. My client
  is due back next week and I'd like to show him some alternatives to Franklin Gothic.
  I'm looking for something that says: \r\n\r\nmodern, \r\n21st century,\r\ncity,
  \r\nserious, \r\nlegible, \r\nnot too quirky. \r\n\r\nSans and \r\ndifferent weights
  are required.\r\n\r\nFor the moment I'm through with TheSans and Unit.\r\n\r\nAny
  takers?"

  body: "Thanks for your ideas all!\r\n\r\nLocator, Gotham Rounded, Bryant, Alright
    Sans and Replica are beautiful, but too regular looking.\r\n\r\nI like Orbit from
    Village and love /A/ in it, but it is too technical.\r\n\r\nGravur Condensed I
    do like very much and is certainly on my shortlist.\r\n\r\nI guess when I'm looking
    at Nick's diagram, it could be nearer to the far right and/or lower right corner
    rather then the upper right corner.\r\n\r\nThe logo is set totally in caps and
    should last for at least three years.\r\n\r\nkind regards,\r\nJean Paul\r\n\r\n"

    It may fit the bill for your logo project.

    years is a mere blip.\r\n\r\nSorry, I don't see anything wrong with Lato (or your
    recommendation of it).* Although there <em>is</em> a correlation between quality
    and price (and it's relatively strong in the field of type design) being open-source
    does not <em>guarantee</em> low quality... Especially when it comes from the person
    who made FF Pitu:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/ff-pitu/\r\n\r\n*
    And in case you think I'm changing my tune as needed, here's what I wrote in that
    thread <em>you</em> linked to: http://typophile.com/node/77283#comment-487496\r\n\r\nWhat
    bugs me is that you <em>know</em> I don't automatically damn open-source efforts
    (because of our recent exchange concerning Source Sans Pro) but you still take
    advantage and attack somebody who says <em>anything</em> bad about open-source
    fonts, even if it's clearly true (for example that they're generally poorly spaced).
    This is not behavior I consider honorable.\r\n\r\nNeither, BTW is deleting self-incriminating
    posts... And now I'm starting to doubt the story of why you removed the \"2,000+\"
    the other day...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    done that. Contrary to your general beliefs, most of us don't post for your amusement.
    I figured if he hadn't found a font for his logo in three years, the client would
    have gone elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut nothing anyone says stops you from getting your
    count up, eh?\r\n\r\n"
