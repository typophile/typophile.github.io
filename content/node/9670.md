  body: It looks SO familiar... I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s that same font they use
    for EA Sports&#39; Madden, etc. line of games but I can&#39;t place the name!

  body: Ryan, are you thinking of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/aurora/">Aurora</a>?
    It does have some similar characteristics, but not quite a match.

  body: It all boils down to the fact that those soccer jerseys and other  <BR>sports
    merchandising are big business, so it pays off to have  <BR>them be as difficult
    as possible to copy, hence the use of custom  <BR>designed logos and proprietary
    typefaces. It&#39;s no coincidence  <BR>we rarely are able to identify typefaces
    on these kind of items.
