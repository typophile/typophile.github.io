  body: "Where is the A and the M? Do you have other samples?\r\n\r\nI was thinking
    of Univers Bold Condensed, too. But the R is a little off. Whatever this is it
    was probably (I could be wrong) some standard font that was often used by printers. "

  body: Might well be one of many helvetica/standard derivates used by printshops
    that never made it digital... Better bet is to go for something close, and see
    if you can modify it accordingly. There are so many of these fonts out there,
    thats it's very hard to find exactly this one. But good luck if you want to keep
    trying... Try searching MyFonts or Identifont for similar fonts to Helvetica condensed.
    And remind yourself that this is from the sxties, so you can exlude a lot of younger
    helveticans.

    the buttons on their vendomat is just fun.
