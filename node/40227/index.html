  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I bought Fontographer in the 90s, did some type design, then moved on to other things, and haven&rsquo;t touched FOG since. I want to get back into type design, so I&rsquo;m wondering which makes more sense: upgrading to FOG 4.7 or getting TypeTool. Either option would cost me $99, and since it&rsquo;s been so long since I&rsquo;ve used FOG, I&rsquo;m not concerned about having to re-learn anything by moving to TypeTool. I know FOG should have some more features than TT, but after looking at the product comparison chart, they look really equal (with TT ahead in some features).</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m more or less a beginner at this point, I don&rsquo;t need super advanced features, and TT seems like a more modern program, and  maybe a bit easier to use, and if I ever decided to upgrade to Fontlab, I&rsquo;d already know how to use the program.</p>
<p>Anyone have any recommendations?</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

While I don&rsquo;t wish to cause the Fontlab people any grief, but do consider [[http://fontforge.sf.net/|FontForge]].
It&rsquo;s a little awkward and messy in some respects, notably that you have to get it working in X11 or Cygwin rather than native operating environments (unless you&rsquo;re on a Linux box), but the features are more than good enough and it&rsquo;s not going to cost you anything for trying.</div>

<p>James, what limitations of TT caused you to upgrade to FL? After reading the comparison charts, and trying out the demos, I still  can&rsquo;t quite tell what the limitations of TT and FOG are compared to each other.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend the upgrade to FOG rather than TypeTool. The latter has limitations, such s restricted transform effects (that for me make it quite useless). In that regard FOG has much more capability and is a far simpler program to use than either FontLab or TT. FOG can&rsquo;t create fonts in the OT format but if that is necessary FOG databases can be ported over to TypeTool Pro or FontLab with FogLamp.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Drawing in Typetool can be a big pain, especially when it comes to building up shapes from strokes. The lack of transform effects Gerald Mentioned can be bothersome. Lack of autotracing was a big problem, because what Livetrace generates is next to worthless for lettering, but Fontlab can be a huge timesaver when I want to build up a complex letter without using the pen tools. That might not matter to serious type designers who don’t trace, but I’m a student and have to cut corners when time is really tight. There were other things, but it’s been a few months and I can’t really remember them now.</p>
<p>On the upside, Fontlab will issue you a refund for Typetool to upgrade to Fontlab within three months of purchase. So you can always start with Typetool and upgrade later.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">There is one other thing to throw into ones hopper as one consider a purchase. If ones 90&rsquo;s experience with FOG was pre-4.0, there is no current upgrade to what you were drawing with. After 3.x, &lsquo;Macromedia&rsquo; re-interfaced FOG to &lsquo;match&rsquo; Freehand, the previous interface was discontinued, (So you may be starting from scratch, UI experience-wise, regardless of your choice).

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My situation is similar to yours. I hadn&rsquo;t touched Fontrapher in years, and then I found out there was an upgrade. I just happened to be interested in doing a font, so I upgraded.</p>
<p>After upgrading there were a few things that bugged me about the program, like not being able to cut and paste from Illustrator very well. Maybe I needed a newer version of Illustrator, but I couldn&rsquo;t do a straight cut and paste into Fontographer. I also wanted the capability of making OpenType fonts. Lastly, I&rsquo;m one of those very very rare people that spent years on Macs and got converted to the PC. I preferred to work in Windows, but the Fontographer upgrade was for Macs.</p>
<p>So, I upgraded to FontLab Studio and I&rsquo;m really pleased with it.</p>
