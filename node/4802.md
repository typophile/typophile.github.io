  body: Looks very much like an old metal version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/torino/urw-d-normal/testdrive.html?s=gulelor%20apartine&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> Torino</a>. <BR>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a digital text
    version available, <BR>as the URW version has a very high contrast and is  <BR>obviously
    meant for large point sizes. Bitstream has  <BR>a version with a little less contrast
    available under  <BR>the monicker <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/industrial-736/industrial-736/testdrive.html?s=gulelor%20apartine&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> Industrial 736</a>, but it&#39;s not a text version  <BR>neither
    as it&#39;s still a pretty high contrast face.
