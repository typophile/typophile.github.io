body: "I've upgraded Fontlab to 5.1.2 and my Mac to 10.8.1 and (now?) no kerning classes
  are working.\r\n\r\nExisting files have stopped working; existing sets work for
  only the main glyph, and new/fresh attempts fail as well.\r\n\r\nTypical sets look
  like this for my existing file left-side classes:\r\n_VW_L: V' W Wacute Wcircumflex
  Wdieresis Wgrave\r\n\r\nThis had been working perfectly for the last few years of
  development.\r\n\r\nSo I've tried this:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Make a new file with only
  A, V, and W\r\n\u2022 Drew new shapes in each (no copy, all new info and shapes)\r\n\u2022
  Built a kerning class called _V with _V: V' W as the class\r\n\u2022 Went to Kerning
  Mode and typed AVAWA\r\n\u2022 Dragged the second A towards the V\r\n\r\nThe A is
  closer to the V as I moved it, but the third A doesn't move closer to the W\r\n\r\nExpanding
  the kerning classes fixes the missing pairs, but with errors so I cannot output
  successfully (and I shouldn't have to flatten to get this work, right?).\r\n\r\nAll
  existing classes do not work for previous files\u2014so I'm a bit out of sorts.\r\n\r\nDid
  I forget something? Miss the obvious code marker? Argh!\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n "

    in this table, they don\u2019t all work, and the A_V is where it breaks down.\r\nAt

  body: "Thanks, Nick. The problem isn't with any particular set or class, it's all
    classes, in all cases now. The _V class was just a test example where the class
    had a set of five, for a total of five pairs in the entire test font, and it still
    failed.\r\n\r\nFlattening out isn't what I'm after as I cannot check any class
    kerning for accuracy for diacritics or like-style glyphs\u2014which is the point
    of class kerning. My final projects have been successful with 50,000+ pairs, no
    errors; now that effort is not working.\r\n"

    After years with this program, you'd think I'd know 'bout that switch.\r\n\r\nMany,
    many thanks. I'd hoped it was just something I did.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
