  font selection/pairing: Am I crazy, or do these two really look quite happy (or
  at least interesting, and definitely not bad) together? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whitman-fedra-1_3862.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whitman-fedra-2_4169.gif]\r\nTo
  my eye, they seem to click &ndash; in an interesting and not quite friction-less
  way. Maybe beyond the surface differences of their curves, they share some \"deeper\"
  character traits that make them work together &ndash; a certain tautness/springiness
  maybe, which of course is much more overt in Fedra (which is fine, since it's playing
  the display part here)?\r\nBut does that make any sense, or am I over-brainalyzing
  things? \r\nMy eyes say it's good, they think, but I'm not sure.\r\n.\r\nIn any
  case, of the faces FB recommends as being \"compatible\" with Whitman, I only have
  a couple weights of ITC Franklin, and that looks a bit lazy/plump next to Whitman
  (& nothing against Franklin, I'm using it in a different book currently where it
  works great).\r\n.\r\nIn any case, Kent, if I haven't said it before, congratulations,
  and thanks &ndash; Whitman is truly a thing of beauty, and already a joy to work
  with! :-)"

    a in 'Beautiful' is almost a separate word.\r\nBut \u2014 I think you're right.
    The forms click really neatly. \r\n\r\nI think the line space could have something
    to do with it...have you added more leading?"

    it on that level of detail yet. I basically just threw the fonts on the page to
    see if they'd click. (I'm glad you agree they do!)\r\n\r\n<cite>\"I think the

    I have, but where do you mean? Between the title & subtitle?\r\n\r\nFrode, yes
    this is Fedra Sans (Pro) Alt. Less quirky than the regular version."

  body: Yes but also in the running text below. The line space gives the text lots
    of breathing room. What I mean is that the line space:x-height ratio looks very
    comparable for the title and text.

  body: I think the body leading improves the match of Fedra and Whitman. Fedra is
    always elegant when given breathing room, and Whitman's counterforms seem to breathe
    as well...

  body: I think this is proof that font pairing isn't a science like some students
    and beginners want to believe it is. There are not really any hard rules about
    what typeface looks good with another.

  body: "@Stephen, really? This is really interesting. There must be combinations
    that just look bad no matter what? (I know that's not quite what you said.)\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, aren't the  and 'tonal' characteristics of fonts (such as voice,
    connotation) reducible to their structural characteristics (such as a similar
    ductus or stress angle)?"

    as voice, connotation) reducible to their structural characteristics (such as
    a similar ductus or stress angle)?\"</cite>\r\n\r\nI'd think the example in this
    thread (if it does work) disproves this (maybe depending on your definition of
    \"structural characteristics\").\r\nIt seems like a classic approach to pair faces
    that share a similar historical lineage, stress angle, construction principle,
    overall proportions, stuff like that. Seen from that angle, I actually don't think
    that Whitman and Fedra are <em>very</em> much alike; but for some reason (and
    I can only really hint at some similar \"attitude\", or <em>posture</em> maybe
    if you think of them as humans) they still seem to relate to each other here.
    \r\nIt drives me nuts, but I really can't pinpoint <em>why</em> &ndash; I think
    I've reached the point where the way I can talk about what I'm doing gets all
    touchy-feely-mystical. :-\\\r\n\r\nIn any case, I agree with Stephen: There are
    so many variables that can provide the \"link\" between two typefaces, as long
    as the \"tone\" is right. Of course there are still pairings that don't work well.
    Many. Actually, this outlook makes it harder to combine fonts, if anything, because
    it's less about following a given recipe. (And having fewer \"hard rules\", as
    safety nets, makes it harder to trust one's eyes &ndash; which is probably also
    why I posted this here.)\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nAnyway, yes, I felt I wanted to give
    Whitman some extra leading, to give its extenders some room to well, extend. :-)
    It feels like a generous face and I don't want to squeeze it onto the page. And
    also because the measure might end up being a bit long. \r\nBut all that hasn't
    really been carefully figured out yet &ndash; please see this thing above as a
    raw sketch of sorts."

    Ben: I hate to say this (because I *heart* Fedra too) but there really is a bit
    of unexpected bumpiness in the spacing. At least if you use the small caps, prepare
    to do some manual kerning. It's not bad \u2013 it's just not extremely, utterly
    perfect. ;)"

  body: "Interesting, what makes you say \xABunexpected\xBB? They are rather cursive
    in structure, yes \u2013 minus things like the \xABg\xBB; and they retain angularity/rigidity
    in detail, which keeps them from being overly soft. Actually Whitman overall has
    some slightly \xABoldstyle\xBB/bookish details that I find quite charming, like
    a slanting hyphen! But it's not affected \u2013 it's genuine, and I enjoy how
    it brings together these details with an overall fresh and clean feel.\r\nBTW,
    for the record, the large type in the headings is Whitman Display.\r\n\r\nFedra's
    spacing: Dunno \u2013 like I said, I don't want to make it sound worse than it
    is."

  body: Hmm, I was expecting the italic have more swashy/curly hairlines like a Bodoni
    or Baskerville. Whitman's italic is more tasteful somehow, like you say, more
    determined/restrained/rigid than other moderns and transitionals.
