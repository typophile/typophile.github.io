  inspector for 28 years. She would like this fact to some-how be incorperated in
  the design. I agree with her 100%, but I'm having trouble with the phrasing.\r\nWhat
  would sound better:\r\n\r\n1) With over 25 years of experience in city codes\r\n2)
  With over 25 years experience in city codes\r\n3) With over 25 years city codes
  experience\r\n\r\nThat's all I can think of for now. But if there are any other
  ways of phrasing it I'm welcome to any and all suggestions. Also would like suggestion
  on how to type it. Is 'city codes' hyphenated?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nIvan"

  body: Ivan, could you post up a mock-up of it so we could have a look at the whole
    thing?  I've got some ideas, but I'd like to see it "in the flesh" so to speak....  ;-)

  body: "A fine can of worms here. Since you can use a telegraphic style in a resume,
    you could theoretically use either #2 or #3, with #3 being the most telegraphic.
    But then, what about an apostrophe for \"years\"? Some people say that the apostrophe
    isn't needed because the experience belongs to them and not the years, or that
    \"years experience\" is short for \"years of experience\" and not \"years' worth
    of experience.\" Others say the apostrophe should be used because it's the genitive
    case (see the Chicago Manual of Style 15, paragraph 7.26).\r\n\r\n(Later edit:
    just to be clear, I'm talking about whether it should be \"25 years experience\"
    or \"25 years' experience.)\r\n\r\nSince you don't know what the hiring manager's
    opinion will be, I think it's safer all around to use #1.\r\n \r\n\"City code\"
    doesn't need to hyphenated unless your client was inspecting the codes themselves.
    However, there are different kinds of city codes (administrative, business, building,
    traffic). I assume from the combination of \"property manager\" and \"city codes
    inspector\" that your client was a building inspector. If so, consider using that
    instead of city code inspector (\"With over 25 years of experience as a building
    inspector...\").\r\n\r\nIf you can state which codes she was inspecting to (ICC,
    BOCA, SBCCI, ICBO, NFPA, ADA, ANSI, NEMA, UFAS), that would be good."

    more. Didn't realize how involved this can be. Let me think about it some more.

  body: It's easy to get wrapped around the axle on this kind of stuff. Reasonable
    people often disagree, and it's not necessarily that there's a right way or a
    wrong way, just which way your audience expects to see it. Since that's hard to
    tell for a resume, I prefer to use the approach that's least likely to look like
    a typo or a grammatical error. In formal writing, I go with Chicago.

  body: "How about:\r\n\"enforcing city code compliance for over 25 years\"\r\n\r\nIt's
    a  little long, but more active and less ambiguous, no?\r\n\r\nor what about this:\r\n\"enforcing
    city code compliance since 1979\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell... This would only work
    were he still a city inspector. As a property manager he'd need something different.
    Still, it's something to think about."

  body: And given it's a business card, I'd be concerned about how much text is going
    to be on it.  Sure, you can put a lot on, if  you make it virtually unreadable,
    but that seems rather counter-productive, and why I would still like to see a
    mock-up.  ;-)

  body: 'Boy, did I had a senior moment: it''s not a resume, it''s a business card.
    So of course you can''t list all the codes, and you want a pithy sentence. I think
    I''ll just slink away now... but I still recommend using a construction that avoids
    the ^years^ vs. ^years''^ issue.'
