  body: Nice old printing is like candy to me. I really like this detailed picture.
    I wish I could help out with the actual typeface. Looks very Clarendon indeed,
    but slightly condensed. Since you know the date. I would recommend to try and
    go through type specimen from that period. I've searched through the ones I have
    at work, but I'll make a better try at  home as well.

  body: "The original Clarendon design was fairly narrow, compared to what we're familiar
    with these days. This is very much in the original Clarendon style. It is also
    reminiscent of a few turn-of-the-20th-century Linotype \"Antiques\" -- maybe Antique
    No. 2 or No. 3. But the Big Red specimen doesn't have any showings of these early
    Antiques.\r\n\r\nHowever, that 'g' is definitely unique and possibly an alternate.\r\n\r\nYou
    should look for a specimen from Tetterode or one of the other Dutch foundries
    from that period. The ij digraph pegs this as a language-specific font, so checking
    in the regional specimens would probably be most fruitful.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

    hit. Still it's quite interesting about the different \"g\" etc. I'll have to
    make a bit of more research when I get more time. Good luck anyway."

    is close to this (except for the g).

    you're not new here).\r\n\r\nThat \"g\" looks very German to me.\r\n\r\nKent,
    that \"j\" could simply be kerned. In fact that might be related to why the \"g\"
    is funny: the bicameral form tends to dig further right at the bottom. In fact
    the \"g\" is very loose on the right. On the other hand, the \"gj\" sequence <em>is</em>
    pretty rare... What does the lc \"q\" look like?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<cite> > Kent, that \u201Cj\u201D could simply be kerned. </cite>\r\n\r\nSure,
    it could be. But I doubt it, since there are no other kerns evident in this font.
    Also, if it were a kerned sort, instead of an ij digraph sort, I still think it
    would be a language-specific offering. Even in metal fonts that regularly incorporated
    any kind of kerns, I don't think j was a regular candidate.\r\n\r\n-- K."

    then. Odd, however, that lj is not as tight as ij, even though the l and i look
    to have basically the same rsb.\r\n\r\nNot more timid; just not bothered to be
    cast with a kern. For most languages, I don't think it would be important. But
    this is mere supposition on my part.\r\n\r\n-- K."

  body: "Actually, looking at the spacing difference, I suspect you're right. BTW
    Pascal (from Tetterode) had both a \"j\" (unkerned, actually) and an \"ij\", although
    in that case the latter's \"j\" had its curl projecting passively under the \"i\".\r\n\r\n>
    just not bothered to be cast with a kern.\r\n\r\nIndeed, kerns break often, causing
    expense. This being a sturdy font however might have been a good candidate. Plus
    if you had a non-kerned \"j\" (with such a strong terminal) the left sidebearing
    would be pretty large, making Dutch especially ragged. On the other hand, this
    is a rather loose (not to mention uneven*) font.\r\n\r\n* Which makes me thing
    it wasn't by Tetterode, since that foundry was pretty quality-conscious AFAIK.\r\n\r\nSo:
    I think this font had both a kerned \"j\", and an \"ij\". And I suspect it wasn't
    Dutch, but imported, and while they were at it making an \"ij\" they added a custom
    (and rather poor) \"g\" as well. Seeing the lc \"q\" might still be revealing
    I think.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
