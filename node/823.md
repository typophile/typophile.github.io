body: is there, to anybodies knowledge, a compilation of the origins and development
  of &#40;hip hop&#41; bombs, tags and writing? I would find that a fascinating read,
  as there are definately regional variations and there is definately an art to not
  only encoding the words, but also decoding the words. it is a script wholly unto
  itself, and i think it deserves typophile attention. due to the essentially ephemeral
  nature of this artform it would probably be wise to record and preserve some of
  these masterpieces.
