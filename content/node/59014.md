body: "I recently finished a font I have been working on for some time as I had to
  find a way of combining characters as ligatures. When I found VOLT I was excited.
  I finished the process of making ligatures and shipped the font. I then Installed
  it and tried it on Word 2007.\r\n\r\nThe Ligatures don't work. None what so ever.
  Is there a reason for this? Does Word not support the ligatures made with VOLT?\r\n\r\nThe
  font was created using Font Creator 5.6 if that makes a difference.\r\n\r\nIs there
  anything I can do, maybe a program or add-in I can download to resolve this issue?\r\n\r\nThank
  you."

  body: Word does not support Latin script ligatures because it does not call the
    function in the Uniscribe shaping engine that implements the OT ligature features.

    of a few discussions).

    OpenType typographic goodies. It does at least have kerning on by default, though,
    unlike Word.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: I should clarify that I was talking about what OpenOffice does for western
    languages. Like Word, it may very well enable all sorts of things where required
    for support of complex writing systems... I don't know.

  body: OpenOffice does provide pretty good complex script support, using either local
    system layout engines or ICU depending on platform. I've found a few editing hiccups,
    but the layout results are decent.
