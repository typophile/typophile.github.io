body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a typeface that has Gaelic influences or
  a sort of Gaelic \"feel,\" but is still pretty easily readable for a modern American
  audience.  It's to set the excerpts of a poem that opens the chapters of a story
  in a literary magazine/journal; the poem is actually excerpts from the Carmina Gadelica
  (a body of traditional songs and chants from the Western islands of Scotland), first
  in the original language (anglicized, though; the author doesn't want it actually
  to be in Gaelic), then translated.  I want the typeface to evoke the mood without
  being too extreme.  I think a face like Eirinn Gaelic just requires too much work
  to read, even just for the five or six lines of a poem; the letter forms are too
  unfamiliar, and I think readers will end up just skipping it.\r\n\r\nI'm going to
  use Warnock (10/12) for the body of the story.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Forkbeard</a> has traces of uncial which could be read as Gaelic.\r\n\r\nOr, you
    could search for <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=uncial\">Uncial</a>,
    perhaps one of these?"
