  express ltd&#39;. They specialise in bottled water, and coporate water coolers.
  It needed to be modern, clean and simple without being pretentious. Didn&#39;t want
  any imagery. So they got this:  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/70938.gif"

  body: Too much.  Three logos. Stick with the first face. It works. <BR>If you need
    speed for the &#39;express&#39; you could slant the same <BR>typeface &#40;maybe
    lighter&#41;.  I also find the the ligature &#39;TD&#39; <BR>off-key. And what
    does that period mean ?  Haere ra. <BR> <BR>AS

  body: Yeah, off key is right. The period was to signify the abbreviation, and I
    quite like this sort of punctuation, I find it lends authority. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t
    really stick with the first face, it is custom! So is the second. Ah well. I had
    a play with the ltd, smaller looks tacked-on, bigger looks clunky, and lower case
    looks too much. But I will have a fiddle. <BR> <BR>&#34;Haere ra&#34;

  body: Kris you have no priority in the importance of the words. All are pulling
    for emphasis. Shouldn&#39;t it be Mineral Express as the name and LTD as small
    as you can make it. The period is just wrong its not a sentence. Also the gradient
    is a gimic. Make it work in black and white first. Good start, keep going

  body: "Kris, I really, really like the letterforms in this logo, but I agree that
    the hierarchy seems too flat and noisy, but that may just be the size at which
    we're looking at it. A smaller size printed will probably calm down. I don't mind
    the gradient, since they're letterforms and will probably work fine in black.
    I'm really digging the 'mineral', specifically. The 'p' in express bugs me a bit.
    The vertical goes too high for my taste.\r\n\r\nAll-in-all, I think it's great,
    particularly for the turnaround time."
