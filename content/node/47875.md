  Will you me give some valuable critiques on which typographic version you prefer
  and what I could do to improve either? At this point, I'm only concerned about the
  actual letterforms, not any icons or anything else.\r\nI'm concerned that the top
  version of Canopa feels a little too techy with the \"n\" with no tail, and I thought
  the capital \"n\" felt too... default all caps.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture10_4239.png]"

  body: I don't get a "techy" feel from the top one. I like the simplicity of the
    letters and the spacing. It sits nicely with me. Even though it may be a bit boring,
    I like the top one better. To me the tail on the "n" just doesn't fit.

  body: I would round the top join (and possibly the bottom join?) of the "P," as
    it doesn't seem to fit with the rounded angles of the "A" and "N."

  body: "Good call on the \"P\". I like the top \"N\", feels modern but not overly
    techy. The bottom one doesn't work for me, just seems a bit awkward.\r\n\r\nWhat
    exactly is the identity for?\r\n"

    you have any other suggestions.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture11_3687.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    identity is for a local retailer.  I'd prefer to have this critiqued as though
    it was a font (albeit a limited quantity of letters) so I can improve letter drawing."

  body: "I do like the lower one. The tail adds a bit of flair.\r\nBut since it has
    no purpose, I would loose it too.\r\n\r\nBoth are not techy, this probaly due
    to the spacing between the letters.\r\nIt has a basic feel to me. \r\n\r\nRounding
    the corners is a good comment.\r\n\r\nLooks like kerning is slightly off between
    AN.\r\n\r\nNice type!"

  body: "Nice work and I enjoy seeing how this has developed and will progress.\r\nBut
    I am wondering why you are modulating the stroke width on the 'C' -\r\nor maybe
    it just my eyes playing tricks on me?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "No your eyes are not playing tricks, I guess. I see it too.\r\nBut it seems
    that the C is a result of the O in which the stroke width is adjusted.\r\n\r\nI
    see that this is not the case in the P where you would also expect the same treatment."

  body: There is a slight adjustment in widths. For example, the bowl of the P modulates
    a little (maybe it needs a little more), as does the with of the right leg of
    the A.
