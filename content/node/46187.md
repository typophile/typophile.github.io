  body: "Can you explain the technology behind your idea? I am not sure if text rendering
    in Firefox can be controlled by a plug-in. \r\nIt seems Mozilla is already working
    on the @font-face support: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70132\r\n\r\nAlso,
    why should there be central font server for open-licensed font? If the browser
    supports the embedding, the font files can be stored on ANY server. "
