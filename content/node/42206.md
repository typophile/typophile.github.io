  body: "It's an old font that was originally called 'Dragonwyck' (I think), which
    has been digitized as [[http://www.dafont.com/dragonwick.font?nb_ppp=50&text=Heart+India|Dragonwick]]
    by my old friend FontGrube. I think several digitizations exist, including one
    by Rick Mueller.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: One clarification about Dragonwick, Mike - it was digitized by David Rakowski.
    <a href="http://www.fontgrube.de/en/index.htm" target="_blank">Fontgrube</a> (Andreas
    Hofeld) took several fonts that others had made and improved them by fixing mistakes
    and filling out the character set. He was always very up front about this.

  body: "Thanks for the info Mike. Yes, I knew Andreas did that, but I didn't know
    the story about Dragonwick. Rakowski rarely used the original names for his digitizations,
    so I am still wondering what the first name was for this script.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "I forgot about the numbers, but yes, they are from some other font. I just
    scanned through the Script Guide 'calligraphic scripts' and 'antique handwriting'
    fonts, and couldn't spot these numbers. Numbers are hard to ID without letters
    to help pin down the style.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I missed the numerals too, Eric. Those would be done using <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/arabella-pro/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Arabella Light</a> (Arnold Drescher, 1930's).\r\n\r\nMike -
    Rick Mueller, of course, often used alternate names for his fonts as well. I've
    never learned the original name for Dragonwick/Dragonfly either. That's always
    been a tiny burr in my saddle."
