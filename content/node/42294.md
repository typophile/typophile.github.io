body: "Hey Everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm following <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html\">Adobe's
  glyph naming convention</a> and I'm comparing a few things to the way glyphs are
  named in Adobe's Arno Pro and I have a few questions that I hope someone can assist
  with. I've also followed along with the \"<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/20508\">Why
  not Cyrillic Glyph Names instead of afi00xx?</a>\" thread but I'm still left with
  a few really specific questions.\r\n\r\nI understand that glyphs that aren't in
  the AGLFN are best suited to have a name that reflects their Unicode value with
  the \"uni\" prefix for glyphs that are in the Basic Multilingual Plane, and the
  \"u\" prefix for those that are in the Unicode supplemental planes. \r\n\r\nHowever,
  it also looks like this is interchangeable, as if I can pretty much use either \"uni\"
  or \"u\" for any glyph name that has a Unicode value no matter which plane it's
  in, but only \"uni\" for Unicode values are only four digits. Is this correct? For
  instance, I see in Arno Pro that the Tcedilla is named \"uni0162\", but the Tcedilla_h
  ligature is named \"u0162_u0068\" instead of \"uni0162_uni0068\".\r\n\r\nWhen using
  \"uni\" and \"u\" names for glyphs with components is there any difference between
  using \"uni0162_uni0068\" or \"uni01620068\"? It makes sense to use an underscore
  as a convention for ligatures and not using underscores for glyphs that use components
  for accents like in the example \"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER EZH WITH CIRCUMFLEX AND GRAVE,
  which is not in Unicode, should be named 'uni01B703020300'\" but would there be
  any problem with \"uni01b7_uni0302_uni0300\"?\r\n\r\nAre there any disadvantages
  to using \"uni\" or \"u\" names with glyphs that already have a valid name in the
  AGLFN, like using \"uni0391\" instead of \"Alpha\"? I see that it's advisable to
  use Unicode names for Delta, Omega and mu, so I wonder if there would be any problem
  doing this for the rest of the Greek alphabet.\r\n\r\nAnd also, while I was picking
  around in Arno Pro looking for answers I saw:\r\n<code>sub uni0164 h by Tcaron_h;</code>\r\n...I
  figure it might be a bug that a glyph name would use \"Tcaron\" when the Tcaron
  in that font is named uni0164, but is it still possible to use more readable glyph
  names in some situations, like this Tcaron_h ligature?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance,
  I appreciate it!\r\nAndy\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Different parsers for glyphnames use different logic, and there is a chronology
    in those names. The AGLFN names are the oldest, so the largest number of applications
    will recognize them. The \"uniXXXX\" names are newer, and then the \"uXXXX\"/\"uXXXXX\"
    convention is newest. For non-BMP Unicodes \"uXXXXX\" is the only option but a
    BMP glyph named \"u0391\" might not be recognized in some older versions of Acrobat,
    for example. The other limitation is glyphname length, which should be less than
    32 characters. \r\n\r\nThe following is a list of glyphnames for the same glyph
    but given in order from \"oldest\" (which has the widest recognition) to \"youngest\":
    \r\n\r\n\"c_k\", \"uni0063_uni006B\", \"uni0063006B\", \"u0063_u006B\"\r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: i believe (and Miguel can correct me if I'm wrong), that some of the ambiguity
    between the unixxxx and the uxxxx names in Arno has to do with <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/36619#comment-223873">an
    OSX bug</a> that requires the truncation of glyph names in larger fonts so that
    the string INDEX does not result in system crashing.

  body: "Andy, you need to be careful in case you want to use Arno Pro's glyph names
    as a guidance. As Paul said, we had to compress *some* of the glyph names from
    uniXXXX to uXXXX in order to avoid a bug in OS X 10.4.8 and earlier. Here's more
    about it http://www.typophile.com/node/36619\r\nWe also used uniXXXX/uXXXX names
    in some cases where the usual standard name was longer (e.g. estimated --> uni212E)\r\n\r\nAt
    first we considered using uXXXX throughout, instead of uniXXXX, for glyphs outside
    the Latin-1 block. This would make the glyph names more consistent and have the
    fonts further away from the limit that triggers the bug, as that would shorten
    each glyph name by 2 characters. But later we found out that not all apps can
    parse uXXXX-style names, so we had to go back to using the uniXXXX format on some
    of the glyphs. The logic behind it is that, the default form of the glyph (i.e.
    the one that has a Unicode mapping in the 'cmap' table) received the 'uni' format,
    whereas its alternates received the 'u' format (e.g. Idotaccent --> uni0130, Idotaccent.swash
    --> u0130.b). \r\n\r\nThe glyph suffixes were also reduced to the bare minimum,
    again, to reduce the glyph name's length. That's why you'll find the suffix '.a'
    being used on small cap glyphs instead of the usual '.sc' (e.g. a.sc --> a.a).
    (BTW, applications are not supposed or expected to interpret the suffix, so it's
    safe to do this). We wrote a script that analyzed the frequency of all the suffixes
    used on the font's glyph names, and then based on that we replaced the original
    suffixes by something shorter. 'a' through 'z' was not enough so we needed this
    frequency analysis for deciding which suffixes would be replaced by two character
    alternatives (e.g. 'aa', 'ab', 'ac').\r\n\r\nSo, you should just keep using the
    usual and standard glyph names, unless you're working on a project with a large
    glyphset which is going to be generated into OT-CFF fonts, and you suspect that
    the fonts will be over the limit and therefore trigger the bug. But before you
    start compressing glyph names check -- manually or with the [[AFDKO]] tools --
    to see if you need to do so.\r\n\r\nNote: The uXXXX format is standard, but was
    devised some time after the uniXXXX format, so not all the apps have updated their
    ability to parse the shorter version. This might be also due to the fact that
    the 'u' format is used for specifying characters beyond the Basic Multilingual
    Plane, a.k.a. BMP, in which case the number of digits in a u-like name is bigger
    than 4.\r\n\r\n"
