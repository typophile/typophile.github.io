body: "Does anyone have recommendations for reading material or resources regarding
  vintage type , history, patterns, and most importantly tips and techniques. I'm
  not looking for inspiration, but process descriptions, font pairing tips, ect. Essentially,
  why do the vintage  (the late 1800s to early 1900s AND 'modern' vintage) labels,
  posters, logos work together. \r\n\r\nHere are some excellent examples from designers
  embodying the attached images. If anyone works specifically with elements like this
  feel free to add your opinions, comments, ect. It would be greatly appreciated!
  \r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n\r\n"
