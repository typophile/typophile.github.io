body: "Looking up 'Ieuan Rees' on the internet today I came across a Typophile thread
  of 26 Nov 2004  on David Jones' lettering and on the lettering on the front of the
  Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff. Further down the link Typohile members Dan Reynolds,
  'Porky' and John Hudson passed favorable comments on an inscription of mine in Welsh
  Slate at the Glynn Vivienne Gallery in Swansea, Wales.\r\nUnfortunately it was wrongly
  attributed to another Ieuan Rees from Newport who is a Graphic designer. I come
  65 miles further west from a place called Ammanford.\r\nBelow is rather a bad photo
  of that inscription together with a few more in a similar style, as well as one
  or two in different styles.\r\nAll the letters I carve are my own designs and I
  have designed 3 fonts which have been designed specifically for carving.\r\nA recent
  Typophile thread was on the Trajan Fonr so I have included a photo of a headstone
  showing  my version of the Trajan Roman Alphabet .\r\nIf some of you would like
  to see samples of my work in different catergories please have a look on the link
  below to my homepage.\r\n\r\nIeuan Rees\r\n\r\nhttp://homepage.mac.com/ieuanrees\r\n"

  body: Thank you. That's some gorgeous lettering. There really is something inspiring
    about carved letters, especially with the flowing calligraphic letterforms...
    You know that they were meticulously chiseled of course, but It feels like a special
    brush just cut through the stone in easy, graceful strokes.
