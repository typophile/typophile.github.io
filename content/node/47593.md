  in the college campus itself. The map is to work across a variety of mediums (Print,
  Web etc etc) and the Signage System is to work across a 4 disjointed campus. I'm
  looking for a font that's distinctive, readable when small, readable when large
  and of course, suited in style to a design college. Any ideas? Also looking for
  pics of an existing signage system (London underground, Charles de Gaulle Airport)
  smart enough to inspire.\r\n\r\nSome fonts that I've thought of : \r\nSatero Type
  system\r\nMeta Type System\r\nCentury Gothic\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nArjun\r\n"

  body: "Some of the bigger metros are actually somewhat dull (although well done)
    if in part because their use by larger numbers of people and sheer number of sations
    starts to impede originality.\r\n\r\nFor example, comparing the Madrid and the
    Lisbon metro, the Madrid one uses Helvetica almost religiously, has gray or blue
    backgrounds for everything except the line colors, and is obviously designed to
    be efficient and easy to understand but very much in the background.  The Lisbon
    one, with only four lines, has a much lighter feel to it, using more whites, curves,
    and a much more modern sans.\r\n\r\nAre the campuses separated by fields?  Or
    essentially distinct universities under one name?  I would think you could make
    some interesting design decisions based on that.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro

  body: "hi guifa,\r\n\r\nMy college has 4 campuses each one holding a different specialization...
    ie graphic design, film, experimental media etc... All of which are in different
    directions... Each campus also has a distinctive architecture different from all
    the rest (this wasn't intentional from what i can gather... it just happened that
    way) \r\n\r\nI have a couple of interesting ideas like using 'super graphics'
    painting lines of color along the walls of each campus. Each line originates from
    entrance where a visitor would be able to find an index Key that would give him
    the line he ought to follow.\r\n\r\nMy real dilemma now is the font. What should
    i use that would have enough flexibility for both print and web?!?\r\n\r\n--\r\narjun"
