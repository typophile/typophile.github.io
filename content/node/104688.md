body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have just finished building out a website, based on a wordpress
  theme. I am quite happy with it but when I have asked for comments from people,
  a number of people have said that I should change the font in the top menus as the
  current font doesn't stand out well enough against the bright backgrounds. I was
  hoping somebody here could give me some advice on what type of fonts would look
  good in this situation.\r\n\r\n[[http://newthaihotels.com|This is the site]]\r\n\r\nThank
  you"

  body: "Hi - \r\nYes the thin white font is not very legible, but it is still possible
    to read.  I do not know how much control you can have over the colors and font,
    but if you do you can try making the fonts <strong>BOLD</strong>.  The html tag
    may be 'strong'.  If that does not solve the problem, try to play with the colors:\r\nEITHER
    make the menus background a shade darker, OR  use a very dark red (instead of
    white) for the font.\r\n\r\nIn the black and white menus under the title \"Hot
    Hotel Openings\".\r\nAlso make the fonts <strong>BOLD</strong>, and try to use
    a larger font size.  Try using a light yellow for the font instead of white. \r\n\r\nGood
    luck"

  body: I can read the ones with the colored backgrounds okay; the ones with the gray
    backgrounds (further down the page) are a little harder for me. But if you're
    getting negative feedback you obviously need to consider that. You might try upper
    & lower case heads (rather than all caps) and then bump up the size a bit.

  body: "Thank you. I went with Monserrat and cabin as a fallback. I also increased
    the font size slightly and changed from all caps to lower case except for the
    first letter of each item. I also changed the long menu item name \"announcements\"
    to \"news\" to give the whole menu more breathing room.\r\nI think it looks a
    lot better. For the drop downs I maintained the uppercase and increased the size
    a bit.\r\nAlso, I changed the color and increased the font size of the city names
    on the grey tabs in the \"Latest hotel openings\" section in the middle of the
    page. I think it looks a lot easier to read.\r\nThank you for your suggestions.."
