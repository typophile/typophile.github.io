  body: "Thanks, Craig.\r\nI thought it could be a quick one I could just pop into
    every now and then between work on (provisionally titled) Freshscript. Given that
    it's mostly drawn already and spacing and kerning are already in place, it should
    just be a matter of chopping bits out.  WRONG!  Optical adjustments are needed
    all over the place, though strangely not where I'd expect.  The holes in the o,
    c and e I thought would mean I'd need to extend them to correct the overshoot,
    but by my eyes they look ok.  Almost as if my brain is filling in the holes in
    the stencil.  Or am I wrong?\r\nAgreed on tittles, r and c, but what do you mean
    by the midline in p m and n?\r\ns I was already planning on changing.  Putting
    the breaks in there made it look italic, or at least rotated slightly.  I'd shifted
    the bottom bowl a bit to the right to compensate but they still look bad, so I'll
    have to move the cutouts more optically centre."

    more towards making an interesting shape with the spine of /s/, like you have
    with the stem of /a/ or diagonal of /z/. "

    somewhat like the /c/.

  body: Hi, back on with this font now!  I don't see the curved thicks thinner than
    the straights.  It's definitely not uniform in colour and I'm working on that
    to an extent, but given the displey nature of the font I'm not going to spend
    hours squinting at it, especially since I think a certain amount of variation
    of colour adds character.  Wouldn't you agree?

  body: Well, I'd think you wouldn't want a font where certain letters stick out distractingly
    as too light or too heavy. To me, /j/ and /i/, for example, look too heavy on
    that last image. But print it out on a good printer, and it should only take minutes
    of squinting rather than hours, I'd think.

  body: Yes they do, but their stems are the same thickness as other verticals.  I
    think the problem was more down to the lack of space between the stem and tittle,
    which I've since remedied.  Strangely, I don't see it as a problem in the original
    Brag but opening up a lot more white space with the stencil 'cuts' seems to emphasise
    the closeness.

    area, so the uncut /i/ and /j/ are left heavier. \r\n<blockquote>Yes they do,
    but their stems are the same thickness as other verticals</blockquote>\r\nMathematically
    the same, optically not. And it's optically that counts!"

  body: "Oh, liking this Dave!\r\n\r\nI agree with eliason that the /i/ and /j/ are
    optically a bit too thick. \r\n\r\nWhile I love the /s/ and /c/ with the circles,
    it's the top of those three scrips's that I think will work best for actual use.
    that first /s/ could use a bit of extra whitespace in its stencil cut though?
    Same for the /y/'s - I would go with the leftmost one.\r\n\r\nOn second though
    that /s/ is tricky though isn't it? Not using dots makes it stand out, but using
    dots there can't be done in the same way. Maybe what Luma Vine suggested might
    work?\r\n\r\nIn any case, I find the test text very readable so far!"

  body: "It's 'finished' now and about to go live.  I've tidied it up a bit since
    the samples above, and have taken a bit of weight out of the verticals and made
    the tittles on i and j smaller to give the glyphs a bit more white space.  I think
    it works well now.  The s with circles is different to the above (stem goes closer
    to balls) and, as with the alternate y, they are stylistic alternates, not defaults.
    \ Anyway, it will be up within the next few hours so fingers crossed everything
    has come together and it's useful to people.\r\nCheers for all the critique, now
    on to the next one...."
