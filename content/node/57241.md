body: "greetings, fellow typophiles!\r\n\r\nToday I would like to get some feedback
  on the design of my resume.\r\n\r\nI was always a big fan of various designs created
  with helvetica, it seems to make certain design treatments look very good. I am
  however not a big fan of the typeface, and never use it myself. I particularly hate
  the lc 'a'. \r\nSo with this resume, I wanted to try and recreate a common helvetica
  layout without using helvetica. \r\n\r\nThe result uses Kris Sowersbys National.
  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hey, Victor,\r\n\r\nIn general, I like the bold look: the grid, the horizontal
    rows and rules, etc.\r\n\r\nThings I am not so keen about:\r\n\r\n1) I don't know
    what the custom is in Australia, but in the United States, at least, the word
    \"R\xE9sum\xE9\" does not usually go on a r\xE9sum\xE9. This is even recommended
    in books about job-hunting. (Now, if you are going to keep it in there, I think
    it's much too big, and using all caps makes it stand out even more. Also, there
    should be accents on both instances of <strong>e</strong>.) I think it would be
    better if you gave the large, bold italic treatment to your name and contact info
    instead, without making the type as big as \"RESUME.\"\r\n\r\n2) IMO, the city
    and date in the first column of \"EXPERIENCE\" should be vertically aligned to
    the top, like the two columns to the right.\r\n\r\n3) I don't like seeing the
    word breaks in the company names (AKOL Technologies, Avral Technologies). Maybe
    the type could be a bit smaller, or that column could be a bit wider.\r\n\r\n4)
    The column of text under \"PERSONAL TRAITS\" and \"INTERESTS\" is too wide to
    be read comfortably. And after the earlier, narrower columns on the first two
    pages, it's a bit of a jump: you get to page three and don't feel like reading
    anymore. You might want to split the width into two columns, and maybe even break
    up the \"PERSONAL TRAITS\" text into more than one paragraph. Or just shorten
    the text. Remember, it's a r\xE9sum\xE9, not a curriculum vitae -- you should
    try to keep things brief and pique the employer's interest, so that you get an
    interview.\r\n\r\n5) The white space beneath the rules should always be the same
    height."

  body: "I second Ricardo's suggestions. \r\n\r\nMy observations have more to do with
    content than design, I recommend changing your Personal Traits and Interests paragraphs
    and meld them into an \"objective\" paragraph that first would state the kind
    of job you are looking for. This can be loose and a little vague, something like:
    It is my goal to work at a fast-paced design firm that specializes in both print
    and web design. then segue into \"I embrace challenging projects that allow me
    to push myself creatively while meeting the needs of the client.\" and so on.\r\n\r\nProspective
    employers may not be hiring you for your writing skills but don't let your writing
    shoot you in the foot either. And so, I would also recommend that you re-write
    your job descriptions. Almost all them begin with either \"I have\" or \"I was\"
    introduce some variety.\r\n\r\nIt's probably a matter of personal preference,
    but I would only list the software and not the level of proficiency. They may
    say oh, he's not advanced at Java and not consider you when you truly have the
    skills required. The specific depth of your skills is probably best left for an
    interview.\r\n\r\nFinally, (and this may be a cultural thing since life seems
    to be very relaxed down under) but never tell a someone whom you are hoping will
    hire you that you enjoy hanging out with friends and having a couple of drinks.
    Even though almost everyone in the entire world enjoys that (including most bosses).
    It's unprofessional to put on a resume. \r\n\r\nBest of luck in your search.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Was reading else where on-line that many people consider an Objective paragraph
    superfluous. I see it as a means of introduction before getting down to the nitty
    gritty, so decide for yourself. However, the posters (most of whom were hiring
    managers or recruiters) were all in agreement that listing personal information
    (hobbies, interests and etc.) does not shine favorably on you.

    so in my r\xE9sum\xE9s I replace it with a short profile -- like you say, it's
    an introduction before getting into the details of work history and education."
