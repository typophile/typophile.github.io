    I was in school. As to the info about his life and work, thank heaven for <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/hatton/programme/2001/Evetts.html"

  body: "Evetts' book is interesting but it may give the mistaken impression that
    the Trajan letters were planned out geometrically. There isn't any evidence of
    this.\r\n\r\nYou should try to find a copy of Fr Edward M. Catich's <em>The Origin
    of the Serif,</em> which a good university library should have, and the rarer
    <em>Letters redrawn from The Trajan inscription in Rome.</em> The latter is likely
    to be kept in special collections, although there are six copies for sale on ABE,
    beginning at $138."
