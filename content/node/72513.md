    Why long s?\r\n3. Why the crossbar on Z?\r\n4. I wonder what \xD6 and \xC4 look
    like.\r\n"

    in 1927.\r\nI added a few more samples in the first post as well.\r\n\r\n/K"

    des 20. Jahrhunderts aus Deutschland</a> [20th century metal type from Germany].
    Dan Reynolds wrote an <a href=\"http://www.typeoff.de/?p=290\">English review</a>
    of this collection of scanned specimens, compiled by Hans Reichardt. Here is a
    <a href=\"http://www.spatium-magazin.de/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/bleisatz_d_inhalt_web.pdf\">table
    of content (PDF)</a> \u2013 you will at least find Ehmcke Fraktur and Ehmcke Schwabacher
    in it.\r\n\r\nReichardt also created <a href=\"http://www.klingspor-museum.de/Kuenstler.html#E-Anker\">a
    list of all typefaces by Ehmcke</a> for the Klingspor-Museum. Note that Ehmcke\u2019s
    full forename reads Fritz Helmut (without \u2018h\u2019).\r\n\r\nNick,\r\nwhy
    long s in Luftschiffhafen, or in general?\r\nFor the crossbar in \u2018Z\u2019:
    1. This is common in handwriting models/script typefaces \u2013 and blackletter,
    and can also be found in several of these German transitional (i.e. from Fraktur
    to Antiqua) typefaces. 2. It helps texturing the otherwise abundant whitespace."

    my name \u017Burawski :)\r\nSo, please, make Z without bar as alternative (for
    Polish lang) to not confuse Z and Zbar (for me they are different letters)."
