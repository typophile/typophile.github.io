  if you'd let me know what you think of it. I call it an experiment because of its
  rigorous construction principles: among other constraints, only vertical strokes
  are allowed to be thick, all angled strokes have one determined direction (N-E)
  and so on. I realize that such rigidity will never result in a highly legible typeface,
  but I was curious to see what comes out of it nevertheless.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/asdf_resize_3561.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hexa_kant-01_resize_5300.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/333757_2194808550640_1259990333_31868414_1567159181_o_resize_6039.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/328388_2194809510664_1259990333_31868416_1133932738_o_resize_5857.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think this is well beyond the stage of experiment. It looks like a very
    worthwhile exploration to me. It has not only merits as such but also high potential
    for an actual typeface. The legibility is perhaps better than one would suspect.\r\nThere
    are some witty ideas for details (s, k, \xDF), yet some tricky bits as well (accents,
    r_i, z).\r\nI hope you\u2019ll go on with it!"

  body: Thanks for your kind words, Andreas. I certainly agree with you regarding
    the problematic points, most of all the case of 'r_e'. In fact, because of the
    huge white spot the 'r' creates in running text, I ended up design a ligature
    for every 'r-' combination, which is admittedly far from an optimal solution :)

  body: "Actually I was going to say that the r-ligations are the best feature!\r\nAnd
    in parallel, I would increase the number of gaps, like in the S/s;\r\nthink \"texture\"!
    Frankly without such \"deviations\" this would be too\r\nmundane to be more than
    an educational exercise.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n- I would increase the ascenders - it
    would help readability.\r\n- This is crying out to be a bitmapfont too.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Thanks a lot for your suggestions, hrant. The reason for not introducing more
    gaps was in fact closely related to the abundance of ligatures. As in most cases
    the 'r' (and sometimes the 'f') combines with its neighbour creating such a gap,
    having the characters already 'gapped' would generate serious diffculties. These
    compromises are, by the way, what I meant by 'far from optimal'. I should add
    though, that creating <A HREF="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/30959735/340946_2130063092044_1259990333_31838426_992141830_o.jpg">ligatures</A>
    was a fun part.

    to include it as an alternate character.

  body: Great potential. The 3d-effect of the alternating strokes gives an almost
    tactile sensation. Brilliant 'g'! S-es also great. Are you sure about the placement
    of the tittles and the diacritics? I think the proximity to the bodies looks off,
    but that might be a question of taste.

  body: "Hi Sindre, you're absolutely right about diacritics. I've spent very little
    time with them and they certainly don't integrate well into the font. In moments
    of despair I even considered using regular, circle-shaped dots for tittles :)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tittles_5531.jpg]"

    height, and make them as tall as needed. '

  body: "Very nice work! I'm generally not a fan of such modernized blackletters but
    I think this one works very well in print\u2014especially with the vertically
    textured paper you used.\r\n\r\nAs for the 'r', I very much like the r_e ligature
    but with combinations like r_d I don't think it works well. I was actually about
    to suggest using a rotunda r inspired solution but Andreas mentioned that already."

    planning to continue working on the font in the future but I'm not sure when that
    will be, so I released a v1.0 today which can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://cargocollective.com/AkosPolgardi\">here</a>.
    Thanks again to all of you for your helpful comments and let me wish you a Happy
    New Year."
