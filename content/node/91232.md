    would you want to pair it with one?

    [[http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/bookmania.html|Bookmania]] has alternates
    of \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018g\u2019 that could match Heinemann\u2019s.\r\n\r\nBut
    we can't recommend much if we don't have some idea of the eventual use."

  body: Maybe a blockish serif like Serifa would fit? That would provide a nice contrast
    with the roundish Heinemann. (BTW I mean Frutigers font, not any other ones named
    the same.)
