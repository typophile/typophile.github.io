  body: "It's a beautiful font and I wish I knew what it was. That said, if no one
    is able to identify it and noting that it's obviously a rubber stamp, you might
    want to search through some of the most popular rubber stamp companies to see
    if you can find the stamp. The companies are usually very good about replying
    and letting you know if it's an actual font or just hand lettering turned into
    a font.\r\n\r\nBest of luck to you and post what it is if you are able to identify
    it outside this forum.\r\n\r\nPS Just a bit of searching, you might find something
    acceptable:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Typadelic/ or\r\nhttp://www.scrapnfonts.com/searchprod.php?search=&showingonly=&sortby=3&Submit=Search&viewoption=2&catid=21&subcatid=0&showonly=&sampsize=35&showrelated=&sku=&maker=&designer=&searchall=&days=&sale_price=&page=1&maxrecords=20&sampletext=order%252520of%252520service&page_bm=1&maxrecords_bm=20

    for you :)"
