  and I was wondering if anyone here has this. It seems like a good investment, as
  I have no font specimen books. Choosing a typeface would probably be a lot less
  daunting and more intuitive if I had a book like this. Thoughts?'

    me to a list?"

    library. The added bonus of being introduced to the newer foundries on the scene.

    and some others are not free! I'll just wait and put the complete set on my computer
    when I recieve the books/discs rather than try to hunt down all the free ones
    from the foundries listed above.

    that they have a sample of the face set at book sizes, say 10 on 14 point to a
    decent measure, so you can evaluate them at a working size before buying. I can't
    recommend a particular book although I have some 80's Monotype folders that have
