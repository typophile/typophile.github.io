  you charge, the more you are listened to.\r\n\r\nI remember a designer Bruce Hale
  telling a story about working for a non-profit for very little money, but getting
  very little respect or cooperation in return. But when working on a six digit project
  it's \"Yes sir, Mr. Hale. Would you like coffee with that Mr. Hale? How high again
  did you ask us to jump?\"\r\n\r\nI've seen this time and again, whether it be web
  design, a custom font project, book or brochure. Where, financially or otherwise,
  do you draw the line?\r\n"

    us the story of working on the Ford Identity project. He said the Ford PR guys
    first flew him up to Detroit to see the glitzy airbrush takes on a new logo they
    had done to show him their \"ideas\" for a logo. It was a big bash with spotlights
    and fanfares. Randy said, \"I told them to take me back to the airport and call
    me when they were serious about the identity project.\" \r\n\r\nPaul Rand could
    get away with that, you and I would have been dumped at the bus station.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    to do otherwise right now.\r\n\r\nBut I don\u2019t do ANY volunteer design anymore.
    I\u2019ve gotten burned too many times by people at nonprofits who jerk volunteers
    around every chance they get because it never costs them any money. The last straw
    was with a guy who would make appointments with me and not even be in the building
    when I arrived. The next time I want to volunteer I\u2019m just going to go clean
    up at an animal shelter\u2014at least the dogs appreciate the help."

    work the most are the least appreciative of free/low cost labor, when in reality
    they should be the _most_ appreciative.

    perfect sense.

    toxic places to work, let alone do business with. So yeah, no surprises there
    there, Dan. \r\n\r\nScrew the economy. Everyone wants to squeeze a little more
    blood and blame it on the economy. It's way too easy. Sure things are tough, but
    things cost what they cost, and a good design job is not a luxury. I think that
    (with the option of being more flexible in your back pocket), you lean as far
    in the direction of \"call me when you are serious\" as possible. I've been learning
    you don't get a lot of respect for being agreeable. Even less for being cheap
    and agreeable? \r\n\u2026\r\n-=\xAE=-\r\n\r\n"
