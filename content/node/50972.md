body: "I have been reading this site for just under a year, and I'm deeply impressed
  by what I have read and by the people who have written it. I am nothing like a professional,
  so I hesitate writing this; I hope you'll forgive me if I express myself poorly
  or use incorrectly what little terminology I know.\r\n\r\nI am in the process of
  trying to build a quality (professional?) typeface collection. This will likely
  be a life-long process, and I hope I have taken a couple steps in the right direction,
  but it's time to move forward a bit farther.\r\n\r\nMy first purchase was Brioso
  Pro (opticals) from Adobe when it first came out. I'll never forget the day I received
  the type magazine from Adobe in the mail: I devoured the article on the new typeface.
  Looking at the examples on the page, I saw through the Italian Renaissance all the
  way back to the Carolingian\u2014and on back to Rome and Greece. I had never been
  so impressed with a modern serif. I had to have it and purchased it immediately.
  I love this typeface; I feel fortunate to own (license) it.\r\n\r\nA while ago,
  I was trying to find a really good sans serif that I would love and want to use
  as much as Brioso. I posted on here asking for advice and received some great suggestions.
  I'm still looking, but I have narrowed down the field to a few choices: Helvetica
  Neue, Avenir, and Gotham. While I was looking at Gotham, I discovered H&FJ. And
  then I discovered Requiem and the Historical Allsorts collection. Requiem. What
  a beautiful and elegant typeface. I think of Brioso when I look at it, and have
  the same historical telescoping sensation. And the Allsorts collection, not surprisingly,
  has a similar impact upon me.\r\n\r\nThis past Friday and Saturday, I spent hours
  and hours researching Requiem (with the occasional sidetrack), a great deal of it
  here on this site (along with the H&FJ site) and I learned a few things which caught
  me by surprise.\r\n\r\nI hesitate mentioning the first thing that surprised me because
  it's clear that there's some\u2026disagreement\u2026on this site around this issue,
  but, there are no bold (or semi-bold) fonts for Requiem or Fell (Allsorts). I never
  even noticed that during all my visits to H&FJ to look at the typeface. I'm really
  rather embarrassed that I didn't notice the fact till I read a complaint about it
  here! Now, as soon as I read it, I thought back, and it's true as some have said
  there seldom seems a need for it, at least in some instances, but it seems to me
  there are other uses where it would be handy (I'm thinking of examples from the
  Lewis & Short Latin Lexicon and some other scholarly works). Bold fonts seem to
  give one more level of visual organization. Now, perhaps I could use Brioso for
  dictionary-type settings, and Requiem for other, more literary settings.\r\n\r\nIn
  reading this site, here are the issues which concern me\u2014and which no doubt
  show my lack of experience and training:\r\n1) Proper superiors (do they exist for
  this typeface?)\r\n2) Requiem's lack of bold or semi-bold fonts (and other typefaces
  from H&FJ)\r\n3) The lack of OpenType formats\r\n4) Style-linking (is this the right
  term\u2026using keyboard commands to go from Roman to italic?)\r\n5) The licensing,
  eg, saving my work as PDFs (at least the one from H&FJ)\r\n\r\nOK, I've clearly
  strayed from my original intent of asking about expanding my typeface collection.
  Here is my current plan, funds permitting:\r\n\r\nI have Brioso, and through my
  research on here learned that I also have Arno Pro (lovely! Thank you CS3). This
  weekend I had intended to buy Requiem and the Historical Allsorts (currently on
  hold while I try to learn more). Next, I'd love to buy Hoefler Titling and Text\u2014those
  patterns and fleurons are exquisite and I'd love to produce some Victorian-styled
  works. Then on to Adobe's Garamond Premier Pro (opticals). Somewhere in there I
  also need to pick up one or more of the above-mentioned sans serif faces.\r\n\r\nI
  also have a strong attraction to Didot and Bodoni (but not\u2026?\u2026Bauer?).\r\n\r\nOh,
  and if I might be permitted, could someone point me towards some quality reproductions
  of Medieval and Ancient scripts? I'm thinking particularly of various Gothic and
  Batarde scripts. I know there was a company that was doing some amazing digital
  reproductions of certain works (The Grammar of Ornament?). I thought the company's
  name started with an \"A\" but I can't find anything. Anyway, there are tons of
  knock-offs out there, but that's not what I want.\r\n\r\nI have some friends who
  are priests, and one reason for some of my choices would be a personal project to
  create sections of the Office (Breviary) as gifts. I also have something of a scholarly
  leaning, so Garamond's Greek (polytonic) is an added bonus. (I see there was a problem
  displaying polytonic Greek with Adobe's Garamond (or InDesign CS2) at one point.
  I wonder if that's been fixed?)\r\n\r\nWell, this is a much longer post than I had
  intended. Thank you for you patience, and I look forward to reading any replies!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nKeith\r\n\r\nPS
  I hope the \"problems\" I list for Requiem aren't taken as anything but personal
  problems, and likely due to my own ignorance and lack of proper training! I am deeply
  impressed with H&FJ, and the beauty and quality of their work. And may I just say
  the examples they use to illustrate each typeface's potential are inspiring! I wish
  I could get a specimen PDF containing these examples when I buy the typeface! (Perhaps
  they do offer such a thing.)\r\n"

    is to get in <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/about/contact.php\">contact with
    the foundry directly</a>, I guess.\r\n\r\nThe question of the appropriateness
    of having bold styles and the pitfalls of style-linking have both been brought
    up repeatedly by one dedicated member \u2013 and they have been discussed here:

  body: "Florian,\r\n\r\nFirst, my apologies for taking so long to respond. Work took
    over most of my week.\r\n\r\nRegarding Prillwitz, it's nice actually, but speaking
    only personally, it just doesn't have the same impact for me, though I'm at a
    loss to explain why.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Givry is lovely! Thank you so much
    for recommending it. I've added it to my (growing) list of typefaces to buy (thanks
    a lot! <g>).\r\n\r\nBefore I say anything more, let me again repeat that I am
    not a professional typographer. My opinions are formed only what (little) I have
    learned on my own, and my profound love for the written word.\r\n\r\nThank you
    sharing those two threads with me. I learned a lot from them, especially the second
    one regarding keyboard links. I was completely unaware of the issue until I started
    reading about it on this site. It certainly seems like an issue the industry should
    address, and perhaps it is. it can be exciting to come in on something like this
    and perhaps even contribute to the discussion. I was a Windows user, and just
    this past May bought a Mac Pro (I still love Vista and installed it via Fusion
    on my computer), but I am completely in love with my Mac. There are things Windows
    does differently, of course, and some things that, well, it does better. I wouldn't
    be surprised to find that handling type isn't one of them.\r\n\r\nI can see now
    that I will have to make some Global Styles to avoid this problem.\r\n\r\nAs for
    adding bold (or bold italic) to a typeface, I have to confess I'm probably still
    more for it than against it. Now, I don't design type, and therefore I don't know
    how hard it must be, though I can at least make a decent guess. When I think back
    on most of the works of fiction I've read, I can readily admit that bold was not
    used, or at least unnecessary. That realization alone was eye-opening. However,
    it is clear from reading a couple threads that spun off from \"Why doesn't Cycle's
    have bold\u2026\" that there was a desire, a legitimate desire for emphasis, and
    not only for commercial works but academic as well. Perhaps I'll have to purchase
    some Clarendons now as well.\r\n\r\nI certainly respect a designer's decision
    not to include bold and bold italic, but I hope some will consider it, or perhaps
    at least make suggestions for other typefaces they feel complement their own work
    and provide that extra level of emphasis which some designers may wish for or
    need.\r\n\r\nWhat an amazingly great resource this site is!\r\n\r\nMy thanks for
    your advice and suggestions,\r\n\r\nKeith\r\n\r\n\r\nFabricando fabri fimus."
