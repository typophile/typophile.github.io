  font. I used Fontographer 5 to make the changes. The font i generated works satisfactorily
  in InDesign ME but wouldn't work in MS Word.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nFor the time being,
  this is fine. But i'd like the font to work in both Adobe and MS Word. Now, i did
  some reading on this forum to know that i need to have OpenType Layout Table working
  with the font. Since the changes i made to the original glyphs are minimal, is there
  any way i can extract the table from the original font and compile it with the new
  one?\r\n\r\nIf i'm doing this wrong, could anyone point me to the right way to do
  this?"

    paid for their work. I've found that most of the useful publishers will allow
    it, if you ask permission. Not for redistribution, of course, unless it is work
    published under one of the open source licenses.\r\n\r\nI'm aware I've just called
    several publishers useless... YMMV."
