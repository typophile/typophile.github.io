  http://typophile.com/node/19363), but it doesn't really look like Palatino to me.
  For instance, the serifs in Palatino are flat vertical or horizontal lines, while
  the serifs in the AF1 font are at a 45 degree angle (except in the arms of the E
  and F) and look like arrowheads. Is it a custom US government version of Palatino,
  or is it some other font completely?\r\n\r\nThe attachment is a portion of the full

    (The declaration of independence is set in Caslon).

    is really close. But then Jason is right about the lower right of the N.

  body: Thanks for the suggestions, everyone. All are very close, and Americana would
    be so apposite. Unfortunately, none of the pictures I can find have a straight-on
    view, and given the effect of scaling up the letters to where they can be stenciled
    or handpainted on the fuselage, it's probably impossible to tell for sure from
    a photo.

  body: "An interesting pop culture side note: clothing designer Marc Ecko recently
    posted a video of himself <a href=\"http://www.stillfree.com/\">tagging Air Force
    One</a>. But the video was revealed to be an elaborate hoax. The first clue: the
    typeface on the fuselage isn't quite right! (Apparently Ecko rented a jet and
    painted it to resemble the Presidential plane.) There are other clues that are
    more obvious to airplane geeks. The video is done well and it's worth watching
    if you can appreciate a craven PR stunt.\r\n\r\nSkylar"

    that Jackie O picked out Caslon font for Air Force one because it was the font
    used on Declaration of Independence.

  body: "I tried the Serif Guide too and a bunch of Caslon versions came up among
    the 64 fonts that had these 'structural' forms, but the Caslon R's all have a
    slight arch to them where they connect to the counter (and many of them have a
    different C). It seems quite likely to me that this lettering was not made using
    a font, considering what it is being used on, so anything we suggest would just
    be a way to make something similar. I agree with Lex's pick, and also Oldstyle
    No.2, which may have been the typeface that Binney Old Style was based on.\r\n\r\n-

    according to Wikipedia) would've at least been a little more diligent in his leading
    to line-length ratio and perhaps his margins too.\r\n\r\nMaybe that was the fashion
    of the time, I wouldn't know. I just think it looks rather unofficial, not to
    mention, painful to read.\r\n"

    I had these fonts handy. They have all been widened (Binney to 125%, and the others
    \ to 150%) and had widened tracking applied.\r\n\r\nNone of the three is an exact
