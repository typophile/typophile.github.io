  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I was wondering whether I will be able to pick your brains and ask for a few helpful tips for designing my uppercase for my typeface I am designing at present.</p>
<p>This is the first typeface I have ever designed and I am still at the pencil drawing stage of the process, although well into now; lowercase drawn out and corrected and also lowercase diacritics are now complete.</p>
<p>I am now beginning to design my uppercase and some of the books I have and also the internet do not supply information on how my lowercase character proportions/widths transmit/relate to the design of my uppercase characters. I have the ‘Designing Type’ book by Karen Cheng, but this provides little in covering this other than sub-groups which the characters should be broken up into such as ‘rounded forms’ O, Q, C, G, S&hellip; and so on. Also she states that the uppercase counters should achieve even colour against one another.</p>
<p>I know what I am asking would probably account for a whole thesis, but a few help tips I would really, really appreciate. If it is of any help my typeface is a modern face and the uppercase I intend not to be using (unless someone advises me differently with a valid reason) classic proportions.</p>
<p>A huge thank you advance for any help offered and shared.</p>

<p>The essential here is to see how different widths and weights of your caps relate to your lower case&ndash;as well as one another&ndash;and that is going to be easier in a drawing program, as you can instantly try a cap with different lc words, and with other caps.</p>
<p>The second thing is to identify fonts you admire with similar characteristics to yours, as far as weight and width, and see how they have treated their caps.</p>
<p>Karen Cheng&rsquo;s book has useful stuff in it, though she doesn&rsquo;t approach design as a type designer would. (For that you can go to <a href="http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.1a/2.3.1.01.notes.htm">Briem&rsquo;s web site</a>.) You will learn a huge amount more by opening other great typefaces in Font Lab or Fontographer, and studying them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend to be an expert on this, but I&rsquo;ve been struggling with the same thing, so I thought I&rsquo;d share what I&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>I started by looking at other fonts, and seeing what others did. The good thing about the <em>Designing Type</em> is it tells how other typefaces are designed, and does a lot of the measurements for you. However, it doesn&rsquo;t tell you much about what to think about when you make your own choices, and how the cap/lowercase relationship influences, and can be influenced by, the logic of your design.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, the capitals of &ldquo;modern&rdquo; typefaces tend to be much heavier (with much thicker stems). This is a practice that I hate, as it creates spotty color, especially in texts with lots of uppercase. On the other hand, it is a <em>capital</em> and deserves to be a little more important, I suppose. In the types I&rsquo;ve designed (and admittedly I&rsquo;ve never designed a modern face), decided that even color is more important and kept my uppercase stems within ten units of my lowercase ones.</p>
<p>While the sub-groups are nice to think about and probably make things easier, I&rsquo;d let every letter you make influence the others. These groups can help you find places where you could copy and paste, but the proportions and relationships of your letters will undoubtedly extend across group lines. By drawing the entire alphabet a few times, you&rsquo;ll get the sub-group members (Q, C, G, and S) to work within the alphabet, but at the same time you&rsquo;ll improve the team captains (like O). Then you&rsquo;ll have to go back and work on the sub-group again.</p>
<p>Structurally, the capitals are an entirely separate alphabet (traditionally, at least). What helps unite the two alphabets are the non-structural aspects of the design: serif placement and shape, tension of curves, widths of stems, treatment of terminals, etc. These things might seem small and superficial compared with overall proportion, etc. but in my experience they are what really tie things together.</p>
<p>Creating two alphabets distinct enough to be differentiated but similar enough to work together on a line (or within a word) is a great challenge. I hope that others will come and fill in the gaps that I missed and question my approach. I have much to learn about this.</p>

William&rsquo;s suggestions are helpful and Briem&rsquo;s site is great. Also of use might be <a href="http://inicia.es/de/jmas/fontcreation1.html">this</a> from Typephases Design. By all means draw out the font if that is the way you want to work, but sooner rather than later you will get to a font rendering program such as FontLab Studio, Fontographer, or the very excellent TypeTool 2, related closely to FontLab.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Thank you very very much for your thoughts and vast knowledge and experience, really appreciated. William I am currently doing what you have suggested and analysing three typefaces I admire in relationship to my typeface and looking at proportions and widths etc. That is proving reassuring and enlightening and also very helpful in understanding how the lowercase and uppercase of a typeface work with one another. David and Jordy thanks for knowledge and links respectively. You both seem to be in a similar position that I am in, though maybe a bit more down the line in terms knowledge, if I come across anything that will advance what you told me I will post it on this thread.</p>
<p>Many thanks again.</p>
<p>Tom</p>
