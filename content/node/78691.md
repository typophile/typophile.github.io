  Illustrator or InDesign.  They come as .ttf for Windows and .suit for OS X.  Neither
  have displayed anything but rectangles in Adobe or word processors.  On both operating
  systems, the fonts seem properly installed but they don't work with the Japanese
  text I copy and paste in.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese fonts which appear to have been preloaded
  on my system work fine, so i know I can display Japanese but no other fonts i acquire
  work.\r\n\r\nHelp!"

  body: It most probably is a problem with encoding. The fonts on your system are
    Unicode, while the ones you downloaded could be Shift-JIS (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language_and_computers#Character_encodings)

    anyone recommend a way to convert these Japanese fonts to unicode?"

    that involves the least amount of stress and hair-pulling is to simply check whether
    newer versions of the fonts exist.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind, please post the names
    of the fonts that you have been unsuccessful in using."

    would be far easier to convert the encoding of the text."

    what does the fact that they seem to be 8-bit mean practically? I would like to

    language fonts."

  body: "Many of the free hiragana or katakana-only fonts found on the internet, including
    i2f's, appear to be encoded for entry with any of various western Latin (8-bit)
    keyboard layouts. The kana are mapped to the characters A-Z, etc. and not the
    proper Unicode points for their own script. This is inconvenient, but since most
    of these are clearly display fonts not intended for extended text use, it's an
    issue that can be dealt with. Some of these font developers supply a keyboard
    chart, but if you can't find one you'll have to experiment a while to determine
    which key corresponds to which character and draw out your own chart.\r\n\r\nIf
    you really must use these fonts with properly encoded Japanese text or with one
    of the Japanese keyboard entry modes, you'll have to open the fonts in FontForge
    (only because that's what I have; other font editors may work too) and copy the
    glyphs to their correct unicode positions and generate new properly encoded fonts.
    You should, of course get permission of the original designer and/or foundry for
    permission before you do so, but that may not be possible."

  body: 'To the OP: Given that you stated that you''re specifically looking for Japanese
    fonts that work with Adobe applications, have you poked around on the product
    DVD (or DVDs) that you received? I believe that we bundle many fonts with most
    of our applications, including Japanese ones. Look for a font folder, and inside
    look for files that include the strings "KozMin," "KozGo," or "Ryo." If you find
    such files, these are OpenType Japanese fonts that will work with Adobe (and other)
    applications.'

  body: "@cuttlefish - Other editors do work, indeed. I used Type 2.2 light on the
    Windows box to check this.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the fonts were built to emulate
    the encoding on some old eight-bit home computer(s). Mind, I'm sure I saw a Sharp
    MZ-700 on one image, whether that's relevant or not."

    I have been playing around with the included Adobe fonts, they're just a little
