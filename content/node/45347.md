  body: "Thanks for the announcement, David. I'll add these courses to Typographica's
    event list as well. \r\n\r\nSorry for the nitpick, but as long as this is an educational
    institution we might as well ensure accuracy: shouldn't the \"Hand-Drawn Type\"
    course be called \"Hand-Drawn [[Lettering]]\"?"

  body: "There is such a thing as hand-drawn type, no? Hand produced glyphs that have
    been corralled into a font? \r\n\r\nTo my way of thinking:\r\n<strong>Lettering</strong>
    is a subset of letters drawn for one application.\r\n<strong>Type</strong> is
    a set of letters drawn for use in multiple applications.\r\n\r\nAs a hand-drawn
    typer, this is a nitpick nitpick. Doesn't James teach some of these? Maybe he
    could speak to the content. But really... who cares. If you can, take the class
    :-)"
