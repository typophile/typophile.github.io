body: I'm wondering if anyone can point me to a good gallery of sign fonts? I like
  fonts from <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=fontsbystyle&s=13">House
  Industries</a>, and I just stumbled across <a href="http://artandsignstudio.com/californiaplug.html">SignFonts.com</a>
  from Art&Sign Studio recently. There are also classics like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_Casual">Dom
  Casual</a>. I'm just thinking someone must have cataloged a lot of these. Unfortunately,
  foundries like House Industries and Art&Sign aren't in the collections of MyFonts
  and the like.

  body: Because it makes it harder to discover those fonts. I suppose foundries want
    more control over distribution than sites like MyFonts and FontShop provide, or
    they don't want to share the revenue (though it would seem that a MyFonts would
    generate more revenue than it would pocket), but I wish then that there were a
    site that would archive all fonts possible, not for sale, but for research (and
    ratings and reviews). That would seem like a good project for Typophile, actually.

    but I get your drift.\r\n\r\nIdentifont.com does a decent job of archiving, but
    it does lack stuff from Signfonts.com and Sign DNA.\r\n\r\nYou might also search
    for fonts by designers who have a sign painting background. Here are two: [[John
    Downer]] and [[Jim Parkinson]]."

  body: It's fun just to scroll through all the familiar logos on <a href="http://typedesign.com/logos/ring.html">Parkinson's
    site</a>. Now I can tell so many people at WTF, "No, it's not a font, it's this
    guy's work."
