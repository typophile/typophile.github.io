body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nWe're a daily university paper working on a redesign this summer
  and struggling with fonts. We have a history of neglecting and harassing our readers
  with shoddy fonts, so we're looking for any help we can get. Everything is open
  for us \u2014\u2014 body, headline,  nameplate. \r\n\r\nFirst, some specs:\r\nWe
  run five days a week and our audience is primarily 18-22 year old students. We take
  our news seriously, but we happily print columns about sex and drugs, and we run
  words like \"cunt\" in the opinion section.\r\n\r\nWe're on a 11'x17' tabloid (59p
  x 95) on newsprint and we're irregularly in color (cnyk). We print 11,000 a day.
  We are six columns wide, and run with body font size @ 10.5. Headlines run at 42,
  36 and 30. Subheads are at 18. \r\n\r\nFinally, we're low on money.\r\n\r\nGod knows
  why, but for the past few years we've been using Bodoni Book for body text. Right
  now, we're looking at Trump Medieval.\r\n\r\nFor headlines, we'd like one serif
  and one sans serif. Right now we like Miller Headline, but we're not made of money
  and any cheaper suggestions would be wonderful. (I believe Rotation is on the shortlist.)
  Sans serif is up in the air. \r\n\r\nOur hunt for a perfect nameplate font is beginning
  to feel quixotic: we'd like to find one that is modern and forward thinking but
  vaguely elegant/classic \u2014\u2014 all the while keeping in mind that we're a
  bunch of idiot 22 year old students. (I suppose a nameplate is a very personal thing,
  but I just thought I'd ask.)\r\n\r\nSorry that ran so long, we really appreciate
  the help.\r\n\r\nDavid & Sabrina\r\n"

  body: "Given the volume of work your doing, you should probably try not to think
    too much about price in your choice: fonts would be a fairly insignificant cost
    compared to all the printing costs!\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, lots of possibilities:
    the Miller family is tried and true for body and headlines. Font Bureau has a
    number of other fonts you should consider, and has lots of expertise. You should
    probably contact them.\r\n\r\nHave a look Adobe's Utopia, and, a more \"outside\"
    choice, Adobe's Chaparral. If you own Adobe software, you may already have some
    of these. (Also, Adobe offers some of their fonts in special collections for education,
    see more info <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/03/ffee.html#more\">here.)</a>\r\n\r\nA
    very nice face you may not have consider is OurType's Arnhem. Arnhem Fine is \"modern
    and forward thinking but vaguely elegant/classic.\" Go to http://www.ourtype.be/home.htm,
    wait for the Flash to load, and navigate from there.\r\n\r\nAlso look at Kris
    Sowersby's <a href=\"http://vllg.com/KLIM/Newzald/Example+About/\">Newzald</a>
    at Village.\r\n\r\nAnd  <a href=\"http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=88\">Eudald
    News.</a>\r\n\r\nFinally, be sure to read the EULAs for any fonts you're considering:
    many foundries allow 5 seats at one location as part of their standard license,
    for others it's one. Some allow embedding in PDFs (which may or may not be important
    to you), others do not, or charge extra."

    even, dare I say, cool. It seems worth the purchase.\r\n\r\nSorry to trouble you
    further, but do you have any suggestions for a sans seriff (for headlines)? We
    could settle on ITC Franklin Gothic, but it would be just that \u2014 settling.
    \r\n\r\nDave"

  body: Our local paper just switched up their layout and overall typography, and
    the heads are now set in Interstate. Now Interstate does not sit well with my
    eyes, but it definitely has some distinction and I daresay a bit of an edge or
    bite to it. I read our campus newspaper every day, and a "bite" is certainly what
    it calls for! Also, Interstate has plenty of weights to work with. Personally,
    I enjoy it in its condensed form in all caps.

  body: "First of all, I wouldn't be too quick to dismiss Franklin Gothic: it's a
    very broad family, you've probably got several weights already, and <a href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/NewFonts/2008/Franklin.htm\">the
    latest ITC release</a> means you could get just about anything you need. There's
    also bargains to be had in it, for example, <a ref=\"http://www.myfonts.com/products/urw/franklin-gothic-cd/\">this
    URW collection.</a>\r\n\r\nI admit that you're going to be seeing yourself coming
    and going if you use Franklin. More out of the way , and very nice, is Nick Shinn's
    <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/brown.html\">Brown Gothic.</a>\r\n\r\nFontFont,
    at Font Shop, is crawling with excellent sans: <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=unit&x=0&y=0\">FF
    Unit</a>, the wildly extensive <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=fago&x=0&y=0\">FF
    Fago family,</a> the apparently infinite range of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=clan&x=0&y=0\">FF
    Clan,</a> or the distinctive <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=quadraat+sans&x=0&y=0\">Quadraat
    Sans,</a> with its headline and condensed cuts."

    site [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/index.html|Exljbris]]. I am a big fan of
    [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/museo.html|Museo]], which amazingly you can
    download all but 2 of its weights for free. This is probably the best free typeface
    you are ever likely to see.\r\nHowever I have yet to see it actually being used
    by anyone. Think your paper could be the one to break the mold? I think it would
    work really well as a headline and subheading face. What do you think?!"

  body: As long as we're talking about free/low cost alternatives, how about Lido
    STF. It's free for "non-commercial" use (which a student newspaper may or may
    not qualify as) and even if you DO end up being considered as commercial, the
    commercial license is relatively cheap (roughly $125) as fonts go.

    it's a high school publication, we couldn't get new fonts so we had to make do
    with what we had. The headlines and captions are Myriad Pro and the body is just
    plain old Times New Roman. The teaser/index on the left is Arial and the big headlines
    fonts are a combination of TNR, Gotham and Rockwell, in that order."
