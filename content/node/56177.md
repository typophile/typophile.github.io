  today and was blown away by the kind of dialogue on the forum, it's very exciting.\r\n\r\nI've
  got a more general question about ligatures, not just about legibility, but more
  about their context.  Wikipedia says (I know, I know) that ligatures are \"slowly
  coming back\" because of things like OpenType fonts.  This made me wonder about
  the use of ligatures in typography today.  I'm still relatively inexperienced in
  the field, but have the impression that ligatures are somewhat antiquated, especially
  to people who might only see Times New Roman, Arial, etc in their everyday interactions
  with type.  I'm sure they would be surprised by them.\r\n\r\nThis might be more
  a matter of opinion, but are ligatures (like ct, for example) more functional, or
  a way to express typographic tradition?  I recently used Abobe Myriad Pro for the
  draft of a long document, and had turned on ligatures in InDesign.  I was partly
  taken aback by the flavor it added to the text, but it also felt \"older\" (part
  of that is probably in part due to using Caslon...).  I'm curious to see what my
  advisor's comments will be.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find anywhere that seemed to tackle
  this question specifically, but feel free to direct me if there are other places
  to learn, etc.  Otherwise, I'm looking forward to hearing thoughts.\r\n\r\nCharlie"

  body: "Certain ligatures are certainly functional, others are more of an aesthetic/historical
    thing. In many fonts, the traditional Latin ligatures are functional. Looking
    at an old MS Word document set in Times, you'll see thye f clashing with the i
    and it's not very pretty. That said, there are many fonts where the f is designed
    in a way that it doesn't extend far enough to collide into the i, l, j or what
    have you. Often these fonts include ligatures anyway, which sometimes are inoffensive
    and other times look plain silly. Look at the Latin ligatures in Gill Sans or
    Futura for example...they end up drawing attention to themselves, which is exactly
    what an f-ligature is designed to avoid.\r\n\r\nLigatures in display faces can
    serve many aesthetic purposes. Matthew Carter's Mantinia is a good example. It
    takes a lot of inspiration from inscriptional carvings which sometimes used ligatures
    as a space-saving device. \r\n\r\nA more recent use of ligatures can be found
    in handwriting and script fonts. Zapfino and Bickham Script make heavy use of
    ligatures and contextual alternates to combat the uniformity of type, giving the
    impression of hand-drawn calligraphy. Many handwriting fonts similarly will use
    ligatures to imitate the pen strokes of the source material.\r\n\r\nThis is all,
    of course, relating to Latin typefaces. when you get into non-Latin scripts, ligatures
    are often an integral part of the writing system.\r\n \r\n\u2014Noam"

  body: "Noam, well said.\r\n\r\nIt's hard for me to imagine that the antique-looking
    \"tied\" ligatures like 'ct' ever looked normal to readers, but I assume they
    did, since they were so widely used once.\r\n\r\nLigatures that solve optical
    problems certainly are not (should not be) going out of style, and I do think
    that OpenType layout has enabled type designers to think beyond the standard f-ligatures
    and consider other optical problems which can be solved with ligatures. The notorious
    'Th' ligature in Adobe Originals is one such example. Not everyone likes these
    new ligatures, but ultimately it's up to the designer to decide how their typeface
    will serve the reader.\r\n\r\nIt's true that the standard f-ligatures get shoehorned
    into a font because of their presence in standard encodings. We (Adobe) eventually
    realized that some OpenType fonts in our library (particularly monospaced fonts)
    should have these ligatures off by default, because some look truly bad when they
    appear."
