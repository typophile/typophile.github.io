  body: I am working on a reprint of this book and need to spec a typeface for revised
    pages. What would be the best subsitute if this typeface is not avaliable at in
    an electronic version?

    you call one of those faces up on MyFonts and then ask to see \"More Fonts Like
    This\", you'll get a huge list of partial matches.\r\n\r\n/c"

  body: "Are you looking for a close match, or a <em>good</em> font that evokes the
    original? If the latter, then I suggest Minion, Spectrum, Dolly, Relato, Stone
    Print. I'd put in a special plug for Dolly - its treatment of stroke contrast
    is going to match the dark letterpress impression of the sample you posted, and
    should look fabulous.\r\n"

  body: I'd guess it as a Linotype typeface by the fact that there are no kerns. That
    should narrow your search down a little. ;^)
