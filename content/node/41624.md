    copy of Without Feathers that I have has the title set in the same face."

    (set in Benguiat - UGH). But both white type on black background.\r\n\r\nEven
    though the Woodman's recent movies have been uneven (I'm being kind) there is
    always something comforting about the tinkly jazz and the Windsor, it lets me
    know where I am."

    he might still have a regular gig somewhere.\r\n\r\nYep - just checked. He's at
    the Carlyle mondays through at least June."

  body: I made it down to Michael's a few times but only caught him once -- he wasn't
    all that bad, but that was 25 years ago....  ;-)  Too bad I won't be in town on
    a Monday.

  body: "When my friend Jimmy Harris was alive - at one point of his life he was the
    art director of trade books for Ballantine Books. He designed those Woody Allen
    covers. It was in Woody Allen's contract that the covers would be designed white
    Windsor type on a solid  black background and never his photo as the author.\r\n\r\nHere
    is one funny story he shared with me, that I'd like to share with you now. Jimmy
    wanted an author's photo on the back of one of Allen's books. He asked the author
    if he wouldn't mind coming in and placing his face on the xerox machine -- he
    felt it would be in style with the front of the book. Anyway Woody Allen declined,
    we are sorry to say. I think smashed Allen would have been a great photo!"
