  development of which was greatly assisted by its [[http://www.typophile.com/node/60316|Typophile
  critique thread]]), I have created Ambicase Fatface. It is considerably bolder version
  of that single-case font which strove to combine upper- and lowercase forms for
  each letter.  \r\n\r\nCharacter set and OpenType features are much the same as Ambicase
  Modern, though I have added discretionary ligatures for FT, CT, and ST. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AmbicaseFatface01_5059.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nPDF

    'options' seem have a dent in it where you made space for the swash. perhaps make
    the swash a little smaller? The ()/ look a little bit as though there from a different
    typeface to me. Why not give them a little contrast?\r\n\r\nYou're a much better
    typedesigner than I am, so take it with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nCheers, Jasper"

  body: "Thanks Jasper. You zoomed right in on an area that really is unresolved -
    the overlap on those swash /O/s - so thanks for prodding me to think more about
    it. Here are a few options for different approaches (each line has different treatment
    of the /O/ top; ROBOT is as before).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Os_6181.png]\r\nOf
    these I think COCOA works best.\r\n\r\nThose monoline, thin parentheses etc. were
    a design decision with Ambicase Modern that I've kept here. Perhaps oddly, I kind
    of like the mismatch. Maybe it reminds me of old-school typesetting where those
    types of characters were furnished by generic sorts rather than designed and cast
    for each different font design. If there's a clamor for some with more weight
    and contrast, I suppose I'd consider furnishing some, at least as an alternate."

    awe applies to that as well). The ffi ligature and section mark especially are
    elegant details. (And kudos for including the Rupee mark).\r\n\r\n<em>Those monoline,
    thin parentheses etc. were a design decision with Ambicase Modern that I've kept
    here. Perhaps oddly, I kind of like the mismatch.</em> | I was going to suggest
    that you do include the alternates, but after seeing them in context in the pdf,
    I'm sold 100%.\r\n\r\n<em>I think there\u2019s no escape for ij resembling \xFF.
    By the way, I like the RIJN version.</em> | I agree that that version is the best
    of the four, but what could you do if you gave both i and j a ball, facing each
    other? Is there some way they could interact that felt like a ligature without
    joining them? Or what if you had /i/'s swash connect with the ball on /j/ rather
    than its stem? I'm just spitballing here...\r\n\r\n<em>Considering a spurlike
    structure for the lower left of all the /B/s.</em> | It seems to me to be more
    gothic that way (how the serifs all point down, you know?) Then again, I guess
    it's only in that \"Beelzebub\" sample that that feeling becomes dominant. In
    the poster test it looks natural.\r\n\r\n<em>One of my recent changes was to cut
    that second thickening on T.fina's hook. That brings the center of gravity of
    the letter leftward. Does that fix the issue you are seeing? Or shall I still
    try bringing top out and/or bottom in?</em> | That does help a lot, but it still
    seems like the top should come out a bit too. I have a small problem with the
    other /t/s, too. The curve on the bottom starts a bit too low and in small sizes
    makes the transition look a bit angular.\r\n\r\nI have some beef with a few other
    glyphs as well...\r\n\r\nThe Copyright, Registered Trademark and @ don't quite
    work, IMO. It looks like the circles around the first two have an uneven stroke,
    and are not geometric. To my eye, an even, circular line would look better. For
    the /@/, I would rather see Ambicase's take on the more common, single-story a
    inside. I think the problem might be that without the apex, it doesn't read as
    unicase, so it's just a two story /a/ with a sloped straight edge on the side,
    which seems like a completely different font.\r\n\r\nThe initial swash versions
    of /M/ and /N/ have a strange negative space on the left side. I'm not sure what
    should be changed (if anything) because the swash makes sense, it's just its proximity
    to the straight edge of the, uh, what is that slanted line called in /M/ & /N/?\r\n\r\nThe
    alt /N/ (stylistic set 5, I guess) is a bit jarring for me (those points are so
    violent). It is nice to have a lowercase-style /N/, but I'm not sure it quite
    fits. I'd like to see more examples of it in context. I'd also like to see a swash
    coming from that up-turned serif on the inside, but going to the left (and possibly
    not with that scary xacto blade coming down)\r\n\r\nLastly, I have to say I'm
    not sold on the standard, upside-down-question-mark /Q/. I think it's the line
    inside that is the main problem. It's just weird that it's the a thin, vertical
    line that ends without a ball or curve or anything. I guess the closest thing
    to it would be the terminal of the /T/, but I don't think they really come across
    as fraternal. The more I look at it, I'm not sure if that's the only problem with
    it, but it's probably the same in the Modern version, so...\r\n\r\nThat's all
    I saw on my first glance through. Let me reiterate that this is an utterly fantastic
    typeface. I hope my comments help."

    out a bit more, though I'm struggling with keeping the weight on the strokes but
    not letting the glyph get too wide. (I think this would be a much easier glyph
    to do in the non-fatface versions of Ambicase.)"

    not generic and it still complements font face even though not perfectly it's
    much better than any other version. The last (sketched) looks like an /x/ unfortunately
    and shouldn't be considered at all.\r\n\r\nJust keep the vortex version. Doesn't
    look distracting and it easily reads as an @ sign which is important. And you
    have to be aware that this particular glyph will be rarely used with this typeface.
    I tend to think that way."

    has much more whitespace than the bottom counter now.\r\n\r\nMaybe the serif on

    that is part of the lowercase flavor. But I agree that if the counters are too
    out of balance it won't work. Another difficulty is that I can move the leg out
    to open up the lower counter, but then for proper fit with following letters,
    the arm should come out too, which of course opens up the upper counter I was
    trying to balance... Anyway, maybe this latest compromise works okay.\r\nThanks
    for the observation on the R - I agree and have changed it.\r\nSome tweaks to
    the humps of M, and to the swash forms of Q. Getting an agreeable weight is really
    hard on that Q, since it has three thick vertical strokes in the lower half, and
    only one (+ a teardrop) in its upper half. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_5149.png]"
