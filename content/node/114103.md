  new go-to print shop (Watermark Graphics) were so kind to give me the ampersand
  character from an old drawer of their wood type.\r\n\r\nThanks to Don over in our
  type ID forum he confirmed my guess that this face is Futura Bold ... http://typophile.com/node/114087
  ...coolio! It is the very first type I have ever been fortunate enough to hold in
  my hands ... and own, even if it is just one character lol.\r\n\r\nI have a few
  questions...  Is there a way to tell the date when these characters were cut? And
  how were they so precisely routered? And what type of wood was generally used? And,
  which foundry produced this particular set? Are there foundry marking stamped on
  a particular character's base?\r\n\r\nMuch thanks in advance!"

  body: Hi tmac, no luck on finding a foundry stamp on any of the uppercase A, but
    there were only three of them to check. Perhaps that particular uppercase A has
    gone missing long ago. When I get the time I'll go back and check the rest of
    the type.

  body: The font is being broken up, with the individual sorts being given away. That
    is sad. There may not have been humor intended; "breaking this font out of sorts"
    may simply be standard hot metal terminology.

    sold as individual decorator items.\r\nFor comparison, consider that some people
    buy old typewriters, cut off the keys, make them into knick-knacks and peddle
    the results. The practice is called \"key chopping.\" \r\nDon"
