body: Hi everyone I would like to identify this 3 fonts . First one in blue reverse
  the header REPUBLIQUE FRANCAISE. 2. The blue ones i.e carte nationale d'identite
  3. the black one like INES, MARSEILLER. That looked like a font I used to see called
  Amerie or America something.

    a look at that single-storey \u2018g\u2019.\r\n\r\nDiamian, your sample is pretty
    small \u2013\_almost too small for a good type ID."

  body: "Two things: 1) Since it is for an official purpose, I would expect it to
    be a bit like currency -- they would not use a standard font; 2) In the past,
    we have not agreed to help with questions that could help forge official documents,
    or currency.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
