  being implimented in moving image?\r\n\r\nobviously Robert Brownjohn and Saul Bass
  spring to mind along with the opening sequence to seven. but i wondered if anyone
  had anything they could share as i am currently researching techniques and methods
  that use type and moving image togther in an interesting and exciting way.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\nleonidas"

    one we were talking about. And I loved the Wimbeldon one. It's too bad their site
    doesn't have seperate examples of each project. \r\n\r\nEliason, maybe your grad
    student could post up some more work about him once he gets it figured out. "

    the loveliest thing I've seen lately in this respect is <a/href=\"http://strangeattractors.com/LYWH.html\">
    little yellow writing hood. </a> Maybe not 'good' typography, but it is an award
    winner, and I find the soundtrack irresistible.\r\n\r\nYou can find the link to
    it from <a/href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fiffteen/lywh.php\">FontShop.</a>"
