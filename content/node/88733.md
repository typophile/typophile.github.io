  a way for Molizza to apply kerning to bitmap font?\r\nWhat kind of bitmap font file
  would preserve kerning info that Molizza\r\ncan be used? It looks like bdf and pcf
  can't have kerning info with it."

    I put the following in the fonts.conf file\r\n        &lt;match target=\"font\"&gt;\r\n
    \               &lt;edit name=\"antialias\" mode=\"assign\"&gt;&lt;bool&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;&lt;/edit&gt;\r\n
    \       &lt;/match&gt;\r\n But it didn't help.\r\n\r\n\"BTW, how are you embedding
    the bitmaps?\"\r\nI used fontforge to generate the embedded bitmap ttf file and
    followed the instructon:\r\nhttp://fontforge.sourceforge.net/editexample8.html\r\n\r\nAlso
    I find out that some system setting in fonts.conf can turn embedded bitmap off.
    So I especitally turned it on by setting the following in my local fonts.conf.
    But it seems still not working...\r\n\r\n        &lt;match target=\"font\" &gt;\r\n
    \               &lt;edit name=\"embeddedbitmap\" mode=\"assign\" &gt;\r\n                        &lt;bool&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;\r\n
    \               &lt;/edit&gt;\r\n        &lt;/match&gt;\r\n\r\nFirst I need to
    let the browser display the embedded bitmap font, kerning is the second priority
    here.  But so far I'm not able to reach my first goal yet.  BTW, I'm testing with
    Firefox 3.6 in RedHat 5.5.\r\n"

    inclusive and dumbest-common-denominator.\r\nGray, fuzzy text is crap, period.\r\n\r\nAnd
    the production of Chalkboard is simply one more clue that points to\r\nApple's
    total abandonment of its commendable typographic sensitivity\r\nof yesteryear.
    The tables have turned, and we need to snap out of denial.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
