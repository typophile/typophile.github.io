  body: "Rudolph Ruzicka designed Fairfield as a text font inspired by Venetian Old
    Face types over a ten year period starting in 1939. The medium weight, as shown
    in the sample image, was released in 1947. Alex Kaczun redesigned Fairfield for
    Linotype-Hell -- I believe he added the elegant flourished capital letters and
    the other alt letters -- which released it in digital form in 1992.\r\nDon "
