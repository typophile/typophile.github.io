  a really old restroom sign that I need to recreate.  I don't need an EXACT match
  but really close would be great.  Thanks in advance!"

    think what threw me was that the post stated \"It\u2019s a really old restroom
    sign\", so I assumed it wasn't actually a font.\r\n\r\nJH\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    And the House Ind.-Poster \u2013 which I\u2019m sitting before all day long \u2013
    helps also a lot. ;^D"
