body: "Hi Colleagues,\r\n\r\nI need a help to find the source of a font. I will be
  very grateful with yours wisdom, helping me to find the source of this font. The
  font is part of my graduate academic thesis, where I write about font revival and
  need, as part of the thesis, create my own revival.\r\n\r\nThe font is attached.
  I am working since many years in this revival and, unfortunatelly, the original
  source is actually lost and I cant\r\nremember where it comes from. Maybe the original
  name is signet, but I am not sure.\r\n\r\nI need a help to fill the blanks. Is it
  possible?\r\n\r\n\r\nChyrllene K,\r\nIntellecta Design\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Image_4117.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: I don't know the original, but there is a digital version of this font called
    <strong>WJPearce213</strong>. The copyright says "Listemageren 1997" but I can't
    find any other info about the designer or a legitimate source to acquire it.
