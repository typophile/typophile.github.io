  target=\"_blank\">Saw this photo this morning and it got me thinking.</a>  Anyone
  know if there are discretionary ligatures in any opentype versions of Futura?  I'd
  like to play around with it, but didn't know if such a thing already exists.  I'm
  pretty sure that those are variations on Futura that they're looking at, but from
  what I can tell there aren't any pre-existing discretionary ligatures of this kind
  out there.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nKC"

  body: paul renner's earliest versions of future contained the ligatures as well
    as the more geometric alternate characters. i know the alternate characters were
    eventually dropped. not sure what happened to the ligatures.
