  body: "The FAMILY LIBRARY lettering is fairly close to Christian Schwartz's \"Giorgio\",
    designed for the NY Times. The sample below is from my Serif Guide. It has a lot
    of alternates, and possibly other widths as well.\r\n\r\n[edit: I should credit
    the graphic as coming from the Schwartzco site]\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/giorgio_full_5453.gif]"

  body: "Okay, so the \"Family Library\" font is actually Elongated Roman. \r\n\r\nMike,
    that was a really creative suggestion. What an eye! I never would've put that
    together.\r\n\r\nNow we're just shooting for \"Archibald.\" \r\n\r\nThanks, folks."

  body: "I think searching for Antique could help, but I stumbled across something
    similar while looking for another font. Check out [[http://www.t26.com/fonts/4753-Teaberry|Teaberry]]
    by William McChesney. In a pinch it might do, or could be modified to be close,
    I think.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
