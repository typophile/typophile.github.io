  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

I'm wondering: should the ampersand be considered as a lowercase or an uppercase letter/punctuation? I'm asking this because I'm not sure I should make this letter a c2sc or an automatic smcp from the original ampersand.

I tried applying some kind of logic to it but there's always some conflict. How is it dealt with normally? Is there some kind of rule or whatever?</div>

Don't include any ampersands in your smcp class. This will leave the default 0026 character as the "(caps with) small caps" glyph. Put the small-cap-height alternate in c2sc, which will activate it via the "all small caps" item in the OpenType menu.</div>

Damn, and I thought God the Almighty at least knows English grammar. What’s with all those sentences that start with "And" in the Bible?

Here is what Fowler says in 'Modern English Usage':

"That it is a solicism to to begin a sentence with 'and' is a faintly lingering *superstition*. The OED gives examples ranging from the 10th to the 19th centuries; the Bible is full of them."

The superstition against beginning a sentence with 'and' is perpetuated by bad school teachers, who are as pedantic as they are ignorant. Ignore them. </div>

Investigated and got this <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/g31.html"><em>link</em></a> from <strong>Dictionary.com</strong>.

I’ve been educated through Irish (Gaeilge) my whole life, if we spoke English in school we were punished. My education of the English language is quite “old school” rather than “bad school” — I sternly believe my teacher fits into the category described at the link above.

While my education was more unusual than most in Ireland (i.e. through Irish), I’m pretty sure all Irish school children were taught English grammar in a similar way. Regardless of this, we have one of the top education systems in the world.

Personally, I find it disruptive, confusing and ugly when I see “And” beginning a sentence, however, I concede to its grammatical validity.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The dictionary.com statement contradicts every authoritative source I have seen on this issue. It is possible to find such wrong statements because this foolish idea is so common amongst poor teachers of English. I have already quoted an authoritative English source on this effort. Here is from an American one, the widely relied-upon 'Chicago Manual of Style': 

"There is a widespread belief--one with no historical or grammatical foundation--that it is an error to begin a sentence with a conjunction such as 'and', 'but' or 'so'. In fact a substantial percentage (often as many as 10 percent) of the sentences in first-rate writing begin with conjunctions. It has been so for centuries, and even the most conservative grammarians have followed this practice."

They go on to quote a writer from 1938, whom they say "fairly sums up the situation even today." He says, "...no textbook supports it, but apparently about half of our teachers of English go out of their way to handicap their pupils by incalcating it. One cannot help wondering whether those who teach such a monstrous doctrine ever read any English themselves."</div>

My heat was, I hope you understand, directed not toward your entirely understandable belief, but toward teachers who mislead their students--and who often punish them for not doing the wrong thing.

		<div class="commentbody">I too was taught not to begin sentences with a conjunction, but it wasn't malevolent, ignorant, or short-sighted. They just wanted to teach one to use language with power and precision, and not be sloppy. Of course, teachers may come to see a beneficial practice as a universal obligation, and standards guardians are apt to become pedants -- but like many things one does in one's protected childhood, such as the range of substances deemed acceptable to ingest, there's more leeway for grown-ups with their sturdier constitutions.

It's an axiom of type design that If It's Possible They Will Do It, so we must be prepared for the collision of bands who decide their name should begin with an ampersand, and typographers who decide that editorial style will set band names in small caps. Strong stuff, indeed.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm of the camp that believes you <strong>should not</strong> begin a sentence with "and." I was taught it this way: a sentence should be able to stand on its on as an individual thought or idea. When it begins with "and" the sentence is completing a previous thought or idea and therefore is not a complete sentence.

As has been pointed out, I think this rule can be broken when "voice" is taken into consideration. If a story is being written in first person, go nuts— but if I'm reading a corporate annual report written in third person it looks <em>wrong</em>. 

Back to ampersands...its best not to make people think too much about it. I'm not as much of a type scholar as many on this thread and I hadn't really thought of ampersands as anything but a "caps" thing. Crazy OpenType menus give me the willies. Keep it simple.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, it's just not necessarily more precise or better. And Terry, even sentences that begin with 'And' can be and usually are gramatically complete sentences. 

I don't really want to argue this as every authority disagrees with you--I just checked two more. 

But if you are so confident that it is always better to avoid an 'and' or 'but' try eliminating the beginning 'ands' and 'buts' in the following and by doing it improve them. If you improve them I will gladly concede your point.  

Here are those lame writers who worked for King James (reflecting the original Hebrew, which has all the 'ands' also):

"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters. And God said: 'Let there be light.' And there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day."

And here is that dabbler Lincoln starting with a 'but':

"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

"Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

"But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. ...."

And here is that fumbler Churchill, again starting with a 'but':

"I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization. Upon it depends our own British life, and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands. But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.'"

These examples can be multiplied at will, both for the 'ands' and the  'buts', with every distinguished author you can name. But these three will keep you busy for quite a while trying to improve upon them ;)

Oh, and one more, a rather articulate fellow writing on type: 

"Economics favor size, and digital culture has come to be dominated by a few companies--arbiters of taste--that rely on a handful of creatives for their content, which they spread worldwide at low margin. Individual purchasers are disinclined to commission local photographers or illustrators when they can get stock for far less. And why buy a contemporary typeface family when you can get Neue Helvetica, 51 fonts, for US$300? Not to mention all the free fonts that come with OS X."

I would say that both the 'and' and the following incomplete sentence are excellent prose style. And maybe the writer, Nick Shinn, when he is not kissing the boots of his misguided teachers, would also agree :)  </div>

My point exactly. I guess you missed the part where I said it depends on "voice" William, because you cited examples from speeches. As far as the Bible goes, you can change those in one of 3 ways:

1) Simply delete the "and"s.
2) Make the "and"s part of the previous sentence using a semi-colon OR
3) Make the "and"s part of the previous sentence using an emdash.

I don't like when we get into using the Bible or other holy texts as references in these matters, but it always seems to go there. As far as I'm concerned they should be off limits in these kinds of discussions, for many other reasons aside from typography and grammar. 

William, I get your point— but sometimes I think you just like to read your own writing. Half a page to make your point? We get it.</div>

However, I still think that the teachers had it right. 
The word "and" at the beginning of a sentence has a number of different meanings compared to when used as a simple conjunction. "Therefore", "consequently",  "furthermore", "then (next)," etc., as opposed to the simple "in addition to". Sure, it's not necessary to draw those distinctions if the meaning of the passage is clear to the reader, and the terse "and" makes for forceful expression. But doesn't it make sense to teach budding writers to shade their language and think more closely about how they're making their point, by using a variety of words with subtle distinctions of meaning, rather than a catch-all?

I agree with your point but I think there is a point that is far more important: 

Irrespective of what is ‘correct’ in someone’s view, I think it is supremely silly to try to enforce grammatical opinion in any language through an OpenType feature simply because fonts are used to set texts in dozens or even hundreds of languages (depending on the character set included in the font). Custom-tailoring a font to work only with German, French, Dutch, English, Czech or any other language is short-sighted.

No, my Biblical example is not first person. And as the experts at Chicago Manual of Style note in my quote above, every kind of literature in English--including well-written reports (and Nick Shinn's writing)--has sentences beginning with conjunctions, as you can easily verify. (I won't bore you with more examples). 

Your suggestions as to how to improve the language of the opening of Genesis will all make it worse, IMHO. The use of the 'ands' here in a sequence of short sentences is key to the rhythm that gives the rhetoric its power. 

Nick, 

I certainly think that teachers should teach different many different ways to make transitions between sentences. And they should explain how they can go wrong, what has better precision and power, etc. What you seemed to defend in your post of 2:11 is that it is advantageous to tell kids what is false--that you should never begin a sentence with a conjunction--and hold them to it as this false instruction is pedagogically good as a stepping stone to later adult practice. I don't agree. I think it is far better just to  teach them how to do it right in the first place. 

If teachers want to require various things as writing exercises, that is fine. But I don't see how teaching wrong rules as right ones is at all preferable.</div>

Computer programs that do automated grammar checking, spellchecking, hyphenation or typesetting should never try to be smarter than the user. A certain amount of aid and guidance is helpful, but software cannot assume that the user is mindless. And a type designer should not treat the font user as being a mindless ignorant. 

The type designer may be the brick maker who creates the ingredients that shape the visible form of language but it is the writer who is the architect of the house, and it is the typographic designer who builds it.

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, I don't really think we're disagreeing all that much. In fact, I would actually say we're largely in agreement. The term "voice" doesn't always have to refer to first person. You're waaaaaaay to literal sometimes. Again...not a fan of using the Bible as an example. I feel its a low blow. I wouldn't be so bold as to say what I wrote above was an improvement necessarily, just another way of writing it. 

Rules can be broken...I wouldn't classifly the Bible as a dryly written annual report. Because of that IMHO, the two styles can't be fairly compared. When a document is rigidly written with little or no emotion or expression, beginning a sentence with "and" just <em>looks wrong</em>. This is more a matter of opinion than something that can be debated and supported with "hard evidence."

Bill, I also find many of your arguments to be devoid of a crucial element. We're all human beings. We have emotions, we have feelings, and our actions are often visceral and come "from the gut." Because you're a writer I'm often surprised by how much you seem to rely on others opinions in order to formulate your own. I'd like to know more about what "Bill" thinks.</div>

I agree that different styles call for different ways of handling transitions, but none that I know of call for a rule against starting a sentence with a conjunction. 

For example here is an 'and' beginning a sentence in IBM's annual report of 2005: 

"We’ve been seeing a transition in services over the past few years, a shift to smaller deals of shorter
duration. These are good opportunities—if you
can recalibrate your sales model to capture them in
addition to the traditional “mega-deals.” And the
profitability of these kinds of deals is very attractive,
if your global cost structure is competitive. We had
to address both our sales model and services cost
structure last year, and we did so. ..."

Not the greatest writing, but it seems perfectly acceptable to me.

The differences of opinion came about when distinguishing between "Caps to Small Caps" (meaning all small caps) and simply "Small Caps" (meaning caps stay as caps and only lower case changes to small caps).

Personally I find #3 the "nicest", but I can see how putting it in the SMCP class makes it hard to use.

Btw how do you make images show up? <img src="link" /> doesn't seem to work...</div>

“Caps to Small Caps” does not mean all small caps. Caps to Small Caps means caps to small caps :) "All small caps" is when both "caps to small caps" *and* "lowercase to small caps" are applied at the same time.

The menu item "all small caps" in the InDesign OpenType menu actually applies two features at the same time.

Which ampersand version for which setting? Not that all users would agree but the font should alow the user the choice.

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, 

thanks for your example, it very adequately illustrates that the standard "uppercase" ampersand should be replaced by a small-cap ampersand in the c2sc feature rather than smcp. This makes sense because ampersand has more of an "uppercase" nature than lowercase.
