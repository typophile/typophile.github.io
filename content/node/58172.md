  a convoluted definition, a mentorship is an opportunity for a protege to be an observer
  first, practice later with the goal of gaining knowledge. Whereas an internship
  is given based on the perceived ability of the person to work right away.\r\n\r\nAs
  you can imagine there is some overlap in that a senior designer or creative director
  may mentor an intern indirectly, but their primary focus is really on getting the
  job done right and on time (as its a business). \r\n\r\nAt least this is how i see
  it. So the end question....is there a place for mentoring in graphic design outside
  of internships? Does anyone mentor young students or graduates? Is this whole conversation
  crazy?\r\n\r\ncheers."

    & apprentice. I've currently got a novice working on becoming an apprentice. The
    novice pays for the training, the apprentice pays for the training with the work
    done.\r\n\r\n--\r\nDavid Bergsland"
