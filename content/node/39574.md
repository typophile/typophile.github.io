  analysis of current events.  The magazine is aimed at the general public, but many
  of our long-term subscribers are becoming older and visually impaired, and are complaining
  that the text is hard to read.  We don't want to increase the font size to the point
  where our typography stands out like a sore thumb as that will turn off new and
  casual readers, so perhaps we could change the typeface to something more legible?
  \ The body text currently looks to be 9.5 pt Times New Roman (clich\xE9d, I know).
  \ I hear that studies have shown that Century Schoolbook is more legible to young
  readers; would it also be more legible to older or visually impaired ones?"

  body: I publish a magazine where the vast predominence of readers are 50+. I switched
    to Century Schoolbook, and we set the type 10/12 - and that had really made the
    readers very happy.

    larger x-height. However, I did not test it in reality for legibility issues compared
    to Times.\r\n\r\nYou could also try Times Seven \r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=205579&grab_id=0&page_id=40489&query=times%20seven&SCOPE=Fonts
    \r\nthat is more robust for small sizes, so you would not actually change the
    typeface that much while improving legibility."

  body: Chase, do you own a paper mill? ;)  12 pt is huge compared to the body copy
    size of most magazines, which generally runs in the 9-10 pt range.

  body: "there's an interesting quote (although I'm afraid I don't know who from)
    that the best way to create legibility would be for everyone to use the same fonts
    for everything. My cynical side says this is why the Royal National Institute
    for the Blind suggest Arial as their font of choice for visually impaired people.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure if this suggestion is viable for your readership,  but you could consider
    presenting a summary of the article in large print at the beginning, offering
    readers the chance to decide if the article is of interest, and worth straining
    their eyes for."

  body: I just finished some large-print business cards which were tested by a focus
    group of adults with low vision, probably even lower than your average senior
    magazine reader, and am currently working on a large-print brochure for a museum.
    Most of my subjects preferred a sans serif face (the serif face looked "busy"),
    but the biggest issue was the boldness of the type. That may be why Arial was
    recommended and why Century SB is preferred by your readers. Both types are darker
    on the page than comparable typefaces in the same weight. My theory is that when
    you take a regular weight face and enlarge it beyond normal text sizes you are
    changing the overall color of the text on the page so there is a higher proportion
    of white space. That makes it harder to distinguish figure from ground. I came
    to this theory after reading two large-print novels myself. (Also, large-print
    is defined as above 14 point.) Now that I am approaching the age when my eyesight
    will be compromised more and more by normal aging, along with millions of baby-boomers,
    I am very interested in how to make it look good.

  body: "Anyone can get reading glasses as they age, but people don't bother.\r\nSo
    they hold the page further away, or slide their glasses down their nose.\r\nIn
    both cases, the type gets smaller, because it's further away.\r\nFine details
    vanish, and clunkers like Century Schoolbook start to look good.\r\nThat's somewhat
    patronizing to your readership, treating the poor old folks like children.\r\n\r\nAs
    a typographer, you can simulate the state of affairs.\r\nRead your page from a
    distance beyond your normal comfort zone, and for good measure in slightly dim
    lighting (the cornea gains opacity with age).\r\nExperiment with type styles and
    setting parameters, and you will find many ways to improve legibility, other than
    going with generic \"research has found\" solutions.\r\nAnd they will be solutions
    that are relevant to your page layout and publication.\r\nTypography and graphic
    design are practical disciplines, not theoretical."
