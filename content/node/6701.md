    target="_blank">Zine Italic</a>. Not quite an exact match, though. Also resembles
    Fago.

  body: Actually, I think it&#39;s Myriad Bold Italic, with an angled terminal added
    to the top of the d, and middle arm of the F raised.

  body: Nice work Marc! Sometimes the answers are right in front of our noses. That

  body: QED is short for &#34;quod erat demonstrandum,&#34; which in Latin means  &#34;which
    was to be demonstrated.&#34; <BR> <BR>It&#39;s the only thing I remember from
    high school trigonometry. ;&#41; <BR>Our teacher would write it on the board after
    he had shown us how to solve some equation.
