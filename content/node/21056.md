body: "Hello. This is my first post here, pardon for my bad english.\r\n\r\nI am working
  on a logotype for \u201Cthe darth vader heritage foundation\u201D (student project).\r\nThe
  brief talks about vader as a \u201Ctragic hero\u201D. This is most important guideline
  to build the logotype.\r\n\r\nI have built 2 versions of the word \u201Canakin\u201D
  (both were once garamond regular) - one for the more \u201Cformal\u201D side of
  the institution and the other for the dark process vader had gone through to become
  the dark lord and become my tragic hero.\r\n\r\nThank you for your comments.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_6243.gif]"

  body: "The deconstructed version is too difficult to read. The formal version doesn't
    do anything for me--it looks like the letters are all from similar, but different
    typefaces. The lowercase a looks awkward to me.\r\n\r\nNeither conveys tragic
    hero to me, but I don't think any typeface could do that. I think that is more
    of the graphic design side.\r\n\r\nAt least you didn't rely on a cheesy Star Wars/Sci-Fi
    font.\r\n\r\nKeep trying."

  body: "can the \"reflection\" like (bottom left) combination function as a logo?
    As far as is tried, the deconstructed looks far more interesting, and the combination
    of them comply as the two sides of the character. \r\n\r\nBut as a shape, too
    wierd...\r\n\r\nI guess working on the upper version to make it more readable
    is what im gonna do. I dont have much time left, almost no time at all."
