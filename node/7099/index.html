My feeling though is that intentionally left some of their tool in the final product &#40;maybe to show process, or whatever&#41;. It is this that perplexes me. Why make your letters look bezier-y?

I think that designing on the screen, as opposed to making drawings and then basing the digital outlines based on those, makes a significant difference as well. <BR> <BR>Indeed, I feel so strongly about this that it now seems likely that I&#39;m going to do a PhD on the very topic. I believe a better curve primitive is the Cornu spiral. I&#39;ve just built a prototype curve editor using the primitive &#40;see <a href="http://casper.ghostscript.com/~raph/ppedit.png">screenshot</a>&#41; and so far am very encouraged that the resulting curves are smoother and more natural than those designed interactively with Beziers. <BR> <BR>No doubt you&#39;re going to hear a lot more on this from me, but  I wanted to post a quick note now because it seemed on-topic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">hrant: that&#39;s a complex question. The short answer is that you can go from Cornu spiral to quadratic or cubic Bezier with insignificant loss, as long as you have enough precision in the coordinates [in fact, my interactive editor converts to Beziers before rendering to the screen]. So there&#39;s no problem outputting PostScript code that has high-precision float coordinates followed by &#34;curveto&#34; operators, but an unsophisticated transform to TrueType or Type1 can introduce significant errors. <BR> <BR>So, in order for this stuff to be useful for type, the output module has to be smart enough to avoid those errors &#40;briefly, very short arcs are the enemy&#41;. Of course, the exact same thing is true of stroke offset algorithms &#40;the constant-distance offset curve from a quad bezier is a complex fifth-order polynomial that can get quite numerically snarly where the offset radius gets close to the curvature of the Bezier&#41;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Why the Cornu spiral as opposed to other spirals? Good luck with the dissertation!</i> <BR> <BR>Thanks! That&#39;s a good question. I&#39;ll try a brief answer. <BR> <BR>1. It&#39;s one of the few spirals that has an inflection point in it, or in other words contains an &#34;S&#34; curve. Most other spirals only wind one way. <BR> <BR>2. In fact, it&#39;s got a number of useful shapes hiding in there. At the inflection point &#40;t=0&#41;, it closely fits a basic cubic polynomial &#40;essentially the same curve you get when trying to make an &#34;S&#34; in a cubic Bezier&#41;. At roughly t=0.6, it closely fits a parabola, which is the geometric primitive of a quadratic Bezier &#40;TrueType&#41;. And as t increases, it closely fits a circle. <BR> <BR>3. It&#39;s the smoothest way to interpolate between curvatures. In fact, designers of roller coasters and highway on/off ramps use the curve to smooth out the lateral g-forces. If you were to ride a motorcycle along, say, the &#39;s&#39; from Auto Italic 3, you&#39;d be in for some rather violent shifts of g-force. <BR> <BR>4. It has deeply beautiful mathematical qualities. The more I study the curve, the stronger my intuitive feeling of rightness. For the details, you&#39;ll have to wait for my thesis &#40;how&#39;s <i>that</i> for a cliffhanger?&#41;. <BR> <BR>I should have linked a <a href="http://casper.ghostscript.com/~raph/cornu.pdf">PDF</a> of the Cornu spiral, so that you can see the curve I&#39;m talking about. <BR> <BR>Type design does expose materials and methods. To me, cubic Beziers are like carving letterforms into rough pine wood with knots &#40;pun intended, of course&#41;, while Cornu spirals are like carving into pear wood. If you&#39;re going for an effect, the former makes sense, but given the choice, most of the time a seasoned craftsman will go for the latter.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;At the inflection point &#40;t=0&#41;, it closely fits a basic cubic polynomial  <BR> <BR>I get it. Bezier curves are easier to work with than quadratic splines because, being based on cubic equations they can do the &#39;s&#39; shape, which would take two quadratic splines, and hence more &#39;knots&#39; to move around. And you&#39;re saying the Cornu spiral can do this and a lot more.  <BR> <BR>I guess the question is whether you can put the equation in some kind of parametric form with &#39;knots&#39; and &#39;handles&#39; as Bezier did. Bezier has the two end points and the two handle points that define the curve, which you can move and see how the computer redraws the cubic curve.  <BR> <BR>It sounds like the Cornu spiral is more complex than a cubic equation. Will you need a fifth point, a third &#39;handle&#39;, to adjust other features of the &#39;s&#39;? So then your work would look something like a Bezier and a quadratic spline together - an off-curve point, and the two tangent handles? Or will you need a fourth handle as well? There is the danger that it will be too complicated to work with.  <BR> <BR>Sounds like a great idea - best of luck with it!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>It sounds like the Cornu spiral is more complex than a cubic equation.</i> <BR> <BR>It depends on what you mean by &#34;complex&#34;. Beziers can be computed using only high school algebra, while the mathematical basis of the Cornu spiral is the Fresnel integral, a &#34;special function&#34; that requires a bit more mathematical skill to work with. <BR> <BR>But if you&#39;re talking about complexity from the user&#39;s point of view, Cornu splines win hands down. Once you nail down the endpoints, a Cornu spiral segment has only two degrees of freedom, the same as a quadratic Bezier &#40;and two less than a cubic&#41;. In short, it&#39;s as simple to use as a quadratic, but every bit as powerful as a cubic. <BR> <BR>Of course, the real test is how natural it all feels in the context of an interactive editor. I&#39;ve built one &#40;for Linux only, so far&#41;, and so far am <i>very</i> encouraged. I&#39;m eager to get it in the hands of typophiles &#40;as opposed to math nerds&#41; so I can get good feedback from the real world. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for the encouragement! I have a meeting with my advisor tomorrow, so all this feels like a wind at my back.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the link to the cornu spiral picture, Ralph. Your project is fascinating. I presume you&#39;re familiar with the work of Philippe Coueignoux, whose parametric font design system &#40;never more than experimental, I think&#41; he made while at MIT in the 1970s used spirals of some kind. <BR> <BR>Can you elaborate how you can transform spiral segments? Do you use 3D perspective transformations, for example? <BR> <BR>I love your comment about &#34;designers of roller coasters and highway on/off ramps&#34;. I&#39;ve occasionally wondered if there&#39;s any maths in the trajectory that the good driver tends towards, when attemping to drive quickly and &#40;therefore&#41; smoothly.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Laurence: yes, I have come across the idea that Coueignoux used spirals, but have had little success tracking it down. His 1975 <a href="http://theses.mit.edu/Dienst/UI/2.0/Describe/0018.mit.theses%2f1975-64?abstract=">thesis</a> seems to be based on polynomials. <BR> <BR>Is my memory faulty, or did he not go on to work for one of the major typesetter vendors of the day? Possibly Compugraphic? Perhaps there was a later proprietary font format that was based on spirals. <BR> <BR>A little more background on Coeignoux is in this <a href="http://www.wfschreiber.org/technical/type%20coding%2087.htm">note</a>  by William Schreiber.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><i>And with slope continuity &#40;with adjacent segments&#41; at those endpoints?</i> <BR> <BR>Right. Enforcing the tangent continuity across a knot point eats up one degree of freedom. The best representation, then, for a manually drawn Cornu spline is a &#34;spinner&#34; for the tangent angle at each knot point. Using an off-curve point instead of the tangent angle has the drawback of not handling &#34;S&#34; curves well; the two tangents could well be parallel to each other, so they would never intersect. <BR> <BR>The curve editor I&#39;m working on assigns the tangent angles automatically, as well, so all the user needs to put in are the on-curve points. I&#39;m going to make the tangent spinner optional at each knot; it seems to me especially useful at corner joins and joins with straight line segments. <BR> <BR>At knots where the tangent is chosen automatically, there is curvature continuity as well as tangent continuity. My sense is that when typophiles talk about the &#34;bezier-y&#34; feel of an outline, it corresponds fairly closely to the mathematical concept of disconuities &#40;or wide variations&#41; in curvature. Cornu splines are extremely good with respect to that criterion. Perhaps even optimum; it&#39;s a question I want to study. <BR> <BR><i>Maybe the Cornu spiral will seem so natural that one will get a good result with only the one point in addition to the end points, but I wonder.</i> <BR> <BR>That is more or less my claim. Since the concepts of &#34;seeming natural&#34; and &#34;good result&#34; are so subjective, I intend to test that claim by putting the curve editor into people&#39;s hands. <BR> <BR><i>Can you elaborate how you can transform spiral segments? Do you use 3D perspective transformations, for example?</i> <BR> <BR>No, it&#39;s simpler than that. I just cut a piece of the original spiral &#40;the two degrees of freedom mentioned above correspond exactly to the points along the original curve where I cut&#41;, then scale, rotate and translate so that the endpoints of the spiral section coincide with the desired endpoints.</div>
