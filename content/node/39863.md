  (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/saa/series-f-d/)\r\nafter many, long searches
  it's exactly what i'm looking for.\r\n\r\nbut the problem now is: there are no lowercase
  letters available and i want to use it for copy, documents, web and much more, too.
  do you have an alternative in mind, which is very close on shape? i would be happy
  about every hint.\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\njan"

    is similar, but unfortunately isn't as extended as SAA, although it does have
    a ton of weights to play with.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
