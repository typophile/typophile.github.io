  Bureau Grot Extra Compressed Black, a font that would work well with a current project.
  However, the going rate (5 fonts for $175) is a bit beyond my reach, and I can't
  pass the cost along because the piece is pro bono. Is there a cheaper alternative
  for either the specified font or a viable alternative?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    per weight</a> and FontShop (like others) offers a student discount of 10%. Contact

  body: "Stephen -- \r\n\r\nClarification: The going rate for FB fonts is $40 per
    weight <em>for singles</em> and <em>through resellers</em>. \r\n\r\nFont Bureau's
    own direct Retail site gives quantity discounts. So at 3&#150;5 styles the per
    font cost goes down to $35 (thus the $175 rate quoted above), and 6 or more styles
    drop to $30 per. Further discounts above 16 styles. \r\n\r\nThese are the single
    workstation rates, and styles may be mixed across families.\r\n\r\n(More info
    at http://www.fontbureau.com/help/quickpricingchart)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
