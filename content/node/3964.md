  target="_blank">Priori</a> &#40;from <a href="http://www.emigre.com/" target="_blank">Emigre</a>&#41;
  an eclectic set of display faces. It is similar to Jonathan Hoefler&#39;s <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/proteus/index.html"
  target="_blank">Proteus Project</a>, in the sense that a given underlying structure
  becomes the base for a mixture of eclectic fonts that somehow work very well together.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not saying Priori and Proteus Project look similar, I&#39;m just
  noticing a similarity in the approach to building the family. <BR> <BR>Is this a
  fair comparison? Are there other font families that take a similar approach? What
  do you think?

    target="_blank"> the Shire Types</a> &#40;Tankard&#41; seem to be doing something
    similar, too.
