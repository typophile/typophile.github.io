  body: I just did a demo of this feature in my lecture series I conducted in Dallas
    last month. You can get the vector image to look exactly like te sketch if you'd
    like. with fewer than four clicks. The nice thing is, of course, that the image
    can then be enlarged to any size you like without any resolution issues.

  body: You have to fine tune it but it will duplicate your drawing if you practice
    enough to master the tool.

  body: Fiddle with the Trace Options. You can get it to just about match exactly.
    I've gotten some remarkable detail on color photographs that look very close to
    the originals, so this b/w should be doable.

  body: One more thing you might try would be to scan your original drawing larger,
    so that the details are larger and any averaging by Live Trace will be lessened.

  body: "I miss StreamLine. It doesn't appear that Streamline's feature set was fully
    absorbed by AI (or perhaps I just incorrectly remember StreamLine's capabilities
    as being better than they were).\r\n\r\nAnother option is to trace it in Flash.
    Flash has some decent auto-tracing features as well."

  body: "If you aren't afraid of the command line <a href=\"http://potrace.sourceforge.net\">potrace</a>
    does an excellent job (better than any commercial tracers I've seen). If the command
    line isn't your thing, there is a java based GUI available for potrace that will
    output SVGs. I haven't used it, so I can't vouch for its user friendliness. The
    GUI called <a href=\"http://delineate.sourceforge.net\">delineate</a>.\r\n\r\nThat
    being said, the drawing is a little hairy for auto-trace. If you want it to look
    sketchy, you would be better off using a high res bitmap. If you want a clean,
    smoothed out vector version you would probably be better off tracing it by hand
    in Illustrator/Vector software of your choice."

    what you get. I ended up with a vector image that was almost indistinguishable
    from the original:\r\n\r\n\r\nPlace image in Illustrator.\r\nScale image up about
    30-50% (it may look pixelated, but don't worry)\r\n\r\nSelect image -- Go to Live
    Trace -- Trace Options\r\n\r\nFrom the default, swith to the following settings
    (and, again, experiment on your own if you'd like):\r\n     MODE: Grayscale\r\n
    \   MAX:  6 colors\r\n    PATH FITTING: 1 px\r\n    MIN AREA: 1px\r\n    CORNER
    ANGLE: 10\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you'd like, I can send you a pdf of my result. As I stated,
    it was pretty much exactly like the original.\r\n\r\nGive it a try, and good luck!\r\n"
