  body: I think i didn't explain clearly what i meant... the typeface actually has
    the diagonal lines through it as a part of the face, not a photoshop or illustrator
    effect, I have Trade Gothic but I particularly want the line effect through the
    typeface. I suspect it's a free font as the cover pictured is from a church update
    and the other place I saw it was student work at my college and we're too poor
    to afford to buy type! anyone else have any ideas please??

  body: Well, it would certainly be worth considering photoshopping the Trade Gothic
    you own if you want to save money. Of course it depends on the use you want to
    put it to - EULA comes to mind.

  body: How come this is not a Photoshop/Illustrator effect? The sample shows two
    different sizes of the font, but the diagonal lines remain the same in thickness/seperation.
    That wouldn't be the case if this was a font.

  body: I agree with Barthak. They just knocked the face out of the background and
    put the lines behind it.
