  people posting here. So, now it's my turn to post for the first time.\r\n\r\nI'm
  working on a logo for a Norwegian incentive travel agency - Authenticore(.no) -
  which focus on the experience and personal development one get from authentic meetings
  between people - as opposed to luxurious 'vacations', which are the rule more than
  the exeption in the incentive travel world.\r\n\r\nI want to make a kind of 'signature',
  with a human touch. Not having much experience with handdrawing logos like this,
  I've come to a point where I have become quite blind, and therefor need some feedback.
  Thank you very much![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Authenticore1.png]"

  body: "at first glance, it's a nice start. My personal opinion, and someone with
    greater knowledge cam come along and correct me later, is the A bar weight seems
    to be going in the wrong direction. It would seem to me that the left should be
    thicker as it's the start of the stroke and therefore more ink would gather there.
    The tail on the _u_ pulls away too far up and out for my liking. I haven't made
    up my mind on the _th_ combination and the counter in the second _e_ seems larger
    than in the first.\r\n\r\nOverall though I quite like it. I hope you get more
    insightful feedback. \r\nCheers!"

  body: Looks a bit loose overall. Try "tracking" everything in. I agree with the
    rest of what jselig said.

  body: "Just for comparison have a look at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=brody\">Brody</a>
    or similar. The stress on the e is wrong, th should probably join from the bottom
    of the t's vertical to the top of the h rather than from the bar. Generally the
    letters seem to get lighter as the word goes on, adjusting the kerning should
    answer some of that. I would increase the x-height of the r to bring the vertical
    to the same height as the others, the 'or' ligature is too light. The A's uprights
    are a little bowed and have a start-of-the-stroke which isn't reflected in the
    other characters. I would also look at more horizontal bars on the t, presently
    it gives the feeling that the logo should raise up on the left, something that
    is exacerbated by the low stroke on the A.\r\nTim"

  body: "I really, really like it. Very nice. Even as it is now it would already make
    for a nice lettering logotype.\r\n\r\n<em>( The only things that would slightly
    bother me may be the bow / top loop of the 'h' and the 'or' combination. I think
    the 'problem' with the 'or' may be that it may seem / appear too thin, compared
    to the other connections. And the connection and 'loops' could be slightly 'smoother'
    as well. And something bugs me about the first 'e' but I cant really define what
    that may be. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"
