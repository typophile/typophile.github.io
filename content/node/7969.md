  the follow-up. <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Hello people. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m doing a logotype for
  a group called Melk. <BR>http://www.madshougaard.dk/typophile/melk_1.gif <BR>I started
  out with this &#40;very loosely outlined - no consistency whatsoever&#41; <BR> <BR>Then
  decided it was a bit too &#39;sharp&#39;, so I reworked it, trying to get a Cooper
  / Sauna Black -quality to it: <BR>http://www.madshougaard.dk/typophile/melk_2.jpg
  <BR> <BR>..then decided it was, after all, a bit too loose. <BR>http://www.madshougaard.dk/typophile/melk_4.gif
  <BR> <BR>However, I did like the slanted look of the previous sketch, so I did this:
  <BR>http://www.madshougaard.dk/typophile/melk_5.gif <BR> <BR>Something doesn&#39;t
  look right to me. It is the M I think. Maybe partly the E as well &#40;btw: is it
  legible?&#41;. <BR> <BR>Please comment... <BR> <BR>regards, <BR>Mads'

  body: 'I think your sketch is sweet! Kerning aside, i think it&#39;s got a more
    accurate baseline and a more descernable form for the &#39;e,&#39; a better series
    of terminals, and, well, I dig the curves.  <BR> <BR>Not knowing who this hiphop/electronica
    folks are, I can&#39;t tell you whether or not the fluid is better for them, but
    I know visually I find the sketch more interesting, and more cohesive. The strokes
    on the &#39;m,&#39; for instance, are a lot more similar to the rest of the letters,
    where as the digitized versions don&#39;t quite match.  <BR> <BR>I think the angle
    of the &#39;m&#39; strokes aren&#39;t supported by the angle of the &#39;e,&#39;
    which appears to be violently attacking the m. maybe if the left corner of the
    e was not a corner this would be different. <BR> <BR>Anyway, rock on, this is
    interesting stuff! <BR> <BR>Aaron <BR> <BR>EDIT: I just noticed that in your hand
    drawn sketch, the &#39;lk&#34; ascenders are not really lined up, which I think
    is a great detail and could help liven up your digital versions!'

  body: Hi Aaron, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the comments! You make some interesting points..
    I&#39;ll try to work at it. <BR> <BR>To some degree I also think the sketch is
    best.. still; I think it gets too soft for them. Guess I&#39;ll have to try to
    balance the soft / hard details better.. <BR> <BR>Mads

  body: 'hi! <BR>I think the &#34;where I am now:&#34;, nr 1. version is more legible.
    at nr. 2 the e and the k&#39;s hmm... righ side is quite alike, which makes them
    read the same. so in the worst case i could read &#40;if i realy want to <IMG

  body: Hi Greg,  <BR> <BR>Thanks for looking into it. I like your take on the K..
    however, I think it&#39;s turning to a direction that&#39;s not quite right for
    this. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve made a new M. It&#39;s been a struggle. Is it too different
    from the others?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56003.gif"

  body: hey - the e in your sketch...I think you might need the curve in the eye from
    the sketch onto your comps. in fact if you traced your sketch excatly, smoothed
    out some curves, I think you got something, well I like it at least, rather then
    the hard lines. <BR> <BR>strangely enough before your last revision I can&#39;t
    quite see the e - seems more like &#34;c&#34; or just some undesernable glyph
    but when you flipped the m, I see more e-ness, but the direction bothers me -
    unless you extend the strokes on k to the same degree and lenght for some sort
    of balance? <BR> <BR>just my tidbits. <BR>-t

  body: I also like the e in your sketch, but the m and k look sort of like Hebrew.
    You&#39;ve rectified this largely in the last revision, but I second Tanya&#39;s
    suggestoin regarding the curved eye. Bring back the curved body, as well
