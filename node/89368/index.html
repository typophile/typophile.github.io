  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greetings. This is my first post. I have only recently begun to appreciate the distinctions of typestyles and their importance in aesthetics. This was largely initiated by watching the movie Helvetica, an interesting short documentary.

In any event, I have come to appreciate the superiority of Helvetica over Ariel, and I was thinking of buying Helvetica for my PC, but then I stumbled into Helonia, which is a font included on my computer.

Some quick internet reading revealed that it is indeed a Helvetica copy, but I cannot find any good (or even bad) analysis of any subtle differences between Helvetica and Helonia, not even here using the search function for the word Helonia.

Any thoughts or opinions on Helonia or Helvetica vs Helonia would be greatly appreciated.</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Helonia is a clone and is shareware. It seems to be available in a free trial version for a specified period of time; thereafter you have to pay for it.

Given that it is a clone, even if it is free, personally I would ignore it and buy the real Helvetica. Since most of the graphics world uses the real Helvetica, you may run into problems of matching previous works if you try to substitute a clone.

Rubicon Computer Labs, the company that made the fonts, has their story here: www.rubicon.ca.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for the reply. I think I will be buying Neue Helvetica #2 value pack from fonts.com, because I like the included thinner #35 weight, which is nicer than the Helonia that came with Microsoft Works, which appears to be about a #45 weight.

Still, I am a curious about the definition of clone when used to describe type. Normally one would understand the term to mean indistinguishable, but if one could have problems matching previous works, does that not imply there are differences?

And thanks for the link. Rubicon has some appealing sans serif fonts, at what appear to be respectable prices. The idea of looking for fonts beyond what is included with whatever computer one has is a new and intriguing experience.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Type designers seem to use "clone" to mean a face that is intended to be directly comparable to another existing face, to the extent that they are essentially interchangeable. Often a clone will have exactly the same metrics (character widths) as the base font, so that it can be substituted without causing text to reflow. Some clones, like Arial or "Book Antiqua" (= Palatino) were made to avoid paying the licensing fees for the originals, which is why they are viewed as unethical copies, even if there was technically nothing illegal about making them.</div>

Personally I would ignore both of them.

John, it's wonderful that the Helvetica movie has triggered in
you an appreciation of type. But to me the most cogent opinions
in the movie are the dissenting ones, such as Erik Spiekermann's.

Spending money on a font that has in effect lost its soul (nevermind
that it's improperly spaced to boot) isn't something I can recommend.
Now that you've acquired the "bane of awareness" :-) spend some time
finding a more interesting typographic voice to adopt and nurture.

		<div class="commentbody">hhp, having only seen the movie once, I am unable to recall the dissenting viewpoints all that well, but it seems to me that the most iconic objects in human history evoke strong dissenting opinions as much because of probability distribution laws as any flaws in the object. In other words, it is impossible to create a font that would be loved by everyone, forever. The negative viewpoints might often be a reaction to Helvetica's success, and this is understandable.

By analogy, as a casual guitarplayer, I spent several decades playing and owning many guitars other than a Stratocaster, solely because I had something against it. It is by far the most successful guitar in history, and I objected to being party to something so common. Then about three years ago, on a lark, I decided to buy one, just to confront my prejudices, and to try to learn why people say it is the pinnacle of electric guitar design. I now undertand why they are so highly regarded, and common. After avoiding them for decades, they are the only electric I enjoy playing today. 

In any event, I have an open mind, and I am curious to know if you have any recommendations for a sans serif font to adopt for body text that is easy to read and for lack of a better word, classy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just to add something else to the conversation, and speaking about aesthetics in general, I am not sure it is possible to defend an argument that Helvetica is improperly spaced, and I have to borrow another musical object to make the point. 

Violins are bilaterally symmetrical, however, many of the greatest violins by the Cremonese masters (stradivari, Del Gesu, Bergonzi, etc.) have subtle bilateral asymmetries, and there are those who would say that these idiosyncracies, which could just as well be called flaws, are part of the attraction.

 It seems to me that there are an infinite number of possible spacings for a font, and each will lend a slightly different flavor to the text. Whose to say which one is definitive. I would love to see samples of the same text kerned in various ways, to learn something about this variable.

IMAO, Arial and most helvetes look rather dull to me on their own. Seems to me that the trick to spicing up their life is to pair them up like Laurel&Hardy (Gøg&Gokke).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">All right, so I was going to keep my opinions to myself and just try to answer your basic questions, but where's the fun in that?

You begin by stating that you're starting to appreciate the subtle distinctions between Helvetica and Arial, which is admirable, I suppose, but not really what typography is about. I would identify as a complete type nerd, a real typophile who earns something of a living playing with type, and I have to say I can't appreciate any such subtle distinctions. Or perhaps I could spend my time looking for them in order to confirm that Helvetica is a more original and successful design than Arial, which I already knew, but I just don't see the point. Helvetica is ugly, first of all. Well, in order to not start another love/hate Helvetica thread, of which I'm sure there are plenty, I'll say that Helvetica is the archetypical example of a "realist" or "grotesque" sans serif. But just because it is perhaps the most recognizable or most pervasive example of a genre, do we automatically assume it is the best? It wasn't the first and it wasn't the last, so why the obsession? Even if Helvetica is the best Swiss sans serif, who says that this is the most important category of typefaces, or that — even more importantly — it's the most interesting?

I doubt that the gainsayers of Helvetica hate it because it is too perfect and they are jealous of its success, or that their dissent has anything to do with "not being able to please everybody." Helvetica never tried to please everybody! There is really not very much reason to hold it up as the pinnacle of typographic achievement. It is a font, which may or may not be appropriate for whatever you happen to be typesetting, and just like any other font, it will be the wrong choice most of the time.

But I want to come back to the fact that it simply is not the most interesting typeface in the world, so if you want to dive into typography — which you should do, by all means, and have a blast — why not choose a more interesting tool to play with? Get Helvetica if you like, but before studying the 1001 microscopic differences between Helvetica and Arial, explore some of the incredible breadth of typographic expression. Play with some other faces and learn about the evolution of type and how we ended up at Helvetica. Learn where our alphabet comes from, study calligraphy and stonecarving and learn how to use a letterpress and a typewriter and all the other tools that brought typography to where it is now. I guess what I'm reacting to is your claim that you've been inspired to learn about type, and the most interesting thing you can think of doing is studying Helvetica. Maybe it's just me, but I think there's a world of things about type that are more interesting.

Have fun on the journey!

Edit: And about the type being "improperly spaced," this is an element of the craft, as opposed to the art, of type design. It's a technical requirement that type be spaced well in order to read well. Even if you wanted to use improper or inconsistent spacing on purpose, as a stylistic choice of some kind, you need to remember that we're talking about a famously consistent typeface in which such a choice actually contradicts the pure modernist aesthetic of the font itself. Make sense?</div>

Here's a thought. Why not play with a serif/sans family, like Scala? The sans stands quite nicely on its own, but also complements the serif, and you can then explore how the two are similar and differ. I would consider Scala classier than Helvetica, both because of its appearance (debatable) and because of its provenance (fact). It certainly has a very different feel, being more humanist and more open.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting post Joshua, and I find merit to many of your points, so I am glad you elaborated. Mind you, the differences between Helvetica and Arial are not subtle to me, even as one extremely new to typestyle minutiae. I would love to respond in greater detail, but my answer would be general, even philosophical, and too far removed from the topic of typestyle, so I will have to take your advice and do more studying first. 

I will only say that there is something oddly fascinating about Helvetica. For the time being my conjecture remains that it indeed possesses some intangible quality not found in other typestyles, but I reserve the right to be wrong.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John*, you make some valid points, and defend them eloquently; there is
no shortage of cases of people unduly shunning something simply because
it's popular. Consider all those who disdain Barcelona's football club; and
I myself could never support Scuderia Ferrari - it's just too easy.

* And please call me Hrant.  :-)

However certain opinions, such as the ones Spiekermann expresses in
the movie, are founded on more than mere emotion. Helvetica is used by
too many entities that represent too broad a spectrum of connotations
to maintain the focus necessary in a good font. Also, the spacing is indeed
off (it's too tight), and -as Joshua states- this is not simply a matter of
taste; one of the dark secrets of typefaces that you will be discovering is
that a font's various attributes -specifically here its vertical proportions,
color (meaning weight) and spacing- have to be in sync for it to click for
continuous reading, something which furthermore can only happen for
a narrow range of point sizes (for a given font).

I would suggest that you enjoy seeing good qualities in Helvetica simply
because -via the movie- it has become your personal gateway into this
fascinating new world, and turning your back on it seems a betrayal.

If you'd like to explore other sans fonts, and delve deeper still into this
black craft (because it's not an art) you might want to study the unique
Legato, concerning which I once wrote a review - see the last entry here:
http://typographica.org/2005/on-typography/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2004/
There's also much good discussion on Legato on Typophile.

		<div class="commentbody">hrant, thanks for the detailed post. I wonder if it might be unreasonable to hold something against Helvetica because of any connotations related to who uses it. When I discovered that Helvetica is used by such a broad spectrum of companies I was surprised that it can still look unique when accompanied by various other qualitative changes. I realized this through an interesting website quiz:

One does not get the impression of sameness from one logo to the next, at least based on the fact that like every other consumer, I have been staring at these exact logos for ages and never realized they all use the same typestyle. Perhaps the sameness is glaring for one who is a long time typophile.

I think there exists (in theory anyway) a prototypical font that transmits requisite information in the most efficient or universal way. I am wondering if Helvetica's overrepresentation is because it comes closest to this ideal. It's just a thought. If true, it would not be a statement attesting to Helvetica's quality (which appears to be debated) but rather to its coming closest to the idealized basic font. But I suppose these kinds of arguments have already been proposed and debated for a long time, and I am late to the table. 


HVB, that was one  of my questions to font.com, whether there is a difference between Helvetica bold and Helvetica merely rendered bold by the bold function on a word processor, and apparently there is. I am wondering how much of a difference there could be for small font sizes like 12-14pt., but I am going to accept the opinions of others that there is a difference.

I have used many different typestyles over the years, in the casual way any small business owner who communicates and occasionally does their own advertisments might, but I had never given the subject of type any deeper thought. I had preferences, but am only now learning why, and just how small the differences can be while still being influential.

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting quiz you linked to. I got 18 / 20. I often thought the Arial ones looked nicer (gasp!), but I tried to follow the directions and pick out the Helvetica, not necessarily the one I liked more.

If you are willing to accept that typography is a formalized manifestation of writing, then it's plausible that an "ideal" or "prototypical" font would embody the line of a writing implement in the hand of an average writer. Helvetica is (visually) monoline, but no one writes in Helvetica, so far as I know. It does, you could argue, distill the core* of typical typographic letters, while taking stress (stoke weight) out of the picture.

*center? throughline? heartline? Am I making these terms up? I think Gerrit Noodzij had a term for this.

And as you know from the Helvetica film, many designers agree with you about the adaptability of the face. I think it's Vignelli, early on in the film, who says something like "You can say 'I love you' in Helvetica. You can say 'I hate you' in Helvetica." In this respect, it reminds me a bit of theatrical maskwork. It's well known that if an actor wears a neutral, expressionless mask of a human face, audience members will perceive its expression changing depending on the context of the performer's actions. People have been known to ask after such shows, "How did you get the mask to change like that?" when of course it was static the whole time. There is something about a neutral slate that invites viewers to project onto it any number of interpretations.</div>

To someone who is just discovering the subtleties of typestyles and who a week ago would have balked at paying anything for a font when computers come loaded with all kinds of them (notwithstanding the fact that only a few are any good) it is a bit hard to digest.

		<div class="commentbody">John, welcome to Typophile. As a graphic designer my main concern about Helvetica is just that it can look dated because it was so heavily used in the 80s and 90s. It's a bit like wearing an old suit that was in fashion when you were younger but not so much now. 

However it's still used quite a bit, and many corporations still specify Helvetica (or Arial) as a corporate font. One suggestion is to stay away from Helvetica Medium or Bold for headlines and instead use one of the lighter, condensed weights for heads.

This is a misleading comparison. The point of nice fonts is not to learn their secrets, but the opposite — to delegate more work to them, with the understanding that their methods will remain mysterious. Sure, one can abuse any font, but it's not like buying an expensive Les Paul, which can only sound as good as the player. It's more like buying an expensive pair of stereo speakers. All your music will sound nicer, with no extra effort from you. Well, aside from opening your wallet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, welcome to Typophile. There is an important point I think you have not fully appreciated yet, from the above discussion. That is, different fonts work for different purposes. The question in design is not "what is the ideal typeface" but what typeface will best suit a particular design and purpose. 

As Hrant said, Spiekerman really nailed it in the movie when he said, "Helvetica is fat in the middle," and like a fat man, it needs space around it to breathe. If you use a few words of Helvetica Bold with a lot of white space around it, it's going to look good—with a particular look, but it does work well. If you use it in printed text at small size it's going to "look like dogshit", as Paul Rand put it. 

Because Christian Schwartz is a very savy type designer, he did a different design for text, and I'm sure it's better. But personally I think there are problems with the style that make it less than optimal for any fairly extended text. To me humanist sans read more easily. The problems with spacing I think come from the design. If you make it tight, it looks good in display. If you make it loose the word images fall apart, so it's usually tight at small sizes, and isn't very readable. So if you want the Helvetica look, yes Neue Hass Grotesk. Just don't think you can use it for everything. 

On screen Arial or Helvetica, at small sizes, is a different matter because the hinting pretty totally changes it.    </div>

True. With a caveat: this doesn't mean all typefaces are
equally bad/good (although some people cling to that).

BTW, due credit for calling Helvetica "fat" goes to
Günter Gerhard Lange. Actually compared to what
he actually said "fat" is a compliment...

> strangely as I've gotten older I've started listening to Elvis

I used to ridicule Elvis. But then it clicked. And it's not about the
lyrics. To me pretty much all lyrics suck* (which is one reason
the Beatles are intolerable). But it's not like I'm a huge Elvis fan.
I prefer Goa, and Classical.

* At least the ones that make sense. Soul Coughing lyrics rule.

		<div class="commentbody">I appreciate the remarks, although I have to respectfully disagree with a few points, no pun intended. My level of discernment in the odd subject other than typestyles (that also have a strong visual component) is very good, and sometimes the skill of discernment in one subject can quickly transfer to another, which is probably why I have so suddenly become enamoured with typestyles. I am detecting and appreciating the subtlest differences in fonts, and for someone like me, the minutiae is where the real fun is.  Likewise, I prefer more non-linear and eclectic ways of accumulating new information, and I do not look at jumping levels as a liability. One merely needs to realize that there will be glaring gaps in ones knowledge, for a while.

The context of typestyle usage is indeed very interesting. Only today have I come to realize how truly awful some signage is. For example, all caps italic serif typestyles should be prohibited for restaurant use. I get the need to match the font to the subject, genre, mood, era, etc., of where it will be used. 

The mystery I am most confronted with right now is how I went so long with using typestyles in such a haphazard and casual way.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I might be betraying too much of my newness to the art, but in my early testing using the font sampling function at fonts.com, I thought Neue Helvetica at 12-14pt looked quite smart for the main body text of promotional content, when used in a <em>very light weight.</em>

I would be grateful if you could elaborate on your sentence: "On screen Arial or Helvetica, at small sizes, is a different matter because the hinting pretty totally changes it."

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks William. Admittedly, my query was not quite what hinting is but rather how Helvetica's impression changes depending on whether it is viewed on screen or on paper. If I had to surmise, I'd say you are intimating that Helvetica, in small fonts, might look better on screen than it will in print because the hinting adds an attribute that will not be manifested on paper. Is this right? </div>

Note that the original poster is planning to license Neue Helvetica, for which Matthew Carter was mostly responsible, if I recall correctly, and as well as being completely redrawn is also respaced. The original Helvetica inherited unitised widths, Neue Helvetica corrected this, and many other inconsistencies, as well as extending the range of weights and widths.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Beatles, Elvis, Helvetica.
All very mainstream.
A good place to start, good things to know about.

**

While I was never a huge fan of either Elvis or the Beatles, of course I like some of their music.
Is that liking some cuts or some weights of Helvetica? 
Never did get to see either of them live. But I have used Helvetica many times.
I would never be able to redraw a face like that, in the way that Carter and Schwartz have, it would bore me crazy.
But I have done several new designs in the grotesque genre.

Both Elvis and the Beatles had a sense of humour. The Beatles, in many of the lyrics they wrote, Elvis, in the way he sang.

One should also make the distinction between liking to use a typeface, and liking to see it used by others.
And again, one may not like a typeface, but nonetheless end up using it because it does the job, for one reason or another.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">>Neue Helvetica, for which Matthew Carter was mostly responsible, if I recall correctly

According to Typographically Speaking: The art of Matthew Carter (2002), Carter did the Greek of Helvetica for Linotype in 1971. If I remember what he has said rightly, he has had *nothing* to do with the latin of Helvetica in any version. 

He has said that Helvetica is an almost perfect rendition of its style, but he has also said that when he had the brief of doing a small version of Helvetica for the phone book, he saw that it was a hopeless model for small size, and drew Bell Century, which has substantially narrower proportions. 

John N., I believe that Arial, hinted on screen has substantially narrower proportions than in print. It is still too tightly spaced, in my opinion, and wider spacing is one of the advantages of Carter's Verdana.
