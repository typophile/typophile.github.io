  its name and I had no idea what to search for to find it... today I saw <a href=\"http://www.fnac.pt/Images/catalogo/livros/xl/9789724150734.jpg\">this
  book</a> and I really wanted to see the font closely! Can you tell me which font
  is it? I didn't find a better image, but I guess this one's enough, it's a pretty
  recognizable font... it's a high contrast, very expressive, almost over the top
  script.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nrubenD\r\n\r\n(Oh, it's probably easier if
  I just insert the image here, so here it goes:)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/9789724150734_4634.jpg]"

  body: "Oh... the correct adjective is \"contrastive\"... sorry 'bout that! My vocabulary
    is a bit narrow, sometimes, as is my articulation... but that's what askoxford.com
    and online forums are for! =)\r\n\r\n\"Contrasty\" does add to the effect, though...
    I can see Mommie more as a \"contrasty\" font than a \"contrastive\" one. :P\r\n\r\n\r\nrubenD"
