  signs of France, and am looking for the closest type match to fake them with.\r\n\r\nThe
  Roadgeek series doesn't have what I'm looking for. I was offered <a href=\"http://simplythebest.net/fonts/fonts/caracteres.html\">Caracteres</a>
  as a possible match, yet the Mac .sit did not contain any font files. Can anybody
  help me out?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/michelin_signs_3722.jpg]"

    and subway signs in different countries. It's one of those things I often find
    myself wondering when abroad.

    Many thanks."

  body: The TTConverter is a freeware to convert Windows-TTF to Mac-TTF. It works
    good or less. So the author Frank Rausch probably means if you want to use the
    font on MacOS >9.x machines try the TTConverter. If you have MacOSX, then use
    the Windows TTF. It works here and there.
