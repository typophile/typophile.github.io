  like some feedback on how many typeface nationalities (German, Swiss, Dutch, etc.)
  there are in the world and how/what are the many typeface moods or expressions you
  think there are. I have looked at several typeface reference books and concluded
  that organization needs help-this is huge especially when I am trying to decide
  on a typeface for a design.\r\nThanks for your help!"

  body: To what nationality would you ascribe today's Featured Face (FF Oneleigh)?
    Designed by a Canadian born in England, an homage to American historicist types
    of the 1920s (Cooper & Goudy), published by a German company.

  body: I would say the nationality is American, because the designer designed the
    typeface for the American usage (like Goudy Old Style)-the nationality heavily
    depends on what style or audience the designer is seeking.

    me, and put the resulting typeface on the market (internationally) and see if
    anyone will license it.\r\nThere's a bit of Koch and Weiss (Germans) in there
    too, and perhaps some Monotype Garamond -- historicism was an international movement.
    And a little of me?"

    of course trends historically speaking and these are worth looking at and thinking
    about. But there is no essential "this-ness" or "that-ness" in a type. '

    doesn't <em>need</em> to be, a priori, but types <em>can</em> very well be strongly
    informed by, and infused with, \xABthis-ness\xBB or \xABthat-ness\xBB given their
    context.\r\n\r\nI would think that in a Globalized Latin-script context, questions
    of specific national/cultural influence might become largely negligible, as it's
    all sort-of washing out and blending together into a transnational mega-context;*
    but then again, these are the contexts were specifically local/national culture
    has become less vital or identity-defining overall, also outside of type. But
    I don't think this can be claimed generally. Think only of Ireland! Also, I would
    assume that for instance in more marginalized societies / [visual] cultures, local/regional/national
    visual traditions/specifics have a more crucial role in defining identity, hence
    are more at the core of people's consciousness, hence designers' consciousness,
    hence also their output. \r\n\r\n* Although I would still argue there is, for
    example, something like a specifically \xABSwiss style\xBB in type design today
    (not to be confused with the historical Swiss Style), showing in the offerings
    of say Lineto or Optimo. "

    but it is not inevitably an aspect of every type.\r\n\r\nJust a few random thoughts.\r\n\r\nWhile
    type gets globalized like anything else typographic nationalisms get rediscovered
    and re-estimated as resources of originality and inspiration.\r\n\r\nCompare Gill
    Sans to Futura (both created at the same time) and you have samples *par excellence*
    for English and German type flavour.\r\nCompare ITC Garamond to Stempel Garamond
    and \u2026\r\n\r\nNowadays, I feel many many \u2013 too many? \u2013 new text
    faces are born and bread Dutch. Not that they were made by Dutch. But many designers
    seem to prefer a certain dutchness in their type, be it consciously or not.\r\n\r\nAnd
    Bodoni might have been Italian."

  body: "Back even in the 1970s (and even 80s), it took some time and a well established
    foundry for a typeface to even be seen internationally.  Today, we see new fonts
    released almost hourly from all over the World. We see each others work in progress
    constantly via internet sites such as this one. International Type design students
    study together at places like Reading and are taught by people who have names
    like, Unger Leonidas, Zhukov, Milo, Chahine, and Kobayashi. It is quite clear
    that now what used to be an international smorgasbord of national styles, has
    become a well-simmered soup of intermingled flavors of the world.\r\nAlthough
    I am living in America, I am far more likely to be discussing type with people
    from The Netherlands, Germany, or India than I am with another America. The old
    national boundaries may still have a bit of meaning in the insane world of politics,
    religion, and economics but in the type world, we are all just colleagues in the
    borderless world of the internet."

    in the future. This is actually not a matter of national boundaries but of national
    and regional traditions.\r\n\r\nWhen I travel to a place where I have never been
    before very few things excite me so much as spoting styles and traditions peculiar

    we are. But that doesn't mean we are all influenced by the same things. We don't
    see the same type treatments every day, we're not exposed to the same kind of
    \xE6sthetics, our signs look different, our shop lettering, our streets, our graffiti,
    the fliers in our mailboxes, the ads in our papers, the papers themselves. We
    don't work from the same historical background, we didn't grow up reading the
    same books in the same fonts, at school we weren't taught the same things from
    the same models, when you were perhaps taught Dwiggins I was looking at Frutiger.
    And so on. I believe these differences, this variety is a thing to cherish and
    sustain. It saddens me if, upon traveling to a new, excitingly unfamiliar place,
    I find that their airport signage looks the same as mine, and their road signs
    feel just like I was back home. \r\nWhile it's massively useful, and sometimes
    enlightening, to be able to harness the possibilities of working (and networking)
    globally and learning from people in a different cultural context, there still
    is both beauty and relevance in the local; the context that surrounds us each
    day, that each of us is rooted in and that is rooted inside us in turn. I don't
    think these 2 perspectives have to be mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\n(Craig: Thanks

    kenneth frampton proposed something called 'critical regionalism': an architecture,
    which although broadly affiliated with modernism, was responsive and able to contribute

    Nina, but I was taught much more about European typography than American. Granted,
    it was the heyday of the Swiss/German modernist era when I studied typography.
    There were several American design schools including mine that were taught mostly
    by Europeans.  The actual and embarrassing truth is that I had no idea who Dwiggins
    was untill I went to TypeCon in New York 5 years ago and heard several presentations
    on Dwiggins from Typophile regulars like Kent Lew and Tiffany (and read her thesis).
    I was introduced to typography in the college classroom in 1963 by Fred Amery
    (a Brittish typographer) , Had fleeting conversations with Jack Stauffacher {An
    American) who ran the schools Laboratory Press; there were two type families only
    available for text setting as foundry type or Monotype, Baskerville and the entire
    Univers family; guest lecturers were several times by Herman Zapf. My sophomore
    year was taught by two Germans from the Ulm School, Gui Bonnsieppe and Martin
    Krampen.  Junior and senior year were taught by Ken Hiebert, an American who had
    just come from 8 years of study with Emil Ruder and Armin Hoffman in Basle. Ken
    \ brought in guest lecturers like Wolfgang Weingart and Karl Gerstner. My first
    job out of Vietnam was at the Westinghouse Corporate Design Center where I worked
    for Peter Megert, a Swiss designer fresh from Bern who was apprenticed to Mueller-Brockman.
    In graduate school at OSU, the typography teacher was Willi Kunz and the rest
    of the design faculty at the time were either trained in Ulm or the Royal College
    of Art. etc, ...\r\n\r\nYes, I am an all-american-boy and make no claim to be
    otherwise but that does not always mean what you might expect. I had better now
    go back and find out who those American guys were back then.  I do remember something
    about a Kelscott Press, though :-)\r\n"
