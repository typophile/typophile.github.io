  body: "There are typos in every part of calt that is meant to sub a ligature with
    its alternate. In b_s, v_s, and w_s, the underscore is only missing from the ignore
    line. o_s is the same but uses the full word \"substitute\", which I thought was
    a valid form, but it must be affecting it somehow. From ograve_s onward, the underscore
    is missing from both lines, which would change \"\xF2s\" to \"\xF2\xF2s\" if liga
    hadn't gotten to it first. From oacute_s onward, the ignore line is also missing
    the _s entirely. And the last three are also missing a space before \"by\".\r\n\r\nNow,
    you could fix all these lines, OR you could REMOVE them and execute calt before
    liga, because you have a whole redundant system in place."
