    also the &#34;6&#34; seems a little weird <BR> <BR>the &#39;C&#39; might have
    the same problem as the &#34;L&#34;, but maybe not... I really like the little
    curl at the end of the &#34;R&#34; <BR> <BR>your work has such a terrific sheen
    to it... reminds me of netbabyworld in that respect <BR> <BR>very nice! '

  body: Ok guys, i fix some problems now i think that i am very close to finish it<IMG
    SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>
    <BR> I decide to put here an example of this font in a simple design, with some
    color so you can look better now, because i think that are too many details that
    are not much apreciate on this size&#40;100%&#41;so if you are agree with me,
    it works better for print, well i hope you can read every single character in
    screen &amp; add your critique or comment, i wil apreciate a lot, thanks <BR>MH
