  body: "Native speakers may correct me, but I think:\r\n\"Noord\" rhymes with \"bored\"\r\nFor
    \"zij,\" think of \"ij\" as a vowel that is probably closest to \"eye\" but colored
    with a hint of \"ay\" "

  body: "This native speaker agrees.\r\n\r\nThe tendency is to pronounce the syllable
    \"zij\" as \"zay\", which is much to close to \"aye\" -- you should aim towards
    something like \"zey\".\r\n\r\nOr listen to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583p49lm3CE
    (\"Radio Noordzij\"; unrelated the typographer!), and be sure to close your eyes
    for the tacky more-than-a-hint-of-that-old Amiga video editing software from the
    '80s :0)"
