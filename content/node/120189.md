body: "Someone an idea which serif font this is? The sample has been scanned from
  a printed (and photo copied) document, so I'm not looking for a font with ragged
  edges or a typewriter-like font. This was an actual sharp font, but due to printing,
  copying and scanning again, it's not sharp anymore.\r\n\r\nI was thinking for Century
  Catalogue as font, but the \"k\" is not correct then. A lot of serif fonts also
  have a capital W where the middle stem is not correct.\r\n\r\nI guess it might be
  a quite 'standard' font on a Windows or Mac system, since I can't imagine that the
  maker of the document (a jeweler) would have used a rare / custom font for this
  document.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the help!"
