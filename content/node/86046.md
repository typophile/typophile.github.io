    maybe on a subscription or something. Would be cool to preview fonts directly

    always comes down to this. :-) the whole glyph palette thing is a distraction
    tactic, kind of like Apple not supporting cut and paste on the original iPhone.
    It's a \"missing\" feature designed to draw criticism away from other more serious
    issues. ;-) or maybe not. \r\n\r\n"

    call it "Two Men & a Boy"
