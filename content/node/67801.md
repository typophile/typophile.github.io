  and I'm sure I already saw it somewhere, recently I think\r\n\r\n[[http://staubman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/megashark-full.jpg|mega
  shark]]\r\n\r\nI'm talking about the titling font, like \"DEATH IN THE SKIES\" (though
  it looks like text font is the same one...)\r\n\r\nAnybody has an Idea?\r\n\r\nThanx
  in advance for your reply :)\r\n\r\nBaz"
