    before</a>:\r\n\r\nSuch news should go into the \u2018News\u2019 section: http://www.typophile.com/news\r\n\r\nPlease
    post your message there and delete this thread. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t move
    it there."

  body: "This is primarily a discussion forum, not a shopfront. To me posting anything
    somewhere that people <em>can't</em> comment is worse than any purported spam
    (nevermind that this particular post is from a reputable outfit dedicated to our
    craft).\r\n\r\nI propose that no thread on Typophile be closed to discussion.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Most of my posts don't include a plug for Shinntype fonts.\r\nWhen I do recommend
    one of my fonts, it is for a particular brief that I think it may be appropriate
    for.\r\nBeing on topic, that's hardly wanton interjection.\r\nIf a topic is being
    discussed, I will often use one of my own fonts as an example, because I'm familiar
    with its design process; that's not a sales attempt, it's primarily sharing knowledge
    -- although it is also publicity.\r\n\r\nSpam is indiscriminate, blanket promotion.
    As a term, it may have derogatory overtones, and hence be ungracious to mention,
    but I use it quite literally.\r\nPosting a marketing newsletter in General Discussions
    is spam. \r\nI've also criticized TypeTogether for this before.\r\nPerhaps it's
    not my job to be so officious, as I'm not a moderator, so in future I will draw
    it to a moderator's attention \"in private\", rather than in the thread.\r\nWhere
    is the link to contact a moderator?\r\nI couldn't find one.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nick,\r\nwhile alerting an admin by leaving a comment in the thread works
    out most of the time (like it did here), sending a direct message certainly is
    quicker and more effective. You can contact any of the admins via this page: http://typophile.com/moderators
    (Yes, I agree that there should be a link to it in the footer or sidebar of every
    page.)\r\n\r\nI have sent a message to the original poster, but haven\u2019t heard
    back yet. I  will delete this thread, but first want to point TypeTogether to
    this discussion and your (fair) remarks \u2013 otherwise, we will see another
    accidentally posted ad in the General Discussions very soon (as I believe this
    has happened out of ignorance, not with bad intentions).\r\n\r\nFlorian"

  body: "> happened out of ignorance, not with bad intentions\r\n\r\nWhich is exactly
    why it's not spam - and everybody knows that.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nYou might BTW want
    to keep this thread for its -admittedly small- educational value. Especially since
    the original post has clearly been neutered of any real content (which BTW has
    tellingly been the case since early on, before I for one ever saw it in fact).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
