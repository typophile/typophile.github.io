body: "First: are people still using enough apps without support for [KERN] that I
  should convert to a plain kerning table when I generate final fonts?\r\n\r\nSecond:
  I created an all-uppercase font, and want to fill in the lowercase characters with
  the uppercase glyphs. It seems like the best option is to expand my kerning classes
  and copy/paste the uppercase characters (with kerning) into the lowercase slots.
  The other option is to just have classes for every character to match the uppercase
  to lowercase but that seems kind of odd. Suggestions?"

  body: "There is no functional difference between class-based or pure-pair-based
    kerning within the \"kern\" feature of the OpenType \"GPOS\" table. \r\n\r\nBut
    the other type of kerning, the old-style non-OpenType \"kern\" table, is still
    needed for OpenType TT (.ttf) fonts. If you don't include non-OpenType kerning
    in .ttf fonts, there will be no kerning whatsoever in, say, Microsoft Word. \r\n\r\nFor
    OpenType PS (.otf) fonts, if you don't include non-OpenType kerning, the Western
    subset of your character set will automatically get \"virtual\" non-OpenType kerning,
    so AV and \xC4V will have kerning in Word but \u0104V will not. \r\n\r\nAs for
    the all-uppercase font, I'd do it by setting up classes this way: \r\n\r\n_A:
    A' a Aacute aacute Adieresis adieresis\r\n_B: B' b\r\n\r\netc. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
