  weights. Any help would be appreciated.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33357.jpg"

  body: This is some version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/artcraft/"
    target="_blank">Artcraft</a>. The original metal version didn&#39;t go that bold,
    so I&#39;m thinking this was a photo display font from the seventies or eighties.
    Headliners did extra-bold versions of older fonts like this, but it&#39;s not
    in the Headliners catalog I have.

  body: Interesting to see in those two URW fonts that the bold &#39;g&#39; is quite
    different from that in the regular weight.

  body: Yeah... The original metal version &#40;Barnhart Brothers &amp; Spindler,
    1912&#41; had the ear of the g pointing left, like the bold URW version. That
    could be a clue as to where this version came from.

  body: 'Okay, I just happened to be looking at an old display phototype catalog and
    found it: Artcraft Black. And, it&#39;s got g&#39;s going both ways. No clue as
    to who produced the face, though. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s available in digital
    format either. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33428.gif"

  body: 'Wow. Thanks to all! Interesting quirk regarding the &#34;g&#34;. Glad you
    found the Black version, Mark. It definitely looked like a heavy headline weight. '
