  Vibes for Bellydancers]]</strong> I mentioned on this forum a few months ago. Thought
  you might like to see how I used Nick's font \"Blandford Woodland\" in a photo gallery
  spread. I bought this awhile back cause it's so beautiful, but never could find
  the right use for it before this. \r\n\r\nHere it is titling the \"Shaman\" costuming
  of a troupe.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot-shaman_6402.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere's
  what it looks like in the context of the spread called \"Fantasy\". The facing page
  featuring the Amazon costume is \"Sultan\" by Cananda type. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot-shaman-amazone_4702.jpg]"

  body: "Here is my layout for the \"Vintage Hollywood\" page, where I used Nick's
    \"Londonderry Air\" to depict the silent film era. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot-vintage-hollywoo_5265.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    \"photo-mounting corners\" are from the Franklin Corners font. I'm old enough
    to remember those little adhesive corners that always fell off after a few decades.
    \r\n\r\nYes, I got permission from the person who posted a high quality scan of
    the silent film actress from his collection.  "
