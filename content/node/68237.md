    It would be quite challenging to create a 2-color version of that logo. There
    is lots of overlapping and transparency.\r\n3. Illustrator, Inkscape, etc. would
    be your best bet.\r\n4. This logo is really organic so I don't think a grid would
    help. I usually start out with pencil/paper...\r\n\r\nHope that helps,\r\nPeter"

    response about this and they said exactly that, as it's primarily for screen use."

    and is scaled down using Photoshop plugins that maintain the image quality better
    than built-in methods. You could try drawing it manually in Illustrator and then
    covert the gradients to steps of solids, but it probably won\u2019t work well."

    a big Photoshop file, if Photoshop seems like an appropriate tool for creating
    your art. Designers work with big files all the time. And only the original file
    will be huge, because copies for distribution will be saved as small EPS files,
    JPEGs, etc. "
