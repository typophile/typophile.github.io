body: "Here is a little experiment I carried out and created this in Illustrator.
  The inspiration came from another logo I found in the ultimate logo bible \"tres
  logos\". I am very happy with it but am not sure it could function as the final
  product and has more space for improvement. What do you think?\r\nNote: this is
  written in arabic and is read from right to left"

  body: "Hey Zahra.\r\n\r\nI think this entry isn't getting any action because: it's
    in your blog, as opposed to being a thread, which makes people more tentative
    to comment; and the title is mundane - try putting \"Arabic/Farsi\" in there -
    they'll all come out of the woodwork!  :-) But also, show \"tavangar\" in a normal
    Farsi text font alongside, so non-readers can be guided a bit.\r\n\r\nAnyway.\r\n\r\nThere
    might be too much variance in there - it could benefit by some simplification
    of form, without making it too dry however. See this: http://www.flickr.com/photos/shch_andrey/4153699318\r\n\r\nBTW,
    you want a real challenge? Try to get it to <em>also</em> say \"Tavangar\" in
    Latin, left-to-right!  :-)  I'm actually seeing a \"T\" and a \"g\" in roughly
    the right spots already...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: A part some unevenness in the thin strokes, especially where they join the
    stems, the "worst" thing I see is the the lonely stroke on the upper left.

  body: "That stroke is the difference between a \"k\" and a \"g\" (the latter BTW
    doesn't exist in Arabic - except if you count the way Egyptians pronounce the
    \"j\"). But I do agree that it needs to be integrated better.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: For "worst" I meant "worst in appearance/execution". I never doubted it was
    there for a reason! :-)
