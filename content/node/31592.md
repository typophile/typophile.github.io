body: "hi all,\r\n\r\nI am starting a typographically based art project. I would like
  to use one large font family - i.e., several weights, italics, ligatures (standard
  and discretionary, if possible), etc. Less commonly used glyphs like fractions and
  so forth are not as important. Also, it should simply be beautiful. (Open to interpretation,
  of course.)\r\n\r\nI'm leaning toward serif faces but both sans and serif are welcome.
  Feel free to throw out the usual suspects, but I'm also interested in more, let's
  say, obscure possibilities. \r\n\r\nOf course, it has to be purchasable (not proprietary).\r\n\r\nthanks
  much!\r\njarrod"

      relevant, I will try to answer it.\r\n\r\njarrod"

  body: "\r\nhey everyone,\r\n\r\nthanks for your suggestions so far - i am enjoying
    looking through them and some are definitely in the running.\r\n\r\none thing
    i had not considered was that some \"families\" contain both sans and serifs.
    for example, FF Quadraat as Jelmar suggested or Scala + Scala Sans. \r\n\r\nit
    may be a matter of semantics, but would you all consider serif versions and sans
    versions to be in the same family? or each their own family?\r\n\r\nto explain
    a bit further what i want to do: i will be making a large scale visual tapestry
    of many distinct pieces of text, ranging from two word phrases to a few sentences.
    so on one level, the viewer will be able to experience the piece as a purely visual
    thing, like a painting. on another level, as viewers moves closer to the piece,
    they will be able to read each individual statement, which - i hope - will provide
    a whole other level of dialogue with the piece.\r\n\r\nwhat do you all think about
    a sans and serif together in this context?\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\njarrod\r\n"

  body: "Usually the sans and serif faces that are in one family, are designed to
    work well together. The one may be derived from the other. Or designed individually,
    but staying close to each other. Usually there is something like a 'skeleton',
    so to speak, to be seen, on which both faces are based.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not sure
    if I would call it 'one' family. Most of them are sold seprately, so based on
    that I would say they are not."

    [[super family]].\r\n\r\nI think you should consider <a href=\"http://beorcana.com/\">Beorcana</a>.
    It's got a bit of that pen-formed/blackletter feel to it, linking it to [[textura]],
    which was thus named because of its appearance of lines being woven together...
    hopefully that make some sense to someone besides me. ;^p"
