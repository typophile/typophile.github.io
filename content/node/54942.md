  a glyph I've been working for a while and need some help in deciding which trend
  to follow, if there's one:\r\n---excuse me by relating the image---\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>#1
  is the most 'normal', being the loop dominates the width</li>\r\n<li>#2 is a variation
  I like: the link is wider than the loop (which is narrower) by its left side</li>\r\n<li>#3
  is similar to #1, except for the inflection in the link</li>\r\n<li>#4 \u2013quirky\u2013
  is similar to #2 (narrower loop), but the sharp link</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nForgive the
  noticeable imbalances: it is the shape as a whole what I'm trying to choose among
  these.\r\nI guess the upper counter and the ear work fine for a text font, even
  though I need to refine the contrasts and the overweight in junctions, but there'll
  be time to.\r\n[[http://typophile.com/files/my_g.pdf|Here I post a PDF]] for better
  inspection.\r\n\r\n<strong>MarS</strong>"

  body: "As you say, 1 and 3 are good, normal forms. I like 2 as well, but wonder
    how it will fit with the rest of the glyphs. I also wonder if you could lengthen
    the descender a bit as well, at least for display settings. 1 & 2 together might
    give some interest for words with two gg's (eggs, for example). \r\n\r\n4 is odd,
    but not unserviceable. What would it look like if the like joined the bowl a tad
    bit higher? (The angle of the straight edge of the sharp link catches my eye.)
    Or perhaps drop the right part of the loop a bit to balance."

  body: "Ah, the hardest [Latin] glyph!\r\n\r\nThe thing about the \"g\" is, I feel
    there's a large gulf between what the reader needs and what other type designers
    expect. There are very few binocular \"g\"s that I personally like, and there's
    a lot of room for improvement on the conventional forms.\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n-
    The closed bottom makes the form too complex - almost Chinese. It does not belong
    in the Latin alphabet (even though we're consciously used it to by now). I'm a
    big fan of the open bottom - although it's much harder to pull off. Even Baskerville's
    is non-ideal - too apologetic.\r\n- The thick top of the bottom bowl should not
    be very horizontal, and -assuming your font has stroke contrast- should get thicker
    on the right. To me the conventional flat, evenly-thick stroke is a disaster*.
    HOWEVER, you probably cannot make the bottom of \"g\" entirely like [most of]
    the rest of the alphabet; it's better to emulate the \"s\". Thanks in part to
    Roy Preston's designer's intuition many years ago, I personally arrived at this:\r\n\r\n*
    Unless maybe you have a \"z\" with thick horizontals.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g_6558.gif]\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    you like. Initially I was not much enthusiastic, but I need to tell that Hrant
    triggered my never-answered ancient doubts (concerns) about the causes of current
    <em>\"too complex - almost Chinese\"</em> shape of lc closed loop g.\r\n I can
    easily assume the transition from the UC to the open lc \u2013it is very appropriate
    considering lc were tied to manuscript writing\u2013, but when I had to face production,
    and the original design was a 'traditional' closed loop g, I felt a big confusion:
    the unnatural changes in the thicknes of strokes, and even the disruption between
    the top and the bottom ones, made me think there was some kind of undecipherable
    secret formula. I don't know why I gave in and went along with the crowd.\r\nFinally,
    I believe my g will be open tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Craig, Merkri and Steve:</strong>\r\nHere
    it goes a \"flogger\" (by the moment I cannot write <em>hamburgefons</em> and
    anyway it doesn't match my purposes) new sample of the quasi-ligature g_g, where

    will be solving the terminal. It needs to stay in the style of the rest of the

    text (printing) sizes \u20136 to 12 points\u2013 at regular weights, being it
    won't work well in screens because of aliasing (hinting for display is quite harder).
    The aim is to resemble some calligraphic gestures \u2013by the other side, usual
    in wood or metal types\u2013 to escape from visual monotony and annoying grays
    in large blocks of text, beyond keeping alive the soul of writing in production.\r\nNaturally,
    the O and the Q, being both are almost absolute shapes in terms of symmetry, make

    sinergically balanced and rhythmic.\r\n\r\n<strong>MarS</strong>"

    happens on Typophile if someone is even slightly harsh in their language\r\n\r\n?\r\nMaybe
    things have been softer lately, but I've been a member since the beginning and
    I can assure you that is not accurate in toto. I happen to know not least because
    I've done a very big chunk of the attacking myself. I've even attacked entire
    design schools, accusing them of superficiality. In fact I did so once pretty
    recently. But I don't expect others to behave like me.\r\n\r\nI must say however
    that people's familiarity with much of my stance in type design (thanks to mondo
    keystrokes on my part) allows me to conduct fewer repetitive attacks these days.
    For example I'm not really a big fan of this font of Marcelo's (it's too chirographic)
    but I think that other people will like it a lot, and I just want to help him
    arrive at a good terminus. There is no perfect font anyway - if I can help him
    make the \"g\" better for example, I feel good. And I think that is one reflection
    of Design versus Art. Here's another example of what I mean: http://typophile.com/node/54841
    \ Note Ben's reaction to my first post.\r\n\r\n> I do not think it was an attack.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know about anybody else, but saying that I don't make fonts was (and was
    in no way constructive - it was just defamation). However you will note that I
    did not strike back, I only defended myself. Not because I don't believe in fights,
    but because I need a much better reason to muster that energy. Sorry Muzz.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI'm
    curious, are there other creative fora where people are regularly harsh, while
    still providing useful feedback (as opposed to simply venting)?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    \r\nIn my eyes, when somebody comes barging in, ripping the previous process to
    shreds, calling the people he doesn't agree with \"people who don't design fonts\"
    (when with a minimal knowledge of Typophile, it's pretty clear that Hrant does
    design fonts) and at the same time, not trying to be clear and helpful to Marcelo's

    noise; it makes the glyph alien (without the benefit of pulling it away from anything
    else). That structure comes from ease of writing, which is pointless in type.
    Having a beak on top is more salient, and allows the top counter to participate
    more. In fact, I have previously tried getting rid of the arm coming up from the
    bottom as well! There is one font that does this*, and quite well, but I haven't

  body: "<em>\"Having the top closed, and then making the \u201Cstroke\u201D continue
    into the bottom is just noise; it makes the glyph alien\"</em>\r\n\r\nAlien? To
    what? To the structure of the Latin alphabet? \r\nI'm assuming you're not using
    the word as opposed to familiarity. I'm not subscribing to Emigre's maxim either
    (you know I like Patria). But while the closed loop is indeed not \"pulling [the
    ampersand] away from anything else\", does it not matter at all that it's probably
    closest (I'm surmising), for the reader, to some abstract notion of \"what an
    ampersand looks like\" &ndash; and I'd think, a bit more crucially so than the
    issue of the \"g\"'s tail being closed or not?* So this open ampersand needs to
    overcome a (small) initial threshold of \"newness\" for the reader, no?\r\n\r\n*
    I agree that the design of type should be largely independent from ideas (ideals)
    of strokes and writing. But I'm not quite convinced that people (as in, normal
    end-users/readers) don't think of lettershapes, even when they're printed, in
    terms of \"how they'd write it\" &ndash; which would make a difference as to how
    they will perceive a non-chirographic shape. And in the open ampersand, you actually
    break the stroke (\"the thing they may think of as a stroke\") in half. Whereas
    in the \"g\" you basically only change the ending, which is less brutal to a chirographic
    \"reading\" of type, and therefore maybe less noticeable?\r\n\r\nThough of course
    the ampersand is probably the prime example of a glyph that's open to interpretation.
    And I'm not arguing against this open form, for the record. I see your points,
    and I actually quite like the shape. I'm just trying to see the pros and cons
    (in terms of functionality; of course there's always aesthetic considerations).
    \r\nFWIW, that ampersand from Script MT does seem to get pretty close to the limits
    of being identifiable as what it is, at least for me."

    agree with Nina. It's quite more similar to an Aleph than to an Ampersand (originally

    things tugging at a glyph are: belonging in a visual dictionary; and being decipherable.
    And while the former seems pretty literal/formal, the latter is pretty nebulous
    (meaning that deciphering a glyph involves recognizing enough hazy bits). So maybe
    something like that ampersand structure that I favor \"belongs\" very well while
    still exhibiting all the necessary hazy bits. But honestly I'm not pretending
    this is a highly robust argument with solid evidence; my stance derives in a large
    part from instinct: the closed binocular \"g\" and the old-fashioned ampersand
    simply seem pointlessly complex, alien.\r\n\r\n> I\u2019m not quite convinced

    honestly have to think that during immersive reading there's absolutely no room
    for a reader to consider the ease of writing of individual glyphs. Our reading
    system cannot be bothered by such irrelevances - it is like a hungry wild animal.\r\n\r\nAnd
    really, who ever writes like any font anyway! We don't reproduce serifs, stroke
    contrast, etc. Could we really be extracting and evaluating numerous \"skeletons\"
    in a fraction of a second at 10 point? Nevermind that 2/3-rds of the field of

    probably stuck in the skeleton model to some degree as far as character recognition
    goes (that \"abstract notion\" of what a given character \"looks like\"). But
    you make some excellent points! The model of a \"dictionary\" of somewhat fuzzy
    shapes that a (more often than not, also \"blurry\") glyph is matched up against,
    does seem a lot more plausible than anything involving abstract skeletons.\r\n\r\nBut,
    what is in the dictionary? Isn't that where the factor of familiarity comes in?
    \r\nI realize this might be splitting hairs, but with not a huge lot of open-topped
    ampersands around, I'd assume the reader might still have a tiny little threshold
    initially to \"amend the dictionary\", so to speak? (Though the ampersand is probably
    a bad example, since that particular dictionary entry is atypically broad and
    fuzzy anyway.)\r\n\r\nHope Marcelo doesn't mind this lil' tangent."

    (and especially as tightened closer with the most recent edits), that serif approximates
    an unseriffed, barely-open loop (like Baskerville's 'g'), which \"normalizes\"
    the open structure. An 's'-like serif will be truer to the rest of the font but
    I suspect might make the 'g' stand out too much. But I think it's worth a try.\r\n\r\n(How
