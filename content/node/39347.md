  Type 1 fonts to Opentype using the method Adam suggested in <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/37555\">this
  thread.</a> There\u2019s a problem with this method; widths all stay set to normal,
  and style names all stay set to regular. This means that in Indesign, no matter
  what I turn on, I only see the real normal weight.\r\n\r\nI have tried finding a
  setting that will allow me to automatically build the names in the preferences option
  but I don\u2019t see one. This brings up another problem: it seems like this option
  should be under the General section of the preferences; trying to access that menu
  crashes Fontlab but leaves it running (I can\u2019t even send a report to Apple).
  \r\n\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"
