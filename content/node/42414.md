body: "Some publishers take it upon themselves, when publishing texts in America previously
  published in the UK, to convert UK typography and style to American. This usually
  means swapping out single quotes for double quotes, \"favourites\" for \"favorites,\"
  and a host of other, more subtle substitutions (such as \"Philosopher's\" for \"Sorcerer's\").\r\n\r\nI'm
  wondering if anyone here is privy to how this conversion is done. I imagine it's
  done these days via a long, possibly scripted, find-and-replace protocol, but I'm
  curious to know the real answer. \r\n\r\n"

    could research the linguistic and lexicon conventions and do a grep search.  For
    example, All \"o\"s that follow a consonant and precede an \"r\" and replace them
    instance by instance. \r\n\r\nA checklist of things to look for would be great\u2014anyone
    have others to add to the list?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    stone everywhere. I'm betting advertising reasons.

  body: "It's called the philosopher's stone everywhere in the English-speaking world,
    including the US, so the changed title for the first book in the Harry Potter
    series has nothing to do with US-UK differences. It's just a marketing thing.
    Supposedly, the US publisher worried that a book with the word 'philosopher' in
    the title would not sell well. It's actually quite common for the same book to
    be published under different titles in the US and UK markets.\r\n\r\nThe UK-US
    conversion process could be automated to some degree, but someone versed in the
    stylistic differences really should go over the work manually. If you want the
    vocabulary differences to be addressed (opposite meanings of the word 'to table',
    for instance), there's no way to automate that. The changes made in the US version
    of the early Harry Potter books, such as replacing 'jumpers' with 'sweaters',
    were probably done by human editors just going through the whole text.\r\n\r\nThere
    are also slightly different conventions in mathematical notation, abbreviations,
    and the like. Grep searches will be helpful in those cases, I imagine."

  body: "There's an obligation to do things differently.\r\nJust because.\r\nIt always
    amused me that, working in an Ontario agency for a national client, we'd get English
    translated into French for the Quebec market--and even if our translator was from
    Quebec, because we were in Ontario, there'd often be someone, client side, in
    Quebec, who'd object to the language, and changes would have to be made.\r\n\r\nIf
    it's your job to look for mistakes, you'll find them.\r\nWho needs a watchdog
    that never catches anything?\r\n\r\nIMO, if you're a North American who likes
    the ambience of Harry Potter, replacing jumper with sweater is doing you a disservice--I
    mean, all those Brit movies that we manage to watch without subtitles. (With the
    exception of Trainspotting, IIRC, but that was a wee bit <em>braid.</em>)"

    it was a complete formating job from the author disks, rather than just a reformatting
    of the UK job.
