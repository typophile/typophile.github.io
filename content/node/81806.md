  dom casual for the players' names. I can emulate this via a distortion fairly easily
  but wanted to see if anyone had insight as to an official bold / wide version that
  matched. thanks!\r\n"

  body: It could be an "off" version of Dom. I have an old Lettergraphics catalog
    that shows a face called "Dom Bold" that looks very much like this (edges smoothed,
    lacking the hand-brushed quality), and doesn't match the typical digital version.
    It's the same proportions as the original, but stretched horizontally would be
    a close match, I think.

    match to whatever Dom is on the card that I've been able to find, and as Mark
    stated I can manipulate it to get close but I was seeking a wide/extrabold type
    version. This bold smooths out those edges most notably in the R where you get
    less of a stroke edge at connectors. \r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: "Once again, I think this lettering is from the large selection of film types
    available from the 60's through at least the 80's. I wouldn't be surprised to
    find a near match among the samples in the middle part of the Solotype Catalog,
    which I don't have with me right now. There were hundreds of brush drawn scripts
    in all combinations of weight and slant, as well as letterform styles from casual
    script to poster-style printing, with and without serifs. Dom Casual was one that
    made it into digital form early (was it metal first?), but there were many others.
    URW has digitized some of them, and so has Bitstream, and a trickle of others
    have been copied in other collections. This was obviously a trove of designs for
    type users in the pre-digital age.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
