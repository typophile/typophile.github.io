body: "I came across an intriguing comparison by William Chappell/Robert Bringhurst
  in <em>A Short History of the Printed Word</em>. Chappell (who is clearly the one
  speaking in this section, since he refers to watching Koch at work) says, \"It seems
  to me that the calligraphic forms of the Troy font fail to achieve the naturally
  organic characteristics of a rotunda, and instead only imitate models on which they
  were based\" (244). Below are examples, Troy (Morris) above and Wallau (Koch) below.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I see is this: the Troy looks like a simpler, wider, more \"modern\" face that's
  hiding behind some calligraphic embellishment. And I do see that the Wallau seems
  to be something like \"appropriate to itself\" in its form, especially, for example,
  in the narrowness and the occasional extra flourishes that make it seem more \"exotic.\"
  But that's from a very na&iuml;ve eye.\r\n\r\nCan some of you produce more concrete
  terms for distinguishing these two, in a way that explains the difference Chappell
  sees?\r\n\r\n- J\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type-comparison.jpg]"

  body: I wouldn't classify either of these types as rotunda. Morris' Troy type reminds
    me a lot of Schweynheim and Pannartz's Roman type. Like the contemporary Ashendene
    Press Subiaco type, based on S&P's first type, it is an attempt to capture something
    of the historical transition from blackletter to humanist type that took place
    in the first few years of printing in Italy. If you add to these two types the
    Doves Press roman, you have a kind of historical recreation, culminating in the
    Jensonian roman.

    damned if it's not just as you say-- loads of similarities. Chappell's book has
    been really helpful for me, but maybe he's forced this comparison. "

  body: "I'm not a big one for classification, but there are some apparent structural
    differences in the 2. See d, e, a . I think Morris was hoping to open up the design
    and make it more readable to an English-speaking audience, one not used to reading
    blackletter. Hence the more latinised shapes of d, a, w, etc. \r\n\r\nMorris'
    Troy was an effort to revive the look-and-feel of early printing in the machine
    age. Morris was interested in all the aspects of book arts, but was English and
    not known as a letterer. Koch was a calligrapher, a German one, who was thoroughly
    familiar with the various historical blackletter styles. Koch's various blackletter
    types derive directly from calligraphic styles, ones he practiced and read. The
    Troy type was a little like Morris' Golden type; a mimic intended to convey an
    archaic feel in books produced by Morris' workshop. In contrast, Koch not only
    practiced many blackletter hands, but cut a few types himself in addition to the
    ones Klingspor had cut from his designs. \r\n\r\nChappell (Warren, not William)
    says it himself, Troy \"imitates models on which it was based\". \r\n\r\nYou might
    say Morris was attempting to reproduce the superficial characteristics of early
    printing in his work. There is an element of kitsch or parody to his types. Koch
    knew the structure and history of the hands he based his types on, and was successful
    at translating those styles directly into printing types intended for his contemporaries. "
