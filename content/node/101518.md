  originally made the logo so I can't ask her what font she used :( We want to make
  personalised shirts using this, with our names on the back of the shirt, so we kind
  of really need the same font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/groovedexresize_5599.jpg]"

  body: I certainly wouldn't want to see MY name using only characters like that.
    The unaltered original, whether Eurostile or something similar, would seem much
    more appropriate.

  body: wow. yeah, that's... interesting. i hope you can fix the joins better than
