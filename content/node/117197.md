  that one of them is Trend sans. \r\n\r\nI know that he doesn't draw them entirely
  by hand. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/2f2e9e8165fec69ff24ddfd2ec595436_6288.jpg]"

    everything was hand-drawn. This time, assuming Trend Hand Made Ltt is for 'QUALITY'
    and 'GOODS', that let us:\r\n- 'ANNE & GLEN'/'NAVARRO': 3 /E, 4 /N, 2 /A and 2
    /R, all different so most probably hand-drawn\r\n- 'Far web': as usual close to

  body: "Two good finds Ryuk. _ANNE & GLEN_ and _NAVARRO_ are really close to Military
    Document -- almost a handwritten transcription modified to fit the logo format.
    Or a transcription of the original typewriter typeface that was used as the basis
    for Miltary Document. Geeoh as _Far Web_ is spot on. Note the edited _a_ and _b_.\r\nDon"
