    of thing. But some might have the illumination. Sample is really too small for
    my eyes :)\r\nI see they do use Akkurat (with Tiempos Headline) on their website
    so may be they simply re-worked it and borrowed /t and /r style from Akkurat Mono.
    But I know that's a very bad idea. To me, could resume it as Helvetica x DIN x
    Monospace /r and /t (but not /i?)."

  body: "Thanks Kevin and Akira. Funny thing is I thought about Milieu Grotesque yesterday
    but was before Kevin found a better sample. I built a quick reasoning based on
    clich\xE9s (architecture x design x Switzerland x Akkurat x Lineto x Sans x independent
    top notch foundry) and ended up checking 'Maison Neue' ('maison', French word
    for 'house')... but not 'Maison' (not Neue). Luckily for us, Akira's knowledge
    is far better than mine. "
