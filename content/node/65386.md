  my handwriting.  However, I'm not much happier with the readily available learn-at-home
  alternatives: italic or modern cursive.  They are legible, but that's about it.
  \ They reek practicality, without having elegance or sophistication or individuality.\r\n\r\nI
  am looking for a font to use as a model for my handwriting. My ideal would be something
  modern, distinctive, legible, fairly easy to write quickly and arresting or \"cool\"
  (whatever that means when applied to handwriting).  A lot to ask, I know.\r\n\r\nI
  would so appreciate any suggestions.  Thank you in advance for your help.\r\n\r\nNick"

    Which can look cool, but would also be decidedly mannered, even affected. Most

    The most you should want to change it might be to make it more legible. And there's
    one very easy way to do that: slow down.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    font, i.e. something based on a handwriting model that you could, in turn, adapt
    as a model for your own writing. Caflisch Script Pro might be a good candidate:
    it is a model that is easy both to write and to read, you can be quite free in
    how many joins you make or do not make between letters, and it does not depend
    on the use of a particular writing implement."

    \r\n\r\nThis may or may not help you: \r\n\r\nMany people have noticed my handwriting
    is distinctive. I'm asked to address special envelopes and such. \r\n\r\nMy handwriting
    started to become distinctive after I took art school classes in Lettering 101.
    We first learned a basic upright style using a broad-nibbed pen. \r\n\r\nI stopped
    writing in the slanted, cursive style I was taught in 3rd grade (Palmer?). To
    me, that seems to result in sloppiness, with the letters all too often running
    together and resembling each other (m-n-w-i-e). \r\n\r\nI started writing habitually
    in an upright, unconnected style, with each letter formed separately, with a 2-story
    \"a,\" and large capitals. When written hurriedly, the letterforms are more dramatic.

    but these are all fairly slow and calculated, but I thought I could in some way
    work backwards from those to create a faster, instinctive handwriting, and around
    that time I happened to find the Rosemary Sassoon book.\r\n\r\nI retrain my handwriting
    partly when things start to go wrong with it, such as r & v looking too similar,
    and bad spacing on cl so it looks like d, and while I'm doing that I might change
    the way I write some other letters. I also write differently depending on the
    pen I'm using. I do the traditional italic slant with fine pointed nibs but do
    an upright version with wider nibs, or even slant to the left with something very
    wide like a Pilot Parallel pen.\r\n\r\n"
