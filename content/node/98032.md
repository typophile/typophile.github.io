body: "Just in case anyone\u2019s interested, I got a phone call from my brother Jim
  on Saturday, informing me that my favorite nephew\u2014a bright, gifted but troubled
  soul\u2014 committed suicide the night before. Evidently, he simply didn\u2019t
  want to go on living in this f*cked-up world. OTOH, with the serial idiocy posted
  by <strong>quadibloc</strong> and <strong>5star</strong> in the \u201CWho is Luc\u2026\u201D
  thread, I can\u2019t say as I blame him.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, over the course of ten days
  in late June to early July, I put together some thoughts on the current FUBAR state
  of the world, how we got here, and how we can move on\u2014IMHO, of course. Well,
  I think that it's time to publish it as a eBook. The source file is currently a
  Word document; however, I probably ought to set it up in INDD\u2014I really dislike
  Word's solution to vertical justification. You can find the first chapter here\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nicksfonts.com/depot/The_Killing_of_the_Fly.pdf\r\n\r\n...which
  you may or may not be able to download; despite the fact that I have confirmed that
  the file exists on my server, neither Firefox nor Internet Explorer can locate it
  as I type. Perhaps it\u2019s an indexing problem, which will correct itself soon.\u2026or
  not, with the way my luck has been going lately.\r\n\r\nRight now, it\u2019s set
  up in Georgia, which I personally find to be warm, inviting and easy to read\u2014at
  least, to my tired old eyes. Plus, it's semi-ubiquitous across platforms\u2014which
  ought to mean that Acrobat could simply embed the font as it is; instead, this single
  chapter has around 50 subsetted TTFs in it. Really? See FILE &gt; PROPERTIES &gt;
  FONTS. Anyhow, given the subject matter or just on a whim, could anyone suggest
  a more suitable typeface?\r\n\r\nOh. And forgive me if I seem a bit out of sorts.
  I think that I am at the Anger stage of dealing with my loss, so I might be a bit
  peckish\u2026sorry if I have offended anyone."

  body: "<cite>Does INDD CS3 have the tools for generating the different versions?</cite>\r\n\r\nAh,
    no. But in your particular case, if you're not planning a print version anyway...\r\n\r\nI
    threw in the stuff about the changes to InDesign to show a certain legitimacy,
    a seriousness of the PDF product, not as something you need to have. Obviously,
    PDF has been available all along, but always came with too-large margins for most
    digital readers, and (usually) a need to scroll on the page too often.\r\n\r\nIn
    general:\r\n\r\nUnless there are a lot of images, tables, etc., it's not particularly
    hard to just do two versions by hand. I can usually take a book of scholarly-monograph-level
    complexity (subheads, extracts, lists, etc.) & \"redesign\" and reset it in about
    four hours. That includes changing the typeface to a worked-over OpenSource set
    of fonts to avoid licensing issues where I don't know just what my customer might
    do. It does NOT include fixing an index. To keep page-for-page while changing
    the margins is doable, but does require planing ahead, and some small compromises.\r\n\r\nI've
    done a coupe of these as books to test out the notion, but it isn't something
    we do for customers yet, because all they want these days is EPUB format. Marketing
    considerations always trump design issues, don't you know.\r\n\r\nProbably neither
    of us will live long enough to see the end of the device wars, and as long as
    device is a significant part of marketing, I don't think PDF is going to be a
    primary format. I mean, if something will run on anybody's reader, what's the
    point? (\"It isn't done until Lotus 1-2-3 won run!\")\r\n\r\nI do believe though,
    that there will come a time when the digital editions are *designed* and *typeset*
    just like print editions. And just like print, the (human) reader won't be able
    to change the typeface or spatial relationships."

    are increasingly unwilling -in essence unable- to submit to other people's expertise,
    and this includes [not] changing the font.\r\n\r\nA notable detail here is that
    people typically choose a font size that's too large for comfortable extended
    reading. This has been empirically shown, and it makes perfect sense to anybody
    who has an appreciation of text/unconscious typography as opposed to mere display/conscious

    This is how the system works best--when customers choose. And how does the system

    (Kindle Format 8, or azw3) and EPUB allow publishers to embed fonts in their ebooks.
    But I'd second the comment from ldavidson that embedded fonts don't always look
    good, especially when using e-ink readers. For example, Random House embedded
    Georgia in the Kindle version of John Grisham's latest book, The Racketeer. You'd
    think this font would look good on an e-reader, especially the Kindle Paperwhite,
    which has higher pixel density than most other e-ink readers. But it looks a bit
    off -- the thin parts of the glyphs seem too thin, at least to my eyes. Meanwhile,
    the built-in fonts, Palatino and Baskerville, for example, look much better, because
    these particular versions have been optimized for the device. (The Racketeer looks
    fine with Georgia on an iPad 3, however, because of the higher pixel density,
    I suppose.)\r\n\r\nSome publishers are having trouble formatting their ebooks
    in KF8, particularly when migrating the file from a word processor like MSFT Word
    through the KindleGen software. Apparently Word leaves specific font size and
    typeface encoding in the file that can make it impossible for the user to select
    one of the built-in fonts. These problems can also mess up the font sizes. So
    if you're considering formatting your ebook in KF8, here's a link to a <a href=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/community/thread.jspa?threadID=69096&tstart=90\">forum
    thread</a> with an explanation of how to avoid these problems (see the post from
    mrlasers on Nov 7).\r\n\r\nBTW, I was recently reading Matthew Butterick's description
    of his <a href=\"http://www.typographyforlawyers.com/?page_id=3047\">Equity typeface</a>,
    and it occurred to me that it might work well on an e-ink reader. I licensed Equity
    and used Calibre to embed it in a KF8 sample. I think it works well, and I prefer
    it to the built-in Baskerville and Palatino fonts. I realize Matthew wasn't thinking
    about e-ink readers when he designed Equity, and some typographers might advise
    against using a condensed face for long-form reading, but I think it's cool that
    it works so well, at least to my eyes."
