		<div class="commentbody">Aw. Disappointed by Fast Company&#39;s new cover. I found the last flag incredibly endearing. The compartmentalized cover with the red/black/mustard/cyan color combination makes my stomach queasy. <BR> <BR>Inside, now it&#39;s pretty much Standard-Issue Magazine Layouts with no Storm at all, which was what I liked best. Now seems corporate and robotic. <BR> <BR>they refer readers here: <BR><A HREF="http://www.fastcompany.com/keyword/redesign62" TARGET="_top">http://www.fastcompany.com/keyword/redesign62</A> <BR> <BR>Business 2.0 also changed some things. Mimi Dutta, the new creative director, is a little more creative with her feature heds. And she likes DOTS a lot. ...  <BR> <BR>Mac Addict did a redesign three or four issues ago. There&#39;s a face inside that I can&#39;t seem to figure out. I&#39;ll get a scan up during the week. <BR> <BR>As far as throwing magazines out...I have a pack-rat collection of magazines dating back about 10 years. Nobody understands why I keep them, including myself....I just can&#39;t read a magazine and &#42;throw it away!&#42; <BR> <BR>bj</div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Fernando Guti&eacute;rrez is a Pentagram Partner and the creative director of COLORS nowadays - he studied at LCP in the early 80&#39;s - apart from COLORS &amp; MATADOR - he just did a Phaidon photo book on Gandhi - he is in my book one of the finest graphic designers of the classic mould working today. <BR> <BR>Now with that said i am a big fan of his stark approach at COLORS which i think is the right response to the content and the line of photography they accomodate <BR> <BR>His work is much more lively at MATADOR where he reaches astonishing expression from so few means &#40;one typeface, often subtle and consistent colors and blinding work in proportions&#41; </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> i&#39;m glad to see this discussion because i publish a small &#40;in circulation, not paper size&#41; print electronic music magazine and since my volunteer art director left, i have to design the mag myself.  <BR> <BR>just to detail my experiences as a non-designer by trade, i can say i have the following problems: <BR> <BR>1&#41; i have to work in black&amp;white &#40;can&#39;t afford color&#41; <BR> <BR>2&#41; image quality of photos i receive are of a wide range of quality, from very good to horrible. <BR> <BR>3&#41; i can&#39;t afford any design help. <BR> <BR>within these constraints, i&#39;d love to get some suggestions on how to work. it seems to me that if you get great images to begin with, that helps make a good look for a magazine already.  <BR> <BR>i am currently planning on using a new font, Sys, for the text and a futuristic-looking font--House Spaceport 3009 for heads. one problem i am having is trying to create some kind of &#34;header&#34; for our different sections of reviews that meshes well with the rest of the page. perhaps i can put together a couple of PDFs when i get home for some input. is there a way to upload to this site? <BR> <BR>thanks, sean portnoy <BR>grooves magazine--experimental electronic music magazine <BR>groovesmag.com </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Sean, as you mentioned quality photography is key, as  <BR>is quality type. <BR> <BR>My strongest suggestion is to find another volunteer  <BR>designer. Students eager to get real press experience  <BR>may be a great place to start. <BR> <BR>When you&#39;re ready to post samples, please start a new  <BR>thread in Critique &#62; Typography/Composition.

		<div class="commentbody"> The use of a weight axis &#40;internally if not in the released font&#41; which has become de rigueur since the increase in sophistication of font editors encourages uniformity in style between the various weights. This has certain advantages, but suffers from the classic flaw of Modernism: lack of contrast; which just happens to be what a Bold is intended for... In contrast &#40;so to speak&#41; Carter explains how he &#34;diverged&#34; the darkest weights of Galliard, giving them a singular life. I have a copy of an old article that he wrote about the development of Galliard, but I can&#39;t remember where it was from... <BR> <BR>BTW, this is somewhat parallel to the fact that the copy-paste &#40;which became so easy to do with computers&#42;&#41; also encourages uniformity/Modernism, but on a more local level. <BR> <BR>&#42; There was actually a primitive form of copy-paste even in the foundry days: punchcutters used the same counterpuch to make similar parts of different letters, like the counters of &#34;n&#34; and &#34;h&#34;.

Maybe you&#39;re referring to a different one. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s funny you should mention Galliard in this context, however, because I recently had a very long and encouraging conversation with Mike Parker about the heavier weights of Whitman and we specifically discussed Matthew&#39;s process with Galliard. <BR> <BR>As for how &#34;divergent&#34; my work will be, we&#39;ll just have to wait and see. <BR> <BR>Tiffany, I hadn&#39;t really considered condensed versions &#40;not being too big on condensed faces myself&#41;.

		<div class="commentbody"> Yes it does!  :-&#41; <BR>MasLucida &#40;a set of structures, not a font&#41; was based on Lucida because Lucida has very &#34;elemental&#34; letterforms, so they didn&#39;t need much change in order to look like &#42;structures&#42;, like I wanted. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the only one who thinks that a &#42;usable&#42; font must not look so &#34;structural&#34;. By the way, on the way from Lucida to MasLucida I incorporated certain &#34;phase one&#34; changes to Lucida, in order to make it more bookish, and as a result facilitate a comparison to MasLucida&#39; intentions. Besides increasing the extenders and tightening the spacing &#40;I &#42;think&#42; - it&#39;s been a while&#41;, I added a bicameral &#34;g&#34;: it wasn&#39;t easy to get it to feel right, but except for a slightly large head that needs to be scaled smaller to the left, I think it provides for a better solution than the original mono &#34;g&#34;. <BR> <BR>Maybe one thing that bugs me is the scope of the Lucida megafamily: it really seems too strict, formally speaking. Some of the constituent fonts look like they&#39;ve been inbred just a &#42;bit&#42; too closely to become healthy adults... <BR> <BR>hhp </div>
