body: "As the subject says, I'm having trouble identifying the font attached (see
  below). Sorry for the picture quality. I had poor lighting and it was a capture
  with my phone out of an article.\r\n\r\nIt's similar to the Consolas typeface, but
  has different notable features in the lowercase \"l\" and spacing between the legs
  of the lowercase \"m\".\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\n"
