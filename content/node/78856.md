body: "I am in the early stages of developing a chromatic face that, by design, employs
  a lot of slight diagonals (1 to 5 degrees off the horizontal or vertical). The glyphs
  are made to look as if they were formed by folding strips of paper (I know, I know
  it's been done before). In addition to the pair of companion chromatic fonts within
  the family (each representing a different side of the strip of paper), I want to
  make a monotone version that somehow achieves the 2-sided effect without the use
  of multiple colors.\r\n\r\nThe solution I've arrived at to simulate that 2-sided
  effect is to, in the areas representing the back of the strip of paper, block or
  mask out strokes that run parallel with the strip. The problem I've encountered
  in testing the viability of this solution is that the edges of the strokes (set
  at the aforementioned slight diagonal angles), as well as the edges of some of the
  solid sections, appear quite \"jaggy\" when I test the PS OpenType font in Illustrator
  or InDesign.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe curious thing, to me, is that those same slight
  diagonal edges appear comparatively less jaggy in the Glyph Window within FLS5 and
  when the two test letters are typeset in TextEdit. However, when printed the jagginess
  of those edges is observed in outputs from both Illustrator and TextEdit.\r\n\r\nAre
  there any settings, tricks, preferences in FontLab that can remedy this or is this
  issue just to be expected when working with slight angled contours and unfixable?\r\n\r\nA
  PDF with multiple screenshots is attached to better illustrate my quandary. It is
  best viewed at 100%, so as to get a more accurate sense of the problem. A brief
  rundown of my system and process is included at the bottom of the document. \r\n\r\nThank
  You,\r\nAndy[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Example_3543.png]"

  body: "It's all just on the screen.\r\n\r\nApparently, all of these programs use
    different anti-aliasing techniques. There is no monitor sharp enough to draw a
    slightly slanted line without jaggies, and it only depends on the drawing algorithm
    how bad they are.\r\n\r\n<cite>However, when printed the jagginess of those edges
    is observed in outputs from both Illustrator and TextEdit.</cite>\r\n\r\nHow much
    dpi? 300? 600? Inkjet, laser? Offset printing?\r\n\r\nIf it really bothers you
    (as in \"I want to have it look good, even on a 50 dpi '90s VGA monitor\"), make
    the lines perfectly perpendicular to the horizontals and/or verticals, and hope
    no-one rotates your font."
