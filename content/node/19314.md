body: "Greetings: I'm looking for type suggestions for a variety of projects. I perform
  desktop publishing for local Virginia businesses, Clients including a realtor, developer,
  builder, photographer, equine non-profit, and others. I write/design ads and promos
  that appear in local papers and weekly publications (newsprint); as well as newsletters;
  flyers; brochures; and business cards/letterhead.\r\nBack in the dinosaur days when
  we purchased type on floppy disks, I had TONS of Adobe stuff, but found I generally
  used three or four faces regularly.  Now, after a long hiatus from this type of
  work, my floppy versions are gone, and I'd like to purchase some new type.\r\nAs
  much as I try to \"expand\" my tastes, I usually choose type with the same characteristics:
  large x-height and tight letter spacing. Also, I often like condensed versions in
  headers. Lately, my type of choice has been ITC Century Std, in the past it has
  been Garamond. I like Utopia, but have never tried it. \"Regulars\" include Bookman
  and Palatino, and for sans serif, Helvetica (although I never like the way it looks;
  I got used to it when I worked for a corp. that used it as their official typeface).
  As you can see, my choices are all pretty mainstream. \r\nThese days, I'm looking
  to find about half a dozen typefaces that work together in a variety of print materials.
  \ I'd like to try something new, fresh, more modern, that will work with/compliment
  the style I like (and will continue to use, no doubt) and I'd hope to find a sans
  serif, as well as something more casual. Please, any creative suggestions for a
  collection of type would be greatly appreciated!  I'm hoping you'll all get me to
  think outside the box a bit..."

  body: 'Claire: What a surprise... Greetings to you my friend. Not sure after so
    many years that I am capable of accurately predicting your present tastes. Perhaps
    you could send along some further clues of likes and dislikes so that I may make
    a better suggestion.... As you know I''m an architect, so I prefer, and continue
    to use, a more relaxed typeface that allows for a little flexibility in interpretation.
    Feel free to contact me directly at architeradesign@yahoo.com if you wish. Hans'

  body: "Claire,\r\n\r\nI am a graphic design student in Leesburg Va, about to graduate
    this fall. I can tell you that some of the favorites around campus among designers
    are: Helvetica Neue LT Std \u2014lots of typeface choices and glyphs, Century
    Gothic, Avenir, a new favorite of mine currently is Hypatia Sans Pro.\r\n\r\nJust
    today, I ordered a copy of Vetren from http://www.fonteaminternational.com/fonthome.html.
    I needed a casual looking sans serif.\r\n\r\nFor what it is worth, I often reach
    back in time and pull out Bodoni, Goudy Old Style, and Weiss for contrast.\r\n\r\nHope
    this is helpful. Let me know if you come across a sans serif that you are particulary
    attracted to. I recently worked on an annual report for a marine related hardware
    corporation and set body copy in  Apollo MT. It worked out great\u2014at least
    I was pleased with the result. Good luck.\r\n\r\nSam"
