  is only as an aid to track down the font. \r\nI've tried What The Font, and so far,
  no results.  It seemingly cannot place the \"L\".\r\n\r\nOf course, any help would
  be most appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

    and I never paused to look.\r\nOh, and the letters are marine quality vinyl. They
    are a LITTLE better than paint. "
