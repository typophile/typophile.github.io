body: Hey everyone! Are their any companies out there that give out free stuff if
  requested? I&#39;m looking for several things like paper swatch books, news letters
  relating to design and/or typography and type specimens. I&#39;m currently unemployed
  which can be both good and bad for me. <BR>Good because I have alot of time to work
  on my design and type projects. Bad because I can only afford the bare essentials
  and can&#39;t buy any books, magazine or any info relating to design, which we all
  know can be expensive. I would really appreciate the help. <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>Ivan
