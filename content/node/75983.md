  body: "can't quite place the font but the duplicate letters match up to well to
    be hand drawn in my opinion. i would say its been manually edited though... \r\nI
    would even consider numerous fonts being used. For example the N, A, I, and S
    match up to times new roman... \r\n\r\nBut the Rest seem to be different \r\n\r\nThe
    R looks sort of like Aviano Squooshed... (dont quote me on that) "
