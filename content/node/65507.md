body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bm_logo_6427.png]\r\nBold Monday is an
  independent font foundry established by Paul van der Laan & Pieter van Rosmalen
  and based in The Hague, The Netherlands. It regards itself as the typographical
  equivalent of a so called \"indie\" record company where a DIY mentality and artistic
  freedom are the highest values. The Bold Monday collection is therefore diverse
  and reflects the personal fascinations from its designers."
