  body: Whatever it is, it is quite amateurish. The letter forms and certainly their

  body: "It has some resemblance to Ray Larabie's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/credit/|Credit
    Valley]], but I searched his other fonts without finding this one. Also checked
    Freebies at Dafont, but no luck there. I also checked my Serif Guide, but it wasn't
    anything I have collected.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
