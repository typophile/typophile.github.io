  body: I noticed this page in our referrer logs and thought I'd add a correction.  The
    logo actually uses a font called Hefty Regular.  Hellenic Wide and Zapata are
    very close -- Hefty Regular is probably based on one or the other.

  body: Hefty Regular is indeed based on Hellenic Wide. THX for dropping by. ;^)
