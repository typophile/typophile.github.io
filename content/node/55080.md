  namemark for a new business adventure. I wanted to see a little space between the
  \"Mc\" and the \"Fann\" although I don't know of any typographic precedent for it.
  \ So I moved the \"c\" closer to the \"M\", and the \"F\" further away from the
  \"c\".  Does it look OK?  Or does it look like just the goofy sort of thing that
  a newbie would do?  And what about the rest of the spacing?\r\n\r\nThe font is Big
  Caslon at 36pt.  For the web, should I use instead a font that doesn't have such
  fine hairlines.  Like maybe a text font even though I wouldn't use it at 36pt in
  print?\r\n\r\nHere is what it looks like at 48 pt.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brianmcfann_48pt_5505.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBrian"

  body: 'Why not try spacing the whole name just a little bit looser? Looser letterspacing
    is common for uppercase letterforms, and you might decide you don''t need the
    extra space after <strong>Mc</strong>. Don''t increase the space between <strong>F</strong>
    and <strong>a</strong>, though; that''s about as loose as you want to get. '

  body: "Thanks for the suggestion, PublishingMojo. I will try it.\r\n\r\nAssuming
    that the MacArthur Foundation can afford to hire an experienced typographer, their
    namemark might be a good model:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo2_4950.gif]\r\n\r\nSo,
    with that model in mind, here is my namemark with more spacing and more-or-less
    evenly spaced:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brianmcfann2_5914.gif]\r\n\r\nAnd
    here it is with a little space after the prefix in an attempt to give it a little
    style:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brianmcfann3_3491.gif]\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think?\r\n"

    like the too obvious stroke contrast between UC an LC. Because they more look

    first image old and second new? or are they two new iterations? I'll comment on
    the second (thinking it's a new one)... Still Kerning problems. Turn it upside
    down to see... B still a bit to close to R. And probably M to C as well... Should
    there be space between Mc and Fann? should it be like Mc Fann or McFann?\r\n\r\nBut
    since you letterspaced it a bit more than before it doesn't look as if you'd be
    using fake sc's... ;)\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
