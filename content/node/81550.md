  body: "It could all be the same font. I went back and looked at the <A href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\">Serif
    Font ID Guide</a> and came up with a couple of candidates that seem pretty close,
    but it's hard to be sure either is a true match, because the details are hard
    to see in the smaller letters: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/milo-serif/\">Milo
    Serif</a> and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/comenia-serif-pro/\">Comenia
    Serif</a> are pretty close to my eyes, and match better than Amasis, I think.
    The one feature that makes me unsure is the upper counter of the g seems rounder
    in your sample than in the fonts I am suggesting.\r\n\r\nIf you have a clearer
    image, or more letters, perhaps you can use the Serif Guide and find a better
    choice.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    too unlikely (expensive). Maybe I was too quick. Akira you're usually right.\r\n\r\n-
