  gradient typeface here is something I am curious about - love the numerals - it
  is not far away from MVB Solano (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/solano-gothic-mvb/)
  - but not quite...\r\n\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nYour time and knowledge is, as always,
  much appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt"

    Extra Condensed for anyone interested - one of those 'should have thought of that
