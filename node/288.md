  body: ' thanks for the link! I was thrown by the site design at first. whether it&#39;s
    in-progress or intentionally old-school in it&#39;s approach, it works very well
    as is. <BR> <BR>the type is quite nice. the low-tech revivals are done with a
    lot of personal style &#40;the site design makes infinitely more sense once you
    see their fonts&#41;. I&#39;m not quite sure about their &#42;text&#42; label.
    I suppose text might be acceptable nomenclature in web terms, but I&#39;m not
    going to be using them anytime soon for any of my upcoming book jobs! '
