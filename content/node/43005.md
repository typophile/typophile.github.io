  body: "Amerigroup looks quite similar to a font called [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_c/charlotte_lhf_full.gif|'LHF
    Charlotte']] by Denise Bayers. The serifs are quite small and don't show up well
    in this image from my [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]]. I cannot find this font at Letterhead Fonts anymore, but I had
    the design date for this as 2002. One of Bayers' fonts is still sold there and
    she may know more about this font. It's possible the Amerigroup lettering was
    a custom version of the same lettering, because the U appears narrower in the
    logo, and it's possible the serifs were also modified for the logo. The letter
    shapes still seem quite similar, including the open P.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
