body: "Hello,\r\nI'm designing a flyer for an event of our game club. However, the
  guy that created the logo could not be reached for the last week or so and it's
  getting urgent. Could anyone help me identify the font he used?\r\n\r\nThe font
  first appears in the logo in 2008. I got a few close fonts by looking for \"army
  stencil\" and \"stamp\" fonts but no exact (or good enough) match. The capital 'S'
  in particular is kind of a weird shape which I didn't find back.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thunderboltsfont_6521.png]"
