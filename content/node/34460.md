body: I just snagged a couple of tickets to "Helvetica" at this year's Silverdocs,
  the big documentary film festival in Silver Spring, Maryland (suburban Washington
  DC).  Helvetica could be the sleeper hit of the festival--they have already added
  several screenings "by popular demand"(the festival ends Sunday June 17).  Tickets
  still available for the Saturday and Sunday showings...This is so exciting--I understand
  Director Gary Hustwit gives Typophile gets a credit!  More at silverdocs.com.
