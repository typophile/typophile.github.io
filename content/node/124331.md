  body: "Good suggestions Kevin.\r\nIt's interesting to note that this is not a real
    cereal box, but rather it's a movie prop from Independent Studio Services http://issprops.com/graphics/products/category/cereal_boxes/P18\r\nNote
    that package -- color palate, raisins mixed with the bran, lettering style etc.
    --  is a rip of Post Raisin Bran [img:sites/default/files/old-images/PostRaisinBran_5493.jpg]
    The only significant difference in the lettering is the leg on _R_.\r\nIf Post
    has a font that matches it's label it would essentially match your request.\r\nDon"
