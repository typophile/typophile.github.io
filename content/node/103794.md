  body: "I suspect this is something created as a private font to reinforce the product
    image of the publishers line of romance novels.\r\nThe terminals for both fonts
    are some sort of a swoosh design -- perhaps to suggest romance. The angled font
    seems to be a tweeked version of the top font. \r\nSome of the ideas found in
    the font date back to 19th century designs.\r\nNote the R with a sharp angled
    shoulder on the leg. This is found in at least one readily available font, <a
    href=\" http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-tiffany/heavy/glyphs.html\">ITC
    Tiffany Heavy</a> designed by Edward Benguiat in 1974 based in part on Ronaldson,
    a very popular 19th century font with huge serifs on the arms. Canada Type has
    revived <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/\">Ronaldson</a>,
    cut by Alexander Kay for MacKellar in 1884 and designed by Rebecca Alaccari in
    2008.\r\nThe huge serifs on L & E in your image could have been adapted from the
    Ronaldson/Tiffany design by making the serif alignment more vertical and clipping
    off the spurs protuding below the baseline and above the caps height.\r\nDon\r\n"
