  body: No, fair point, but I need to change the title to something else, and I'm
    not sure how to do an S and a C in the same style. Just thought it would save
    some time if I could find the face or at least a similar one.

  body: You could maybe use Font Bureau's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/skyline/">Skyline</a>
    (or maybe GroupType's half-price-version <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/corvinus-skyline/">Corvinus
    Skyline</a>)  that share some similarities with the one in your sample...

  body: "Niagara and skyline seem to be the closest, but they don't really help me
    too much with the S as their bezier construction is completely different (take
    a look at the R in TATLER) Thanks anyway guys.\r\n\r\nBTW love your avatar Martin.
    What's the name for the type of graphic that reads the same upside-down?"
