  appeared elsewhere. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone recognize any of them, or can you think
  of any existing logos that may look/feel similar?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nByron"

    clinic which I can't place.\r\n\r\nSeveral do vaguely remind me of different things,
    but nothing specific. Why do you ask?\r\n\r\nYou might look around on <a href=\"http://logopond.com/\">Logopond</a>
    as well."

  body: "I was just trying to help out.  The folks at DataPortability.org were trying
    to vet their logo candidates in order to avoid a potential case of trademark infringement.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    that's precisely what happened.  The logo that was selected (#3, 1st row) looks
    a bit too much like the Zaoza logo.  It's really too bad:  http://zaoza.com/\r\n\r\nThey
    are probably going to look at a secondary candidates from this list, so if anyone
    has any other specific ideas about possible trademark infringements, any help
    would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
