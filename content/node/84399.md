  app called METERMINDER. The logo is displayed in my profile for now. MM will remind
  users to move their cars before they get a parking ticket. \r\n\r\nI've attached
  a sample parking sticker here \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MM_Scan28_Single_3703.jpg]\r\n\r\nPlease
  let me know if you cannot view the entire image or need additional images that would
  help us determine what fonts are used on the sticker. \r\n\r\nYour thoughtful feedback
  is appreciated,\r\nIV "
