    something to keep them busy, because they sure as hell aren\u2019t devoting time
    to accurately representing the contributions women made to art in the twentieth
    century.</a> "

  body: "This is mostly for the sake of conversation, but\u2026 I wonder what the
    implications are of the following statement from the announcement:\r\n\r\n<cite>We
    have acquired the design act in itself and as we will feature it in different
    typefaces, we will note each time the specific typeface as if we were indicating
    the materials that a physical object is made of.</cite>\r\n\r\nFor instance, I've
    seen some EULAs that explicitly forbid using the font to create work whose primary
    function is reliant on that specific typeface (e.g. alphabet stamps, monograms,
    sometimes even logotypes are forbidden). I did a bit of pondering on the topic
    in relation to the series of <a href=http://blog.myfonts.com/83>glyph t-shirts</a>
    I designed for MyFonts a while ago.\r\n\r\nI rather doubt that many type producers
    would complain if the MoMA were to highlight their typeface with full credits,
    but I'm curious about what people think of the comparison between typefaces and
    other more traditional materials, like oil paint or charcoal."

  body: What disappoints me about this whole thing, particularly this idea of labeling
    typefaces "as if we were indicating the materials that a physical object is made
    of", is the missed opportunity to talk about typefaces themselves as having been
    designed.

  body: "<em>We have acquired the design act in itself...</em>\r\n\r\nAFAIK, a fellow
    called named Tomlinson was responsible for the conceptualization (\"design act\")
    of the @ symbol (applying the old @ symbol to email addresses), so I don't see
    how MoMA can acquire it from him, except by unilateral declaration of annexation.\r\n\r\nIt
    is the act of curation, not initial creation, that the MoMA curator is appropriating
    as her own, a power-play for herself and her profession,  claiming centre stage
    for the latest reiteration of the tired old discourse, \"But is it art?\""

  body: "OK, I hadn't read that.\r\nBut MOMA's recognition of him doesn't alter my
    contention that MoMA cannot \"acquire\" his repurposing.\r\nUnless one agrees
    with its claim that it's theirs because they said so.\r\n\r\nMOMA is recognizing
    his concept, and cannot own or acquire it.\r\nIt's Tomlinson's, and he hasn't
    sold it to MOMA.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not going to engage in this futile discussion
    any more, because that's the game that the curator is playing, which validates
    her position, which is meaningless and banal IMHO.\r\n"

    think it's unlikely that any featured typeface designer will object to seeing
    their @ cast in carbon fiber, concrete or plutonium. But you know they're going
    to pick totally uninspired set of fonts to reflect the mundane and utilitarian
    nature of the mark. If they don't pick Helvetica and Lucida Grande I'll be shocked.
