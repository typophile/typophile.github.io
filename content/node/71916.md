  far I did only all upper and lowercase + \".\"\r\nStill without proper metrics done.\r\n\r\nI'd
  call this rather only preview to decide whether is it worth to continue or not.\r\n\r\nAny
  comments on this?\r\n\r\n- Dusan\r\n\r\nP.S. - Don't pay attention on proportions
  if it's possible, it's still far from good.\r\n\r\nP.S. 2 - I still have a couple
  of doubts about some shapes... for example with /S/ and /s/, should they have \"eaten\"
  part of to be without it... and so on."

    me: the vertical placement of the middle arm of the <em>E</em> and the width of
    the bottom of <em>V</em> feels like it's too much.\r\n\r\nNice work! Looking forward
    to seeing it finished!"

  body: There's something of an optical illusion that makes the right part of the
    crossbars in f and t appear to sit lower than the left part. It might help if
    you raised them a little to compensate.

    played a little with serifs.\r\n\r\nI'm not so confident that this can be useful
    variation (with serif)."

    for slab, or, better yet try something lighter, which complements the traps."

  body: Looking at it more, I think the way you've used the notch gimmick in f, t,
    and T can only be a hindrance to reading, no matter how you tweak it. Instead,
    you should try a horizontal notch underscoring the crossbar.

    here are new updates.\r\n\r\nI made a couple of alternative glyphs for /E/, /F/,
    /f/, /t/, /K/, /k/ and /Z/, just to have them all in one place and maybe easier
    decide with which one to go.\r\n\r\nI also did what Kevin suggested with middle
    part of /f/ and /t/.\r\n\r\nP.S. - PDF from the first post is updated also."
