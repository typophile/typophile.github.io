body: "Greetings All,\r\n\r\nI'm a software developer that's created a clock app that
  lets users upload digital clock designs and share them with others.  In the app,
  the designs are pulled from the web and the clock representation changes periodically
  to give you something interesting to look at.  As typography professionals and enthusiasts,
  I thought some of you may appreciate seeing numerals rendered in different styles,
  and maybe even have an idea for a design of your own.  Currently the app is available
  for iOS devices (iPhone/iPod/iPad), and I am giving it away free for a while.\r\n\r\nIf
  you are interested in checking it out, you can learn more here:\r\n[[https://www.clockton.com]]\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone has any feedback on the overall look and feel of the app, I would be happy
  to hear your thoughts!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nEvan\r\n\r\n\r\np.s.  I am also running
  a clock design competition on 99designs right now.  If you think you have an award-winning
  design, you might want to consider submitting it.\r\n[[http://99designs.com/other-art-illustration/contests/create-digital-clock-clockton-199820]]"

    <em>how</em> it is to show it.\r\n\r\nHere is something I made for my Windows
    computer desktop. It shows me the date and day of the week as well as the time,
    and it uses an \"odometer\" animation for the minutes.\r\n\r\nI do not intend
    this as an entry into your contest, of course, as it is not only too small (not
    nearly enough pixels), but also much too amateurish. I just want to show you what
    is possible. This is my solution to a problem of \"minutes are too coarse; seconds
    are too anal-retentive\". [img:sites/default/files/old-images/clock-demo_3684.png]"
