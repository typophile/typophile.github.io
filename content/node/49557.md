  body: "hi bald,\r\navenir and gotham are really similar (into the word \"Bloomsberg\").\r\nI'm
    italian student, pretty new for graphic design. So can you explain me why you
    can see this font is gotham and not avenir?\r\nthank you really much in advance
    \r\nsorry if this question seems stupid. And my english too  ;)\r\n\r\nt"

  body: Apologies for the late response to this thread. I do believe that it is Avenir
    Heavy. As Tommi asked, it is difficult to distinguish the difference between Avenir
    Heavy and H&FJ Gotham. Perhaps the 'ascenders' are quite tall, yet the 'x-height'
    is quite low (check that out, I've just been reading The Encyclopaedia of Fonts,
    yo).

  body: Hi Tommi, you're correct -- it's Avenir. I didn't see your comment before
    I posted mine. And your analysis is spot on, Alex. :^)
