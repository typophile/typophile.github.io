  display of typefaces. I've read tens or hundreds of pages of text about hinting,
  and I've taken quite a few stabs at googling it (the word \"link\" is a pretty useless
  search term on the internet). \r\n\r\nStill I can't still quite grasp the difference
  between a hint and a link. Could someone here explain it to me?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nS."

  body: "the term Hinting or instructing as it is sometimes called, is used to describe
    a set of hints or instuctions that are used to make individual glyphs in a font
    look better at small point sizes, especially on low-resolution screens, printers,
    and other devices with fewer dots, or pixels for accurately and legibly matching
    the glyph outline. \r\n\r\na link is one of the set of instructions, and can define
    a relationship between: \r\n\r\na parent point (on the edge of the left hand size
    of a stem for instance) and \r\na child point (on the right hand edge of a stem).
    \r\n\r\nso if you were using VisualTrueType, the tool for hinting developed by
    Microsoft, a 'link command' written in the higher level VTTalk might look like
    XLink(10,8,81), where 10 is a point on the left hand side of a vertical stem,
    and 8 is a point on the right hand side of the same vertical stem. 81 is a reference
    to a CVT value (control value table reference) The term 'link' is used to decribe
    a higher level concept so that it can be written and understood more easily. The
    code for the 'link' above compiles to lower level TrueType Language, where it
    will look like 'SRP0[],10 (set reference point 10) followed by MIRP[m>RBl], 8,
    81 (move indirect relative point 8, by a distence defined in the CVT 81,)\r\n\r\nthere
    is a lot of information on the Microsoft Typography site related to hinting fonts
    with VTT. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/typography/hinting/hinttut3.htm\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you mean in the context of FontLab:\r\n\r\n- A hint is a PostScript hint.
    They are usually aligned with nodes to define a stem. They can also be converted
    to TT instructions.\r\n\r\n- A link is similar, but more generalized. Links can
    be converted to hints (or hints can be converted to links), or TT instructions.
    Unlike hints, they automatically adjust themselves if you make changes to a glyph.
    Links are especially useful when you are working with multiple masters. Links
    are shared across masters, whereas hints must be set separately for each master."

    moves or expands with them; a Hint defines a position and distance independent
    of actual outline.'

  body: "Svenni, the way I'm working with hints and links in FontLab (to produce CFF
    OpenType):\r\n\r\n1. after the outline is ready, use PS autohinting.\r\n2. manually
    edit hints and add links if necessary (usually are).\r\n3. convert these links
    to hints.\r\n4. use PS autoreplacing.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the PS hinting is
    ready to be tested.\r\n\r\nI convert all hints back to links before any edition
    is made to outlines. And then back to hints (with autoreplacing) to finalize the
    work.\r\n\r\nTT hinting is another universe I'll later step into."

    they are a convenience the UI grants to the user beyond the format's description

  body: TT links are a whole other proverbial kettle of Boston chowdah. I'm pretty
    sure the original query related to FontLab's general link tool, which is most
    easily understood as a different way or representing PS hint, not to its TT hinting
    link tools.

  body: "I shall add: there is no format difference in how FontLab Studio treats PS
    hints and PS links. When a PS-flavored font is generated (OpenType PS, Type 1),
    all PS links are converted to PS hints. When a TT-flavored font is generated (OpenType
    TT, TrueType), all PS links and hints are converted to TT hinting instructions.
    \r\n\r\nThe difference in PS hints and PS links is only a matter of how they behave
    in the FontLab Studio UI: hints don't follow outline changes while links do. "

    is going to move fwd to a simplified and less over-constraining conversion that
    works on Windows?\r\n\r\nThe current situation for screen/web text and small heads,
    is that FL hints are useless on the Mac, either for users who preference to alias
    or preference for unhinted greyscale, and on Windows it should be known by now
    that less is more.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"

  body: Re. less is more, David, it is possible to remove x-direction PS hints independent
    of y-direction, so one way to utilise FontLab's PS-to-TT hint conversion is to
    do this, leaving only y-direction hints to control alignment zones and horizontal
    stems.
