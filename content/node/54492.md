body: "Hi everybody,\r\nI was wondering if anyone knows what typefaces have been used
  in buyarock.com website. Please find the image attached. They have used two typefaces.
  1) in the word \"the\". This looks similar in proportions to honeyscript. 2) in
  the main phrase \"if she says no guarantee\". I am trying really hard to figure
  out what typeface it is. Any help is appreciated. thanks in advance. "
