    five different ''e''s, that this is actually handwritten and not a font. '

  body: "Thanks for the good info guys ;-)\r\n\r\nMaybe the magazine font is an actual
    handwritten text. Nevertheless thanks for the similar fonts catalog and extra
    suggestions you sent me. It is always nice to have a really nice \"look and fell\"
    handwritten font. Not an easy task.\r\n\r\nNella Sue is nice but it would be great
    if could be a little bit more bold for contrast, don't you think?\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/nella-sue.font\r\n\r\nSuomi
    Hand Script\r\nhttps://www.fontshop.com/families/suomi-hand-script/buy\r\n\r\nlooks
    really nice and has some extra \"personality\" added too. \r\n\r\nCheers, "
