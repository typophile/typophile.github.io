body: "A couple of months ago I started work on a mark for a furniture designer that
  specializes in custom cabinet designs.  He suggested the concept of two whales in
  a circle, which fits a sort of yin-yang aesthetic.  The client lives in Northern
  California, not too far from where there is whalewatching, and whales also suggest
  sustainability, which is an important part of the client's work.\r\n\r\nI took a
  first stab at the design [[http://www.typophile.com/node/44613|here]].  Upon visiting
  the Pacific Northwest, and going whale watching myself, I was inspired by the Native
  American woodworking designs of the orca whale.  These designs are used in Native
  American woodcraft, including totem poles.  I think that the orca works well, since
  it is one of the species that passes along the California coast up to Canada.  I
  think that the Native American inspiration works well along the lines of sustainability.
  \ Also, I think the designs are wicked cool.\r\n\r\nHere's my interpretation made
  into a logo for the client.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whelan_orca_5323.png]\r\n\r\nI
  want some feedback on how to refine, and I would also invite suggestions for a selection
  of type.  I'm looking for a humanist serif that has the two middle strokes of the
  'W' overlapping, like in Garamond, but not as stiff and mechanical.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I could not see the whales at all until I saw the previous thread. I can see
    them now but it is not easy. I also keep seeing a smiley face in the bottom tail.
    The mouth seems dogish and less whale and the transition from body to tail seems
    abrupt. my 2 cents...

  body: I'm sure you've studied some Inuit art to get to this point. The tail is the
    only part I'm not sure of. I know that they put faces within the design and I
    don't know if that was your intention. Is the tail taken from something you've
    seen?

  body: "Yes, I've based this on two works, both of which included orca faces within
    the forms of the tails.  I can rework the tail, of course.\r\n\r\nI took some
    liberty with of Innuit art, of course, since in the traditional style, the animal
    forms are made exclusively with ovoids and U-shaped forms.  Obviously, I did not
    stick strictly to this style.\r\n\r\nIn any case, is there potential in this treatment,
    or should I go back to the drawing board?\r\n\r\nIf there is potential, do you
    have any suggestions for type?  The name \"WHELAN\" will appear below the two
    whales (phonetic similarity is coincidental).\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

    I realize they were whales, it works great, but it's a hard read at first. That
    may be OK.\r\n\r\nThe only way to make it maybe an easier read would be to just
    use one whale in this case.\r\n\r\nI agree about the tail, too...that's more of
    a fish tail. Whales have more of a splayed tail."

  body: "I presented it to the client today, before many of your comments.  He liked
    it, and we agreed on two things: tone down the fin, and redo the tail.  I did
    not suggest only one whale, even though the idea occurred to me before I heard
    back from some of you, because (1) the client specifically requested \"two whales
    in a circle,\" and (2) the idea of two whales suggests a lot (sustainability,
    life-cycles, etc.)  (Thank you Miss Tiffany for picking up on that and pointing
    it out).  With the revision, I am pleased that the shape of the two whales suggests
    and ovoid and not a perfect circles. \r\n\r\nAlso, the modern face suggested by
    vintagesignman does not fit the direction I envisioned.  Right now, I'm liking
    Sabon as a type selection, although I am open to other suggestions.  Here is a
    revision, with a rough sample of Sabon (no kerning, ripped from a website).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whelansabon_5089.png]\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick

    still think you have a problem with it looking too abstract and not, well, immediately
    whalish. (That's my new word.) Have you considered a big whale with a little whale?
    Momma whale with a baby may be help make it more instantly recognizable as whales.
    But, then again, a color version would solve the abstraction, too. "

    the circle.  I forgot to mention this before, but when I presented it to the client,
    I asked him if it took him a moment to recognize the whales.  He said yes, but
    that he liked that aspect of the design.  He also said that the shapes in the
    design are the shapes he would like to pursue in his work.\r\n\r\nAdditional edits
    in this version: I cleaned up the forms of the teeth, and made the outside tail
    fin come to a point.  Finally, provided the client signs off on it, Sabon looks
    like the face I'm going with.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whelansabon2_5429.png]\r\n\r\nAlso,

  body: "@vintagesignman: I don't think your idea about the Innuit syllabary-inspired
    font is necessarily a bad idea, althought I'm not going with it for two reasons:
    \r\n\r\n(1) A design completely inspired by Native American forms would not fit
    the client; he appreciates Native American designs, yet he is of European decent,
    so a humanist serif fits better in that respect.  Since his shop is as much about
    selling himself as selling his work, I think that there needs to be some representation
    of who he is.\r\n\r\n(2) He showed me some letter forms that he has carved into
    wood, and while they are more mechanical, they have aspects that Sabon matches,
    such as the crossed middle strokes of the 'W'.  Carving these letters into wood,
    in fact, is part of a traditional cabinetmaker's apprenticeship training.  While
    no typophile himself (he keeps asking me why we can't use Times New Roman), he
    at least has experience with interacting with letterforms in wood.\r\n\r\nAnother
    reason I think a humanist serif is a good idea is that humanist faces speak of
    the earlier days of typeface crafting, just as cabinetmaking draws from deep and
    long-lasting traditions of crafting furniture.  So both express a parallel sense
    of Western heritage in the practical arts.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

    Inuktitut syllabary was adapted from the Cree syllabary in the late 19th century
    by John Horden and E. A. Watkins, missionaries from England. Edmund Peck promoted
    the use of the syllabary across the Canadian Arctic, and also translated the bible
    into Inuktitut, and wrote an Eskimo Grammar and an Eskimo-English Dictionary.
    \r\n\r\nIn 1976 the Language Commission of the Inuit Cultural Institute approved
    approved two standardized writing systems for Inuktitut in Canada: one using the
    syllabary and the other using the Latin alphabet. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontco.com/info02/arjowigginsinuit.php

    and separate from Cree and Inuit artforms. Separated culturally and by thousands
    of miles of geography. The Pacific Northwest is nowhere near Nunavut, and Inuktituk
    was never spoken there.\r\n\r\n2) Since your client has no connection to the Haida,
    Kwakiutl or Coast Salish cultures, other than the stated vague geographic one,
    I wonder if the concept is appropriate. Orcas have nothing to do with furniture-making
    or the recently immigrated.\r\n\r\n3) I think the logo itself (the original one)
    is beautifully executed. Good job. I think your subsequent modifications were
    unnecessary. You've made Arial out of a perfectly good Helvetica.\r\n\r\n4) I

    question: are the art forms of particular people groups privileged with regard

    Western European art for a logo?  What would limit Western Europeans from getting
