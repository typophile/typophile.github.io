  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Dear typophiles,</p>
<p>I came up with an idea that I want to share with everyone here including the moderators. Sorry if this subject was already discussed in some post, but I can&rsquo;t recall such post&hellip;</p>
<p>Almost every day there are people here that post some request for help to start a paper/thesis on a subject for purpose of academic studies. And everyone tries to help put some info about it. A site, an article, book or even films&hellip; Usually these request for help results in a very good starting point and lots of times people say that this article is good or did not know this book, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>I do believe that the final result of some (all?) of these article/thesis are very interesting to read, but we don&rsquo;t have access to them (well at least in a fast and organized manner&hellip;).</p>
<p>My proposal is this: Why not create a digital library of these articles/thesis? I would love to have a very reliable place to get these articles/thesis well organized&hellip;and since they usually are academic studies that can be shared without infringements of copyright, no? I know that there are the language issues, but lots of them are English and typophile is the world :)</p>
<p>I do believe that if we are interested and the persons that produce such article/thesis were interested they could share it.</p>
<p>I would love to hear from the people what do you think about this.
Sorry if this is a little off topic or if such a think already exists&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I like António&rsquo;s idea. I&rsquo;ve already seen a couple of these thesis projects around, and it certainly would be a very interesting experiment. However, as I understand, some universities limit the reproduction of thesis for masters and doctorate degrees within itself, or are otherwise only accessible in specific places where copies may be bought, such as in the National Library here in Portugal.
At least, I believe it works that way.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I know many grad students are allowed to disseminate their research, and in many cases it is a requirement. I think the idea of having a library section here at Typophile would be great. To make it even more useful, from the educational viewpoint, the submissions should be peer reviewed. Volunteers would read papers (I would be happy to volunteer) and if three, or five, peers approve of a paper, it could be <em>published</em> to the library.</p>
<p>Peer volunteers could be limited to people with two or three years activity at typophile, and at least 10 years graphic design experience.</p>
<p>Any other ideas?</p>

Yes, I know NDLTD and other digital libraries that do the same thing. My goal was to get a more specific/easy/small library&hellip;</p>
