body: "Does anyone know of a software/shareware program that will print font spec
  sheets, especially with key commands for Mac O/S?\r\n\r\nIn the old days of System
  9 for Mac users, I had a type utility called \"TypeBook 4.0\" that allowed me to
  create sample pages (specimen sheets) for all of my type fonts. There were several
  options in TypeBook to do this, and the one that was the best was printing out (for
  example, a picture font) with the associated keyboard commands to get each character.
  This was great to have if you used picture fonts a lot, or special characters.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
  TypeBook, at least as far as I can tell, did not make the transition to O/S X for
  Apple Macintosh computers.\r\n\r\nI have tried demo versions recently of:\r\n1.
  Veenix software's \"Font Tools\"\r\n2. Extensis software's \"Suitcase-Fusion\"\r\n\r\nVeenix
  did not work with O/S x.4 and Suitcase Fusion, besides seemingly taking over your
  desktop, does not print a \"keyboard command\" style specimen sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks."

    picture fonts in Adobe CS or system-wide (through the Input Menu)."

    be difficult. I don't know of any extant utilities that will print a specimen

    prints both spec sheets and key codes. It's $10 shareware.
