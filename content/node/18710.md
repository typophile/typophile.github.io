    Adobe's and Bitstreams together. The weights vary a little as do some of the details
    -- traps and no traps -- which I find important.

      I had seen the FuturaND version, but it's awfully expensive since they make
      you buy each one separately (I think).\r\n\r\nTiffany, why do you prefer Adobe/Bitstream
      over URW?"

  body: I was going to mention that. It was one of the earliest fonts Adobe released
    and it is not real good, especially the Heavy weight. I just took a look at a
    PDF of the current version on Adobe's website. It's not quite as bad as the samples
    that Erik Spiekermann shows, so it appears they have made some alterations since
    it was first released, but it's still not great (in my opinion). The other weights
    aren't as bad, but notice also that the italics are all just slanted romans, not
    optically adjusted. I'm partial to Bitstream's cut, especially for text.

  body: "Yes, Adobe's Futura surely isn't that good at all, for example if you set
    it without linespacing (as was called \"Kompress\" in the days of metal type over
    here in germany) ascenders and descenders will overlap. That surely woudln't have
    happened with metal type, so that's a technical fault to Adobe Futura, at least
    to my understanding.\r\nOn the best version, that's a bit down to personal taste
    i think, as the different digitizings have different approaches or emphasize different
    aspects and qualities of Futura:\r\nThe URW version seems to stress the somewhat
    elegant quality Futura has and appears pretty thin to me, whereas the Berthold
    BQ version seems much more stable and robust to me (and if you look at old prints
    of Futura, it surely had that quality as well and didn't come across as the super-elegant
    thing we're used to from cosmetics packagings and the like today!) \r\nSo my personal
    vote would be for the BQ-version if i had to buy it \u2013 the strange thing is
    Futura is one of the faces i love, admire and respect the most \u2013 but never
    use it! :-)\r\n\r\np.s. besoides the best digizings issue, it's such a shame that
    the different optical sizes that were made for Futura metal didn't survive into
    the digital age\u2026"

    MdCn BT has about the ugliest micron char I've ever seen, and lacks all other

    are naturally the ones we use in formulas the most frequently. The Greek version
    of the font has all those chars, but loses many mathematical operators. *sigh*\r\n\r\nEF's
    Md Condensed has the Greek chars we need, the mathematical operators, and comes
    in ital, so that looks like the winner for now. I wish we could have small caps,
    too, but sometimes we have to be practical!"

  body: "Thanks Tiffany.\r\nI never became eccessively affectionate with Futura, but
    I think the problem is that I have become accustomed to the typeface in its early
    digital formats. very limited, and based on a single point size, while I cherished
    a great number lead types which were still in use in the 1970s here in Italy.\r\nFor
    example, I think there is no comparision with the original Monotype lead version
    of Gill Sans in all its point sizes, and their digital version.\r\n\r\nIf someone
    will make the effort to design a few good master sizes, and with the quality which
    seems to have the Neufville Digital ND version (I think Robert Trogman is right
    about the accuracy), we will probably have an adequate Futura for every page format
    with all the needed sizes."
