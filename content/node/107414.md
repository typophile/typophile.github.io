  for some time in calligraphy, and would really enjoy seeing one in Hebrew. I looked
  for some time and did not quite find what I was looking for. Even the typeface on
  \"The Hobbit\" poster in Hebrew wasn't quite what I was looking for. \r\n\r\nSo
  far, (http://www.cjstones.com/prod_images/lettering/HebrewScript.jpg) is the closest
  thing I have found. Of course, I would add some dots for embellishment to make it
  more like what most of us are familiar with.\r\n\r\n\u05EA\u05D5\u05D3\u05D4 \u05E8\u05D1\u05D4!
