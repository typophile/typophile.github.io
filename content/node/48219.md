  it's time for me to purchase some font software for use at home (I'm still rocking
  Fontographer at work....gotta love them whoosh and bleeps!) but I'm wondering if
  TypeTool would be suitable for use at home, or is it gonna be a case of tying a
  hand behind my back for the sake of a few hundred quid?\r\n\r\nObviously, it down
  to what I intend to do, but; I don't want to count anything out. I have grand intentions
  for my sketches and scribbles and would be super vex if I found something I desperately
  want is missing from the cheaper option. So I'm interested in full featured opentype
  with ligatures galore, serious kerning tools, and also a heavy duty proofing system...and
  quite probably in the future numerous things I don't understand yet.\r\n\r\nSlightly
  random, but I'm definitely a freehand tool style fan, as opposed to Illustrator
  style method of handling points etc. Do either lean towards one of those methods?\r\nFrom
  what I've picked up reading the forum, a majority of you use FontLab, I rarely see
  anyone discussing TypeTool. I guess it's case of you get what you pay for?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any advice imparted, and apologies if there's already an existing
  thread discussing this.\r\nPeace y'all!"

  body: I use typetools. If you want to use opentype features, then it's probably
    not the tool for you. I'm happy with it, I wish I could script and add alternates
    and ligatures and classy kerning ;) , but can't really justify the expense of
    fontlab for the kind of use i give it.

  body: I was stubborn for a long time and tried to do everything with TypeTool and
    VOLT. As you can imagine, help was hard to get. Eventually I was sold on the fact
    that FontLab's interpolation could take the Regular and Black faces I had done
    and instantly produce the corresponding Bold for me with very little cleanup needed.
    After I upgraded, I found that I had put a whole lot of unnecessary work into
    many things that would have been a lot quicker and easier with FontLab.

    with fancy kerning and ligature scripting :)"

    also that we type designers are a small community, and FontLab is a part of our
    community. They support us, just as we support them. FontLab employees visit online
    forums, hold lectures and workshops at virtually every conference, and help sponsor
    events, too. Many of the changes they build into their products are based on feedback
    from paying customers. I think that a company like that is worth my support, and
    I'm proud to be one of those using their software."

  body: My comment wasn't meant as an attack on FontLab products and the good people
    who make them. Far from it. I only meant to remind end users to keep an open mind
    and not disregard the competition out of hand. Even in a niche market, competition
    is healthy for keeping product development and maintenance fresh and creative.
