  be identified, that's okay. Something close will do. Seems like it would be simple
  to find and I know I have seen similar fonts. Any ideas? \r\n\r\nImage to work from
  is attached. Thanks!"

  body: That's very strange the way they did that, but yep, that sure seems to be
    the one. Thanks a bunch, DPape! I believe you also helped me out a couple months
    ago.

  body: "Your original link was to DaFont, and it was broken, and it looked like it
    used to work. Do you think DaFont removed Blippo because it was an illegal offering?
    That would be nice of them. If so, do you think it's a good idea to follow suit?\r\n\r\nWhat's
    interesting is, where did you get that broken DaFont link? The only way I can
    think of is if you have a database of all your fonts that shows where to get each
    one, and you passed along the source that's currently acceptable to Typophile
    moderators, except you didn't realize that it no longer worked. Once you realized,
    you edited your post to point to MyFonts (which you could have actually done from
    the beginning).\r\n\r\nBTW I would certainly believe that you get many of your
    fonts from places other than DaFont.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Wonder who gets the money
    $25 on this 1970 font ...</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAre you saying that fonts older
    than 40 years should be free?\r\n\r\nCould you point to a font that you feel is
    worth purchasing?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
