What if the apron was blowing behing him a bit? And you might also want to change the chef's hat to the more traditional one, or rather the one that most people identify with chefs. Perhaps more of a round nose and less of a carrot stick. Just suggestions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments and suggestions. I will post another few possibilities soon. <BR> <BR>My illustration was based on a piece of clip art I found in one of Dover's books &ndash; which apparently was also the basis for the dingbat. I am curious about the issue of incorporating illustration work done by someone else &ndash; do you think there's something wrong with that? Obviously it's in the public domain so I'm not stealing anything from anyone. Is there any difference between that and using another person's typeface design (which this is)? <BR>Is it just because it's a logo? I see designs (including logos) all the time that obviously incorporate old artwork. (Art Chantry's work comes to mind.) <BR> <BR>I don't mean to argue with you, I sincerely am interested in what you think. <BR> <BR>Maybe it's better for me to explore type-only solutions (especially if the chef looks like a pig &ndash;ha!) <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Troy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Troy, it is probably legal to use a &quot;prefabricated&quot; ilustration. The problem is that you do not have exclusive rights to use it., so your neighbour may use the very same ilustration in his logo some day. In such a case you could have a tough time telling your clients that you &quot;serve&quot; original design done exclusively for them&hellip;</div>

It isn't *probably* legal, <BR>it's legal legal legal. <BR> <BR>I think the word &quot;discovered&quot; made it sound like you had <BR>done something wrong, which clearly, you didn't and <BR>clearly that wasn't Tiffany's intention. <BR> <BR>All that said &hellip; <BR> <BR>I looked at your original intentions (non-corporate, entertainment focus) <BR>and the Retro 30s look, imo, is not your strongest direction. <BR> <BR>The Tasty type treatment is problematic because the <BR>T and Y are rendered so small in comparison to the  <BR>other letters. I do enjoy the letterforms themselves. <BR> <BR>And the logo could just as well be for a caterer or cake designer. <BR> <BR>The word &quot;Tasty&quot; is not the easiest thing to illustrate &hellip; <BR> <BR>Sometimes the solution just comes from sketching or <BR>fiddling in Illustrator.

		<div class="commentbody">Troy, I think you have two separate ideas that you are trying to force together. A 30's retro theme and illustrating tasty design. If its the 30's feel you are after maybe the word you are looking for isn't tasty, but Elegant might fit better. In either case follow PJ's advice, I once had a mortgage refi project and I presented 15 concepts, marker on paper, 75 concepts later I got the 3 that left the agency and i can tell you I'd still be working on them if I did it on a computer.</div>
