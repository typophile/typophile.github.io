body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am new to the forum, and very impressed of the quality and amount
  of information on this site. I am hoping for your help on finding a contemporary
  sans serif, that has readability in long text settings and large enough family to
  include condensed styles.\r\n\r\nThis is for a minor redesign of a magazine on culture
  and society. The magazine uses a lot of illustration and it's printed with just
  two spot colors on an uncoated paper. The overall feel is quite airy, graphic and
  a bit experimental. Current fonts for body text and headlines are ITC Franklin Gothic
  and Arnhem Blond, with occasional SerifedSans headlines and some flourishes to spice
  it up. I will keep the flourishes, and the basic layout, but I will change the text
  fonts and redesign some of the details.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I am looking for something
  contemporary and new instead of, say Frutiger, is quite vain - it's just to keep
  it fun for me. I already have some good candidates, but I would love to hear of
  any new ideas. I'm sure there are still some treasures to be found.\r\n\r\nThis
  is what the new font set should consist of:\r\n\r\n2 headline fonts\r\n- Farnham
  Display Swash Italic / this is decided & bought already\r\n- a condensed sans serif
  - like Trade Gothic Bold Condensed No. 20, but Trade Gothic doesn't cut it for the
  body text\r\n\r\n2 body text fonts\r\n- modern, light sans serif with readability
  (even for long finnish words) with a family that has the condensed style needed
  for the headline. I'm thinking maybe Fresco Sans? \r\n- a serif that's something
  like ITC Charter - and has a 'b' similar to Charter. Arnhem is beautiful, but starting
  to be a bit overused here and lacks the lightness and modern feel of Charter. Any
  ideas for this are also welcome.\r\n\r\nBoth the sans and the serif need to have
  a light, modern feel, but also some warmth. For sans I would love to use Bliss,
  or maybe even Mundo Sans, but both lack the condensed style.\r\n\r\nI might be getting
  my terms wrong, or explain myself poorly, so let me know if this doesn't make any
  sense to you. Attached are some pictures of the magazine to give you an idea of
  the design. Thanks in advance for your help!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I highly recommend <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=brown+gothic\">Brown
    Gothic</a> to replace Trade Gothic. It works well in text sizes, but is even better
    for display as it has more character than Trade. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/bulldog/\">Bulldog</a>
    is also a good alternative for the same reasons. Its true italic makes it an even
    better candidate for text. It could be used along with Brown Gothic Condensed
    for headlines.\r\n\r\nI'm surprised to hear that Arnhem is overused. Things must
    be looking beautiful in Finland. Have you considered <a href=\"http://www.ourtype.be/\">OurType</a>'s
    newest text serif Amalia? <a href=\"http://www.ourtype.be/pdf/OT-Amalia.pdf\">Download
    the PDF</a> for a decent look."

    body: "Thank you for your quick reply!\r\nI quite like Bulldog for text setting
      and Brown Gothic for display. But without the other neither of them is quite
      what I need for this project. And I would like to use just one font for sans
      to keep the total number of fonts down to three - and to have one full family
      for later use.\r\nAny other suggestions..?\r\n\r\n> I\u2019m surprised to hear
      that Arnhem is overused.\r\n\r\nWell, this might be my subjective view, having
      worked on 4 different magazines using it. Although, it is a small market so
      sometimes good things just spread around on a word-to-mouth basis everywhere
      really quickly.\r\n\r\n> Things must be looking beautiful in Finland. \r\n\r\nNah,
      of Nordic countries, I'd say Sweden is the place to look for beautifully set
      magazines."

    body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nOk, been thinking about it a while, and now I know what I need:\r\n\r\n-
      a humanist sans\r\n- open forms ('c' and 's' for example)\r\n- curved serifs
      in 'a'\r\n- a beautiful italic\r\n\r\nSo yes, Franklin, Spiegel and Bulldog
      would be too 'rigid'. <a ref><http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=mundo+sans&site=d&btnG=Go>Mundo
      Sans</a ref> fits the description perfectly (but does not have the condensed
      bold).\r\n\r\nBut \u2013 with these specifications I am not likely to find a
      font with a condensed bold and/or the kind of closed forms as in <a ref><http://www.linotype.com/13013/tradegothicboldcondensed20-font.html>Trade
      Gothic Bold Condensed no 20</a ref> or <a ref><http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/franklin_gothic_extra_condensed/&sample_text=NO%20JUSTICE&sample_size=36>Franklin
      Gothic Extra Condensed</a ref>, am I?\r\n\r\nDo you think that it would be too
      much to mix 4 different fonts in one magazine? I have always preferred to keep
      the number down to 2-3 so I hesitate.\r\n \r\nIf I go for 4 different fonts,
      Mundo Sans is on the top of my list. Any other suggestions with these specifications?"

    body: "Thanks! I took a new look at Fresco Sans, which was my original favorite,
      and Agenda - they got on the list. Formata is beautiful but not quite what I'm
      looking for.\r\n\r\ntop 3 for now:\r\n\r\n1. Agenda \u2013 in text setting,
      exactly what I'm looking for, but would require another sans for display\r\n2.
      Mundo Sans \u2013 would work both text and display, if I give up on the condensed
      bold cut\r\n3. Fresco Sans \u2013 not as warm and rounded as the other two,
      and not as much character in display as Mundo Sans\r\n\r\nSo I guess it'll be
      either Agenda or Mundo Sans. Any comments on either one? Is there still something
      I should see, similar to these two?\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    there's a Fresco Condensed in FontShop - didn't see one in OurType pages. I had
    already decided to go with Mundo Sans, but you made me change my mind.\r\n\r\nThis
    has been a difficult choice, not least because the project is more of a hobby
    and has no budget, so I need to be able to use the fonts later too. But I think
    I have a good set now.\r\n\r\nSo thank you all, my choice is Fresco Sans + Charter
    + Farnham Display.\r\n\r\n"
