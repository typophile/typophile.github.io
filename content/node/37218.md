  leaded me to Zubilo Black from ParaType (sample here: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/zubilo-black/),
  which is the same exactly font I\u2019m looking for.\r\nThe reason for I\u2019m
  posting here is that I\u2019m quite sure an older font than the one digitalized
  by ParaType exists, but I can\u2019t find its name (maybe it has never been digitalized
  before).\r\nAnyone has a clue?\r\nThank you all,\r\nbye"

    bouncy, irregular, blocky shape style is not really a new thing, if you go back
    to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/artistik/\">Artistik</a>, and Harquil
    (which has been digitized as \"Harlequin\", and is shown in Solotype and Petzendorfer
    books, and very similar to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/gaiety-girl/\">Gaiety
    Girl</a>), which are both Art Nouveau era (over 110 years old). There are others,
    including <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tailspinstudio/softie/\">Softie</a>,
    that MyFonts Uses all over its site.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "Angel, I looked at one of those ComixHeavy versions and noticed that the
    E, A and O were not the same as Zubilo. I didn't look at all the characters, but
    the two fonts only seem to be very similar. I suspect one is a 'tweak' of the
    other perhaps.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: You may be looking at a different version Mike. The caps only from ComixHeavy
    <a href="http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/62?text=AaBbCcDdEeFfGg">here</a> do
    match the caps in Zubilo. Pat Snyder's <a href="http://www.patsnyderartist.com/patsnyder_fonts.html">website</a>
    has a showing of Comics Cartoon II too. The lowercase from Zubilo may be original,
    don't really know about that.

    of those letters, which are alternate caps. I didn't download the font, which
    would have told the story.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
