  working on a typographic characteristic poster with Adobe Caslon as my font. I am
  having trouble figuring out noteworthy aspects of the characters, however, and was
  hoping I could get some help here. Obviously the uppercase Q's tail is important,
  as well as the curved apex of the A, but I'm struggling to come up with much more
  than that. Any help would be appreciated, Thanks! \r\n-I'm supposed to have around
  20 characteristics, by the way."

  body: "Perhaps the main notable thing about Caslon's types is their very high degree
    of inconsistency (which some people see as warm, and others -including myself-
    as sloppy). Speaking of the \"Q\", it's especially notable in the Italic, where
    it undergoes dramatic <em>topological</em> changes depending on point size; see
