  body: light is ok, but bold could be a bit bolder from my perspective. But you probably
    realize you have weight variation within each font? "n"s are all to heavy for
    each and so are "f"s, "a"s and "t"s.

  body: 'Look at the variations in vertical and horisontal strokes. Especially the
    g in light is evidence of the problem with visual variation: here the horisontals
    are to light compared to the verticals.'

  body: I like the direction you've given to this typeface. However, I've noticed
    some irregular junction or non linear line in some glyph, but may be it's the
    way you want your design. If not, I think you'll have to correct it. See the red
    line around what I think the problem are.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Test_4414.png]

  body: I think you should visit all vectors, because most of them look a bit bumpy.
    None of the curves are really smooth. But ok, that is something you can practice.

  body: yeah I've found that taking the drawing illustrator to fontlab really shows
    up any faults. Fontlab is much more accurate tool but i'm no used to using yet.
    cheers for the help guys.

  body: "Yeah, FontLab is definitely a very good help to smoothen out the vectors.
    :)\r\nAs long as you use the b\xE9ziers right, it should be fine (points in extrema,
    letting handles do the same amount of work, etc.).  :)"
