  have identified most condensed ones as Hoefler Knockout variations, some Poplar,
  Ziggurat I believe, Bodoni poster etc.\r\n\r\nI have circled the ones I still can't
  figure out - the image is small I know.\r\nIf you have any ideas please share.\r\n\r\np.s.
  - the photo I believe is from an advert for entr'acte music label...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/victoriana_5952.jpg]"
