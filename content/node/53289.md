body: "I think my post falls under \"searching for a certain style of typeface\",
  hence my post in the Design Forum.\r\n\r\nI am looking for an unserifed face to
  accompany [[http://www.teff.nl/fonts/collis/index.html|Collis]].\r\n\r\nI will be
  setting papers and essays with the two fonts (still a student) and maybe a book
  one day. It is not for a specific project.\r\n\r\nI will use Collis as a text face
  and the unserifed typeface would be used for titles, headings and maybe for the
  notes and quotes. Maybe on a later date I will use the unserifed typeface for the
  entire text.\r\n\r\nI prefer an unserifed face from a modern (still living and active)
  type designer. So please, do bring my attention to your own font if you think they
  would be a good match.\r\n\r\nThanks, Terence"

  body: "Thank you all for your suggestions. I will look at all of them and compare
    them to see which one suits best. It took me a year to make up my mind to buy
    Collis, and I am planing to take my time in choosing the right accompanying typeface
    in Open Type.\r\n\r\nQuincunx: I saved a few years (I have a job too pay for my
    education) and I could pay for Collis becaus as a student I could pay in instalments.
    And now I have saved enough to pay for an unserifed typeface :-)"

  body: "Nice, that's a good deal. I think Collis is a beautiful typeface, very typical
    to the school you are (according to your site) currently attending (KABK). Very
    Den Haag. ;)\r\n\r\nMaybe another The Hague or Dutch typeface as a sans serif
    companion would work best, since it will be designed with the same principles
    in mind. A few of those have been mentioned in this thread. :)"
