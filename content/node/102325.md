  this exact topic, please redirect me if there is.\r\n\r\nSo what is your chosen
  version of Helvetica? Or should I say Helvetica Neue (as most people will be using
  as opposed to the original digit 'cut').\r\n\r\nFrom working at various design agencies,
  studios, other people's computers etc I have probably used every version of Helvetica
  going. There are many, plus now we also have Christian Schwarz's digitized Neue
  Haas Grotesk to content with. But is it possible to advise and settle the issue?
  Is one foundry's version objectively the best?\r\n\r\nPlease discuss!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nLewis"

    it would appear to be you, as you have worked with so many Helveticas. So why
    you asking?!\r\n\r\nIMO, working with a typeface in a layout app, developing a
    document design and then seeing it in print/on screen is the best way to assess
    a face, rather than just seeing it around output in other designers\u2019 work.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s
    your opinion, and why? \r\nPlease support by showing examples of your work with
    Helvetica."

  body: "Thanks for the comments fellas.\r\n\r\nSorry Nick, I don't have many examples
    to hand on file from past work, and I don't have the versions I used on other
    machines of course. But I do remember giving a good study at the time. I noticed
    slightly different x heights and different variations for the same corresponding
    weights. Because of the weight issue, some worked better a smaller sizes and others
    as large/display. As Frode mentioned, there were other factors, like language
    support, which wouldn't affect me as everything I've done is in English (well,
    once in German). \r\n\r\nSo I guess what I wondered is maybe someone had already
    looked into the specifics of the different versions. I like the Linotype cut,
    but I really like the sound of Schwarz's Neue Hass Grotesk so hopefully one day
    I'll either get that or have an opportunity to use it. But what I really need
    to look into is the main differences between Linotype and Adobe versions. I know
    I should have before raising this thread!\r\n\r\nI didn't know about Unica, but
    made for interesting googling thanks. Sounds a little bit like the efforts made
    with aforementioned Neue Haas Grotesk remake? \r\n\r\nBut in being the mighty,
    ubiquitous typeface that it is (I wrote a chapter in my university dissertation
    looking at the topic of globalisation and helvetica, or rather the global usage
    of it) it seems odd that it isn't easy to settle on a \"definitive\" version of
    it, at least out of the popularly available versions (as I imagine there is a
    theoretical debate about what constitutes a \"definitive\" version of it)."

  body: Why does it matter so much which cut ends up as the definitive choice?  It
    is more a combination of how it does the specific task at hand and personal taste.
    Why not just add every other grotesk ever drawn to the mix as well? Frode's comment
    is a pretty fair question to ask.

  body: I don't disagree. What I mean to do is put the question out as a hypothesis.
    If the simple answers is "no" then the next step in the hypothesis is whether
    there are strong factors/reasons why one version might be better for specific
    uses than another. Right now, just saying it is personal taste leaves it open
    and somewhat chaotic. There must be more concrete and informed opinions and reasoning
    towards preferences in different versions of Helvetica? For a more potent example,
    take a look at the issues with Garamond, and how much fuss the ITC cut caused.
    There isn't the same situation with Helvetica, but I am sure there is a lot to
    be said about the pros and cons of one version over another.

  body: "<blockquote>Or should I say Helvetica Neue</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNo, I think
    you shouldn\u2019t. \u2018Neue Helvetica\u2019 is the right name. The decision
    to put \u2018Neue\u2019 behind Helvetica is a font menue sorting issue. Unfortunately,
    fonts do not have such a thing as a \u2018sorting name\u2019 by which both Adobe
    Garamond and ITC Garamond would be automatically sorting under G. And Helvetica
    and Neue Helvetica under H. Another thing is that PostScript fonts did not allow
    numbers in the font names. So Frutigers number system, which Stempel (they took
    care of the Linotype library those days) had adopted for naming the weights of
    many other new /re-designed families such as Janson Text, could not be used in
    the font menues. The Mac 4-style family strategy was \u2018chosen\u2019 instead.
    Shit happens."

  body: Excellent, nice one Nick, thanks a lot for that. I used to subscribe but now
    I only get the occasional issue of Eye. Missed that one completely though. Would
    want to see it in any case but sold on Vignelli. I recently bought his Canon as
    I was tired of looking back to the free pdf version and much prefer things in
    print. Don't we all?! Also, speaking of that link, the Helvetica on the eye website
    seems to render nicely, doesn't it? Going to have to investigate their style sheets...

    I would have thought that the design was no longer protected even in Europe, just
    as Optima and Palatino are able to be copied. So I am surprised there are not
    imitations of it all over the place, given that it is felt to be Helvetica \"done
