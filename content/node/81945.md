  could help me out, i hope the question isn't too dumb :D.\r\n\r\nwhen someone of
  you makes a corporate identity for a business, museum, government,Academy...\r\n\r\nWhen
  the project is finished, what exactly is property of the client, especially when
  it comes to the Logo. I mean, do you give all files including vector files of the
  logo or do you \"never\" give the illustrator eps or ai file to the client? \r\n\r\nkind
  of like \"if i do give the vector files they might never work with me again since
  they have all they need.\r\n\r\nAlso what kind of formats for the logo need to be
  included when delivering the final product to the client (TIFF, JPEG...?)\r\n\r\nx"

  body: The vector files should be included. I mean, do you really expect, that the
    client asks you, whenever he wants to lossless scale the logo? This would be almost
    extortion. Additionally the vector files may be needed for printing. You only
    should not add font files, that you have licensed. Alternatively you can transfer
    the license.

  body: Logos are frequently work-for-hire, which is a legal term that means the client
    buys the copyright from you, so that you literally no longer own your work. In
    this case, you would give all associated files to the client. If the work is not
    work-for-hire, I would definitely supply the work in vector format (assuming I
    wasn't also doing the associated branding and typography work), but not the source
    files (i.e., eps but not Illustrator).

  body: "Unless your contract with them states otherwise, they're entitled to the
    vector files along with any other files you made that they might reasonably need.
    (Working files, like a layered Photoshop file for example, normally wouldn't be
    given to a client unless they specifically requested it.)\r\n\r\n> if i do give
    the vector files they might never work with \r\n> me again since they have all
    they need\r\n\r\nYou get future work from them by 1) doing a great job on the
    identity project, and 2) making them aware of your capabilities to do other projects
    they might have (brochures, websites, or whatever). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'll add that it's probably a good idea to not only provide the "working"
    vector files (Illustrator, Photoshop or whatever) but also EPS (for high-end printing)
    and EMF (for use in MS Word applications) versions.  Maybe a big TIFF or PNG too.
