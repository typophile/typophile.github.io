  this book entitled \r\n\r\nJUDGE NOT MY SINS: http://static.artfire.com/admin/product_images/thumbs/--120000--113309_product_189355421_thumb_large.jpeg\r\n\r\nand
  also SIN BAIT: http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3076/2699659219_255c4b1b8d.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\nThis site is a godsend.\r\n\r\nThere is this other site that is NSFW
  that does what all of you guys do, but instead of fonts, they ID porn actresses.
  It's called Peachyforum. They are amazing in that you can upload one picture, and
  they can ID the actress, know what pseudonyms they've also worked under, if they've
  retired, that sort of thing. People contain so much knowledge. I am charmed by it
  all.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The key point in your title is 'old'. Judging from the price of the second
    one, these were published well before digital fonts were around (mid-80's), meaning
    that the lettering was either drawn by a lettering artist, or was possibly photo-letering
    (film type). The SIN BAIT lettering is similar to many condensed sans serif fonts
    you can find, but the script from the other book was probably hand-drawn. You
    might find similar fonts searching for 'brush script' styles.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    very close to it? I am designing the cover for a book that is supposed to be a
    call-back to these pulpy books and I'm charmed by the SIN BAIT's directness. Also,
    it seems that that simple straightforward font is also used on the covers of a
    lot of pulp novels around that time.\r\n\r\nThanks."
