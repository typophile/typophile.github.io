  have just released ITC Avant Garde Gothic Pro which appears to contain lots of ligatures.
  Not sure if its comprehensive but have a look at this pdf: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/pdfs/AGPro.pdf\r\n\r\n"

    the slant vs. true oblique cut issue. It just might be that all of the advertising
    and specimen samples are incorrect and that the fonts are just fine.\r\n\r\nEither
    way, it's a little issue of quality assurance and customer expectations. I used
    to work for the very same person Allan reports to now."

    Tamye Riggs and Allan Haley.\r\n\r\nI had the chance to take Allan aside and show
    him the posts on ITC Avant Garde Gothic found on Typographica's forum.\r\n\r\nAllan
    said that Monotype Imaging had discussed the oblique versions for a long time,
    and in the end, it came down to two main considerations:\r\n\r\n1- They felt that
    the Adobe versions of AGG Oblique had become the <em>de facto</em> standard, thus
    the Pro version would be consistent; and\r\n\r\n2- Developmental expenses.\r\n\r\nOK,
    that's fair enough. How many designers are still setting with digitized versions
    of the 1977 release. But why did Adobe decide on slanted versions in the first
    place? Any insights anybody?\r\n\r\n(BTW -- Allan's comments to me was his sincere
    explanation of reasons for corporate decisions and should not be considered as
    an \"official statement\" by Monotype Imaging on the issue.)"

    the original oblique is interesting, but disappointing.\r\n\r\nAs far as the part
    about Adobe using a slanted version to begin with, that was their standard method
    in the early days with all sans serifs. No doubt it saved memory in the early
    PostScript laser printers and imagesetters and was considered a neat and practical
    compromise. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is ITC's design. Why should they follow
    Adobe's lead on what it should look like? Like I said in my Typographica post,
    ain't what ITC used to be."

  body: "I guess we should remember that Adobe set the naming convention rules here
    for re-issues.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand part of the reason for adding 'std' and
    'pro' to font names was to reinforce the \"no guarantee of backwards compatibility\"
    message - so ITC could have broken with the past on a pro font. \r\n\r\nHowever
    in reality the re-issued Adobe fonts are mostly mergings of the existing Type
    1 fonts with only a few extensions. So ITC's treatment of AG really isn't any
    different from the Adobe re-issues. \r\n\r\nFortunately Adobe has extended the
    rules of the game with Garamond Premier Pro, which leaves the door open for a
    \"Premier Pro AG\" at some point in the future. :-)\r\n\r\n  "

    this is true. But every typeface with \"Pro\" in the name had its character set
    extended. And if you look at Adobe Originals, most of them got reworked, many
    of them extensively. Notably for this discussion, Cronos Pro got the italic completely
    redone. Adobe Garamond, Minion, Myriad and many others got some revisions. We
    treated our real flagship typefaces with great care.\r\n\r\nAmusingly, our OpenType
    \"Standard\" version of ITC Avant Garde is based on the Avant Garde MM outlines,
    rather than the single-master outlines. So we were already not worrying about
    matching the old one that most people know.\r\n\r\nThat being said, these things
    are a lot of work, and as digital type users were already used to the mechanically
    slanted obliques for ITC Avant Garde (which Adobe popularized), I can understand
    why ITC/Monotype didn't want to spend the substantial work to redraw them.\r\n\r\nSi

    Premier Pro has exactly three things in common with Adobe Garamond: it's a Robert
    Slimbach design, a revival of Garamont's romans and Granjon's italics, and it's
    an Adobe Original. But it is a completely different design, and otherwise unrelated
    to Adobe Garamond - not an updated version of it in any way.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    offered both oblique and italic. I will wait for Veronika (E+F) to add more goodies
