  body: "If you are open to the idea of 'similar', then there are many hand printing
    fonts that might work. Here are three suggestions picked from the freebies at
    Dafont: [[http://www.dafont.com/venus-flytrap-and-t.font?nb_ppp=50&text=ARTSCAPE+JULY|Venus
    Flytrap]] by Jakob Fischer (a.k.a. Pizzadude); [[http://www.dafont.com/high-fiber.font?nb_ppp=50&text=ARTSCAPE+JULY|High
    Fiber]] from Cumberland Fontworks; and [[http://www.dafont.com/sue-ellen-francis.font?nb_ppp=50&text=ARTSCAPE+JULY|Sue
    Ellen Francis]] by Kimberly Geswein.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    suggestions though.

  body: "Well, I guess if this post was an IQ test, I would have flunked.  Now I see
    that you did sort of tell us that was what you wanted, but it wouldn't hurt to
    be even more explicit in your request wording. \r\n\r\nThe numbers appear to be
    severely widened, probably way beyond the font design. The closest approximation
    I can suggest is to take a Western slab face like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/old-towne-no-536/|Old
    Towne]] and really widen the heck out of it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
