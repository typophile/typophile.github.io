  not wholly justified is it? alligned i guess, but what kind.  i'm a student and

  body: "The process is called tracking, the alignment is known as forced justified,
    it works okay(ish) in the first three lines but by the fourth there are too few
    characters and the tracking has left it with way too much space. If I <em>had</em>
    to do this I would look at taking the comma out of the measure so that RTY all
    aligned and slightly indenting the F to create a better vertical on the left and
    close up the bottom line and centre it under the others. For a clear reason to
    avoid it, compare the spaces in the first two lines. Unless you really want to
    upset your tutors I would avoid doing this altogether. \r\nTim"

    don't think it's Myriad but am drawing a blank."

  body: That is the original ampersand if I'm not mistaken. Linotype used a more conventional
    shape when producing the first digital version, probably because they feared people
    might find the unusual shape too... errr... unusual.
