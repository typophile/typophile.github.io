body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nJust joined up in the hope of getting some constructive criticism
  of a logo project I am working on. There is no budget, I am not a professional but
  enjoy typography and am trying to help a guy out.\r\n\r\nIt's for a one man local
  gardener - maintenance, pruning, lawns, minor landscaping etc in a medium sized
  town of reasonable average affluence! It would potentially be used for business
  cards and on a van.\r\n\r\nSome fonts I played with were a bit too formal and I
  ended up on Lithos pro - I feel it has a slightly 'nature/organic' feel without
  being too childish. The current font used on the chap's cards is Comic Sans so I
  figure anything is better than that.\r\n\r\nThere's three slight variations in the
  attached pdf - All criticism welcome and I'm sure it'll be constructive as the help
  on this site always seems to be concise and helpful.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance\r\nChris"

    for?\r\n\r\nThe \"Gardening\" & PG's with the leaves text - don't feel like you
    HAVE to add elements so that people know something has been \"designed\" i.e,
    the shovel replacing a letter combined with the tree combined with the PG mark
    - it needs to communicate...simply. So, in short don't add unnecessary elements/detail
    just cause you can.\r\n\r\nThe leaf in the P works as a stand alone element, but
    I have a feeling it'll just join a whole raft of others in the same industry.\r\n\r\n;)\r\n\r\nI
    like the tree icon, it has a retro cartoon/illustration feel to it (colouring
    mainly)...that could really be worth exploring...you know, the whole hand lawn
    mowers, pink lemonade, housewives and big cars. And certainly expands a world
    of exploration for additional elements.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Not bad for a \"non-professional\" logo design. My thoughts:\r\n\r\nI've
    never been a fan of logos that replace a character with a graphic. Not only does
    it make the type less legible, and as Ratbaggy stated, logos are all about simple
    and quick communication, but it often draws attention to areas of the logo that
    aren't important. Also, with the leaf being used as the counter for the P, it's
    a neat idea, but I think in this case it modifies the feel and weight of the P
    too much and affects legibility.\r\n\r\nI do, however, really like the leaf you've
    drawn. (Assuming you drew it yourself.) I think it's a very strong element and
    could almost carry the logo itself. Perhaps if you were to make it much bigger
    so that you could reverse the PG out and place it inside the leaf? I think that
    would make a really classy, simple logo that also has a bit of unique identifiability
    to it.\r\n\r\nThe tree icon's not bad either, but I feel the tree and leaf are
    a little too different stylistically to exist in the same logo, and personally
    I prefer the leaf. It would also make the logo easier to reproduce on a budget,
    as it would look great in either color or black and white. Then again, I always
    lean towards the simplest solution, especially when it comes to logo design."

  body: "@ Ratbaggy - Thanks for your comments; The 'PG' are the initials of the chap
    who's company it is. Also I agree about having too many elements that it probably
    loses focus as a piece. I liked the idea of replacing the 'I' with the shovel
    but it is a bit distracting.\r\n\r\n@ryantoyota - Again thanks for the comments;
    You also mentioned the unnecessary graphic replacing the 'I' and I think you are
    both right in hindsight. The leaf and tree are different stylistically and I probably
    agree with you that they don't really compliment each other as best they might,
    or perhaps - again - it is a case of over designing it! \r\n\r\nFunnily enough
    I had considered putting part or all the logo into some container but couldn't
    really figure out a good way so I will play with using the leaf shape (which I
    did draw even with all the artistic skills of a 6 month old baby!) as that container
    and perhaps something with just the tree too.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your comments
    - I'll put something back up shortly. "

  body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nI have developed a couple more designs so please let me know
    what you think. \r\n\r\nI'm worried that the stalk of the leaf in the first one
    unbalances the logo. With regards to the other one I'm not sure if it is obviously
    a tree on the left (I know what the original looked like so can't detach myself
    from it so easily if you see what I mean). I think the second one looks more stylish
    but perhaps has less impact.\r\n\r\nHowever... that might be the least of it's
    problems - so please let me have your critiques? I can take it!\r\n\r\nMany thanks
    again.\r\n\r\nChris[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leaf_and_tree_concepts_5836.jpg]"

  body: "I agree \u2013 this is quite good stuff. Especially the top one seems strong
    and fresh. \r\nI'd probably move the \"Gardening\" down / away from the main icon
    a bit, and you may want to make it a little larger too, so it doesn't get lost
    at smaller sizes. The stalk could probably do with some polishing, but that's
    a pretty minor issue."

  body: "My only beef with it is the G read as a C at first glance. If you added a
    small serif to the inside of the G, it would improve readability a bit. It would
    also help the strength of the G at the end of gardening, as right now the \"NIN\"
    looks a bit awkward to me.\r\n\r\nI would also consider making the PG a lighter
    weight, as it seems to overpower \"gardening\" a bit too much as is."

  body: "Hola - thanks for the fontsquirrel.com recommendation. I was limiting my
    use to the default fonts on the Mac but that site looks excellent. I guess it
    could look a bit like broccoli but that contains lots of anti-carcinogens so maybe
    that's a good look?! ;-)\r\n\r\nAs it stands I have sent a couple of versions
    of the tree logo to the guy to see if he likes them. one with the full coloured
    tree and one with the outline swoosh. The leaf version feels a bit cumbersome
    and unbalanced but I do like the negative shapes made by the PG. \r\n\r\nThanks
    everyone for the input. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Consider how this will be reproduced. Like many location service contractors,
    gardeners are likely to apply the logo to their vehicle. Something that can be
    expressed as a solid single-color shape is easiest to implement in this way. In
    this regard, the black PG Leaf works best, in my opinion.
