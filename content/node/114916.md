body: "Hey guys, I'm a recent graduate and I've had this typeface in mind for some
  while now, finally got around to make some solid working prototypes of the lowercase
  letters. I'd like to call it sencillo, and this would be the roman or regular version
  of it. Any critique or feedback would be appreciated. Also I didn't take but two
  type classes and never really learned how to publish  a typeface, was wondering
  if anyone had any cost effective way to do so??[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sencillo_typeface_bw-500x297_5203.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sencillo_typeface-500x255_4618.png]"
