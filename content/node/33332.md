  for ages with my name, but to no avail. Getting a bit frustrated now.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  want to lend a little hand here? Drop us a line please.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    pretty good at it ;)\r\n\r\nOff of the top of my head I would like to ASSume that
    you probably cannot legibly and effectively produce an ambigram from any word.
    . . but I'm sure there are abstract arrangements that are somewhat equal. . . "

    character has to form its opposite, so you can use parts of one character to form
    parts of another in the opposite direction. But yes some combinations are impossible.\r\n\r\nTim"

    ways to approach them, and an infinity of lettering styles to draw from, it's
    just a matter of ingenuity. \r\n\r\nYou could also post your name and let the
    Typophiles take a swing at designing some for you. Could be fun all around. I
    love playing with ambigrams. "

  body: "Letterforms are infinitely malleable. If they weren't, we would run out of
    typefaces to design. Therefore, no ambigram is absolutely impossible. It's just
    a matter of how good it can be. Sometimes it will necessarily be bad.\r\n\r\nAnd
    one never stops learning new tricks with practice; there are requests that, had
    I received them only a few years ago, I would have turned away saying \"it's not
    going to be remotely legible or attractive,\" but are within my ability to make
    them so now. The last time I actually said \"I'll understand if you just want
    a refund\" was for BOOXTER, and even then they picked a sketch they liked enough
    to approve for completion.\r\n\r\nFeel free to look through <A HREF=\"http://ceruleanstimuli.com/ambigram/\">my
    ambigram gallery</A> for inspiration (or to commission me if you've given up,
    as I am still madly cheap).\r\n\r\n(new url. I didn't realize editing the reply
    would drop it to the end.)"
