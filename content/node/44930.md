body: "I work at an agency that has been around for over 21 years.  The current logo
  was developed 12 years ago.  The logo fits with our semi slogan \"Juggling Experts\"
  as we explain to our clients how we help them juggle the 4 P's of marketing.  This
  serves as an excellent metaphor and selling tool for our sales leads.  \r\n\r\nWe
  feel like the current logo does a decent job of conveying our whimsical/creative
  yet organized environment (e.g. our employees bring their dogs to work, and the
  dogs are free to roam the office, we're a little different from your typical agency).
  \ However, we are currently reviewing our logo to determine if an update is needed,
  considering the cost (easily $10K) to convert all of our material (business cards,
  web site, letterheads, etc.) to a new logo.  \r\n\r\nWe would like some more outside,
  honest opinions and reactions to our logo.  \r\n\r\nDoes it make you want to know
  more about our company?\r\nIf you didn't know what we do, what industry would you
  think we were in?\r\nWhat does it remind you of initially? \r\nDoes it seem up to
  date?  \r\nDoes it convey what we do?\r\nDoes it inspire intrigue or confusion?\r\nIs
  it too simple, silly, serious, corporate, common, or complicated?  \r\nWould it
  look better with a simple change in font or color scheme?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would love
  your thoughts, suggestions, and criticisms.  Should we keep it the same and save
  some serious cash?  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/dca_logo_5911.jpg]"

  body: "Just as a quick gut-reaction, I'd say the name is the bigger issue. I read
    DCA/DCPR as the focus which means absolutely nothing to me nor is it very memorable.\r\n\r\nI
    like the ball. Maybe emphasize that while downplaying the big acronym:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dc_5725.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    sample is just to show scale (ie, type was just slapped on there).\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I have no idea how much name recognition/equity you might already have in
    that acronym."

  body: "I agree that the acronym is a bit long, but I bet the clients, in and around
    his locale, have taken care of that. I.e. they probably have shortened it to DCA
    when they talk of their agency. When I started at a type house in 1981 the names
    we called customers did not even resemble their real identity. WE know, but how
    forthcoming is DA Design. It certainly is not obvious to the casual onlooker who
    DA is on first blush.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line for me is the letterforms. They are
    fun, but maybe a bit too fun. About 3 hours on the board, I am old fashioned,
    and you could lend some credibility to the forms and keep the playfulness but
    at the same time add some integrity to them. The colors... well the beach ball
    kind of dictates that unless you went with more mature colors... but does that
    defeat the purpose of the youth ethos?\r\n\r\nI am so tired of Agencies who use
    letterspaced, boring, tried and trued, over-used fonts for their ID. Have some
    fun if it is called for. That is my calligraphic slant coming out! But make it
    above reproach! \r\nMichael"

    underneath seem redundant.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if DCA means DC Advertising,
    looking at it now it reads as DC Advertising Advertising."

    in a positive or negative manner in different countries? At first glance, this
    logo looks like it would belong to a Jamaican beach resort. I like Aluminum''s
    idea of downplaying the dated acronym and putting more emphasis on the ball. '
