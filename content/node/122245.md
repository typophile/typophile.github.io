  body: "Great suggestions! Thank you kthomps5  and donshottype. I agree with you
    both that Font Mesa's Country Western Open is possibly the best match I'll find.
    I am beginning to think it is actually a true letterpress font.\r\nBut all of
    your suggestions are truly appreciated. Find-My-Font did not suggest CA Normal
    Serif Extra Bold or Consort ExtraBold CondensedRR. "
