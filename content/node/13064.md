  body: "Here a couple of quick impressions. I like it in general and it looks like
    a fun face to use - there are some things that I would consider tweaking \r\n\r\nthe
    'a' is so open that it starts to be hard to read. What about a straight line instead
    like the 'e'. The e is pretty sweet. P R & Z too.\r\n\r\nWhy is it spaced so tightly?
    I think these forms would do better with a bit more air between them.\r\n\r\nIn
    general I think I'd like the see just a little less roman feeling in this. I think
    it's there to give the face some teeth or sharpness The R with tail especially
    gives me that feeling. And the 7. I think they work well - although the R's longer
    tail seems a little weak to me. Maybe give it a bit more weight.\r\n\r\nBut some
    letters seem like they would be better off  a little softer or more whimsical.
    The W M H & T feel that way to me. The B is an example of a better hybrid I think.\r\n\r\nI
    could find more to say but that is what initially jumped out at me,\r\n\r\n"

  body: I've strengthened the R-tail a bit, and loosened the spacing a little, but
    otherwise I haven't changed much. Many of my friends, laymen though they may be,
    are very taken with this design, and I wouldn't want to turn it into something
    different. If anyone sees any fine details that bear correction, let me know soon,
    because I feel nearly ready to start selling it...

  body: "The new 'a' seems much improved to me. Overall things seem pretty dang sweet!
    Looking at the PDF this is what I am still wondering about:\r\n\r\na: maybe a
    slight additional reduction of the height of the bottom counter shape. Not key.
    It's nice as is too. You could raise the top arm a little as an over-shoot...
    Altrenate?\r\nb: there isn't one but it looks like there could be. - no biggie
    I suppose but it looks like it might be easy to have! I guess it could put pressure
    on the idea that there should be every other letter in LC though...\r\nJ; What
    about an altrenate j or even two? You could have a longer one to start but also
    looking at the K the top arm looks like something you could use to build an exciting
    altrenate bottom of a J. Sort of like the two Rs. See what I mean?\r\nP: What
    about an Open P altrenate like the R?\r\nS: What about an Altrenate? There are
    several letters in your font that have a fullness - the B, R, and a are examples
    - that I think might be brought into an Altrenate S. This comment applies to the
    Y too.\r\n\r\nThe connection of the 6's counter seems like it is too straight.
    9 too - what about making these open like the R.\r\n\r\nI think that Ampersand
    needs some work!\r\n\r\nOkay enouugh pummeling!\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

  body: "a: If I shorten the counter of the a, would that reduce or exacerbate the
    old-d appearance? Would eliminating the bend - making it more like 6 and 9 - help?
    Or open? I'm afraid I'm kind of attached to the a as it is, and the character
    of the whole face kind of hinges on it.\r\n\r\nb: Ascenders are not in the cards
    for this face, but I may try creating a complete normal duocase version of the
    face sometime.\r\n\r\nJ, P: Good ideas.\r\n\r\nS: I'm not sure what you mean by
    an alternate here. If the existing S lacks that quality, it should be changed.
    Raise the center?\r\n\r\n6, 9: I'll consider open, but might it work to curve
    inward more, rounding the counters?\r\n\r\nA note on alternates: I don't have
    the budget for Opentype capability. I have room for one alternate each where the
    capitals go.\r\n"

  body: "> a I don't want to say you have to change the 'a'. It is really good. I
    just have some ideas about what I might do to get a last bit of perfection into
    it. I could be wrong about each idea. I just haven't seen them & they did occur
    to me. You have to do what you think is best. It couldn't hurt to try these things
    ( i think...) - and I think subtle changes at most is what I have in mind. For
    an overshoot especially. Is there an overshoot already compared to the N?\r\n\r\n>
    b - fair enough!\r\n\r\n> J and P - cool.\r\n\r\n>S yeah. I think that would make
    it match the other letters' spirit better. You could also try it the other way
    I suppose. That aspect of the font is almost Art Nouveau. I guess it has things
    in common with illuminated letters too. Still there was alot of play in Art Nouveau
    that you could use to inspire altrenates!\r\n\r\n>6 and 9 Yeah inward curve would
    work work too. I do like your open shape since it gives you a chance to show offthe
    nice blade shape you have in some of the other characters. Either or both. Since
    it is a display face I think alternates would be way cool. And you have a basis
    for both versions being quite strrong.\r\n\r\n> altrenates - I was thinking about
    this too and my sugestion is that you build two fonts where some (but not all)
    charcters are altrenates and then bundle them. CuruleanA & CeruleanB or some such.
    This would give you up to 2 numerals & up to 4 letters. I can imagine having 4
    Rs for instance. That would be really cool. The R you have plus a long foot &
    maybe a stubby foot and maybe a lc r?\r\n\r\nAnyway, these are just suggestions..."

  body: "<A HREF=\"http://cerulean.st/ceruleansample.pdf\">Updated.</A> I think this
    subtle change fixes the a. All a-related glyphs have been revised to match. J,P,6,9
    done. Experimentation showed that there are good reasons to keep the balanced
    proportions of the S as they are; the top half just gets ugly.\r\n\r\nLimiting
    choices has as much importance to the utility of a font as giving choices. For
    instance, I tried adding n, and it poisoned the style of the whole face, so I
    removed it to prevent the possibility of someone using it. The end user is often
    not a typographer, and it's not always bad to make choices for them. Typodermic's
    <A HREF=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/soap/regular/\">Soap</A>, for
    comparison, has n but no N, because that's what works best for Soap. The only
    alternate, t, is tucked elsewhere in the character map so people don't use it
    by accident.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. A final question, assuming nobody else
    has opinions: Can you tell me what you don't like about the ampersand? I can tell
    it falls short of ideal somehow, but I can't figure out what's wrong with it."

  body: "This looks great! I really like the new P & J. I noticed this time was that
    now that all the other letters seem tight & right  - the bottom of the U might
    be moved down just a smidge - more like the e & the c which overshoot the baseline
    nicely. I don't know that it needs to go as far as those do - and I also know
    that it would mean (maybe) altering the R with the long arm so ...\r\n\r\nAlso
    - all the letters have a ton of spirit - but the cap Y seems just a little less
    exciting. You got so much feeling in the others but it seems like a little more
    in the Y would be good now. It worked really well in the P! The P looks great.\r\n\r\nThe
    Cap M & N have very similar widths. I wonder if the N wouldn't be better a little
    more narrow. It calls attention to itself because it is really roman in flavor
    & doesn't have the curves you have in the other letters. On the otheer hand an
    orthodox N is less wide than an M anyway. Look at Hoesfler's Ziggurat for instance.
    \ \r\n\r\nLooking at the sample of text at 50% I noticed that the leg on the Cap
    L seems a little long for even color in text. Maybe it could be shorter. Do you
    see what I mean? Not a lot but just a little. Take a look at some other faces
    - Copperplate is more like what you have but I would never set a sentence in copperplate.
    Emigre's Vendetta shows the effect I have in mind. \r\n\r\nLastly I think since
    it seems like you are feeling like you are done with the letterforms it's time
    to look at spacing & kerning. The word cerulean looks pretty good. The N seems
    a bit close to the a..but in general it seems good. The word sky looks a bit open
    to me though. Actually all the letters to the right of the A seem too close. Look
    at the spacing between the A&G vs O&N in dragon. See the uneveness? The Word 'Nouveau'
    looks quite good apart from the A&U.\r\n\r\nAbout the lc N idea. You should do
    what you think best. I can imagine a LC n working really well - your P & e give
    mme confidence it is possible. Also look at these maybe\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.net/type/shires.htm\r\n\r\nBut
    obviously - it's up to you!\r\n\r\nAbout the ampersand: I think your P has panache.
    It has flair. The current ampersand just kind of sits there. It doesn't look like
    it's ready to go ride a dragon like the rest of the face. It could be the coolest
    glyph of all! You could have 4 of them! I suggest that you design & redisign them
    based on a host of additional kinds of shapes. What for instance about and ampersand
    that looks like an 'et'?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: "The last one is the most convincing to me. But it's serif on the t in the
    et feels tacked on in this context. Is it a reversed serif from the other T? \r\n\r\nI
    imagine that there is more to try out. Each of the examples you posted looks like
    it is based on existing forms - maybe too much so. I wonder if you sketched out
    some new shapes with a pencil if you could get something even better.\r\n\r\nWhat
    if the '&' was taller and or deeper ( descending)  than the other glyphs? It's
    going to get used in titles like 'goblins & trolls' or 'meat & cheese' ( I am
    guessing ) so why not let it draw attention to itself with some extra height or
    depth ?\r\n\r\nCheck this out too\r\n\r\nhttp://store.adobe.com/type/topics/theampersand.html\r\n\r\nI
    would go through & look for the form you like best out of the many many that exist
    ( two in the font  would be way cool! ) and then start sketching. \r\n\r\nThere
    is huge potential for interest & character in the ampersand. \r\n\r\nSince this
    is a titling/display face it might be an important feature for sales puposes."

    ampersand. Traditional, but much more in the spirit of the face's round spaciousness.
    I would include all the others if I liked them, but I've realized I really don't.\r\n\r\nNotice
    also the new \"y\"."
