  fonts like this one http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/56135.html?1103546798
  or this one http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/54649.html?1101745648. also,
  if they're somehow minimalistic it's very cool.\r\n\r\ncould we make like a list
  of more such fonts in this thread? or is there already a list of such fonts somewhere?
  it's quite hard since none of them is linotype i think...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You can try generic terms (like rounded) on Myfonts.com, you will get a variety
    of fonts, some which you might expect and others that you expect don't appear,
    so you sometimes have to be creative with your search terms. Or you could try
    visiting specific foundry websites that you think might have a similar feel, for
    your examples I would look at T.26, Device, etc. You could have used the links
    on Typophile, but they seem to have gone walkabout in the revamp or are somewhere
    really obvious that I haven't looked.\r\nTim"
