  body: "I don't think Founders Grotesk is too different in sentiment than National,
    but it is more \"authentic\".\r\nI particularly like the way you've stuck with
    certain idiosyncrasies of the style, such as the small aperture of C, the big
    lean of the italic, and the roundness of S in the Bold Italic, without attempting
    to make \"improvements\"! Those are things I've always admired in 19th century
    grots, for their unusual quality."

    seem to be the preferred description for grots that get back the the pre-twentieth
    century? If these types were really authentic they would come with optical sizes,
    no small caps, limited punctuation, and a few completely botched letters in every
    font. I don\u2019t think that getting at the roots of the genre is really so much
    about authenticity as it is about getting away from the twentieth century tendency
    to iron out every last quirk and take harmony within families to extremes."

  body: "That's partly what I meant, and why I put \"authentic\" in quote marks.\r\n\r\nBut
    it's a question, really, of anachronism.\r\nFor instance, while National is strongly
    informed by the 19th century grotesque genre, it contains elements, such as ascenders
    that protrude above cap height, and \"l\" with tail, which one would not find
    in a 19th century sans. However, IMO (and without studying every glyph in great
    detail), Founders Grotesk is a revival with nothing \"out of time\". \r\n\r\n"
