body: "I'm looking to revitalize a client's logo. Right now they're using [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/english-111/vivace/|English
  111 Vivace]], but it needs new life. It's currently a wedding florals company, but
  is expanding to include other florals, as well as event production design (lounge
  furniture rentals, etc). Each division will have its own logo, as well, but the
  new parent logo should be energetic, not strictly weddingy (you know what I mean...),
  but still be recognizable to her current clientele, as she is well established in
  the wedding industry already. House Industries' revitalization of Agent Provocateur
  is a really good example of what I'm trying to do.\r\n\r\nAny font suggestions?
  I love Burgues Script and Compendium Script, but not sure if they're quite right.
  Plus my client thinks (on first viewing) that Burgues is too \"slanty\"...\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    at <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/50595\">this thread</a>. Have a look
    also at two new scripts from [[Stephen Rapp]] that are on the more handwritten
    end of the spectrum: <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/50595\">Memoir</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/50595\">Montague</a>.''\r\n\r\nIf
    they are looking for something less \"slanty\" and more upright, consider then

  body: "I showed her the Agent Provocateur before and after to give her an idea of
    the kind of energy that I want to give her logo, and she got really excited. She
    knows that her current, \"right out of the can\" is a little stale, but she still
    wants to keep the calligraphic, elegant look. I'm not sure that something uber-handwritten
    will really work... The normal slant of a script is okay with her, but she thinks
    that [[http://sudtipos.com/fonts/97|Burgues]] is too \"slanty\". I love it, I
    think it has just the energy that the logo needs, without breaking too far from
    her current logo. I also really like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/young-baroque/|Young
    Baroque]], but I think it might be a little too delicate. \r\n\r\nThanks so much
    for the suggestions! "

  body: "Young Baroque is indeed delicate. It needs to be set at a large size to perform
    well, something you can't promise with a logo that will appear in various sizes.
    In that vein, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/elsner_flake/ballantines_script_1_ot/\">Ballantines</a>
    might strike the right balance.\r\n\r\nIn the end, this is probably a job for
    a professional letterer who can get you the precise style, weight, and tone you
    need. I can recommend fellow Typophiles [[Michael Clark]] and [[Mark Simonson]]
    as well as [[Doyald Young]], the designer of Young Baroque."

  body: "Thanks for the reference Stephen, it is a monstrous deal to me to be recommended
    by a fellow typophile. I am up to my ass in alligators, but it is amazing to me
    that clients are not willing to pay for something that ultimately is their identity
    in absentia. I have always laughed at the people who have settled for the first
    and the last capital in their name being big, and the in-between small capitals
    with an underline, in a non descript font for their logo. I do not even try any
    more. Ignorance is the soup du jour. \r\n\r\nNo offense Cassie. They are not willing
    to pay for something that will last more than ten minutes. So they get what they
    pay for, no matter how far you, as a conscientious designer, are willing to go
    to give them YOUR absolute best. They do not care. But keep on trying!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nAny
    more all I can do is giggle as I drive by store fronts with logos designed by
    monkeys.\r\n\r\nMichael"
