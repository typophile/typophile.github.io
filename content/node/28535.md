  hate the \"e\" the most at the moment. \r\n\r\nComments welcome.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0hurt_6385.png]\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDavid"

  body: "You have quite a fun, jaunty sort of hybrid serif/ballpoint script font there.
    I see what you mean about the \"e\". Curving the horizontal bar to form the letter
    into a graceful spiral is my first guess at a solution, but that might divorce
    it further from the design of the rest of the letters. Adding a ball terminal
    to either end of the stroke might resolve that. \r\n\r\nThe hook of your \"t\"
    interferes with the \"m\". You could try having that dip a bit below the baseline
    to allow some space in those close kerning situations, but then you might see
    problems in the \"ty\" combo if you take it too far."

    its just for fun, so I couldn't really imagine that being a real ligature.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    I could upload a PDF file for better viewing next time?"

  body: "yes, please do post a PDF.\r\n\r\nThe image you ploaded does not compress
    well in the PNG format. You would have managed a much smaller file size with JPG,
    but with a sacrifice of quality. It's not as big a concern as it used to be, but
    there are still people out there with modems for whom file size is a factor in
    enjoyably viewing images on the web."
