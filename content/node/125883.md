body: "Hello, I\u2019m wondering if anyone is familiar with the subtle nuances between
  Palatino and Palatino Nova which is the modernized version of Palatino. I'm using
  Palatino for a project and am interested in tweaking it a bit and Palatino Nova
  would be perfect except it seems like the letterspacing on default is way more opened
  up than Palatino regular in a way I'm not so sure about. Obviously I could address
  that separately but something just seemed slightly off and there isn't much information
  about the font. Does anyone know anything about this?"

    the line beneath the samples that states there were no differences found, the
    two versions do differ\u2014as you've discovered. Besides the letter spacing issue,
    Nova's A has a higher crossbar and its Q a longer tail than the original Palatino,
    just to name two instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    off with the spacing in Nova? I've attached a one word comparison of the two.

    body: "Second one is better. (even if some kern pairs may lack) \r\nNicer more
      organic letter forms, wider (better) spacing. As Palatino standard is too narrow
      in my eyes."

  body: "Could it be that the online page does not show the fonts' kerning properly?
    (Or possibly just in your browser of preference.)\r\n\r\nThere are (at least :)
    three competing systems for kerning: TrueType's original <code>kern</code>, which
    is rather easily to implement and therefore quite well supported, Adobe's Type
    1 <code>.afm</code> based kerning (rare; proper Type 1 support seems rapidly dwindling),
    and finally, OpenType's <code>GPOS</code> tables - hard to implement correctly."

    is better for text.

    differences in the glyphs themselves are not that significant, but I do see some
    curvature in the stems. The serifs are a bit thinner (not good)."

  body: The "new and improved" Palatino is anything but. It is slightly lighter, the
    serifs are shorter, and overall the face has a softer feel to it. It is a pale
    imitation of Palatino.

  body: I'm definately not feeling nova as much as the original. I more liked the
    idea of the font being modernized than the reality. Yes, perhaps I should not
    judge the kerning based off a web preview. Does anyone suggest a font (not aldus)
    that would be a better Palatino replacement? Something with a more subtle nuanced
    modern flair but still classic.

  body: I'm guessing that the Nova is a text version of Palatino (essentially a display
    font) because Joe Shmoe is hooked on the "Palatino" name, and doesn't realize
    that Aldus is already the text version...

  body: "From top:\r\nPalatino 1950\r\nPalatino\r\nPalatino Nova\r\nAldus Roman\r\nAldus
    Roman Nova\r\n\r\nOne can see what a disaster the 'Nova' fonts are. The serifs
    and thin strokes of 'Palatino Nova' are noticeably thinner than the predecessor
    version, which was already hideous enough. What an abomination!\r\n\r\nNote the
    capital 'E' and 'F' in all five fonts. They have been narrowed in Palatino Nova,
    and widened in Aldus Roman Nova. What? Also, note how the crossbars in the E and
    F in the original Palatino 1950 and Aldus Roman are not at the same height (the
    crossbar of 'F' is lower). This is to achieve a better 'balance' in the 'F'. The
    crossbar of 'F' in both Novas is even with that of the 'E'. What an abortion!
    How can these idiots put out such crap? Also, the diagonal stroke of 'Z' and 'z'
    should be thin (as it is in Palatino 1950 and Trajanus), not thick. The stress
    is nearly vertical in Palatino Nova, much like that of Aldus Roman. The ascenders
    of Aldus Nova are shorter than those of Aldus Roman, and the characters of Aldus
    Nova are all wider. \r\n\r\nOverall, the changes make Aldus and Palatino more
    similar. What idiocy!\r\n"
