  it? Obviously the basics will be there, sans or serif etc., but how much detail
  do you go into? Do you know in advance how much contrast you want, what sort of
  terminals you want, or does most of that come as you work? I know this probably
  differs for everyone, but I''d be interested to see where the common ground - if
  any - lies.'

    in my case, it usually started after designing some letters for a logo and decided
    to draw the rest of the character set.\r\n\r\nMy priority is to make the glyphs
    look good at display size and well-spaced using it's normal sidebearings, with
    kerning pairs as minimum as possible. I have never designed a text face. :)"

  body: I usually have a brief from the client, which may involve some technical constraints
    and a more or less tightly identified target usage. But the brief seldom specifies
    the actual style of the typeface, so within the constraints of the brief the first
    thing I start thinking about is the overall look and feel of the type, what a
    block of text will look like.

  body: "In my limited experience:\r\n\r\nI usually start from one or two characters
    that have been sketched in my notebook or on a scrap of paper (or sometimes a
    shape that emerged playing in Illustrator. So, I have this one character, and
    I start building around it. As I make more characters, I might realize that the
    weight of the stems has to change. Nothing is set from the beginning and the glyph
    that started it all might not even make it into the finished design.\r\n\r\nI
    do try to pin down the details as quickly as possible, so as not to have to redraw
    glyphs too often."

    typographer. I make type just for my personal pleasure. I don't turn every logotype
    I've designed into a typeface, of course.\r\n\r\nI'm not talking about creating
    a wide family of text face overhere, just another silly looking typeface you could
    find scattered on the internet. Being staggered is really unnecessary. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@russelm\r\n\r\nThe
    answer is 'yes' if you're asking to curious peoples like me. :)"

    I tend to over-think concepts and have trouble actually getting started. That
    said, I do think it's a good thing to have at least a semi-solid concept before
    starting out &ndash; at least basic things like intended use / target point size,
    serif size/shape (if applicable), basic proportions, and something like the \"feel\"
    the whole thing should have. \r\nBut I'm just starting out designing type, so
    this process is still very much under construction (and will likely remain so
    for the years to come ;-) )."

    very different than what I end up with. I start with a trope or gimmick (which
    can include, and is not limited to, contrast, ductus, serif shape, &c.) but as
    I carry it through it just doesn't work the way I thought it would, which leads
    me in new directions I hadn't considered previously.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, so far most of my fonts have been more of a weekend or two scope.\r\n\r\nI've
    been working on one whole typeface (something appropriate for hobbits, is my current
    opinion) that has pan-European glyph coverage, regular, bold and italic fonts
    and it all stated with a capital 'H' I doodled on the metro one day.\r\nI mean,
    you have to start somewhere, and for me- designing type without a brief, it starts
    in my notebooks. I don't think I have anything significant to add to the world
    of text fonts yet, so for me- the more ambitious project I've undertaken- which
    may last a year, has mostly been an exorcise undertaken to learn all the parts
    that need to go into a complete typeface and to try and work out an efficient
    workflow (hint: not the way I've been working) "
