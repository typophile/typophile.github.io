  body: "You're probably right about this is not fully custom. It's probably the same
    font as the baseline \"software\", simply edited (removing upper parts of vertical
    stems and /a spur) but really too small to be identified (at least to me). Could
    be a lot of thing including Helvetica (not so hard to reproduce it using it).
    The easiest way would probably to ask directly [[http://www.behance.net/crtomirjust9b11|\u010Crtomir
    Just]].\r\nHere, you could find a list of fonts with spurless /a (same vein as
    the edited \"promana\"): [[http://typecache.com/font-clusters/04/|Typecache]]"
