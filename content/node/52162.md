  \r\nEnglish is not my mothertongue and this could be the reason for my ignorance.\r\nI
  have tried to pick up the meaning of this proverb, that I have seen used a few times
  now. i.e. in the title of Erik Spiekermanns book 'Stop stealing sheeps and find
  out how type works'. And in Robert Bringhursts book 'Elements of typographic style'
  -(letterspacing is like stealing sheeps). In my confusion I have searched on Google
  to find an explanation, but without luck. That's why I have come to you guys!\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone help me explain this apparently well-known (typographic?) proverb? \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\nJacob"

    would letterspace blackletter would steal sheep.\" Although it is commonly misquoted
    as \"Anyone who would letterspace lower case would steal sheep.\"\r\n\r\nI can't
    remember why, I think someone gave him an award with letterspaced blackletter
    that he did not like."

  body: "OK! So I guess one could translate it into: Letterspacing lowercase(/blackletter)
    is bad typography manners?\r\n\r\nThank you! "

  body: "From what I understand Goudy said that anyone letterspacing blackletter would
    be the kind of person who'd pull a Gill on the poor sheep. \r\nAs we don't use
    blackletter much these days and the reference to zoophilia would steal the focus
    from the typographic lesson to be learned, a cleaned up version is now the common
    one."

  body: The Stop Stealing Sheep book tells the story, if I remember correctly. The
    original verb Goudy used was <em>shag</em>. And also of note, letterspacing blackletter
    was a established way of adding emphasis. But yeah, bad manners is the implied
    meaning.

    to Gill's zoophilia in that sentence or...? "

    publicly known.
