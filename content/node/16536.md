body: "I've been looking for a good directory of typefaces, categorized by Type Historical
  (or at least Art Historical) period, e.g. (Baroque, Neoclassical, etc). There are
  so many directories, guides and books, but all of them seem to be categorized by
  style (Blackletter, Serif, etc), not period. I have seen small historical guides,
  such as the four-pager in Bringhurst's EOT, but none as comprehensive as I'd like.
  Has an authoritative historical directory managed to elude me?\r\n\r\nEven better,
  perhaps there's a list of <cite>all</cite> the authoritative type manuals and guides?
  I checked the Typowiki, but the book listing definitely leaves much to be desired
  at this point."

    Textism sure is pretty though! ;-)"

  body: "<em>An Atlas of Typefaces</em> by James Sutton and Alan Bartram is good if
    you can find it. It is a survey of current (as of the 1980s) typefaces presented
    historically, with historical examples.\r\n\r\n<em>Art of the Printed Book</em>
    is pretty good, but is not about typefaces per se."

  body: "You could combine Lewis Blackwell's \"20th Century Type Remix\" with D.B.
    Updike's \"Printing Types\" (although he's a bit light on the 19th century).\r\nBut
    really, this sounds like a Wiki project: a database of typeface info which could
    be sorted by font name, designer, foundry, country, or year. Or even type category.

  body: A database like that would be truly amazing. My design team is always brining
    me work with bizarre pairings, such as a 20th Century Modernist headline with
    Baroque text. Not that such anachronisms are necessarily <cite>wrong</cite>, but
    I encourage everyone to think of type in a historical context which, IMHO, creates
    a "setting" just as an novelist wouldn't put a wristwatch on a fictional Renaissance
    philosopher.

    seem to be making a gesture in that direction, even if it's not quite there yet."
