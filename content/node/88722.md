  type is used for the music group Melic. The image is below or you can visit the
  website where it is more clear at http://www.melicband.com/index.htm\r\n\r\nI don't
  know any details about the font or where it could have possibly come from but I
  do know the band has been going for only about two years.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in
  advance.\r\n"
