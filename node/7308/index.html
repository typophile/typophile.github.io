Communications are clear, not just cleaver. So be clear first then, cleaver. Those are some nice clients and all corporations you might want to create something more upscale.

For example, it could represent fast turnaround, response time, driving your message to your target, always moving forward, and so on.

		<div class="commentbody">As others have said, toss all of them but variation #1. <BR> <BR>Version 01 reminds me of nautical flags/sports wear. I understand the &lt; shape and the K being similar, but I can't stop thinking of Nautica and Tommy Hilfiger. It's also the navy blue and red with white type. I prefer the version on the business card, because the blue arrow doesn't show. <BR> <BR>I'd use V01 as a start and explore type, like Scott said. Copperplate Gothic (that's what you're using, right?) is a solid face, but it's got a dated look and is used by a lot of novice designers and pseudo-designers who pull their type from the default menus. Again, it's not <i>bad</i> per se, but an agency of that size and breadth should use a more exclusive, 'designer's favorite' typeface. The style of Copperplate works, but another face could work much better. Because the logo is abstract geometry, the type provides a lot of the communication and message. <BR> <BR>Also, the arrow shapes are pointing to the left, which signifies (for me, as an American) rewinding or going backwards. <BR> <BR>Keep exploring, and good luck.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Knockout D could be good, it's very strong, etc. But I'd probably choose faces of a different sort. Though, your explorations generally show that the typeface may not be the issue. <BR> <BR>Look at #1 and #1b, for example. They are both using generally the same shapes with different typefaces. Then look at the other three. I don't see what they're all trying to do for Kres. I think you have some more fundamental explorations to do before taking them to such a polished level (color, type, kerning, etc.). All of the logos say something, but they all don't say anything specific enough for my tastes. You are constructing a series of completed logos, but I don't detect a strong visual theme. I'm not implying you're not doing a good job, or working hard, but you seem to be firing in the dark at your target. What's happening is that you're making the mark equally important to the type, without a strong connection between them, or a smooth coexistance. I like 2 and 4 because 2 allows the mark to take over and 4 makes the graphic mark and type come together. The symbol in 1 and 1b is cool, but the type isn't tied in (or as interesting as the mark). For that mark, I'd avoid serifs completely. Additionally, you could move 'advertising' over to the left and extend the bottom ovoid shape in 1b down to cover the 'ad' in 'advertising' instead of using a new circle. Or even use the bottom leg of the K to do that. Not sure if that'll work. <BR> <BR>If you go with the #1b mark (I prefer it to #1), try <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/cyclone/index.html">Cyclone</a> or <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=NEUTRAFACE-FO&amp;sub=inuse">Neutra</a>, or maybe <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=CHALOBLI-FO&amp;sub=view">Chalet</a>. Something simple and strong, but with a slight European, hip twist or curve. You can probably see I'm going with condensed faces generally. Take a risk. And these are just my first few suggestions. I chose them because I looked at your client list and thought: global, dynamic, hip but not trendy, contemporary, elegant but not elderly or historic. Look to the younger, and/or hipper font houses, also the independents (do a search on this board, or buy <a href="http://www.p22.com/indiefonts/">Indie Fonts</a>). Step a bit further outside of the norm. <BR> <BR>I also agree with Scott's statements about keeping the K more apparent if you use the echelon shapes from the original variation 1. <BR> <BR>I can see you know the general feeling you want. Keep pushing. Hope this helps.</div>

I think that I could play a little bit with the kerning and the Sans and Serif interplay. However, I didn't perceive what you said about the font and the illustration. Do you suggest to use a sans serif font for the head (if so, would Frutiger or Officina Sans be a  <BR>good choice?). <BR> <BR>To Chris : I think that Cyclone is a little too radical for my taste.

		<div class="commentbody">I'd keep the type outside of the oval. It doesn't sit right with me. Also, I prefer the circle to the oval, but I don't have a strong reason for that preference. <BR> <BR>The pricetag idea seems more shopping oriented, but if you and the client like it, then keep going. Close up the word space between 'advertising' and 'agency'. <BR> <BR>&quot;<i>I have tried some of the major sans fonts (Helvetica, Futura, AvantGarde, Gill sans, etc.), but I don't see how that font choice could contribute to the overall logo image.</i>&quot; <BR> <BR>Well, that's a problem.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>The font choice is extremely important. The design of the letterforms can evoke associations and emotional reactions that have to do with a variety of factors. Try putting Bodoni or Centaur by the logo, then use Officina or Scala Sans. The logo mark you've designed doesn't really say anything specific, so the associations could be very wide and different. The type helps to clarify the image. <BR> <BR>Here are a few quick versions I threw together that are loosely in the direction I was thinking. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52477.gif" alt="KRES logo examples"> <BR> <BR>These examples use Scala Sans Bold and Caps. The condensed faces didn't look as good as I thought they would. I think the simplicity is the important part here. Also, the font is a modern and clean sans, but humanist in some of its construction. That softens the impression a bit and lets the san serif feel more at home with a mark that's so curved. It's <i>all</i> about the type choice, in my opinion.</div>
