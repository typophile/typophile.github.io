  body: "Hot off the presses, we're pleased to announce an Exclusive NEW release from
    Crystal Kluge of the Tart Workshop, Nelly Script and Nelly Script Flourish. .
    .\r\n\r\nNelly is a beautiful yet sensible romantic, clearly hand drawn but easy
    to read.  She\u2019s a bit formal but not stuffy and simply adores a lovely party.
    \ A perfect choice for invitations and announcements, especially those of the
    romantic nature. Nelly Script comes complete with a handful of alternate lowercase
    forms in OpenType format.\r\n\r\nSometimes you need to gild the lily, add a little
    drama, bling. With that in mind we\u2019ve created a collection of flourishes
    & embellished letters to enhance Nelly Script\u2019s romantic appeal.  Nelly Script
    Flourish is the jewelry to a beautifully appointed lady, the icing to the wedding
    cake, the VaVoom! Nelly Script Flourish comes complete with a large variety of
    alternate upper and lowercase forms in OpenType format.\r\n\r\nYou can see both
    of these amazing new scripts at: http://www.fontbros.com/tartworkshop_new.php"
