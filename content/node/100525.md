  catch is it has to have been created by an Italian type designer.\r\nAnother option,
  has Akzidenz been redrawn by an Italian type designer in some shape or form? \r\nIf
  there are any other suggestions of similar typefaces that are Italian in origin
  I would be most grateful to here your thoughts.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nSimon"

  body: An Italian type designer friend of mine was planning to embark on an AG revival,
    and went as far as to gather a large quantity of reference material, which they
    put in a heavy metal box, placed somewhat precariously on a high shelf. They never
    got around to the redesign, so it literally remains an Akzidenz waiting to happen.
