body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gros_Canon_Romain_units_6160.jpg]\r\n\r\nSince
  2007 I am doing a PhD research at Leiden University, of which the title is <em>Harmonics,
  Patterns, and Dynamics in Formal Typographic Representations of the Latin Script
  | The regularization, standardization, systematization, and unitization of roman
  type since its Renaissance origin until the Romain du Roi</em>. Over time I have
  posted some info on my research on this forum, and now there is a <strong><a href=\"http://www.lettermodel.org\">dedicated
  blog</a></strong> with related fragments, mostly presented as \u2018notes on\u2019.
  \r\n\r\nThe question on which my research is meant to \uFB01nd an answer, is whether
  \u2013and if so, to which extent\u2013 the harmonics, patterns, and dynamics of
  formal grapheme systems in use to represent the Latin script since the invention
  of movable type, are the result of standardizations and systematizations of the
  production process of Renaissance printing type (centuries before documented regularizations
  were applied on the Romain du Roi).\r\n\r\nThis research comprises some controversial
  aspects, because it questions the myhical \u2018eye\u2019 of the type designer.
  The skills of type designers have been mysti\uFB01ed since the early days of punch-cutting.
  For instance Pierre Simon Fournier emphasized the role of the \u2018eye\u2019 in
  his <em>Manuel Typographique</em> from 1764\u20131766, when he criticized the attempts
  of Jaugeon and his colleagues to standardize the design of the Romain du Roi: \u2018<em>These
  gentlemen would have been well advised to a single rule which they established,
  which is chie\uFB02y to be guided by the eye, the supreme judge [\u2026].\u2019</em>
  But my measurements of French Renaissance type from the inventory of the Museum
  Plantin-Moretus in Antwerp seem to provide ample proof for the hypothesis that the
  structures and patterns of roman type \uFB01nd their origin for a large part in
  standardizations of the production process of movable type during the early days
  of typography. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LetterModel_strokes_1_5963.gif]\r\n\r\nMy
  research also questions to which extent handwritten letters played a role in the
  development of roman type. Is it possible that the writing models currently in use
  to educate the basics of type design, which are often related to Edward Johnston\u2019s
  \u2018Foundational hand\u2019, and used to prove that roman type \uFB01nds its origin
  in the patterns and structures of writing, actually show a standardization that
  was the result of the production process of the archetypes by Nicolas Jenson and
  Francesco Griffo? If this turns out to be the case, then the writing models are
  used for circular logic.\r\n\r\nCurrently the site index contains:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1

    \u2014 following the beat.\r\nIt\u2019s easier to write to a steady rhythm, just
    as it is easier to create a mechanical system of interchangeable parts according
    to standardized units of measurement.\r\nPerceptually, too, a regular grid provides
    a benchmark or matrix against which variations acquire significance.\r\n\r\nThese
    general considerations of regularity precede any deterministic effects related
    to specific technologies."

    I know about modern lingustics theory - Chomsky's notion of \"deep structure\"
    - and it's counterpart in musical tonality made possible by the twelve-tone \"well-tempered\"
    tuning system.\r\nBottom line: I might be missing something, but why would the
    \"eye of the designer\" lead somewhere other than the way the technology would
    ordinarly tend to evolve over time in the hands of technicians? Is there a mutual
    exclusivity that I'm missing?\r\n\r\nCould it not be that the \"eye\" is not mythical?
    That it exists in the DNA of both designer and technician?"
