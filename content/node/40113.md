  body: Thats it! Thank you very much Florian R. Looks like the Comsat is no longer
    available. A waste for such a cool font! All search links lead to a fonts.com  error
    page. Even tracked down the designer but he is not selling the font personally.  If
    anyone knows another alternative it would be much appreciated. Thanks again.
