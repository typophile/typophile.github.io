body: In a grotesque typeface styled after British designs from the late nineteenth
  and early twentieth centuries, would anyone actually want to have the too-dark and
  about to fall over S, or would you rather see it replaced with a more continental
  design?

    be?

  body: "This is the British style S that I\u2019m referring to. I get the impression
    that this style turned up in Britain late in the nineteenth century. Some similar
    stuff turns in America (ATF Lining Gothic) but the British version is just so
    unbalanced it\u2019s kind of funny.\r\n\r\nI think I\u2019ll make it an alternate.

  body: Those are pretty dreadfully executed for what I'd imagine they were trying
    to do, but it does have a charm. The lc is especially wonky. If the inconsistencies
    were more consistent, it could succeed in a modern context and have a feel that
    not a lot of sans faces accomplish.

  body: "Check out the history of Maple, from Process Typefoundry. When Eric Olson
    revisited his Process Grotesque (a fairly faithful adaptation of the British grots),
    the s was one of the characters that changed significantly.\r\n\r\nhttp://processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/maple/info.html"

  body: Thanks for the link, Marc. My project is very similar; a mashup of the Stephenson
    Blake grotesques and 19th century poster lettering with the contrast cranked up
    beyond Franklin Gothic. The SB types are a strange mix of fabulous and disastrous
    but so fun to jump off from.

  body: "James, I don't think you're seeing this right.\r\nYou had a similar problem
    with the S in Recovery.\r\nThis is the way the S is supposed to look in this style,
    if you're doing a fairly close revival.\r\nTry and keep the personality and balance
    it according to your eye (use drag skew tool), rather than departing from the
    model entirely.\r\nBTW, the SB grots are distinctive and British, but not typically
    British, as there were other sans faces at the time that weren't so funky."

    not doing a revival so much as sifting through a pile of fonts and letting for
    things that work and trying to find a mix that work together. As fun as my various
    sources are, none of them presents a compelling target for a revival, but a remix
    seems like a nice possibility."

  body: The S isn't fugly! It's sitting back and smiling! I suspect the road you're
    traveling down (Mash Up Blvd) is going to end in extreme frustration, as what's
    working in one alphabet most likely won't work well in another.

  body: I guess sitting back and smiling is another way to look at it. Maybe the smile
    is from a few gin & tonics.
