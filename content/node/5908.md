  body: '&#62; appropriate letter space is a function not only of absolute distance,
    <BR>&#62; but also of the ratio of the width of the counters to the letter space.
    <BR> <BR>Yes, but for a given font you can just vary the letterspacing, leaving
    the individual letters unchanged&#42;, thereby basically testing the degree to
    which proximity is conducive to readability. It&#39;s a superb test of which theory
    is better. <BR> <BR>&#42; Unlike making the whole setting wider, which increases
    both the letterforms -with their internal spaces- and the letterspacing proportionally,
    thus maintaining the balance you speak of. And although testing readability changes
    affected by width/narrowness would be interesting, it&#39;s more complex &#40;because
    of the need to normalize against apparent size, apparent leading and economy&#41;
    and the results less directly relevant. <BR> <BR>&#62; at text sizes ... the counters
    and letter spaces are more near the limits of vision. <BR> <BR>Well, I guess they&#39;re
    close than in display setting, but there&#39;s still so far from the resolution
    limits of human vision that I don&#39;t see that mattering. <BR> <BR>&#62; The
    problem is that if you space a circular sans more widely then the words can &#39;fall
    apart&#39;. <BR> <BR>This is effectively bouma theory; loose spacing reduces the
    bonding between letters; and serifs help the bonding. <BR> <BR>&#62; fatigue <BR>
    <BR>As far as I know, Kevin sees a total correspondence between reading speed
    and reading comfort - and so do I. And as far the reader&#39;s consciousness is
    concerned the point is actually more often reading comfort &#40;preventing a reader
    from aborting a reading effort&#41;, not how quickly a reader can finish a reading
    effort. <BR> <BR>&#62; catch misspellings <BR> <BR>The more immersed you are,
    the more you&#39;ll miss mistakes, because the &#34;assumptive&#34; mechanisms
    bypass superficial mistakes - although sometimes they also miss important distinctions
    - hence regressions. <BR> <BR>&#62; Why would an author, or poet, care about &#34;read
    speed&#34;. <BR> <BR>First of all an author wouldn&#39;t generally care about
    typographic reading performance &#40;although he might very well care to make
    his writing easy to grasp - or not - it depends on the intentions&#41;. But anyway
    there are many more people than just authors and poets, fortunately. And one group
    of people are typographers, who should care about reading comfort/performance,
    not least because the work being read isn&#39;t the most important thing in the
    reader&#39;s life &#40;much to the chagrin of the author/poet...&#41; and to a
    great extent the reader wants to finish what he starts, and he doesn&#39;t want
    to suffer because the typographer doesn&#39;t get readability. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    What about shorter movies, shorter symphonies?  <BR> <BR>If you use a font with
    low readability, yes, you better make your stuff shorter. <BR> <BR>&#62; Speed
    is not the message. <BR> <BR>Usually. But it&#39;s very often the fuel. Most humans
    want to live and they want to live intensely = quickly. They want to do something,
    and then do something else. And those who don&#39;t, we can&#39;t help with more
    readable type anyway. Speed isn&#39;t for everybody, all of the time. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: My wife reads a chapter from a novel every night in bed before falling asleep.  She
    has done this all her life.  I don&#39;t think she is in a hurry to finish her
    chapter.  She finds the act of reading relaxing and uses it as a way to segway
    into sleep.  That is not to say that she is the model for the majority.  I am
    just making a case for a broader spectrum of reading comfort than just imersive
    and non-imersive.  If I am reading a text book or a software manual, I skim and
    skip until I find the little kernal I am interested in and then slow down and
    read intently. <BR>I take much longer to read James Joyce than I do Hemingway--not
    because it is just more difficult reading but because there is a heck of a lot
    more content in a Joyce sentence.  I think what designers and typographers need
    to study as well as just readability is motivation and a much larger set of reading
    categories to match them. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    a primo typographic comfort issue to me. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m
    the first to say that high readability isn&#39;t always important, and there are
    indeed many other things to consider&#42;. But sometimes it is pretty important,
    and the only negative of making fonts with high readability is the &#34;expense&#34;
    on the part of a type designer in simply grasping readability. It only takes knowledge
    to do a <i>better</i> &#40;never the ultimate&#41; job, not any other resource.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; Clearly each of us gets his kicks considering one thing or another.
    There&#39;s no point harping on somebody because he&#39;s interesting in pushing
    readability a few percent and only under certain conditions. At least it&#39;s
    useful to some people sometimes. For my part I see a problem with designers overly
    worried about the formalisms in their text fonts for example. Who does that benefit

  body: Most of the history of text typefaces has been, in fact, the history of book
    typefaces. Prior to the 20th century, there seems to have been very little thought
    given to the design of text type that was not bibliocentric. This is a general
    and rather obvious observation, but I think it is useful to consider this as we
    talk about the experience of reading. In our information-rich age we are surrounded
    by all sorts of &#39;texts&#39; that are informational rather than literary, and
    type design has adapted to this but largely by feeling its way out of the book
    and into new media. Only in the area of signage has there been much emphasis put
    on empirical testing of readability. <BR> <BR>Rather that contrasting text and
    display faces, we might find it more useful to try to identify different kinds
    of text faces, and talk about suitability to different kinds of reading experiences.

    others &#40;memos for work&#41;? How do we read things we hate thinking about
    &#40;tax forms&#41;? How do we read ads vs. poetry? How do we read tabular material
    vs. paragraphs?  Beyond that, what  about reading as opposed to communication?

  body: Claudio, <BR>Din was initially done as a signage face &#40;and perhaps for
    OCR?&#41; but I quite like it as text.  To me, it works quite well when setting
    modern technical documents since it feels very precise and self-assured.  I know
    I am going to get a big batch of hate mail and ridicule for what I am about to
    say now but I will say it anyway.  I think it is truly beautiful. To me, It captures
    the essence of today&#39;s technology and makes me feel quite comfortable with
    it.  I also have set my resume in FF Din &#40;waiting for the rain of bullets
    from other Typophilers&#41;. I often use it for tabular material, screen presentations,
    charts and graphs, even for my daughter&#39;s book cover. <BR>Futura is a different
    story.  I can&#39;t use it in text at all.  The very round glyphs with the narrow
    verticals are too uneasy for me.  That may be purely my own aesthetic sense at
    work though. I do use it frequently for display--mostly just the capitals though.
    I also think the capitals are quite beautiful and should be in a type hall of
    fame if there ever is such a thing.  I don&#39;t have a certain genre of material
    to suggest for Futura since it lends itself to many things. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: Claudio, <BR>I would love to see your font!  I will email you as you requested.
    <BR>Regarding the condensed--I think because the full width had a signage basis,
    it is more open and spaced wider than is best for text. To my eye, the open space
    in the counters and the loose fit can get a bit overshadowing and start to break
    up the wordshape.  The FF version is better suited for text and the condensed
    version draws a better word shape.  I feel to optimize Din for text, it would
    be best to draw a slightly condensed version of the FF Din full width, not as
    condensed as the actual condensed since this would not work as well at smaller
    sizes. <BR> <BR>Regarding the Greek--I find this a fasinating coincidense.  All
    of my ancesters are from Greece.  I am second generation American and spoke Greek
    as a child.  I can&#39;t wait to see your Greek version.  I also find the typical
    roman versions of Greek to be somehow un-Greek.  They look like an English or
    American scholar&#39;s vision of what Greek ought to be. I feel that Greek makes
    much more sense as a sans. By the way, your friend Panos&#39;s last name sounds

  body: 'I&#39;ve been doing some reading about reading speed the last few days. Some
    meta comments first. While some people may choose to read slower because they
    are particularly enjoying the content, this is a rare state when you are actually
    thinking about the process of reading while reading &#40;analogous to thinking
    about breathing - you can do it, but most of the time it just happens&#41;. Studies
    by James Sheedy at OSU and others report positive correlations between reading
    speed and decreased visual fatigue. When people read similar content with either
    good or poor typographic quality, the good typographic quality text will be read
    faster and with less visual fatigue. Reading is a gating faster. We can think
    faster than we can read, but the mechanical process of moving our eyes and absorbing
    the text prevents us from reading faster. <BR> <BR>Which leads us to speed reading
    classes. There are several groups &#40;at least in the US&#41; that will teach
    students to read faster. They typically promise to double or triple your reading
    speed. Students who complete these seminars are usually quite satisfied. Just,
    Carpenter, and Mason &#40;1982&#41; measured the reading speed, comprehension,
    and eye movements of a group of successful speed readers and a group or normal
    readers. They found that their normal readers read Scientific American articles
    at a rate of 250 wpm while the speed readers read at a rate of nearly 700 wpm.
    The eye movements for these two groups differed greatly. While both groups read
    in the typical left to right, top to bottom direction, the speed readers had shorter
    fixations on a word and longer saccades with greater numbers of skipped words.
    <BR> <BR>While this sounds good for the speed readers, the tradeoff is that their
    comprehension was much poorer. On comprehension questions that has to do with
    the gist or the article, both groups were successful, but on questions that were
    more details, only the normal readers could answer them. Further analysis showed
    that if an eye fixation was not made on the detail asked about, the reader would
    not know the answer. <BR> <BR>In a second part of the study, the researchers asked
    the normal readers to skim to attempt to finish an article in the same time as
    the speed readers. The normal readers had not been trained in speed reading techniques,
    but showed remarkable similarity to the speed reading group. Their reading rate
    increased to 600 wpm, their fixation times decreased, the saccade length increased,
    and their comprehension decreased. <BR> <BR>While I believe there is a strong
    correlation between the amount of time you have spent reading in your life and
    your reading speed, the evidence is fairly conclusive that it is not possible
    to read faster than 400 wpm without surrendering comprehension. <BR> <BR>Different
    topic: I agree that the hypothesis that letter space should be proportional to
    counter space is an interesting one, and one that I will include in my research.
    I think the best way of doing this is to look at the optimal letterspacing over
    several fonts expecting to find that fonts with larger counters need larger letterspace?

    What were the exact testing conditions? The reading experience of the readers,
    the typography, and the testing environment? Also, explicitly asking people to
    perform much better than they&#39;re used to can often backfire. <BR> <BR>Now,
    I&#39;m not saying that everybody can read in &#34;deep immersion&#34; all of
    the time - and some people maybe never. But what I am saying is that making fonts
    in a certain way will allow some people to read in deeper immersion more often.
    This is the category of reading that I believe has not been properly measured
    yet. <BR> <BR>But I certainly agree that &#34;speed reading&#34; is bogus. They
    can even go much higher than 6-700 wpm. But I also think that pushing people who
    normally read a given type of material at 250 wpm to suddenly more than double
    their speed cannot work: they simply don&#39;t have the experience, the store
    of boumas and the &#34;firmware&#34; to use them at speed. They don&#39;t have
    the practice to guess well deep into the parafovea. I believe it takes many man-months
    of reading immersively &#40;and good testing conditions&#41; for a subject&#39;s
    ability to saccade deeply -while preserving comprehension- to register on the
    lab radar. <BR> <BR>So how do you measure what I&#39;m talking about? <BR>Choose
    your subjects, and your stimuli, properly, and <i>then</i> push. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    look at the optimal letterspacing over several fonts expecting <BR>&#62; to find
    that fonts with larger counters need larger letterspace? <BR> <BR>This seems like
    a distraction. The more useful thing to find out first is simply what the optimal
    letterspacing is for a good conventional text font, like maybe Adobe Minion&#42;.
    When you show the results to typographers, that will immediately tell you to what
    extent the empirical and anecdotal worlds are misaligned. BUT the test will only
    be relevant if you push as deep as possible into true immersion, otherwise it
    will simply be a self-fulfilling prophesy, simply another illusional validation
    of the half-world of the letterwise model. <BR> <BR>&#42; Noting that a multiple-master
    font &#40;if you can still find Minion in that incarnation - it shouldn&#39;t
    be too hard though&#41; can be very useful in readability testing. For example
    you can choose instances of different widths and weights, within the bounds of
    anecdotal beliefs concerning quality. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    subjects, and the stimuli? <BR> <BR>&#62; it is Not Possible to recognize letters
    very far outside of the fovea. <BR> <BR>Well, exactly! And this is why boumas
    matter. I believe that -aided by the semantic context of the phrase- frequently
    ocurring clusters of letters with distinctive envelopes <i>can</i> be recognized
    far from the fovea - and why would the brain pass up the opportunity to recognize
    them &#40;if it&#39;s pushing performance&#41;? Maybe the readers in that test
    lost comprehension simply because they need more practice and/or the typography
    was not conducive to deep immersion - is that crazy? Even assuming good typography,
    maybe they need to improve their guesswork - just like a race car driver can make
    increasingly better instantaneous decisions about how to pass a car the more he
    has experience doing it. He certainly doesn&#39;t do it through conscious analysis
    - he does it through the low-level instinctive &#34;firmware&#34; which has evolved
    in him over time. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know who the onus is on to do what -certainly
    I&#39;m not getting paid by anybody- but I do believe that a researcher who is
    truly concerned should be open-minded, and simply try to find something that <i>might</i>
    exist. You can&#39;t really falsify results by doing so - at most you will find
    nothing. And you shouldn&#39;t be looking for boumas because I said so, but because
    so much anecdotal evidence &#40;such as the importance of tight letterspacing,
    and serifs, and proper x-heights, etc.&#41; goes so clearly against the letterwise
    model. I didn&#39;t arrive at the bouma model only through empirical analysis,
    or thin air, but by reconciling everything I&#39;ve encountered, not least the
    anecdotal evidence. <BR> <BR>In terms of testing, maybe it seems like I&#39;ve
    put you in a position where you can never prove you&#39;re right. But I think
    it&#39;s really not that hard to devise a test that would satisfy &#34;us&#34;
    typographers: bring together highly proficient readers &#40;instead of desperate
    college freshmen&#41;, and give them really good typography &#40;instead of Courier&#41;,
    and then just see what happens. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Claudio: <BR>1&#41; There are so many intertwined variables in typography
    that it&#39;s difficult to test them either individually or as a group! So I think
    a good approach is to simply figure out what the brain likes in the overall and
    design from there. For example, using a single, &#34;reputable&#34; text face
    and seeing how much letterspacing is ideal for readability is a great looking-glass
    into the brain. <BR>2&#41;  You cannot get reliable results by asking for conscious
    opinions. This is a fact&#42;, and I think it&#39;s due to the separation between
    the conscious and subconscious aspects of the brain - and the latter is where
    immersion lies - like Kevin said, it&#39;s a bit like breathing. <BR>3&#41; Don&#39;t
    let the difficiencies of certain languages in certain fields, or the necessarily
    non-typographic, weak-context focus of general dictionaries dictate your thoughts.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; For example, readers consistently choose too-large fonts as being

    to your tactic of trying to isolate me. It&#39;s not about me, it&#39;s about
    intellectual integrity. Kevin shouldn&#39;t worry about boumas because I said
    he should, he should do it because the letterwise model is deficient. It doesn&#39;t
    explain how: <BR>- serifs help, <BR>- tight letterspacing helps, <BR>- an x-height
    can be too small or too large, <BR>- short and frequent words well into the parafovea
    are often skipped, <BR>- there can be a contradiction within Kevin&#39;s own references
    concerning the readability of all-caps versus random-case setting &#40;I elaborated
    on this to him, and I can do it again here if anybody wants&#41;. <BR> <BR>If
    Kevin, you, or anybody else doesn&#39;t believe all the anecdotal evidence &#40;and
    chooses to ignore some aspects of the empirical data to boot&#41; then it&#39;s
    time to stop fudging. Say &#34;serifs don&#39;t help readability&#34; and &#34;letterspacing
    needs to be much looser&#34; and &#34;rhythm between letters is bogus&#34;, as
    the letterwise model <i>requires</i> you to do. Please stop focusing merely on
    countering whatever I happen to be supporting! It&#39;s like when you failed to
    note that Kevin supports loose letterspacing: it seems like you don&#39;t want
    to actually hear clear anti-establishment statements by anybody, you&#39;re just
    happy to see me countered!  :-/ <BR> <BR>And did you also fail to note the palpable
    scepticism towards the letterwise model &#40;and even Kevin&#39;s overall empiricism&#41;
    among some notable names in the audience at Thessaloniki? When the letterspacing
    issue came up, and Kevin asked some cascading questions to some members of the
    audience, like Southall, what was his last question, and what was the reply? Kevin
    asked &#34;if tests show that loose letterspacing helps readability would you
    change your practices?&#34; The reply was No. Why? Because Southall is a narrow-minded
    luddite? Quite the contrary - he&#39;s both an intelligent scientist and a keen
    typographer. He&#39;s sceptical because readability testing to this day has <i>not
    been good enough</i>. It doesn&#39;t matter what you think you&#39;re proving
    - it has to <i>make sense</i>. <BR> <BR>With my exposure to both of empiricism
    and anecdotal evidence, I think I can propose certain types of testing that can
    have some hope of resolving this, of satisfying the <i>practicioners</i>, which
    is the whole point as far as I&#39;m concerned. You need: <BR>- good readers,
    <BR>- good typography, <BR>- a good environment, <BR>- to measure and analyze
    deep saccades and extended reading speed. <BR> <BR>Also, there is no Uber-reader.
    It&#39;s a matter of helping as many people as possible by facilitating longer
    saccades, that&#39;s all. I think you do this by promoting boumas, but it should
    be tested. However, lacking valid empirical testing does not mean Southall and

  body: '&#62;I agree that the hypothesis that letter space should be proportional
    to counter space is an interesting one, and one that I will include in my research.
    I think the best way of doing this is to look at the optimal letterspacing over
    several fonts expecting to find that fonts with larger counters need larger letterspace?  <BR>
    <BR>Kevin, thanks for your interest in the hypothesis. &#40;I have been away from
    the internet for a few days.&#41; If you test it, I&#39;d appreciate a note of
    acknowledgement in your report, unless the idea is already out there in the literature.
    <BR> <BR>As to testing I think that one way that would be more systematic is to
    take the same typeface, and vary first the counters keeping the interletter space
    the same, and then the other way around. Is this possible to do with &#39;multiple
    master&#39; typefaces? My hypothesis is that there is in fact some ideal, though
    a third variable, stroke width, might also be important.  <BR> <BR>You might take
    a face generally held up as very readable, such as adobe Garamond, keep the stroke
    widths the same, and do the variations, and locate the extremes where the reading
    speed or comfort declines.  <BR> <BR>If you want to then test whether this goes
    across faces, you would go to test a sans, such as Gill or Helvetica, and see
    whether the breakdowns are at similar ranges.  <BR> <BR>Another hypothesis I have
    is that in serifed faced words hold together better with greater interletter space
    between stems. In other words, in good serifed faces, we can do the advance planning
    of what words to look at next, using the current parafovea information &#40;as
    you describe in your paper&#41;. The serifs, according to this guess, enable you
    to get wider spaces, nearer to the ideal of absolute and relative to counter spacing,
    than do sans.  <BR> <BR>Whether the guesses are right or wrong it seems to me
    it ought to be possible to vary the absolute  spaces and relative spaces, and
    really learn something about the limits of a good text face.  <BR> <BR>Oh, as
    well as relative counter/interletter space, there is also the issue of thick/thin
    contrast, where again I suspect there are limits on how great the contrast can
    be at small, text sizes, at which reading starts to deterioriate.  <BR> <BR>A
    final guess is that &#40;sorry Hrant&#41; the traditional most used old style
    serif faces - Garamond, Baskerville, Caslon - will be within the ideal range,
    and you can&#39;t really improve on it.  Of course the results will be much more
    interesting if I&#39;m wrong in this.  <BR>'

    able to read in what is, by any standard, a very advanced way. And you have been

    in its elaboration - I believe many people who think about this deeply enough

    of Southall&#41; as being validation of the bouma model. My stance is not a result
    of halucinations, but some pretty straightforward things like empirical testing
    &#40;more the older foundational stuff like retina acuity, not the flawed contemporary
    high-level tests&#41;, logical thought &#40;like why would the brain not use parafoveal

    WPM or greater without loss of comprehension &#40;i.e. not skimming or &#39;speed

  body: '&#62; you were talking about &#39;highly proficient readers&#39; <BR> <BR>Only
    in terms of testing. Because it is they who will most clearly indicate the presence
    of boumas. Boumas don&#39;t kick in beyond a certain magical number &#40;certainly
    not something as high as 700 wpm&#41;, they&#39;re simply relied upon to increasing
    degrees, and at low speeds the ripples on the surface as easily dismissed. But
    as Kevin noted, even slow reading efforts can exhibit skipped words. So &#34;deep
    immersion&#34; is not an accurate, &#34;scientific&#34; term, and there&#39;s
    no qualitative difference between the different degrees of immersion - I guess
    it&#39;s just a matter of how obvious the presence of boumas becomes. So you could
    say that &#34;deep immersion&#34; is where nobody could really deny that boumas
    are present, which is why it&#39;s a good thing to test with. <BR> <BR>So the
    purpose of testing with &#34;highly proficient readers&#34; isn&#39;t to gauge
    of how most people read &#40;which seems to be the main intent of most field research,
    unfortunately&#41;, it&#39;s to figure out what can be done to make more people
    read more immersively. <BR> <BR>&#62; Either every empirical test of reading speed
    and comprehension is deeply flawed <BR> <BR>I think some of them &#40;like Patterson
    &amp; Tinker&#39;s&#41; have been decent. The biggest problem I have is with the
    recent ones that use inferior stimuli &#40;like Arial onscreen&#41; and hopeless
    &#34;shallow-immersive&#34; subjects; just because they use the processing power
    of computers they think they&#39;re hot stuff - but their whole foundation is
    off. There&#39;s a tendency to over-value newer research; I think the most recent
    stuff has been thrown off by the charms of raw processing power. Huey didn&#39;t
    need computers to come up with those amazing insights of his in 1908. <BR> <BR>Designers
    who care &#40;not the ones who don&#39;t [want to] give a hoot about readability
    in the first place&#41; are justifiably turned off by empirical testing of readability.
    Why, because they&#39;re unreasonable? No, I think it&#39;s because the tests
    have been moot &#40;like the Times vs Helvetica stuff&#41;, and most researchers
    don&#39;t pay attention to the complaints of the practitioners. But I have to
    say that I have a good feeling about Kevin - let&#39;s see what happens. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; &#39;Deeper&#39; is a metaphoric adjective. <BR> <BR>Not in this case

    thread, I got a package from Ole containing a copy of his PhD dissertation at
    Reading &#40;almost 300 pages - very oldschool&#41; and photocopies of other articles
    and reviews he&#39;s written. <BR> <BR>Although I have only an imprecise view
    of Ole&#39;s position in matters of readability, and I haven&#39;t read all the
    material yet, skimming through it does reveal some choice snippets: <BR> <BR>&#34;If
    we take the results of legibility research at face value ... then we are bound
    to conclude that a great deal of useful work has been done, and what we need is
    more of the same. If, on the other hand, we take a more critical look at the details
    of experimental design then maybe ... much of the effort put into empirical testing
    has simply been wasted.&#34; <BR>- Macdonald-Ross <BR> <BR>&#34;The two Baskerville
    typefaces are, as is clearly shown in the book, two different typeface designs.
    It is thus difficult to say whether differences in reading speed are caused by
    the different x-heights or by other design differences.&#34; <BR>- Ole Lund <BR>{Times
    versus Helvetica? Puhleez.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;I managed to track down 72 relevant
    experimental typeface legibility studies, and I then performed a detailed and
    critical review of 28 of these 72 studies - all published between 1896 and 1997
    and based on a wide variety of rationales and operational methods. <BR> .... nearly
    all of the 28 reviewed studies lacked internal validity.&#34; <BR>- Ole Lund <BR>
    <BR>&#34; .... dubious and even seriously flawed legibility studies are frequently
    and indiscriminately cited in the fields of typography and information design.&#34;
    <BR>- Ole Lund <BR> <BR>&#34;The irony is: whereas this unpretentious non-scholarly
    magazine&#42; admirably treats Wheildon with tongue in cheek, two books on information

    to suppose that in the sense in which computers are used to process information,
    brains also process information.&#34; <BR>- John Searle <BR> <BR>&#34;.... the
    translation of &#34;findings&#34; from experimental research to the practice of
    typographic design has to be done with great caution. And ... that translation
    is even less assured when experimental validity cannot be taken from granted in
    the first place.&#34; <BR>- Ole Lund <BR> <BR>&#34;Such tests of lettering as
    these are therefore useful in disposing of pseudo-scientific arguments, but in
    cases where the results strongly favour a particular design they must, to be of
    any practical use to designers, be elaborated upon so that we can clearly understand
    why one design functions more effectively than another.&#34; <BR>- Herbert Spencer

    don&#39;t want to know- out of what I consider to be anti-craft ideology. Ignore
    them. But some type people &#40;like Ole, I think&#41; are both interested and
    reasonable, they&#39;re just unhappy at the totally flawed foundation that continues
    to make virtually all empirical research in effect invalid, or at best misleading.
    I think you&#39;re in a unique position, because you have the empirical training
    and power of logic, you&#39;re mixing it up with us, and career-wise you&#39;re
    very well-placed. If you can bear to put up with the occasional confrontational
