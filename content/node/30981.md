  body: "Non-Latin metro fonts, anyone? I'll give it a go with what I can write about
    the Hangul (Korean alphabet) faces in use in the Seoul metro, where I've spent
    an inordinate proportion of my life recently. I won't mention the subordinate
    Latin and Chinese character faces (the Latins are Frutiger-derived, I think, though
    I haven't examined them closely).\r\n\r\nThe metropolitan subway system in Seoul
    and surrounding areas is run by three different organizations: Korail, Seoul Metro,
    and Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation (SMRT). Which explains why I
    can identify at least three different faces in wide use for the signage.\r\n\r\nOne
    is HY Ullungdo (HY \uC6B8\uB989\uB3C4), developed by <a href=\"http://www.hanyang.co.kr/font_pds/php/view.php?idx=41\">Hanyang
    Information & Communications</a>. It feels like Korail has used this font for
    ages, though Hanyang was founded in 1990 so it can't have been in use before that.\r\n\r\n(As
    an aside, trying to find information on hangul typefaces can be really frustrating,
    as often the only information one can find is who is selling them. Most Korean
    foundry websites provide no info on the designers, and some don't even give the
    year of design. One reason might be that hangul fonts are generally made by teams,
    not individual designers, and developed and updated through many years.)\r\n\r\nI
    don't think HY Ullungdo is a custom metro face though; although it was probably
    designed for a signage purpose, I haven't come across any information that suggests
    that Korail commissioned it. Anyway, here's an example courtesy of Flickr:\r\n\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/wrs111445/458693146/\r\n\r\nOn
    their newer lines, though, Korail does use a custom face called 'Korail (\uCF54\uB808\uC77C)'
    developed by <a href=\"http://www.asiafont.com/\">Asiafont</a> (2003?). It's a
    nice, clean update to the Ullungdo genre, in my opinion. I found a Flickr photo
    example here:\r\n\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/zinka/255634677/\r\n\r\nThe other
    widely seen face, and perhaps the one most familiar to Seoul commuters, is the
    one used by SMRT, but I have no idea what it's called, whether it is a custom
    face (I suspect it might be), and the general story behind it. It's a pity, because
    it's a beautiful face that has a warmer, friendlier feel than Ullungdo/Korail.
    It's the face I associate with Seoul subway, having grown up along SMRT-operated
    Line 4.\r\n\r\nI'm quite positive that it's not available as a digital font; if
    it were, I would have been able to find at least some info on it. The Flickr photo
    example I found (one of several I could have used):\r\n\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/kwongcharles/131999361/\r\n\r\nCan
