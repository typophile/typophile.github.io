  body: I know what are you saying... but it sounds then like some East European artist(s)
    who did this monument are political active and they used "K" for sake of showing
    their political attitudes. I mean, how can you tell by lettter "K" if someone
    is communist, liberal, democrat or anarchist? That just doesn't make a sense.
    Only thing that's tricky here is letter "K" which isn't Western's "K" and probably
    one who made this monument or those letters is/are just typographically uneducated
    or they used this "K" because Nikola Tesla was a Serb, from East Europe, from
    Serbia and it reminds them on for example Russian letters.... I wanna say... "K"
    would pretty abstract symbol for showing political attitude.

    this topic, I'm glad that \"K\" went through monument :) Even it's an abstract
    symbol representing his legacy and home land.\r\n\r\nAbout \"K\"... either those
    who made Tesla's monument used \"K\" accidentally, either they used it with purpose.
    A lot of artists like to implement something small and provocative into their
    works (either for clients, either for personal projects), so everything is possible
    in Tesla's keys :)"

    intended as a \"protection\" of the honoured person against the \"misuse\". The
    small community wants to emphasize its cultural \"separateness in memory\". This
    is what I call politics.\r\n\r\nOfftopic, but anyway linked: Ko\u015Bciuszko's
    Monument in Chicago shows Polish hero of American Revolution sitting on the horse
    with his legs outstretched. That's the way of horse riding called the spanish
    school, while our riders sat on a horse on the bent legs. It's not a matter of
    philately difference. It's British and Prussian officers, general's opponents,
    who used to ride horses spanish way! So his rigid pose on the monument isn't anyway
    a portrait of victorious volunteer, but of an imperial general - with all implications.\r\n\r\n"

    (although not so subtle) has remained without incident--something I was not so

    (too) much, of course there are countries where you have to denounce your former
    citizenship if you want to become a citizen of said country (germany comes to
    mind).\r\n\r\ncitizenship and ethnicity or ethnic heritage are two different things,
    just take a look at the u.s., great britain or france, if you wish. you seem to
    think that the two are mutually exclusive, but i don't see why they would be.\r\n\r\nas
    to the question of nationalism ... i don't see the association here at all --
    because he was a serb? an intriguing point however, as it shows the conditioning
    that has taken place over the past two decades, for whatever reasons ... my correction
    was related to his <strong>place of birth</strong>, nothing else. all the following
    interpretations are yours.\r\n\r\njust my 2 yen. and i am now focusing on type

    \"steal\" or \"take over\") Tesla as a Croatian, but it just didn't passed for
    obvious reasons. That's just one sensitive question about his citizenship for
    Serb - is (was) he a Serb or Croatian. Probably, speaking reasonable, there are
    not countries in the world who wouldn't love to say that Tesla was their scientist,
    so that's why I said \"to remove it\" in last post.\r\n\r\n@ don dada: You can't
    understand what I'm trying to say, cause you're not from this part of the world
    and it's not the same for you as Japanese (from your profile) and me as a Serb
    to talk about this topic, since we here think about Tesla as one of the greatest
    Serb, not just scientist, in our wild history, he's one of the brightness person
    and the rest of the world thinks as one of the greatest scientist etc etc etc...\r\n\r\nLet
