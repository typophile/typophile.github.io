body: Modak is a heavy Devanagari typeface. Playful, chubby, soft looking but having
  some sharp corners. This font will be available soon with all require features.
  Pls give feedback. Thanks

    second image say \"Lego\"?  :-)\r\n\r\nBTW is there a Latin? Maybe you can match
    it with Klimax, or Sutturah.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Thanks Hrant. Surely it will be functional. Second image is LOGO (means people
    in Hindi). It has given a Lego treatment. The Latin Modak will be available soon
    along with Devanagari :)

    should be more type like this for non latin-languages!\r\n\r\nCongrats!"

  body: Thanks ferfolio, Devanagari will be surely readable. I received good response
    from local people (regular Devanagari readers).
