body: Am trying to find this font, yet not online tools seem to find it.  Went through
  about 2000 fonts but again to no avail.  The closest i got to is dearjoe but the
  "t" is definately not the same and there are some discrepancies in the others too.  Any
  ideas?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_4345.JPG]
