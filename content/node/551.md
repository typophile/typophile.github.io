body: ' Hello you all, <BR> <BR>This is my second posting here and it has to do with
  the extent to which I see typefaces of the Thesis family &#40;by Luc&#40;as&#41;
  de Groot - lucasfonts.com&#41; used worldwide today. A customized version of &#34;The
  Sans&#34; is the worldwide corporate typeface for Compaq. I have recently seen The
  Mix used on the website some four design companies... I have also seen typefaces
  of the family included in the standards manuals of some big universities and colleges
  in USA. Well, it seems to me Thesis is becoming more and more trendy, following
  Rotis and Meta... <BR> <BR>So, as a result, I was wondering what apropriate similar
  typeface could I suggest to one of my clients, who wants to use a dual typographic
  scheme The Sans/The Mix &#40; by similar, I mean: modern yet not lacking the &#34;established&#34;
  feel, highly legible on several applications, and still retaining a strong personality
  of its own...&#41;. <BR> <BR>The client is a BackStreme, a software company, producing
  proprietary software algorithms for data routing and data compression. <BR> <BR>Thank
  you all, <BR>George '

  body: ' Thank yo all,first. <BR>Indeed some typefaces look nice and appropriate.  Unfortunaytely,
    I only have Base12 so this was the only one I could actually try out on package
    and on the brochure...still I don&#39;t feel it as belonging there.Out of all,
    Fago is the most promising,  I like it, just that I don&#39;t have it.&#40;to
    me it looks a lot like Officina, I guess I could try it instead?&#41;. <BR> <BR>P.S.
    I was perusing my fonts collection and there are two problems raising here: <BR>ATM
    displays an error message  to some of them: &#34;font files are invalid or corrupt&#34;
    is there anything left to do to fix that? <BR>and second: I have 38.000 typefaces
    so far and only a small  percentage of all have eastern european characters. Could
    I myself add these characters to a T1 font and output it is as a TTF for a client,
    as long as the client gets  a licence for the T1 font? - ITC Binary is not available
    with EE encoding... '
