body: "Europe is in a crisis! Countries are in doubt. How much power do we lend to
  the European Union? What is the value of the Euro? Do we have to suffer for other
  countries problems? What if we step out of the EU, and just fend for ourselfs?!\r\n\r\nIt's
  a crisis indeed, in which there are alot of short term visions and 'solutions'.
  \ Surely you can just drop out, but what about the future? Europe must remember
  that we are not the only economy around. You can fend for yourself for a while but
  in the end you must compete with future big economic powers like China, India and
  South America. \r\n\r\nWhat Europe needs to survive on a long term is a solid platform.
  A strong network with clear guidelines that stimulates trading, but with the countries
  remaining their own seperate identity.\r\n\r\nTo symbolize this in a medium I made
  a display typeface named <em>EUnity</em>. It's a very complete typeface, that allow
  all European countries to make proper use of this font. With <em>EUnity</em>, the
  user is able to connect by choice with the use of uppercast writing or undercast.\r\n\r\nI
  would it if you would take a look at this font, get a feel for it, comment me if
  there are crucial things wrong with it, or just let me know what you think. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.filefactory.com/file/re5lkq471wt/n/EUnity_zip\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\n- RJ"
