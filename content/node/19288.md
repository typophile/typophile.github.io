  a startup company that makes handmade jewelry. The client is seeking a rustic, organic,
  friendly feel with a bit of country/western/colorado. My biggest struggle has been
  finding a font suitable for this identity. I'd like something organic, rustic, scripty
  yet professional. Any recommendations? Her identity is to be based on the horseshoe.
  She wants to have three staggered horseshoes like in the bottommost example of the
  attached file. Today, I gave my first attempt at weathering a logo and will certainly
  continue with this to get a better result.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for any input that
  you can give. Thanks!\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PippinDesigns.gif]"

  body: I think the mark would greatly benefit from a wider serif to begin with; make
    it a bit more legible at smaller sizes. Right now it says more cowboy than jewelry.

  body: "A couple of font suggestions <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/latin-wide-ct/\">Latin
    Wide</a> a strong face with hints, to my mind, of westerns. Or <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000054\">Olduvai</a>
    which your flourishes brought to mind. Your horseshoe looks a bit condensed to
    me and weathering it seems like you are trying to get too much into (or out of)
    the logo.\r\nTim\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Thanks for the recommendation pbdurr. I am taking another approach for
      this design and may use Rosewood. I am trying to track down something to compliment
      Rosewood for body text. Rosewood is caps only.. What do you think of using MVB
      Aunt Mildred to compliment Rosewood? I have included the latest version of this
      design. Basically, the client is now looking for a folky, dreamy, friendly and
      westerny look that includes a horse, mountain, river, horseshoe scene. I like
      the progress I have made but want to improve the dimension of the scene that
      I have created (it seems a bit flat). I attached the latest file with my design.
      Any input?\r\n\r\nThanks so much for the assistance.\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pippin_1up.gif]"

  body: "I have a problem with upside down horseshoes. People intentionally put them
    in their homes with the open end pointing up to keep the luck in the horseshoe.
    In your designs the luck is pouring out. \r\n\r\nYour last designs are too dark
    and heavy and please loose the gradient. The gradient will give you nothing but
    problems and looks to modern.\r\n\r\nI would use a western looking typeface only
    in the name and use a clean serif or san serif for the information text like phone
    number and address"

  body: Your second concept looks more like a sportsteam than jewelry. The colors
    make me think of the Philadelphia Eagles.
