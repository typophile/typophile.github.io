Thanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like order for a type mould which are used in hand
casting type, plus its matrices of 14pt, 18pt and 24point in Times
Roman upright in alpha-numeric and their punctuation marks inclusive.
At our workshop I have three platen letterpress, I find a lot of stand
stills with scanty types. I kindly ask you to get us this kind of
mould so that we can revive our letterpress machines.
Kindly send us quotation plus shipping charges to Kampala,Uganda East
Africa. &quot;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>An Epilogue:</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur Mulindwa reached me through the office of the Graphic Arts Collection, the National Museum of American History, the Smithsonian, where I once worked.  He was determined to acquire a type mould that would meet his very specific requirements: ie. he wished to cast type from his Linotype matrices.  Their line caster no longer worked.  I suggested he import a Thompson type caster as this machine would serve his needs very well.  However, Arthur wished to keep his approach very basic, and after exchanging several e-mails I decided to accommodate his wishes.
I made him an 18 point mould that would allow Linotype matrices to fit beneath it without altering the mats, using a special holder to support the matrix, and to provide &lsquo;side walls&rsquo;, since Linotype matrices are made to fit tightly against neighboring letters.  An adjustment allowed Arthur to cast from &lsquo;duplex&rsquo; mats.<br>
While the mould was specially designed to cast from Linotype mats, in every other detail it was an authentic, mid-nineteenth century hand mould.
Arthur Mulindwa expressed his satisfaction with the mould and within a month said they had cast a fount of 18 point type.
I&rsquo;d like to add images but have not been successful in doing so. I made them quite small but this did not seem to help.  My computer skills are quite rudimentary.  Clicking on Insert image (below) I was directed to my files and selected the appropriate image, but received the message &ldquo;Could not copy image. Error&rdquo;  I assume it is a formatting problem, but at the smallest size the image still will not load. Oh well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nice story! Great to satisfy such an esoteric request.</p>
<p>Inserting images:
Assuming the format is correct (basic JPEG or GIF, haven&rsquo;t tried PNG myself) sometimes the filename will throw it off. For example an &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; in the filename won&rsquo;t work. So: keep the filenames short and simple. BTW if you want to avoid a horizontal scrollbar keep the width under 600 pixels.</p>
<p>If you still have trouble please feel free to email them to me* to fix up, then either post for you or send them back to you for posting.</p>

<p>OK.  Image labels had spaces. With these deleted the files loaded. Not sure how they are opened, but see what you can do. 
I believe I loaded the image of the mould closed, complete.
Second shot is mould without woods.  You can see how I created space for the matrix&rsquo;s ears.  Final shot, much reduced, of matrix holder.</p>
