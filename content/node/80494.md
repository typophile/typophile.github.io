    Radiant:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/radiant/\r\n\r\nwhich, in Red Rooster\u2019s
    version, has an alternate K (but only in bold, and not the same of the sample):\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/radiant/\r\n\r\nEdit:
    or, using for example Castle Type\u2019s version, you could substitute a cyrillic
    \u041A for the K:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/radiant-extra-condensed-ct/radiant-extra-condensed-medium/characters.html"
