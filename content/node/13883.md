  body: Tell the type experts about the sample. How old is it, is it a printed piece
    or a xerox. I wonder only because the edges of the type are getting rounded like
    something that has been reproduced over and over again.

  body: Given the time frame of the sample, it could be a Univers look-alike by one
    of Linotype's competitors at the time, such as Compugrahic, AM, Alphatype, etc.
    In some cases, such fonts had arbitrary differences in details, as if to make
    them technically not knock-offs. In other cases, the differences may have been
    thought to be design improvements.
