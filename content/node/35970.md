body: "Greetings typophiles.\r\n\r\nI need to work with some text for an anthology
  which has had certain passages excised by its editor. Its important to denote where
  the removed passages occur. Normally I would use the ellipsis character (\u2026)
  but in this case the ellipsis already occurs frequently in the original text. So
  the problem is how to typographically mark the distinction in the text between the
  \u201Cvoice\u201D of the editor and that of its original author.\r\n\r\nIs there
  a convention for handling this? I'm considering using an ellipsis wrapped in square
  brackets([\u2026]) for the editor's deletions, which seems \u2013 to my eyes at
  least \u2013 to do the job, but it is an intuitive rather than an informed choice.
  I would be grateful for any suggestions or guidance you might have.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks!\r\nJohn F\r\n"

    be a way to distinguish it."

    will easily make the connection and appreciate that a distinction has been made.
    \r\n\r\nEdit:  Also, it'd just be a legitimate excuse to use brackets, which in
    some faces is a real blessing. "

  body: "As far as the ellipsis points themselves go, there are a variety of styles
    -- AP (Associated Press), for example, sets three closed-up periods in a row --
    no spaces in between. I forget MLA style, but as I remember, it has more to do
    with how many periods are used when a comma is also in play, and where the comma
    goes (e.g., play . . . ,) when a final period is in play (aka four-dot ellipses)
    e.g., play. . . .) Much of this depended on the sentence structure before the
    material was elided.\r\n\r\nChicago, at least at one time, recommended a fixed
    space between the periods in the ellipsis, I believe a three-to-em space, which
    is more than a word space in most modern settings. There are pluses and minuses
    to each style. By in large, we prefer a justifying word space between the periods,
    the minus here being that the space will vary a bit between the various ellipsis
    on a page, depending on the space used in individual lines.\r\n\r\nNow you <cite>could</cite>
    use closed-up periods (i.e.,\"AP style\") for material elided by the editor, and
    spaced periods for material the author had elided. But on balance, I prefer what
    you propose - using brackets around whatever you use for standard ellipsis. Any
    method you pick should have a note about the style used to distinguish material
    elided by the author as opposed to the editor.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

    a chacter for the elipse, elipse followed by period, etc.\r\n\r\nBut then there's
    probably no slot in the Unicode/OpenType bible for that."

  body: "The brackets are encouraged by both MLA and MHRA, and verily helpful when
    the source text contains lots of ellipses (somewhat common in literature).  So
    for instance to take out a random chunk of my signature line, \u201CEl futuro
    es una l\xEDnea [\u2026]\_nosotros mismos\u201D.  However, they're also discouraged
    in APA, Chicago, and Bluebook, so, take that as you will.\r\n\r\nAs to jupiterboy's
    comment, there is a Unicode slot for ellipsis, U+2026, but not for the others
    because they carry two separate semantic meanings.  With OpenType you could set
    up a ligature for the sequence U+2026, U+002E (period), that would be a correctly
    spaced four-period sequence.  But I Just went ahead and spaced my elipsis so that
    adding another punctuation mark would be properly spaced.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro

  body: "That's great. That's where editors get hung up, needing to follow Chicago
    and have the equal spaces between the ellipse dots and the punctuation. It's a
    shame because you don't get to use the designed ellipse mark.\r\n\r\nI'll look
    at MLA. I'm missing the distinction between the bracketed elipse and the normal
    use of the ellipse. "

  body: "A normal ellipse would be like trailing off something, or a longer pause.\r\n\r\nFor
    example, \"It's just\u2026 I want to do the right thing\".  It's not too highly
    used in academic writing, but in literary writing, it's a good bit more so, and
    so having something to distinguish between the two is very useful.\r\n\r\n<em>It's
    just\u2026he called out for help: \u201Chelp me\u2026 I'm [\u2026]\_dying.\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nSo
    here you have normal ellipses in and out of the quote, with my shortening the
    quote (which might have been, who knows, \"help me\u2026 I'm hurt and I'm dying.\"\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

    arm.\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply. Looks like you are using the brackets with missing
    quoted material, and the plain ellipsis for the pause. What I'm more familiar
    with is the Chicago style usage where the ellipsis is for either situation, and
    how you snug it up to the letters tells the reader where the missing information
    was. I'll be on the lookout for this now. I glanced through the Chicago ellipsis
    and bracket section and didn't notice any bracketed ellipsis. This is has been
    a hot topic in my home for several years. Sad."
