  the grotesk?

  body: "Christian Schwartz' <a href=\"http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik\">Graphik</a>
    has just been released by Commercial Type, which draws a bit from Neuzeit Grot,
    Paul Renner's Plak and other of the 'lesser' Grotesks (read more about it on his
    <a href=\"http://christianschwartz.com/graphik.shtml\">personal homepage</a>).\r\n\r\nIt
    cleans up with some of the quirks of NG, which is refreshing, but might not always
    be what you're looking for... it's a cool typeface, very versatile, and <a href=\"http://carvalho-bernau.com\">we</a>
    have used it in a number of projects, always to very good effect, but we've also
    used Neuzeit a couple of times, because it is rougher, less polished.\r\n\r\n<i>Full
    disclosure:</i> I am affiliated with CT through collaboration in various ways.
    \r\n\r\nHope this helps\r\nKai Bernau"
