body: "I just came up with a special pangram for election time. I challenge anyone
  who is interested to set the following text in the typeface or faces of their choice
  and post a PNG or GIF on this thread. The idea is to see which font is best suited
  for election time prattle. You can go serious if you like but I am hoping for comic
  relief from the way-too-long barrage of campaign rhetoric that we have been suffering
  through this year.\r\nKeep the width of the file to less than 575 pixels to avoid
  scrolling please. \r\n\r\nHere is the text:\r\n\r\n\"Awakened voters quip, botched
  president big sleazy jerk--fix him!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS: So as not to
  leave you hanging, the judges will all be Florida voters over the age of 80 who
  are named Chad. :-)"

    you with this from my iTunes this morning...\r\n\r\n\"Waiting On The World To
    Change\"\r\nby John Mayer\r\n\r\nMe and all my friends\r\nWe're all misunderstood\r\nThey
    say we stand for nothing and\r\nThere's no way we ever could\r\n\r\nNow we see
    everything that's going wrong\r\nWith the world and those who lead it\r\nWe just
    feel like we don't have the means\r\nTo rise above and beat it\r\n\r\nSo we keep
    waiting\r\nWaiting on the world to change\r\nWe keep on waiting\r\nWaiting on
    the world to change\r\n\r\nIt's hard to beat the system\r\nWhen we're standing
    at a distance\r\nSo we keep waiting\r\nWaiting on the world to change\r\n\r\nNow
    if we had the power\r\nTo bring our neighbors home from war\r\nThey would have
    never missed a Christmas\r\nNo more ribbons on their door\r\nAnd when you trust
    your television\r\nWhat you get is what you got\r\nCause when they own the information,
    oh\r\nThey can bend it all they want\r\n\r\nThat's why we're waiting\r\nWaiting
    on the world to change\r\nWe keep on waiting\r\nWaiting on the world to change\r\n\r\nIt's
    not that we don't care,\r\nWe just know that the fight ain't fair\r\nSo we keep
    on waiting\r\nWaiting on the world to change\r\n\r\nAnd we're still waiting\r\nWaiting
    on the world to change\r\nWe keep on waiting waiting on the world to change\r\nOne
    day our generation\r\nIs gonna rule the population\r\nSo we keep on waiting\r\nWaiting
    on the world to change\r\n\r\nWe keep on waiting\r\nWaiting on the world to change"
