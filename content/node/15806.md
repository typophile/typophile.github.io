  recommendations for fonts with pretty numerals. The rest of the book has kinda a
  old / vintage / grungey / handmade feel, but I don't need these numerals to have
  this feel. I might or might not distress them.\r\n\r\nI kinda like the exploding
  numerals on the <a href=\"http://www.blowers-jewellers.co.uk/watches_franck_muller.htm\"
  target=\"blank\">Franck Muller watches</a> too.\r\n\r\nHope you can help. Thanks!\r\n\r\n "

    are neat -- they have two positions (slightly up, and slightly down) per numeral
    for both the serif and the sans variations, and they're free to boot.

  body: Yeah, I love the Crash Numbering set too! Looooove them to bits. Will be using
    it for a website soon, hopefully. But for a book, I was hoping for something semi-serious.
    I though Caslon would have nice numerals, but the zeros are funnily geometric...
