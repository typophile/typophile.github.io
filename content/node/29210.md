  Screen Matrix was originally designed for the Visualize The Future exhibition at
  the Parco Gallery in Tokyo. A set of posters imitating displays of cash dispenser
  machines prompted the viewer with a set of statements and questions about his/her
  lifestyle. The font was initially designed to imitate an existing LCD display and
  has now been redesigned and extended by Stephan M\xFCller.\r\n\r\n<strong>External
