body: My family and I are planning to visit the Netherlands in June for a couple of
  weeks. We are interested in visiting type-related places, not just in the Netherlands,
  but within easy travel distance from there as well. We&#39;ve already got some ideas,
  but are looking for suggestions.

  body: The Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp should be good to visit, but confirm
    that they are open ahead of time, since I&#39;ve heard that it isn&#39;t always
    possible to gain access. <BR> <BR>The Ensched

    <BR>By coincidence&#42; I was looking at their website this morning. The opening
    times are in the practical section. <BR>&#42;The coincidence was reading the second
    part of an interview with Matthew Carter in Creative Reveiw this month, part of
    which described how he helped his father to catalogue Plantin&#39;s collection.
