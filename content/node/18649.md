  body: I have to agree with Rich, all of them is the best answer. There is a book,
    soon to be released, about Dwiggins' life which will be a must have. The MSS are
    good. WAD to RR is really good, an excellent (and historical) "primer" for type
    designers. I'm a collector though. So maybe my thoughts are warped.
