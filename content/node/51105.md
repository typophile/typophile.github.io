  body: You could also select all of the characters in FontLab and open the Metrics
    window, which you can then highlight and copy the text right out of.

  body: "To get a list of all glyph names in your font, choose Edit / Select All in
    the Font Window and choose Edit / Copy. Then paste the result into a text editor
    such as TextEdit, and you will get a list of all glyph names in your font separated
    by slashes. Alternatively, you can run Eigi's Python script mentioned above in
    this thread. \r\n\r\nTo get a Unicode text string of all encoded characters in
    your font (that you could copy-paste into Word or InDesign and use to produce
    a specimen book), choose Tools / Quick Test As / OpenType PS, and in the subsequent
    dialog box choose All Characters. Then you can copy-paste into your text editor.
    Note that this will only work for encoded glyphs, i.e. glyphs that have at least
    one Unicode codepoint assigned. This means that for this to work, the glyphs that
    represent non-default forms of Unicode characters need PUA (Private Use Area)
    Unicode codepoints. You can automatically assign PUA codepoints to all unencoded
    glyphs by choosing Glyph / Glyph Names / Generate Unicode, and in there choosing
    \"Try to keep existing Unicode indexes\" and \"Assign PUA indexes to unencoded
    glyphs\". \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"
