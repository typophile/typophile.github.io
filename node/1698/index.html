Plus the music industry is going after people stealing their property. During the summer here in NYC, a 12 year old girl had to pay a $2000 fine and promise to stop downloading mp3 files. She was one of the examples of what happens when you steal from powerful corporations. Maybe what the type industry needs to do is create an association with the same legal clout as the music industry.</div>

But I don't think they marketed it as a &quot;preferred customer&quot; plan.</div>

Or are you referring to just the 50,000 images for $50 crowd? It's certainly news to <a href="http://www.veer.com/">us</a> - if it's the <i>whole</i> industry. I'm curious as to whom are you referring to? <BR> <BR>The arrangement that Nick is speaking of was (and still is in some cases) a very common practice of stock purveyors to get as much of their product in front of as many eyeballs as possible. The next step to the thumbnail discs was connecting them to the online version of the catalogue. Search. Try. Click. Buy. <BR> <BR>An equivalent system for type would be quite a technological accomplishment.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Reading this thread has been quite interesting. <BR> <BR> I would like to offer up an experiment conducted in 1994 (on Honesty and try before you play - or maybe it should be called pay) as part of Richard Kegler's thesis project. A font, &quot;Duchamp&quot;, was created to be used within the main context of his Master's thesis, <a href="http://www.p22.com/projects/duchamp.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.p22.com/projects/duchamp.html">http://www.p22.com/projects/duchamp.html</a></a> this font was only a single minor component of this installation.  This font was uploaded to AOL in December of 1993 as a shareware font - caps only, and if you used it in a commercial project or would like the lower case - $10 was charged. (Keep in mind this was the beginning of the internet as we now know it and traffic is not what it is today.) 700+ copies were downloaded by April 1994 and to date 17 &quot;legal&quot; copies have been purchased, from the original downloads, before it was pulled. The all caps version is seen even today on commercial products, in advertisements and in print. <BR> <BR>I am all for trusting your customer, and I continue to feel all intentions are good, but sometimes follow through falls a bit short in the end. <BR> <BR>We offer the type caster on our site for all those &quot;try it before buying&quot;, printable and scaleable, it reduces the &quot;I might buy it, if I could work with it first&quot;. <BR> <BR>Type designers are not like the record industry, large corporations with their fingers in the pockets of many, many artists in their stables to be able to finance the protection of their intellectual property. Type designers are independents and need to be able to create an awareness of how valuable a font can be, weither it be an identity or a campaign, they need to support each other and work together to promote a unified front - such as the record companies have done with the movie and publishing industries.  <BR> <BR>But on the other hand, unless an educated consumer (and we have to do the educating) licenses the fonts on their computer, and stops perpetuating the myth - &quot;if it is on the internet it must be free&quot;, fonts will not have value in the eyes of people who write laws and handle intellectual property enforcement. <BR> <BR>Sorry, for the ramble. Just my two cents worth. and for the record. I have not downloaded a single MP3 or for that matter software I have not bought then and there.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That's some great &quot;field experience&quot;. <BR> <BR>I actually think 17 out of 700 isn't bad - that's about the typical telemarketing hit rate. Out of the hundreds of people who dowloaded it, how many made money from its usage? Let's be very generous and say 10%. So about 1 out of 4 people using the font to make money* paid for it. Maybe it's sad, but that's not bad at all! <BR> <BR>* This is a central distinction because otherwise it's mostly just a curiosity, and very few people would pay money for it - they'd just go get another &quot;cool&quot; font that's free. <BR> <BR>BTW, do you have a way of telling apart the all-caps and the full commercial version? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">-?/lN?u have a way of telling apart the all-caps and the full commercial version?  <BR> <BR>Yes, when we released Duchamp, we modified it slightly and improved upon the spacing. <BR> <BR>The funny thing was when Duchamp was available commercially from August 1994-November of 1995 about 4000 copies were sold vs. the 700+ downloaded and 17 paid for.  <BR> <BR>I think the fact it was available as a commercial product in a commercial venue, it was taken more seriously and purchased instead of traded. This is also before our product was available for download and only available as hard copy. <BR> <BR>Which brings up the question, While downloading makes things easier, does it promote piracy?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Perception is a big motivator in my opinion. <BR> <BR>I wonder what marketing studies have been done on the modern typography market - if any at all? Is there a study on why people buy type, what value they want &hellip;etc.? <BR> <BR>It would be interesting reading. Most companies selling a product focus on the features and benifits of their product - it is cheap, easy to use and so on. But, often times a focus on the product or service misses the mark. Consumers buy for their own reasons. <BR> <BR>Some of this may seem obvious, but many companies have been surprised when an audit is conducted and they learn that their customers have been loyal for reasons never imagined by the company. <BR> <BR>BTW, I am refering to companies in general and not type foundries. <BR> <BR>Anyone have marketing data or reports they can share?</div>
