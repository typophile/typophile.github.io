body: Hello, <BR>I&#39;m in the process of redesigning a logo for a trucking company
  and this is what I have so far. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48715.jpg"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>I was hoping that I could get some feedback here to help me with
  the process. The company that I am doing this for is somewhat divided on the logo
  and many of them feel it is too much of a &#34;SUPER P&#34;. Any thoughts?

  body: Jesse, think about changing the winged P to wings. &#34;Premier, gets your
    goods to the destination fast.&#34; Something like that. Premier = Fast No need
    to  be that literal with a winged P.

  body: I disagree. I think it is more interesting and perhaps stronger because you,
    Jesse, have incorporated the wing with the P.  <BR> <BR>What does their current
    logo look like?

  body: oh. well that makes sense ... but i still think that the P is a good start.
    i do suppose that there is argument for something more like the flying lady. <BR>
    <BR>have you any other sketches? or is this the direction you want to pursue?

  body: Ok. Well then I&#39;d say a complete departure is a good thing. Jesse, did
    you do any other sketches or anything like that? Of the 3 above, which you first
    posted, I think the ... is that Franklin No. 2? ... the middle one is the strongest.
    But I would also consider creating two separate logos. One being the P/Wing only
    and the other being type, somehow with the color and wing? to be used separately.

  body: 'I love the fast service cafeteria logo they are currently using. Do they
    specialize in pizza? <BR> <BR>Of the posted designs, I also prefer #2. <BR> <BR>Have
    you explored any concepts with the winged P starting the word P&#43;remier? I
    think having one &#34;fast&#34; read, rather than two &#40;icon &#43; title&#41;
    might work well here. It might also allow for a streak, or flowing line, or some
    other graphic element to keep the P from looking like a stand alone &#34;super
    P&#34;'

  body: What Scott just articulated is what I meant, or was getting at meaning, when
    I suggested two different &#40;and yet the same&#41; logos. The idea being that
    the P could serve on doors and smaller areas while the main logo, if you like,
    would be the winged P-remier

  body: Oops! It looks like you posted while I was typing. <BR> <BR>I think  you&#39;ve
    taken the right direction. The thing that seems to be missing in all of these
    is a sense of being &#34;Premier&#34;. Your &#34;P&#34; indicates fast movement,
    or transport, but there needs to be some element in their identity/brand that
    indicates that this is a premier company. Maybe it will come in the application
    treatments &#40;metallic inks, elegant sophistication in type treatments, etc.&#41;.
    For starters, IMO, I don&#39;t think the green is contributing to this.

  body: Whoa... this is one fast moving forum! I&#39;ve been trying to make the winged
    p work as the first letter in the work Premier but am struggling with the fact
    that it&#39;s outlined. Do you think an outlined typeface would work well as a
    logo? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48743.jpg"

  body: Forgot to post... the green colour is something that they don&#39;t want to
    change as most of their trucks are green. I plan on using brushed aluminum and
    frosted glass in their signage... so that should help the &#34;Premium&#34; part
    of the name really shine. <BR> <BR>Thanks for all the feedback!

  body: I really like the swashy illustration of a truck logo. At first glance you&#39;d
    think it&#39;s cliche, but I honestly can&#39;t think of any trucking logos I&#39;ve
    seen on the highway go with that type of style. <BR> <BR>I do like your last wordmark.
    I can see that working quite nicely. I don&#39;t think the &#39;P&#39; by itself
    really works, though.

  body: Jesse- <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a big fan of this P that you posted previously. I
    think it&#39;d be interesting if you continued developed a wordmark &#34;PREMIER&#34;
    in all capital letters starting with this P.  Perhaps the &#34;P&#34; could be
    a larger cap than &#34;REMIER&#34;.  When I think of trucking, I think of strength.  The
    graphic edges of this P convey strength to me.  Can you tell us more about the
    types of clients that Premier serves? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49822.jpg"

    &#40;heavy on the right&#41; &#34;P&#34; by having it cut into the small caps
