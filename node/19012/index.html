  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Thomas Phiney or another Adobe person may be the best resource for this question. (hopefully they are available).

Is the designation “Pro” (as part of a font name) an Adobe proprietary name or is it useable by any foundry? Is this term considered to be a de-facto standard for large glyph set Opentype fonts? 

We were discussing this in another thread where I was debating what to name one of my fonts but thought this forum a better place to get an answer.

Any thoughts?

I don't like this, because:

1. In the 21st Century, every OT font should have full CE support. Yet you still need to communicate this users through some sort of extension. I like "Pro" because, if nothing else, at least you know that they remembered to put CE in. Maybe CE isn't such a big deal in North America, but over here, you can't sell fonts without it. It is the bear minium, and even it doesn't cover all your working bases… right now, the EU has 25 member countries, and two writing systems. In a few years, it will certainly have three (Cyrillic), or even four (Arabic?).

2. and because…

>XLC…

And then a CE + Greek font would be XLG? What happens when you put in Greek and Cyrillic? XLCG? Then Hebrew and Arabic? Helvetica World would need an XLCGHA extension. Or maybe XLCGHAV, since Vietnamese accents are in there, too.</div>

I don't know if an Arabic-speaking country will be considered eligible for EU membership anytime before 2020 or 2030, but if one would be, it would probably be one of the North African ones. But by that time Europe will have such a large Arabic-speaking minority that Arabic will have to be added into the pile of quasi-official languages. I bet that there are already more Arabic-speakers living in the EU than say, Czech-speakers.

I don't think that there are any Cyrillic-using countries in the EU yet, but Bulgaria or Serbia will probably join before 2015 or 2020. And there is always Ukraine… some of the western half of Ukraine was part of "Europe"* until 1917/18.

I hadn't thought of that. Another scenario (unlikely but possible) might be a future Turkish regime making Arabic an official script alongside Latin. 

Sorry to have veered off-topic, but I suppose this helps explain Linotype's investment in new Arabic types and the hiring of the super talented Nadine Chahine, and sponsorship of the Dubai conference? The future is Arabic!</div>

Agreed. Unfortunately, this definition may not have been clear enough, as the Pro designation is being used by some foundries to indicate <em>advanced typographic features</em> rather than <em>extended multilingual character sets</em>. Can't think of any off hand. A little help?</div>

I am not saying that my little XL-XLC, etc., was the answer. I was just posing the question in hopes that something better would come out of this discussion than my first utterance. I also feel that CE should become a normal expectation as well as Greek and Cyrillic. The issue is letting the consumer know what they are getting.  Thnere will be quite a number of legacy fonts out there for some time that will not be extended with a full character set right away. I am just looking for a way to distinguish those that do from those that don't.  If we settle on just "Pro", then we need define it in a meaningful way. If we need some other expressions that fill the bill, then let's come up with a system.
I certainly don't want to tie a type naming system to the politics of the EU and who may or may not become part of it at some point. We are a world of numerous languages and several scripts. We all have a need to set type no matter what our political affiliations are to become. I think we can come up with a system that includes all glyph systems and scripts and use it before the political dust settles on the EU.

I'm confused myself over what "Pro" is supposed to represent. Adobe seems to use the term "Pro" to differentiate OpenType fonts from their PS/TT counterparts but it seems that more and more fonts are being released exculsively in OpenType format nowadays, would this render the "Pro" term meaningless?

Note that my earlier defintions are based on postings made by Adobe people to the OpenType list five and a half years ago (September 2000). The meaning of 'Pro' may have changed, but more likely as OT aware apps have been developed the features rather than the char set are of more interest.</div>

If all fonts by a foundry have the CE additions, then it is not really necessary to attach "Pro" to each font name ...

<cite>Typotheque appears to use "Std" and "Pro" terms to differentiate between Extended Latin and Cyrillic, Greek support.</cite>

I wonder if it's really important that "Pro" means the same with all foundries. The chaos is already there. Some even relate it to existence of OT feature, not to language support as was Adobe's way to use it.
Typotheque documents make it very clear what they mean by "Std" and "Pro" -- so I see no problem there. It is more problematic if foundries would add it for mere marketing reasons, without knowing what this "Pro" designates for them. (Related, what do I get when I license an "OpenType" font?)
When licensing fonts, I look very carefully what I will get and never trust mere words.

The icons on the myfont site are setted by hand. They work (for many years) to fix this and to use an automated process to add the right icons. 

So far, the absents of some icons is confusing. Hope they fix it soon or give the foundries/designers the possebility to set it by ourself. :-)

Handsome Pro.
Handsome (2000) is Type 1/TrueType, and has "adobe standard encoding".
Handsome Pro (2005) has lots of contextual alternates, but no CE support.
Hey, it was my first OT face, and hard enough to figure out how to get the feature to work, let alone do a mass of extra language glyphs for the alternates.
Maybe one day Handsome Super Pro.</div>

Adobe does not have a trademark on the "Pro" designation for fonts, and welcomes other foundries using it, if they like. In an ideal world, we think the usage should be consistent, but it's up to each foundry what they do.

Adobe's practice is to use "Pro" to designate (A) Latin fonts which have Adobe CE coverage in addition to the Adobe Western 2 character set, and (B) fonts with the Adobe-Japan1-5 or greater character set as opposed to fonts with the Adobe-Japan1-4 or lesser character set.

For case (A), these fonts may also have Greek and/or Cyrillic coverage, but it is not required.

For OpenType fonts that do not have CE coverage, Adobe calls them "Standard" regardless of the number of features involved. For example, Poetica Standard is is the result of merging 17 Type 1 fonts and has quite a few OpenType features. Similarly, Utopia Standard has an awful lot of typographic extras, but no CE coverage.

John, that is exactly my question. There should be a brief 2 or 3 glyph term which means all latin based languages, and other brief terms for other scripts. I don't pretend to have the answer, that is why I asked.  If the term "Pro" is to fill that need, then it needs to be defined much better.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">The trouble with the Latin script, in particular, is that it is an open set. I'm not sure anyone has a really good idea of what would constitute a full list of languages written in the Latin script, and in Africa and the Americas it tends to be the script of choice for newly written languages. Even though no new decomposable diacritics are being added to Unicode, new Latin letters continue to be added. When Unicode 5.0 is rolled out later this year, it will contain 27 additional Latin letters for writing modern languages, plus others for phonetic transcription.

A fully extended Latin font -- i.e. one intended to support all the languages written in the script -- would also, as a basic requirement, need to support dynamic mark-to-letter and mark-to-mark positioning for a very large number of combining mark characters. Any OpenType font without extensive GPOS feature support would not qualify.


I don't find the term 'Pro' very helpful in the kinds of fonts I produce. The minimum requirements for a Pro font defined by Adobe are fine -- basically a kind of pan-European Latin coverage, minus some minority languages -- but of course the term doesn't tell you what else is in a font beyond the minimum. Frankly, I don't think this kind of information can be conveyed in a font name, because the information is too complex. What this suggests to me is that there needs to be better access to font name table entries, so that one can query a font from within, say, an application menu and find out information about character set coverage.

Ideally, somewhere down the road, the actual cmap table of a font could be crossreferenced to a database of languages at the system or application level, so two-way queries could be made, e.g. 'Show me all the fonts that support language X' or 'Show me what languages X font supports'. A lot of work needs to be done to catalogue this information, though, and it will require a large, collaborative effort. The WRIT project I worked on for MS in 1998 was aimed at this kind of cross-referencing of fonts to languages: we just got our toes wet with approx. 700 reasonably well documented languages.</div>

I am also hoping for a method that would allow a potential buyer the option to see language support for a given font so he can evaluate it for purchase. This would of course have to be web based and take the operating system out of the picture. I am thinking there must be a way to read the encoding of a font and place a code in a given field. This field could be looked up as part of the standard search for a font at a resellers site. The code could be deciphered into a language list displayed on the sellers site. This would take out the hand work of putting often inaccurate language icons on the MyFonts site for example. 
The same sort of thing could be done to generate a list of opentype features.

Both that and the Apple character map are simply dealing with Unicode blocks, which is pretty simple to do, and for some blocks you have a pretty good idea of correlation between the script and language because it is basically one-to-one. But most scripts are used to write more than one language: some are used to write dozens, and the Latin script is used to write hundreds. So being able to map fonts to languages is much more problematic.</div>
