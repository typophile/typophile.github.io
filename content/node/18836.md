body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nSince a few days the dutch telecom-company KPN has a new
  visual identity, designed by Studio Dumbar.\r\n\r\nThe typefaces used in this image
  are partly clear to me.\r\nthe word k p n is written in the typeface Proxyon from
  the dtl.\r\n\r\nMy question is about the rest of the text: \u2018sluit je aan\u2019.\r\n\r\nIm
  lokking for this typeface. Is this custom made?... loosely based on a exsiting model,
  or just bought?...\r\n\r\nanyone a idea?... thanks!\r\n\r\n;-)  Matthijs[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kpn_logo.jpg]"

    Dax</a>  or Dax Wide Bold.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, I know you didn't ask about the 'kpn'
    lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    body: "I am pretty sure that the typeface is not the Dax... look to the details...\r\n\r\nI
      assumed it is the Proxyon from the DTL (after a good inspection)...\r\n\r\nbut
      that was indeed not the question....\r\nI'm looking for the the other typography
      in this trademark...\r\n\r\nthanks anyway, M"

  body: "Yes, I can see there are small differences from Dax. Sorry again for going
    the wrong direction on your post.\r\n\r\nI have looked for the other sans. The
    curved 'i' and 'l' are not a common feature. It seems not to be among the 800+
    sans families I have collected in the Sans Serif Font ID Guide. I also checked
    all the recent FontFont releases I had here in samples -- no luck. I am still
    looking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    It looks like the upperpart has been redrawn to conform more to that of the lc
    n.'

  body: What are those bubbly things? Yuck. Man their in-house is getting out of hand.
    Looks like someone needs to go back and consult Dumbar again.
