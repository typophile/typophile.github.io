<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Does anyone think it makes sense to say that in most, or very many cases you can judge how good a typeface is designed looking specifically at the lowercase “a”? I can't express it more "scientifically" and it surely is an extreme statement, but anyway: do you find some amount of truth in it, or is it in your opinion just pure b.s.?
Related: does lowercase “a” say much more about the overall character of the typeface than the other glyphs?</div>

This is probably the case, but I'm not sure they're related. Save that maybe individuals who produce very even typefaces are coincidentally also handy at drawing lowercase a's. </div>

Although R is very characteristic and useful to ID a typeface, it seems to me somehow that "a" tells me much more about the rest of the typeface. It's like reading age, race, social position and temperament from a human face.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Loremipsum it seems to me that you just want people to bow down at the wisdom of your theory here, but that's not how this forum generally works. You've gotten a bunch of varying opinions and all you've done is reassert what you said in your initial post. Maybe you should listen to some of the other voices.
The lower case "a" is not the first character I look at. I am more likely to choose or reject a font because of its R.</div>

Absolutely no. I only wanted to explain more exactly what I mean because answers like "you really cant judge the quality of that face until unless you see it in a running text" are very predictable and, yes - they are true.
I wanted to check if someone happens to have the same experience, that's all.</div>

That's not what I'm saying. I would prefer to use a typeface that I like less if it fits a purpose better.
My "theory", as you named it, applies to the general beauty, balance and craftsmanship of a typeface. This is to explain, not to ask others to bow down :-) If you think it's nonsense, I'm ok with it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I always start my typefaces by designing the lowercase 'a'. It's one of the most used glyphs in dozens of languages, and I believe it shows perfectly the character of any typeface. This doesn't mean that I disagree with Nick. What he wrote is true and I guess no one will deny it. I'm just saying that the 'a' is very important to any type design, in the sense that will allow the understanding of several other glyphs like 'n', 'm', 'u', 'h' and so on.
I draw the 'a' all the time. My sketch books are full of them.
A few months ago my daughter asked me why was I always drawing the 'a', she said that even with 8 years she already knew how tho write more letters than myself. Who is you teacher, she asked me.

Futura is quite an unusual typeface where characters need some specific optical corrections to work well with the rest of characters and to fit its purpose. As the result, a single letter may not look that beautiful.
But then, I said "in most, or very many cases", not "all cases".</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have rejected typefaces (for book typesetting) because of the lowercase a, f, g, and y, as well as the uppercase G. But these were exceptional cases: normally I judge by overall consistency, eveness of colour, legibility, good kerning, and I don't mind if a particular glyph in isolation isn't maybe what I think is ideal. Since it does appear to so often, the l.c. "a" needs to be at least not badly designed. It's one of the trickier letters (I find) to get "right". I'm sure type designers spend extra time on the trickier glyphs to make sure they are right.
In Canada we have a lowercase "zed" too, but it looks the same as the U.S. "zee."</div>

<div class=commentbody>Lowercase "a" *can be* the mark of a decent font, but it is by no means a measuring stick in any general sense. I emphasize "can be". It isn't always true. Plenty of "good" text fonts consisting of eye-pleasing letters that work well together as a team are equipped with an excellent lowercase "a". Plenty of other "not-so-good" text fonts consisting of letters that grate on the eye and work together poorly are also equipped with a good or excellent lowercase "a".
In a well-designed font the lowercase "a" is often a useful starting point for assessing the overall style and character of the face (as Hector says), but it's only a starting point and never an absolute. "a" alone tells you nothing about integration in a typeface design.
<em>I would say Emigre’s inability to understand the concept of word spacing in their designs, is a bigger problem than designing a quirky “a”.</em>
You're talking word spacing or letter spacing? Please post some examples. Mazda use Emigre's Base series unmodified, with no spacing problems, to promote their cars. I've used Matrix and Filosophia for editorial advertising and never had any problems with word spacing or letter fit.
<em>Futura’s lower case ’a’ is pretty much a deal-breaker for me.</em>

<div class=commentbody>I actually never thought of that, I guess I can not judge a typeface until I played with it a little, but the truth is, everytime my hands are free and I'm drawing a letter in a notebook or on a tablecloth, it is a lowercase a. I guess I give it more importance than to the others. Dunno why. It's the first one? It's the most beautiful? It's the one that bears the most distinctive characteristics of the font?

<div class=commentbody>For a classy text font, assuming all the other characters are in synch, and extender lengths, metrics, spacing and so on are well sorted, <strong>a</strong> does tend "bear the most distinctive characteristics of the font". In that sense <strong>a</strong> does more to set the personality or tone of a font than any other single letter. One exception is all-caps settings where no part of the lower case is seen.

You see, that second character in the second row, for example, is Monotype Bodoni? I like this Bodoni a little less than other Bodonis and yes, I like less its “a” as well.
Of course, I would use this typeface if it was more suitable for the purpose than let's say ITC Bodoni.</div>

Yeah, that’s Bodoni! You passed the <strong>a</strong>-level! ;-)
(Actually, it’s URW Bodoni – its tail doesn’t point upwards)
And – I have to admit – while browsing through fonts, I realized the ‘a’ <em>can be</em> more characteristic than I have supposed before.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I am with Nick Shinn on this. Really all the way. It's about the relationships. I have been astonished more than once at what seemed like a really crappy 'a' in a typeface only to find that in the context of a line of it was working very very well. I can understand how looking at a beautiful 'a' could lead you to start thinking like this but I think it's a mistaken idea even if it is is a compelling/romantic one at first blush.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I must really be a moron because I find myself attracted to the curves in the lowercase "m," "n" and "h". And I also check out the lc "v". Then the lc "a" and "e". And the tail on the lowercase "t".While I find Mr. Shinn's observations a bit purist, certainly in the long run he is correct. However the world is inundated with people who buy CDs for a single song, a house for a single room, etc. What convinces the general public to buy a font, I believe, is the look of the individual letters because most of them aren't even aware of the word "kerning." In more commercial or esoteric situations, however, obviously what Mr. Shinn writes is almost the end all and be all.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>One aspect of a typeface’s quality is the consistency with which its feel is embodied by each glyph.</em>
I call it "integration".
<em>Success in this respect (i.e., homogeneousness) can’t be reflected by a single glyph, only failure can.</em>
Purely for the sake of debate---success at integration cannot be assessed by looking at one letter, even if the face is indeed well integrated. Failure of integration cannot be judged by looking at one letter either. Failure of integration can be established by looking at the whole font.
<em>In more commercial or esoteric situations, however, obviously what Mr. Shinn writes is almost the end all and be all.</em>
If you say so. Nick is very perceptive and lucid in his observations, but so too are many others. I think your impression is based on relative prominence. Nick is prominent but he's not the only person to write about type.

<div class=commentbody>Perhaps, really, the beauty is sometimes in the eye of the beholder:
Just like different people are attracted to different things, visually, for various reasons, it could perhaps be said that each individual is first attracted, or instinctively notices, slightly different aspects of a typeface. This would come down to personality, taste, experience, character -- some love "curves", some love "long legs"!
There might also be a difference between what we gather from looking at a typeface through a 'hunch' (a subconscious response, a first feeling, something that a single letterform might evoke) and a more logical, methodical analysis of it (further study of each individual letter and symbol together).
Typography is life is typography.

<div class=commentbody>I like Dino's point. I'm always drawing the letter a in my notepads and sketchbooks. Perhaps because it's the first letter of the 'bet.
It's also one of the easiest ways to determine the historical origin of a typeface, or the underlying foundational structure of a typeface.
If the lc a isn't working for me, I'm done with it. It's the primary reason why I hate ITC Garamond, amongst many reasons to hate that face. </div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>Does anyone think it makes sense to say that in most, or very many cases you can judge how good a typeface is designed looking specifically at the lowercase “a”?</cite>
I agree in a way, so I would say yes – but only if the typeface is well designed, that it is consistent in its shapes. But I also think the O, o and g holds identity in a typeface. Not to mention the H.</div>
