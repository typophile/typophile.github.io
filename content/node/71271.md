body: "Hi folks.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any advice on hinting \"distressed\" glyphs?
  That is to say: the horizontal and vertical stems are inconsistent in width, and
  not necessarily horizontal or vertical.\r\n\r\nI have seen advice that one should
  hardly ever apply hints to a script font because hints can decrease the quality
  of these fonts and make them look worse - would that also apply to one that is \"distressed\"?\r\n\r\nSome
  inconsistency is actually desirable; I am trying to replicate the \"slightly over-inked,
  decayed Caslon typeface on dampened paper\" look common in revolutionary-era colonial
  America (mid- to late 1700's).\r\n\r\nTo hint, or not to hint- That is the question.\r\n\r\nAn
  example of the font in question follows, screen-captured from FontLab's metrics
  window. Below the posted image is a link to a higher resolution copy so you can
  get a closer look, if desired:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonty_sm_6340.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    pretty well at small sizes, but it would be a crazy amount of work. With PostScript
    outlines... hmmm, not sure it's worth bothering with glyph-level hints, just setting
    global values and blue zones.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    rendering quality would use a distressed font at sizes where the hints matter."

  body: "As noted, manual TrueType hints could aid legibility at smaller sizes, but
    at those sizes, there aren't enough pixels to show the distress. So your font
    would look like a well hinted Garamond font at smaller sizes where the hints do
    the most work. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about that.\r\n\r\nJason

  body: "Thanks, guys. I think I get it; at the smaller sizes where hinting would
    do the most good, the distress wouldn't be visible, so it sort of defeats the
    purpose of using a distressed font at a smaller size where the hinting is required.\r\n\r\nThat
    makes sense. I think I will skip the hinting unless testing shows it to be an
    absolute necessity. I find it doubtful anyone would want to use the font at sizes
    lower than, say, 16 pts anyway.\r\n\r\nMost of the real-world samples I have seen
    from the era (newspapers, books, broadsides, &c.) showing distress of this sort
    have been set at about 16 or larger, anything smaller is usually much crisper
    (i.e. inked less), and therefore cleaner.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n-Duncan\r\n"

  body: "BTW, remember that in FontLab Studio, the default preferences for both PostScript-based
    and TrueType-based fonts are \"Autohint unhinted glyphs\", so even if you don't
    do any hinting, FontLab Studio will autohint them when generating the fonts. You
    may want to disable those options. \r\n\r\nAlso, I recommend having a look at
    my tutorial: \r\nhttp://sites.twardoch.com/typography/font-tech/\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    that already Adam, but thank you very much for pointing it out - had I not seen
    that, it would have confused me to no end.\r\n\r\nThanks for the link, as well.
    Great resource!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n-Duncan\r\n\r\n"
