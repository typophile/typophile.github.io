  font to font. Is there anything to do with the n and m glyphs? <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: The width of the em-dash is usually equal to the measure of the font&#39;s
    em-square. The en-dash should be half the width of the em-dash. <BR>With digital
    fonts, the em-square usually measures 1000 units, so the em-dash should be 1000
    units wide, and the en-dash 500 units. <BR>Of course, this is just a &#39;rule-of-thumb&#39;.

  body: In the OS/2 table, the typoAscender &#43; typeDescender values &#40;taken
    as positive values&#41; should equal the em-square height. The sum of the typoAscender
    &#43; typoDescender &#43; typoLineGap should equal the sum of the WinAscent &#43;
    WinDescent. The latter two values determine the default linespacing and clipping
    zones in applications that use font vertical metrics. <BR> <BR>For cross-platform
    compatible linespacing, the Ascender and Descender values in the hhea table should
    be set equal to the WinAscent and WinDescent values of the OS/2 table, and the
    hhea LineGap value should be set to 0 &#40;zero&#41;. Note that this is contrary
    to the original TrueType specification, which said the hhea metrics should equal
    the OS/2 typo values. The reality is that systems and applications use the WinAscent
    and WinDescent values, for most everything, and the typo values are largely ignored
    &#40;the Microsoft Font Validator actually reports an error if you follow the
    spec instead of matching the hhea values to the WinAscent and WinDescent&#41;.
    Unfortunately, the Adobe FDK code in FontLab follows the spec in this regard,
    so CFF OpenType fonts may not have cross-platform compatible metrics unless one
    edits the hhea table.

  body: Further to what I wrote above, I think I should clarify that I&#39;m talking
    about how to actually get cross-platform compatible linespacing in the majority
    of current apps. The fact remains that the majority of apps that use font metrics
    to calculate default linespacing are doing it incorrectly, since WinAscent and
    WinDescent were not intended to be used for this purpose. But the error is so
    entrenched and widespread, the only way to reasonably achieve cross-platform metrics
    is to deliberatly make what is, in terms of the spec, a buggy font. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: Eduardo&#39;s &#34;rules&#34; are historically solid, but in contemporary
    practice many designers think those are off. I think the em-dash should be shorter
    than that, and the en slightly more than half the em. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: If I remember rightly, Kent Lew said that Matthew Carter has started using
    an em dash of 750, with space before and after as part of the glyph. Kent has
    also done this in his Whitman typeface.  <BR> <BR>This provides a solution between
    the English and American practices. The American practice, which Bringhurst criticises
    as a Victorian innovation that puts holes in the page, is to set phrases off with
    em dashes. The British is to use en dashes with word spaces on either side, which
    Bringhust prefers. I was recommended to use a thin space on either side of the
    en dash by Nathan Matteson - which I think is an improvement. I&#39;ve tried a
    hair space, which I like even better. But the Carter solution may be the best.
    I do agree with Bringhurst that using two em dashes to set off phrases looks bad.
    Bringhurst likes the use of em dashes to introduce lines of dialogue, instead
    of quotes.

  body: Note also Kent&#39;s &#34;innovation&#34; of kerning em-dash pairs negatively
    so they connect, allowing for the easy building of rules - and I&#39;ve started
    doing that myself. BTW, I suspect that em-dashes without sidebearings were intended
    for that very purpose in the metal days - but of course with easy negative kerning
    in digital setting that&#39;s moot - which is why it makes sense to put spaces
    around em-dashed now &#40;just like with the other dashes&#41;. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    in fonts with monowidth figures it might be useful to have the en-dash set at
    the figure width. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: John, where in Fontlab is the the OS/2 table? I see a similar table to what
    you describe under Font Info/metrics and dimensions/true type-specific dimensions.  <BR>
    <BR>If you start with the basic ps numbers, are the automatic calculations that
    Fontlab does for you for True Type messed up?  <BR> <BR>Also I see that some fonts
    have ascender &#43; descender of over a thousand. This is all rather mysterious
    to me as a beginner,and I don&#39;t know what interline spacing I am getting for
    a given ascender and descender.  How do applications figure the interline spacing
    with zero leading?

  body: William, the FontLab &#39;FontInfo/TrueType-specific metrics&#39; panel contains
    the OS/2 and hhea table values. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been discussing this with people
    at MS and Adobe over the past few days, because the difference between the font
    spec, what applications do and what common font development practice has become
    is serious and causes a number of problems. Really, the fault is with the application
    developers, many of whom are incorrectly calculating default interline spacing&#42;
    using the OS/2 WinAscent and WinDescent values. This has prompted many font developers
    to use these values to control line height, when these values were originally
    intended to define the clipping height, i.e. the height and depth beyond which
    &#39;ink&#39; may be clipped when the glyphs are painted. Linespacing should be
    calculated based on the OS/2 &#39;Typo&#39; values. I&#39;m working with some
    people to clarify this issue and to come up with a set of recommendations for
    both font and application developers. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42; Note that this applies
    only to applications that rely on font metrics to set linespacing. Obviously professional
    page layout apps like InDesign use precise point metrics, expressed in absolute
    terms, e.g. 12pt type on 12pt leading for &#39;solid set&#39; text. Applications
    like members of the Office suite, text editors, web browsers, etc. use font metrics,
    which typically include some amount of leading internal to the metrics.

  body: Whoops, sorry, I didn&#39;t see the OS/2 in brackets next to the first set
    of numbers.  <BR> <BR>Ok, I understand that there is a mess with respect to Word
    etc. that you are trying to sort out. But for say InDesign, how does it set the
    interline spacing - how much extra space there is?  <BR> <BR>I thought it was
    based on what you don&#39;t fill up of the 1000 em square, but this can&#39;t
    be right because some fonts based on the 1000 em square have the ascender plus
    descender which are more than 1000 em. So how do the page layout programs, which
    you say don&#39;t use the method of Word etc., calculate the interline spacing,
    when the leading is zero?  <BR> <BR>Maybe this thread should be moved to the &#39;build&#39;
    section.

  body: InDesign doesn&#39;t use the OS/2 or hhea table values to calculate linespacing.
    In InDesign, linespacing is handled the same way as point size, by scaling the
    font em. So for a typical PS font with an em of 1000, that provides the scaling
    factor to produce e.g. 12pts regardless of whether that is 12pts of type size
    or 12pts of linespacing. <BR> <BR>Typically, applications that use the font metrics
    values to calculate default linespacing &#40;correctly or incorrectly&#41; are
    those that either do not offer users a way to adjust linespacing or which do not
    expect users to do this often or competently, e.g. MS Word.
