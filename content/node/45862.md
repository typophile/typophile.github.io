  font? Is it Gill Sans but condensed? The R  slightly curls at the bottom. Is it
  possible to estimate the leading, tracking and kerning of the type 'Downing Street'?
  What do you think?"

    for your posts, so that they are distinguishable in the list of threads. \"Downing
    Street sign\" would have been good for this one).\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    on copyright infringements of their iconic street signs, so be warned if you are
    going to imitate ...

  body: "Matthew, it's for a design project that HAS to portray 'politics', 'British'
    and '10 Downing Street'. I just have to. There isn't any other way. I've tried
    the British flag and colours etc. My tutor said as simple as possible so this
    is the way I am going. What do you think of the ones I have done so far? I have
    posted them on a separate thread. It would be nice to have opinions. Please visit
    the following link to my other thread:\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/45871]]\r\n\r\nPS
    Mike: Thank you. I shall keep that in mind."

    to the style would worry them too much. Quite common on book jackets.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OnlyInLondon_6524.jpg]\r\n(I'm
    not sure this particular example matched the type very accurately but it was the
    first one that came to mind.)"
