  has lettering in the style of  this image:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gypsy1_6626.jpg]\r\n(My
  boss likes it.)\r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend a font that has this look/style/shape?
  \ It doesn't have to have the marquee lights, I can add them later.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help you can provide!"
