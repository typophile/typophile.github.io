  not getting a nice rhythm with it. \r\n\r\nA distinguishing characteristic of the
  face is that the e has a curved starting stroke, so that needs to be kept. Everything
  else is meh... Any pointers?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adhesiontest_6638.jpg]"

  body: Well, d, h, o (which seems to be too light) and n have a completely different
    structure. There is nothing of the flow that inherits a, e and s. Also the i is
    missing this.

  body: Apart from that the beginning stroke and the ending one of e are too close
    together.

  body: Yes, that last one I ws just about to mention - look at the different apertures
    and the shape of the counters of the a, s and e.

  body: The e is light and lacks stress. The left side should be at least as heavy
    as the verticals. The bowl of the d is a little bit too heavy. These round shapes
    should look more similar. Set the word "ode" to get a better look without distractions.

  body: "The e is the problem. The eye is too big (compare with the bowl of the a)
    and I think dips too far down. Also the top looks like it's a bit sheared to the
    right.\r\n\r\nThe s seems to have too much stress (top and bottom are much lighter
    than the hood of a for example).\r\n\r\nOtherwise I really like it :)"

  body: "My 2 cents:\r\na, e and s have a very nice personality.\r\nd, h, i, o, n
    seems too generic to me.\r\nMaybe you can (somehow) translate some of the nice
    personality from the 1rs group into the second.\r\n\r\nHope it helps"

  body: "Did you do the type design course at Reading as they use the word adhesion
    for testing?. I'm guessing you know about the adhesion text site where you could
    generate some copy based on those 8 characters. Until you set some text the real
    problems won't show up. As Pablo said the  a. e, and s, have nice sharp angles
    while the rest need somthing to echo that. Have you tried having a right foot
    serif same as \"a\" on \"d\" \"h\" \"i\" \"o\" and \"n\" KEEP GOING\r\n"
