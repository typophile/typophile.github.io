body: I&#39;m making the move from Fontographer to FontLab, and I have to say that
  their software &#40;FontLab 4.6 and ScanFont 4&#41; is quite excellent. Everything
  was going superbly until it came time to actually generate a usable TrueType font.

  body: Please make screenshots of the Type 1, TrueType and OpenType sections of FontLab/Preferences.
    To make a screenshot of a region of the screen in Mac OS X, press Command-Shift-4,
    then click and drag the cursor to mark the area you want to  <BR>capture. Mac
    OS X will then place a .pdf file  <BR>on your desktop containing the screenshot.  <BR>
    <BR>Make a ZIP or SIT file that contains your .vfb file, your generated TrueType
    files and the PDF screenshots.  <BR> <BR>Please go to <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/html/support.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.fontlab.com/html/support.html</a> , fill in the problem
    report form, and attach the ZIP/SIT file. If it&#39;s larger than 250KB, place
    the ZIP file on your website or a file sharing service such as <a href="http://briefcase.yahoo.com/"
    target="_blank">http://briefcase.yahoo.com/</a> or <a href="http://www.freedrive.com/"
    target="_blank">http://www.freedrive.com/</a> . Include the URL of the file in
    your problem report.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd.
