  Font, but nothing came close. If anyone can help identify it or suggest fonts that
  are similar, that would be great. Thank you.

  body: Thanks for your quick reply. However, the letter O and 3 doesn't seems to
    match. Would it be possible that it's a custom mod to the font?

    Headline</a>. May be a custom mix of the two. Definitely looks Lineto (Cornel
    Windlin) to me."
