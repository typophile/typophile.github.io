body: "It's hard to believe that Monotype, a successful company and a great font house
  with a history of brilliant design behind it, could cut two slightly different versions
  of a distinctive eighteenth-century font, and choose the wrong one to preserve;
  but such happened in the 1920s to 'Fournier' -- attractive enough, if a little plain
  -- and its more beautiful sister 'Barbou'. \r\n\r\nFrom: \u2013 Stanley Morison,
  \u2018A Tally of Types\u2019, pages 79-80. Cambridge UK: Cambridge University Press,
  1973.\r\n\r\n     To these biographical notes a few paragraphs may be added about
  the book-faces originated by Fournier, which were recut by the Monotype Corporation
  and immediately acquired for use at Cambridge. Although it was decided in 1922 to
  proceed with the recutting of one of the roman and italics characteristic of Fournier\u2019s
  early period, work was not begun until the autumn of 1924. When the Corporation
  made its decision, there remained some doubt as to the best model, and two designs
  were cut, which are here compared for the first time. They are numbered 185 and
  178 respectively.\r\n\r\n     Owing to some confusion (due to the typographical
  adviser\u2019s absence abroad), series 185 was approved. This, therefore, is the
  face that, after a highly successful career of over twenty-five years, appears here
  and in the Corporation\u2019s specimen. It is a reproduction of Nos. xlvi (roman)
  and xlvii (italic) named in the Manuel Typographique as \u2018St Augustin Ordinaire\u2019.
  The great seven-volume Shakespeare printed at Cambridge for Francis Meynell between
  1929 and 1933 is, according to the considered judgement of its designer, the \u2018chef
  d\u2019oeuvre of the Nonesuch Press\u2019. As a use of series 185, it is no less
  a monument to Fournier le jeune, although the capitals were specially reduced in
  height. The first size of the Monotype recutting was completed in 1925.\r\n\r\n
  \    The second and, surely, preferable design (shown in this paragraph) is numbered
  series 178, only one size of which, in one set of matrices, was struck. They were
  acquired by Cambridge, where they are known as \u2018Barbou\u2019, and were first
  used for the composition of \u2018The Fleuron\u2019, vol. V, printed at Cambridge
  in 1926. The Barbou type was used for the composition in 1926 on a type-facsimile
  of \u2018Trait\xE9 historique et critique sur l\u2019origine et les progr\xE8s des
  caract\xE8res de font, pour l\u2019impression de la musique\u2019 which Fournier
  wrote and Barbou published in 1765. The facsimile was duly proofed, but pressure
  of work of a different kind having first delayed the writing of the necessary introduction
  and finally postponed it to the Greek Kalends, Lewis after fifteen years dissed
  the type (\u2018It had whiskers on it\u2019), and the project was abandoned. The
  Barbou type has had occasional use since \u2018The Fleuron\u2019 came to its appointed
  end with volume VII (Cambridge, 1930). This paragraph enables comparison to be made
  with the standard Fournier shown in those preceding it. Both designs were cut by
  Fournier le jeune before 1742. They are both un\xADmistakably eighteenth-century
  in cut; neither is conspicuously French, or even markedly continental. Both series
  provide for a persistent need in the trade: a bookish type which is narrow in the
  body without looking starved, an effect better reached by series 178 than by 185.*\r\n\r\n
  \    The headpiece at the beginning of this section is composed from reproductions
  of ornaments designed and engraved by the artist. Fournier\u2019s ornaments as a
  whole and the use he made of them alone place him at the head of his craft during
  a cen\xADtury that included Bodoni and Baskerville among his great contemporaries.\r\n\r\nAttached
  is a scan of page 80 of Morison's book, which gives examples of Fournier at the
  head and tail of the page, and Barbou in the centre. \r\n\r\nI like my digital version
  of Fournier, but I agree with most commentators that at sizes less than 16 point,
  it gives a spindly and anaemic effect. How I long to hear that Barbou has been revived
  as a digital face... \r\n\r\nJohn Tranter, Balmain \r\n\r\n[[morison-barbou]][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tranter-barbou-lores_3665.gif]"

    Barbou in Morison's book.\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote, I would like to remember that
    another, heavier, digital version of Fournier does exist: Corundrum Text, by Joshua
    Darden (http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/corundum_text); although I find
    Monotype Fournier beautiful and useful when appropriately set.\r\n\r\nBarbou,
    on the other hand, has been quoted by Jeremy Tankard as one of the historical
    typefaces he has researched upon while designing his Kingfisher (check the pdf
    here: http://typography.net/fontfamilies/view/12)."

  body: "On second thoughts, I take that back. Corundum is not a heavy font: it just
    looks that way if you go to the website, because almost all the examples given
    as \"Corundum Text\" are in fact Corundum Bold Text -- an extraordinary oversight.
    It's nearly impossible to work out that the Regular weight exists: when you finally
    uncover them, the three weight variations are unlabelled, where they should be
    labelled Regular, Bold and Extra Bold (or if you prefer Regular, Semi-bold and
    Bold.) \r\n\r\nIt  does look like a stylish and very useful digital font -- a
    modernised version of Fournier-Barbou with harmonious italics, good small caps
    and a good range of ligatures-- and I shall explore it further. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, DTW. I've bought a version and I am trying it out on a few pages
    of poetry with footnotes. It's very quirky: the lower-case i and the numeral 7
    in italic is too strange to use for long, and it's not easy to insert their alternates;
    and as a text font it does seem to be cut just a tiny bit too thick, but at least
    that remedies Monotype Fournier's problem of being a little too wide and open
    and faint, especially the lower case g. \r\n\r\nAt least someone has brought out
    a good, usable digital version of Barbou. I can remember when a strip of two fonts
    (on photo film) for the $100,000 Compugraphic 7700 machine cost US$600, a quarter
    of a century ago, and that didn't include kerning, alternates or ligatures (which
    were impossible on that equipment in any case)! That's a couple of thousand bucks
    for two fonts in today's sadly shrunken dollar, more than ten times what my digital
    version of twelve Corundum fonts cost. \r\n\r\nAnd what would we do with all that
    spare time if we found the perfect font? \r\n\r\nbest\r\n\r\nJohn Tranter\r\n\r\n"

  body: John, can I ask you what software you use for setting texts? In Indesign it's
    pretty easy to insert alternates via the glyphs table, and you can even do a search/substitute
    glyphs function for changing every occurrences of a single glyph in a document
    (or in a text block). Anyway, it's interesting to see a poet setting texts. By
    chance, in these days I'm reading a nice sixties edition of Blake's poems - translated
    by Giuseppe Ungaretti - wonderfully set in Monotype Dante (metal), I would like
    to post some pics soon to show it here.

  body: "Hi, Nicola. I use InDesign for typesetting, and unfortunantely Corundum has
    problems with that software. Choosing to replace the italic 1 or 7 with their
    alternates does not call up the real alternates; you have to set the text with
    the weird glyphs Corundum gives you, then, when you're finished (really finished!)
    go through and substitute one glyph for another, a real pain. And if you decide
    to make some revisions (as we all do), you have to do this all over again. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    importing RTF files into InDesign fails to catch the italic version of Corundum,
    and for some inexplicable reason, the font designer refused to call the italic
    version \"italic\", and instead calls it \"BookItalic\". Sometimes it is impossible
    to force InDesign to accept the changes you need to make (change Italic to BookItalic),
    by hand, one at a time. What a shame! \r\n\r\nDante Metal is a wonderful typeface.
    I set my 2009 Doctor of Creative Arts thesis in the digital version of Dante.
    Unfortunately when it was photocopied and printed and bound, the face turned out
    too faint: the photocopier overexposed the pages. Oh well: that's photocopying
    versus metal printing. \r\n\r\nI'll try to give an example of that, and an example
    of Corundum as a font usable for poetry. The footnotes in the Corundum font are
    not meant seriously, by the way. \r\n\r\n\r\nI should mention that the Penguin
    edition of Rimbaud's \"Collected Poems\" (trans. Oliver Bernard) is set in Monotype
    Fournier, and the effect is very good. The metal original helps make the font
    solid enough. \r\n\r\nbest\r\n\r\nJohn Tranter\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tranter-dante-sample_4428.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tranter-sample-noailles-corundum_5810.gif]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In searching for information about Barbou, I see one place where it is dated
    1926, another where it is noted that Monotype made it available in 1959, and another
    that says it was their last hot-metal type, from 1968.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful
    typeface. But are its commercial prospects enough for them to make the effort
    to do it justice?\r\n\r\nAnd I also like Kingfisher. I think it's very important
    that type designers aim at addressing the issue of why many digital typefaces
    seem uninteresting compared to metal ones. But I notice that it seems aimed at
    the area of design space occupied by Caledonia, and a number of other typefaces
    of recent design and high quality are aimed at this area of design space.\r\n\r\nI
    think that there is both too much competition, and a lack of interest there for
    a typeface in that area to really take off: aside from commercial prospects, this
    is unfortunate as I would like the successful attempts to be <em>influential</em>.
    Only a few people, in comparison, seem to be aiming at what I suspect is the brass
    ring with typefaces such as Williams Caslon and Starling.\r\n\r\nPopular taste
    probably would respond well to a fresh new alternative of high quality in the
    Bembo - Garamond - Caslon - Baskerville - Times - Century Expanded neighborhood
    of serif types."

  body: John, you should tell Joshua Darden - Corundum's designer - about your issues
    with the typeface in Indesign; I'm sure there must be an easier (and faster) way
    to insert the alternate glyphs, as well as to convert the italic style from your
    rtf document to Corundum's italic. By the way, your poetry examples look very
    nice; Corundum seems to hace a very nice texture.
