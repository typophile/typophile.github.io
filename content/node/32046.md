body: "Even though this is a typeface I'm working on for a logotype, I decided to
  post it here because my problem is with the type design and not the logo/logotype/trademark
  composition.\r\n\r\nThis is the third font I work on, but I still consider myself
  extremely green in type design. This font is custom made for a client, and I'm having
  some troubles with the overall look of it. I feel that the shapes and letters fit
  together, but I'm having difficulty getting the width (or should I say thickness?)
  of strikes, specially on the letters \" i \", \"w\", \"d\", \"l\" and \"p\", to
  look good. As it is, they stand out too much, look rather bold.\r\n\r\nEven though
  it bothers me, that's one of the characteristics the client asked for, a bold but
  smooth font. Any recommendations on how to fix this, and, what do you think of the
  font so far?"

  body: "I think in this case it would be a matter of judging the thickness by eye,
    so that everything looks equal optically. So narrowing those verticals, untill
    they appear of even thickness.\r\n\r\nAlso it looks like you either forgot to
    overshoot round characters, or that this overshoot is a bit too small. The baseline
    seems to bounce."

  body: "Personally if you want the stem widths the same, set up guides to sort it
    out. \r\n\r\nThe middle vertical stem bothers me, I think it needs a flat edge
    like the rest of the type. Also the bar in the middle of the s needs tidying up,
    keep it straight like the e. Tidy the p up and there's a starting point for you
    to work from."
