  for a few months now, but would just like to say hello! I'm glad I was introduced
  to such a wealth of knowledge. I'm a graphic design student, and definitely have
  a nice big place in my heart for typography. Just can't get enough. You know how
  it goes...\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was wondering if anyone could help me out. I just got
  back from a semester in Spain, and a (design) friend I met over there told me about
  TipoGrafica, the Buenos Aires\u2013based magazine. Can't believe I hadn't heard
  of it sooner! Anyway, so I've been reading it online for quite some time now, but
  can't figure out how to subscribe. Anyone know how to do so? A secret hidden link
  somewhere?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nCassie"

    online, and see if I can't find some printed back-issues or something. I've heard
    it's beautifully done.\r\n\r\nThanks anyway, though."
