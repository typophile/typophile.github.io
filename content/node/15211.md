  the Cassandre font <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1328/peignot-family.html\">'Peignot'
  </a>pronounced? I've always thought is was \"pen-wa,\" but several French-speaking
  students of mine insist it's \"peg-no.\"\r\nMy French ain't so hot. Can anyone help?\r\n\r\nChuck"

  body: "Basically, \"penYOH\" (silent h). Your \"penWAH\" would be a pronunciation
    of Penoit (like Mandelbrot's given name but with a \"P\"). As for \"pegNOH\",
    it's somewhat un-French, but might be written as \"Peguenot\" (in which case the
    [second] \"e\" would be distinctly pronounced though).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "&#8658;  <em>This is a dumb question</em>\r\n\r\nNope, not really, Chuck.\r\nI
    really noticed a couple of years ago how many different ways my typography students
    pronounced Benguiat and even Helvetica.\r\n\r\nBut so many times typefaces are
    often proper names or from different languages that no one could absolutely know
    until they heard the proper pronunciation.\r\n\r\nWhen ITC released Veljovic,
    I completely mispronounced it until I actually sat next to Jovica Veljovi\u0107
    on a bus between venues at an ATypI conference.\r\n\r\nA while ago I did remember
    seeing a pronunciation guide to typeface names, but where I can't recall."

  body: I would love to see that guide. If you come across it again, could you post
    it or email it to me? I know type, but I confess to ignorance when it comes to
    Dutch or French pronunciations.
