    Most often, these two forms are intermingled. \r\nDo you know <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/30378\">Spatium
    issue N\xBA 5; \u2018hamburgefonts\u2019</a>?\r\n\r\n<cite>to market typography</cite>\r\nThat
    is, (new) typeface designs? By foundries/distributors? Historic or contemporary?\r\n\r\nWhat
    have you got already?\r\n\r\nF\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Florian, I have mostly design-based brochures now and was looking for
    something a little different so I thought of type designers. Thanks for the jpgs,
    however I'd consider them less what I'm looking for. I need to show examples of
    non-traditional (not 6-panel, two-fold) brochures and thought 'how would a type
    designer market themselves?' The book I'm working on is more geared for the small
    business owner, and I was hoping some of those who frequent this site might have
    examples they use for marketing their services. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, it's more about
    print brochures than specimens. However I think some of the the things \"Emigre\"
    did early on are interesting. I'm looking for non-traditional thinking. For example,
    one of the designs I've gotten is assembled with a rivet and looks more like how
    a Pantone swatch book is assembled. I'm looking for anything BUT the two-fold,
    six panel brochure that fits into a #10 envelope. And what better way to expose
    a non-designer to typography??!!\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nMarj Crum"
