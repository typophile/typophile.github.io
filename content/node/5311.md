body: I would love some feedback on my logo for my freelance design studio &#40;Makaio
  Design&#41;. I do have a feminine edge to much of my design which is reflected in
  this logo; I am concerned that it might be too feminine? Or does it communicate
  refined, artistic elegance? <BR> <BR>I design a broad range of projects including
  identities/ websites/ print/ invitations &amp; announcements/ as well as freelance
  photography &#40;mostly portraits and still life&#41;. <BR> <BR>I welcome all input!
  Thanks. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/38907.jpg"

  body: What does makaio represent? Is your studio in Hawaii? Or Japan? I don&#39;t
    think the design feels too feminine at all. <BR> <BR>&#34;design&#34; seems to
    be sinking to the right. Either rotate a smidgen counter clockwise or raise the
    whole word a little.

  body: "Ah . . . the story behind the name . . .  <BR> <BR>In the extensive &#34;research&#34;
    of names for my son, I came across the name &#34;Makaio&#34; \x01?\x06x?&#43;\x06x?P?that
    means &#34;gift from God.&#34; I loved the name and the meaning, but my husband
    didn&#39;t like it for our son&#39;s name, so I adopted it  for my company. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks for the feedback about &#34;design&#34; sinking, I will definitely
    make adjustments to fix that."

  body: 'I have made a few modifications: <BR>- I tilted &#34;design&#34; like Scott  suggested
    <BR>- I have also shown two samples here, one with without the shading &#40;the
    top ones&#41; <BR>- I have also debated on whether the white &#34;streak&#34;
    on the top petal is distracting &#40;so the bottom ones have this adjusted&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Does anyone have any input or suggestions? <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'I would recommend two changes: <BR> <BR>1 <BR>You could say that  there are
    three points of interest in the design &#40;a&#41;the typeface/calligraphy contrast
    &#40;b&#41;the picture/words contrast &#40;c&#41;the fact that the &#39;o&#39;
    is handwritten. <BR>Why is the &#39;o&#39; handwritten? If there isn&#39;t a good
    reason for it, it would change it to regular type. In that way the two other points
    of interest seem stronger. <BR> <BR>2 <BR>I would move the illustration just a
    bit away from the lettering, in northwestern direction. As it is now, the southeast
    corner of the square fits just snugly over &#39;ak&#39; and &#39;m&#39; is precisely
    aligned with the vertical division of the square. It seems cramped/crowded when
    you align things like that ... at least in my opinion. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>S'
