  latest cookery show? (The one at an angle in green and yellow). Guess there has
  been some fiddling done to it to set at the angle.\r\n\r\nI am sure I know it (or
  something like it) and will kick myself but if any kindly person will ID for me
  or suggest similar alternatives I'd be ever so grateful! \r\nI'm trying to draw
  at an angle myself and having a bit of a hissy fit with it and would like to deconstruct
  this to get me started.\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch lovely people!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/51zexuGAn8L_5832._SS500_.jpg]"
