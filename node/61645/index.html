  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all,

My name is Charlie, i’m a graphic designer doing a Typography Master at Eina (Escola de Disseny i Art) in Barcelona. 
Now I’m preparing the Master’s thesis and I’m being helped by [[http://www.laurameseguer.com|Laura Meseguer]] who is my tutor.
The work it’s about <strong>"Commissioned Type"</strong>and I’m doing a big research that i hope will be joined in a book. 

So,
I’ve been reading about Commissioned Type and corporate typefaces and I consider Roman du Roi as the first commisioned Type of history (Do you know any other before?). I have a list of interesting cases but I also would love to know which cases you consider as the most famous in the history of this subject.

But the thing i am really concerned about it´s to find why commissioned fonts are usefull (or not). 
Is it only because of the worth of the licenses or legal problems? Or you consider that there is really much better to have a commissioned type (for a corporation or a magazine) for a "better and customized" communication?

I’ve made a really small questionary for send to type designers and I’ll post it here. If someone have a free time for answer, it would be very helpfull for me:

1) When do you think it´s necessary a commissioned type?
2)Do you think it contributes to the identity of a corporate or magazine?
3) Which is your opinion about that designing a commissioned type it´s only a comercial trick to sell sofisticated "design packages" to the clients, and that sometimes it´s better to use a good existing type than creating a new one?
4)Do you think people detects the little changes (if it´s a modification of an existing type) made on customized typography?
5)Talking about communication, which are for you the top five commissioneds types of the all history which really solved a problem?
6)Could you list four advantages and four desadvantages of this.
7)If you had to put in a few words the true reason why it´s better or not to apply and create commissioned type, what would you say?

Well, I´ll continue working on that!
<strong>Hope to hear your opinions, suggestions, thoughts!</strong>

The term 'custom type' is used in english, primarily, to identify type, such as in a wordmark, that does not belong to any established typeface.
Example:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nytlogo379x64_6710.gif]

What you're discussing sounds more like what is called in english <em>commissioned type</em> for exclusive use.</div>

Aside from the specifics of type, any kind of custom element distinguishes a company or publication even if it's on the subtle side. This can include a logo, trademark, a music jingle, lettering, type and so on. 

An example of not so subtle would be the Coca Cola logo. It is so ingrained into culture that just small elements of that design are recognizable to non-designers. An example of subtle is the background music of McDonald's TV ads. Little hints of rhythm and melody allude to it and then you already can hear it about to resolve into their trademark jingle. The subtle look of a typeface that may not jump out at you right off becomes familiar after a while thus reinforcing the brand.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello David,
Yes, you are totally right. I´m talking about comissioned type! My mistake. I´ll correct it.

Stephen,
It´s true that the Coca Cola logo it´s recognized by people who have no relation with design, but it would be useless to make an alphabet  from that lettering. At least as a corporate typeface. What do you think. Hope to know your answers!


I corrected the post from "Custom type" to "Comissioned type". Thank you David!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A commissioned typeface can certainly help support a brand identity, but a big reason that typefaces are commissioned nowadays is to save money. A site license of an off-the-shelf typeface for a large company can be quite expensive, and can have legal ramifications if it is improperly done. Commissioning a typeface can cost less in many cases and take care of the potential legal issues.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Types have been commissioned nearly as long as printing has existed. The first punchcutters were artisans who cut punches for stamping letters and images into coins, jewelry, and other stuff, and printers started commissioning them early on. The earliest example I can think of is Aldus Manutius commissioning Griffo to cut type for him, but it seems likely that printers in Mainz were doing the same thing before it was sacked and everybody left town.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello James,

I had the same thought as you. We could say that the letters commissioned by Manutius to Griffo could be the first example, but i continued thinking and I realised a commission like that was more a request as a craftsman than as a designer of letters. Those designs were already made (or like history says: copied from Petrarca by Manutius) and Griffo cut them.
So, it´s interesting you point but, i think Roman du Roi continues in the first place.
What do you think?

And i would like to add something quick because my quiz had not succeed!
<strong>Could somebody list five of the most important commissioned types in history?</strong>

My list:
<strong>1692 </strong>Romain du Roi for la Imprimerie Royale
<strong>1905 </strong>Behrens Antiqua for AEG
<strong>1914 </strong>Johnstons for London Underground
<strong>1938 </strong>Bell Gothic for AT&T
<strong>1968 </strong>Frutiger for Charles de Gaulle
<strong>1986 </strong>Meta for Deutsche Bundespost
<strong>1996 </strong>Georgia and Verdana for Microsoft

I know there are a much more examples, but i’m just looking for the relevant ones. Could anyone add another?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Charlie,
What do you think about Herbert Mayer's Bauhaus typeface? Maybe it could be included in your thesis. It had done as an experiment to try to construct an universal alphabet but nowadays it is considered the official (and custom) Bauhaus type.
