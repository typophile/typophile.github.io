  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">i am currently designing my CV to send off to employers for a work placement (graphic design) but i want it to be creative and spark some humour into it because thats who i am but im having difficulties with ideas. I was going to do one online but aswell as that, i want to do one taht i can send off to them and add a little extra item thast creative and that they can have in their office. what could that item/object be? i was once sent a cd like cover that popped up and became a little box to put your cds in and was jsut kept intackt with 2 elastic bands inside that allowed it to become an actual cube. i&rsquo;d like something creative and unusual. any ideas welcome.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here in Washington it&rsquo;s customary to have a plain resume and customize the design/text appropriate to the employer. A really wild design that might get you a job at a three-person design firm could end up right in the trash if it goes to the HR department of a big-firm looking for in-house people. Having something simple can also make it easier for you to use it for digital submission.</p>
<p>Consider producing a really good-looking promotional piece that showcases your work and include a well-typeset traditional resume along with it. This way you get to show off your creative ability without having to worry about offending people who don&rsquo;t like creative resumes.</p>

Otherwise it will be another really lame attempt. I got an &lsquo;interview&rsquo; once for a senior position (I was a junior) only because I had used Quadraat on my well-typeset CV. I didn&rsquo;t get the job, but I got to spend 1 1/2 hours with a senior designer, talking about all sorts of things. Now that design firm is a client of mine for type-specific work.

<p>That can be said about any resume, not just “creative” ones. And if I had a creative resume idea as good as that one, I&rsquo;d definitely go for it. Hell, if the parking tickets here weren&rsquo;t the size of baseball cards and run off on thermal printers, I&rsquo;d steal that idea in a heartbeat.</p>
