  looking style. What I mean is maybe some subtleties with ascenders etc that give
  it a softer more welcoming feel. It would be sitting next to a circular logo if
  that helps!\r\n\r\nMany thanks! :)"

  body: "I recently licensed <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=200\">Vista</a>
    by [[Xavier Dupr\xE9]] after seeing it used extensively in a local magazine. It
    isn't your usual square sans in that the alternates and the italics are warm and
    friendly. Used judiciously I think the font maintains its edgy appeal without
    being staid or pretentious."

    some other fonts you've considered and why they do or don't work?
