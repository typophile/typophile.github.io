  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello.

I'm in the middle of designing a book on the roots of creativity and thinking of setting it in Aldus. The character and the feel is good but the whole thing seems a little tight. Of course it's less efficient than setting in Bembo for example but the book isn't really heavy, like a novel, it's more illustrative. I may have to track it out a little to get a better flow. Yes I've looked at Palatino light but I hate it.

Anyone had experience in using vast amounts of Aldus?

Thanks, James.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">mmm... seems sensible to match the Aldus — Palatino proportions for the Nova range doesn't it. But I'm looking to use my Palatino for titling. As well as giving a nod to authenticity it offers a subtle difference against the text without being a world apart or stepping too close, I like the differences between the two.
Granted, Palatino Nova looks nice in print, but I think the way they are brought closer together with Nova wouldn't work for me.
As for lengthening the ascenders myself... it's a time issue, the 'f' would be especially difficult.

Am I arguing myself into a corner here.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I once (1991) used a lot of digital Aldus, and re-kerned it in Quark.
I found that combinations such as s-a and p-o, etc., needed opening up.
That relieved the tightness which you spoke of.
The problem was that the bowls were too narrow and squarish to be fitted so tight.
Palatino was the corporate face I had to work with. Aldus was my cheat for text, I used Palatino for Bold, and display. If I were doing the same job now, and had free rein, I would use a contemporary face. Seria, perhaps, has a similar cut and proportion.

I'll try opening those pairs Nick, good call.

That seems unwise. <cite>Especially</cite> since Aldus is supposed to sit in contrast to Palatino (book face versus more large-text face). But Kobayashi is a very very good type designer, so I should probably defer...

I actually tend to suspect that Palatino Sans is more Kobayashi than Zapf. There's a certain refined bravado, an almost samurai-like disciplined audacity that I personally don't associate with Zapf. But it could be my imagination.

With the exception of Clifford and Acanthus (which are nonetheless pretty funky interpretations), Akira's faces are all highly original "what if.." conceptions, and it's that which I miss during these, his Linotype years.
