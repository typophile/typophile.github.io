  is an image of a shirt that I am trying to re-create with the permission of the
  designer - unfortunately, I cannot get a hold of him to identify this font for me!
  I've been to no fewer than five different sites and answered all sorts of questions,
  but I just can't seem to find it. Can anyone here help me out, please?"

  body: I got him by email before the holidays, got permission, and then emailed him
    a day or two after Christmas asking about the font and haven't heard back yet.
    We're in a bit of a rush to get just an image of the design up, and I would rather
    match the font right from the beginning than post something close now and have
    to modify it later.

    and modify the d and y, is my tip.
