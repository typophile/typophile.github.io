  are two fonts in particular that caught my eye: <BR> <BR>&#60;img src=&#34;http://www.twelve-spoons.net/cody/stuff/decemberiststype.jpg&#34;&#62;

    one exactly like that one. If you mess around with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/thunderbird/ef-extra-condensed/testdrive.html?s=BUS+MALL&amp;p=48"

  body: Are you speaking of &#34;Picaresque&#34;? I haven&#39;t seen it in person
    yet, <BR>but that cover disappoints me. It seems like a mess compared to  <BR>the
    cohesive beauty of the <a href="http://decemberists.com/discography.html" target="_blank">previous
    five</a> which are hand lettered  <BR>and illustrated by the lead singer&#39;s
    girlfriend, <a href="http://carsonellis.com" target="_blank">Carson Ellis</a>  <BR>&#40;who
    coincidentally shares one of your names!&#41;.

  body: Thanks, everyone! <BR> <BR>Stephen, <BR>I agree! the cover is a little disappointing.
    Although, Carson Ellis still did all the set design in the photos on the cover
    and in the liner notes. While I still wish that the whole thing was another Ellis
    painting, its still got that completely unique Decemberists feel.
