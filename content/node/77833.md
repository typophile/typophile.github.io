  passage on the left.  I especially like the ligature in the word \"staff\". Anything
  similar or has the feel would be appreciated. \r\n\r\nI bet I'll have to use 2 fonts,
  cause of the double strokes in the uppercase letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SS_01072011_5434.jpg]"
