  body: We don&#39;t <i>need</i> them, but for some applications they&#39;re very
    nice. All typesetting up until everything became phototype &#40;then digital&#41;
    had optical scaling because it wasn&#39;t any more expensive than not. <BR> <BR>Opticals
    are especially nice if you&#39;re mixing a number of sizes of the same font together,
    which includes such things as superscripts, footnotes, blockquotes rendered in
    a smaller font, etc. If you&#39;re not mixing sizes of the same font, then you
    get most of the benefit of opticals by just a more refined font for the larger
    sizes and a more robust font for the text. An especially nice example of a pair
    of fonts which harmonize in this way would be Palatino and Michelangelo. <BR>
    <BR>If you mix sizes of the same font without doing any optical scaling, then
    quality suffers. In particular, smaller sizes are too light, too contrasty &#40;in
    terms of hairlines being too thing&#41;, too compressed, and too closely spaced.
    Sadly, this is what people have become used to, because it&#39;s really easy to
    do it this way, and rather difficult and expensive to do better.

  body: 1&#41; Because the way human vision interprets what it sees depends on scale.
    Think of those optical illusions where you only see the hidden pattern when you&#39;re
    at a certain distance. <BR>2&#41; Because there&#39;s a qualitative difference
    between reading as a pasttime and reading as a chore. It is in the former that
    formal aesthetics matters most, and in the latter where the intricacies of our
    reading &#34;firmware&#34; matter most. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'OK, so it&#39;s Sheldon &#40;at least the bottom half&#41;, a 7 pt font -
    it can be seen on page 117 of &#34;Letters of Credit&#34;. Looking at the better
    repro in the book, I&#39;d say that: the color is a hair light, the contrast is
    too great, the spacing is OK, but most of all the ascenders are too short: they&#39;re
    more for like 4 point type. I think 7 pt should be more generous with extenders,
    at least ascenders. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
