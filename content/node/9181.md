  not Typophile altogether&#41;. I have a newbie question: If I&#39;m making a font,
  how do I set up some OpenType rules that, say, convert the B and Y glyphs to a third
  that has a ligature if they are next to each other. Can I do this in FontLab &#40;which
  I have&#41;? Please correct my terminology if it is wrong! Thanks! <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Gena,  <BR> <BR>that&#39;s easily done in FontLab 4.6. If you have your &#34;B&#34;
    glyph and your &#34;Y&#34; glyph, add a third one that is named &#34;B_Y&#34;.
    Then, open Window / OpenType Panel and click on the &#34;&#43;&#34; button in
    the panel. In the top text field of the OpenType panel, put the following text:  <BR>
    <BR>feature liga {  <BR>  sub B Y by B_Y;  <BR>} liga;  <BR> <BR>Then click on
    the Compile button on the panel, open Window / Preview Panel, switch to OpenType
    Features on the panel and test your font. If everything is fine, generate your
    font in OpenType-CFF format.  <BR> <BR>I recommend getting the book &#34;Learn
    FontLab Fast&#34; by Leslie Cabarga &#40;<a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com/"
    target="_blank">http://www.logofontandlettering.com/</a> &#41; which includes
    some more tips on creating OpenType fonts. There are also more tips in the FontLab
    manual.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd.'

  body: 'Wow! Thanks so much! One more question: if I want to do the same thing with
    lowercase glyphs, do I just type the same rule but with lowercase? Will that work?
    Thanks! <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>G'

  body: 'yes, you can follow the same format as above for example: <BR> <BR>feature
    liga {  <BR>sub f f i by ffi;  <BR>} liga; <BR> <BR>will give you your standard
    ffi ligature, but you can substitute any letters you want to combine. read the
    section of the FontLab manual on OT programing, I thought it was fairly straightforward
    and easy to understand.'
