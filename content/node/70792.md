  fonts look almost OK but cannot persuade myself 100% if it is really period or modern
  (i.e. the document is a recent reproduction).\r\n\r\nIs there anybody who can tell
  me the difference?\r\n\r\nBest regards"

    very much like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times/?refby=mfde\">Linotype\u2019s
    digital version of Times</a>.\r\nF"

  body: "It certainly is fake, for several reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The fonts are not fitting
    with the period, Times excisted, Helvetica did not. It looks too clean, the outlines
    are too crisp (which would not be possible with technology of those days. Also
    I think the design would be either more elaborate (both fontwise and for the use
    of ornaments) or simpler (Typewriter like) \r\n\r\n2. If it where real the actual
    press would have left marks, as the flat offset printing we are used to did not
    exist.\r\n\r\n3. The paper looks fake. The maker of this obviously googled for
    \"old paper in photoshop\"..."

  body: Also, "ch" and "ck" in German letterpress typography were single "logotypes",
    with very little space between the characters.

  body: I don't believe it's fake. It just seems to be a recent folder/cover whose
    contents refers to 1944. But surely nor the fonts or the paper or even the print
    are from the '40s.

  body: "It <em>is</em> Times, but the Helvetica makes it more than questionable.\r\n\r\nThe
    Times text seems to me extraordinarily exact typeset, kerned and all -- what one
    expects nowadays from a high-rez laserprinter or photosetter. Would a pre-war
    Linotype be as exact?"

    more authentic. It's definitely a different typeface, and, as was mentioned, there
    is some bleed. Plus, there is that underline! It's tough to tell what the story
    with that other version is.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5d93e72a6e7b89750abe658990590a30_3527.jpeg]"

  body: What immediately caught my eye was the spacing of the "1" on "1944" - tabular-looking
    spacing in the one being discussed, which suggests the computer; in Cody's last
    image the "1" is a lot tighter to the "9"...

  body: "Nonetheless, I would imagine that at some point in pre-computer history,
    an enterprising typefounder would have made a narrow \"1\" and added it to the
    font. \r\n\r\nBut where would it have been stored in the type tray?\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    the trick was to design a typeface where the lower case \"l\" could double as
    a proportionally spaced \"1\".\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I wonder,\r\n\r\n- When was
    the first proportional \"1\" cast?\r\n- When was the first proportional set of
    figures cast?\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nFor display settings, such as the authentic manuals
    shown above, the typographer had the option of spacing out the other figures to
    achieve proportional spacing in a figure setting, or shaving the \"1\" for the
    same effect."
