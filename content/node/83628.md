  I chose to post this italic companion in a separate post, because the old one got
  too long to be practical. All critique as always highly appreciated.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/satyr_italick_6662.jpg]"

    which I love; how does this turn out in text? (And inline with the roman?)\r\n\u2022
    Funky X: Yes! I love the T too.\r\n\u2022 Ball terminal on C could be bigger?\r\n\u2022
    A looks narrow, or C wide, not sure which. Maybe it's the C, as the D also looks
    a bit thin next to it.\r\n\u2022 Beautiful R.\r\n\u2022 V looks a little unresolved.\r\n\u2022
    What about something more in the middle of the W...a closed loop or crossing arms?\r\n\u2022
    Y could be a bit wide, perhaps.\r\n\u2022 Top of Z could be more wobbled, or have
    a spur?\r\n\u2022 The lc is unfaultable!"

    arm seems a little weak - is it stretching too far over, or does it need a little
    more black?\r\n\r\nThe /Z/, which seems to switch contrast strategy midgame, is
    no less daring than the /X/. Give us some words with those glyphs to judge.\r\n\r\nQuestion
    mark seems too soft. At-sign may be too generic--could some contrast or quirkiness
    be introduced into its loop?\r\n\r\n/A/ crossbar seems too high to me still.\r\n"

    'D' very slightly widened, 'A' a little wider and more open, crossbar lowered.
    'W' (and 'V') tweaked quite a bit. 'Y' less wide and slanted differently, 'K'
    arm blacker and a little narrower, 'Z' tweaked (I really want to have a non-curled
    top on it), 'S' a little tweaked, 's' a little sharper on top. \r\n\r\n<cite>What's

  body: "<blockquote>Aw, they're [/h/m/n/] the heart and soul of this font. How would
    you have preferred them?</blockquote>\r\n  \r\nI know, I'm really sorry that I
    didn't word this in a more constructive way, but I'm having difficulty pinning
    down what bothers me about them. I just find them ungainly in a way that doesn't
    have the same charm as the other quirks of the face. If it were me, I might try
    considering alternatives to the transitive serif at the end of the letter, just
    widening the whole thing a bit, or making the angle of the right side more upright
    to break up that curved parallel on the sides of the counter. Of course if you
    like it as is don't touch it!\r\n\r\nSeeing the /X/ in context... I think it works
    beautifully! Bravo!\r\n\r\nI'm very impressed with how well the typeface works
    in all-caps.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom left of /Z/ you might try tapering one or the
    other of the strokes a bit.\r\n\r\nI can see how the top of /g/ posed a challenge:
    seems like there are three things you might want happening there:\r\n- a notch
    of white large enough to be read\r\n- a broad strong flat terminal to begin the
    big swooping stem\r\n- the thickening of the bowl at the join which is a key characteristic
    of the face\r\nSeems like you chose #1 and #2 at the expense of #3. It may well
    be that having all three is impossible, but I wonder..."

    on an older model than the upper case. Or something. \r\n\r\nAnd also because
    I couldn't make the upper case reversed 'Z' work. Do you think I should try again?"

  body: "Awesome job! The only thing (apart from everything above :-) I notice is
    that the angle in the lc looks uneven. By giving the glyphs with descenders and
    ascenders a slightly more vertical angle (more towards the angle of f), it will
    probably look more even. It's done in many old italics.\r\n\r\n@ looks out of
    place\r\n\r\nIt would be more historically correct to base the \xDF on a long
    s and z, instead of s. However, z is replaced so often by s in the \xDF that it
    can't really be seen as incorrect. I guess the choice is up to you.\r\n\r\nDiagonal
    in Z looks too dark.\r\n\r\nAlready looking forward to the release!"

  body: "Thank you, Jasper and Craig. \r\n\r\nI'm still not sure if I understand your
    'nmh' critique, Craig, but I've looked long and hard at them, and modified them
    somewhat. I am very satisfied with their overall shapes (and how they carry on
    the cusp from the Roman), but they were perhaps a little overdone. I've also taken
    into account Jasper's critique of the lower case being slightly wobbly (I have
    thought that myself. Some angular ambiguity is intentional, though), and adjusted
    that subtly. Now everything should be a little smoother. The SE terminals of adklmn
    etc. are now less curved and points more in the slant direction. 'e' and 'c' opened
    a little too. And '@' is thoroughly funkified. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, Craig, I must
    ask to you explain your 'g' thoughts again. I just didn't get it. When in designer
    mode, my language perception isn't much to write home about, obviously. \r\n\r\n\r\n
