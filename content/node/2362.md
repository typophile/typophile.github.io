  <BR> <BR>You might need a fast machine. It&#39;s not really trying to be an editor,
  i just wanted to see if it was all possible. <BR> <BR>If you have any ideas of what
  i could do with this, let me know. <BR> <BR>Its good fun to set overlay on, press
  a key, then click degenerate and then the key again, keep on going for a mess. <BR>
  <BR>lemme know what you think. <BR>&#40;oh remember to click the flash movie to
  focus beefore typing&#41;

    by Microsoft&#39;s EULA, which prohibits decompiling. Perhaps use one of the recent
    Bitstream <a href="http://www.bitstream.com/categories/news/press/2003_bitstream/012203_gnome.htm">open

    wonder what &#34;decompiling&#34; really is, though. What Nic is doing here seems
    to be equivalent to nothing more than something like a &#34;convert to outlines&#34;
    in Illustrator - there&#39;s no actual font action [that I can see]. Oh, but I
    guess you mean the initial conversion to XML... I get it. <BR> <BR>The good news
    is that MS isn&#39;t extremely strict about this stuff - you can&#39;t even save
    anything at all out in this instance, right? <BR> <BR>In the future though if
    it this is going to actually generate new fonts, including a public-domain font
    instead is indeed a good idea. Nic, the nice Bitstream people can help you out
    there. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR>&#62; I need an aim for the project. <BR> <BR>I think a full-featured &#34;type
    evaluator&#34; is your best focus - an editor will become too challenging too
    quickly &#40;unless the real aim is to learn the process&#41;. An evaluator might
    include collaboration too - like in annotating glyph features with mini chat sessions
    or something. <BR> <BR>So you&#39;d really need some means of setting text too,
    not just glyph zooms. In terms of resolution issues with this, remember that you
    can print outline fonts from Flash very easily. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    I know from what I&#39;ve learned in the past two days of reading this board,
    I find that a better understanding comes when people highlight their critiques
    in a visual &#40;usually with what looks like the spray paint option in MSPaint
    for some reason&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure if what Hrant meant by &#34;setting
    text&#34; is the idea of locking a character as unchangeable, but if not, that
    might be a nice function. &#40;And if it is, forgive me, I&#39;m a beginner trying
    to get up on the lingo.&#41; <BR> <BR>Oh, and an undo function would be good,
    I know that I screwed some things up mighty-drastic a couple times fooling around,
    and could never get them quite back to the way they were. <BR> <BR>As for the
    new layout, it is much easier to navigate and use. Keep up the wicked work Nic.

  body: By &#34;setting text&#34; I meant being able to see some words set in the
    font, since each letterform in a typeface has to work harmoniously with the others.
    In fact many people would say that such &#34;macro&#34; evaluation comes first
    - the problem here being that the screen doesn&#39;t have nearly enough resolution
    to predict the &#34;texture&#34; that a font will make when set as extended text
    in print. But that doesn&#39;t make it all pointless. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    could only choose a few pixels from each letter - true distributed font collaboration,
