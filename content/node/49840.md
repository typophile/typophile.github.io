  studies. If you could take a few minutes to answer the following questions it would
  make a significant contribution to my research.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Name the 10 most common
  typefaces the average living person has seen through out the course of their life.
  If you can't name 10, just name as many as you can. Place them in order of frequency.\r\n\r\n2.
  Who sells number one on your list? If more than one person, company, foundry &c
  sells it, say so. Three references should do.\r\n\r\n3. About how much does it cost?\r\n\r\n4.
  If you designed a font that was as common as Times New Roman and sold it as part
  of a business, what do you suppose would be your annual revenues from this font?\r\n\r\n5.
  For some industries it is not so hard to find out how large they are (sales; profits).
  Does anyone have any idea how large the typeface industry is on these dimensions?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your participation and I look forward to your responses."

    would narrow the definition of average. Also what people \"see\" doesn't mean
    they are the best selling. Graphic designers buy fonts, so those bundled with
    vinyl sign cutters, those used by books and newspapers, bundled with computers
    are probably not the best sellers.  \r\n\r\n5. Both Monotype Imaging and Bitstream
    are publically traded companies so you can probably get a good picture based on
    their annual reports.\r\n"

  body: "\"And your right. See \u2260 best selling. I\u2019m not interested in sales.
    Just what they SEE the most. Sales has nothing to do with this question.\"\r\n\r\nThis
    is confusing; why is your thread title \"How big is the font industry?\" and why
    are you asking about annual revenues? If sales is of no interest, and visibility
    is the crucial point, then you are talking about exposure, perception, popularity,
    which, in western cultures, does not necessarily reflect anything about the \"font
    industry\". \r\n\r\nI say this because your questions seem unfocused, and my answers
    would have to be lengthy and include many caveats and questions in return. For
    example, what do you mean by \"as common as Times\"? Since Times is about 90 years
    old, and has been made available in every type format since its release, and has
    been included in all major personal computing platforms as a default since the
    early 80's, it's impossible to consider designing a typeface as widely used, or
    as easily available, or as thoroughly exposed as Times. This completely ignores
    the issue of what Times has historically proven to be worth in financial terms,
    or what you might pay as the total cost of a new design. \r\n\r\nThis is the tip
    of quite an iceberg. "

    The very most ubiquitous fonts are bundled. I don't think \"Arial\" is a best-seller.
    Additionally, all the typefaces in question are at least 25 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.
    For some industries it is not so hard to find out how large they are (sales; profits).
    Does anyone have any idea how large the typeface industry is on these dimensions?\r\n\r\nDo
    you only include sales in English-speaking countries? Do you include commissioned
    work, or only retail sales?\r\n\r\n"
