body: "Hi,\r\nThere seems to be a problem with IE in implementing 'mirroring' effect
  to characters such as parenthesis in rtl context. My font has this problem in rtl
  along many others. However, it seems to be a solution because MS fonts containing
  rtl scripts (like Times New Roman) don't have this problem with IE.\r\nMy font works
  well with FireFox or Opera. It's definitively an IE shortcoming but I wonder how
  MS fonts managed to circumvent this and how I can implement it in my font with FontLab
  (or Apple tools)"
