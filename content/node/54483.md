  at the Dallas Morning News]]\r\n<em>Lucille Hester, the 69-year-old former school
  teacher who provided the \"goosebump moment\" of Bob Hayes' Pro Football Hall of
  Fame election last weekend, tried Wednesday to answer thorny questions about type
  fonts.\r\n\r\nHayes' family members have questioned the validity of the letter she
  read to a national TV audience, noting in particular a \"Bob Hayes\" signature they
  say is obviously forged.\r\n\r\nBut on Wednesday, the focus turned to the letter's
  typeface. At The Dallas Morning News' request, one of the world's most noted typeface
  designers examined a photo of the purported Hayes letter, which was dated Oct. 29,
  1999.\r\n\r\nDutch designer Luc(as) de Groot said the letter's typeface is \"definitely
  Calibri,\" which he designed for Microsoft in 2003. It was not available to the
  public until the debut of Microsoft Office 2007.</em> \r\n\r\nRest of the story

    not Calibri, it's actually Sans-serif (probably MS Sans-serif) which has been
    around forever. The spacing of the letters is the difference.\"</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>\"You

    rich, because one of the tests Thomas ran was to retype the letter in Word 2007
    with Calibri. Not only did it match perfectly, but it was evident that the letter
    was created using Word's default settings.\r\n\r\nC'mon forgers, throw us a difficult
    one."

    to have known that it was Calibri to know they should contact Luc(as) in the first
    place. I detect a typophile working at the Dallas News! Or did they contact Thomas
    first?\r\n\r\nI hope Thomas chimes in on this one. BTW, great graphic, eliason!"

    place in England in the 1920s, and somebody's reading a <em>Times</em> set in
    Times New Roman, introduced in 1931? Okay, maybe it's just me.
