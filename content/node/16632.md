  body: "Vidya, \r\nyour Arial Unicode MS.ttf is probably a TrueType-flavoured OpenType.
    (There are two kinds of OpenType: TrueType- and CFF-flavoured. The TrueType flavour
    uses the TrueType method of glyph description, and the CFF flavour uses the PostScript
    Type 1 Compact Font Format method of glyph description. (These differences have
    to do with the way the actual letterforms are \"drawn\": the winding direction
    of the outlines and the way that bezier points and control handles describe the
    arcs of the letters.))\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, an AFM file is really only meant
    for \"standard\" 256-character fonts where Unicode indexing is not necessarily
    built in. One can create OpenType files with \"individual kern pairs\" table -
    where each kerned pair is an unique line of code - which is the same form as an
    AFM, instead of using a kern feature, but this is technically undesirable.\r\n\r\nSo,
    I think that if you have a font with more than 256 characters, the only way for
    all of those characters to be accessed is with \"advanced\" font formats, such
    as the OpenType formats. If you generate a 256+ character font as a regular/heriloom
    PS Type 1 font, only the basic gamut of the first 256 characters will be available,
    so any super-gamut kerning will be unused, although it can still be in the AFM
    (and suitcase) file.\r\n\r\nThomas, Si, am I right about this? Vidya, does this
    answer your question?"

    body: "AFM stands for \"Adobe Font Metrics,\" and is associated with Type 1 fonts.
      You can certainly have Type 1 fonts with more than 256 characters (most of mine
      do), but you can only encode 256 at one time. Since QuarkMaker doesn't (to my
      knowledge) allow one to write their own encoding vectors, most people \"chunk\"
      them into 256 characters, and frequently tell big fibs about the character names,
      such as using \"a\" for a small capital in a different \"small caps\" font.
      But if you can write your own encoding vector, you can put all the glyphs in
      one Type 1 font, properly named, and write off several encodings to use as you
      need. The plus for doing this is that if you decide to change the kerning say,
      between A and W, you do it only in one place, instead needing to do it in both
      the \"regular\" font and the \"small caps\" font. The AFM associated with one
      of our \"big\" fonts has all the characters and kerning, i.e., more than 256
      characters.\r\n\r\nBut there isn't a lot of point to this approach these days,
      unless you are using a typesetting program that will let you write your own
      encoding vectors, and even there, assembling and using something for CJK is
      tough."

  body: "Perhaps you need to tell us why you are asking -- What are you trying to
    do, to achieve? I suspect the answer which is true for you is \"No.\"\r\n\r\nOnce
    again, I think what you are asking about is Type 1 fonts. The AFM file is metrical
    data, not a font. I don't know what you mean by the term \"multibyte\" -- 16-bit
    bytes? (i.e., 16-bit character encoding) Why do you want Type 1 fonts -- i.e.,
    will Type 1 fonts in an OpenType wrapper (as Chester mentions) work for you?"

  body: 'An AFM file contains three parts: a header, glyph metrics data, and kerning
    data. The glyph metrics data is organised in a Type 1 centric way in that it uses
    an 8-bit encoding vector. Glyphs in the font that are outside the 8-bit vector
    are still listed in the AFM however: their metrics are present, and they are included
    in the kern pair data. But they are only listed by glyph name: the AFM does not
    contain multibyte encoding data.'
