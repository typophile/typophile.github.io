  were photocopied from two books about artists, (Paula Rego and C. Brancusi)\r\nI
  was told that the (John McEwen face) is Simoncini Garamond.\r\nAnd just recently,
  that the Brancusi type is ITC Garamond letterspaced a bit.\r\n\r\nOther than Akzidenz
  in the bottom example on the right,\r\nwhat could the sans be that reads \"Paula
  Rego\"?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nTake it easy and take care,\r\n\r\nJ P H"
