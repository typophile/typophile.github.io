  body: ' Thanks a million for your answer, Kent. This font comes from a Silicone

    the word Christian, historically I mean. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a creative graphic designer,
    and i&#39;m searching for a friend of mine, wich is also freelance in the field.
    He&#39;s trying to find this font for redability on Mac platform. <BR> <BR>Philippe. '

    to the firsts times of the Christian era : the firsts christians use that word
    to describe the peasants who still idolizing olds gods. &#39;Historically&#39;
    may be used here in a subtle degree : the world have billions and billions of
