  body: Yeah I guess so. You are right on all counts. BTW The digitisation of Neon2
    is kinda crummy, so I don't think it's an authorised digitisation. ;^)

  body: "FYI--\r\n[[Dean Morris]], the designer of the one and only true original
    Quicksilver, just posted the <a href=\"http://www.desktoppublishingforum.com/bb/showthread.php?p=45759#poststop\"
    target-\"new\"><strong>full story</strong></a> (at another forum where I ocassionally
    ID faces) behind his designing the typeface, Letraset and the laments of poor
    rip-offs.\r\nMaybe we can entice him here!\r\n\r\nWith his permission, I am able
    to \"<em>pass along this modest piece of graphic microhistory.</em>\"\r\n\r\n<strong>***THE
    STORY OF LETRASET'S QUICKSILVER TYPEFACE***</strong> \r\n\r\nI'm Dean Morris,
    the designer of the typeface \"Quicksilver\" that came out in 1976 as part of
    Letraset's Letragraphica range of rub-down fonts, the stylishly aggeressive ones
    in the yellow pages of the catalog. \r\n\r\nI named the typeface \"Quicksliver\"
    because it looked like bent thermometers \u2014 quicksilver being a nickname for
    mercury (I never meant it to suggest neon), and because \"Quicksilver\" had some
    of the cooler letters such as Q, K, E, and R. The name was my second choice, however.
    Letraset Englishly felt that my first choice, \r\n\"Polished Sausage\", would
    be \"rather unpopular in foreign markets\". \r\n\r\nI designed it as a 16 year-old
    kid in John Glenn High School in Bay City, Michigan, and sent Letraset a xerox
    of a tight sketch of 3\" letters kerned with the heavy outlines slightly overlapping
    as I originally intended. I drew only the skinny S without an alternate and submitted
    no punctuation (what did I know?). \r\n\r\nLetraset must have wanted it real fast
    (disco was WHITE HOT then, remember), because they did the finished art themselves
    at 5\" high (they can't have known my age, maybe they had no confidence in my
    technical talent), starting with the E as did I in the design stage. And what
    a gorgeous rendering job they did in the pre-Mac days of ruling pens, straightedges,
    and handdrawn curves (those aren't compass curves)! \r\n\r\nLetraset stayed very
    close to my tight sketch, designed the punctuation, and suggested an alternate
    but weird wide S, which I approved, figuring there was probably no other decent
    way to design it. I imagined the punctuation would match the stroke width of the
    letters but they drew them narrower and slightly oddly, but I figured what the
    hell. \r\n\r\nIf you wondered, \"What was I thinking?\" when you looked at the
    A, B, E, F, K, N, Q, R, and Y, I'll tell you. I was simply trying to describe
    part of the letter being drawn in the wrong direction. I thought I was so clever.
    For instance the E cross-stroke goes from right to left rather than from left
    to right like, oh, any other Roman cap E in history. R and Q diagonals came from
    waaaaaaaay on the other side, N goes waaaaaaay around the wrong way before starting
    the diagonal. \"Chrome\" letters can branch but these \"glass tube\" letters don't!
    \r\n\r\nAlas, digitization came along eventually and Fontographer technology followed.
    Crash went sales of rub-down type, and control of artwork was pirated without
    my knowledge and beyond my control, which I don't condone but I totally understand.\r\n\r\nThe
    first album cover I saw with Quicksilver was Men At Work's first smash LP, then
    punk pioneer Stiff Records' logo appeared on 45 rpm labels with a clearly Quicksliver-inspired
    F. For about ten years I, family, and friends collected food packages, posters,
    took photos of signs, etc. with Quicksliver from around the world. I think it's
    about the easiest typeface to mishandle ever. Eventually I stopped trying to keep
    track of it. \r\n\r\nMaybe I'm overestimating its popularity now after 30 years
    (I totally forgot about it for about a decade), but to me seeing it around at
    all is itself a rave. I can't remember why I Googled \"Quicksilver Letraset\"
    a few days ago and what I found was a whole community of sites for font identification
    and original name lists (where they bothered to accurately credit me as designer
    which gets me RIGHT HERE). It makes me feel less forgotten even though I don't
    see royalties. \r\n\r\nBTW, I never did, nor did Letraset ask me to, design a
    lower case version. Feel free to pass along this modest piece of graphic microhistory
    to any Letraheads.\r\n\r\nDean Morris, May 2007, New York City."
