		<div class="commentbody">Cross-referencing 1 and 4 implies that the translation of "макет" is "layout" because it applies to all stages, from empty to complete. The other words in 1 refer specifically to the sketched approximation of what a design may look like, which is most frequently called by the short form "comp". Your indd layout is a comp/mock-up if it's got dummy-text in it (Curious: is there a Russian counterpart to Lorem Ipsum?)

2 is unclear to me, but when a layout is sent to the client for them to examine and identify anything that must be changed before it can be used as the final original, that is a "proof". Also, after the designer's work is done, the printing office will often send a printer's proof, to verify that they have printed it correctly before starting the whole print run.

3 is probably typesetting.

4. The directly transliterated "original" is appropriate. It is called this because the copies will be made from it. It was "paste-up" in the days of drafting tables and line tape. Nowadays the meaning is clearest if you just call it the "final PDF".</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There aren't single words for most of those things. Most of the words you found are used, but have slightly different meanings depending on the context in which they're used and the preference of the person or business using them. In English these kinds of industry-specific terms that vary from place to place are generally referred to as <em>jargon</em>.

In general, I would call a hand-written sketch a <em>sketch</em>, a <em>rough</em> or a <em>rough sketch</em>.

I've never heard a term for a partially finished InDesign file, and I would just call it, unimaginatively enough, a partially finished InDesign file. If it is a file with the basic page layout that serves as a starting point to build the pages of a magazine, newspaper or other publication, it would typically be called a <em>template</em>. A template might contain all the standard basics associated with that publication, like page numbers, sample headlines, sample table of contents, etc., that would then be modified by the layout artist/designer as needed.

At the newspaper where I worked as the design director, the processing of composing the finished text on pages was called <em>pagination</em>. This is not a universal term, however, and the process is referred to in different ways at different publications. I can think of no widely used term that means exactly that. Instead, the processes is a series of steps — each of which might have different terms in different places and contexts.

A finished, high-resolution PDF that's been prepared for commercial printing is usually referred to as a <em>press-ready PDF</em>.

As I mentioned these terms are quite fluid in the sense that other terms are often used by other people in different situations.

Of the online definitions you found, some of them mean very precise things  in specific situations. Several of the terms are outdated in the sense that they refer to processes and techniques that are no longer used. If you're interested, I'd be happy to give you an explanation for any of those terms and whether or not they're appropriate for what you have in mind.</div>

I'd just add that since most layouts go through several revisions you should use a version number. For example "Layout-1" (which you'd call Layout Version 1), then "Layout-2" and so forth. When it's been approved by the client — let's say version 3 — it becomes "Layout-3-Final" and "Layout-3-Final.pdf". Each designer has his own methods but I've generally seen it done this way.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@cerulean, @Thylacine, @JamesM -- thank you all very much for your answers!

@Gusta, wow! I haven't knew about this too. I don't have InDesign right now, but I wonder, what about the hyphenization for this text? Sure, it's invented by InDesign team, and it hasn't long history like Lorem Ipsum text.

@cerulean, @Thylacine, some words about <em>2</em> (partially finished layout). I meant there is the division of labour, and the work of the designer (art director) who did the template is called one way, and the work of the designer (typesetter?) who setting the pages (?) by this template called another way. But it would be one indesign file: Layout-1, Layout-2, Layout-3...

So, If I hear you alright, I can say:
<ol>
<li>at first I make the <em>comp</em>, or the <em>template of layout</em>;</li>
<li>then I make the <em>layout</em></li>
<li>by <em>typesetting</em> and <em>paginating</em> the text;</li>
<li>and finally it becomes the <em>print-ready PDF</em>, or just <em>original</em>.</li>
</ul>
Is it right?

@Thylacine, I would like to know about the verbs <em>to compose</em> and <em>to impose</em>. When do you use these words?

Also, I found the German translation of the verb "верстать" ("umbrechen"), and I compared it with the English translation:

<img src="http://nikve.ru/kartinki/umbrechen.png">

Is it the same as <em>to compose</em> and <em>to impose</em>?</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Some of these processes and work flows are new enough and vary enough from one place or business to another than no widely accepted words exist to describe them. There are also lots of terms that are left over from pre-digital publishing days that have been borrowed, but are no longer entirely accurate.

A typical situation might be something like the following:

A designer or art director does a series of <em>roughs</em>, which enables him to quickly explore a number of ideas. The designer might then develop <em>mockups</em> or <em>comps</em> of these ideas to show clients or employers. If the client or employer suggests changes, a set of <em>revisions</em> are made. If the client accepts the revisions, the project moves into actual <em>layout and production</em>, which varies greatly depending on the project and the established workflows at the agency or publishing house.

At a magazine, for example, an art director might oversee the design and production of the publication. This would involve a coordinated effort between the editors and the art director. The art director might develop a basic <em>layout</em> of the magazine based on the general style of the magazine and using the pre-prepared <em>templates</em>. Stories and advertisements would be flowed into position to see how everything fits.

At this point, the magazine moves into <em>production</em> where a <em>production or layout artist</em> puts it all together into what would, in pre-digital times, have been called a <em>mechanical</em> that consisted of <em>paste-up</em> on <em>mechanical boards</em> and cut film <em>overlays</em>. However, this has all been replaced by digital or <em>desktop publishing</em> where the entire process is done on computers.

Depending on the situation a senior designer might design and <em>lay out</em> the more important pages while a <em>production artist</em> is tasked with making everything fit. The art director or a <em>senior designer</em> might personally design some of the more important <em>feature layouts</em> and the cover. Again, these more important pages might originate as rough sketches and proceed through the comp approval process before production begins.

Once the layout and production of the magazine is completed, it goes through a series of <em>proofs</em>, where it's meticulously reviewed by the editors, publisher and art director. When finished, a <em>press-ready PDF</em> might be made to send to the printer. The <em>prepress</em> department at the printer oversees whatever needs to be done to get the files to <em>RIP</em> (processed through the image or plate setting machine) where negatives or printing plates are produced. These prepress tasks might include fixing problems with the files, determining <em>imposition</em>, etc. Using this same RIP, the publisher will produce a <em>final proof</em>, which the client must sign before the job <em>goes to press</em>.

Anyway, there are endless variations of this typical workflow that I've described. I've used a lot of the jargon that might commonly be used to describe these processes, so I hope that helps. A lot of the times, though, there isn't an exact or universally understood word, so the relevant step in the process is simply described in a sentence or two instead of being named.</div>

>  a press-ready PDF might be made to send to the printer

Or you might send the printer the original InDesign file and graphics. This is my preference as it gives the pre-press department more options when preparing the file, especially if a last-minute change is needed. But if sending the InDesign file I always include a PDF too, for reference.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">nikve wrote: <em>"I would like to know about the verbs to compose and to impose."</em>

I can see why you're confused by these two words. They have very different meanings and refer to completely different things.

First, compose has many different meanings both in print production and in everyday life. In general, it means assembling something into an ideal configuration.

In print production, however, its something of an antiquated term describing a task that, for the most part, no longer exists. Composing referred to the task of assembling the metal type into words, sentences and entire pages.

Depending on the technology involved, the compositor (the person assigned to with the task of composing) would have been the person working directly with individual metal letters or the person running the machines that composed the metal strips of type for the printing press. Of course this process has been replaced by more modern methods in commercial printing, so the term "compose" no longer has the specific meaning in printing that it once did. Today, it's word that might be best avoided in print production since its meaning is either obsolete or potentially confusing or confused with other processes.

Second, impose has a very different meaning. In printing imposing or imposition refers to the process by which pages are arranged on a sheet of paper that is about to be printed. When printing publications, the pages are never printed one at a time. Instead, multiple pages are printed on big sheets or webs of paper. These printed sheets of paper are then folded and trimmed. Imposition refers to the process of determining exactly how the pages need to be positioned and arranged on the sheets of paper to ensure that they will all be in the right order when the big sheet of paper is folded and trimmed to it's final size. A folded and trimmed sheet of paper made up of many different pages is called a signature. In a book, for example, signatures consisting of multiple pages are bound together to create the book. Imposition isn't something the designer or production artist needs to figure out. Instead it's handled by the printer. The designer does, however, need to be aware of the process and produce artwork that takes into consideration the number of pages in the signatures. In a magazine, for example, the total number of pages in the magazine ideally corresponds to the most efficient number of pages in each signature.</div>

It's a difficult program to learn, and I'd strongly recommend taking a class if you can. And don't forget there's more than type. You need to learn how to set up pages, place photos, run type around photos, handle colors, and many other things.

> paginating the text

If you're referring to putting the pages in the proper order for printing, a professional print shop will usually do that for you. It's part of the pre-press process as they prepare the file for printing. You'd prepare it as "reader spreads", which means it looks the way it'll look when printed and assembled. The printer will re-arrange the pages. (If you're using a print shop for the first time, ask to make sure they'll do this for you.)</div>

@JamesM, thank you! I have some experience with InDesign. In my speech I made such account to <em>paginating</em> because in Russian this word ("верстать") means everything you do with your layout: typesetting, formatting, aligning and arranging text and pictures, etc. Not only dividing content into discrete pages. On the other hand we almost never use the verb <em>to typeset</em> ("набирать"). We don't have such professional occupation as a typesetter now ("наборщик"). But we call a person who makes layout <em>a paginator</em> ("верстальщик"). Perhaps, this word is more closer to the word <em>composer</em>...

Now these words and its meanings in Russian and English seem much clearer to me. Hope this thread will be helpful for some another translators!</div>
