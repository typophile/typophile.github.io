body: "I was sent a scan of the typeface Mediaeval-Kursiv from a 1930s Genzsch & Heyse
  specimen book, and noticed something interesting: up to the 20 point size the Italic
  angle is about 24 degrees, but the 28 point Italic (the largest shown) is about
  18 degrees.\r\n\r\nI can see how that can make sense, and I'm wondering if there
  are other such cases.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Italic is ~15 degrees while the display's is ~18 degrees.  Based on this:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/JamesToddDesign/status/341331468628422658/photo/1\r\nBut
    note that this is the opposite of G&H's Mediaeval-Kursiv!\r\n\r\nWe need to think

  body: 'Whether one varies the italic angle at all, or in which manner one varies
    it, must depend on the individual design and what your intentions are, especially
    at the smaller sizes: is one trying to emphasise the ''italicness'' of the letters
    by slanting them more, or is one trying to improve the legitibility of the letters
    by making them more open and less compressed and hence slanting them less? One
    can easily conceive, surely, that a sloped roman type of italic would benefit
    from more slanting at smaller sizes, while a highly cursive design might benefit
    from less slanting at smaller sizes. At display sizes, everything is pretty much
    a matter of style and aesthetics.'

  body: "It is indeed more complex than it seems. It involves what I call the \"drama
    axis\", plus the extent to which an Italic should be stand-alone versus subordinate.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    thanks to Lars Schwarz* here's a scan of that G&H face (with the captions aligned

    is 20-28 point a sensical cut-off for text-versus-display?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: What if this doesn't come from a design, but a technical background? Maybe
    the 28pt wasn't properly fitting on the body?

  body: There could be any number of reasons for the difference in italic angle at
    this size, to do with technical capabilities as Lars suggests, or even involvement
    of particular customer requirements.

  body: "Lars, do you mean that the larger size(s) slant less because the (metal)
    kerns might break? Except <em>smaller</em> sizes are actually more prone to breakage;

  body: "Hrant: <em>You don't mean that a customer will specify an Italic angle variance,
    do you?</em>\r\n\r\nNot exactly. Consider that some sizes of a type might only
    exist because a particular customer requested them and paid for their manufacture.
    So while it is unlikely to be a case of a customer specifying a variance in the
    italic angle, it could be a case of a particular customer having requested an
    italic style of a particular slant for the size they needed, and then that being
    incorporated into the family <em>despite the italic angle variance.</em> These
    things happen.\r\n\r\nWith regard to technical constraints, consider the possibility
    that the casting equipment might have a horizontal aperture limit, meaning that
    as italic type gets taller it needs to be steeper in order for the widest letters
    to fit within the manufacturing width limit.\r\n\r\nI don't know if either of
    these possibilities is the case: one would need access to the company archives
    in order to determine the reason for the variance."
