body: "Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc. a leading global provider of text imaging solutions,
  today announced it has completed its acquisition of Bitstream Inc.'s font business
  in an all cash merger valued at approximately $50 million, subject to adjustments
  based on the closing net asset value of the company. \r\n\r\n\"This is a great day
  in our history,\" said Doug Shaw, president and chief executive officer of Monotype
  Imaging. \"Our mission is to be the first place to turn for typefaces, technology
  and expertise that enable the best user experience and ensure brand integrity regardless
  of device, platform or language. We're excited to welcome Bitstream's team of experts
  to Monotype Imaging \u2014 professionals who care as passionately about type as
  we do.\" \r\n\r\nMonotype Imaging's global reach and financial strength, combined
  with Bitstream's strong online font store and OEM business, position Monotype Imaging
  to serve broader markets, while addressing a wider range of customer needs. The
  acquisition is expected to strengthen Monotype Imaging's products and services,
  while providing customers with improved choice and flexibility. \r\n\r\nIncluded
  in the acquisition is the popular MyFonts.com(sm) website, featuring 89,000 fonts
  from nearly 900 foundries, in addition to the widely used WhatTheFont(sm) identification
  service. The transaction also includes the Bitstream\xAE typeface library, the company's
  Font Fusion\xAE and Bitstream Panorama\u2122 font rendering and layout technologies,
  a range of fonts for embedded and mobile environments, and 10 patents. Thirteen
  employees from Bitstream's U.S. operations, in addition to 42 Bitstream engineers
  and type designers who work in Noida, India, are joining Monotype Imaging, providing
  the company with an expanded global presence. \r\n\r\nExpected financial impact
  from the acquisition of Bitstream's font business \r\n\r\nBased on the timing of
  the close of the acquisition of Bitstream's font business, Monotype Imaging expects
  the financial impact to be immaterial to the first quarter of 2012 and is reiterating
  the financial guidance that was provided on Feb. 16, 2012. For the first quarter,
  the company continues to expect revenue in the range of $32.5 million to $34.0 million,
  non-GAAP net adjusted EBITDA in the range of $13.5 million to $14.5 million, GAAP
  earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.15 to $0.17 and non-GAAP earnings
  per diluted share in the range of $0.21 to $0.23. \r\n\r\nFor the full year 2012,
  Monotype Imaging expects Bitstream's font business to contribute approximately $13.0
  million to $14.0 million in revenue and $2.0 million to $3.0 million in net adjusted
  EBITDA. The full year 2012 impact from the Bitstream acquisition includes the purchase
  accounting write-down of deferred revenue, the alignment of Bitstream's revenue
  recognition policies with Monotype Imaging's policies and integration costs. Total
  revenue is now expected to be in the range of $146.0 million to $151.0 million,
  up from prior guidance of $133.0 million to $137.0 million. Net adjusted EBITDA
  is now expected to be in the range of $59.0 million to $63.0 million, up from prior
  guidance of $57.0 million to $60.0 million. The acquisition is expected to be neutral
  to GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.68 to $0.73, and non-GAAP
  earnings per diluted share is now expected to be in the range of $0.96 to $1.01,
  up from prior guidance of $0.93 to $0.98. \r\n\r\nA reconciliation of GAAP measures
  to non-GAAP measures for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and the full year
  2012 is provided in the financial tables that accompany this release. \r\n\r\nConference
  call details \r\n\r\nMonotype Imaging will host a conference call for financial
