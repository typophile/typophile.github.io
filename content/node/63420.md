  collective is called Rawflava, what means more or less pure gold.\r\n\r\nI thought
  about something simple and friendly and it should look good in print and on screen.\r\n\r\nThen
  I started searching something in symbolism about interpretation of gold and I found
  that in the past people were using same symbol for \r\nSun and gold.\r\n\r\nI'm
  still not 100% sure about it, so I'm asking you for critique (mainly on rythm and
  kerning).\r\n\r\nSorry for my bad english.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdas\r\n\r\n"

    would help in seeing if the wordmark fits.\r\nFor me rawflava reads as an amalgamation
    of raw and flavour with an 'urban' slant.\r\nInitially the circular symbol seems
    to be a target and thus seems to be disconnected from the name concepulaly and
    looks out of place.\r\n\r\nWil"

    which is a very big retail company. Something to consider depending on whom your
    friends are going to be working with.

    to look at it from another angle: the Symbol for Gold is AU (Aurium is Gold in
    Greek. \r\n\r\nPlacing a semi-circular-type A over U could still create a similar
    logo mark, but more unique..?\r\n\r\nnagfa"

    client base? The name seems rather ghetto for a design collective, unless they
    do hip hop albums and gold foil graphic tees. \r\n\r\nAre you included in this
    design collective with your friends? If not, I question why you're designing their
    logo for them if they do identity work.\r\n\r\npenn"

    I think the typeface and treatment can be as cornball as you want given the name.

    We know each other for several of years and they liked my older works so asked
