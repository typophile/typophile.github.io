  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>hello typophiles</p>
<p>if this thread belongs to the licensing-subforum, please move it moderators, i wasnt sure .</p>
<p>im asking myself the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>i found ITC magnifico in several different stores from fontshop to fonts.com, etc.. the prices range from 30€ up to 45$ for exactly the same font.</li>
<li>in <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=magnifico">fontshop</a>, there&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=ITC.108270.0.0">one copy by ITC</a> and then there&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.106143.0.0">one thats 8€ less</a> but appears to have exactly the same characterset - what now?</li>
<li>the monotype/itc-shop is the only one which sells the <a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.aspx?PID=205028">opentype-version</a> - does anybody know if there&rsquo;s any difference between the normal TT/PS-font and the OT-version? its 15$ more, so i&rsquo;d only get it if it really has some &ldquo;special&rdquo; features.</li>
</ul>
<p>i find it very disappointing that, unlike many others, im ready to pay for fonts even if i&rsquo;ll just use it in my freetime, but then i have to look around hours just to find the reseller that gives me the best price while not having exact information on different versions. or is there anything else i should take into consideration when chosing a shop? (im from switzerland if that matters..)</p>
<p>thanks for any help! im a bit lost with this question..</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just like any software product, pricing will vary according to the vendor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at essentially the same font, available from different foundries. The Creative Alliance version was licensed from ITC by Monotype and they chose to sell it at a different price. Now that Monotype owns the ITC collection it seems strange that they still offer it through both foundries, I know.</p>
<p>The OpenType version is sometimes priced higher for no other reason than it offers simplicity (1 file) and cross-platformability (Mac and Windows). For some folks, this convenience is worth a few extra bucks.</p>
<p>I understand a bit of confusion in seeing the same font data for different fees, but I have to ask: you&rsquo;re spending hours to save $15? That&rsquo;s not too grand a price break.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>stephen, thanks alot for your reply and thanks for your insight on those foundry-stories.</p>
<p>its clear to me that any vendor decides how he wants to sell and price his products, i have a business education :). what really annoys me is the fact that there&rsquo;s no clear and structured information about different releases or some kind of meta-search / froogle where one could find all possible vendors for a specific font. well, maybe thats a business idea on its own :)</p>
<p>its 30$ because its two fonts, and yes, 30$ are enough for me spend a few minutes searching - im doing an internship, not a well paid job, and afterall, this is for personal use, not for paid jobs.</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s anybody here that knows of a even better deal than the fontshop-32$-version? im just asking, if not, i&rsquo;ll probably get that one.</p>
