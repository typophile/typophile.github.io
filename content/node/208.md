body: Yes, we are suggesting some new names for this italian ice lounge to be located
  on Mill Avenue in Arizona... But any comments on this first iteration of the logo?
  It&#39;s based off the client&#39;s drawings.. I&#39;m definately going to tighten
  up the type and maybe add some more flourishes, but any comments on the general
  color and feel? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11044.gif"

  body: 'Depth of field issue. What if the top scoop was larger that the bottom giving
    the impression of the icecream cone coming toward the viewer? &#34;Desserts Lounge&#34;
    seems too large, a little bit anyway. That word, hum, how about just &#34;Dessert
    Lounge&#34;? That typeface isn&#39;t having much fun on the round. What about
    something a little looser? LetterError&#39;s Kosmik? or Cafeteria from Font Bureau?
    The asterisks seem too decorative to be acting like bullets, maybe? The large
    stroke around the centermost red circle seems too thick. All in all, however,
    a fun and simple solution. -- and the colors seem appropriate given the name.

  body: 'Ok. so maybe The type is just not letterspaced enough. I just played with
    Anisette, some would say a geometric face, and it seemed perfectly content on
    the curve, but I had to letterspace is enough, not groteskly, just enough. So
    that is another font I suggest, Anisette by JFP &#40;<a href="http://typofonderie.com"
    target="_blank">http://typofonderie.com</a>&#41; I was trying to make you a sample
    when my illustrator bit the dust for the millionth time today.  <BR> <BR>Maybe
    I&#39;m wrong, I just don&#39;t feel like your type has any passion or emotion
    or humor. Sorry. '

  body: This seems too slick for my taste. Not  <BR>knowing the answers to Hrants
    questions, but I&#39;d think a more &#34;old world&#34; look would be  <BR>appropriate
    &#40;it can still have broad appeal&#41;. This really looks like it was drawn
    on a  <BR>computer, where as the feeling I&#39;m wanting to see has a human touch.
    The cone more  <BR>illustrative. The type a little looser, maybe a serif with
    a swash cap and alternate ending &#40;poetica?&#41;.  <BR>Better yet. Draw up
    some letters. Or if you&#39;re not ready for that yet, print some out and trace  <BR>over
    them. Then hand set it around the circle. Anything to make it more human. Also,
    take a  <BR>look at the dashes around the edge. Replace it with something more
    interesting. Loops or  <BR>floral or something.  <BR> <BR>IMHO, too much love
    goes into gelatto to be represented be a mechanical logo. <BR> <BR>Good luck,
    <BR>Randy

    <BR> <BR>The logo in the upper left. That&#39;s kind of what I&#39;m seeing for
    this project. Dunno if that helps. <BR> <BR>Randy'

  body: Thanks for your comments... I was hoping this would be an ongoing critique
    and I could take your comments and my own intentions and work towards a better
    solution, but... since I was sub-contracted for this job, I have no say or direct
    contact with the client and I have been told they decided to go with a very literal
    translation of the owner&#39;s drawings... Which are crap... Oh well. <BR> <BR>As
    I mentioned, this is for a store on Mill Ave. in Tempe, AZ.. a busy old-style
    downtown type of atmosphere... I agree it definately needs an illustrative touch...
    Hopefully someone gives them a clue before it&#39;s too late.

  body: If you can, perhaps you can give them the clue.  Playing off of Randy&#39;s
    comments I see someting handrawn &#40;like the signage you see on corner stores/bodegas&#41;
    combining that with something sans for Dessert Lounge.  Sort of like what Krispy
    Kreme does. <BR> <BR>Good Luck
