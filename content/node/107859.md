  body: "Hi devaj,\r\n\r\nThat's a strange request \"What fonts contains exact width
    and thickness of the curves of the letter G\". I don't think I understand what
    that really means?\r\n\r\nWell, it seems to have been modified a little bit, with
    that flat top, but I would start out with the \"G\" from Microgramma Bold Extended,
    designed by Aldo Novarese and Alessandro Butti for the Nebiolo Type Foundry in
    1952. A similar font done by Aldo Novarese was Eurostile about ten years later.
    Although this whole logo comprises of just regular curves and straight lines -
    nothing difficult here - you could redraw the thing in 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps!\r\nRegards\r\nDoghouse\r\n\r\n"
