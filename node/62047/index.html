  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all.

I'm very new here, and I've seen the productive and constructive discussions here.

I'd like to share a concept logo of 'one', derived from the digits 2 and 3. Any suggestions to improve this..?

i was thinking the same thing about the E...except perhaps doing that really does make it read as an E and not a 3. i don't think we'll know til we see it. but then choosing a different font may solve the problem also--which could probably be done since it appears to me the 2 and the 3 are from different worlds; one is pointy, one is soft.

i actually read one immediately, the 1-2-3 didn't present itself to me. maybe i shouldn't have read the text above, but then, maybe i shouldn't have to.

i do think it's clever & there's definitely something to this.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was looking at it again and must admit that I'm still stunned by the idea but there are some details that makes it too much "2" and "3" and too little "one".

To make it "one" as well as "2" and "3" I'd suggest you to first take "2" and "3" and positioning them the way you want them and then overlay them with "O N E" to tweak the numbers into letters.

Since it's a little hard to explain I've prepared a little mock-up. Hopefully you don't mind since it's just for explanation and showing you what I mean. In this case I choose Avenir 95 since it's very geometric and has some nice numbers but I think that you can use this technique for any kind of typeface.

I hope this helps you. Keep on going and I think you will end up having a great logo.

		<div class="commentbody">Firstly, thank you for the positive comments. Humbled. 

@Evanbrog: You're spot on when you deduced by sheer observation that the two digits were from different worlds. The 3 was a nondescript Impact, if I remember correctly, while the side-laying 2 was conjured. Personally, I did not notice the pointy-soft subtle differences in the two digit-'types', so it was a lesson learnt. Thank you.

@Simplicious: It is interesting that Evanbrog saw 'ONE' and you saw '2-3'. That both means that the logo is not quite successsul as the balance between form and function was not, er, balanced. ") Your take on a different '3', and then the execution of an alternative logo is very, very appreciated. I agree that the lopsided-bottom heavy '3' eschewed the reading of an E. Your version kind of wrapped up the logo nicely. The concept is similar, but that end product: breath-taking. Not sure if there could be any improvement to be added. 

thank you,
nagfa

That's exactly what I was thinking, but then I started to realize that this might be the reason why I read it as "2" and "3". The first thing I've seen was a flipped "3" -- simply because it has to little in common with a typical "E" -- which is the main reason why the shape of "on" isn't too important because it will always be perceived as "2" only because it makes sense, seeing a "2" on the left side of a "3". And since in the original post the logo is called "one" I think it's important to read "one" at first and then realize -- after you've analyzed the wordmark -- that the word is actually made up from "2" and "3". This kind of adds an element of surprise while otherwise it might appear a little "conflicted" and maybe slightly awkward.

Nevertheless I totally agree with riccard0's "emotional impact" of a top-heavy "E" and epsilicon's 90 degree turns, but I'm not sure if this two bonuses are more important then a good readability. In a perfect world you might be able to combine "emotional impact", 90 degree turns and readability. I wish you all the best for this and I think the cleverness of the idea should be motivation enough for you to design something better then our two versions.</div>
