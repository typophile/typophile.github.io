  decided to post here, sorry if late been horribly busy.\r\nAnyway.\r\nAm hoping
  that I can some of you here to help me out with this one logo I have.\r\nThe logo
  is for a design firm called \"Votekick Web Developments, LLC\", I have been using
  this logo for some time now and have never went to any levels to improve it. More
  or less at the time decided it would work and have stuck with it ever since. But
  am ready to rework the idea and make it stick this time.\r\nWas wandering if you
  all could help me see what I am missing with this image. I have been told that the
  image almost looks like mountains, stream and moon.\r\nI see this too but have had
  not been able to work with own personal logo.\r\nAnyone that can help with this
  would be awesome.\r\nThe \"V\" in this image is what is being said to look like
  mountains while the swoosh looking image below it is the said water with the dot
  above being the moon. But this isn't what it was intended to look like.\r\n\r\nI
  was at the time going for a web 2.0 look and feel while emphasizing a professional
  presentation.\r\nI have been doing this type of work for many years now and am very
  successful at conveying what the clients want through imagery, but this one since
  is my own has me stuck.\r\nCan ya help me out? Thanks in advance. ;-)"

    be picked up, but maybe that's just me. What is it supposed to look like anyway?
    I don't see anything web- or design related in it.\r\nFirst thing that bothers
    me about it is the diagonal rectangle/diamond shape. It just seems a little outdated.
    Instead I'd start off with a new leaf & try working with a more fluent image if
    you now what I mean. Maybe just a letterlogo will suffy?"

  body: "I think the colors and 3D-look say Web2.0, but it looks outdated to me. \r\n\r\nOne
    small thing that bothered me right away: the drop shadow should not be on the
    lower-left side of the square based on the direction of the other shadows.\r\n\r\nI
    wouldn't say you have to start over completely - you should keep the square shape
    and the colors because you have used them for so many years. Why not change the
    mountain/wave/moon shape to just a simple V?\r\n\r\nAnd I would change the gradient:
    either lose it all together, or make it look more 3D/reflective (read: cliche
    web2.0). Right now, it looks like a plain gradient and I think my eye wants to
    see it in 3D but can't.\r\n\r\nI will try playing around in Photoshop if I have
    some downtime at work today and post what I'm picturing.\r\n\r\n-Scott"

    suggest you design initially in 2d mono, get your proportions/juxtapostions to
    work and then '3d' it.\r\n\r\n"
