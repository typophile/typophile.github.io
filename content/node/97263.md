body: "Hey guys\r\nI am working on a font in fontlab studio v5 and suddenly a glyph
  of mine stopped getting displayed in the preview window. And it happens such that
  if i keep a / before it, then it gets previewed. Also I had noticed that when i
  change the display properties of the glyph cells in the glyph page from name to
  unicode.. nothing happens. None of the glyphs  have unicode assigned to them. Now
  to preview any character, i have to use a / character before it. What happened?\r\n"

  body: "@Karl\r\nNow all characters..No character's unicode is being displayed. If
    i put it in names mode, the name of the glyph is appearing on the glyph cell ,
    but if i am using unicode mode nothing is happening. Also after opening the glyph
    in its own window, when i right click and go to properties, the name field displays
    the name but the unicode field is blank for all the glyphs. I tried to assign
    it unicode by clicking the emerald colored diamond shaped icon but nothing happened.\r\n"

  body: But it would be good to know which characters this is happening with, for
    example could you show the behaviour of the lower-case A (0061)? In your screen
    grab none of the characters displayed have glyphs in them and so it is difficult
    to get a feel for which encoding set-up and what characters you are working with.

  body: I think i had solved it. I changed the encoding to default and also when i
    quadruple click on a glyph cell, the Unicode number appears. So i guess that settles
    the problem.

  body: "Glyph names are mapped to Unicode values using the .nam files stored in  the
    FontLan/Shared/Mapping folder. By default, FontLab's 'Standard Table' is used,
    which is based on the Adobe Glyph List and uniXXXX algorithm. It is possible to
    create custom .nam files, which are helpful if you want to employ custom mnemonic
    names during development instead of uniXXXX names for scripts not covered in the
    Adobe list. If Unicodes are not being automatically assigned to newly created
    glyphs, it is an indicator that there is a mismatch between the current .nam file
    being referenced by FontLab and the glyph names you are using. Select 'Generate
    Unicode' from the Glyph\\Glyph Names menu to activate an appropriate .nam file.\r\n\r\n[Note
    that if using custom .nam files, every once in a while FontLab will revert to
    is Standard Table. I've never figured out what triggers this.]"
