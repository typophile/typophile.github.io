  I can never seem to find a category to put Vendome in. Actually, there are a few
  that I have problems with. Alcuin would be another.\r\n\r\nWhere would you put Vendome,
  thinking in classical type categorization terms? "

  body: That's about right, though I have trouble applying the term "Renaissance"
    to something designed in the twentieth century. I prefer Christian Schwartz's
    description, <a href=http://christianschwartz.com/vendome.shtml>"an aggressively
    spiky Garamond."</a>

    a typeface purely for display. But I hear of it being used for body copy, which
    sounds strange to me.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "My basic classifications are mostly functional classifications: sans-serif,
    text-serif, square-serif, modern/transitional, monospace, ornaments, display.\r\n\r\nCompletely
    non-scientific, but it works for my purposes. I have some overlap between square-serif
    and text-serif, such as which one do I put Charter into? The answer is both.\r\n\r\nBut
    Vendome doesn't fit any of those classes. Maybe I should make a category for spiky-serif.
    Then I would have a good place to deposit Warnock."

    spikeyness is not particularly apparent in the lower case.\r\nAlso consider production
    situations that erode detail, where a sharp finish preempts loss of detail. \r\n\r\nAnd
    note that the serifs are actually blunted (same thing with Novarese's Symbol,
    Times Roman, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The \"spiky\" triangular/wedge serifs are the defining characteristic of
    the Latin sub-group of serifed typefaces. Vendome, Warnock, Meridien, ITC Veljovic,
    and a whole bunch of typefaces with \"Latin\" in the name (Latin Elongated/Condensed,
    etc.) all fall into this category.\r\n\r\nThere's an open question as to how blunt
    the end can get before you consider it something else, I suppose. Warnock makes
    the question trickier because the degree of bluntness depends on the optical size....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Back in the late '80s or early '90s, Richard Eckersley designed a book in
    Vendome that we set using a Linotron 202. Best I can remember, the only Vendome
    fonts available were the 18-point master. With that master size, they were a little
    thin and tightly-spaced at test size. We could fix the tight letterfit somewhat,
    but it all in all, it still looked like a display face used for text. I wonder
    how much of the \"display only\" feeling has to do with the master sizes used
    for photocomp & digitizations.\r\n\r\nFWIW "
