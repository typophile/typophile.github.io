body: "I'm new to font design and have made a dingbats font with just a few characters
  for use in both the print and ebook versions of a book I'm preparing to publish.
  I have one particularly complex glyph that prints beautifully and displays perfectly
  in InDesign CS3, but looks terrible in MS Word (2004 for Mac), and kind of muddy
  in a high-quality PDF produced through InDesign.\r\n\r\nSince the glyph prints fine,
  I'm not worried about it for the print book, but I am concerned about how it will
  display in ebooks on various platforms. (I can't change the design of the glyph,
  since it relates to something in the story.)\r\n\r\nI've autohinted the font the
  glyph is in using an older version of FontForge [from 2009, since I couldn't figure
  out how to install it without the help of a (now dated) package].\r\n\r\nI don't
  know enough about font design to hint the glyph manually -- and I'm not sure if
  that would help, since the glyph displays perfectly in InDesign. The other glyphs
  in the font seem adequate to me in all contexts -- but they are much simpler in
  design.\r\n\r\nI'd welcome any suggestions as to how I can make sure this glyph
  preforms properly in ebooks!\r\n\r\nHere's a link to an image that will make it
  clear what I'm talking about:  \r\n\r\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/7423/problemswithglyph.png\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help you can offer!"

    an image?

  body: "1. InDesign probably uses its own auto-hinting mechanism -- it comes with
    an \"Adobe Cooltype\" DLL.\r\n\r\n2. You can only use your custom font in epub
    viewers that support font embedding.\r\n\r\n3. Those devices that <em>do</em>
    support font embedding and custom fonts may use different hinting mechanisms,
    ranging from 'none at all' (if they mainly rely on their own built-in fonts being
    optimized for their own screen) to, uh, well probably nothing as advanced as the
    Adobe Cooltype you see in InDesign. In other words, YMMV.\r\n\r\nThat said, I
    would say you are correct in your estimation it's just the on-screen hinting that
    muddles the glyphs. Can you see the quality varying if you zoom in and out in
    a PDF?\r\n\r\n(After looking at your sample image:)\r\n\r\nOuch. Frode may be
    right as well."

  body: "frode frank, the answer to your question, \"Why is this not represented by
    an image?\" may be -- Because I'm new to this? The image is used repeatedly as
    a small, decorative element, and I thought it might be simpler to include it within
    a font and embed it, rather than deal with different picture-formating requirements
    in different ebook formats. Since I was making a dingbats font, anyway, I decided
    to include it. I had no idea that the complexity of the image would be a problem.\r\n\r\nTheunis
    de Jong, the information that you gave is helpful and interesting. And, yes, the
    image does clear up beautifully if I zoom in on it in a PDF.\r\n\r\nNick Shinn
    -- thanks, also, for your input.\r\n\r\nI gather from what you've all said that
    this image is just too complex to display well on screen as a glyph in most situations.
    It sounds like the best choice is to go back to presenting it as a raster image.\r\n\r\nI've
    also made a handwriting font for one of the characters (for presenting a few brief
    passages that are supposed to be written by hand). If I could figure out how to
    install the latest version of FontForge, would the autohinting in it be enough
    better than it was in the 2009 version to be worth the trouble? Or would there
    be no more than a small improvement, anyway?\r\n\r\nThank you again for all the
    help!"

  body: If these passages are meant to <em>exactly</em> represent existing handwriting,
    I would not try any font tricks with that either. If you do it all depends on
    the user's reading hardware and software what he/she will see. Play it safe, and
    embed these passages as images as well.

  body: "That sounds like sound advice. However, the handwriting font is meant to
    be suggestive of the character's handwriting, but more legible than handwriting
    is likely to be. I think it is working well as a font, as far as that goes, and
    would allow for fluid resizing of text by the reader of an ebook. I realize that
    some older ebook reading devices will display their default font in place of the
    handwriting font\u2014and for that reason, I have defined the handwriting font
    as an italic, as I presume that in those cases the default font will then display
    its italic style, which will then still be distinct from the surrounding text.
    I can live with that in exchange for the benefits of fluid resizing and a smaller
    file size overall.\r\n\r\nRegardless, your point is well taken, and I do appreciate
    your advice. I certainly think it would be the thing to do if the handwriting
    were meant to be an exact representation.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hinting makes sense when there is a(n optical) system, like for example in
    the Latin alphabet where similar widths are supposed to look uniform and similar
    heights are supposed to align.\r\n\r\nHandwriting fonts can definitely benefit
    from hinting, but only in some situations. Sometimes drawing within the constraints
    makes more sense. Feel free to PM me if you need any help with your project!"

    has changed recently, InDesign does NOT use an auto-hinting mechanism. It uses
    the hints built into the font. However, CoolType is InDesign's own font rendering
    engine (among other things).\r\n"
