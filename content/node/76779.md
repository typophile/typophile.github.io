  body: I recognise it to the level of having seen it before. First I thought Luxi,
    but it has square dots. Lido STF Cond is a write-off, too; it has ball terminals.
    Finally I thought it might be some kind of a Palatino, but WTH kind of Pally looks
    like a Times? Seeing that it was time to actually <em>think,</em> I gave up.

    lends credence to that, @Lex.\r\n\r\nPS: Paratype has it as Troover and MyFonts
    as TS Toledo."
