    for, so to best answer the OP, I'd want to ask <italics>where</italics> do you
    want it to look like during the 18th century? ex: people in italy had different
    lettering needs than people in germany, and they were incredibly isolated, so
    their printing \"fonts\" were thick in mimicry but lack hybridization.  (language>
    usage>design elements to consider) \r\n\r\nOtherwise, something blackletter to
    some sort of double stroked calligraphic I'd imagine would be convincing, like
    \ some sort of 'Ye Olde' truetype. \r\n\r\nOr, you're going Latin. "

    was this complex, haha. Let's say I'm loosely aiming for central Europe... If
    you need something more specified, let's say France and/or Great Brittain. And
    oh, I'm looking for some sort of  \"printed\" font, not a calligraphy one (I'll
    probably just write those parts myself). \r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"

  body: "I know this sounds like I am nit-picking\u2026\r\nBut France and UK are definitely
    not \u201CCentral Europe\u201D. I would say that term discribes the area from
    Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary, Czech Rep., Slovakia, northern Balkan, maybe
    western parts of Belarus, Ukraine, Romania. \r\nThere terms are anyhow socially
    constructed, as is the whole concept of Europe itself. Which is why I see it as
    even more important to include former Warsaw-Pact countries, to shape a new European
    understanding, which adopts the new integrated reality. \r\n"

  body: "You say you are \"designing an event taking place in the mid to late 18th
    century and I need to use some fonts from back then.\" Any signs would have been
    hand lettered in a wide variety of styles. Printed material, books, handbills,
    newspapers would have used type. We are talking about type with serifs, not sans-serif.
    18th century printed pages may look lighter, i.e. less black compared to white,
    than 19th & 20th century pages. In the mid 18th century it's too early to use
    \"modern\" i.e. high contrast faces such as Didot or Bodoni. Printer's had a large
    stock of \"old style\" faces, which varied by country.  Something like Adobe Garamond
    would work for most countries in the 18th century. Typefaces that we now classify
    as \"transitional\" or \"baroque\" are are good for representing the Enlightenment
    movement. Consider Plantin, everywhere, and for England, Caslon and Baskerville.
    Fleischman's Dutch designs were widely imitated in most countries during the last
    quarter of the 18th century. Bodoni light to medium weights can be used for fashionable
    texts from the 1780's onward. Revolutionary France can use Didot. For text in
    Germany and Germanic influenced areas of central and eastern Europe, Fraktur for
    politics and popular texts, \"Antiqua\" i.e. the serifed Roman types, was used
    for scientific papers. \r\nBTW this is written on the fly. It's not the word of
    God.\r\nGood luck with your project.\r\nDon"
