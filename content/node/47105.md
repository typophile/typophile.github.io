    Either the lowercases have to get smaller where appropriate, or glyph substitution
    has to help here, or glyph substitution has to help in all-cap settings. \"Shakespeare\"
    in the the cited proof and the word \"Search\", in the current FF Pitu, of this

    typography is an uneasy mixture, there's a new custom font for headlines, which
    they're calling Sunday Times Modern. I don't know yet who's responsible and it's
    an odd-looking thing with a Dutch feel, somewhat calligraphic but with aggressive
    spiky serifs. The bolder weights are not so bad, but the light looks awful.</a>\r\n\r\n\u2014K"

    relatively narrow, but for me it's not a problem.\r\n\r\nIf I'm not extend more
    is because is very difficult to me explain it:\r\n\r\nFor me, a wide 'Ss' often
    look deformed or with a \"dynamic of curve\" that does not match with the rest
    of characters. \r\n\r\nAnd the fact that there are characters that are separated
    a bit from the \"norm\" or the \"proportions\" make the design more original,
    and for me (I repeat) it's not a problem, if it works in words is an advantage,
    a differentiator.\r\nI believe that internal whites work well with the rest of
    letters, the weight is appropriate, curves seem from the same family, etc.\r\n\r\nMy
    job was to find ways to innovate and make an original typeface,\r\na conservative
    approach would not be appropriate in this case...\r\n\r\nIt is only my approach,

    blog post today, this one by the redesign's designer, Al Trivino, who imparts
    some interesting info on the evolution of Sunday Times Modern and the section
    typography:</a>\r\n\r\n\"We started by dropshaped serifs, but we quickly changed
    to curved and polygonal serifs to create a stronger, beefier font, more in accordance
    with the type of newspaper the editors want to produce each Sunday. Also to innovate
    and to break the mold. When one compares it to the most often used fonts in the
    UK, Sunday Times looks robust and unique. We achieved that.\""

    I don\u2019t think it is very \u201CDutch\u201D as Mr Porter says; I think of
    Quadraat when I think of Dutch serifs; Sunday Times Modern seems more energetic
    while also compact. The <em>S</em> connects well to earlier types bearing the
    Times name (with the exception of Europa).\r\n\r\n<strong>Jack Yan</strong>\r\n[[http://jackyan.com]]"
