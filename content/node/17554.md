    have been\r\nthe name of Mesrob Mashdots's top disciple, who went on to write\r\nhis
    biography and detail the creation of the Armenian alphabet.\r\nSo whether he ends
    up a jock or a bookworm we're covered.  :-)\r\n\r\n* The usual transliteration
    is \"Goryoun\", and \"Gorune\"\r\nis more common in some countries (like France)
    but we\r\ndecided on the Google-unique \"Goryune\" last minute.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    is that's just an -unfortunate- coincidence.  :-)\r\n\r\nStuart, Hrad is indeed
    delighted... although you can see the\r\ntwinge of ambivalence... The trick I
    guess is to get the older\r\nkid to help with the newborn, to avoid too much jealousy.\r\nHmmm,
    you think Hrad can start driving Goryune to\r\npreschool in three years?  ;->\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    guys, back to type, eh?\r\nEventually when my boys jump\r\nin they'll spin their
    own stories\r\nand show their own images!  ;-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    before jealousy rears its ugly head - This will temper the level it may reach
    let's say - You will see first hand how passive aggresive behavior develops in
    the coming 3-6 months . . .\r\n\r\nThen they'll be perfect little play buddies
    - Till then just as before - sleep when the baby does . . .\r\n\r\n:D"
