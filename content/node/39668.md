body: Hello typomaniacs, any idea what the font used for "Cloverfield" might be? I
  thought either Reykjavik or Metroflex, but I don't think it's either one of those.
  Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cloverfield_5223.jpg]

  body: Yeah, I was wondering about that one myself. I think it might be a PrimeType
    font, something like PTL Notes or something. Lemmecheck.
