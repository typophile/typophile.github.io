  and now that I'm getting more serious about this, I find it kind of hard to actually
  start off because I don't know  what the recommended workflow is. Are you supposed
  to create the shape in Fontlab or is it actually common to design the outlines in
  illustrator or inkscape, for example (these two seem to have a better range of tools
  for this task)? I've seen a lot of videos where people create the basic shapes in
  illustrator and export them to Fontlab later on.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

    choice. But there are quite a few drawbacks compared to working directly in a
    font editor:\r\n\r\n- Conversion of outlines from Illustrator's floating point
    coordinated to integer values in a font editor (which are required by standard
    font formats) requires careful inspection for rounding errors.\r\n- More steps
    involved, compared to drawing directly in a font editor.\r\n- No way to effectively
    work on spacing in Illustrator in a way that will carry over to the font editor.\r\n-
    Paths from Illustrator often need cleaning up in the font editor.\r\n\r\nIn general,
    it's faster and more efficient to work on a font directly in a font editor. That's
    what they were made for, whereas Illustrator was not.\r\n\r\nIf you do prefer
    working in Illustrator anyway, ScanFont provides a good, fast way to get the outlines
    into FontLab from Illustrator, although it's still more work than working in a
    font editor from the start.\r\n\r\n(This is coming from someone who used to do
    his drawing in Illustrator.)"

    comfortable with that for the time being and to help you get started. FontLab
    Studio has a pretty high learning curve and takes some getting used to. Just remember
    to place all your points in Illustrator on integer values and you should be fine
    -- precision is the key. Do your art so it does not require scaling once it is
    in FonLab Studio.\r\n\r\nMore information about this on proper preparation of

  body: "Thanks, great advice!\r\n\r\nI was actually worrying about the precision
    of the paths made in illustrator myself, so thanks for confirming that. Judging
    from what you said, the import of illustrator data into FL seems rather time-consuming
    and not worth the effort. \r\n\r\nUsing the editing tools of FL is kind of hard
    for a beginner, though. As i said, their range seems to be rather small, but that's
    probably just a false impression.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I'll give it a try and see what's
    possible. \r\nCan someone tell me if there's an effective way to round corners?
    Something like a tool that enables you to \"chamfer\" (is that the right term?)
    sharp connections of existing shapes?"

  body: "Font editor drawing tools have a good pedigree.\r\nFontographer was the \uFB01rst
    desktop application to include a bezier-drawing tool, in 1986.\r\nIt was published
    by Altsys, which later released the drawing/layout app FreeHand in 1988, the same
    year Adobe released Illustrator, shortly before CorelDraw in 1989.\r\nFreehand
    was killed when Adobe acquired Macromedia, which had acquired Altsys, so its demise
    was not a re\uFB02ection of its quality vis-a-vis Illustrator.\r\nI used Illustrator
    from 1989 to 1996, when it underwent major changes (v.6) and a degree of bloat
    that made my skin crawl when I tried to adapt my mental software to handle it.
    Subsequently, like Jan, I\u2019ve done all my drawing in Fontographer/FontLab,
    and created almost all other graphics in Quark/InDesign, except for pie charts. "

      too have used Freehand, CorelDraw and Illustrator. (Freehand was ahead of it's
      time)\r\n\r\nI always believe that when a program crosses over without two much
      loss, do it.\r\n\r\nI come from the Toy Industry and you cannot design wildly
      original fresh Graphics in Quark or InDesign ....or a Font Editor ;-)\r\nLikewise
      with some Unique Type Design. You cannot always quickly create original Fonts
      in FontLab or Fontographer. These programs are too unforgiving. You can't cut,
      overlay, swap, add, remove, try multiple images next to each other, on top of
      each other, move art/images around, off pasteboards, or work as quick on many
      glyphs as you can in a Vector Program like Coreldraw or Illustrator. You guys
      forget that while the impression is that while Font Editors might be the end
      result of precision, the Vector based Programs can be the source of freedom,
      creativity and freshness.\r\n\r\nSome people use a pencil and paper. Some people
      like the speed and fluidity of Illustrator or Coreldraw to get a start on the
      final look of a typeface.\r\n\r\nEach to their own. (But if you want to produce
      a boring Travel Brochure use Quark/InDesign...DON'T do Graphics IN IT...do page
      layout instead!)\r\n\r\nIf you want to set your creativity free, don't go near
      a Font Editor first!"

  body: "@webfont   sorry for my answer's delay. The problem with icon fonts is to
    have them sharp in the browser, and only at a certain size or multiples. For instance
    if you want to use your web-icon in a text of 14px, you have to design it to be
    sharp at 14px, and of course 28, 42 etc.\r\nYou're obliged to work with a bigger
    grid, but you first have to calculate your grid spacing according to the base
    value of a font (UPM= Number of units per em square).\r\n\r\nIn brief, it\u2019s
    easier to draw into a type design software. Personally I use <a href=\"http://glyphsapp.com\"
    target=\"_blank\">Glyphs App</a>. It's very symple and draw tool excellent, compared
    to Illustrator. \r\nHere a tutorial about how to calculate the right values.\r\n
