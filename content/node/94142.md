  can't find a V that has a serif on the left and not a full serif on the right, that
  goes to the right. I see some that go to the left.\r\n\r\nPlease excuse the choppiness
  on the sides of the v, this is where there were graphics ... the actual font is
  not distressed.\r\n\r\nThank you, I'm thinking this is something obvious and I'm
  looking too hard!"

    body: It is part of a logo. Probably from a set of on computer fonts, I would
      think.

  body: "it's a long shot, but it could be also a Greek Letter \"\u03BD\" (pronounced
    'n'), horizontally mirrored...\r\nSee for example the /\u03BD/ of <strong>Rider
    Widest (Ultra-expanded Bold)</strong>:\r\nhttp://myfonts.us/td-tV37hD\r\n\r\nRider
    Widest is not an exact match off course, because after mirroring the right leg
    will be much thicker than the left, but you can get the overall idea...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greek_n_mirrored_5646.jpg]"
