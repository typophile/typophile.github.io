  body: URW Didoni is not only close it is pretty right on - also lists Phil Martin
    as the designer - his VGC had three weights of Pistilli Roman

  body: "John Pistilli was the designer of Pistilli Roman. As far as I know it is
    not available. I know for a fact a number of type designers have created versions
    of it for their clients.\r\n\r\nAlso that ampersand in the URW face is all wrong."

  body: Martin's Didoni, although obviously a knock-off of Pistilli Roman, had a zillion
    more characters (alternates and swashes), including the missing ampersand. The
    extra characters were the reason for its existence. Martin considered such fonts
    to have "added value" and did not see anything wrong with it. I don't think you
    could get away with this today, but it was not uncommon at the time. The irony
    is that the digital version is missing all of the "value added" stuff, leaving
    only the part that he copied (and not even all of that).
