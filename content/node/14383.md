  \ Nothing's done yet and any feed back would be much appreciated. Also, although
  I don't know anything about open type, I will be making an open typeface with lots
  of ligatures.\r\n\r\nf"

  body: "I think it has a lot of potential. It has a wonderful textural presence.
    I especially like the way the letters start to interact with each other. It needs
    more work, but has a start it good. It had some feeling of a script, without being
    a script typeface. The weights need to be more normalized and the addition of
    numerous ligatures could make it much more smooth and pleasing to view.\r\n\r\nshu\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think i agree! It makes me think of what <a href=\"http://www.ralphsteadman.com\">Ralph
    Steadman</a> might come up with if he set about to design a font like <a href=\"http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=734\">tension.</a>
    \ That said, keeping some of the ridiculous variation in weight within the individual
    glyphs but maybe going for more consistancy with this through the entire typeface
    might be a good direction.. (now that i've said that, i think i'm probably just
    re-iterating shu)\r\n\r\neither way, i'm interested in seeing where you take it
    from here."
