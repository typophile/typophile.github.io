body: There was a pile of bricks sitting in the front yard. I have no idea why they're
  there, but they have been there forever. I have to design a typeface, so I thought
  that using the bricks for that would be pretty neato. So I made all 26 letters (sorry,
  no symbols or anything...yet) and took photos and edited them down to where they
  would be simple enough to use practically. I'm a pretty big fan of block letters,
  so theres that as well. I haven't finished editing all of the letters, but I have
  to get something up here now and figure this will at least get the point across,
  I hope. Please let me know what you think. MORE TO COME!

    letters might make them a bit tough to work with as a font or .eps alphabet.\r\n\r\n\r\nyou
    might consider doing some sort of upright version?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Nice... made me smile. I agree with beejay on the angle you're using... You
    might want to try different ones, to see which will look best when forming words.

  body: Thanks y'all. Beejay - when you say that I should consider doing an "upright
    version," do mean that I should explore using a different perspective entirely,
    or simply rotating each character such that they should be straight up-and-down?

    a traditional horizontal baseline would be helpful, but not necessary, if others
    are going to use these.\r\n\r\nhave you tried rotating the letters as they are
    now?"
