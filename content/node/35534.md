  I'm making a poster for a band called \"Caribou\" and started experimenting with
  some type treatments.  What do you think?  Like it? Hate it?  Is it readable?  \r\n\r\nSomething
  seems not right to me but I can't put my finger on why I'm dissatisfied.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Put of copy of it on the wall and look at it from 10 feet away. Then you'll
    see why it doesn't fly. Too busy and lack of pleasing shape for retention.

  body: It's not very legible. I read the first two letters fine, but then after that
    it's a challenge. Is there a reason why the <em>o</em> overlaps the <em>b</em>
    and the <em>u</em>?

  body: cyanide is right. I think you're trying too hard to make a continuous line.
    try to stick to one baseline and see what happens.

  body: "With something like this, as you connect more lines, just like when blackletter
    joined stems (is it mun, num, mnu, mum, mmu, umn, etc), it can be hard to recognise
    letters are they should be.  \r\n\r\nOn first glance I couldn't immediately process
    the letters, and after thinking about it for a while (without reading your post)
    I figured it was either carikou, or carijoou (I'm sure those mean something in
    some language \u2014wait, nevermind, actually there is a musical artist Len Carikou,
    though according to Google, Yahoo!, and MSN, I'm the first person on the internet
    to type in carijoou, wahoo)\r\n\r\nAnyways, some alternate interpretations would
    be caruoou, carykou, couribou, courikou, etc. If you have to go for the connected
    letters look, make sure it's unambiguous as to which letter it is.  If you have
    to go for the long connected descenders, maybe try a slight break (like you have
    between the top of the <em>c</em> and the bulb of the <em>a</em>) so that we know
    to see two descenders, and not a connected <em>u</em>.  I agree with some of the
    others who've already posted, the <em>o</em> on top of the <em>b</em> and <em>u</em>
    is really distracting, and hampers reading (it makes the <em>b</em> look like
    <em>k</em>).\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos

  body: I agree that's harsh. Graydon, if you don't like it that's fine. But I think
    you may be the one missing the mark (so to speak). This isn't a corporate wordmark
    but a band logo and it has to look cool on a t-shirt, a sticker, a drumset. It
    should be readable, yes, but there's no reason it can't be artistic as well. I'm
    not sure your branding doublespeak applies here, especially since you haven't
    given any constructive criticism at all.

  body: "Theres some good stuff in there. And I think you might be right on the mark,
    depending on the band's sound/image overall.\r\n\r\nPossible ideas:\r\nplaying
    with using a radius on the r more similar to the other letters\r\n\r\nnow that
    te o and u fit the rest of the word, get freaky with them. try bending each end
    of the u. Maybe around the o, maybe into it move the o up to the b's ascender
    area. See if any of that looks good, or spawns other more interesting ideas.\r\n\r\nIgnore
    the haters. The logotype only needs to be art letters at first, and eventually
    become pleasantly readable (after digestion) The first image wasn't pleasant,
    but you are closer now. If someone really needs the letters to be data containers,
    they can flip it and read the band name in Arial on the spine of the box."
