  chocolate syrup or similar fluid? I've been trying to find that kind of font but
  mostly they're not good. Thanks!

    any type of syrup. You'd probably be surprised with the results. \r\n\r\nIn the
    latest issue of HOW (June 2007) they have a great article about doing such a thing.
    Here's a link to their blog about it: <a href=\"http://www.howdesign.com/blog/LowTech+Fun.aspx\">http://www.howdesign.com/blog/LowTech+Fun.aspx</a>"
