  body: "A real challenge. Tiny pic. Seems to be a bird, not a petranodon, but beyond
    that we are guessing. Presumably a raptor, like an eagle, hawk or condor. Closest
    silhouette I spotted was the condor in the badge of the German Condor Legion during
    the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LegionCondor_3670.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LegionCondor2_5915.jpg]\r\nBut
    the match is only approximate.\r\nIs it a font or a letter with a bird on top?
    \r\nDoes anyone else care to venture a guess?\r\nDon"
