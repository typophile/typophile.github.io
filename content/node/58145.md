body: "Dear Typophilers,\r\n\r\nCakeType is proud to announce the launch of our farm-fresh
  website and the release of new typefaces!\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n<strong>NEW
  OPENTYPE LIBRARY</strong> \_\_\r\nWith this launch we stop selling typefaces in
  Postscript Type 1 and TrueType formats as a standard. From now on CakeType typefaces
  will be available exclusively in the OpenType format. By request it is of course
  possible to receive our typefaces in a different format.\r\nMost of the fonts have
  a characterset which covers full CE support and some of them have Greek and Cyrillic
  charactersets.\r\n\r\nCustomers who bought typefaces from the old collection which
  are still in the new collection can upgrade the fonts to OpenType for free. Please
  fill in the online form to contact us.\r\nhttp://www.caketype.com/support/contact\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n<strong>NEW
  TYPEFACES</strong>\r\nAlmost all typefaces in the collection are new or updated.
  We like to highlight a few new designs: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nitti_4059.gif]\r\n\r\nNITTI\r\nNitti
  is an 11-pitch (which means 11 characters equals one inch when set at 11 pt) monospaced
  grotesque typeface, inspired by the irregular grotesques of the 19th and early 20th
  century. The family includes five weights from Light to Black with an extended (Latin)
  character set. OpenType features include slashed zero, alternative shapes for double
  slash and dashes and a pictogram of a pair of scissors. The typeface also contains
  a set of arrows.\r\nhttp://www.caketype.com/type/nitti\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pinup_6181.gif]\r\n\r\nPINUP\r\nPinup
  is a soft, voluptuous and sexy single weight display typeface with an extended (Latin)
  character set and OpenType features which include ligatures, alternative shapes
  for some characters and a pinup. The typeface also contains a set of arrows.\r\nhttp://www.caketype.com/type/pinup\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Panno_5137.gif]\r\n\r\nPANNO
  / PANNO ROUNDED\r\nPanno is the retail version of Hangil E-Type, the signing typeface
  we designed for the English names on the road signs in South Korea. The typeface
  is available in one weight with two versions (positive and negative) with an extended
  (Latin) character set. OpenType features include an alternative shape for the figure
  four and ligatures. The typeface also contains a set of arrows.\r\nPanno / Panno

  BOOKLET</strong>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Enorm_klein_4222.jpg]\r\n\r\n\"Enorm
  klein\" (Enormously small) is a collection of the biggest amongst the smallest and
  the smallest amongst the biggest. The booklet is typeset in Capibara Classic (part
  of the Pixel Package) and richly illustrated and decorated.\r\nhttp://www.caketype.com/books/enorm_klein\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n<strong>DISCOUNT</strong>\r\nTo
  celebrate the launch of our new website and new typefaces, we give a 25% discount
  on any typeface or package from our collection. Books are exclude from discount.

  body: "Congratulations Pieter! Probably the first type website that makes me hungry...\r\n\r\nI'm
    really interested in your involvement in the Hangil E-Type. Do you know what the
    status of that project is? I haven't seen the new typeface in use yet, though
    I haven't been in Korea since last December. Is the hangul sample seen on the
    website the final version? It's different from the previews of Hangil E-Type that
    I'd seen, which had unorthodox, angled forms for \u3131, \u3145, and \u3148 and
    drew mixed reviews. I like the version shown on your website a lot better.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello Brian,\r\n\r\nAs far as I know the new typefaces, Hangil Type and Hangil
    E-Type will be used on new signs from 2010 on. I\u2019m not sure if everything
    will be replaced or only new signs will use the new typefaces. The preview of
    Hangil Type (the Korean typeface) is not the defenitive version, but a sketch.
    If you are in Korea and see a sign in the new typefaces, can you please mail me
    a picture? :)\r\n\r\nPieter"

    see the new signs yet. I don't know when I'll go to back to Korea after that (I'm
    starting work in France soon), but if and when I see the new signs, I'll make
    sure to send you the pictures.\r\n\r\nOh, so Hangil Type refers to the hangul,
    and the Hangil E-Type refers to the Latin, then?"

    English) is for the Latin names and words on the signs.\r\n\r\nPieter"
