body: "Bit of a newbie questions here, but is there a way have fontlab ouput the vertical
  stem widths. I've been measuring manually, and (while fun), it is a very slow process.
  \ Does fontlab generate a report like this? or is there a script that would help?
  Any tips would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: AFDKO's StemHist script can also be run from within FontLab using the macro
    "Report Stem and Alignment Values" which should be in the Outlines macro folder.
    Ctrl+clicking the Run button brings up an options dialog.
