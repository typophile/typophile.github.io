  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Today, on the OpenType developer discussion list, Microsoft made this announcement:

<em>A new white paper has been posted to the Microsoft Typography website. The paper was written by Greg Hitchcock to help font designers understand the Microsoft implementation of the TrueType interpreter.

Here's Greg's official summary:
With the implementation of ClearType® in Windows XP and later versions, adjustments were needed for the interpretation of some TrueType® instructions in order to allow existing fonts to work with no updates. This white paper is targeted for font designers and describes the instruction changes and how fonts can continue to have their instructions behave as described in the current OpenType® specification.

Note that this white paper is not part of the OpenType specification, and will not be submitted for inclusion in the ISO Open Font Format. It is provided solely to explain how Windows handles hinted fonts under ClearType rendering.

The paper can be found here:

		<div class="commentbody">I was very glad to see this paper and I've carefully read it. It is intended to help those who want to make their new or old hinted TT fonts to be compatible with Cleartype. So this is my case. I hoped there will be an answer to my question which I asked in this topic - http://typophile.com/node/14961 and in FontLab's forum about Cleartype hinting. 

I am hinting new Devanagari font using MS VTT application. The question was - how to modify Font program to be able to make deltas for Cleartype only. Horizontal hints are mostly ignored in Cleartype and function 77 (delta instructions) is the only way to correct horizontal position of points. Cleartype is now actually the default rasterizer for LCD monitors and this makes this question very important.

In this paper it is described that this is possible. But how to make this - is clear only for software engineers. I've read the information about rasterizer selectors and return values which can be found in this paper and in TTF specification but didn't understand how to modify function 84 (getinfo) definition to make this possible.

Maybe somebody can say in simple words for a font designer - which text to change in Font Program to be able to make deltas for Cleartype, Black and Greyscale separately and in general. 

In this paper it is also recommended to use 
#PUSH 4,3 
INSTCTRL[]
in prep program in new fonts. This makes ordinary deltas to work in Cleartype as in BW and Greyscale. Maybe this is a choice if the font is designed for Cleartype only. But this is not a solution in my case. 

I hope that somebody will help me and my anusvAra sing will at least look like dot and not like line:)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I hope that this white paper stimulates discussion on this issue as Mihail says, Cleartype is now the default Windows scaler and filterer. One of the thickest bottom lines of this paper, I believe, is that Microsoft considers there is 'extra resolution' in the x axis, regardless of the color of that resolution relative to the user's specification of the color of the type. 

So, in this paper, the only documented option for using Cleartype, the x instructions go into Microsoft's patented Cleartype filtering, where thinking they can round to pink pixels, or red, or dark blue, or occasionally, black pixels, is encouraged and the letters stop listening to me. With such disobedience, there is no way I can see to effectively instruct x features for the seemingly ever-present 10 to 27 pixel per em range of Latin, and get both the right quantity of periodic changes across the reading space, and the right quality in the transitions between those changes across the reading space for a wide range of widths, weights and designs. 

Maybe this isn't a problem in Devanagari, though please let us know how it works out as I'm dying to tally the scripts, designs and even glyphs that can and cannot crawl far enough up in quality in this resolution spectrum, to read text as people do. 

My feeling for Latin, is that the user (hundreds of millions actually), is being constrained to fonts that work with this technology, because some fonts made for older technology did not work. So, instead of simply investing in disabling the few offending instructions in a very very small number of fonts, Microsoft invested in a whole bunch of other things that practically 'disable' all of x from a typographic point of view, for the spectrum I describe. Nothing incoherent, mind you, just disabled. :)

The original ClearType recommendations are still the same as they were on release of the Cleartype Collection in 2004: hint as you normally would, but without post-interpolation deltas, and if you or the users don't like the quality, compel them to find the appearance menu and change all of their OS rendering to "Standard" so our fonts will look better. Is that still right?

Cheers!

		<div class="commentbody">David,
I think the [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/truetypecleartype.aspx#Toc227035739|conclusion]] of the whitepaper made it clear that the recommended solution is <em>not</em> to “…hint as you normally would, but without post-interpolation deltas….” The conclusion recommends that the font place the sequence
<code>
#PUSH 4,3
INSTCTRL[]
</code>
At the beginning of the CVT program. When this is done, there are no restrictions on any of the TrueType instructions. That said, the resolution is different when operating with ClearType turned on—but that is similar to other technologies that TrueType has dealt with in the past, such as non-square pixels on screens and printers. The GETINFO instruction can be used to determine if ClearType is being used.

		<div class="commentbody">The need of Cleartype only deltas is caused by the natural desire to control (just a little bit) x direction and there are no other means to do this then deltas and moves (horizontal cvt and cvt deltas do not work). If we simply switch on ordinary deltas (#PUSH 4,3 INSTCTRL[]) for Cleartype this not only does not resolve these problems but creates some new difficulties because these deltas have effect on other rasterizers also which do not ignore x instructions. This is a choice only in that case if one do not care about other rasterizers (if font is designed for Cleartype only). It is not convenient at all to correct x problems in Cleartype by general deltas and then again correct these effects by Black and Grey deltas.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just one example - my greatest problem is a dot (anusvAra, nukta etc. signs). It has (and must have) a shape of rhomb. It is almost twice larger then vertical and horizontal stems. In large sizes this difference is not so clear because of the shape. But in small sizes it naturally takes 2 pixels when stems are 1 pixel. And it is square form and I have to correct this and reduce it's size in small sizes until it will take the shape of rhomb. In Cleartype this correction works only in y direction - so I have the shape of line or triangle. If I reduce the size of dot to the size of the stem - the problem will accure in large sizes and in print. If to use ordinary deltas for correction this in turn will effect the shape in BW and Grey renderings so I have to correct this in turn by BW-only and Grey-only deltas. There will be too many deltas just for one dot (and I have many others). I tried other ways and have some more or less acceptable result but this shape in Cleartype definitely looks bad in many sizes.</div>

I greatly appreciate you trying to communicate through the language, font and technical barriers and if you were here, I'd give your font a big hug. 

>#PUSH 4,3

GH>When this is done, there are no restrictions on any of the TrueType instructions. 

Which is to say they can be interpreted, but wrongly. When I say mirp and round a stem bound to the grid, if your interpreter don't, that's restriction.

>That said, the resolution is different when operating with ClearType turned on

And to me, working on low res. text, there is no difference between interpreter disobedience in rounding, and no x hints whatsoever. 

ClearType scaling and rendering does not work nearly as smoothly, for the resolution spectrum we are trying to deploy readable fonts in, as well as Quartz does. 

John has convinced me though, that the difference between completely incoherent and annoying saccade hiccups is currently slightly smaller than the problems we face immediately. ;)

David, that is incorrect. It does round the stem <em>to the grid.</em> The [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/truetypecleartype.aspx#Toc227035719|grid]] is exactly as I describe in the paper, a sixteenth of a pixel in the ClearType-direction (usually the x-axis.) This leaves you with a quarter of a grid fractional hinting left. It would make no sense to have less precision with the rounding because then you would not be able to fine tune anything. 

Given the power of the TrueType interpreter, if you are unhappy with this level of precision, you can develop functions to implement different rounding methods.

<strong>svayambhu></strong> If you wish to make deltas that are specific for ClearType, you need to conditionally apply those deltas using information from the [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/truetypecleartype.aspx#Toc227035732|GETINFO instruction]].

Greg that is incorrect, or at the very least, misleading to the audience for which you claim the paper was published. 
The grid I am talking about, and 'we designers' are concerned with, is the output grid, not what the scaler dreams. 
We have 64ths of a pixel to round to in TT, <em>without</em> ClearType, you know... (I invented it). 

>It would make no sense to have less precision with the rounding because then you would not be able to fine tune anything.

It makes less no sense to have more or less precision with the rounding than the actual output grid, but please... show me your "fine tuned" ClearType.

		<div class="commentbody">David, for clarity, is the horizontal ‘output grid’ on an RGB LCD screen a pixel or a third of a pixel?

We have a divergence of the scalar grid from the output grid (I'm using these terms for ease of reference to the preceding discussion; perhaps other terms are more technically accurate?), so it seems pointless to insist that one or other application of the single phrase ‘the grid’ is correct. Better to say that the notion of ‘the grid’ as a singular phenomenon no longer pertains. From the rendering side, I can see how ‘the grid’ might always have been understood to be the scalar grid, which coincidentally was for a long time identical to the output grid. From the font making side, I can see how ‘the grid’ might always have been understood to be the output grid, which was happily for a long time identical to the scalar grid.

Realistically, Greg, how is a type designer/hinter supposed to target a 3-subpixel output grid via a 16-unit scalar grid, especially since the sampling of that scalar grid is non-uniformly applied to the different subpixel colours, and with subpixel positioning the outlines may fall relative to different subpixel boundaries? If using compatible, whole-pixel positioning, I can see how delta hints could be applied something like impressionist painting, adjusting until one gets the shape proportions and stroke density one wants -- with the caveat that due to gamma and CT tuning this may not be what other users see --, but once one shifts to subpixel positioning, all bets seem to be off.

The most obvious solution to the proportional problem affecting Mihail's anusvara and nukta is y-direction greyscaling. I know this because similar dot shapes occur in some projects on which I am working, and I am testing rendering in WPF. The hybrid CT/greyscale antialiasing in WPF should have been default in Vista CT. Will it be in Office 7?

		<div class="commentbody">> I can see how ‘the grid’ might always have been understood to be the output grid, which was happily for a long time identical to the scalar grid.

Uh Oh, looks we have a newly constrained definition. . . John, lol, sub pixels have been around for a very very long time. Did Matthew design Verdana to the 11 ppm  grid, or 33, or was it 176 ppm... let me think.

(Verdana in Vista for Ikea)

Do you'all actually think any type designer considers this to be fit to a grid for readability? Nice I, nice, l, nice i, nice o, nice a. See, I can say nice things about CT. Problem is that we crave 26 "nice" per size, per Latin English l.c, per user, or saccade hiccups. The instructing font designer can only, regardless of whatever you might think to define as the grid, address the hints to the output grid(s). 

But let's mosey around this white paper. 

Microsoft claims here that because some fonts hinted for aliased rendering include exploding points as a result of diagonal instructions gone wild, the (published) cntrlinst option in ClearType needed to address an imaginary output-independent grid gone wild and ignore the x and d instructions. Simon of Microsoft showed one ancient picture of such a font, but never listed how many, or who's it was, or anything else about that font.

One thing is certain about that font — if it was hinted so strictly for aliased rendering, it should also have been hinted strictly for the glyph widths. And as it likel was strictly hinted for widths, its compatible horizontal metrics can only be reached today with Windows anti-aliasing if that font is scaled by TT's undocumented cntrlinst set to "compatible". No?

There are two diverging points to be made from this. One, is that if Microsoft needed to keep lots of documents compatible, and it needed an option to use widths either from the TT hdmx table in the font, or from the rounding results of something else rendering to the legacy metrics, i.e. other than the metrics CT would yield naturally... don't others too? Don't a lot of people outside of Microsoft need non-MS fonts to be rendered this way? Why is this not documented?

And the other point is, if these exploding points were in legacy fonts on legacy metrics that should only be scaled by the "Compatible" option, why destroy the 1:1 relationship between the truetype instruction and the output grid in the "Natural" option? Shouldn't all and any fonts that even bother a wit for SDPVTL, (the incredibly obscure exploding instruction), be treated to "Compatible" scaling in CT, and the other mode just listen to all the instructions?

P & Vinegar under the bridge. So now: where is the "Actual" option that trusts we know what we're doing with both pixels and sub-pixels all by our typographic selves? Why are we constrained to poorer quality than possible in the resolutions we need to go to the web with? Why is the public constrained to quality that ignores the output grid? Why are we, type designers, not permitted to create a standard of quality for our customers that Microsoft and Apple can envy and emulate? 

I've done everything I could to help: pushing customers into "standard" Vista scaling and rendering, pulling others to FreeType, making all the suggestions I could to MS and Apple, and showing hundreds of example fonts. One can redefine the grid to anything one's heart desires, but the circle keeps on closing. The smaller that circle gets, the higher the pressure, the further up this is going to spout, (and the more obvious the 500 lb. boa constrainer in the corner).

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, David, so the output grid is ppm, i.e. whole pixels per em. Works great for aliased rendering and, as I wrote above, in the case of aliased type the output grid is identical to the scalar grid and everyone is happy (except designers who want fonts to look like typefaces and not like toddlers' building blocks). But subpixel rendering, by its nature, addresses something other than whole pixels, which means that the scalar grid isn't identical to the output grid. Throw in non-linear supersampling for subpixel colour filtering, and the scalar grid has moved so far away from the output grid that there seems to me an unbridgeable gap between them. This is the bit where I think we are agreeing, in case you missed it. The TT hinting model, no matter how we think about it in terms of output grid, is implemented via the scalar grid and ’twas ever so. As soon as the scalar grid diverges from the output grid, hinting instructions no longer apply to the output grid. This makes a whole pile of hints either ineffective or unpredictable in their result. This is the other bit where I think we are agreeing, in case you missed it.

One response to this is to say that the scalar grid should never diverge from the output grid. But I can hear that horse heading toward the horizon and the barn door is falling off its hinges.

Another response to this is to say that since a whole pile of hints no longer do what they used to do, let's ignore all hints completely and just antialias the shit out of everything. Apple call this Quartz, as if the fuzzy-bear type had anything in common with the sharpness and clarity of crystals.

Microsoft's response has been that some hints are worth preserving -- since they help retain stroke density; something that Mac rendering fails at consistently --, and Greg's white paper suggests we can have our cake and eat it: that we can turn back on the hints that are disabled for legacy fonts. But it seems to me that even if you turn those hints back on, they a) won't do what they used to do and b) trying to get them to do anything specific will be next to impossible, especially once subpixel positioning is thrown into the mix.

Greg, has anyone to your knowledge actually made any fonts that use x-direction deltas in CT?</div>

The TT instruction set is perfectly capable of scaling letters to pixels, or pixels smaller than building blocks in anti-aliased environments. 

>But sub-pixel rendering, by its nature, addresses something other than whole pixels, which means that the scalar grid isn’t identical to the output grid.

Not precisely. It means that sub-pixel rendering is finer than the hinting's grid, and the user's color specification, But assuming there is total instructional control over location of features, sub-pixels can be carefully or wontonly used to represent features better around correct counters and spaces, or make garbage.

There is nothing generally useful in between Apple's approach and letting us loose with our skills. But it doesn't look good for Windows web users or web developers, universally and for the long term.  A lot of people have become interested in why.

		<div class="commentbody"><em>But assuming there is total instructional control over location of features, sub-pixels can be carefully or wontonly used to represent features better around correct counters and spaces, or make garbage.</em>

Here's the problem as I see it:

ClearType's crown jewels are the colour filtering, and that relies in part on non-linear supersampling. The colour filtering enables Microsoft to retain stroke density, and also to provide users with the ability to tune ClearType rendering. But in order to do the colour filtering they need to supersample in the x-direction so that they can differentially address the R G and B subpixels. Supersampling to a 16 unit scalar grid enables them to assign more units to the G subpixel than to the R, and least to the B --8, 5 and 3, respectively --, and this reflects average human colour sensitivity: presumably for evolutionary reasons, we are sensitive to more shades of green than to other colours. So the colour filtering is important, and the differential addressing of subpixels -- and hence non-linear supersampling -- is important.

So in order for a font maker to have ‘total instructional control over location of features’, that non-linear scalar grid needs to be broken down into sections that relate to actual subpixels, since the location of features is ultimately rendered in a subpixel output grid. So that's a practical difficulty for a hinter. It isn't insurmountable, but it increases the hinting brain hurt, because the distance an x-direction feature needs to be moved across the non-linear scalar grid depends on what part of the grid it is in: if it is in the G section, it needs to move further than if it is in the R or B section. Then, presuming that the hinter has wrapped his head around this, subpixel positioning is thrown into the mix, which means that you can't anticipate in which section of the scalar grid an outline will fall, because the output grid now consists of subpixels <em>from different pixels.</em>

This is why I am intrigued to know whether anyone, even within MS, has actually made a font that attempts to apply total instructional control in the ClearType x-direction. Greg's white paper explains what needs to be done inside a font to enable the full set of hinting controls, but it doesn't demonstrate that having those controls turned on actually helps anyone.</div>

WADR, nonsense. Their downstroke density is no better than random. The only reason for any consistency in Cleartype's x direction is from consistency in the contours.

>and also to provide users with the ability to tune ClearType rendering. 

I think that little app is a placebo. Does it still employ italic to show the user what text will 'look like"?

>in order to do the colour filtering they need to to supersample...

WADR. nonsense. The hints adjust the outline to the output grid and the rendering can turn on the pixels depending on how much of the pixel is contained in the outline vs not. Supersample in the rendering, sure, but in the grid fitting, bull. 

> presuming that the hinter has wrapped his head around this, subpixel positioning is thrown into the mix

Wrap? Not a problem. Hint left stem border hard, move right stem border relatively. The contour takes care of the color and you go on to the white space. You have not done this have you?

>This is why I am intrigued to know whether anyone, even within MS, has actually made a font that attempts to apply total instructional control in the ClearType x-direction

You are kidding me, right. You QA'd and managed the only CT font project of all time, five years ago (?) They never looked, and you never looked, ( I know, I asked. MS said "it's too hard").

>but it doesn’t demonstrate that having those controls turned on actually helps anyone.

And it never will. The real problem we face is that the commonwealth of reading is much bigger and stronger than any government or company. Looks like the only way "up" is a shameful paper I would really rather not write. But as you can clearly see by the intense confusion in the commonwealth of reading, I must. 

Before that is published though, I want to say here that up until 2004, I was a universally peaceful and caring member of this industry with good relations all around and no reason to criticize anyone's typographic beliefs, typographic work or typographic origins. Anyone who's known me before and after 2004, knows this to be true. :)

Ordinary TTF hinting effects both screen and print. But CT works only on screen, there are no subpixels in print. So the situation is different and it isn't reasonable to solve CT problems with ordinary means. But exactly this is proposed in MS white paper. Or maybe I mistake and INSTCTRL 4,3 have other not so obvious effects except ordinary deltas in CT mode (but cvt deltas don't work - so one cannot speak about full instruction set).

Greg >If you wish to make deltas that are specific for ClearType, you need to conditionally apply those deltas using information from the GETINFO instruction.

It is clear. But how? Can you help me and write the code of function 84 definition that will make this possible?. Or if it is some kind of MS professional secret, why to advise others to use it? Or where it is possible to find more information about this to try to solve this problem myself? I understand the logic of the function GETINFO definition but I have not enough information to modify it correctly.

		<div class="commentbody">David, the fact that you think the reasons MS consider supersampling are ‘bull’ doesn't alter my analysis of the problem that supersampling introduces. If I agreed with you 100%, that wouldn't alter the analysis of the problem either. This is how CT works. If your argument is simply that CT shouldn't exist, or shouldn't work the way it does, then debating whether and how x-direction hints are re-enabled isn't the conversation we need to be having.

<em>You QA’d and managed the only CT font project of all time, five years ago (?) They never looked, and you never looked, ( I know, I asked. MS said “it’s too hard”).</em>

Right. That was five years ago, and lack of x-direction deltas was a given for that project. There was no talk at that stage, at least not shared with the CT collection designers, of mechanisms to re-enable those instructions. So this is why I am asking Greg now, now that such mechanisms are being presented, whether in the intervening time anyone has tried to make a font in this way.</div>

No one has come forth. I reckon it would cost between 5 and 15 K dollars to prepare <em>a style</em> for web use, as opposed to 750 to 1000 to do <em>a family</em> if x-hints were not tossed into fairlyland resolution.

		<div class="commentbody">DB> <em>The grid I am talking about, and ’we designers’ are concerned with, is the output grid, not what the scaler dreams.</em>

There are many possible “output grids.” Some are hardware related, some are perceptual related, and I suppose that some could be scaler dreams. The grid we chose, I believe, gives us reasonably fine level perceptual control of the image. 
I highly recommend reading a paper by Jim Blinn: <i>[[http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Paper/1594436.aspx | What Is a Pixel?]]</i> This gives a great overview on the basics of computer graphics and the multiple definitions of a pixel.

DB> <em>It makes less no sense to have more or less precision with the rounding than the actual output grid, but please... show me your “fine tuned” ClearType.</em>

Again this depends on your definition of output grid, but I will make the assertion that by rounding to our grid you change both the physical and visual manifestation of the data. If you were to round up or down to the next grid location, it would be visibly detectable. (Granted it might take excellent visual acuity, but that can be the case in high-resolution bi-level rendering as well.)

JH> <em>Better to say that the notion of ‘the grid’ as a singular phenomenon no longer pertains. From the rendering side, I can see how ‘the grid’ might always have been understood to be the scalar grid, which coincidentally was for a long time identical to the output grid.</em>

It is not clear to me that the notion of ‘the grid’ as a singular phenomenon was ever a stable definition. The definition of a pixel is hard enough.

JH> <em>Realistically, Greg, how is a type designer/hinter supposed to target a 3-subpixel output grid via a 16-unit scalar grid, especially since the sampling of that scalar grid is non-uniformly applied to the different subpixel colours, and with subpixel positioning the outlines may fall relative to different subpixel boundaries?</em>

The first generation of ClearType used the non-uniform subpixel color implementation. The current implementation is uniform with two virtual subpixels in the ClearType direction for each real subpixel.

I did not elaborate on this topic in the whitepaper because it was not directly related to the topic of instruction-set compatibility. At the scaler level we apply the sixteen-unit scalar grid. During the scan-conversion process we sample at six units per pixel in the ClearType direction. At first we wondered if this sampling dichotomy would be problematic, but we’ve found no indications of problems related to that decision.

JH>  <em>If using compatible, whole-pixel positioning, I can see how delta hints could be applied something like impressionist painting, adjusting until one gets the shape proportions and stroke density one wants — with the caveat that due to gamma and CT tuning this may not be what other users see —, but once one shifts to subpixel positioning, all bets seem to be off.</em>

You are correct, fine tuning the shape works fine in the modes we call “natural width” or “compatible width” ClearType, but with sub-pixel positioning, it is a much greater challenge for fine tuning. This is one of the reasons we provide [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/truetypecleartype.aspx#Toc227035732|GETINFO]] with information to help the hinter make the best conditional implementation necessary.

JH> <em>The hybrid CT/greyscale antialiasing in WPF should have been default in Vista CT. Will it be in Office 7?</em>

Windows Vista contains several different graphics rendering platforms—GDI, GDI+, and WPF.  Symmetrically smoothed ClearType is only available on the WPF platform. Vista has no concept of a default rendering platform, it is up to each application to choose the rendering platform. I won’t speculate on what platform(s) the next version of Office (Office 2010) will use.

DB> <em>Microsoft claims here that because some fonts hinted for aliased rendering include exploding points as a result of diagonal instructions gone wild, the (published) cntrlinst option in ClearType needed to address an imaginary output-independent grid gone wild and ignore the x and d instructions.</em>

In the section of the whitepaper on [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/truetypecleartype.aspx#Toc227035718|ClearType Interaction with TrueType Instructions]] I discuss “exploding points” which are typically caused by the PV and FV becoming perpendicular. This is not a ClearType problem per se, as it can happen with any type of hints, but the problem becomes more exasperated when extreme aspect ratios are used. This is why we use super-sampling instead of over-sampling in the ClearType instructions. This issue, though, has nothing to do with the “cntrlinst” [INSTCTRL] issue—it is merely background information.

DB> <em>And as it likel was strictly hinted for widths, its compatible horizontal metrics can only be reached today with Windows anti-aliasing if that font is scaled by TT’s undocumented cntrlinst set to “compatible”.</em>
 
It’s not clear to me what you are talking about here. If you are referencing the [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/truetypecleartype.aspx#Toc227035734|compatible widths mode]] that I briefly mention in the paper, that is not changeable by the font program, that is set by the application. A different rendering method is used in the compatible width case.

DB> <em>…if these exploding points were in legacy fonts on legacy metrics that should only be scaled by the “Compatible” option, why destroy the 1:1 relationship between the truetype instruction and the output grid in the “Natural” option?</em>

If I understand you correctly, I don’t believe that the “Natural” option you describe would have a 1:1 relationship with the TrueType instruction. The “natural option” (natural widths) would still not use the same “output grid” as bi-level rendering. 

DB> <em>Shouldn’t all and any fonts that even bother a wit for SDPVTL, (the incredibly obscure exploding instruction), be treated to “Compatible” scaling in CT, and the other mode just listen to all the instructions?</em>

SDPVTL is not they only instruction that can cause “exploding” points. Any setting of the PV perpendicular to the FV can cause this situation.

JH> <em>Greg, has anyone to your knowledge actually made any fonts that use x-direction deltas in CT?</em>

We have spent a lot of time exploring this area, and we actually make significant use of these instructions to fine tune the appearance of ClearType.

JH>> <em>But sub-pixel rendering, by its nature, addresses something other than whole pixels, which means that the scalar grid isn’t identical to the output grid.</em>
DB> <em>Not precisely. It means that sub-pixel rendering is finer than the hinting’s grid, and the user’s color specification, But assuming there is total instructional control over location of features, sub-pixels can be carefully or wontonly used to represent features better around correct counters and spaces, or make garbage.</em>

I believe that the way I’ve described the ClearType system full allows for “total instructional control over location of features.”

JH> <em>Supersampling to a 16 unit scalar grid enables them to assign more units to the G subpixel than to the R, and least to the B —8, 5 and 3, respectively —, and this reflects average human colour sensitivity: presumably for evolutionary reasons, we are sensitive to more shades of green than to other colours. So the colour filtering is important, and the differential addressing of subpixels — and hence non-linear supersampling — is important.</em>

I want to make sure that my earlier comment is made clear. The scaling and hinting engines use a 16 unit scalar grid. The scan conversion engine uses a 6 unit grid—two for each subpixel.

DB> <em>I want to say here that up until 2004, I was a universally peaceful and caring member of this industry with good relations all around and no reason to criticize anyone’s typographic beliefs, typographic work or typographic origins. Anyone who’s known me before and after 2004, knows this to be true. :)</em>

I’ll concur :-)

I understand the logic of the function GETINFO definition but I have not enough information to modify it correctly.</em>

Function 84 is specific to Visual TrueType and how it implements resolution dependent hinting. My replies are more generically targeted for how to implement resolution dependent hinting in the TrueType instruction set.

I describe the [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/truetypecleartype.aspx#Toc227035733|GETINFO ClearType Flag]] in the paper. The important parts are setting the selector and checking the return value. The selector for the ClearType flag is bit 6 and the return is in bit 13. Example code could look like this:

<code>
#PUSH, 64  /* Bit number 6 is set */
GETINFO[]
#PUSH, 8192  /* Bit number 13 is set */
IF[]
….
Do ClearType specific hints
…
EIF[] /* You could add an ELSE[] for non-ClearType instructions */
</code>

Now, since ClearType is not available on all releases of the TrueType rasterizer, it is best to also add conditional code that verifies you are using a version of TrueType that supports ClearType. Rasterizer versions 36 and greater (but not larger than 64) is OK. Usually this extra overhead is best handled as a function.

Okay, let me rephrase my original statement:

No graphics rendering platform in Windows Vista should have shipped without symetrically smoothed ClearType, and no graphics rendering platform in Windows 7 should.

Seriously, without the y-direction antialiasing, CT is severely hampered and is getting a bad name for itself, a worse name than I think it deserves.

Is there something that actually prevents the GDI engines from being updated to support the y-direction antialiasing?</div>

Greg, thanks for illustration code. Can it be used in glyph program or only in font program as function definition? 
I'm trying to modify in VTT in this way function 84 definition, but I don't know how to change values #PUSH,2,0  and #PUSH,2,1 which work for Greyscale. When I'm trying to use it in glyph program and "add CT specific hints" (CALL[], 18, -64, 13, 2, 77 for example) I have error message - "end of line expected". I understand that the reason is only my ignorance in TTF hinting language. So the last my hope was INSTCTRL 4,3 - to use ordinary deltas for CT and change all previously done deltas to black-only deltas. But I was surprised again - after adding INSTCTRL 4,3 Black-only deltas begin to work in CT also. So, it is sad to recognize, but such an ordinary visual hinter as I cannot do anything to correct any problems of CT rasterization.

When I see CT anti-aliased appearance of my font in VTT - for me it looks good with hints or without hints. It would be nice to have at least an option of this rasterization in Windows CT tuner.</div>

GregH> The grid we chose, I believe, gives us reasonably fine level perceptual control of the image.

I'm sure it does, when imaging. But, "imaging" theories and theorists are making a fundamental error — assuming that there is only the imaging pixel down to the base of the resolution spectrum. Cleartype's one documented option of scaling is a perfectly clear example of this, where the imaging pixel takes over the grid from the typographic pixel and the typographic theories on scaling and rendering. That is not working reasonably fine for everyone, has not from the beginning, and now more fonts are needed, in abundance. 

Geeze... Just because imaging works most of the time, does not mean it works all of the time. And where it doesn't work, is down here where <em>all</em> the pixels matter. Then, a harmony of grids' needs to be established where the imaging grid is taking orders from the typographic grid, not the other way around. Proof of this need (in Microsoft's own practice), is found in diversity: the y axis of ClearType seems to work fine in typographic pixels, not imaging pixels, and the writer of the "What's a Pixel?" most likely wrote that paper on an OS which had a perfectly good grasp of typographic pixels in both dimensions, (assuming, like most older engineering-backgrounded users, he wrote his white paper on XP with smoothing turned off in a monospaced font?).

We would like an unconstrained option to address your users with what you might consider extra-reasonable levels of perceptual control of the type, but they do not.

Cheers!

I.E. this is not one of the hints we use to make "fonts" that work at small sizes in anti-aliased environs.

It's not going to help a font through the current assault and battery of screwy sizing, scary scaling and red-faced rendering we, (or some of us) now face. It's like being up to you neck in gators, and someone tickles your foot and says, "Does that help?" (It does: they have not eaten my foot yet). 

One correction that may help the reader here, is "the left edge of the contour was shifted to the right by four pixel units", should read, I believe, "the left edge of the contour was shifted to the right by 4/64ths of a pixel. 

And then, there is the interesting question of why any baby yellow or baby blue is showing up at all as those pixels are entirely not within by the contour being rendered.

		<div class="commentbody">Here is a sample image that addresses one of David’s points and one of John’s requests.

The image is similar to the above image (although not shown from VTT.) Instead of using SHPIX, I used the MIRP to shift the left edges. (I also made a version that does the same with the MSIRP instruction.) I’m moving the edge relative to the left side bearing point. The images with MIRP, MSIRP and SHPIX are exactly the same in VTT. 

I made an additional change in the hints by setting the advance width to be 3 1/6 pixels wide. This forces a shift when displaying in sub-pixel positioned ClearType mode. In the above image you can see the pattern repeats every six glyphs.

David> <em>One correction that may help the reader here, is “the left edge of the contour was shifted to the right by four pixel units”, should read, I believe, “the left edge of the contour was shifted to the right by 4/64ths of a pixel.”</em>

I agree that is better wording.

David> <em>And then, there is the interesting question of why any baby yellow or baby blue is showing up at all as those pixels are entirely not within by the contour being rendered.</em>

This has to do with filtering, and is described in detail in our [[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/cleartype/default.aspx|papers on ClearType.]]   The primary purpose of the ClearType filter is to remove the perception of color. This, in theory, is potentially a tunable parameter. But the font hinter cannot rely on what tuning parameter the user has chosen. Additional factors like the foreground and background colors, gamma correct, and of course the display system architecture are going to impact what is emitted by each display sub-pixel. So, big picture, when adjusting the edges, you need to proof the result closely, and verify the visual results (which I know you already do.)

		<div class="commentbody">David, 

I think my implicit point was: I have no clue :) When I worked on Windows 98, I always hated the 1-pixel stems of Verdana and I changed the gasp table to make it switch to 2 pixels at smaller ppems. When Windows 2000 came along, I hated the default antialiasing that used 21 shades of gray even more, because straight stems were black and round elements were almost white. When Windows XP came along, I hated ClearType because every morning I felt I had a hangover because my vision was blurry and I was seeing color fringes. I complained to Greg and Kevin, and they told me that my visual acuity or color sensitivity must be poor or something (one of them, I don't remember), so when I visited Redmond some time in 2005, they tested me (with funny little color stones that I had to order in gradients), and I scored the second-best result of all tests they've done. Which apparently meant that what was supposed to be poor was actually very good. 

When Acrobat LCD rendering was introduced, I hated it. 

When I switched to Mac OS X, I loved the text rendering, and still do. The no-hint-fuzzy approached works for me by far the best. I feel that reading on a Mac screen is like reading letterpress books printed in the 1960s. Windows is like offset on glossy paper. 

And I still don't have a clue why. Completely regardless of INSTCTRL and MIRP. Do you know why?

I'll guess: 9% color sensitivity, 12% the experience of a black font specification converted to black and grays, 68% that you are not a child or distant viewer in need of fonts 30% larger than print, 10% being interested in a high quality web experience, and I'll leave the other 1% to Greg.;) 

Adam>The no-hint-fuzzy approached works for me by far the best
Assuming you are talking about text sizes, it's "no hints" when anti or "all hints" when aliased in the Mac approach, according to the user's specification in appearances.

This may not be the bottom line, but the combined decisions of Apple and MS, have put world wide web text font development in a difficult position with few good clear options. 

Your decision, Adam, to switch is perhaps the simplest. Now that you have, you can more easily appreciate how much better both "traditional zooming" (iPhone), and  "web zooming" (Safari) environments have to offer without all the fuss. 

Cheers!

more fonts look "good" on Mac than on Windows, in my experience. The difference between very well hinted fonts and poorly hinted fonts on Windows is paramount: the poorly hinted fonts really look bad. On Mac, the very well hinted fonts may to some look not as good than on Windows (though not for me), but the poorly hinted fonts look on the Mac much better than on Windows. A TrueType font with no hinting at all will look fine on a Mac and catastrophically on Windows.

		<div class="commentbody">David, 

I actually like large screen fonts. Back on Windows, I used Opera because at that time, it was the only browser that offered real zoom (not just enlarging the type while keeping the column width, which is ridiculous). Thank God other browser makers realized it, though I still don't understand why Safari and Firefox don't have a normal zoom slider or dropdown list in the status bar (which is a standard UI element in Word, PowerPoint, QuarkXPress, InDesign etc.). My typical reading size for the web on a 24" screen is this: 
[[http://www.twardoch.com/tmp/typophile_webbodytype.png]]
(This is in fact exactly the way I'm reading Typophile. For some reason Typophile won't let me insert an image here.)

Even back on Windows, I went through a lot of trouble to fine-tune my screen appearance. When I had a 15" 133 dpi notebook as early as in 2001, I suffered from the inability to effectively set the Windows screen DPI to 133. (The "standard" setting is 96 and the "large fonts" mode is 120). In both 120 and 133, many dialog boxes of poorly written applications are reformatted, some UI controls such as "OK" and "Cancel" are invisible (pushed out of the boundaries of the dialog box). So effectively, that setting was unworkable but I came up with another trick: I took a condensed font (first Nina, then ITC Officina in the TrueType version hinted by ParaType) and reduced its UPM size so that at standard point sizes it would appear larger. And I set it as my standard UI font. That worked a bit better. 

In fact, I've been using this trick for some time: I would take Nina (which is kind of a condensed Verdana) and set its UPM to a smaller number so that at the same ppem size, the *widths* of my modified Nina and the normal Verdana would roughly match. I would get the same number of characters per line with my customized Nina as I would with the regular Verdana, but the effective body size would be larger in the Y direction. So, while using a font that was "condensed in the X direction", de facto I was using a font that was "extended in the Y direction". Which proved to be very effective. 

I remember that the day on which I realized the simple fact, that by reducing the UPM size you can enlarge the body of any font at a given ppem size, I was a happy person :)

Best,
Adam

What Adam said. And, on iphones I have not seen the Cleartype collection, but I have remade a couple of them, along with Lucida Grande and a raft of experimental FB fonts, (for my own experimental evaluation, and for no other purpose), with name tables to intercept verdana a georgia web font calls on the Mac, in Safari, and no, the CT collection does not look nearly as good as Vergeorgia.

Adam, you work a lot harder than Greg says windows users will, just to get their type right for reading. As far as I've been informed, they generally don't want to change even size. This is what a web font developer must plan on, vs. tinkering with the upm of a condensed font and chancing users and web developers to use it at 2x the user's normal size preference. But I like it if you're happy, as ever because what you're doing reminds me of an old double-play combination from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball%27s_Sad_Lexicon">last century</a>. ;)

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">The nice thing about CSS webfonts is that you (as a font developer, at least) can tweak them at ends where CSS can only work deal with difficulties. For example, there is the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#relative-sizing-the-font-size-adjust-pro|CSS font-size-adjust]] property which tries to deal with the different face sizes relative to the body size (i.e. at nominally same point/ppem sizes). But with webfonts, the font developer can adjust this easily in the font -- and that even in a very undestructive way, by just changing the UPM size. You can even serve two different fonts depending on the platform of the client (Mac OS X or Windows, for example). The Mac font can be completely unhinted (i.e. smaller in file size) and can have a UPM adjusted so that the same web page will render visually similarly in both Mac OS X and Windows. 

I believe that the issue of body sizes will become quite interesting with webfonts. The old principles of type design for print were: make the caps height the same across various typefaces. But this may be a principle worth revisiting. In a way, in print, the vertical size was more of a set limit, since the page had a fixed height. But on the web, the horizontal direction is more of a fixed value, or at least oscilates around fixed constraints (because there is an average line length which is useful for reading), but the vertical space is much more flexible. The user can scroll endlessly. So much more freedom lies in the glyph height and in the linespacing. Choosing good defaults is crucial here. 

For example, the one thing that I actually don't like about the ClearType project is that the body size of the typefaces has been set so small. Especially when switching from Verdana and Georgia (which were very opulent, design with "caption size" optical proportions) to Calibri or Constantia, everything suddenly looks much too small. 

The "this is too small" perception is actually something that sometimes gets through from users to font developers. Up until Mac OS X 10.3, the AAT version of Zapfino that shipped with the system was set on a 1000 UPM with the normal caps and the lowercase  being quite tiny -- to "make space" for the extreme ascenders and descenders of the swashy forms. But apparently, many users complained that Zapfino was "too small for its point size", so with Mac OS X 10.4, Apple made a radical cut and... changed the UPM of the font from 1000 to 400. I.e. effectively enlarged the face size of the font by 250% relatively to the body size! 

To make it clear: there are two methods of enlarging the face size at a given point size:  you can either enlarge the face size (i.e. scale up all the glyphs) or you can reduce the body size (i.e. set the UPM lower). This will have exactly the same effect, but actually the latter method is often more efficient because you don't have to deal with rounding errors, changing kerning values or lost hinting. This is kind of like when you're trying to have a party or concert that feels like a "full house". You either invite more guests, or you rent a smaller room. 

So, apart from hinting issues: type designers, choose your body size (and the built-in linespacing values) wisely for screen purposes, because in some environments it's not so trivial for the end-user to "fix" it.

Georgia and Verdana were made in ways that pretty much preclude extending their character sets to supporting more diacritic-heavy languages like Vietnamese, at least if one wanted to retain backwards compatible metrics. Even though the initial release of the ClearType fonts had similarly basic character support, we were aware that these fonts were almost certainly going to be extended in future, and so we needed to ensure that there was reasonable vertical space to work with in the body height and default linespacing. Even so, we ran into difficulties during the Win7 Cambria extension work, and I'd argue that seriously multilingual fonts probably should be even smaller on the body (at least if notions of body size are to remain a basis for type scaling and linespacing; only a couple of days ago I was suggesting to some folk at MS that what we really need are language-specific vertical metrics settings).</div>

Adam, I have no idea what tinkering with the upm does for anything at all in user-space. School me with examples if you so desire. All I know is that optical sizing had a place in the print world and as Kevlar said in Mexico City, he's concluded from studies that if typographers used to do something, there is a pretty good chance there was a good reason for it. 

>(and the built-in linespacing values)  

all gone. what was it for, Adam?

lol, go for it!  I'll be on the other side of the fulcrum.

The  issues here is what users are used to, and the w3c's impossible philosophy towards, and definitions of, the most important parameter of type to any user.

Of course you are! Having such a table for both inter and intra-font size issues is RIDICULOUS, what was I thinking.

I think since he nature of the support of these two kinds of relationship in the software is quote different, I'd say this should go into two tables. I do agree that a SIZE table along the lines of what you talked about would be useful. </div>

Yes, although it still means putting family-level data within each individual font, which strikes me as less than ideal. What happens if the data is contradictory, which is always a risk when redundancy is involved.

Data about what fonts to use in what situation -- whether it is size, rendering engine, etc. -- seems to me to belong at a wrapper level, independent of the individual fonts. The XML composite font format standard seems to me an ideal place in which to include such data, with different size variants of a single typeface forming a composite font and the individual component fonts being selected according to situation.

We have a good opportunity to push this in the standard, and I reckon there is more chance of having something like size implemented as part of a new layout mechanism than trying to encourage developers to extend their existing font support to new tables.</div>

One can imagine a some quite useful information to be stored in there. For example, it would be a good opportunity to remove those two lousy bits "Italic" and "Bold" from the specs, and replaced with something more substantive (a weight number?).</div>

The first skewer-words are always the best-est: What a font-specific model of meta data will do is create contradictory and redundant data.;)

I've been to the XML mountain, and IT'S GreAt! But where we were, (when I started the size and epar table discussions), is a far distance to universal XML c.f.f. compliance. 

So as great as another new format might be, I thought then, that we required a transition period that could either occur in public cooperatively, or in private competitively. I interpolated to the best solutions I could for a public, cooperative effort. This would have described, if not en-tabled, many of the subsequent problems users have encountered without such meta-data, in their current transitions from "expert-system" to "public-system" publishing. 

What you're saying about the ClearType Collection above, is that you optically sized that series for internationalization. 
Let me know when you've finished with the XMLCFF upgrade, in the mean time, literally, don't worry, I'll handle it. 

John>Yes, although it still means putting family-level data within each individual font, which strikes me as less than ideal. 

Arguing for the future is great, but dealing with users is nourishing. My apologies in advance if you don't know what I'm talking about... again. ;) But John, this is not much different from sitting before a 144 dpi monitor, for years, reading black on yellow and telling me there is no windows rendering problem. 

Cheers!

Size information, i.e. information that tells software which 'cut' of a typeface to use in a particular nominal size range -- leaving aside, for now, the related or parallel situations of particular ppem size range, particular rendering engines, etc., and all the other situations that might be capturable --, is something that needs to be interpretable by software. Sure, one can put human-readable info in a font that gives advice on how and where to use that font, but until software automatically selects the correct font for particular circumstances from within a family, there is no real solution. I don't see putting information in a font and hoping that software somewhere will do something other than ignore it as a ‘transitional solution’. Your approach does indeed entail a valuable exercise in describing ‘the subsequent problems users have encountered without such meta-data’, but that process does not require or even presume a specific technical implementation: it's worth doing in any case.

The existence of the GPOS 'size' feature and a significant number of fonts using this feature (made by the same company whom one might expect to be first in line to support such a feature in their applications), for more than a decade, combined with the near-complete failure of support for that feature is strong evidence that simply sticking this information in a font and hoping for the best is not viable. So long as size selection is seen as an optional extra to existing font support, there is little impetus to software developers to do anything to support it.

And please note that I am <em>not</em> saying that in-font meta data <em>will</em> create contradictory data; I am saying that an architecture that makes contradictory data a possibility requires software makers to come up with protocols to handle such an eventuality, and this is a disincentive to supporting such an approach. You may not like it, but looking for data redundancies is one of the first things software makers do when they examine a technology, and one of the things they strive to avoid. [The OpenType format already suffers from multiple redundancies, in large part due to the bolting on of the CFF table. Redundancies were also one of the objections to EOT, which replicated individual font data at the wrapper level. CFS is being designed specifically to avoid redundancies.]

If, on the other hand, size selection is an integral part of a new composite font mechanism -- one that MS, Adobe and Apple have all demonstrated a strong desire to support first through their individual implementations of proprietorial composite font formats (this is already shipping software, not some future intangible) and second through their active engagement in developing a common, open standard --, then it becomes something that gets supported through fresh implementation of that new mechanism, rather than something requiring changes to existing font support.

I'm not ‘arguing for the future’. I bring this up now because <em>now</em> is when the standardisation process for CFS is taking place, and if size selection is something we're interested in seeing in the standard then now is when we need to have this discussion and engage with this process. And, David, in case I'm not clear enough: I would value your input and influence in that process, because I don't think I can alone make size selection a priority.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, I'll keep my eyes peeled for your thread. 

But I'm sure you know this first: discrete digital outline fonts are what we say they are, and as such they can't help but be contradictory; If one of us says Roman, and another Medium, and a third says it's Book, and a fourth makes all four, that's what? If one of us says we made a 4-style type family for text and display, screen and print, is that not contradictory?  And if a single WOFF lands on a user's desktop via @fontface, and it describes that it has nine "brothers" and 59 "cousins", is that redundant?

To wrap up my input on Greg's paper:

The WP's Conclusion:<em> Significant effort has been taken to make ClearType perform optimally for Microsoft Windows. </em>

I think this is the case as one can see, but what about Microsoft Windows Users? There are a lot of corporations and users that don't work well on Windows and I think more effort is required.

<em>Continued support from font hinters is necessary in order that fonts will continue to be the most readable and legible on many types of displays and many types of rendering environments.</em>

Is it forthcoming fast enough? Frothcoming perhaps... and speaking of which, isn't a quality hinting supply likely to be killed by @ff as practiced today, with simple-to-steal derivatives being served?

<em>This paper has described the techniques used to make existing, unmodified fonts work correctly with ClearType,</em>

I'd need a fairly broad definition of 'unmodified' and 'correctly'. Mine is to allow experts to apply their skills to broaden typographic availability with improved quality over the passage of time for Windows users.

<em>...but more importantly it provides the information to developers of new fonts on how to assure the consistent behavior of the TrueType interpreter for fonts by using the INSTCTRL instruction. </em>

ahem. 

And... it would have less contradictory if the paper just said; all size-independent x hints are ignored, and all y-size-independent hints are strictly required. 

I agree with John, it would have been less redundant for MS, and all of us developers, if they had just adopted the T1 format in 1989. 

Cheers!
