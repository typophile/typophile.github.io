  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Civilized discussions require civilized rules. We call these little gatherings <strong>forums</strong> in part, I suppose, because they are patterned after the <em>fora</em> (the correct Latin plural, for what it's worth) that existed at the heart of Roman towns. They began as marketplaces, like the Greek <em>agora</em>, but gradually evolved into each town's civic center. The most famous of these was, of course, The Forum in Rome proper. Here, the great orators of the Republic and the early empire presented their cases directly to the people.

The great Roman orators developed a wide range of techniques in order to present their arguments forcefully, and these techniques form the basis of the art/science we know as rhetoric. When the goal was frank and open discussions of a topic, the techniques were straightforward and direct; when the goal was winning an argument, period, the techniques were often underhanded and well disguised. One of the orators' most forceful (and enduring) tricks was the <em>argumentum ad hominem</em>, in which an opponent's arguments were sidestepped, and his character was attacked. Most if not all of us are familiar with this phenomenon: today, we call it "trash talking" or "politics as usual in the US of A." One should note that, however effective this technique has proven in the political arena, within the confines of formal debate it is considered a <strong>logical fallacy</strong>, and therefore weakens--rather than strengthens--the argument of the person employing it. Calling someone else–or his or her ideas–stupid, explicitly or implicitly, doesn't make you any smarter or your ideas any better...ever.

We are all, to one degree or another, ignorant. Ignorance is no shame. We are <em>all</em> born ignorant;  ideally, we become less so as we grow and learn. In these forums, we can have a frank exchange of ideas; we can share–when we can--the knowledge we have gained; and we can learn from others who have gained other, different knowledge. Let's keep it positive.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Even though it's cool to see more than the typo side of the various personalities here, very cool actually, arguements made with an 'opponent' in mind usually seem to forget that there maybe 50 other readers on the thread and consequently are less useful to the rest of us.

On the other hand it's unlikely that flames will ever be completely avoided. When I have read a thread that has descended into a flame war I often just go read something else or shake my head. 

I wonder what if anything can be said in a thread to cool things off. I imagine if I was in a flame war & somebody wrote "Let's keep it positive.' I might find that irritating.

On the other hand, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure...

So for what it's worth, Oldnick, I agree with your thrust!</div>

One thing I myself would elaborate on is your "a frank exchange of ideas". Civility is a means to enable this; it does not make up for having selfish intentions in frequenting a place. The grand old "Ask not what..." To me at least, good intentions are the foundation of any healthy society.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, selfish motives are always with us, frail humans that we are. They may be a weakness, but they are the most common weakness there is, so <strong>no one</strong> can be faulted for having them. And, although it has often...perhaps <em>too</em> often...been said that "The Road to Hell is paved with good intentions," I think that the fast track to Hell is paved entirely without them. Good intentions don't always yield <em>good</em> results, but bad intentions almost always yield <em>bad</em> results. To my find, trying and failing occasionally is a lot more admirable, commendable and estimable than never trying at all. But that's just my opinion...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Nick's notion to talk about rhetoric is a good one, but I think he makes a couple of misleading statements about the history and nature of rhetoric. The western rhetorical tradition begins with the Greeks, not the Romans, and most of the technical terminology of formal rhetoric is Greek not Latin. Interestingly, the <em>argumentum ad hominem</em> seems to be an exception, suggesting that this regretable addition to rhetoric might have been a Roman contribution, or at least more widely practised by the Romans than the Greeks. And it is regretable, but I'm not sure that I would classify it as a logical fallacy. A logical fallacy is a flaw in a logical argument that is independent of the truth of the argument, a kind of architectural flaw in the structure of the argument. The <em>argumentum ad hominem,</em> at least as recently practiced on Typophile, seems to me less of a flaw in the logic of an argument than an outright abandonment of an argument in favour of mere insult. The <em>argumentum ad hominem</em> as logical fallacy would be something along the lines of 'X cannot equal Y, as you claim, because you're an idiot'. Simply saying 'You're an idiot' doesn't even rise to the level of a logical fallacy: it is just an absence of charity.

What may be termed 'political rhetoric' -- the form of rhetoric we encounter most often through our various media -- tends to what would have been considered sophistry by the Greeks; that is, it seeks to persuade according to an agenda, which may or may not have any interest in truth; it may not even reflect what the sophist actually believes. The sophists were criticised and condemned by Sokrates, Plato, Aristotle, Isokrates and others, but their influence on political rhetoric is observable throughout subsequent history. The notion that one can persuade people of what is advantageous to oneself is compelling. The sophistic understanding of rhetoric is as <em>techne,</em> a technical method (to achieve an end).

Although sophism stands condemned, rhetoric itself does not. There is a hermeneutic tradition of rhetoric in which the tools of rhetorical persuasian are put at the service of a mutual search for truth. There is a funny exchange in <em>A century of philosophy</em> in which, over several pages, Riccardo Dottori asks the late Hans Georg Gadamer about various aspects of philosophy, particularly ethics, to all of which Gadamer replies 'That too is rhetoric'. For Gadamer, seemingly all of philosphy comes down to this hermeneutic rhetoric through which two people go in search of the truth or, at least, of deeper understanding, through the process of conversation. To identify ethics with rhetoric is, obviously, to be talking about something other than the sophistic or political rhetoric of persuasian to advantage. Rhetoric, understood in this sense, is an ethical and social <em>praxis,</em> rather than the <em>techne</em> of the sophist. Rhetoric is practical, but understanding this requires a classical appreciation of the difference between practical and technical, and the association of the practical with <em>phronesis</em>, practical wisdom. Our modern notions of rhetoric, which are almost entirely sophist and negative (to the degree that we often <em>accuse</em> someone of employing rhetoric), erase the distinction between the practical and the technical, debasing the practical to the pragmatic.

The key to this kind of hermeneutic and practical rhetoric is charity, which means, among other things, that the <em>argumentum ad hominem</em> has no place in it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">By the way, I also have some disagreement with Nick's opening assertion: 'Civilized discussions require civilized rules.' Civilised rules are what we require in the absence of civility; rules compensate for inadequate civility. And civility itself is often a poor substitute for what really benefits discourse, which is intellectual charity. Civility might mean nothing more than not telling the person you despise that you despise him, or not telling the person you consider an idiot that you think he is an idiot. The philosophical principle of charity, in which we suspend our prejudices in order to comprehend new ideas, is at its core a methodological principle -- a means to understanding, from which more accurate criticism can be made --, but it also fosters charity toward the Other, and this is part of the social praxis of rhetoric. Yes, these things can be addressed through rules, but if there is a human commitment to charity or, if charity is beyond us, to civility, then the rules are redundant.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>Ad hominem</em> arguments and uncivil behaviour are not the only evil that may harm discourse. You can argue correctly and politely, within the agreed rules, and still damage the fruitful exchange of ideas. Just look at two lawyers scoring points off each other. They are not interested in the other side's views and ideas, except to discredit them or turn them against their opponent. They only want to win. That is their job. That sort of argumentation is just as unwelcome as slinging insults or provoking a shouting match.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, John, for the clarifications and historical background. I didn't mean to suggest that rhetoric began with the Romans, but since the word "forum" is Roman/Latin in origin, it seemed like a logical place to start. And, please note that I said that the <em>argumentum ad hominem</em> is considered a logical fallacy "in formal debate": that is, in debating contests, judged by a set of rules (Google <em>ad hominem</em> and see what you get).

Glyn, I agree with what you say, but there are some instances when winning an argument <em>is</em> important. For example, in high school chemistry class, we did an experiment: teams of two lab partners each were given ten drops of a solution, and a detailed set of instructions of things we were to do to the solution. If we followed all of the steps correctly, we would end up with table salt; if we faltered along the way, we would end up with caustic soda. The only method available for testing our end product was to taste it. If we followed the plan, the result was a familiar savory sensation; if not, the result was a badly burned tongue.

In that particular instance, if partners diverged in their opinions as to what the instructions meant or if an operation had been performed properly, it was a matter of some importance that the correct opinion prevail. Here, in these forums, we are not dealing with the same kind of thing: generally, our discussions revolve around matters of taste or methods to achieve specific results. In the former instances, Thomas Aquinas' observation ought to be respected: <em>De gustibus non disputandum est</em>; that is, matters of taste cannot be debated. In the latter instances, the tools and techniques discussed here usually afford more than one way to skin a cat, or to get from Point A to Point B. In those cases, whatever works for each individual is the best method <em>for that individual</em>. Strokes for folks...

		<div class="commentbody">John, it depends on how you use these terms, but I think the basis for good manners is respect rather than charity. Charity is more demanding.  In the interesting book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0521292506/qid=1120139933/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-8026900-5275267?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">'Questions and Politeness'</a> the authors, anthropologists, identify the avoidance of embarassment to the other person as the prime mover of what is considered good manners in all societies. 

Incidentally, my memory may be playing tricks on me, but I believe the 'ad hominem' argument is already discussed in Aristotle's 'De Sophisticus Elenchis', the first book on logical fallacies.

		<div class="commentbody">I suppose it depends on what your definition of <em>argument</em> is. An argument can be "a fact or assertion offered as evidence that something is true." Or it may be "a discussion in which reasons are advanced for and against some fact or assertion," thus making it an argument about arguments. Since the second definition posits positions for and against, debate will naturally ensue. Debate can be sedate, calm, reasoned, orderly; or it can be lively, spirited, even heated. But the real bottom line is, what do you expect the debate to accomplish? If you're after the truth (or at least a reasonable facsimile thereof), it doesn't matter who wins or loses the debate, as long as you arrive somewhere in the near vicinity of your goal. If, on the other hand, the whole idea is to prove that you are right and the other guy is wrong, you might be a lawyer or a politician.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The concept of civility (or courtesy, politeness or what have you) may be interpreted in a variety of ways, but it all boils down to one simple precept: treat other people in the same manner in which you would like to be treated (the old Golden Rule thing). Unless, of course, you truly <em>enjoy</em> being verbally abused; if that's the case, there are <em>other</em> forums on the internet for people like you.

Charity certainly demands no less of us than civility thus defined; in a perfect world, charity would also mean loving other people in the same manner in which you would like to be loved. That's a much taller order.</div>

The distinction between charity and respect is actually important 
ethically and to discussion decorum. 

The importance is that we are obliged to respect all people, but we 
are not obliged to be charitable to all people. That is why it is 
fair to demand good manners from everyone in a public discussion, but 
not fair or reasonable to demand that they be equally kind and 
generous and concerned about everybody. 

I could go on about different historical concepts of charity and 
respect, but this is probably more information than you want. The 
bottom line is that it is justified--and in my mind a good thing--for 
a moderator to cut off a person (including me!) who launches into a 
personal attack, or to remove such a posting or part of it. But it is 
not justified to castigate people in a public discussion for not 
being more helpful, kind, etc., even though these are extremely 
admirable qualities. </div>

It really all depends on what passes for honesty. If someone you know is wearing what you consider to be a hideous outfit (poorly coordinated colors, mismatched patterns, a style that doesn't suit his/her physique), is NOT mentioning this "fact" polite, whereas POINTING IT OUT is honest?

Back to Aquinas: matters of taste cannot be argued. You don't like the outfit: that's your taste. The other person is wearing the outfit: that's their taste. Who's right? Who's wrong? Nobody. Everybody.

Also, I would like to add that I do not wish to be dismissive, but "fires of honesty" is a 100%, pure, USDA bulls**t term.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You hit the nail on the head there, oldnick. The intention driving the argument is the important thing.

On the original topic of civilised rules: perhaps these are needed on a web forum because the natural mechanisms that regulate behaviour tend to fail in this new environment. This would be the same as needing rules for driving on the road, which is not something that humans are naturally adapted for. We do not need rules for walking.

What is special about a web forum that makes such rules necessary? We can have heated discussions amongst strong-minded people around a table, and this can still be friendly and fruitful, even when sprinkled with insults and point-scoring. The same kind of behaviour on a web forum does seem to get out of control sometimes. I must say, I have not seen much of this on typophile, but I gather from tiffany's comment that it can be a real problem.

By the way, oldnick, did they really poison students at your school? At my school, we just got exciting explosions and stuff.

Indeed (although I would quibble about that "natural"). There are three main reasons for this:
1) Lack of gesture. In face-to-face communication a tiny smirk can do wonders to express one's true stance. The absence of gestures reduces communication, and can allow [certain] people to assume greater animosity than there is.
2) The big one: the internet removes the factor of geography. People get along better with people closer to their physical environment. The wider you cast the net, the more the tension. Now just imagine if the poor masses of this earth suddenly had internet access - they'd flame & shame us into the ground...  :-/
3) Immediacy: the two points above wouldn't be so bad if the damn thing wasn't so <strong>fast</strong>! Think of writing snailmail letters, which are much less liable to cause friction, simply because you have a lot more time to tone things down, to <strong>control</strong>. This immediacy is closer to our raw soul. In the big picture, it is a good thing. (So is #2.)

These three reasons combine to make one attribute more important than either civility or candor: tolerance. You need titanium skin and a cast-iron spine. Without tolerance, it's all a sham.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">On the tension between politeness and seeking the truth. 

This is a genuine tension, as the anthropologists I cited above point 
out in their book. Seeking the truth requires clarity and frankness, 
but politeness requires not saying anything that might embarrass the 
other person. The tactics of politeness involves artful ambiguity and 
open questions--How are you?--that a person can take any way he or 
she wants. 

Searching for the truth in a discussion often involves disagreement 
and debate, and it is easy to give and take offense when the other 
person's heartfelt opinions are contradicted. 

The standard that has evolved for scholarly discussions is 
*relevance* to the topic being discussed: contradiction and criticism 
are permitted if you stay on the issue being discussed. If you stay 
relevant, and disagreement over which solution to a problem or side 
of an issue is best, then the discussants are expected not to take 
offense, even if their cherished views are contradicted and 
criticised. What is out of bounds by this standard are personal 
attacks--attacks on the character of the other person. 

Both the statement of Grice and my second century quote emphasize the 
importance of relevance, staying on topic, for discussion in search 
of the truth. 

The problem with this standard for Typophile is that what we do here 
is a mixture of discussion of specific topics, and a conversation on 
whatever happens to interest us. Thus a thread that starts off with a 
discussion of one topic can hit on another topic, and change course 
completely, sometimes to the delight and sometimes to the distress of 
the participants.

If the threads are kept on topic, then the chances of people giving 
and taking offense is much reduced. 

However, I for one enjoy the way our conversations enble us to 
discover new interests and ideas from one another, without staying to 
the strict rails of a discussion. 

But this means that we must take great care, especially when the 
topics of politics and religion come up, not to engage in personal 
attacks.

I'd like to keep the freewheeling conversation of Typophile without 
the rancor that keeps popping up, but I have to admit that it hasn't 
happened. 

A 'new topic, new thread' rule would probably keep things more civil, 
but it would be less fun. My solution is for moderators to have a 
much heavier hand cutting out personal attacks, but I must admit this 
creates unpleasant work for someone else who is probably also here 
for their own amusement.

So the only solution seems to be self-restraint, which so far isn't 
working that well.  </div>

So I think pragmatism points to taking responsability on one's self (specifically here via "extreme tolerance"*, I guess like Jesus, Gandhi or something) instead of trying to get other people to behave like you want them to. Typophile, after all, is not a state; it's more like a smelly, luscious watering hole!  :-)

* Personally the only thing I would censure is a full-on defamation campaign, where a person shows up basically to bring down somebody, via bringing down a whole community if need be. This, I have been the victim of, in the past.

Surely it is better working principal for everyone to be polite, rather than impervious to personal slights.

It depends whether you're the aggressor, or acting in self defence.
Surely one has a right to ask an aggressor to cease and desist.

I think your point about needing new rules in new environments is well taken, as are Hrant's observations on the subject. As powerful and rich as written language can be, it can never approach the rich, nouanced level that a good old-fashioned <em>tête-à-tête</em> can achieve. Emoticons are a somewhat feeble attempt at nouance, I suppose, but I tend to find them annoying, rather than helpful (my personal opinion, not a judgment).

And, Glyn, no, they didn't try to poison us in high school chem lab. I went to an all-boys prep school run by the Jesuits. Since the rack and the Iron Maiden had long since been abandoned as instruments of compliance by Holy Mother the Church, the Jesuits had come up with far more devious ways of enforcing compliance with the rules. As the experiment and its possible results were presented to us, noncompliance was not an option; as a result, everyone in the class completed the experiment successfully, no thumbscrews required.</div>

The trouble is that I haven't been sure of what I thought exactly. I am still not there quite but a few ideas have surfaced that I think I might be able to stand behind. At the risk of just stirring up more dust to no effect...

One, is that I do want to see as much participation on the board as is possible. For selfish reasons really. I learn alot here & that is wonderful. So while I agree with Hrant that it would be great if Jonathan Hoefler* was to hang out & respond to & start tons of threads. It probably isn't going happen, he is proabably pretty busy & he may not find it too useful - or for whatever reason. He doesn't need a reason. Obviously he can & does speak for himself, but my point is that 

a. If he doesn't post that doesn't make him ( or anyone) a bastard.
b. Insulting him isn't likely to help.

*Or pick any other typo-luminary who isn't here much, I have a list of a dozens and dozens I'd like to see here more - or even at all. Too bad some of them are dead. :-(

In my own defense - it isn't sooo selfish. I miagine that we can all afford to learn something more.

So to all of us, I would ask you to do what you can to encourage participation because it seems like we all have far far more to gain that way. If that means not verbally stabbing them*, ( despite the fact that maybe they deserve it ),  then that what I am asking for. I want to learn. 

*or choose your own analogy I am not wedded to that one

Two, At the same time, Hrant is right that you can ignore him ( or anybody else ) if you want. If he has gotten under you skin you may have on some level allowed him to do that. I am not saying it's the 'victim's fault'. I am just saying that we have choices about how we respond. Less may really be much much more in this case.

Three, Our good Mr. Pemberton was right when he decided not to edit posts. Give em enough rope & all of that sort of thing. We can all decide who we want to talk back to and who we take seriously. Maybe there are kids on the board but in most cases we are adults here and happily, with trails of posts to look at, we can all draw our own conclusions about the authors.

Four, Thanks to everybody here on Typophile. I really appreciate your spending the time here.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the thread everyone... someone already said respect and charity. I'll add a few more.

<strong>Humility</strong>
I think a dose of humility helps. The most basic kind of humility suggests that we're always willing to learn something new, or at a minimum, able to hear someone else's point of view.

<strong>Benefit of the Doubt</strong>
Before jumping to conclusions, give someone the benefit of the doubt.

<strong>Kindness</strong>
"A pot of honey draws more flies." In other words, kindness is a better blanket to wrap your persuasive debate with than rudeness, harshness or bluntness. If your aim is to influence someone's thinking, try being kind - even if you're correcting them or telling them something they might disagree with. Novel idea.</div>

The way I always heard it was that an Irishman was a person that can tell you to go to hell and make you look forward to the trip (and, lest any Irish among us take offense, my father's mother was born in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, so I am genaeologically and genetically entitled to tell Irish jokes). A diplomat, I have heard tell, is a person sent abroad to lie for his country.

Joe, three excellent points, especially the humility thing: that's probably the single most difficult virtue to practice, perhaps more so for bright people, and these forums are blessed with a lot of such folk.

One more thing I would add to the list of attitudes/behaviors that don't contribute anything of benefit to these forums are attempts to be <strong>clever</strong>.</div>

I am utterly overwhelmed: with just <strong>two</strong> brilliantly chosen words, you managed, simultaneously, to...

I believe it was Erving Goffman who said 'the wit is the hero of 
conversation.' The wit brings some humor and fun to conversation, 
which is no small thing. I appreciate Chris's wit, and think that it 
is a happy and positive contribution to Typophile.

I have found myself agreeing with the vast majority of what you have said up until this point. Wit is always appreciated; sarcasm--its lowest form, according to an old Italian saying--is not appreciated, nor is the kind of "cleverness" which is only self-serving to the supposed wit, and contributes nothing of value, least of all humor.

In this particular instance, I believe the intention was not to amuse, but to belittle. If I am mistaken in this matter, I apologize. If I am not mistaken...what is the Human Torch's catchline?</div>

OldNick--I never intended to slam you, your ideas, or anyone else's ideas on this forum. Forums are meant for open exchange of ideas. Perhaps it is my failing to be so tempted to coax humor out of any situation. In your case, I will never attempt to make you laugh again because I see it has had the opposite affect. 

I apologize for any offense you may have taken from my words. Nothing negative was intended.

		<div class="commentbody">Chris,

I will gladly accept your apology if you will accept mine, previously tendered. Despite any seeming evidence to the contrary, I am not a humorless old curmudgeon. I have been known to snicker, chuckle, chortle, guffaw and even howl at times when confronted with good-natured humor.  In my high school, wit was a competitive sport and, although I never achieved the unanimous acclaim of my peers as the ultimate practitioner, I held my own during many an impromptu circle smirk. I also recognize and appreciate the many amusing points which have been advanced by visitors to this particular forum. However, you will notice that, when presenting <strong>humor</strong>, the person who posts it either credits the source, or says "I have heard it said..." or some other method of attribution. The <strong>clever</strong> person does not say "Here's a witty story," but rather "I am a witty person." In the former instance, sharing something amusing with others is like making love; in the latter instance, stroking your own ego is like...well, you get the picture.

Misunderstandings happen: intent may not be what it appears to be. As has been mentioned previously, we suffer because the page is our stage, and relevant contextual indicators like tone of voice or a twinkle in the eye can't be heard or seen in print, emoticons notwithstanding.</div>
