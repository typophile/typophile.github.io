body: "The caron on a /dcaron/, /lcaron/ and /tcaron/ shouldn't really look like an
  apostrophe, should it? Supposing my /commaaccent/ looks like a /comma/, is it fair
  game for my alternative caron to look more like an straight stroke, angled from
  1 o'clock down to 7 o'clock? Look forward to your thoughts, especially if you're
  Czech.\r\n\r\nN"

  body: From my research it seems that Czechs are not very picky about what the caron
    looks like as long as it does not look like the punctuation in the same font.

  body: Strikes me that the modified caron way too often looks like the comma/quoteright.
    It's got nothing to do with the comma, right?

  body: Nick, have you checked Victor Gaultney's Problems of Diacritic Design? I'm
    sure there was something in there about it...from memory it needs to be pretty
    straight, not as round as the apostrophe.
