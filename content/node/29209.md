  2000\r\n\r\nFor their work in cell phone advertising, the three designers ([[Maik
  Ignaszak]], [[Stefan Kisters]], and [[Astrid Scheuerhorst ]]) were constantly in
  need of display type for phones from Nokia, Motorola, Siemens, etc. As PostScript
  versions of these fonts weren't commercially available, either from the companies
  themselves or from various type libraries, they decided to make their own. The result
  is FF Call, a package of over 70 fonts from a dozen brands of cellular phones. Each
  design comes in three versions: Regular, Italic and Negative, plus Expert Sets.\r\n\r\nCompatibility
  list:\r\n\r\nFF Call One - Alcatel\r\nFF Call Two - Bosch\r\nFF Call Three - Ericsson\r\nFF
  Call Four - Motorola\r\nFF Call Five - Nokia\r\nFF Call Six - Panasonic\r\nFF Call
  Seven - Philips\r\nFF Call Eight - Siemens\r\nFF Call Nine - Sony\r\n\r\n<strong>External
