body: "I am not sure whom to address it, probably to someone from Adobe sales dept.,
  hopefully Tom will forward it. It is probably also not a very original idea, but
  surely it would make life of a type designer easier:\r\n\r\nWould it be possible
  for Adobe (and other software developers) to sell a special font developers' license?
  I have been buying a Mac license of InDesign just to test my fonts in each version.
  The problem is when I get a customer complaining that some feature (e.g. SMCP) is
  not working in a InDesign CE. Or Greek glyphs are not working on the Greek version.
  Or some peculiar problem with PC version. The thing is that these applications would
  be used perhaps only for a day or two a year, so basically it is not realistic that
  I can license all different versions of InDesign to investigate possible font problems,
  not to mention other Adobe products, which only multiply the problem.\r\n\r\nHaving
  fonts tested in all commercial software is critical for a font developer, and I
  suppose it is also in Adobe's interest that the fonts function well on their software.
  \r\n\r\nA solution could be making a special package for type designers who produce
  commercial products, a kind of yearly subscription for which they could license
  <cite>all</cite> Adobe DTP applications. No one is to lose anything, and Adobe can
  perhaps generate few more cents.\r\n\r\nIdea?\r\n\r\nPeter Bilak\r\nTypotheque.com"

  body: "I'm with you on this. It's not enough that type developers OUGHT to have
    at least three operating systems (Win, Classic Mac plus the latest flavor of OS
    X...I have Linux, too, but rarely use it), but we really ought to have the latest
    apps in at least two versions (Win and OS X) to test our products properly.\r\n\r\nFor
    large type houses, the cost may not be burdensome, but for a lot of us small guys,
    the several thousand dollars it costs to keep current is a problem.\r\n\r\nAcademic
    versions of most popular programs are sold at a substantial discount; it seems
    to me that developer versions ought to be available, too."

    price isn't cheap, but Adobe certainly is. It used to be, for your $995, that
    you got complete boxed sets of all new Adobe releases for both PC and Mac. Now,
    you have to download the new releases, which can consume a lot of productive time
    (even if, like my boss, you have a T1 line)."
