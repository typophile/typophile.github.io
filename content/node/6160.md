body: I&#39;m thinkig about purchasing a page layout program but really don&#39;t
  know which one. I hear Quark can be a hassle and InDesign is simple to use. But
  the problem is that Quark is more widely used in the design field as far as I know.
  Is there a trend where more and more designers are using InDesign? I would appreciate
  some feedback on this issue. <BR> <BR>IM

  body: Ivan, I dumped Quark a couple of years ago. But its because all of my applications
    are Adobe and they work well together. Quark is more expensive, InDesign handles
    type better. As for service bureaus, Adobe is very active in teaching service
    bureaus how to handle InDesign documents. Having said that I&#39;m from New York
    City and Adobe might not be as active in your area. Just some thoughts

    InDesign! I&#39;m from Brooklyn, NY so I think I&#39;ll have no problem. Are you

    different things that I can do to improve the performance, well this would make
    me very happy. &#40;sorry ... thought someone needed to post about this too.&#41;

  body: It is true that I have certain clients who still use Quark themselves and
    so I also use Quark. But, when my clients ask me which they should use I tell
    them InDesign in spite of what I see as a major draw back &#40;speed&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>The reason I use Indy when I can is that I find it to be more intuitive as
    a over all tool. And although I do not do any localization or alternate language
    work I do use Opentype when I can as I&#39;ve found recently that most of the
    type I&#39;m licensing is OpenType.

  body: InDesign CS, Tom? You can drag any palette to the side of the <BR>screen and
    all but the title bar will slide out of view, acting as a  <BR>sort of pop-up
    palette. I love this. I wish Illie and PS had this. <BR> <BR>Also, you needn&#39;t
    have any palettes open at all. Just open them <BR>when you need them. Remember
    Quark? It only gave you the <BR>option of a Color, Layout, Style, and Measurements
    palette. The <BR>rest of the commands are only accessible via dialog boxes. Boo!
    <BR>I&#39;d rather have the option of keeping on my screen those  <BR>commands
    I use most.

    Thats done in preferences.  <BR> <BR>Steve Indy stold the nested pallets idea
    from GoLive, the difference being GoLive lets you store the pallets at the bottom
    of the screen too!
