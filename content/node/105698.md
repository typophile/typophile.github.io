  body: "It would really help if you said where you obtained this image -- old book,
    webpage, etc.\r\nSeems to me this is not from a digital font but from some other
    blackletter text.\r\nYou can compare it with a rather diverse collection of old
    blackletters at:\r\nhttp://moorstation.org/typoasis/blackletter/\r\nDon\r\n"
