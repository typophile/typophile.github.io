  harassing graphic designers for not promoting the interests of visual communicators

  ending up with a job teaching media design last fall.</dd></em>\r\n<dt><strong>Winter</strong></dt>\r\n<dd><em>Teaching
  being great, but feeling like one eye leading the blind with regards to digital
  technical skills.</dd></em>\r\n<dd><em>Not feeling any special connection to these
  digital skills, seeing how keeping them current would keep me from using other media,
  yet not wanting to let the effort of learning them go to waste.</dd></em>\r\n<dd><em>Figuring
  out that the most efficient thing to do would be to make my new-found geek skills
  and understanding of foss culture the vehicle for promoting my own skills and values
