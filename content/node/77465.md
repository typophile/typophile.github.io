  when Coke's new Christmas ad \"Shake Up Christmas\" came on.  The ad was cute, but
  what really grabbed my attention was the font they used at the end of the ad.  It
  was a slab serif font, but with the most beautiful rounded corners.  I tried searching
  for it on the net but wasn't successful.  I did manage to find the following though:\r\n\r\n<img

  src=\"http://typophile.com/files/Coke_Christmas_Font_02.jpg\"></img>\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://typophile.com/files/Coke_Christmas_Font_03.jpg\"></img>\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://typophile.com/files/Coke_Christmas_Font_04.jpg\"></img>\r\n\r\nI have
  a feeling that the font was designed by Coke for Coke, but hopefully I'm wrong."
