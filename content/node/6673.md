body: This Belgian company, Alt-Soft, has a new software for font edition and conversion,
  called FTM &#40;Font Type Master&#41;. It&#39;s a simple app, not really good for
  drawing or creating new fonts, there&#39;s not even a good metrics tool. <BR> <BR>But
  this app has a <i>very, very</i> interesting feature. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t post
  this here, but... it opens fonts from PDFs! Using the demo, I was able to open a
  font from a PDF file. Quick and easy. No kerning though. I just wasn&#39;t able
  to save the font because it is a demo &#40;no saving allowed&#41;. <BR> <BR>I will
  not post a link to this, but I think interested people will find it. <BR> <BR>Personally,
  I think this feature should be removed from this app. But, what do others think
  about it?

  body: I think this feature is stupid. When I see a specimen I prefer a pdf so I
    can print and see if the typeface works. Now foundries will remove their pdf.  <BR>Is
    it possible to open the fonts also from protected pdf?

  body: Who is supposed to use the feature, and for what purpose? There really isn&#39;t
    a legitimate need to open a font from a PDF, because if you have a legitimate
    right to open a font it is because you have a license which says you can, which
    means that you have the font.

  body: It looks like a nice engine for an font editor, but due to its feature set,
    its more a deluxe  ripper. <BR> <BR>It can&#39;t open protected pdfs, but experts
    will know how to do it.  <BR> <BR>So for pdf specimens, you should embed only
    a subset of your fonts and essential pages can be rendered as bitmaps only.
