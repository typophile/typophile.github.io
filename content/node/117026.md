body: "I would dearly love to identify the origins of this font.\r\n\r\nI have purchased
  an original hand-drawn folio page for my friend (a massive typophile) to celebrate
  the birth of her first child.\r\n\r\nThe lady who sold me the sheet indicated that
  this was a Linotype font although I can't attest to whether she knew her stuff or
  was making an educated guess.\r\n\r\nI've attached a photograph. The font seems
  to be called 'Paragon Roman' although web searches only came up with a modern font.
  The date in the lower left appears to be the 22nd of April 1927/37/47 although as
  it may be American, the date could be 27th April 1922.\r\n\r\nAny help or uidance
  in tracking down the original font would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nTom"

  body: "There is a serifed font called Paragon by Mergenthaler Linotype 1935 and
    Lionotype (London) designed by C. Griffith. The specimen in Jaspert's _Encyclopedia
    of Typefaces (1970)_ is a small point size but to my eye there is no conflict
    between the _o_ in the specimen and your hand drawn folio. Jaspert says that Paragon
    is lighter version of Excelsior -- same designer, 1931.\r\nBTW, the words _6PT
    PARAGON ROMAN_ are in another font.\r\nDon"
