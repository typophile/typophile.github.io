  have a lot of old paper, printing paper, some art paper.  I own an old manual typewriter
  or two as well, and some type specifying books and catalogs from typesetters and
  foundries long gone.\r\n\r\nRecently I heard about a font that was developed to
  use less ink making it more \"sustainable\".  \r\n\r\nRemember when Bell Gothic
  was developed?\r\n\r\nDo you remember when we went from hot to cold type?\r\n\r\nHow
  does the substrate impact our types?  Now that we spend at least as much time reading
  on a TV screen, what's happening to the words we print on paper?"

  body: "When I was doing my thesis I asked some people in the industry how they were
    approaching the digital medium. The answer was usually that they design for paper
    and let the Adobe autohinter do the rest; fonts carefully crafted for screens
    are still a niche. \r\n\r\nBut I do suspect that in the near future the typographic
    divide between Latin-1 and everyone else will widen. The developing world will
    do its reading on smartphones and netbooks and will mostly need screen fonts;
    in Western Europe and much of the Americas there will still be plenty of type
    designed for paper.\r\n\r\nPersonally I\u2019m really interested in working with
    DIY designers to build Photofonts from their various alphabets, but at this point
    I can\u2019t justify spending the money to jump into that tech. Figuring out how
    to target bitmaps for print and web will be an interesting challenge. "
