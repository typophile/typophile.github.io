  body: It's a Caslon I'm sure of it, but I don't know which one this is. Caslon 540
    seems close off the top of my head.

  body: seems like a display version of it, though, but not quite like Big Caslon

  body: If this was for the New York Times, it is probably a custom-property Caslon.
    The hairlines do indeed seem thinner and the numerals are different. If I recall
    correctly, Vogue's Caslon was based on Caslon 540, this could be the case here.

    Elsner+Flake has pretty thin hairlines.

    you see it big on the page, the hairlines are as thin as 72 point didot'

  body: "> Carter & Cone Big Caslon?\r\n\r\nIt isn't Big Caslon, I am 99.9% sure this
    is a custom Caslon based on Caslon 540*. See attached image for comparsion, the
    glyph widths of your sample matches Caslon 540.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for an
    exact match, I think you're out of luck. I think Big Caslon would be a great alternative
    if you're after a Caslon for display. But if you need to match the width of the
    glyphs exactly, I'd go with Caslon 540. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/casloncomp1.png]\r\n*
    The hairlines appear to be thinner but this could be attributed to the pixel-faires
    but the numeral 4 is distinctive in your sample."

  body: I wonder if they just took Caslon 540 and put a very thin white stroke around
    it
