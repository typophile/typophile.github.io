body: "Hey guys\r\nI am a noob at typeface design and i am wondering when should i
  start spacing my characters. I mean i have finished all small letters and i am doing
  caps right now.\r\nShould i construct all the letters( i mean symbols, punctuation,
  numbers) and then space or can start spacing simultaneously while designing the
  remaining? How do you guys do?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nM\r\n\r\nPS: above post might have
  information which might make you say \"you have gotta be kidding me\""

  body: Spacing and drawing should be treated as the same thing. The notion that letters
    should be drawn and then spaced is a leftover from the metal type era, when it
    had to be done differently.

  body: I agree that it's a good idea to space them as you're drawing. Also, especially
    when you're just starting out, expect to not space your glyphs once and then you're
    done spacing. It's usually quite an iterative process.

  body: "It's certainly true that glyphs, boumas and spacing are inseparable.\r\nIt
    is also true that a deep first-hand appreciation of this almost\r\nalways only
    comes with experience, so it's unreasonable to expect\r\na novice to apply (or
    even grasp) such a holistic approach. So there\r\nis a \"hybrid\" approach, which
    in fact seems to arise naturally most\r\nof the time in somebody following a classical
    education in type design\r\n(being self-taught :-) and that is iteration: making
    glyphs in ignorance\r\nof spacing, eventually seeing a problem in spacing, going
    back to change\r\nthe glyph(s), ad continuum. Such iteration is not naturally
    efficient,\r\nand it can never be the same as designing the glyphs with the holistic\r\nmindset,
    but repeated enough times results in quality work. The main\r\nthing to avoid
    is sticking too closely to an ideal of glyph shapes OR\r\nspacing, and as a result
    forcing one or the other into an unhealthy\r\nposition (which sadly does happen
    a lot).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
