  body: I initially thought the top one was Futura as well, but the A is not right
    and it is the A that gives this font its character.

  body: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)\r\n\r\nNote the apex. This
    is also a non-digital version, so there is bound to be some differences."

  body: Thankyou.  I take your point but I can't find a version of futura that does
    not have a blunt apex on the A for stronger weights.  Furthermore, I can't find
    any version that has the crossbar on the A low enough to evoke the same feeling
    as the font in the maths paper.  I guess this is a version of futura with a few
    tiny modifications, but it is those modifications that I am trying to identify
    :)

  body: I think it might have been set with the old Varityper strike-on typesetter,
    which was sort of like a typewriter. Especially because of the uneven baseline
    and spacing and odd proportions (all fonts had to fit the same proportions). Varityper
    had a Futura-like font called Techno Bold, which could be the font on the first
    line. I can't find any samples of it, so I'm not positive. They also had a version
    of Bodoni that looks very similar to the second line from what I have been able
    to find. I doubt either of these (or any of the other Varityper fonts) have been
    digitized. It was a very low-end system.

    for :)

  body: Mark is on the money; however, instead of calling it a "low-end system," it
    might be more proper to call it the one of the very first desktop publishing systems.
    Varityper was preceded by the Hammond Multiplex, but was a little more refined.
    Both machines could have two fonts "loaded" at one time, but the Varityper used
    variable spacing (four widths) and a tab-over-and-retype method to create justified
    text. With one of these machines, offset print shops could have an in-house typesetting
    department without the expense of hand-setting foundry type or purchasing a line-casting
    machine.
